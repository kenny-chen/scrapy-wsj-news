      <td>Policyholders from  Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.  will now be able to take photographs of their damaged cars and almost instantaneously generate a repair estimate.<br />The new offering is thanks to a partnership between  Hartford Financial  and London-based Tractable. The startup is at the forefront of a growing number of technology firms trying to help car insurers use techniques such as artificial intelligence, computer vision and machine learning to speed up claims processes. Founded in 2014, Tractable already is working with big insurers in Japan and Europe.<br />The collaboration with  Hartford Financial  signals that artificial-intelligence activity is heating up in the U.S. car-insurance market, industry executives and consultants said. Among other strategic efforts, giant car insurer USAA has been working since 2019 with  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google Cloud unit to develop a photo-based estimating program for its policyholders.<br />Under Tractable’s approach, computers study the damage in photographs, which can be taken by policyholders while still at the wreck site or later. To produce estimates, the algorithms tap into data from a provider of parts and labor data.<br />Once the estimate is generated, policyholders can select a recommended body shop and get the repair work started.</td>

They go sort of hand-in-glove.”<br />Many Republicans and some Democrats have balked at the cost of the administration’s proposal and suggested there would be bipartisan support for a smaller package focused on vaccine distribution, potentially a third round of direct checks and some other measures.</td>

Measured from the fourth quarter to the same quarter a year ago, the economy shrank 2.5%.<br />The coronavirus and related business disruptions put in place early in the pandemic upended the U.S. economy early last year, triggering business and school closures, a steep drop in demand for goods and services and record job losses.

The selloff has taken place amid wild swings in individual stocks including GameStop and AMC Entertainment, fueled by a battle between day traders and hedge-fund professionals.<br />“There is some over-excitement in the market,” said Olaf van den Heuvel, chief investment officer for Aegon Asset Management in the Netherlands, pointing to the surge in GameStop shares as one example. “It was bubble territory.”</td>

Abraaj before its fall had said it managed almost $14 billion for investors including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Bank of America Corp., the World Bank and the U.S. and U.K. governments. Mr. Naqvi is accused of taking hundreds of millions of dollars from the firm.<br />Mr. Naqvi was arrested at London’s Heathrow Airport in April 2019 as he returned from Pakistan, where he was born. He faces a prison sentence of up to 291 years if found guilty of all the charges from the Justice Department. He is currently under home confinement in London while out of custody on bail.<br />Judge Emma Arbuthnot announced her decision to allow Mr. Naqvi’s extradition in a London court Thursday. His lawyer last year argued that extradition would violate Mr. Naqvi’s human rights because U.S. jail conditions are so bad they raise the risk of making him suicidal if he was detained ahead of his trial. The case is now referred to the U.K. home secretary, and Mr. Naqvi will be able to appeal the decision, the judge said.<br />“His unshakable conviction is that he is entirely innocent,” Mr. Naqvi’s lawyer Hugo Keith said in court last year. Mr. Keith won a concession from the U.S. government last year that his client wouldn’t be detained ahead of trial in Manhattan’s Metropolitan Correctional Center, where Jeffrey Epstein died.</td>

      <td>The number of workers seeking unemployment benefits dropped last week, indicating a recent easing in the pace of layoffs though the labor market remains mired in a winter slowdown.<br />New jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, declined to 847,000 in the week ended Jan. 23, down from a revised 914,000 the week before.<br />The weekly tallies have remained for months well above the pre-pandemic peak of 695,000 and are higher than in any previous recession for records tracing back to 1967.<br />“The virus is in the driver’s seat—there’s no getting around it,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist and data scientist at Glassdoor, a company-ratings and job-listings website. “Until we control the pandemic, we can’t hope for a full recovery economically.”<br />Weekly jobless claims are volatile but have generally trended higher since November, when they were below 800,000, to 926,000 during the week of Jan. 9. They point to a slowing economic recovery, as surging coronavirus case numbers, fresh safety restrictions and colder weather hamper the labor market’s recovery from the initial shock of the pandemic last spring. Employers cut 140,000 jobs nationwide in December, with gains in many industries more than offset by losses at restaurants, bars, hotels and other businesses related to leisure and tourism.</td>

      <td>Consumers may be rushing back to their favorite restaurants as the pandemic eases, but convenience should continue to deliver for DoorDash</td>
      <td>Food-delivery platform  DoorDash  is now trading nearly 90% above its initial public offering price just as vaccines are being broadly distributed in the U.S. and restaurants in some of its largest markets are poised to reopen outdoor dining. So why isn’t this stock a screaming short?<br />The answer may be more about convenience than taste. In addition to restaurant delivery, DoorDash has been building up its market share in third-party delivery for other goods, such as those from the likes of 7-Eleven, Wawa, Circle K and CVS. Post-pandemic, those ancillary opportunities could prove to be more central to DoorDash’s growth thesis than bearish investors are appreciating.<br />The bulk of DoorDash’s appeal heading into its December IPO was how quickly it was able to go from 0 to 60 in food delivery. The company says it had just 17% U.S. market share in terms of total sales in January 2018 but that its share had grown to 50% as of last October—nearly twice that of its next-largest competitor, Uber Eats. Now it turns out that in more nascent markets like convenience delivery, DoorDash has been growing even more quickly.<br />A report out from Edison Trends Thursday shows DoorDash now owns 58% of U.S. convenience-store spending via third-party delivery apps, more than twice that of its next-largest competitor, goPuff. Last January, Edison Trends had DoorDash’s share at around 5% and goPuff at 70%. For all of Uber’s talk of leaning strongly into auxiliary delivery services, Uber Eats’ market share in third-party convenience goods is now just 8%, according to the report.<br />For DoorDash, the convenience market may be more than just icing on the cake. Based on Edison Trends’ analysis, overall online consumer spending at convenience stores grew nearly 350% in 2020, nearly three times faster than online restaurant consumer sales. DoorDash customers increased their convenience-store spending by 162% sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter, according to EdisonTrends’ data—a good sign for DoorDash’s first earnings report as a public company coming up late next month.</td>

      <td>Decline in cigarette sales stopped last year amid health concerns about e-cigarettes; ‘Trust the devil you know’</td>
      <td>The decadeslong decline in U.S. cigarette sales halted last year as people in lockdown lit up more frequently and health concerns around e-cigarettes caused some vapers to switch back to cigarettes.<br />Before the pandemic, U.S. cigarette unit sales had been falling at an accelerating rate, hitting 5.5% in 2019, as smokers quit or switched to alternatives like e-cigarettes. The pandemic put the brakes on that slide. In 2020, the U.S. cigarette industry’s unit sales were flat compared to the previous year, according to data released Thursday by Marlboro maker  Altria Group Inc.<br />People had more opportunities to smoke because they spent more time at home and had more money to spend on cigarettes because they spent less on gas, travel and entertainment, Altria said. At the same time, some e-cigarette users turned back to combustible cigarettes because of increased e-cigarette taxes, bans on flavored vaping products and confusion about the health effects of vaping, consumers and industry officials say.<br />U.S. cigarette sales were even stronger last year than they were in 2015, when many consumers switched back to cigarettes after trying first-generation vaping devices. Those early products didn’t deliver nicotine effectively enough to satisfy some addicted cigarette smokers. But e-cigarette sales took off again in 2017, spurred by the popularity of a new vaporizer called Juul.<br />E-cigarette sales were booming in the fall of 2019 when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, investigating an outbreak of a mysterious lung illness, warned consumers not to use any vaping products. Sales took a nosedive. The illness later was linked to vitamin E oil in marijuana vaping products, but the public’s perception of e-cigarette safety hasn’t rebounded and neither have sales.</td>

Several eurozone banks are due to report their annual results next week.<br />The true health of eurozone borrowers has become harder to track due to the amount of financial support from the ECB and the region’s governments, which includes payment holidays on existing loans. In Italy, for instance, over a quarter of loans to businesses are under payment moratoriums. In Portugal, half of the credit to companies in the hospitality and restaurant sectors are under the program.</td>

      <td>Oil refiners and ethanol producers’ collective pain hasn’t done much to align their interests</td>
      <td>In the tug of war for former President Donald Trump’s favors, oil refiners won some surprising victories over ethanol producers. Their fortunes are about to flip under President Joe Biden’s climate-driven administration.<br />The fate of U.S. oil refiners and ethanol are inextricably linked through the so-called Renewable Fuel Standard, which sets annual quotas for the quantity of ethanol and biodiesel that must be blended into transportation fuels. The burden of meeting the blending requirements falls on those that refine or import oil. Those unable to meet any given year’s quota must fulfill it by buying Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) in the open market from those who have blended gallons to spare.<br />But sometimes the price of those RINs becomes excessively burdensome. Much to the ethanol industry’s chagrin, the Environmental Protection Agency issued 85 exemptions for refiners unable to meet the required blending requirements under the Trump administration—a big jump from the 23 given out during Barack Obama’s second term (prior to that, small refiners were automatically exempted). Exemptions are granted if refiners can prove they were unable to meet obligations without running into “disproportionate economic hardship.” The issue came into focus in 2018 when refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions went bankrupt, partly blaming Renewable Fuel Standard-related payments. That same year refiner  CVR Energy ,  owned by former Trump adviser Carl Icahn, also got a valuable exemption.<br />The next four years are likely to be tougher for oil refiners seeking relief. For one, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in January 2020 that the Environmental Protection Agency wrongly exempted three refineries from renewable fuel requirements. Its ruling also narrowed down the number of refiners that would qualify for future exemptions. Since that ruling, RIN prices have skyrocketed, fetching about 10 times what they did a year ago, according to data from S&P Global Platts. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to take up the case after two refiners appealed the decision.<br />The Biden administration has signaled climate issues as one of its priorities. New leadership at the EPA will be in charge of determining blending obligations for 2021, which the previous administration didn’t set by the Nov. 30 deadline. The new volume obligations likely won’t emerge until the second half of the year. Corey Lavinsky, director of global biofuels at S&P Global Platts, notes that Biden’s EPA is likely to set strong mandates for 2021 and 2022 and to enforce them.</td>

The program teaches officers to step in when another officer—including a higher-ranking one—uses excessive force or goes against police department guidelines.<br />More than 70 police departments large and small, from Orlando, Fla., and Washington, D.C., to Lafourche Parish, La., have enrolled in the program since it launched last June. Last month, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced that each of the state’s roughly 550 law-enforcement agencies will be required to complete the program.<br />The program’s creators say it has become a popular initiative with law enforcement in the wake of the protests that erupted across the country after the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis police custody.<br />The NYPD said it plans to certify 125 instructors through the program. The instructors will then provide the training to the department’s 35,000-plus officers, police officials said. NYPD officials said they hope to roll out the initiative departmentwide by the end of 2021.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Government debt around the world shot up last year to approach levels last seen in the aftermath of World War II, as nations stepped up spending to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic fallout, the International Monetary Fund said Thursday.<br />Public debt as a share of global gross domestic product surged to 98% by the end of December from 84% at the end of 2019, before the pandemic struck, the IMF said in an update to its semiannual Fiscal Monitor report. The IMF is the global lender of last resort to countries in distress and tracks debt levels closely. The total dollar value of global debt, which includes central and state government debt, came to $89.6 trillion at year’s end.<br />The increase was particularly large among advanced economies, which can easily borrow at low interest rates. The debt-to-GDP ratio among those nations rose to 123% by December from 105% in 2019, and it is expected to grow to 125% this year.<br />“From 2021 onwards, debt stabilizes at a high level and stays elevated well above the pre-Covid-19 level up to the end of” 2021, said Vitor Gaspar, director of the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department.<br />The IMF said governments should emphasize measures to combat the pandemic and cautioned against prematurely dialing back on spending.</td>

Smaller ones at convenience stores often have up to $20,000. During last spring’s pandemic lockdown, ATMs that normally held $50,000 might have contained $100,000, said 3SI Marketing Director Lisa Moughan, because banks and credit unions urged customers to use the machines for withdrawals when many branches temporarily closed.</td>

That transparency could make it easier for regulators to levy claims of manipulation, which historically has been a difficult offense for regulators to prove.<br />“If they are all egging each other on using a social-media platform, they are effectively engaged in a crowdsourced pump-and-dump scheme,” said Daniel Hawke, a partner at Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP.<br />The traders “are making no effort to conceal their apparent intent to manipulate the price of the stock,” added Mr. Hawke, a former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s market abuse unit.<br />The two-week rally in shares of GameStop, once one of the most heavily shorted stocks, has captivated the stock market.

France is falling behind the rest of Europe in reducing emissions, and Mr. Macron hasn’t settled on a strategy to meet the country’s pledges under the Paris accord.<br />Mr. Macron created an assembly of everyday citizens to come up with a sweeping plan to place France on a trajectory to become carbon neutral by 2050. But the assembly’s plan—which ranges from curbs on domestic flights to taxes on SUV sales—has now run into opposition from Mr. Macron himself.<br />“We need to make some adjustments,” said a close presidential aide, adding that some of the proposals were unacceptable to the public. Mr. Macron recently told the youth-focused news website Brut that the government needed to study the proposals’ economic impact, adding that it wasn’t up to the assembly to “anticipate everything, think of everything.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden plans to end a policy that prohibits federal funds from going to foreign-aid groups that perform abortions or provide related services, one of several moves likely to spark renewed debate over abortion access.<br />Mr. Biden can make some of his intended changes quickly, but others will likely run into hurdles in Congress, where Democrats hold narrow majorities. Echoing many Democrats and abortion-rights advocates, he has said he backs ending a provision in spending bills known as the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funds from being used for abortions except in limited cases. But many Republicans say they will oppose any spending bill that doesn’t include the amendment.<br />The White House said Mr. Biden on Thursday will issue a “Presidential Memorandum to protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health care,” as part of a series of health care-related actions. Among its effects will be to reverse a rule known as the “Mexico City policy”—or, to critics, the “global gag rule.” The policy bars foreign nongovernmental groups that get U.S. funding from providing abortions or abortion information. Recent Democratic administrations have ended the policy, and Republican administrations have reinstated it.<br />The memorandum will also direct the Department of Health and Human Services to consider rescinding regulations under the federal Title X family-planning program. The Trump administration implemented one that cut off federal funding for organizations such as Planned Parenthood Federation of America.<br />“It is a good down payment, absolutely,” Ilyse Hogue, president of Naral Pro-Choice America, said of Mr. Biden’s anticipated early moves, adding that advocates of wider abortion access know the hurdles facing a repeal of the Hyde Amendment.</td>

Staple menu items sold by the burger company boosted U.S. sales, McDonald’s said.<br />But tightened restrictions on businesses and indoor dining, particularly in Western Europe, dragged on business abroad, McDonald’s said. Fourth-quarter sales at international restaurants that McDonald’s runs were down 7.4% from a year earlier, improving on the previous quarter’s 10.1% decline.<br />But overall, McDonald’s said costs related to the pandemic, including spending on safety equipment and marketing, ate into profit during its latest period. The company reported earnings, adjusted for one-time items, of $1.70 a share for the quarter, missing analysts’ expectations of $1.77 a share. Revenue of $5.3 billion for the quarter also came in slightly below projections.<br />A surge in Covid-19 cases depressed sales across many consumer sectors late last year.

Diageo said sales in its largest market were also buoyed by a continuing shift among drinkers from beer and wine to spirits, and by a rush from distributors to restock.<br />Net spirits sales in the U.S. grew 15% in the last six months of 2020 on an organic basis, which strips out currency movements, driven by an 80% jump in tequila net sales as Don Julio and Casamigos were embraced by drinkers staying in. Tequila now accounts for 7% of Diageo’s global net sales, up from 1% five years ago.<br />Diageo said consumers in the U.S.—following the early days of lockdown when they stocked up on large bottles of booze—have been reaching for pricier liquor as they look to replicate a bar experience at home.<br />The company reported a 12% rise in U.S. sales for Baileys, which Chief Executive Ivan Menezes said reflected the company’s efforts to market the drink as a year-round treat rather than just a winter dessert liquor. It pushed the brand as a baking ingredient for banana bread during lockdown and launched a seasonal apple pie variant to cater to the home baking trend.</td>

That would make it subject to higher capital requirements and probably dramatically slower growth.<br />What is happening is emblematic of two trends. The first is Beijing’s desire to get a tighter grip on China’s booming online financial services industry.<br />Ant has had a revolutionary impact on Chinese consumer finance—creating what was at one point the largest money-market fund in the world—helping expand access to loans for small borrowers. That’s not without drawbacks, however, including serious financial stability concerns. Ant’s capital-light model of originating loans for banks for a fee without taking on much risk itself created a clear potential for abuse.<br />But the second trend is a political culture that can’t brook alternative centers of influence.</td>

Her research on labor markets, education and discrimination fits squarely with President Biden’s priorities of rebuilding a labor market that has lost nearly 10 million jobs during the pandemic and addressing racial and income disparities.<br />“It’s an excellent nomination,” said Greg Mankiw, who chaired the CEA under President George W. Bush and taught at Harvard when Ms. Rouse was working on her economics doctorate there. “I’m not expecting to agree with her on everything, but given what President Biden was looking for, he hit a home run with Ceci.”<br />Ms. Rouse, 57 years old, served as one of three members of the CEA during the first two years of the Obama administration and on President Bill Clinton’s National Economic Council in 1998 and 1999.

The boom, however, now seems to be losing momentum. Operating profit last quarter dropped 27% from the previous quarter on a strong won and declining memory prices. The company expects profit to weaken this quarter.<br />The company has been building up dry powder: Net cash at the end of 2020 stood at 104.5 trillion won, equivalent to $93.4 billion, a 61% rise from 2017. Samsung announced a special dividend Thursday as well as raising its regular dividend in the next three years.<br />Samsung should also try to put some of that cash into growth. And the company has hinted that it could soon do exactly that. During the earnings call Thursday, it said it is optimistic about meaningful mergers and acquisitions in the coming three years.<br />Samsung hasn’t made a major acquisition since 2017. Acquiring a non-memory semiconductor or communications technology could help the company diversify away from the notoriously cyclical memory-chip business.

Some policies are already enmeshed in legal proceedings, which means the Biden administration in some cases would need to move swiftly to take action before court decisions are made.<br />States are likely to fight to preserve other Trump administration changes, such as a first-ever block grant in Tennessee that would cap federal funding for the state’s Medicaid program.<br />Mr. Biden is likely to stop short in the executive orders of calling for the policies and waivers to be gutted. The orders are expected to call for federal agencies to re-examine rules and policies that limit access to health care, including demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. Agencies will then consider whether to take additional action.</td>

      <td>Developing economies borrowed at a blistering pace at the start of the year after a record 2020, prompting questions among investors about whether they are building up debt problems for the future.<br />Governments and companies in developing countries have sold close to $100 billion of bonds so far in January, using the cash to plug budget deficits and shield themselves from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from Dealogic. In all of 2020, they borrowed $847 billion.<br />“We’ve never seen a busier start, in terms of issuance year to date—by a large margin,” said Stefan Weiler, a regional head of emerging-debt capital markets at JPMorgan. “From an issuer perspective, it’s hard to see market conditions improving.”<br />Benin, a small, rural West African nation that relies on cotton for most of its export income, raised €1 billion this month, equivalent to $1.2 billion, at an average yield of 5.4%, which was over half a percentage point lower than for a similar, smaller issuance in 2019.<br />The country was able to “seize the best market window available,” said Romuald Wadagni, Benin’s minister of economy and finance. He said more than 125 international investors bid for the bonds and noted that the 31-year bonds had the longest maturity of euro-denominated debt ever issued by an African country.</td>

He said it remains to be seen whether Mr. Sheikh would remain in prison in the meantime.<br />The U.S. government has said it is willing to intervene in the case, but it isn’t clear how it could do so. Behind the scenes, U.S. officials say they have been pressing Pakistani authorities to keep Mr. Sheikh in prison.

Beyond the pandemic, the company is contending with its de facto leader Lee Jae-yong being back behind bars. And its rivals, for handsets and semiconductors, are consolidating and getting larger.<br />Samsung posted 6.61 trillion South Korean won, or nearly $6 billion, in net profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31, over last year’s 5.23 trillion won. Revenue rose to 61.55 trillion won from the prior year’s 59.88 trillion won.<br />Analysts had forecast about 6.74 trillion won in net profit and 61.21 trillion won in revenue, according to estimates from S&P Global Market Intelligence.<br />Like other technology companies, Samsung has fared well in the pandemic on the strength of demand for most consumer electronics and displays, though economic pressures squeezed smartphone sales in the first half of last year. The company is closely watched in the technology world, as a major manufacturer of appliances and computing devices as well as a critical supplier to other electronics firms.</td>

      <td>Disappointing fourth-quarter earnings highlight the reality that Elon Musk’s car company will struggle to justify its valuation</td>
      <td>The furious rally in so-called Reddit stocks has captivated Wall Street and the general public. While the attention is elsewhere, a much more familiar mania is still worthy of investor scrutiny.<br />Tesla Inc.  reported fourth quarter sales of $10.7 billion and earnings of 24 cents a share on Wednesday, its fifth straight quarter of profits, according to generally accepted accounting principles. The car company also said it would increase production by at least 50% in 2021 from last year, when it delivered nearly half a million vehicles. Shares sold off after hours, but faithful Tesla shareholders barely felt a scratch: Buying the stock in May 2019 and holding on to it would have earned more than 22 times the initial investment.<br />That fact should alarm shareholders as much as it delights them: Tesla is sporting a market cap of $800 billion, which is more than seven times the combined sum of  Ford  and  General Motors .  That valuation is paired with a minuscule share of the global auto market. Faith in Chief Executive Elon Musk to work magic evidently goes a long way.<br />Granted, Tesla vehicles have proven to be enormously popular with Mr. Musk’s devoted fan base, and competition from established auto makers has been slow to roll out. Yet to assume ever-growing market share in perpetuity would be a mistake. Tesla had about 13% of total electric car market share in Western Europe last year, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. That lagged behind  Volkswagen  by about 10 percentage points.<br />Competitive concerns aside, the stock changed hands at 1,371 times trailing earnings as of Wednesday. Even that cartoonishly large multiple provides false comfort: In the fourth quarter, Tesla earned $270 million in net income but sold $401 million in regulatory credits to other auto makers needing to meet emissions mandates, primarily in Europe. Before tax, those revenues carry 100% profit margins. Tesla’s credit sales have significantly outpaced net income for five consecutive quarters, and those credits might become less valuable over time, as more manufacturers step up electric car production.</td>

      <td>American Financial Group Inc.  on Wednesday said it agreed to sell its annuity business to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. in a $3.5 billion cash deal.<br />The acquisition will deliver new ways for the giant Springfield, Mass., company, one of the nation’s oldest life insurers, to sell its products. MassMutual has long had one of the biggest fleets of career agents in the U.S., and the deal will add opportunities to sell through banks, independent broker dealers and independent agents, analysts said.<br />American Financial said the transaction will mark its exit from the market for fixed and indexed annuities, which are popular retirement products with conservative savers. It will focus more tightly on its property-and-casualty insurance operations.<br />The Cincinnati-based insurer is the latest U.S. insurer to divest annuity operations, as ultralow interest rates pressure companies’ abilities to earn healthy profits on the product line.<br />The transaction is the third life-insurance-industry transaction in a week and one of many over a decade of frenzied industrywide activity, as insurers have been narrowing their focus and divesting product lines, much of it motivated by the low interest-rate environment. Insurers invest customers’ premiums until needed to pay claims, so low rates make many products challenging to profitably sell.</td>

      <td>Tech stocks’ gyrations and several looming challenges left the social network’s investors unimpressed with a strong quarter and encouraging near-term trends.</td>
      <td>Investors who could pry themselves away from Reddit on Wednesday afternoon found  Facebook  much more soothing—the company’s results, that is.<br />The social-media giant reported monster fourth-quarter results. Total revenue grew by 33% year-over-year—well above Wall Street’s estimate—driven by advertising revenue growth of 31%. Given easy comparables as a result of the pandemic, the company said that it expects year-over-year growth rates to remain stable or to accelerate modestly in the first half of 2021. They will appear less flattering, however, in the second half of the year—a time when the company says it also could face pressure from ad targeting and regulatory headwinds.<br />Facebook has lagged behind the Nasdaq Composite Index and social-media competitors  Twitter ,   Snap Inc.  and Pinterest over the last year as such risks loomed. But the company should find relative shelter in its diversity. Analysts are expecting daily active users on the platform to continue to grow sequentially in the first quarter, alleviating some investors’ concerns of attrition following the platform’s January suspension of former President Donald Trump. That makes sense: Analysts forecast the U.S. and Canada will account for only about 10% of Facebook’s daily active users world-wide in the first quarter, according to Visible Alpha. Advertisers should continue to find superior value in Facebook’s platform relative to competitors.<br />Investors also have worried for months now about the revenue impact of  Apple ’s  impending iOS update, which will hamper advertisers’ ability to track users’ data in order to market themselves and monetize their ads on Facebook’s platform. But  Morgan Stanley ’s  Brian Nowak argues that Facebook’s breadth and differentiation will soften the blow. He estimates the iOS change would amount to just a 1% to 3% revenue loss in 2021 for Facebook, and he also notes that all platforms affected by Apple’s update will see their advertisers’ return on investment take a hit. Facebook, in other words, isn’t alone. Yet another concern is possible antitrust suits from regulators, but here Facebook also has company, and such suits can take years to play out.<br />Meanwhile, the fundamentals look promising: Truist’s Youssef Squali says Facebook’s more-than-8-million advertisers will help it “absorb some of the shock from negative externalities” such as the pandemic, future ad boycotts and regulatory and platform changes. Wall Street is expecting Facebook to grow ad revenue at an average pace of more than 29% year-over-year in the first and second quarter, according to FactSet, leaving room for upside based on the company’s guidance.</td>

The casino magnate died Jan. 11 from complications of treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 87. The company began when Mr. Adelson and partners bought the old Sands Hotel casino on the Las Vegas Strip in 1989.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic has roiled the casino industry with temporary shutdowns, reduced travel and limited occupancies under social-distancing.

Justice Department officials said the charge may be the first of its kind.<br />Douglass Mackey—whose alleged alias, Ricky Vaughn, was behind a highly trafficked alt-right Twitter account—is accused in a federal complaint in Brooklyn of working with others to design and distribute tweets telling people they could vote by texting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s name to a telephone code. Around Election Day 2016, at least 4,900 unique phone numbers texted Mrs. Clinton’s name or some derivative to a number provided by the alleged misinformation campaign, prosecutors said.<br />The criminal complaint charges Mr. Mackey with one count: conspiring to deprive people of their right to vote. Department of Justice officials described the charge as unusual, and a department spokesman said Mr. Mackey may be the first defendant to be charged with election-interference crimes stemming from social-media posts.<br />The complaint doesn’t identify Mrs. Clinton by name, referring to her instead as “the Candidate,” but a person familiar with the investigation confirmed it referred to the former senator and secretary of state.<br />Mr. Mackey, 31 years old, was arrested in Palm Beach on Wednesday and was released on $50,000 bond after an appearance in federal court in Florida.

      <td>Job losses in 2020 were far higher in states that loved lockdowns.</td>
      <td>Recall the political panic after the Labor Department reported 140,000 job losses in December? Well, the government’s state employment report released Tuesday shows those losses were largely related to state lockdowns, and jobs are rebounding rapidly in less restrictive states.<br />Despite the virus surge, employment increased in 15 states last month including Texas (64,200), Georgia (44,700), North Carolina (33,600), Wisconsin (15,100) and South Carolina (14,600). But these gains were more than offset by losses in Michigan (-64,400), California (-52,200), Minnesota (-49,800), Pennsylvania (-37,600) and New York (-37,200).<br />Democratic governors of the latter states shut down indoor dining (and outdoors in California), so not surprisingly nearly all of their job losses were in leisure and hospitality. Yet most states added jobs across industries, especially trade and transportation, and some including Georgia and Texas even added thousands in leisure and hospitality.<br />This underlines that the economy and jobs were recovering in most states before Congress passed its $900 billion relief bill and Joe Biden became President. The states that are struggling most imposed excessive business shutdowns, which didn’t control the virus any better than states that allowed business to operate with social distancing.<br />Note the nearby table that shows 10 states with the largest employment declines from December 2019 to December 2020: Hawaii (-13.8%) has suffered from unique tourism losses, but how do you explain Michigan (-10.9%), New York (-10.4%), Massachusetts (-9.1%) and the others if not by the degree of their lockdowns? Most lost jobs were in leisure and hospitality, as well as health care, education and manufacturing.</td>

      <td>President Biden wants to give states $130 billion more in Covid relief, but he may need more after Wednesday. The oil and gas lease moratorium on federal lands that he announced will erase thousands of blue-collar jobs—and billions of dollars in revenue that states use to fund education.<br />The feds split mineral royalties with the states, many of which rely on the revenue to balance their budgets. Some states also impose general receipts taxes on oil and gas production. Wyoming state superintendent Jillian Balow notes that her state depends on some $150 million a year in oil and gas federal royalties to fund K-12 schools.<br />A University of Wyoming study last month estimated that a federal leasing moratorium could cost states on average $1.6 billion annually in tax revenue. New Mexico ($946 million), Wyoming ($304 million), and North Dakota ($136 million) would be hit hardest, though Colorado, Alaska, Utah and Montana would also lose tens of millions of dollars.<br />Because state, private and federal lands are interspersed in a checkerboard pattern, as the study notes, Mr. Biden’s ban will effectively limit production on much private and state land too. Job losses will also reduce income and sales tax revenues.<br />Notably, Mr. Biden’s order exempts Native American tribal lands and says “The Secretary of the Interior shall engage with Tribal authorities regarding the development and management of renewable and conventional energy resources on Tribal lands.” States also have sovereign rights under the Constitution. Why isn’t the Administration engaging with them?</td>

      <td>Record-breaking quarter comes as stock has already reached a record high valuation</td>
      <td>$100 billion should feel better than this.<br />Apple Inc.  crossed that milestone by generating $111.4 billion in revenue during its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 26. That is not only a record for the tech giant, it was nearly 8% above Wall Street’s targets and represented a gain of 21% from the same period last year—Apple’s best growth rate in more than five years.<br />That growth can be credited to strength across the company’s product segments with the latest iPhone updates leading the way. Revenue for the smartphone line rose 17% from a year earlier to a record-high $65.5 billion. Service revenue jumped 24%, a notable acceleration from the midteens growth seen in the last several periods. And despite launching new iPhone designs packed with expensive 5G radio chips, Apple’s bottom line exploded. Operating income jumped 31% year over year to $33.5 billion, producing an operating margin above 30% for the first time since late 2015.<br />A stellar quarter, in other words, especially against the backdrop of a global pandemic that worsened significantly during the quarter. But investors seemed unimpressed: Apple’s share price slipped nearly 3% in after-hours trading following the results and conference call—one in which Apple continued to refrain from giving a forecast for the current quarter, citing continued uncertainty created by the continuing pandemic.<br />Part of the tepid reaction may be because of dynamics beyond Apple’s control, such as a newfound love among retail investors for beaten down names.  BlackBerry ,  the once-mighty smartphone maker that was nearly vanquished by the first iPhones, has seen its share price more than double in the past week. But Apple’s been a hot stock in its own right, with its shares surging 84% over the past 12 months. That has put them at a record-high multiple of around 35 times forward earnings. And the passing of the holiday quarter and iPhone launch naturally brings questions about what Apple might do next—an area the company is always  to discuss. So investors just have the most recent quarter to act on, and that blockbuster was already well priced in.</td>

So I would suggest that they explore looking at climate as an emergency, which would give them more flexibility.”<br />By “flexibility,” Mr. Schumer means unilateral power to redirect federal funds for climate projects and subsidies, block oil exports, suspend drilling projects and perhaps stop the transport of all fossil fuels. All of this would be illegal in our view without explicit Congressional approval, and would be challenged in court, but the “emergency” strategy has been emerging on the left for some time.<br />We warned Republicans that Democrats would cite Mr. Trump’s use of emergency powers as a precedent for their policies. And now here we are.</td>

      <td>Amid little GOP support for a conviction, Collins and Kaine seek support for formal condemnation of  former president’s actions</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON -- Two senators from opposite sides of the aisle were working Wednesday to build support for censuring former President Donald Trump over his rhetoric ahead of the Capitol riot as an alternative to proceeding to an impeachment trial likely to result in his acquittal.<br />The push from Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) and Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.) comes a day after just five Republicans sided with Democrats in a vote testing lawmakers’ stances on whether the trial was constitutional. The trial is set to begin in earnest in February, and Democrats would need support from at least 17 Republicans to convict Mr. Trump.<br />Tuesday’s vote showed it is “extremely unlikely that President Trump would be convicted,” Ms. Collins said. “It seems to me that there is some value in looking at an alternative to proceeding with the trial.” Ms. Collins was one of the handful of senators to side with Democrats in the vote.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) rejected the suggestion that the Senate should set aside the trial and said Wednesday that the Senate would proceed as planned. “Make no mistake—there will be a trial, and the evidence against the former president will be presented in living color,” he said. He said the constitutional objections to the trial were an attempt by Republicans to avoid having to cast judgment on Mr. Trump’s actions.<br />Mr. Trump’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</td>

      <td>The new president’s actions don’t suggest he’s interested in bipartisan progress.</td>
      <td>If America were diabetic, it would be suffering from hyperglycemia after the sugary coverage of President Biden’s first week.<br />Much praise was heaped on the new administration in opinion commentary and what passes for straight journalism nowadays. Mr. Biden was celebrated for beginning the “healing,” punching plenty of “reset buttons” and extending a much-needed “olive branch.”<br />His inaugural address was “grand and deeply intimate,” a “balm for a wounded nation.” Mr. Biden “met the challenge” simply by appearing at his swearing-in “at a moment of profound national vulnerability.” One veteran observer admitted it left him “in a bit of a swoon.” I’m sure it did.<br />It’s understandable that so many in the media hailed Mr. Biden’s ascension to the Oval Office. They loathed the person he replaced. But looking beyond the paeans, the new president is off to a soggy start, with too many discrepancies between declared intentions and subsequent actions.<br />Mr. Biden frequently calls for bipartisanship, but that will require his leadership. He will have to work with Republican leaders to find areas of agreement before surfacing legislation. On Covid-19 stimulus, the president did nothing of the sort. Instead, he laid out his initiative without consulting Republicans and included several provisions and a $1.9 trillion price tag he knew were unacceptable to GOP lawmakers. Now, rather than quickly passing a bipartisan bill that strengthens vaccinations and gives the new administration an early victory, we hear talk of Democrats ramming Covid relief through on a party-line vote using the reconciliation procedure.</td>

      <td>The losses from finding new servers will be dwarfed by the gains from all the free publicity.</td>
      <td>The coordinated actions of Big Tech against Parler, a free-speech competitor to  Twitter ,  have attracted much attention and debate. Some argue that deplatforming Parler was necessary to stop further violence after the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Others see political discrimination at work, given that  Facebook ,  YouTube and Twitter also host bad actors. Everyone seems to agree that the actions by Big Tech caused great harm to Parler.<br />On the contrary, there are strong economic reasons to think Parler will benefit in the long run. The value of the free publicity will ultimately far outweigh the loss of revenue from being shut down for a few weeks. Parler has become a household name. It was a company; now it’s a cause.<br />The attack on Parler follows a long history of incumbent monopolies trying to raise costs on new rivals. Once Parler gets new servers up, however, using a phone to sign up or log on through a browser rather than an app is a small barrier to entry. Many highly profitable websites have no apps.<br />The benefits to Parler from Big Tech’s actions come in the long haul. The value of any company stems from the present value of its future earnings. An investment raises this present value when the up-front cost is dwarfed by the gains in future earnings. Big Tech has made an implicit investment in Parler by imposing a short-run cost that is smaller than the more lasting future gain in earnings enabled by the free marketing campaign.<br />The growth in future users doesn’t have to be large to raise the value of Parler. It seems safe to assume that the number of users will be larger in March this year than it would have been without the Big Tech effort. And the growth doesn’t have to be huge to make a big difference. Losing 100% of a month’s earnings to switch servers is easily made up by a long-run gain of a few percentage points of monthly users afterward. Such a small gain seems more than likely given the multiples of 100% growth in Parler users after Twitter’s suppression of stories about Hunter Biden’s business dealings.</td>

He will provide guidance on an interim basis to Sam Dolnick, who oversees the paper’s audio unit as well as its film and television projects, and executive audio producer Lisa Tobin.<br />Mr. Levy said in an interview that “bringing newsroom sensibilities” to the audio group is part of the reason for his new assignment. Addressing the problems related to the “Caliphate” series, which caused the Times to issue a major correction in December, “is one part,” he said.<br />The Times has made audio a focus in its digital expansion efforts, as podcasts grow in popularity with listeners and advertisers. U.S. ad spending on podcasts was up 14.7% in 2020 to nearly $1 billion, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.<br />The Times’s flagship podcast, “The Daily,” is regularly among the most-downloaded podcasts. The publisher doesn’t break out its audio unit’s financial results. The unit generated about $29 million in revenue in 2019, a person familiar with the matter said, about 11% of overall digital ad revenue that year. The revenue figure was earlier reported by Business Insider.</td>

We offer them in light of Katie Couric’s swipe at Trump supporters. “The question,” she told Bill Maher, “is how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump.” The Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson reckons the number of Americans who need to be deprogrammed is in the “millions.” . . .<br />Step 1. Disconnecting the Republican solenoid. This device was installed after the Civil War by the Sun’s new proprietor, Charles Dana. Before the war, Dana had been fired from the Tribune by that jackanapes Horace Greeley, who’d endorsed Southern secession, to which Dana’d objected. Whereupon Dana got hired by Abe Lincoln to cover the war for one reader — the president. . . .<br />Step 2. Lifting out the gold core. This system of measuring value was installed in the 19th century, when William Jennings Bryan ran for president on a platform of inflation. . . . The Sun sided with gold.</td>

      <td>In the face of extinctions, a writer’s call to cherish the voices that make a symphony out of the natural world.</td>
      <td>For half a century, philosopher Kathleen Dean Moore has written about the natural world, her work shaped by the homes she’s made in Corvallis, Ore., and Chichaghof Island, Alaska. It’s also indebted to the conservationist and writer Rachel Carson (1907-1964), best known for “Silent Spring,” the landmark 1962 book in which she envisioned a world eerily hushed by pesticides. “I imagine,” Ms. Moore writes of Carson, “she called the book ‘Silent Spring’ . . . because it was the loss of the birds’ music that would grieve her the most.”<br />Ms. Moore adores birdsong, too, though in “Earth’s Wild Music: Celebrating and Defending the Songs of the Natural World” she details the threat of a broader quiet across the planet if humanity fails to heed warnings about the extinction crisis and other environmental challenges before us. “In the fifty years that I have been writing about nature,” she laments, “roughly 60 percent of all individual mammals have been erased from the face of the Earth. The total population of North American birds, the red-winged blackbirds and robins, has been cut by a third. Half of grassland birds have been lost. Butterflies and moths have declined by similar percentages. As individual numbers decrease, species are being lost, too. As many as one out of five species of organisms may be on the verge of extinction now, and twice that number could be lost by the end of the century.”<br />Given its subject matter, “Earth’s Wild Music” is necessarily a serious book, but its moral insights are occasionally leavened with humor. Ms. Moore is a fervent nature lover, sometimes comically so. She finds it grand when a woodpecker rat-a-tat-tats her roof in the wee hours of an Alaskan morning, breaking her sleep, though the author’s sister suggests earplugs. Ms. Moore grieves when a new roof proves less welcoming to the noisy critter and devises largely fruitless expedients to lure him back. She overcomes a fear of caves and enters one in Arizona, and, on a desert campout, she not only accepts the presence of rattlesnakes but goes out looking for them—at night. And while others might be put off by the spines of a saguaro cactus, Ms. Moore thrums them like a guitar. “If a person is patient in her plucking,” she notes, “she can play music” on the prickly plant.<br />The straight man for Ms. Moore’s quixotic adventures is her husband of many years, Frank Moore, a retired neuroendocrinologist whom she affectionately describes as “tall and strong . . . ruddy as a ponderosa pine.” He’s also dying of a cancer working “quietly behind the scenes.” The mere thought of his absence, she mentions in a passage that brings a lump to the reader’s throat, brings what she calls “anticipatory loneliness.”<br />Ms. Moore considers the possibility of an even wider loss—the souring of seas, the withering of forests, and the wholesale disappearance of many kinds of life, which she regards as a form of spiritual impoverishment, too. “My nightmare is that before we lose the Earth’s life-sustaining systems, we will lose its soul-sustaining system—the Earth’s wild music,” she writes.</td>

      <td>Federal Reserve faces a challenge in how it will eventually communicate an exit strategy with the market</td>
      <td>The first rule of tapering is don’t talk about tapering anytime soon.<br />Federal Reserve policy makers probably think the prospects for the economy in 2021 look significantly better than they did when they gathered mid-December. For now, though, the economy is facing the surge in Covid-19 cases that began last fall, along with the related stepped up caution and restrictions. Following their two-day meeting Wednesday, they focused on the downside.<br />They noted in their post-meeting statement that the recovery in the economy and job market has slowed. They again committed to keeping rates near zero until the labor market is tight and inflation has obviously cleared its 2% target rate, and to keep buying $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage bonds per month “until substantial further progress” has been made toward those goals.<br />Yet though the economy has weakened in recent months, economists have been raising their growth forecasts. Following the Fed’s December meeting, for example, economists at  JPMorgan Chase  reckoned that in the fourth-quarter of 2021, gross domestic product would be 3.4% above its year-earlier level. Since then, they have raised that forecast to 5.4%.<br />There are multiple forces driving the improved outlook. First, there is the Covid-19 relief package that was passed late last year. Its extension of jobless benefits, renewed support for small businesses and the direct payments it provided to many Americans assuaged concerns that GDP might actually contract in the first quarter relative to the fourth. Second, with Democrats gaining control of the Senate, another round of fiscal support is looking likely in the months ahead. Throw in expectations that enough people will be vaccinated for life to take on some semblance of normal later this year, and things start looking pretty rosy.</td>

That would be a mistake.<br />Sure, the wildly popular Reddit group Wall Street Bets—slogan: like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal—is full of childish chat. Several users report that they have bet their parents’ pension fund on GameStop or that the boss’s daughter has bought in. There are plenty of calls for the stock to go to $1,000 or more (it started the year at $18.84).<br />But GameStop’s soaring stock—and similar moves in  BlackBerry ,   Nokia  and others—is a bubble in microcosm, with lessons for those of us worrying about froth elsewhere in the market.</td>

      <td>SO MANY DISHES on the menu at Balkan Treat Box come straight from St. Louis’s Bosnian community, the largest outside Europe, said chef Loryn Nalic. Her husband and business partner, Edo Nalic, came to the city as a refugee in his teens. Early in their courtship, this recipe became a touchstone.<br />Ms. Nalic learned to cook the meat-and-potato pie helping to prepare for a community event. A phyllo crust with a filling of potatoes and smoked beef, it traditionally comes with yogurt drizzled on top—and also takes quite a long time to make, Ms. Nalic noted. At Balkan Treat Box doing things traditionally is very much the point, but for those cooking at home the chef has come up with a few short cuts.<br />Jumpstart the process by blanching the potatoes until they’re tender and creamy; meanwhile, sauté the onions and the sausage. For the crust? Frozen phyllo to the rescue. Simply layer sheets of thawed dough in a pan and brush with melted butter. Folded over the savory filling, the pastry bakes until golden and crisp. In addition to that drizzle of yogurt, you can add crumbled feta and some parsley if you really want to make it a feast (however fast).<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

      <td>Perhaps no issue encapsulates the hypocrisy of the far-left agenda than putting the needs of the few—transgender girls—above those of the many—biological girls.</td>
      <td>I applaud Abigail Shrier in her advocacy of girls, especially when it comes to the thorny issue of transgender girls’ participation in sports (“Joe Biden’s First Day Began the End of Girls’ Sports,” op-ed, Jan. 23). Perhaps no issue encapsulates the hypocrisy of the far-left agenda than putting the needs of the few—transgender girls—above those of the many—biological girls. I am hopeful that female athletes will unite in opposition to President Biden’s recent executive order and that prominent female athletes will express their discontent. As Ms. Shrier eloquently writes, so much is at stake for the next generation of girls. As the father of a first-grade daughter, this issue is resonant for me.<br />Jonathan N. Fiskus<br />Riverdale, N.Y.<br /><br />Abigail Shrier cites the example of just two trans athletes competing successfully against natal girls, speculating, without evidence, on the possible repercussions for “scouting and scholarship opportunities and trophies.” This thin argument fails to support the headline’s dire prediction and Ms. Shrier’s contention, with its wily figure shaming, about “a body blow to the rights of women and girls.”</td>

      <td>Canadians have known for decades that in dealing with America, the rules may change midgame or that Americans may disregard the rules entirely if it suits them.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Keystone Pipeline Kill” (Jan. 21): Spare us the concern for Canada’s feelings. Canadians, and particularly those of us from Alberta, have known for years that Keystone was at risk. Significant changes in energy markets, environmental and climate outlook, and political will over the 15 years since Keystone was proposed have painted an increasingly bleak picture for the project. These forces are at play world-wide, including in Canada, where we can’t get a pipeline built across British Columbia for the same reasons. So as disappointing as the Keystone cancellation may be to many, it is hardly a surprise or an insult.<br />Canadians have also known for decades that in dealing with America, the rules may change midgame or that Americans may disregard the rules entirely if it suits them. Softwood lumber comes readily to the mind of most Canadians. Investors know the same thing, so the president’s announcement was neither surprising nor a departure from well-established practice.<br />As far as insults go, the president’s action doesn’t even rank. The gold standard for that might be President Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, on the assertion that those industries constitute a threat to U.S. national security. Canada, a threat to U.S. national security? Now that’s an insult.<br />Brian Ward<br />Thousand Oaks, Calif.</td>

But a train had to stop at a water tower (charging station) when it ran low, sitting there, waiting a long time to be refilled. Civil engineers working for the railroads came up with under-way (without stopping) water replacement. To accomplish this, trenches were built in the railroad bed and filled with water. As the train passed, it sucked up the water without slowing down.<br />Modifying the train, the tracks, the plumbing and the labor required enormous costs paid for by the railroad—not the taxpayer.<br />Ecclesiastes 1:9: Nothing under the sun is new.<br />Thomas Kolber</td>

This week alone there are projects with Denzel Washington and Jared Leto (“The Little Things”) and Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan (“The Dig”). Spotify is also leaning on notable actors to voice audiobooks like Forest Whitaker, Hilary Swank and Cynthia Erivo.<br />Here’s how to stream them:<br />(HBO Max)<br />When John Lee Hancock wrote the script for “The Little Things” in the ‘90s, he envisioned it as a ‘70s movie—complicated characters, lots of questions and not as many answers. He had a deal with Warner Bros. and Steven Spielberg, but Mr. Spielberg ultimately passed on directing it. The story, about a sheriff’s deputy, a detective, and the search for a serial killer, was too dark for Mr. Spielberg to dive into right after “Schindler’s List,” he recalls.<br />Years later, after Mr. Hancock started directing films like “The Rookie” (2002), his producer on “The Little Things” encouraged him to direct the movie himself. But by then Mr. Hancock had young children at home and didn’t want to spend two years in the darkness, either.</td>

Six people were charged in federal court while eight others were charged in state court with aiding the alleged scheme.<br />In the plea agreement, Mr. Garbin, 25 years old, of Hartland, admitted to more than six pages of allegations.

      <td>Today’s researchers have tossed out price theory and don’t realize they’ve been politically compromised.</td>
      <td>William Allen, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of California, Los Angeles died Jan. 15 at 96. Few noted it, but Allen’s death was momentous. It represented a generational shift in the economics profession, one that bodes ill for economists and the public. Allen truly believed in economics—something that is hard to say about most economists these days.<br />Allen was among the last of a generation of economists who were masters of their craft. He wrote, along with his friend and colleague Armen Alchian, an excellent economics textbook that conveys the power and potential of the economic way of thinking: Despite the complexities of markets, economists can get at the heart of how they work by focusing on prices. This insight is so important, it gives economists’ core tool kit a name: price theory. Nobody can be an economist who is unfamiliar with or uncomfortable using this tool kit.<br />Yet by this standard, there are not many economists left. Professional economists are abandoning price theory in droves. The new status quo has upended the field. Economics is increasingly less scientific and more susceptible to political influence.<br />The absence of price theory in today’s economic research would have befuddled the great economists of the past. Contrary to the field’s naysayers, the golden age of 20th-century price theory was never about “neoliberalism” or “market fundamentalism.” Instead, it applied to markets a simple yet brilliant framework that revealed the hidden ways market prices—exchange ratios between goods—facilitated an extraordinary amount of economic coordination. It also showed why many (but not all) restrictions on price adjustments, such as rent controls, resulted in costly and unproductive secondary effects. This was all a part of a broad explanatory project. While individual economists had their policy preferences, the economic way of thinking was above politics.<br />For years, economics has been getting less theoretical and more empirical. Economists are spending less time building and thinking through simple models, and more time collecting and analyzing data. The “identification revolution” in economics raised the payoff, in the form of elite publications, to finding good data from quasiexperimental settings and conducting advanced statistical analyses. Better empirical work should certainly be applauded. But it came at a cost: an entire cohort of economists with serious theoretical blind spots.</td>

      <td>We know what China is doing in Xinjiang. It’s now official. How will woke corporations react?</td>
      <td>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s determination that the People’s Republic of China is engaged in a systematic genocide of the Uighurs was one of the most significant recent developments in U.S. foreign policy. The State Department found that the atrocities have expanded to shocking reproductive coercion: “PRC authorities have conducted forced sterilizations and abortions on Uyghur women, coerced them to marry non-Uyghurs, and separated Uyghur children from their families.”<br />Because the announcement came shortly before President Biden’s inauguration, its far-reaching implications haven’t sunk in. The Trump administration would have done better to issue this finding before the election, but officially invoking the “genocide” label met significant resistance within the government, as it has in past presidencies. Mr. Pompeo deserves credit for pushing it through.<br />The new secretary of state, Antony Blinken, also deserves credit for not making genocide a political issue: He immediately concurred in his predecessor’s determination. It is now America’s official, bipartisan position that China is engaged in “ongoing” genocide—the gravest of all international crimes.<br />Joe Biden was ahead of the curve, accusing China of genocide in August. At the time a Biden spokesman added, “If the Trump administration does indeed choose to call this out for what it is, as Joe Biden already did, the pressing question is what will Donald Trump do to take action.” That question now passes to Mr. Biden.<br />The State Department has made a finding of genocide only six times, two of them in the past quarter-century: regarding Islamic State atrocities against religious minorities in Syria and Iraq (2016) and Sudan’s campaign in Darfur (2011). But ISIS and Sudan weren’t exactly major U.S. trading partners.</td>

      <td>A flurry of executive orders from the Biden administration has resulted in a wider selloff in the energy industry</td>
      <td><br />The Biden administration’s freeze on new federal oil and gas leases is bad news for the U.S. energy industry, but the market reaction has thrown up opportunities, too.<br />Mr. Biden’s first week in office has been a whirlwind of bad news for the sector: Last week, the administration revoked a permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline and placed a temporary ban on federal leasing and permitting for oil and gas. On Wednesday, the administration announced a pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal territory. While the actions resulted in a steep sector selloff, the moves were telegraphed on the campaign trail.<br />Companies with heavier federal lease exposure—including  EOG Resources ,   Devon Energy ,   ConocoPhillips  and  Occidental Petroleum —started underperforming the broader basket of oil and gas exploration companies in the middle of last year as investors weighed Mr. Biden’s campaign promises of stricter limits on federal oil and gas leasing. The threat seemed plausible given the precedent that the Obama administration set in 2016 when it suspended most new leases for coal mining on federal lands. The same companies suffered steeper drops than the sector overall since last week, when the Biden administration announced the temporary moratorium on leasing and permits.<br />The real surprise seems to be that the Biden administration is weighing the possibility of stopping new permits or not allowing permit renewals on federal territory. The order calls for a “rigorous review of all existing leasing and permitting practices”—something the industry hadn’t anticipated. The move is likely to spur heavy legal challenges.</td>

      <td>How cocooning—or wrapping up in swathes of fabulous fabric—can kelp you kick the Covid blues</td>
      <td>WHO NEEDS a hug? If you’ve been missing physical contact while social distancing these past months, you’re not alone—even if you technically are. I’m among the estimated 28% of Americans who live solo, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, but surely I’m not the only one who’s been quarantining in a single-bedroom apartment with two only moderately affectionate pets (rabbits, in my case) and a coldly efficient Peloton.<br />I have my resources, though. When I’m curled up on my couch craving a squeeze, I find solace in my late mother’s big, black, bubble-shaped, wool cocoon coat. Softer than a sweatshirt, this coat can be swooshed and swooped into myriad styles; whenever I wrap it around my shoulders, I’m enveloped in snuggly reassurance. That it ushers high-volume fabulosity into my flat, isolated life doesn’t hurt.<br />And I’m not alone here, either. Cocooning—or shrouding yourself in decadently draped fabric or a bulbous sculptural garment—is trending, perhaps because it swaddles you into calm. “If you live by yourself and you’re not being hugged, [clothes] can replace that sensation,” said Dr. Carolyn Mair, a London behavioral psychologist. “You feel encased, safe and protected, and we’re looking for that now.” Indeed: Pinterest reports that searches for “cocoon sweater” shot up 155% among its 442 million users in the period between fall 2019 and fall 2020, as compared to the same period a year prior. It predicts cocooning will be a key 2021 trend.<br />In line with that, the spring 2021 runways swarmed with consoling chrysalises. Simone Rocha suggested swathing yourself in layers of Grecian-draped taffeta; Loewe’s Jonathan Anderson proposed you wiggle into a marshmallowy white skirt and a woven dome-like top; and Noir Kei Ninomiya presented all-consuming pink orbs embellished with frills or bows.<br />“Fashion is very reactive,” said New York stylist Malina Joseph Gilchrist. “And the cocoon shape offers protection, comfort and a sense of security.” She observed that these imposing silhouettes recall the work of Spanish couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga who, with his scarab-like coats and puffed-up gowns, popularized the cocoon in the mid-20th century. “We’re in a really uncertain time,” she said. “I think that designers always look to the past for reassurance.”</td>

This suggests that investors don’t see Boeing’s disadvantage extending much beyond the grounding of the MAX, the impact of which was baked into the company’s stock price before the outbreak. It is a risky assumption.<br />Fourth-quarter earnings show why the gulf between the companies could in fact get larger—despite a return to service of the MAX, which was cleared to fly by European regulators on Wednesday.<br />The Chicago-based plane maker on Wednesday reported its biggest-ever annual loss. Investors broadly expected it, but were still disappointed by the final tally: Losses for the fourth quarter of 2020 came in at $8.4 billion, compared with analysts’ expectations of about $500 million.<br />This was in part the result of a $6.5 billion pretax charge Boeing took on its 777X wide-body plane program. The company has now pushed its first delivery all the way back to 2023—making it three years late. The 777X has been affected by the pandemic, but also the assumption that regulators will take much longer to certify new jets after the MAX fiasco.</td>

      <td>Online-forum punters have exploited a quirk to push up some unloved stocks. The risk is that investors start believing the share prices imply real-world prospects.</td>
      <td>Wall Street can’t take its eyes off once-unloved stocks such as  GameStop  and  BlackBerry ,  which are rocketing due to a kind of betting game played by online forum users. The real risk is that investors start to believe something deeper is going on.<br />The past year has seen a boom in individuals buying stocks through retail online platforms such as Robinhood. More and more, they seem to be coordinating their moves on sites such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets, placing wagers on firms that are under attack by professional speculators like hedge funds. At Tuesday’s close, GameStop, once a popular target for short sellers, was up almost 3,700% over six months.<br />There are two main causes of big market moves. The healthier one is when new information comes to light about a company, an industry or the economy at large, and financial assets are repriced to reflect it. The other is when market participants buy or sell in a rush, often because they suddenly need to protect their finances—in which case asset prices don’t convey much useful information.<br />The latter is at play now. Hedge funds’ short bets have been unsettled, forcing them to buy back the stocks to limit their losses. Also, punters have been using options contracts to prop up their targets. Such instruments can amplify even small market moves, because they force banks to take the other side and then hedge the risk by buying the actual underlying stocks. It can create a feedback loop: Those stocks then go up, and the value of the options tied to them increases even more, forcing banks to hedge further, and so on.<br />Reddit users haven’t shied away from the technical nature of the price moves, correctly crediting it for their success. But market gyrations caused by bottlenecks in financial plumbing don’t tend to last. The 2018 carnage unleashed by option-driven low-volatility strategies can attest to that. Eventually, there aren’t any forced buyers left. The losses are usually limited in scope.</td>

      <td>Our skin has become a road map of the past year’s lows.</td>
      <td>I feel like I’ve aged six years in six months. These days, it’s a statement often repeated among friends and heard by dermatologists. Can we chalk it up to quarantine exhaustion, or has lockdown actually done something to speed up the aging process on our skin? “I’m hearing more complaints about accelerated aging in my practice than ever before,” says Whitney Bowe, a New York City–based dermatologist and author of The Beauty of Dirty Skin. “It’s very similar to what I used to see when there was a death in the family or a divorce and patients would come in and say, ‘I feel like I aged five years overnight.’ Now we’re seeing that with Covid.”<br />What’s at play may be primarily the effect of chronic stress, which can have a more harmful impact on the skin than shorter periods of acute stress. “Stress drives neurologic and endocrine responses to perceived threats, and prolonged activation of these responses results in abnormalities of the immune system, increased free radicals and subsequent DNA damage, all of which contribute to skin-quality deterioration,” says Robert Anolik, a New York City–based cosmetic dermatologist. The brain responds to perceived danger, he explains, by triggering the fight-or-flight response, leading to adrenaline release and tipping off a surge of other hormones like cortisol, the prolonged effects of which can eventually impact the skin.<br />Long periods of elevated cortisol exposure may be causing many of us to feel that our faces have, quite literally, fallen. “It can actually inhibit your body’s production of hyaluronic acid, collagen and lipids,” says Bowe. “Hyaluronic acid binds a thousand times its weight in water, so it really helps to plump up the skin, and collagen is the triple-helix protein that keeps the skin tight and firm, helping to prevent wrinkles and fine lines.” Finally, lipids, says Bowe, are the healthy fats that bolster the skin’s ability to function as a barrier. When that barrier function is impaired, there’s transepidermal water loss. “Our skin becomes leaky,” Bowe explains, “as water is more likely to evaporate out and allergens, irritants and pollutants are more likely to penetrate in and trigger inflammation.”<br />Inflammation is an issue that New York City aestheticians Carrie Lindsey and Taylor Worden and Boston-based dermatologist Ranella Hirsch all report seeing more of in their respective practices in the past year. Hirsch chalks much of it up to stress and to people overdoing it at home with their skin-care regimens. “Too much free time to experiment with skin care means lots of damaged barriers and inflamed faces,” says Hirsch. “That irritation can quickly age the appearance.” Among Worden’s clients, frequent mask wearing and infrequent mask washing have led to a lot of congested pores along the jawline—now known by the unfortunate term maskne—along with an increase in dermatitis around the mouth. Meanwhile, excess alcohol and caffeine consumption have resulted in dehydration. Because of the cascading exposure to cortisol, and the skin producing less hyaluronic acid and collagen than it naturally would, Bowe’s patients who usually come in for filler every nine months are now returning in five. “The skin is fighting an uphill battle right now,” she says. One other pandemic side effect is a surge in sun damage and melasma. “The lack of regular 9-to-5 office hours and a need to get out of our confined spaces, and because it was the safest place to meet, meant people were outside more than ever before,” says Lindsey.<br />While the pandemic has brought on some very real skin issues, there is also an element that may just be in our head. Hirsch, who dubs the phenomenon the “watched pot,” says, “Never in modern history have so many people had the collective time to stare at their faces up close.” The Zoom factor doesn’t help, either. “It’s impossible to underestimate how much looking at ourselves at less than flattering angles and lighting has impacted our sense of our appearance,” Hirsch says. Though there are a few topical products that one should always use, such as sunscreen and an antioxidant serum to neutralize free radicals, the best treatments for our skin aren’t topical. A healthy diet—antioxidant rich, fruit and vegetable heavy—regular movement, enough sleep, plenty of water, meditative practice such as deep breathing and mental-health support are key for maintaining skin health. It’s a good idea to scale back on the product load. “Hard as it may be to believe, my most fervent hope and the advice I offer daily to my patients is to do less,” says Hirsch. And, most important, be gentle with yourself. “Our skin will recover,” says Lindsey, “and we will begin to look and feel like ourselves again.”</td>

In Zimbabwe’s capital, scores of public-sector health-care workers are falling ill. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, power outages are hobbling the treatment of record numbers of Covid-19 patients in some hospitals.<br />Africa, largely spared the high Covid-19 death toll of the rich world last year, is facing a bigger and more lethal wave of the virus.<br />A new, more transmissible strain of the disease, first detected in South Africa, is driving infections in neighboring countries and has been found thousands of miles away in countries such as Ghana. The continentwide death rate surpassed the global average for the first time in January. From Senegal to Zambia, daily cases have risen to roughly twice the previous peak.<br />“The second wave is here with vengeance and our systems are overwhelmed,” said John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />The new deadlier wave could widen the gap between the world’s richest and poorest nations. Unlike in wealthier countries, African economies can’t afford to repeat last year’s hard lockdowns, which pushed the continent into its worst recession since records began, according to the International Monetary Fund.</td>

Those include rising corporate and government debt levels and declining profitability in some banking systems.</td>

For example, one rule disqualified applicants from asylum if they passed through a third country en route to the U.S. without making a claim in that country.<br />The order would also freeze agreements that the Trump administration signed with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to send asylum seekers to those countries to request protection there instead.<br />Mr. Biden is also expected to rescind a memo that created a program known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, which has forced tens of thousands of asylum seekers arriving at the U.S. southern border to return to Mexico and wait, sometimes for years, as the American court system processes their requests.</td>

      <td>Fintech giant plans to become a financial holding company overseen by China’s central bank</td>
      <td>Ant Group Co. is planning to turn itself into a financial holding company overseen by China’s central bank, responding to pressure to fall fully in line with financial regulations, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Chinese regulators recently told Ant, which is controlled by billionaire Jack Ma, to become a financial holding company in its entirety, subjecting it to more stringent capital requirements, the people said. Ant, in response, has submitted to authorities an outline of a restructuring plan, they said.<br />The plan represents a significant turnaround by a digital-payments juggernaut that has in recent years tried to shed its image as a financial-services provider and fashion itself as an internet-technology company, which helped it command lofty valuations. Before its blockbuster initial public offering was called off in November, Ant had been on track to go public at a valuation north of $300 billion, well above the market capitalizations of the world’s biggest banks.<br />Designating Ant in its entirety as a financial holding company wasn’t something earlier envisioned by the company’s executives and stakeholders. In its listing prospectus last year, Ant said it intended for one of its subsidiaries to become a financial holding company and house its licensed financial businesses such as asset management and consumer lending. Doing this at the group level will subject Ant to a thicket of regulations similar to those that govern banks, and affect its growth and profitability.<br />The restructuring plan, still under deliberation, could be finalized before China goes on a weeklong Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February, people familiar with the matter said.</td>
