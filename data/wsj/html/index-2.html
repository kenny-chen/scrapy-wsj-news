      <td>Cleta Mitchell, a Washington, D.C., attorney who supported President Trump in making claims of election fraud on a weekend call with the Georgia secretary of state, resigned Tuesday from the partnership of a corporate law firm.<br />The firm, Foley & Lardner LLP, said Tuesday that Ms. Mitchell’s resignation was effective immediately and that she “concluded that her departure was in the firm’s best interests, as well as in her own personal best interests.”<br />Ms. Mitchell couldn’t immediately be reached for comment Tuesday. Her husband, Dale Mitchell, said she had been planning to retire in June.<br />“The left wingers are causing her trouble, but they’ve been causing her trouble,” he said. “She’s not exactly losing sleep over this.”<br />Criticism of Ms. Mitchell, known for public-finance work and taking on conservative causes, mounted after she appeared in support of Mr. Trump on the hourlong call with Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Raffensperger to find enough votes to reverse the state’s election results, which showed President-elect Joe Biden won by a margin of 11,779 out of about five million votes cast.</td>

Police also charged him with possession of what they said were two “high-capacity firearm magazines.”<br />The night of the burning, brawls broke out between some demonstrators supporting President Trump and counterprotesters. Several people, including eight police officers, were hurt, authorities said at the time. Four people were stabbed.<br />Mr. Tarrio’s arrest came the same day civil-rights groups filed a lawsuit against Mr. Tarrio and Proud Boys International LLC over vandalism they say the group committed at a second historic Black church in Washington.<br />The far-right group describes itself as a men’s organization for “Western chauvinists” and has often fought with left-wing activists. At pro-Trump rallies in Washington, D.C., after the election, Mr. Tarrio led his group in chants of “F— antifa!”, referring to the loose network of far-left activists who have at times engaged in violence against those they view as fascist or racist.</td>

      <td>Ceremony, originally set to take place on Jan. 31, has been pushed back to March 14</td>
      <td>The Grammy Awards ceremony has been postponed for two months, as concerns surge over the spread of Covid-19, according to the Recording Academy, which hosts the annual music-industry awards show.<br />The ceremony was originally set to take place on Jan. 31 in Los Angeles, with “The Daily Show” host and comedian Trevor Noah as host. Grammy organizers have pushed the event to March 14. The academy’s website earlier Tuesday showed the date had been pushed back to March 21.<br />In late November, the Recording Academy’s interim chief executive and president, Harvey Mason Jr., said there would be live performances at this year’s show but that—given the pandemic—there would be a limited in-person audience, if any audience at all. He also said the Grammys was working with medical experts to ensure artists and fans were safe. “I can definitely tell you there won’t be 17,000 fans there,” he said.<br />But since then, the U.S.—and California and Los Angeles County in particular—has seen a surge in coronavirus cases that gathered strength after Thanksgiving and the December holidays. On Monday, the U.S. reported 180,477 new infections, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. While the figure was down from a day earlier as holiday reporting lags continue to affect data, the seven-day average of new cases—which helps smooth out irregularities in data reporting—has risen above 200,000 again. California is the hardest hit U.S. state, with more than 2.45 million cases, according to Johns Hopkins.<br />“The deteriorating Covid situation in Los Angeles, with hospital services being overwhelmed, ICUs having reached capacity, and new guidance from state and local governments have all led us to conclude that postponing our show was the right thing to do,” the Recording Academy said in a joint statement with CBS, which is broadcasting the event. “Nothing is more important than the health and safety of those in our music community and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly on producing the show.”</td>

      <td>Why do so many Donald Trump voters believe his claim that he won the fall election, despite states declaring that he didn’t and numerous judges rejecting his lawsuits? Perhaps it’s because some Trump conspiracy theories about the nation’s political establishment turned out to be true. The Obama administration really did spy on Mr. Trump’s campaign and media outlets really have been out to get him. Therefore many Trump voters resist acknowledging the duly certified victory of Joe Biden, our President-elect.<br />Thiel Capital’s Eric Weinstein writes on Twitter that almost everyone he knows sees either “two conspiracies against Trump or zero.” He adds:<br />In a separate tweet, Mr. Weinstein writes about the media:<br />Speaking of the media, Mark Finkelstein at NewsBusters writes:<br />CNN’s Fareed Zakaria recently acknowledged “the dirty little secret” that the Trump administration “was pretty tough on the Russians. They armed Ukraine, they armed the Poles. They extended NATO operations and exercises in ways that even the Obama Administration had not done. They maintained the sanctions.”</td>

It instructs Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to evaluate other apps that could pose a national security threat, and calls on the commerce secretary, the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to issue a report with recommendations to prevent the transfer of data from U.S. users to foreign adversaries.<br />Mr. Trump, in the order, said the apps can access private information from their users. That information could be used by the Chinese government to “track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, and build dossiers of personal information,” Mr. Trump said.<br />Alipay, a payment and lifestyle app with more than 1 billion users, is owned by Ant Group, the Chinese financial-technology giant controlled by Mr. Ma.

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Treasury Department has sent out more than $112 billion in stimulus payments electronically, meaning that about two-thirds of the second round of payments approved by Congress is already in households’ bank accounts, according to data released Tuesday.<br />The payments—$600 per adult and $600 per child—were estimated to cost about $164 billion in all. They are part of a broader relief law last month that also includes unemployment insurance and money for small businesses.<br />The pace of payments is faster than in the spring, when the government made the first round of payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child. Then, about half the payments reached bank accounts within two weeks. Now, more than two-thirds of the money has gone out within about one week after President Trump signed the law passed by Congress.<br />In addition to the $112 billion in electronic payments, the government is also mailing checks and prepaid debit cards. It hasn’t said how many payments have been made.<br />“While the IRS has been able to deliver the second round of Economic Impact Payments in record time, we understand there are many questions and we appreciate everyone’s patience during this period,” the agency said in a statement late Tuesday.</td>

      <td>Trump wants to upend the Electoral College. His VP knows better.</td>
      <td>Mike Pence surely understands his constitutional duty. When Congress meets in joint session on Wednesday to count the Electoral College votes, the Vice President’s role is clear: He is to preside honorably, if uncomfortably, over the democratic transfer of power, as 306 electors are tallied for Joe Biden’s victory.<br />President Trump’s  Twitter  feed, no surprise, is telling a different story. “The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors,” he wrote Tuesday. Mr. Trump claims that he’s the victim of a massive electoral conspiracy, yet he can’t find the evidence to convince even conservative judges. Nevertheless, he wants Mr. Pence to throw out Mr. Biden’s electors.<br />This is a triple whammy. It’s false as a matter of fact, because no fraudulent electors exist. It’s false as a matter of law, because the Constitution empowers the Vice President merely to open the Electoral College certificates, not to count them, to say nothing of rejecting any. Finally, it’s a betrayal of the steadfast Mr. Pence that Mr. Trump is trying to discredit him in the eyes of GOP voters. Mr. Trump is showing once again that, to him, loyalty is a one-way street.<br />Some congressional Republicans, including Senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, have said that they also intend to contest the November results under the Electoral Count Act. The law gives them that right, despite its dubious constitutionality. Still, the effort looks as futile as it should be. We’ve already examined their arguments here and won’t rehash them.<br />The good news is that other Republicans are entering the breach to defend federalism and the Constitution. Take Senator Tom Cotton, whose presidential dreams are as high as Mr. Cruz’s. “The Founders entrusted our elections chiefly to the states—not Congress,” Mr. Cotton said Sunday. Overturning Mr. Biden’s win “would essentially end presidential elections.” Any objections Wednesday to duly certified electors, Mr. Cotton added, “will only embolden those Democrats who want to erode further our system of constitutional government.”</td>

      <td>The Saudi-Qatari diplomatic truce is an opportunity for Biden.</td>
      <td>Even in its lame duck period, the Trump Administration isn’t done pushing diplomatic deals in the Mideast. In December Morocco moved to normalize relations with Israel, and now Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain will end their three-and-a-half-year blockade of Qatar. If the Biden Administration is wise, it will capitalize on the greater unity among America’s Middle Eastern allies as a bulwark against Iranian regional mischief.<br />Qatar, an oil-rich nation in the Persian Gulf that hosts a U.S. air base, has been at odds for years with the neighboring monarchies. In June 2017, four Arab countries announced a boycott, halting air travel and disrupting trade. Qatar was hardly a blameless victim in the dispute, having supported the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist causes in Libya and elsewhere. As we wrote at the time, the reckoning may have been needed to send a warning to Doha.<br />But in a new agreement signed in Saudi Arabia, and negotiated by Kuwait as well as Trump Mideast czar Jared Kushner, the blockade of Qatar is largely coming to an end. Flights will resume between the neighboring Arab states, and the countries made expressions of goodwill. Trade and investment can also pick up again.<br />The agreement seems intended to patch deeper ideological fissures between Qatar and the conservative Gulf monarchies, rather than heal them. Doha agreed to drop legal claims against the countries but did not make public commitments to curtail its disruptive behavior. Yet the risk from continued division in the Gulf was that Qatar would drift closer to Turkey and especially Iran, with which it shares a maritime border.<br />Some in the Biden Administration may be eager to punish Saudi Arabia given its human-rights record, but the move shows that Riyadh is making concessions to improve stability in its neighborhood. The Biden team has signaled its eagerness to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, but Tuesday’s agreement shows that the Arab monarchies are drawing closer in part to balance Iran.</td>

      <td>A new limit on floor votes, plus a climate exception to ‘paygo.’</td>
      <td>Speaker Nancy Pelosi knows she has a narrow majority in the new House, and she’s already taking steps to make sure she can still roll over the opposition.<br />Most media attention on the 45 pages of revised House rules for the 117th Congress has focused on the woke provisions. The Democrats banned from the rules document such gendered terms as “father” or “daughter,” in favor of “parent” and “child.” This has rightly earned derision, though not enough. The rules also create a new Select Committee on Economic Disparity and Fairness in Growth, which is best understood as a committee to justify higher taxes and a larger entitlement state. Isn’t that every committee?<br />More important for legislation, however, the rules all but eliminate what is called the motion to recommit. This legislative tool has existed since the first Congress, and for nearly 90 years it has allowed the minority party to offer the last amendment to legislation. The motions typically fail, but they are a way for the minority to highlight and provoke a debate on controversial questions.<br />Last month, for instance, Arizona Republican Debbie Lesko offered a motion to recommit to the Democratic bill legalizing marijuana. Her provision would have guaranteed the right of private companies to test employees or applicants for the drug. Her motion failed, but 11 House Democrats voted with her.<br />With a majority perhaps as small as nine votes, Mrs. Pelosi is clearly worried she could lose such motions. At the demand of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the new rules strip the minority of the ability to use the motions to amend bills. Republicans will only be able to offer motions that send a bill back to committee. This spares swing-district Democrats from difficult votes and reduces Mrs. Pelosi’s chance of defeat on the floor. Even former GOP whip Tom DeLay never imposed that one.</td>

Politicians believed their strict lockdowns and mask mandates would defeat the virus, but they didn’t, and the latest infection surge has exposed deep problems.<br />Hospitalizations in California have increased seven-fold since early November and are nearly three times higher than at the summer peak. California Gov. Gavin Newsom justified reimposing a lockdown in mid-November based on projections that the state’s health-care system would be overwhelmed by virus cases. Yet state and local officials failed to prepare hospitals for the surge that their models predicted.<br />As hospitals burst at the seams last month, the state finally rushed to construct field hospitals in some counties. Yet hospitals in Los Angeles have been forced to convert chapels and gift lobbies into makeshift wards. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers last week was deployed to several LA hospitals to fix aging oxygen pipes that were freezing under pressure.<br />Many hospitals are also short of oxygen tanks for patients to take home so they can free up beds. Patients have waited eight hours in ambulances lined up outside hospitals before being admitted. Ambulance wait times for other emergencies have increased, and “non-essential” care including cancer treatments has been halted.<br />Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn late last week implored Mr. Newsom to bring back the USNS Mercy naval ship to relieve pressure on hospitals. The ship was deployed to the Port of LA during the spring for a surge that didn’t happen and then left.</td>

      <td>There was real evidence of fraud, but the country couldn’t afford a crisis.</td>
      <td>Vice President Richard Nixon was preparing to leave office in January 1961, but he still had several constitutional duties to carry out. On Tuesday, Jan. 3, as president of the Senate, he had the task of convening that body for the meeting of the 87th Congress. Later that week, as spelled out in the 12th Amendment, he presided over a joint session of Congress to “open all the Certificates” and count the Electoral College votes that would declare his rival—Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kennedy—the winner of the 1960 presidential election.<br />The pageantry for the joint session began when two tellers carried the electors’ ballots into the House chamber. Nixon, walking alone wearing a dark suit and a forced smile, followed them to the rostrum where the session was gaveled to order at 12:55 p.m. Nixon began the vote count, which would last for more than an hour. When the tally was complete, Kennedy had received 303 electoral votes, Nixon 219 and Sen. Harry Byrd 15.<br />Before adjourning the joint session, Nixon asked the speaker for “permission” to make a brief statement. He declared that his defeat and his opponent’s victory were an “eloquent example of the stability of our constitutional system and of the proud tradition of the American people of developing, respecting and honoring institutions of self-government.” He congratulated his opponents and declared Kennedy the new president and Lyndon Johnson the new vice president.<br />After the long and tedious count, the chamber erupted with a prolonged ovation. Montana Democratic Sen. Mike Mansfield commented: “What a way to go . . . with dignity and with head held high.” Minnesota Sen. Hubert Humphrey said that the vice president’s remarks would “go down as one of the truly historic messages. It was one filled with humility. It was a gracious and a very thoughtful pronouncement.”<br />It had been one of the closest elections in American history—marked, as we know now, by substantial electoral fraud—but Nixon did not challenge the result. On the contrary, he directed two of his chief aides, campaign manager Robert Finch and campaign press secretary Herbert Klein, to tamp down calls for a recount. He asked the New York Herald Tribune reporter Earl Mazo to stop writing articles on allegations of fraud in Illinois and Texas. He told Attorney General William Rogers not to investigate voting irregularities and telephoned Illinois Gov. William Stratton, a fellow Republican, urging him to certify Kennedy’s triumph in his state.</td>

      <td>This week’s Electoral College challenge is in part the result of tribal media consumption.</td>
      <td>Scores of Republicans in Congress will vote Wednesday to reject the Electoral College results in the 2020 presidential election. This comes despite the rulings from Trump-appointed federal judges in state after state rejecting the president’s assertions that he was cheated, and despite the Supreme Court’s rejection of his frivolous appeals. President Trump leapfrogs among dozens of conspiracy theories, but not a single court—in roughly four dozen attempts—has found sufficient evidence for his claims.<br />Senators know that the president’s social-media rantings are bunk. In our conversations, no one argues that the election was actually stolen. The arguments offered are instead about how Mr. Trump and his core supporters will respond to the certification vote. Republicans are facing tremendous pressure from a vocal minority, and they are wrestling with very real political consequences.<br />In a play, a rifle hanging above the fireplace in the first act must be fired by the third act. At some point Republicans, Democrats or some yet unformed party will fire the gun that Republican election objectors load this week. If voting against the Electoral College is an easy new way to signal disappointment, politicians will make it a quadrennial habit. Basic trust in our elections will evaporate and, down the road, a congressional majority may succeed in changing an outcome.<br />Despite these dangerous innovations in Congress, the deeper problem in our politics is on the demand side. Our central crisis isn’t the existence of political drug dealers. It is that we have a society-wide addiction to clickbait crack that treats politics like blood sport. Fifteen percent to 20% of Americans—our friends and neighbors on the left and right—are hooked.<br />Our politics has become so poisonous that members of Congress now see personal benefit in posturing or actually attempting to overturn a presidential election, thereby disenfranchising millions of Americans for the sin of voting for the other party. Our institutions aren’t meant for this, and the constant horse-race analysis and apocalyptic rhetoric will push us further and faster into idiocracy.</td>

The legislators won elections last month that were boycotted by the opposition and deemed a sham by countries like the U.S., Brazil and neighboring Colombia.<br />The opposition had been in control of the National Assembly since 2015 but saw most of its powers stripped away by authoritarian President Nicolás Maduro in recent years. Among the newly elected assembly lawmakers are Mr. Maduro’s son and wife.<br />“The U.S. firmly rejects the farcical swearing in of the ill-named National Assembly that fake President Maduro is trying to impose,” the U.S. Embassy’s special section on Venezuela, which is based in neighboring Colombia, said in a Twitter post Tuesday.<br />Mr. Maduro now controls all formal levers of power, including the security services, as he tightens his grip on a country where the economy has collapsed in recent years, prompting millions of Venezuelans to flee.</td>

      <td>Democratic speech police demand not only tolerance but endorsement of the progressive agenda.</td>
      <td>In his 1946 essay, “Politics and the English Language,” George Orwell wrote that political language “consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.” The description fits Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s new House rules on gender-neutral speech to a tee.<br />On Monday, the Democratic-controlled lower chamber voted along party lines to approve new official language guidelines. Words such as “himself” and “herself” are to be replaced by “themself.” Out with “father,” “mother,” “son,” “daughter,” “brother,” “sister,” “uncle,” “aunt” and other familial terms, and in with “parent,” “child,” “sibling” and so forth. An incensed Kevin McCarthy, the Republican minority leader, tweeted that the changes “are stupid,” which is true but incomplete.<br />Mrs. Pelosi is obviously attempting to placate the progressives in her caucus, however it’s also another example of how the political left today demands not only tolerance but endorsement. You can’t disagree respectfully, let alone agree not to agree. It’s bad enough when our colleges and universities enforce what amount to speech codes, or indulge efforts to shield students from dissenting viewpoints. Now we have lawmakers in Washington offering a kind of a federal imprimatur on limiting free expression.<br />The next time Republicans control the House, they can and should reverse these changes. There’s little evidence that anyone besides far-left elites is obsessed with a gender-neutral vocabulary. In recent years, Democratic activists have tried to popularize the word “Latinx” in lieu of Latino and Latina. But a Pew Research Center poll taken last year found that just 3% of Hispanics self-describe as Latinx.<br />Nevertheless, what the left is attempting to do here goes well beyond semantic tinkering. The goal is not simply to tell us what we can or can’t say aloud, but to redefine common words and expressions to advance a political agenda. Hence, discussions of “racial diversity” somehow omit Asian-Americans. And blacks are to be identified by their race—with an uppercase “B,” no less—when they are victims of police shootings but not when they are criminal suspects.</td>

      <td>The meritocratic ideal makes elites arrogant and threatens communal solidarity. Identity-based policies make the problem worse.</td>
      <td>For the past decade, and especially since the election of Donald Trump, liberal writers have begun to rethink the left’s decades-long infatuation with individual autonomy and the attendant loss of solidarity in American life. Three or four decades ago, they couldn’t stop ridiculing 1950s America for its supposed dullness and “conformity.” But lately it has occurred to many of them that a society bereft of shared ideals isn’t the happy place they once assumed it would be.<br />These liberals typically don’t assign blame for the breakup of American life to themselves and their forerunners on the political left. They aren’t prepared to trace the invidious phenomenon known as identity politics back to the cultural revolution of the 1960s, and they express little regret for the left’s hostility to religion and contempt for tradition. Instead they pin the blame for American culture’s breakup on various forms of market deregulation. The free-enterprise policies of the 1980s and ’90s, they argue, legitimated greed, widened inequality and encouraged Americans to forget their collective identity.<br />Michael Sandel is a man of the left and accordingly takes a disapproving view of the economic liberalization carried out under Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, but Mr. Sandel has worried about the loss of solidarity in American life for far longer than have most of his political allies. His first book, “Liberalism and the Limits of Justice” (1982), criticized the influential philosopher John Rawls for positing an atomized and thus unrealistic conception of the individual. The essays collected in “Public Philosophy” (2005) likewise scolded the author’s fellow liberals for paying insufficient attention to communal values.<br />In “The Tyranny of Merit: What’s Become of the Common Good?” Mr. Sandel, a professor of political philosophy at Harvard, casts a critical eye on the ideal of meritocracy. The meritocratic model, he believes, has become the de facto creed of both the center-left and the center-right in America. Hence the commonplace, intoned by politicians of both parties, that those who “play by the rules” should be able to “rise as far as their talent and hard work will take them.”<br />Everybody can sympathize with the sentiment behind that thought, but there are two major problems with it, in Mr. Sandel’s view. The first is that it’s an aspiration, an ideal, that Americans increasingly take to be a reality when it isn’t. A young person may be intellectually gifted and possess an excellent work ethic, but if he comes from a low-income home he won’t have the advantages enjoyed by a slightly dumber and lazier student from a privileged background.</td>

Many voters still think the November election was unfair, he said.<br />He could have added that saying an election was unfair is tantamount to saying an election was held. Elections are unfair. Unfairness is part of the fitness test. Campaigns lie about each other. The media plays favorites. Partisans jigger the rules in their own favor. If Mr. Trump didn’t find a way to prevail in the world we actually live in, the blame starts with him.<br />Of course the microscopic margin rankles—he lost the pivotal electoral votes of Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin by fewer than 43,000 votes. He has every reason to be beside himself since he absurdly oversupplied these voters with reasons to vote against him and he still almost won.<br />Imagine a team so bad and good at the same time that it would have prevailed if it had fumbled the ball 1% fewer times in its own endzone.<br />Any loser has grievances. Ask John Kerry. But Mr. Trump griping about the media is like griping about his biggest asset. Having the right enemies made him president in the first place and was poised to serve him even better the second time around.</td>

It understands that OPEC+ members are struggling and would like to make a gesture of goodwill. A more realistic read is that the Kingdom’s hand has weakened considerably in its tug of war with Russia regarding the direction of global oil output.<br />In a press conference Tuesday, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud stressed that the decision was made unilaterally. Yet he also said Russia was aware of its plans to announce a cut.<br />Despite Saudi Arabia’s large capacity, a million barrels is a substantial sacrifice, equating to roughly 9% of its typical production. The amount is also symbolically a departure from the parallel path that Saudi Arabia and Russia had taken so far; the countries had been holding back an equal number of barrels.</td>

      <td>The new comedy from Robert Carlock and Tina Fey stars Ted Danson as a retired businessman turned mayor of Los Angeles.</td>
      <td>Ted Danson as the mayor of Los Angeles? It requires no stretch of the imagination at all, especially in electorally eccentric California: He’s extremely likable, telegenic, his style is self-effacing, and he’s tall enough to make his “Mr. Mayor” antagonist, Arpi Meskimen (Holly Hunter), seem like a ferocious Munchkin. The optics of television comedy and politics are essentially the same, the show reminds us. Blink and you’re not sure which you’re watching.<br />Or, in this case, when. “I was quarantining before it was cool,” former businessman Neil Bremer (Mr. Danson) tells the assembled L.A. press, having come out of a comfortable, sedentary and close-to-cloistered retirement to win the mayoralty with 68% of the vote (“of the 8% who voted,” someone reminds us). “Too soon,” mutters communications director Jayden Kwapis (Bobby Moynihan), and viewers may agree: The show acknowledges Covid-19 without making any concessions to it (masks, distancing, etc.) while still seeming to be set in the here and now, as Bremer’s predecessor is seen declaring that “2020 broke me!” before resigning his office and asking a green cab to drive him into the ocean. The show may be set in a not-too-distant, pandemic-free future, but there’s also the question of whether right now is the time for political comedy. It may be that the time is just right.<br />Created by Robert Carlock and Tina Fey, “Mr. Mayor” imagines what would happen if a wealthy, overly confident and intellectually incurious middle-aged-plus man—who previously led a billion-dollar outdoor-advertising company— were elected to one of the higher offices in urban America. Like previous projects the pair have been involved with, notably “30 Rock” and “The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” it dispenses with a laugh track, which is a bit risky given the ambiguity of some of the jokes, never mind the extreme L.A.-centric slant of the show. “He thinks Santa Monica is part of L.A.,” says Neil’s despairing chief of staff, Mikaela Shaw (Vella Lovell), who had only joined the Bremer campaign thinking the candidate would lose. She considers the mayor’s geographic impairment proof of his general ineptitude, but it’s pretty safe to say that a lot of people who live outside Southern California think Santa Monica is part of L.A. and might not quite grasp the hilarity of that particular laugh line. Likewise, Mikaela’s dismissive shorthand on Councilwoman Meskimen: “She represents East Hollywood, Little Bangladesh and the Hollywood Forever Cemetery,” which might be funny if you really know L.A. And even then...<br />Oddly enough, the show’s real potential lies in that same L.A.-Hollywood comedic landscape where a lot of the jokes get lost. Bremer is barely in office when there’s a dispute about whether the word “coyote” amounts to cultural appropriation, whether they should be called “mini-wolves” instead and get free reproductive services. One of Mr. Mayor’s first official acts is to announce a ban on plastic straws, which enrages two constituencies: his teenage daughter, Orly (Kyla Kenedy), because she’s made the issue part of her campaign for student-body president, and the disabled community, members of which need bendable straws. The latter find a champion in Arpi (sounds like R.P.), who during a private meeting with Bremer preps him for the political-correctness battles to come: “I want to see your water bill during the 2017 drought,” she says, devilishly. “Charter schools: Yea or nay? Did you post the black square on Instagram? Either way—how dare you!” The mayor, who proudly declares himself “not a politician,” is befuddled by the paradoxical proprieties of current-day American politics, which are portrayed by the series with refreshing frankness.<br />It took “Happy Days” five seasons to jump the shark; “Mr. Mayor” arguably does it in episode 2, with Bremer consuming some edibles at the ceremonial opening of L.A.’s “10,000th pot dispensary” (“Buy drugs!” he exhorts the crowd) and then careening from one public-relations calamity to another. The show has its charms, principally Mr. Danson, but his character will need some refining (only two episodes were available for review). Is he just a doofus, or a guy with enough native intelligence to make on-the-job training work? He seems to know how to deal with the pesky Meskimen, but their contretemps have just begun. “What’s your beef?” he asks Arpi, who replies—and you know it’s coming—“No beef. I’m a vegan.”</td>

      <td>A new Criterion set showcases three late films by the surrealistic and subversive Spanish director.</td>
      <td><br /><br />In one of the generous video supplements that add value to Criterion’s essential new set “Three Films by Luis Buñuel,” viewers will see a close-up of a photograph from 1972 picturing what must be the single greatest gathering of 20th-century film directors—among them George Cukor, Alfred Hitchcock, George Stevens, Billy Wilder, Robert Wise and William Wyler. (John Ford was also at the gathering, a lunch at Cukor’s house, but left before the photo.) And in the center of them all, seated between Stevens and Hitchcock, is Buñuel.<br />Born in Spain in 1900, Buñuel led a peripatetic life, with stints in France and the U.S. (where he made no films) before he settled in Mexico. Later, extended visits to France and Spain would return him to international prominence. In the process, he gave the world a number of cinematic landmarks, including the surrealistic touchstone “Un Chien Andalou” (1929), the damning “Los Olvidados” (1950) and the still discomfiting “Belle de Jour” (1967). What no one could have known—least of all Buñuel, who kept insisting he’d made his final film—was that ahead of him stretched the trio now gathered on Blu-ray: “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie” (1972), “The Phantom of Liberty” (1974) and “That Obscure Object of Desire” (1977). (Criterion’s previous editions of the films on DVD, once available singly but with fewer extras, are long out of print.)<br />In addition to being directed by Buñuel—or Don Luis, as he was often called—these three pictures were all co-written, in French, by Jean-Claude Carrière, shot by Edmond Richard and produced by Serge Silberman, Buñuel’s great champion during this Indian summer. Pierre Lary, Buñuel’s right hand in these years, also contributed manfully, working both behind and in front of the camera. But most viewers will focus on the casts, which feature a number of European stars: Jean-Claude Brialy, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Fernando Rey, Michel Piccoli, Delphine Seyrig, Monica Vitti, etc. Equally important is the group of lesser-known but no less gifted actors who enhance this informal triptych in small but significant roles—a Buñuel stock company that includes Julien Bertheau, Paul Frankeur, Milena Vukotic and Muni, among others.</td>

Mr. Garzón and the legal team have argued that Mr. Saab, who was granted citizenship by Mr. Maduro’s government, had been on a commercial mission for the regime and had diplomatic immunity.<br />Mr. Garzón said pressure from the U.S. has made it a challenge to win the release of Mr. Saab, who was arrested in June when his private plane stopped to refuel at Cape Verde, an island country nearly 400 miles off West Africa.</td>

      <td>A PBS docuseries examines the ways in which aid groups deal with natural catastrophes.</td>
      <td>Viewers should be forgiven if they see the listing “When Disaster Strikes,” shake their heads and say, “Oh Lord, what now?” But the three-part PBS docuseries is, despite its title, relatively upbeat, especially in the way it explains how global catastrophes are confronted, who does the confronting, and the degree of expertise they bring to floods, famines, droughts and hurricanes. It’s a series about bringing hope to seemingly hopeless situations, yes. But it is more about planning, competence and crisis management.<br />Audiences in most of the developed world might be grateful knowing they haven’t, or haven’t yet, been hammered by the kind of weather-related catastrophes suffered by the subject areas of the series, namely Mozambique, Somalia and the Bahamas. And seeing the way relief organizations respond when they do. More than 100 nongovernmental organizations came into Mozambique following the devastating Cyclone Idai of 2019, one of the most severe and costliest storms ever to hit Africa, or even the Southern Hemisphere, causing massive flooding and displacing hundreds of thousands. “When Disaster Strikes” is conscientiously unsentimental, but even a veteran aid worker like Emma Batey, a U.N.-associated coordinator of humanitarian aid groups, is brought to tears by the memory of how workers were forced to make choices about whom to save, or not, across a terrain where water stretched to the horizon and people took refuge in trees. “If you couldn’t swim there was no way to get out,” recalls one survivor.<br />The second installment (new episodes play Wednesdays at 10 p.m.) concerns the now-decade-old drought in Somalia, which as one of the interviewees points out is usually the kind of climate crisis that can be predicted and planned for. The exceptional problems of Somalia include the severity of the drought, its duration, and that fact that two-thirds of Somalis are nomadic, herders of livestock that have perished in droves from lack of water. Estimates say a quarter of a million lives have been lost over the course of the drought, but it is clear that without the resources—and resourcefulness—of the global support community, it would have been much worse.<br />The third episode deals with the Bahamas in the aftermath of 2019’s Hurricane Dorian and an aid effort spearheaded by the U.S. Navy, which deployed dozens of special aircraft, ships and personnel in its efforts to rescue and resuscitate the islands.<br />Narrated by Crystal Claire Simmonds, who strikes a balance somewhere between BBC World News and a Sarah McLachlan dog-rescue commercial, the series begins with an odd paraphrase of George Orwell: “All countries are equal. But when it comes to disasters, some countries are more equal than others.” It’s a baffling bit of rhetorical nonsense. The point that “When Disaster Strikes” makes, aside from celebrating various humanitarian aid efforts, is that some countries are more vulnerable to weather calamities than others—but that the humanitarian aid community draws no distinctions between African nations, Caribbean islands or, if it came to it, New York City. Not all disaster series are equal. But this one is certainly more reassuring than others.</td>

      <td>State Sen. Jim Brewster was certified as winner by election officials, but GOP leaders say a legal challenge remains</td>
      <td>Republicans leaders of the Pennsylvania Senate refused to seat a Democrat whose win was certified by state election officials, prompting Democratic senators to walk out on the first day of the legislative session.<br />The majority Senate Republicans on Tuesday also removed Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman from presiding over the day’s session in Harrisburg, the state capital, after Mr. Fetterman declined to go along with the move.<br />State officials certified incumbent Sen. Jim Brewster as the winner of a Senate contest in Western Pennsylvania. State election results show Mr. Brewster defeated his Republican challenger Nicole Ziccarelli by 69 votes out of more than 132,000 votes cast.<br />Republican Sen. Jake Corman, the top-ranking senator, said Monday he wouldn’t permit Mr. Brewster to be sworn in because of Ms. Ziccarelli’s pending lawsuit in federal court. The suit alleges that the Allegheny County Board of Elections improperly counted mail-in ballots that were signed but undated. In late November, the state Supreme Court ruled against Ms. Ziccarelli, finding that a missing date wasn’t a reason to invalidate a ballot.<br />“Ziccarelli’s position is that Pennsylvania election law is entirely clear that voters must sign and date their mail-in ballot to be counted,” Mr. Corman said in a statement.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Trump administration is removing criminal penalties for accidentally killing migratory birds, reversing longstanding federal policy in a move officials say will help landowners and businesses.<br />The final rule change, announced by the Interior Department Tuesday, completes changes proposed a year ago and in the works since 2017 to limit the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a 102-year-old law meant to protect the hundreds of bird species that are native to the U.S.<br />Business groups and local government officials have pushed for the change, saying criminal penalties are too harsh for accidental deaths.<br />But it comes at a time when bird populations are plummeting, facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.<br />Since 1970, North America has lost more than a quarter of its bird population, nearly 3 billion birds, according to research published in the journal Science in October 2019. The National Audubon Society said it recently recorded six million fewer birds in its 121st annual Christmas Bird Count than the year prior, despite record participation from counters.</td>

The official said Saudi Arabia had already begun working on implementing some of the measures, while other countries might take longer.<br />The exact terms of the deal weren’t made public, but instead were laid out in a document signed by all parties to the dispute plus the remaining members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the official said. Initial demands made of Qatar by the four countries were replaced by broad agreement on principles including nonintervention in others’ internal affairs and cooperating to confront threats to regional security.<br />“The Al-Ula declaration has achieved a settlement of all issues outstanding in a way that is entirely satisfactory to all nations involved,” Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told reporters after the gathering in the kingdom’s northwestern Al-Ula province. “All the outstanding [issues], whether it’s the returning of diplomatic relations, flights, etc., all of that will now go back to normal.”</td>

Both a House lawmaker and a senator need to object in writing to trigger debates and votes in both chambers on whether to disqualify a state’s electoral votes.<br />The senators’ objections are aimed at results in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania. None of the challenges are expected to succeed in the Democratic-controlled House or the GOP-run Senate, where party leaders have opposed the effort and a growing number of Republicans say they won’t join in.<br />Vice President Mike Pence is set to preside over the joint session, which will count the states in alphabetical order. While Mr. Pence’s role as president of the Senate is largely ceremonial, Mr. Trump has demanded that he intervene in the process.<br />Mr. Trump has claimed he lost the election due to widespread voter fraud, but he and his supporters have failed to present evidence that would change the outcome and have been rebuked in dozens of legal rulings. The challenge in Congress marks a last-ditch effort just two weeks from Inauguration Day.</td>

      <td><br />Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans pushed back Tuesday against the notion that changing the ultra-easy monetary policy stance of the Federal Reserve can reduce the risk it creates financial instability.<br />Since March, the Fed has had its short-term interest rate target set at near-zero levels, amid guidance that rate will be in place for several years to come. At the same time, the central bank is buying about $120 billion of Treasurys and mortgage bonds each month to support markets and keep real-world borrowing costs low.<br />Some observers worry this ultra easy stance during an economic recovery could encourage a destabilizing round of risk taking in financial markets. For that reason, they say the Fed should prepare to pull back on some of its support.<br />But Mr. Evans, who will have a vote at rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meetings this year, said monetary policy needs to focus on the economy and that Fed officials should turn to regulatory tools if they see any signs of financial sector trouble.</td>

      <td>It’s winter, and Covid’s got us largely homebound. If there ever was a time to trick out a cozy, comforting nook, it’s now.</td>
      <td>WHEN COVID-19 took hold, graduate student Anna Palmer claimed a compact hideaway under a stair landing in the Sewanee, Tenn., home she shares with her partner. She can barely stand up in the space—which is hemmed in by two book-lined walls and a honey-pine staircase. No matter. A small mattress, blankets, pillows and a long bolster encourage repose and hours of solace.<br />“It was essential that we find our own spaces and activities to mentally survive the pandemic,” said Ms. Palmer, 26. “Reading in the book nook was, and still is, my thing.”<br />Perhaps because they are so recently in utero, children unselfconsciously seek tiny spaces—assembling Legos under a table, playing house in the fireplace. In the Covid era, weary of open floor plans and an overload of togetherness, adults are becoming reacquainted with the pacifying powers of a hidy-hole. And though window seats can offer a restorative vantage point on nature, legit niches afford a more absolute feeling of envelopment.<br />“Having your back against the wall and a view of the world around you gives you the most secure sense of refuge,” said Dr. Sally Augustin, an applied environmental psychologist and author of “Designology: How to Find Your PlaceType and Align Your Life with Design” (Mango). In restaurants, for example, people gravitate toward seats and banquettes set against a wall, with a view of the door.<br />Although womb-like spots evoke feelings from our childhood pasts, a nook’s design can be very forward-looking. On a roomy stair landing in his Houston, Texas, family home, architect Christopher Robertson installed minimalist white bookshelves from floor to ceiling. Tucked into the center of the shelving is a white-oak-lined alcove he made cozy with a simple, white seat cushion and throw pillows in a lush, white cotton—modern yet not cold.</td>

In those arrangements, banks take on most of the risk of borrowers’ defaulting, while Ant pockets profits as the middleman.</td>

The breach was discovered last month and has compromised at least a half dozen cabinet departments and an unknown number of private companies.<br />Administration officials have jostled over how to respond to the hack, which current and former officials and cybersecurity experts have said amounts to one of the worst intelligence failures on record.</td>

      <td>Take off that hoodie. Inspired by the Nirvana frontman’s fuzzy mohair sweater, this season’s cozy, slouchy cardigans were made for the WFH era.</td>
      <td>ON NOV. 18, 1993, Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain ambled onto a stage at New York’s Sony Music Studios to perform on “MTV Unplugged.” Perched on a chair in a mohair, acrylic and Lycra cardigan the mossy color of a 1970s bathroom suite, he unwittingly created one of music’s most emblematic fashion references.<br />“It’s funny that the most important rock star of a generation would have his most memorable moment on film dressed like Ward Cleaver from ‘Leave it to Beaver,’” said Charles R. Cross, author of “Heavier Than Heaven,” a Cobain biography. “And it’s most likely he bought that cardigan from a thrift store in Olympia [Wash.] for a few dollars. That’s how he bought almost all of his clothes.” Mr. Cobain’s saggy sweater embodied the style of Seattle’s grunge scene and now, as work-from-home culture increasingly defines our times, that familiar knit is enjoying a revival.<br />As comfortable as your favorite hoodie but eminently cooler, roomy, mohair-blend cardigans emit WFH appeal. And you’ll have no problem finding one—even if you don’t frequent Pacific Northwest thrift stores. Myriad menswear brands featured Cobain-esque cardigans this season. An earthy ochre-brown take from French label Lemaire closely mimics the subdued original, for example, while Gucci accentuates its maximalist “geek chic” argyle design with chunky leather buttons. High-fashion iterations like those can range from the high three to low four figures, which, though far less than the $334,000 Mr. Cobain’s cardigan fetched at auction in 2019, will strain grunge budgets. Somewhat thriftier types can find suitably slouchy, sub-$400 knits from such labels as Pringle of Scotland and Beams Plus.<br />Mohair wasn’t always associated with the counterculture. In the 1960s, the material, which comes from Angora goats, surged in the men’s clothing market. Blended with wool, it added a slight sheen to suits, and later lent a whisper of plushness to highly textural knits. These “Mad Men”-era mohair sweaters tended to adhere to conservative motifs like argyle in quiet hues such as pistachio green and aubergine. Mr. Cobain’s sweater style—nonchalant, almost sloppy—subverted the mohair cardigan’s buttoned-up reputation.<br />“Mixing mohair with polyamides or acrylic, like Cobain’s cardigan, makes it even softer, and the Lycra in the mix means it retains its shape,” said Emma McClelland, co-director of Knitster LDN, a London atelier specializing in luxury knitwear production. “Those long fibers can be brushed for extra fluffiness. And, crucially, it also holds color really well.”</td>

      <td>The move came after a complex deal that effectively kept production from a group of big producers flat</td>
      <td>Saudi Arabia said it would unilaterally cut 1 million barrels a day of crude production starting next month, a surprise move signaling the kingdom’s worry that a resurgent coronavirus is threatening global economic recovery.<br />The announcement Tuesday came after Riyadh agreed earlier in the day with other big producers to keep the group’s collective output flat, after a now-monthly assessment by the Saudi-led OPEC cartel and a group of big producers led by Russia. In that deal, the two groups, collectively called OPEC-plus, agreed to a complex deal to hold production broadly unchanged from current levels.<br />Oil prices, which had already risen sharply on news of the OPEC-plus deal, soared on the Saudi announcement. In early afternoon trading Tuesday, West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. benchmark, were up 5.2% to $50.11 a barrel, passing through the $50 mark for the first time since last February. Brent crude rose 5.2% to $53.70 a barrel.<br />Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said the unilateral move was made “with the purpose of supporting our economy, the economies of our friends and colleagues, the OPEC-plus countries, for the betterment of the industry.”<br />It is far from clear whether the steep cut will continue to stabilize prices as virus cases climb sharply in many parts of the world, triggering new economic restrictions. For now, though, the move sent a stronger-than-expected message from the world’s most flexible producer that it was committed to keeping prices buoyant.</td>

      <td>President Trump signed into law another round of direct payments to households as part of a coronavirus aid package</td>
      <td>President Trump on Dec. 27 signed into law a roughly $900 billion coronavirus aid package that provides a second round of stimulus payments to households, and the money is already flowing. Here is what we know about who will receive the payments and how they will receive the money.<br />Eligible households will get $600 per adult and $600 a child, down from $1,200 and $500 in the first round delivered earlier in the pandemic. That means a single parent with two children will get $1,800 now after receiving $2,200 in the spring.<br />In all, the government will spend $164 billion on the second round.<br />The payments start phasing out when individual adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000, when head-of-household income exceeds $112,500, and when income for married couples filing jointly exceeds $150,000. For individuals without children, the payments go to zero when income reaches $87,000; that is $174,000 for married couples.<br />The payments happening now are generally based on 2019 income and household size. However, people who aren’t getting money now or who may be eligible for more money than they are getting now can still qualify with their 2020 information through their 2020 tax returns. That can happen for people whose income was above the limits in 2019 but declined in 2020 or for people who had a baby in 2020. In both situations, their ultimate benefit on the 2020 tax return could be larger than the payments they received last year and now.</td>

The 30-year yield is trading around 1.715%, from 1.655% Monday. Yields rise when bond prices fall.<br />Yields rose Tuesday after data from the Institute for Supply Management showed the U.S. manufacturing sector’s activity expanded in December at the quickest rate in more than two years. The ISM Manufacturing Report on Business PMI for December was 60.7, up from 57.5 in November and exceeded expectations from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, which forecasted a decline to 57.<br />The gains also came ahead of results from Tuesday’s runoff elections in Georgia, which will determine control of the U.S. Senate. Many investors believe that a Democratic capture of both seats would herald greater spending on pandemic-relief efforts, something analysts at TD Securities said could push the 10-year yield back above 1%—a level last hit in March.<br />The 10-year yield has traded within a range around 0.9% in recent weeks, constrained by a recovery that is progressing in fits and starts and Federal Reserve efforts to keep borrowing costs low. The central bank cut interest rates to near zero and has committed to buying billions of dollars of bonds to fuel the U.S. recovery.</td>

      <td>Veteran journalist Keith Poole will take over the New York Post Group as editor in chief in early March as the news organization seeks to boost its digital presence.<br />Mr. Poole, 44 years old, is currently deputy editor in chief of the Sun, a U.K. tabloid, which like the Post is owned by  News Corp —as is The Wall Street Journal. Col Allan, a former editor in chief of the Post who has served as a senior adviser since 2019, will retire in early March. A spokesman for News Corp said Mr. Poole’s role is a new position.<br />“I’ve always admired the bold and brash journalism of the New York Post, and to now be a part of this legendary organization is a dream come true for a journalist like me,” Mr. Poole said in a statement.<br />One person familiar with the promotion said Mr. Poole has a strong digital background. Before being elevated to his role at the Sun in February 2020, Mr. Poole was the organization’s digital editor. He worked earlier in his career at the Daily Mail, another U.K. publication, including a stint as managing editor of the MailOnline in New York.<br />Two senior editors at the Post will remain in place. Stephen Lynch, editor in chief of the print edition, and Michelle Gotthelf, editor in chief of the digital edition, will report to Mr. Poole.</td>

      <td>On behalf of the thousands of in-home care providers across the country, I thank Anna Wilde Mathews and Tom McGinty for their article “Nursing Homes Face Persistent Fall in Use” (Page One, Dec. 22). Our government must listen to citizens who want to stay at home as they age.<br />Modernizing federal and state Medicaid rules is a must. When they were created in the 1960s, the only option was to send grandparents to a “rest home” when their health began to fail. Today Americans can bring professional caregivers into their homes. Yet in state after state, Medicaid plans still consider only nursing homes an entitlement for older and disabled Americans, while home care is funded only when a state applies for a waiver.<br />It’s also time to look at Medicare offerings and provide seniors options that often cost less than what insurance pays. Four hours of personal care in a person’s home—helping with bathing, grooming, meal preparation and medication adherence—can prevent and delay the need for emergent care, hospitalizations and nursing homes. Medicare Advantage plans are permitted to pay for in-home care and other supplemental services. Why isn’t that same benefit offered to seniors who have elected traditional Medicare?<br />Vicki Hoak<br />Executive Director</td>

      <td>The system that saved the election is also slowing down the rollout of vaccines.</td>
      <td>Recent weeks have provided a crash course on the advantages and disadvantages of federalism. In U.S. politics, the powers of local governments are delegations from the states, but the powers from the state aren’t delegated from the national government. Rather, they exist independently, as secured by the Constitution. The line between federal and state powers is sometimes contested, but in many matters it’s clear.<br />For example, the 15th Amendment gives the federal government the right to enforce the equal right of every citizen to vote, regardless of race or color. But other parts of the Constitution—Article I, Sec. 4 and Article II, Sec. 1—assign states the principal role in determining the rules for electing the president as well as members of the House and Senate.<br />These constitutional realities were the crux of Sen. Tom Cotton’s refusal to join a dozen other Republican senators in challenging the results of the 2020 presidential election. The “Founders entrusted our elections chiefly to the states—not Congress,” Mr. Cotton said. “They entrusted the election of our president to the people, acting through the Electoral College—not Congress. And they entrusted the adjudication of election disputes to the courts—not Congress.”<br />To be sure, the Electoral Count Act of 1877 provides Congress a mechanism for challenging slates of electors under certain conditions, but these conditions have not been met this year. No state has sent dueling slates of electors to Congress, and every state met the legal deadline for certifying its results.<br />If the Constitution had established a unitary system for administering presidential elections, the two months since this year’s election could have played out very differently. Rather than pressing governors, legislators, secretaries of state and state electoral commissions to alter their results, President Trump could have tried to suborn a single national institution, with better prospects for success.</td>

      <td>The Obama-era idea that the economy was stuck in a cycle of low or no growth hit an iceberg in 2017.</td>
      <td>Janet Yellen had a puzzle on her hands in 2017. The economy was growing at the same time that something was dragging down inflation. The Federal Reserve’s statisticians dug into it and found “a large decline in telecommunication service prices,” which Ms. Yellen dismissed as an “idiosyncratic shift.” Actually, it was the tip of a supply-side iceberg headed toward the “secular stagnation” narrative of economic decline that had become so fashionable in Washington.<br />The Obama administration promulgated hundreds of new federal regulations that protected certain special interests from market competition. The beneficiaries included large banks, trial lawyers, big tech, major health-insurance companies, labor unions and foreign drug manufacturers. President Trump promised to undo all that, and in many cases succeeded, sometimes with the help of a Republican Congress. Ms. Yellen’s statisticians were witnessing the macroeconomic indicators of a March 2017 deregulation. It was a key part of the lifting of the prohibition on internet services that offered lower speeds at lower cost, or in return for greater user data, under the labels “net neutrality” and “protecting privacy.”<br />In a series of changes, some of them a half-century overdue, Mr. Trump also helped remove government obstacles to innovation and competition in health care. Democrats will tell you that the first calendar-year drop in retail prescription drug prices in 46 years was mere coincidence, not the result of deregulation. Mr. Trump’s first redirection of the Food and Drug Administration proved to be a warm-up act for Operation Warp Speed, which shocked the “experts” who predicted there was no way a Covid-19 vaccine could be approved in 2020.<br />Obama administration regulators waged a war on job creators, attacking them for their health insurance offerings, franchising practices, attorney-client relations and even timecard keeping. By pushing down wages and pushing up consumer prices, these employment and protectionist regulations were especially crushing to low-income households.<br />The Fed and the Obama economic team overpredicted growth almost every year from 2010-16. When growth failed to meet their rosy predictions, Mr. Obama’s advisers blamed the poor economic performance on America itself. The country, they said, had lost its innovative spirit and was aging into retirement. It was fundamentally incapable of anything more than tepid growth, insisted the secular stagnationists.</td>

      <td>Five members of the Cleveland Browns, including head coach Kevin Stefanski, received positive Covid-19 test results Tuesday morning, just days ahead of the franchise’s first playoff game in nearly two decades.<br />The results are a forceful indication of the bumpy road that lies ahead as the NFL begins its playoffs this weekend and looks to finish its pandemic season without severe disruption. The Browns, who hadn’t made the playoffs since 2002, are set to play the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night in a game that is suddenly tenuous because of Cleveland’s battles against the virus, which have persisted over several weeks.<br />The NFL said there is no change to the status of the game.<br />The Browns’ facility is currently closed as the league conducts tracing and evaluates the situation, the team said in a statement. The positive test result will sideline Stefanski, and the other positives, for at least 10 days, according to the NFL’s protocols, meaning they would miss Sunday’s game. Coaches also aren’t permitted to perform their duties remotely on game day during their mandated isolation. The team said that the club’s contingency plan calls for special teams coach, Mike Priefer, to serve as acting head coach in Stefanski’s absence.<br />“When it comes to competitive advantages, that’s not how we’re going to make decisions,” said JC Tretter, the Browns’ center who’s the president of the NFL Players Association. “We obviously have more work to do—tracing and figuring out where the virus is coming from and how to move forward.

      <td>Past recessions have badly hobbled manufacturers but this time they may emerge in better shape</td>
      <td>America has entered the darkest days of the coronavirus pandemic, but factories just keep doing better.<br />The Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday said that its index of manufacturing activity jumped to 60.7 in December from November’s 57.5, hitting its highest level in over two years. Any reading over 50 represents an expansion in manufacturing activity, but importantly it doesn’t gauge exactly how rapidly activity is expanding. Rather, higher numbers show that more factories are doing better than not.<br />Still, commentary included in the report suggested manufacturers are doing well, with some saying that business is now above pre-Covid-19 levels. That is a reflection of the atypical nature of the downturn, which hit usually recession-resistant services industries badly, but also spurred demand for a variety of manufactured goods, such as cars and washing machines. In past recessions, it has been the manufacturing sector that has been the most hobbled.<br />Manufacturers now have the spring to consider. If all goes well, the combination of the vaccination rollout and warmer weather will lead to dramatically fewer new Covid-19 cases, allowing consumers to lower their guards to some degree and state and local authorities to ease back on restrictions. Households that have weathered the crisis will have money to spend—the personal saving rate remains well above precrisis levels, and the new round of government payments many Americans are now receiving will augment that—while more unemployed service sector workers will be able to return to their jobs.<br />However, given that a lot of people loaded up on goods during the pandemic, effectively bringing a lot of demand forward, the easing of Covid-19’s grip might not be an outright boon for manufacturers. Many people will probably be more interested in taking family trips than in buying another kitchen appliance. Still, at least some new spending should flow toward manufacturing, keeping growth in the sector going.</td>

Of course if he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him quite as much.”<br />The pressure play Monday night came two days before Mr. Pence is set to take on perhaps his most politically challenging task in four years as a loyal second-in-command. On Wednesday he will oversee a joint session of Congress that is expected to ratify Democrat President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win, even as Mr. Trump continues to reject the results and some Capitol Hill allies plan to contest some state results.<br />On Tuesday, Mr. Trump added further pressure by tweeting, “The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors.”<br />The states have already certified their results from their electors, and the vice president doesn’t have the power to alter them.</td>

In the difficult situations students face this year, should the normal rules apply? Readers weighed in. Here are edited excepts of their comments.<br />I am a high school teacher in Sarasota, Fla. While grading a unit test, I discovered an unusual pattern. About 25% of my remote Algebra 2 students were using a free app to solve math problems and a Snapchat group to cheat. Most have admitted it, but others have denied it.<br />I am still upset. As hard as I’m working to help them learn math, to be successful now and in the future, they outright cheat. I have asked remote students to show their workspace. Somehow, on test days, students seem to have technology issues that prevent them from doing this.<br />How do we stop this cheating? I could say, “Let them cheat.” They will suffer the consequences when they take the SAT, ACT, and future math classes. I could also say, “Let them learn Algebra 2 on their own from the book,” but this is not right. I just don’t have the answer to the cheating.<br />Beth Reuger</td>

      <td>The collapse in oil prices triggered by the coronavirus pandemic handed a big payday to Pierre Andurand, one of the few hedge-fund managers to have survived years of disappointing returns in commodity markets.<br />Best known for bullish wagers on crude that led to banner returns during the oil-price boom ending in 2008, Mr. Andurand began to bet against oil when parts of China closed to contain Covid-19 in early 2020. The virus soon hammered demand for oil and other fuels globally, prompting a market rout. U.S. crude futures eventually tumbled below $0 a barrel for the first time in history.<br />The wager propelled Mr. Andurand’s flagship fund, part of London-based investment firm Andurand Capital Management LLP, to return 69% for the year as a whole, according to a person familiar with the matter. That snapped two years of losses for the fund, which was burned when oil prices dropped in late 2018. The gains in 2020 marked its biggest advance since its inception in 2013.<br />A second fund that gives Mr. Andurand more leeway to take risk gained 154%, the person familiar with the matter said. That placed it among the best-performing hedge funds globally in 2020, according to a weekly report on fund performance by  HSBC Holdings  PLC.<br />Mr. Andurand is one of the most prominent survivors of a troubled decade for hedge funds that specialize in raw materials like oil, coffee and cocoa. Hampered by choppy and often falling markets, firms including Astenbeck Capital Management, Armajaro Asset Management and Brevan Howard have all closed commodities funds.</td>

      <td>Bank lowers growth outlook as pandemic disrupts trade, investment and education</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Even before Covid-19, the World Bank had lowered its projections for global growth in the 10 years that began in 2020. The pandemic is exacerbating that trend, raising the prospect of a “lost decade” ahead, the World Bank said Tuesday, as it also cut its forecasts for the coming year.<br />The bank’s semiannual Global Economic Prospects report attributes the long-term downgrade to lower trade and investment caused by uncertainty over the pandemic, along with disruptions in education that will hamper gains in labor productivity.<br />“If history is any guide, unless there is substantial reform, we think the global economy is headed for a decade of disappointing growth outcomes,” Ayhan Kose, the bank’s acting vice president for equitable growth and financial institutions, said in an interview.<br />Before the pandemic, the bank projected that potential global growth between 2020 and 2029 would slow to a yearly average of 2.1%, from 2.5% in the previous decade, as a result of aging populations and lower productivity growth. On Tuesday the bank lowered its projection to 1.9%. Potential output assumes the world economy is operating at full employment and capacity.<br />The World Bank said the global economy is expected to grow 4% this year after contracting 4.3% in 2020. That 2021 projection is 0.2 percentage point lower than it forecast last June, reflecting the resurgence of the coronavirus and renewed restrictions on economic activity.</td>

      <td>Overinvestment in property is incentivized by subsidies and favorable treatments in the tax system that governments could withdraw</td>
      <td>Overinvestment in real estate is a problem for the economy. A growing body of research suggests that it saps future output by sucking capital away from more productive uses. And housing is a particular culprit.<br />There are a number of possible ways to solve the problem—none of them easy.<br />Homeownership bias, meaning the incentive to invest in property rather than other assets, exists in the most of advanced economies. This means less money is invested in things that boost productivity like machinery and new technologies.<br />When thinking about how housing is taxed, it’s useful to think of ownership and actual use—as in living there—as separate economic categories. Owning a property is the investment side of the equation, but living there is a form of consumption.<br />If a homeowner rents out their property, that income is taxed. But when they live in it, essentially renting it to themselves, it isn’t. And that is the major advantage to homeownership over other forms of asset ownership: Imputed rents aren’t usually taxed.</td>

      <td>TAIPEI—China sentenced the former chairman of one of the country’s biggest state-owned asset-management companies to death on bribery and corruption charges, a striking signal in Beijing’s campaign to rein in financial risk-taking.<br />Lai Xiaomin, chairman of  China Huarong Asset Management Co.  from 2012 to 2018 when he was fired for graft, was accused by a local Chinese court in the northern city of Tianjin of taking bribes totaling a record high of more than 1.79 billion yuan, equivalent to $277 million.<br />Mr. Lai’s crimes were particularly serious, the court said Tuesday, given the scale of his bribery, which included several transactions in the hundreds of millions of yuan each as well as the act of proactively soliciting bribes. The court characterized him as being “lawless and extremely greedy,” with his actions “endangering the nation’s financial security and financial stability.”<br />Mr. Lai couldn’t be reached for comment.<br />By Chinese law, officials can face the death penalty, either by firing squad or lethal injection, for bribery totaling as little as three million yuan. Still, Chinese courts seldom resort to the death penalty for corruption, and accounts of financial bribery in China frequently total in the tens of millions of yuan.</td>

      <td>Falling U.S. dollar, coronavirus concerns lift precious metal</td>
      <td>Investors are pouring back into gold, lured by a weak U.S. dollar and surging Covid-19 infections that are muddling the outlook for a swift global economic recovery.<br />Most actively traded gold futures for February delivery climbed more than 3% in the first two trading sessions of the year, to around $1,954.30 a troy ounce. The gains add further momentum to the haven metal’s year-end rally, with cautious investors piling into a variety of precious metals, including silver and platinum.<br />Gold posted its best annual performance in a decade in 2020, climbing more than 24%, though it remains well below the record $2,069.50 hit in August. It retreated later in the year, when investors shifted into riskier assets like stocks, expecting vaccines to fuel a broad economic rebound.<br />However, growing worries in the new year about a new strain of the coronavirus in Europe and the U.K. have boosted the appeal of havens including gold in recent sessions.<br />A falling U.S. dollar has also lifted the metal. Since gold is bought and sold with dollars, a weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for foreign investors. Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs, broadly predict the dollar will tumble in 2021, dragged on by negative real yields—or the return on bonds when adjusting for inflation—with the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates at record-low levels. Low real yields make gold a more attractive haven alternative to bonds.</td>

We had signed her a year earlier to record our songs, and we were signed to Scepter Records.<br />Dionne had a singular voice that was perfect for us—young, earthy, edgy and confident.

      <td>Buying Quibi’s catalog looks opportunistic, but a bigger shift into content would be expensive</td>
      <td>It is hard to blame Roku for wanting to be a player, but the content game is a very expensive one to play in.<br />The maker of TV streaming boxes and related services is near a deal to buy the catalog of Quibi—the short-form video service that turned out to be extremely short-lived. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday of advanced talks between the two that would give Roku control over Quibi’s library. No purchase price was reported. Roku’s largest deal to date has been its $151 million acquisition of Dataxu, which provides a platform of advertising tools, in 2019.<br />Roku may be best known for its boxes and TV sets bearing its brand, but the company generates most of its revenue—and the vast majority of its gross profit—from its platform side, which includes advertising, subscription and transaction fees generated by programs and streaming services accessed through the company’s hardware. That side of the business has averaged revenue growth of 74% on a year-over-year basis each quarter over the past eight periods, but it also depends largely on content owned by other, much larger companies.<br />Buying Quibi’s library would give Roku a base of its own content to work with. But the value of that content remains questionable, given Quibi’s rather quick flameout. The service offering shows broken up into short-form, smartphone-ready video chunks for $5 a month launched in April and lasted six months before announcing it would shut down. The failure was likely accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic keeping people at home and thus not having to rely on phones for TV viewing. It is also possible, though, that Quibi’s shows just weren’t good enough to cut through the noise in a crowded streaming market.<br />If so, Roku’s opportunistic play to pick up a batch of content on the cheap may turn into a problem if it portends what could be an expensive shift in strategy. Hollywood giants and tech titans alike are pouring billions into the creation of shows and movies for their respective streaming services. Netflix alone spends an average of more than $3 billion a quarter on content—double Roku’s current annual revenue.</td>

      <td>When Roy Piscitello first sat in the Bentley Continental GTC Speed, he knew it was a good fit for his 6-foot-7 frame. And tiny toy replicas are a good fit for the grandkids.</td>
      <td>Roy Piscitello, 72, a retired restaurateur living in Chapel Hill, N.C., on his 2010 Bentley Continental GTC Speed, as told to A.J. Baime.<br />I opened Breadmen’s, a diner in Chapel Hill, in 1974. After a lot of eggs and hamburgers, we expanded into real estate. When I started thinking about getting out of the business a few years ago, I decided to look for a special car. I have been a car fan since my first one—a 1967 Mustang convertible—which my aunt Rita, who is still alive at 95, helped me buy.<br />I am 6-foot-7, and unfortunately, I don’t fit in a lot of cars. I don’t fit in a Porsche, or a Mercedes SL, or most BMWs. I visited an Aston Martin dealership; I could fit into the car, but I couldn’t get out of it. I went to a dealership in Charlotte and there was this Bentley on the lot. When I sat in this car, I knew it was the one, and I bought it in 2015. It was previously cared-for; I don’t use the word used, when it comes to Bentleys.<br />Bentley Motors makes cars at a factory in Crewe, England. Back in the 1920s, the so-called Bentley Boys used to drive their cars all over the place and they won a lot of races, putting this company on the map. Today it is owned by Volkswagen and there is a lot of German technology in the cars. Bentley makes more cars than they used to, but you still don’t see a lot of them. I think mine is the only one in my town.<br />The word Speed in the name Bentley uses to describe its higher-performance cars, like a Chevrolet Super Sport or Mercedes AMG. Mine has tremendous power—600 horsepower—and a unique W-12 engine, which is like two V-6s put together. The top speed is around 200 mph, though I have never taken it there. People seem to love the looks of it. If I am ever feeling down, I go gas up the car and inevitably someone will smile and say, “Hey, nice car!” I feel instantly better.</td>

He is set to take over on June 30, the company said.<br />Mr. Amon succeeds Mr. Mollenkopf, 52, who was promoted from president to CEO in 2014 and led the company through several years of unprecedented challenges. They included a long-running legal struggle with Apple over Qualcomm’s patent-licensing practices, an antitrust case brought by the Federal Trade Commission, repelling an activist investor, averting a hostile takeover and having a $44 billion acquisition scrapped amid U.S.-China political tensions.<br />Mr. Mollenkopf, who has been with Qualcomm for 26 years, is to remain an adviser to the company for a period after Mr. Amon succeeds him, the company said. In a statement, the departing CEO said it was the right time to make the change with questions about the company’s business model behind it and large new opportunities before it.<br />Mark McLaughlin, Qualcomm’s chairman, said Mr. Mollenkopf faced “more in his seven years as CEO than most leaders face in their entire careers,” citing his guiding of the company through its challenges.</td>

The startup grew from a fledgling internet business matching wholesale buyers and sellers into a fast-growing technology empire, with business interests spanning e-commerce, cloud computing and logistics and annual sales in excess of $86 billion.<br />Alibaba’s success in e-commerce also helped fuel the rise of its companion payments app Alipay, which formed the basis for Ant Group Co., a separate finance affiliate controlled by Mr. Ma whose digital platforms handle online and physical store transactions for millions of Chinese every day. In September 2019, Mr. Ma retired, handing over the reins at Alibaba and turning his focus to philanthropy, traveling around the world to promote education, entrepreneurship and other causes.<br />Until recently, Mr. Ma, who is a Communist Party member, was held up as a role model by the Party for his contribution to the “digital economy.”<br />Mr. Ma last appeared publicly in late October, when he spoke at a financial forum in Shanghai. There he delivered a speech that was highly critical of Chinese regulators, who he said had stifled innovation in the financial industry. “We shouldn’t use the way to manage a train station to regulate an airport,” Mr. Ma said then. “We cannot regulate the future with yesterday’s means.” Shortly after the speech, regulators scrapped a planned initial public offering of Ant that would have been the world’s largest to date, raising more than $34 billion from listings in Hong Kong and Shanghai.</td>

Baird.<br />The coronavirus pandemic turned the rental-apartment market upside down in 2020. Before Covid-19 hit, rents in many cities were outpacing those in the suburbs as urban areas attracted young professionals seeking downtown amenities and shorter commutes.<br />But the pandemic altered the equation. Rents have fallen by double-digit percentages in San Francisco and Manhattan because white-collar workers have moved on to rural and suburban locales. The departure of those tenants helped boost rents this year in the suburbs, particularly those in the Stamford, Conn.; Las Vegas; and Sacramento, Calif., areas, according to rental-price data from  CoStar Group .</td>

The stock’s spectacular rally has helped one of China’s poorest provinces, too.<br />Shares of Moutai have more than tripled in the past two years, making it by far the world’s most valuable alcohol company. Moutai’s market value broke through $400 billion Tuesday after hitting another record. That means the company, the most valuable listed in mainland China,  is worth more than  Nestlé  and  Procter & Gamble .<br />The famously fiery spirit—often served at state banquets—has become a status symbol, as well as an indicator of Chinese consumers’ spending on high-end goods. Its premium brand means it is able to maintain pricing power. Moutai’s revenue and profit grew around 10% in 2020, the company said this week.<br />Some more premium versions of the liquor have become an investment in themselves. That has prompted state newspapers such as the People’s Daily to weigh in: “Alcohol is for drinking, not speculating, and definitely not for corruption.”<br />Moutai shares’ gain has benefited investors, including many foreign ones. But it has also helped the province of Guizhou, where the company is based. Moutai’s state-owned parent, which owns 58% of the company, agreed in December to transfer a 4% stake—worth around $16 billion—to a separate investment company owned by the provincial government.</td>

They even attracted a star-studded group of backers, ranging from basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal to former House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan.<br />As celebrities and well-known institutions entered the sector, the biggest banks also increased their activity. Two— Credit Suisse Group AG  and  Citigroup Inc. —together accounted for nearly 30% of the underwriting, followed by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.<br />A SPAC is a public firm that uses the money raised from an initial public offering to merge with another company, typically within a few years. That target company then gets the SPAC’s position on a stock exchange, allowing it to tap public markets. The pandemic has sparked a record run, with hot startups in areas such as electric vehicles and cannabis seeking to capitalize on investors’ burgeoning enthusiasm.<br />Banks find buyers for a company’s shares and backstop the stock price. In return, they typically get a fee of 2% of the money raised in the initial listing, then another 3.5% when the company completes its deal with the target. While those fees can be lower than the money that banks raise in traditional IPOs, Wall Street firms also can earn extra fees by advising a company on its SPAC deal or raising more money for the purchase.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The House on Monday passed rules that weakened a procedural tool Republicans had used to force Democrats to take tough political votes as well as added exemptions to a budget rule that progressives deemed a win.<br />The rules package for the new Congress passed on partisan lines in a 217-206 vote. The rules are set by the majority party’s leadership and must be passed at the beginning of each session of Congress.<br />The new package strengthens congressional oversight, seeks to protect whistleblowers and specifically defines that any current and former White House employees can be subpoenaed. It also renews proxy voting, which allows lawmakers to vote remotely during the pandemic by designating a lawmaker to vote on their behalf. Republicans object to the remote-voting rule and are disputing it in court, though some GOP lawmakers have used it.<br />The package also instructs lawmakers to honor all gender identities by changing pronouns and familial relationships in the House rules to be gender-neutral. Among specific changes, the new rules strike ‘‘himself or herself’’ and insert ‘‘themself,” and changes “chairman” to “chair.” The rules also change familial terms to make them gender neutral, changing “uncle” and “aunt” to “parent’s sibling,” for example.<br />Democrats said the rules change was designed to reflect the increasingly diverse Congress, but Republicans said the move was absurd.</td>

The minimum rose to $12.50 from $11.80 an hour in the rest of New York state outside New York City, where all employers hit the $15 hourly wage requirement at the end of 2019.<br />State law requires the New York State Division of the Budget to analyze the impact of recent minimum-wage increases and the health of the economy before the state moves forward with scheduled increases. A 2016 law, which raises the minimum wage over several years to $15 an hour, is scheduled to reach the threshold in Long Island and Westchester in 2021.<br />Roberta Reardon, commissioner of the New York State Department of Labor, had the option of delaying the wage boost but said the labor markets affected by the increase—meaning those outside New York City—are leading the state’s economic recovery.<br />The unemployment rate for Long Island and Westchester, for example, fell to 7.1% in October from its pandemic peak of 15.4% in April, according to the report. The national unemployment rate was 6.9% in October, according to the U.S. Labor Department.</td>

      <td>For all the attention devoted to Republicans contesting Joe Biden’s victory, the party with the best chance to overturn a federal election this year remains the Democrats.<br />Nancy Pelosi, who was narrowly elected again as Speaker on Sunday, allowed the Republican winner in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional district, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, to take her seat. But that may not be the last word on the election, which Democrat Rita Hart hasn’t conceded. Mrs. Pelosi’s spokesman said Ms. Miller-Meeks would be seated “provisionally” and “pending the outcome” of a House probe.<br />The House has the power to decide contested elections of its Members. Mrs. Pelosi is saying that the Democratic-controlled Committee on House Administration reserves the right to recommend muscling Ms. Miller-Meeks out of her seat months from now, when Mr. Trump’s challenge is history.<br />Ms. Miller-Meeks, a physician and state senator, won the district by six votes. Her victory was confirmed in a recount, and the state certified the results Nov. 30. More than three weeks later Marc Elias, the Democratic election lawyer who specializes in vote-counting mischief (Al Franken in 2008), presented the House with a list of 22 ballots he says should have been counted and would result in a net 15-vote swing to Ms. Hart.<br />The most straightforward response for Ms. Miller-Meeks, whose lawyers have to respond this month, is that the Hart campaign forfeited a House challenge because it never asked a state court to review the ballots under Iowa law.</td>

      <td>His advisers cling to the 2015 deal, but the region has moved on.</td>
      <td>President Trump’s maximum-pressure sanctions campaign against Iran will continue until his final day in office—and so will Tehran’s escalating violations of the 2015 nuclear deal. While the facts on the ground change, Joe Biden’s policy hasn’t.<br />Iran is now enriching uranium to 20% purity, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed Monday. This is below the 90% needed for a bomb but a big leap above the accord’s 3.67% limit. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says he was “bound” by the Iranian parliament, which passed a law mandating the escalation. But this crosses a red line for the European countries that have tried to keep the deal alive since Mr. Trump’s 2018 withdrawal.<br />The regime also said Monday that it had detained a vessel from South Korea, which is in a dispute with Tehran over frozen bank accounts. Last month Mr. Trump blamed Iran-backed militias for the largest attack on Baghdad’s Green Zone since 2010. Iran was also likely behind a series of cyber attacks against dozens of Israeli firms at the end of 2020.<br />This shouldn’t surprise anyone: Tehran has been a regional menace for 40 years. Mr. Trump’s newly acquired sanctions leverage could eventually forge a better deal, but it was always unlikely in his first term. Watching Iran break out from the deal so easily is a reminder of how sweet the 2015 accord’s terms are for Tehran, which bet on waiting out Mr. Trump for a Democrat.<br />Mr. Biden has said the U.S. will comply with the agreement again as soon as Iran does. This ostensibly would be followed by negotiations over other malign Iranian behavior. “In that broader negotiation, we can ultimately secure limits on Iran’s ballistic missile technology,” Mr. Biden’s National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in an interview over the weekend.</td>

      <td>Trillions for Covid relief, very little to address medical training.</td>
      <td>Hospitals in much of America are triaging Covid-19 patients because they are short of staff, especially doctors trained in emergency-care and anesthesiology. Blame Congress, which rationed the supply of new physicians two decades ago and is only now addressing its mistake, albeit not nearly enough.<br />The $900 billion relief bill  adds 1,000 new Medicare-funded graduate medical education (GME) positions over five years. A Congressional bill summary boasts about the doctor-training expansion, though it requires a microscope to find amid the spending fat.<br />Since 1965 Medicare has funded the vast majority of residency positions at hospitals, which are essentially apprenticeships for medical school graduates. During the early 1990s economists and physician groups sounded alarms about a physician glut—their theory being that more doctors would result in needless treatments and health spending.<br />Congress responded in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by capping Medicare-funded residency positions at 1996 levels and paying hospitals to eliminate positions. Health-maintenance organizations were supposed to limit health-care utilization and spending while the population and demand increased.<br />Yet introductory economics teaches that prices will rise when demand increases and supply stays the same. This has happened in health care. Government has kept a lid on physician fees for Medicare and Medicaid, but doctors increased rates charged to private insurers to compensate. Hospitals have also discovered they can generate more revenue if in-house doctors perform more treatments. So hospitals have acquired independent physician practices, which has reduced competition and driven up health spending. ObamaCare’s payment models accelerated these trends.</td>

Brockman, the former chief executive of automotive software-maker Reynolds & Reynolds Co., had sought the move, arguing that he lives in Houston and has been treated for dementia. Mr. Brockman, 79 years old, had also sought a hearing to determine whether he is mentally competent to stand trial.<br />U.S. District Judge William Alsup on Monday didn’t rule on whether Mr. Brockman, accused of staging the biggest individual tax dodge ever, is fit to assist in his own defense. Mr. Brockman’s residence in Houston, the possibility of hardship related to his illness, and San Francisco’s crowded docket weighed in favor of moving the case to Houston, Judge Alsup wrote.<br />The case against Mr. Brockman stems from allegations that he evaded taxes tied to his profits on investments in private-equity funds managed by Vista Equity Partners, a firm founded by billionaire Robert Smith, the wealthiest Black person in the U.S.<br />Mr. Smith, who lives in Austin, Texas, admitted last year to evading $43 million in federal taxes from 2005 to 2014 and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department’s prosecution of Mr. Brockman. Vista primarily invests in software companies. Mr. Smith’s leniency deal required him to pay $139 million in fines and back taxes but saved him from prosecution.</td>

According to the National Restaurant Association, 110,000 have permanently closed and more than 500,000 are “in an unprecedented economic decline.” In November alone, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, restaurants and bars lost 17,400 jobs as new state lockdowns took effect.<br />But while national brands lose in lockdown-happy states, many are able to compensate with revenue from their locations in places with minimal restrictions.<br />National chains that are known for delivery are actually seeing sales improve. Domino’s third-quarter U.S. sales were up 17.5%;  Papa John’s  were up 24%.

      <td>Can the president-elect carry Democrats other than himself to victory?</td>
      <td>On Tuesday  the American people will learn two things from Georgia’s Senate runoffs. One is whether Donald Trump, amid all his election controversies, can rally his troops in numbers sufficient to put Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue over the top. The other is whether Joe Biden has any coattails.<br />Thus far attention on Georgia has focused on President Trump, and for good reason. Not only did he lose a state that hasn’t gone for a Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1992, he’s now made himself the main issue in the two Senate runoffs. And the outcome will affect all Americans, because it will determine whether the Biden agenda will sail through a Democratic Congress or be blocked and tempered by a Republican Senate.<br />But there’s been zero attention on the equally compelling question about Mr. Biden: Can he carry Democrats other than himself to victory?<br />The November election suggests he can’t. Start with the Senate, which Democrats were favored to win. Instead, they  have 48 seats, so they need to sweep both Senate runoffs to get to a 50-50 tie in which Kamala Harris would then cast the deciding vote.<br />Democrats fared even worse in the House. Though expectations were that Democrats would pick up seats, Republican victories narrowed Nancy Pelosi’s Democratic majority to 11 votes from 37. Having Mr. Biden on the ticket may have helped Democrats such as Pennsylvania’s Conor Lamb eke out victories in more moderate districts, but the Biden-led blue wave proved a dud.</td>

      <td>Is it worth having central hubs and ofﬁce towers or would it be better just to rent space for a week every quarter to gather distributed teams?</td>
      <td>For much of the past century, work has been a place where people went. For big organizations, a workplace meant “concrete, steel and glass monuments built to service commerce and Mammon; commanding the skyline of the modern cityscape and dominating the lives of the millions of people who work in them.” So observes corporate real-estate veteran Chris Kane in “Where Is My Office?” But now, he says, “the world of work is changing.” Office work especially is “no longer anchored in one place.” Indeed, he notes, work has become a thing that people do and not a place where people go.<br />So what is to become of those monuments to Mammon? And how about all those workers whose lives were dominated by them? Mr. Kane explores this question in his intriguing, if meandering, book on “reimagining the workplace for the 21st century.”<br />Much has been written on the future of work, mostly by management gurus. Mr. Kane comes at the question from a different angle, with a background in the property business—mostly, though not exclusively, in the U.K. He calls himself an “industry provocateur” who has spent his career persuading the people who finance and build offices to think about what their tenants will actually want. (Oddly enough, they don’t seem to want the “uninspiring spaces of beige, grey or off-white” that the industry delivers.) He has also helped large companies rethink their property portfolios, urging executives to see that property can be converted “from a cost centre into a value creator.” He observes that “a well-designed and well-run workplace has beneficial effects on the performance of its occupants.” They collaborate. They feel inspired. They don’t quit quite as quickly. Handled well, property can be a strategic tool.<br />Mr. Kane acted on this principle most notably at the BBC, where, beginning in 2004, he oversaw a vast property reorganization. He recounts shrinking the BBC’s total real-estate footprint, modernizing its facilities with new systems and networks for digital technology, moving functions out of expensive London, and transforming the BBC’s historic buildings into redevelopment projects. By building independent studio and media-company space in the BBC’s old Television Centre, creating new parkland, and tying the complex to a nearby shopping development, he helped leverage the BBC brand to create a place that other brands clamored to become part of.<br />While the BBC case study is fascinating, the rest of “Where Is My Office?” is a bit unsatisfying for anyone looking for answers to the question of what the workplace of the future will look like. One reason may be that no one knows, especially now that Covid has changed daily work rhythms. Mr. Kane is also keenly aware that many past attempts to rethink office life have resulted in ideas that are questionable at best: Witness seas of soul-deadening cubicles or the attempts to do away with assigned seating completely that ended up with much-hated “hot desking” policies—everyone has to fend for herself every morning to score a workable spot.</td>

      <td>With many Covid-delayed albums set for release in 2021, here are 10 singles from Drake, Lana Del Rey, Foo Fighters and others that further ratchet up the anticipation.</td>
      <td>An artist or label considering releasing music in 2020 had to make some calculations: How important would live promotion be to this record’s success? Would the music still be timely if it sat on the shelf for six months or more? Would the artist have the financial means to put a completed album on hold? How difficult would it be to record the music in an age of social distancing? The answers to these and other questions led to one of the stranger release years in memory, light on big names and heavy on collections of live and unreleased material culled from the archives. The first half of 2021 will most likely be a continuation of 2020’s patchwork. Touring as we knew it before the pandemic won’t be back anytime soon. But even at this early date there are a number of potentially important records from artists who find themselves at a crucial juncture—trying to maintain momentum after a breakthrough, returning after years away, struggling to take their music to a new place. Here’s a look at 10 tracks from such albums, most of which should come out this year—some have release dates, some are tentative, and one hasn’t been announced.<br />Torch singer Lana Del Rey first mentioned “Chemtrails Over the Country Club,” the follow-up to her 2019 LP “Norman F—ing Rockwell,” back in May, and it was at one point scheduled for release this past fall. But Ms. Del Rey pushed it back, and it seems likely to come out in the first half of 2021. The advance single “Let Me Love You Like a Woman” was produced and co-written by Ms. Del Rey’s frequent creative partner Jack Antonoff, and with its spare piano part it pretty much picks up where her last record left off.<br />We expected a sixth studio album from Toronto’s Drake in 2020, but the rapper and singer born Aubrey Graham instead put out “Dark Lane Demo Tapes,” a mishmash of old tracks and previously unreleased material. The long awaited LP, “Certified Lover Boy,” is coming later this month, and our first taste of music from it came in the form of “Laugh Now Cry Later,” featuring Chicago rapper Lil Durk. The song is loose and breezy and breaks no new ground for Drake, but his effortless melodic style is intact.<br />Dave Grohl’s Foo Fighters last released a full-length record in 2017. The group’s 10th studio album, “Medicine at Midnight,” is coming Feb. 5. The most recent advance single, “No Son of Mine,” dropped last week, and it found the band in a familiar hard-rocking zone, but “Shame Shame” from November is more interesting: Moody and subtle with R&B inflections, it finds Mr. Grohl exploring the upper end of his vocal range to intriguing effect.<br />The past year was a great one for the younger generation of rock songwriters, particularly women. Both Phoebe Bridgers and Waxahatchee had creative breakthroughs, and they made two of 2020’s best records. Julien Baker is a member of the indie supergroup Boygenius—with Ms. Bridgers and Lucy Dacus—and she has a solo album, “Little Oblivions,” coming Feb. 26. Ms. Baker’s music is explosive, with screamed choruses about emotional torment, but her new song “Faith Healer” sees her smoothing out rough edges while keeping her trademark intensity.</td>
