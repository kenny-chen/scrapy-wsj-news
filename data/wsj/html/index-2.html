      <td>Making financial markets accessible is about ensuring low costs for savers. Allowing anyone to trade complex products could undermine that goal.</td>
      <td>Was the Reddit mania a win for “democratizing” investment? Or was it a demonstration that too much people power in financial markets stokes dangerous bubbles? As with all democracy, it will depend on the outcome for those less powerful.<br />On Friday,  GameStop  closed at around $64, 87% below its peak on Jan. 28. Other companies recently targeted by individual investors online, such as AMC and  BlackBerry ,  also deflated. The Treasury Department concluded on Thursday that “the core [market] infrastructure was resilient.”<br />The real political fallout, though, may be to come. Officials are investigating financial misconduct, particularly by brokerage firms that restricted purchases of some stocks last week. Politicians on both sides of the aisle lamented that professional speculators were protected at the expense of small traders. Brokers said they only took action because of risk limits imposed by clearing firms.<br />An explicit goal of Reddit gamblers was to torpedo hedge funds’ short bets, which they see as fraudulent manipulation by a Wall Street cabal. Yet trades by the Reddit gang also ended up benefiting many asset managers, including hedge funds.<br />But focusing on whether amateur or professional investors won or lost more in the GameStop saga risks missing the point. Most asset managers make their money through fees, not superior investment returns.</td>

      <td>TOKYO— SoftBank Group Corp.  rode red-hot stock markets to a big quarterly profit, largely on the back of investment gains at its $100 billion Vision Fund and its $10 billion successor.<br />The Japanese technology investor said Monday that it posted a net profit of ¥1.17 trillion, equivalent to about $11 billion, on investment gains of ¥1.77 trillion during the quarter ended Dec. 31. Nearly 80% of the investment gains were due to strong performance at Vision Funds 1 and 2.<br />Anticipation of strong results pushed SoftBank’s stock price up 4.4% to ¥9,485 Monday—a level last seen in February 2000, when the company’s shares peaked during the internet bubble.<br />“We’ve finally entered the harvest phase” for the Vision Fund, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said at a Tokyo news conference, standing in front of a slide showing a goose laying towering columns of golden eggs that represented SoftBank’s investment hits.<br />The results highlight how much the boom in public markets over the last several months has benefited SoftBank, which during the past year completed its metamorphosis into an investment holding company from a telecommunications conglomerate. Climbing share prices last year helped SoftBank claw its way back into the black from a multibillion-dollar loss.</td>

Tampa Bay, meanwhile, gambled its fortunes on a 43-year-old quarterback in the hopes he still had the ability to beat the likes of Patrick Mahomes.<br />On Sunday night, Tom Brady did it—again. Brady and the Buccaneers are Super Bowl champions.<br />The Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, giving Brady his record seventh Super Bowl title in a battle of generational greats that saw Brady once again reaching the pinnacle of his sport and Mahomes laboring to stay upright.<br />While Mahomes, the reigning Super Bowl MVP and champion, struggled behind a decimated offensive line and his defense committed a series of costly penalties, Brady played his greatest hits. He threw touchdown passes to tight end Rob Gronkowski. He picked apart the Kansas City defense. He won it all once again when so many doubted he could.</td>

The prospect of an auto partnership had sent the Korean companies’ stocks soaring this year, igniting investor enthusiasm after both  Kia  and Hyundai had suffered years of slumping car sales.<br />Shares sank 6% for Hyundai Motor following Monday’s regulatory-filing disclosures, while Kia plunged by more than 13%.<br />Apple began seeking potential automotive partners late last year as it considers whether it can begin production of a vehicle as soon as 2024.

No sooner than it had said so, Seoul-based Hyundai tried to backtrack on the statement.</td>

      <td>Christopher Gang was hired in April 2020 as a software engineer at a health-care tech startup called Cured. Since college, he has done his best work late at night. In his new, fully remote role, with no office commute, he embraced this fact for the first time in his professional life.<br />“My sweet spot is 2 or 3 in the morning, but if I get into a flow state, I’ll just let myself stay up until 6 or 7 a.m.,” says the 24-year-old, who lives in Dallas. But he kept his night-owlishness to himself for about three months.<br />“Even if I was working late, I wouldn’t communicate that per se,” he says. He believes a stigma exists against late risers that can affect their professional standing. “But once I gained the trust of my manager, I was allowed to be more flexible.” Now he openly burns the midnight oil and doesn’t worry if his colleagues know.<br />In our age of remote work, many jobs have never been so untethered from the 9-to-5 paradigm. And a lot of night owls, who do their best work later in the day, are thriving.<br />But it’s not quite a 24/7 free-for-all. Many newly liberated late workers like Mr. Gang are navigating how to balance their habits with bosses and colleagues who work on more traditional daytime schedules. They’re also trying to avoid burnout themselves.</td>

Mr. Brindisi’s lawyers said they are appealing some of Justice DelConte’s rulings on which ballots should be counted, but the judge directed election officials to certify the results in the last unresolved U.S. House race in the country. Ms. Tenney has declared victory.<br />The court-supervised canvass revealed several irregularities in the county process, including unprocessed registration forms, misplaced ballots and votes cast by people who then died before Election Day.<br />Observers said it has already shown the need to rethink how New York administers elections and handles paper ballots, which were cast at an unprecedented number last year because of state policy changes prompted by the new coronavirus pandemic.</td>

He was 100 years old.<br />Mr. Shultz held four different cabinet posts in the Nixon and Reagan administrations and served for six years as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, one of the longest such tenures since World War II. He remained an active voice on national security, economic and environmental issues after leaving government, sometimes taking positions challenging the Trump administration.<br />A man of strong convictions who nevertheless rarely lost control of his emotions, Mr. Shultz played a pivotal role in encouraging Mr. Reagan to pursue a dialogue with the Soviet Union’s leaders despite strong opposition from the Pentagon and, at times, the president’s own national-security adviser.<br />“I always thought of Shultz as a stabilizer,” said John Lewis Gaddis, a Yale University professor and Cold War historian. “If you think of great ships going across the ocean, the captain sets the course, but somebody has to keep it on course.”<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken described Mr. Shultz as a champion of diplomacy who came to his post with enormous experience. “Every Secretary of State who came after George Shultz has studied him—his work, his judgment, his intellect. I know I have,” Mr. Blinken said. “It’s as distinguished a record of public service as any in American history.”</td>

      <td>Yield-hungry investors have been piling into riskier assets, and not only speculative stocks like  GameStop .  For an example of how negative real interest rates are distorting prices, behold the municipal bond market.<br />Last month investors snapped up $560 million in bonds issued by junk-rated Chicago Public Schools (CPS). The district’s 10-year bonds were priced at 1.94% and the 20-year at 2.24%—a mere 117 to 105 basis points above the AAA muni benchmark yields. As the district's finances have deteriorated, its borrowing costs have plunged. Go figure.<br />Five years ago Chicago schools had to pay an 8.5% yield—a 580 basis-point penalty above AAA—to sell debt amid concerns that soaring labor and pension costs would drive the district into bankruptcy. Asked at the time whether the district would be able to borrow again, then CPS CEO Forrest Claypool replied: “I don’t know.”<br />What a difference a pandemic and Federal Reserve commitment to keep rates at near zero make. Muni bonds are thinly traded and usually held in portfolio for duration. Most buyers need fixed-income assets that produce steady returns, which explains the ravenous appetite for higher-yielding muni bonds.<br />“Buyers are just starved for yield and the inflows into high-yield funds have been astronomical for at least the last couple of weeks,” one muni-market analyst explained to Bond Buyer. Increased demand has made it cheaper than ever for state and local governments to borrow and has compressed price spreads between high- and low-rated bonds.</td>

The agreement capped months of negotiations that had recently deteriorated to the point where the city was threatening to block Chicago teachers from logging into remote learning and the teachers were threatening to not show up for work.<br />On Friday, talks had reached an impasse after the city issued a “last, best and final offer,” with the two sides apparently heading toward a lockout and strike. Then talks unexpectedly resumed on Saturday.<br />“We are here to deliver the very good news that our children will be returning to in-person learning this week,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a media briefing Sunday. “This agreement was about making sure that everyone in our school communities aren’t just safe but also that they feel safe.”<br />The Chicago Teachers Union was more cautious in how it described the deal on Twitter.</td>

      <td>Democrats define bipartisanship as Pelosi agreeing with Schumer.</td>
      <td>When George W. Bush took office in 2001 with a Senate divided 50-50, he negotiated his first tax cut with Democrats that passed with 58 votes, including 11 Democrats. Democrats won tax-rebate checks and a delay in the tax-rate cuts for their efforts. This made the bill worse as economic policy, but Mr. Bush made the concessions rather than jam his bill through with only GOP votes.<br />That isn’t how President Biden is playing the politics of his $1.9 trillion spending bill in the current 50-50 Senate. Last week he made a show of listening at the White House to 10 GOP Senators who made an initial counteroffer of $618 billion. Mr. Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill then ignored the GOP and rammed a budget resolution for the $1.9 trillion through the Senate and House on a partisan vote. So much for bipartisanship.<br />The truth is that the Democrats refused even to negotiate. Instead they moved to pass the bill through a process known as budget reconciliation that skirts the 60-vote filibuster rule and requires only 50 votes plus Vice President Kamala Harris to pass. And that’s how it passed the Senate in the wee hours Friday morning, 51-50. It later passed the House, 219-209, with no Republicans in support.<br />It’s true the GOP used reconciliation twice in 2017 on health care and tax reform. But Democrats refused to negotiate on either one. The Resistance dictated that Democrats oppose all things Donald Trump. They didn’t even try to mitigate the reduction in the state-and-local tax deduction that most affected blue states like California. This time Mr. Biden has a specific GOP proposal he won’t even consider.<br />The Senate debate last week included a multitude of revealing amendments about the partisan Democratic strategy. Our favorite is the switcheroo by Senators Jon Tester (Montana) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.) on the Keystone XL pipeline. First they voted for a GOP amendment opposing Mr. Biden’s plan to shut down the pipeline that would provide thousands of high-paying energy jobs. But they later voted for a Democratic amendment at the end of the debate that passed 51-50 and erased that Keystone amendment. This is an instant Beltway swamp classic.</td>

House impeachment managers haven’t yet indicated whether there will be new witnesses in the trial, leaving its scope and duration up in the air, according to lawmakers and aides. Mr. Trump’s lawyers turned down a request for the former president to appear.<br />At the same time, Democrats are debating who should be eligible for $1,400 direct checks and whether they can pass a $15 minimum wage as part of the pandemic-related stimulus package.<br />“The Senate’s going to do all three things next week. We’re going to do our constitutional responsibility and hold a trial. It won’t last very long. We’re going to move forward nominees and we’re going to continue to push forward Covid-relief legislation,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) said on Fox News Sunday.</td>

      <td>The Super Bowl starts at the same time as every year: 6:30 p.m.</td>
      <td>This year’s Super Bowl on Feb. 7 (that’s today) between the Kansas City Chiefs and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, will begin at 6:30 p.m. ET. That shouldn’t come as a surprise. That’s the same time as last year and every year for the last decade.<br />The last time the Super Bowl wasn’t at 6:30 p.m. was in the distant time of 2010, before a radical shift brought it to its current slot. That year, the game was at 6:25 p.m., five minutes earlier than 6:30 p.m. In 2009, it was at 6 p.m. In 2008, it was at 6:17 p.m. On four occasions, it was even at 6:18 p.m. The NFL has dabbled in much experimentation during the six o’clock hour before finding the comfort of 6:30 p.m.<br />There are, however, some things about the big game that vary from year to year. That’s especially true in 2021 for an event that will look like never before with the country in the throes of a global pandemic. So here’s your quick guide to everything about the 55th Super Bowl, otherwise known as Super Bowl LV.<br />The Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. That’s especially exciting because of the teams’ two quarterbacks: Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady—the last two to win the Super Bowl.<br />Mahomes led the Chiefs to last year’s title. Brady has won six and this will be his 10th Super Bowl appearance. But the previous nine came with the New England Patriots, the team he left after last season. It’s a generational battle between the 43-year-old Brady and the 25-year-old Mahomes. One is toward the end of an all-time career. The other is at the beginning of one.</td>

      <td>President Harry Truman’s Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, called his memoir “Present at the Creation,” an account of rebuilding the postwar world and the realities of a Cold War with the Soviet Union. Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who died Saturday at age 100, titled his memoir “Turmoil and Triumph,” an apt description of the historic role Shultz played in ending the Cold War some 40 years later.<br />Shultz served as Ronald Reagan’s Secretary of State for almost the length of Reagan’s Presidency, from 1982 until 1989. The “turmoil” of his memoir’s title described the world as he took control of foreign policy for Reagan.<br />The Soviet Union, possessing a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons, was led by Yuri Andropov, a determined communist opponent of the West. Hard to believe now, but Europe then was still divided by what Winston Churchill called an “iron curtain,” which separated the free democratic nations of Western Europe from the closed, Soviet-dominated countries to the east. Millions were imprisoned inside these countries, unable to emigrate. Those who tried to flee could be imprisoned or shot.<br />The competition between the U.S. and Soviet Union was global, extending into Central America, the Middle East, East, East and Southeast Asia and Africa. Shultz, like Reagan, was determined to end the Cold War.<br />It was in some ways an unlikely role for Shultz, who earned his Ph.D. in industrial economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after serving in the Marine Corps during World War II. His thinking on economics later came to be associated with such free-market economists as Milton Friedman and Ronald Coase at the University of Chicago, where Shultz served as dean of the business school in the 1960s.</td>

We can and must prosecute the people responsible to the fullest extent of the law. But we shouldn’t grant those who failed to abrogate liberal democracy a partial victory by rushing to pass unnecessary “domestic antiterrorism” laws that would undermine civil liberties.<br />I understand the desire to respond to this outrageous act of insurrectionary violence. But I believe we shouldn’t rush into ill-considered actions that undermine our freedoms and do nothing to increase our security. That is why I was the only senator to vote against the USA Patriot Act in 2001 and why I oppose new domestic antiterrorism laws today.<br />History makes clear that these new powers are likely to be used predominantly against black and brown communities and progressives. Consider the Palmer Raids against socialists and union organizers during the first Red Scare in 1919-20, or J. Edgar Hoover’s “Cointelpro” assault on the civil-rights and antiwar movements of the 1960s, or the targeting of Muslim Americans in this century’s war on terror.<br />The overwhelming tendency in domestic antiterrorism has been to use invasive and unconstitutional surveillance techniques to criminalize legitimate dissent. In recent years, many states have continued the trend by passing laws that treat antipipeline protesters—often indigenous Americans—essentially as domestic terrorists and saboteurs, imposing harsh criminal penalties on activities protected by the First Amendment.<br />This history was a basis for the recent statement by 135 civil-rights and civil-liberties organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and the NAACP, in opposition to any new domestic terrorism laws. I am proud to echo their call.</td>

      <td>Supply is ramping up, but many Americans are reluctant to get the shot and need to be persuaded.</td>
      <td>The Food and Drug Administration announced new steps last week to help ensure that Covid-19 tests, treatments and vaccines stay ahead of new, potentially more transmissible and virulent, variants, whose emergence makes widespread vaccination even more urgent. The longer it takes to get the virus under control, the harder it may become. And soon, the problem may be a vaccine glut if demand is weaker than expected.<br />After early challenges, vaccine delivery is keeping up with supply. But by the end of March, the monthly vaccine supply may reach 100 million doses. To keep pace, the vaccination rate would have to double and then some. This will require an all-of-the-above approach to administering vaccines, tapping substantial capacity in pharmacies, primary-care practices and other trusted health-care providers.<br />Especially with improved delivery, at some point, perhaps in April, supply will start exceeding demand. The challenge won’t be how to ration a scarce resource, but how to reach patients reluctant to get vaccinated. Based on the latest Kaiser Family Foundation tracking surveys, more than half of Americans say they don’t want to get vaccinated. Some may simply want to wait; others may be set against getting it.<br />One reason for the hesitancy may be that it was necessary to ration scarce doses at the start, causing many Americans to internalize the idea that some people may be more likely to benefit or more deserving than others. It is essential to emphasize in public-health messaging that every adult can benefit and deserves the protections they can provide, and there will be no reason to forgo it once the scarcity problem is solved.<br />Government at every level should work with as many partners as possible to expand access. More Americans will take the vaccine if they can get it at a comfortable location. Not everyone will be willing or able to line up at Dodger Stadium. Insurers, pharmacies and large employers can assist public-health systems to reach people in every community.</td>

But use U.S. taxpayers’ resources to promote the termination of unborn life in poor countries, and progressives call it “health” spending. A similar language game is played when international socialists organize political factions under the banner of “democracy” to consolidate power.<br />Abortion and democratic socialism are two causes the Biden administration plans to champion in the Northern Triangle of Central America—Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Sovereignty, respect for local cultural norms, and the economic aspirations of millions of have-nots have never been high ideals in Washington. But now the condescending ideologues are resupplied. The problem is likely to get worse.<br />Latin Americans have reason to distrust President Biden, who had special responsibility for the region during the Obama administration. One notable disaster in that time was Colombia’s surrender to the narco-trafficking group FARC. The agreement was cooked up in Havana with U.S. help. Colombians rejected it in a referendum, but then-President Juan Manuel Santos pushed it through anyway, with backing from Team Obama.<br />FARC leaders got amnesty and unelected seats in Congress, but the agreement has been a disaster for the South American nation. The cocaine business has exploded anew, FARC honchos have been caught in drug deals, and coca-growing regions are again immersed in bloody conflict. The discredited Mr. Santos has been reduced to lobbying the U.S. to take Havana off its list of state sponsors of terrorism.<br />In Central America, Biden administration foreign-policy makers want to reproduce a version of the United Nations’ International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (a k a CIGIG) that would span all three countries in the Northern Triangle.</td>

      <td>Harry Reid made frequent use of the ﬁlibuster when he led the Senate. A former Reid staffer is shocked that GOP leaders have done the same.</td>
      <td>One thing Americans can probably agree on right now is that Americans don’t agree on much of anything. The divisions are reflected in a Senate split between 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats. This might seem like a moment for modesty, but one of the new Senate’s first debates was whether Democrats should move to end the filibuster and push their agenda through on a simple majority. (Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties.) The filibuster rule appears to have received a stay of execution: Two Democrats have indicated that they won’t lend the votes needed to abolish it.<br />But the debate will return. Progressives have launched a sustained assault on the filibuster as a racist anachronism that allows a minority of senators to hijack the will of the American public by holding up legislation until a supermajority of 60 votes can be mustered to end debate. That is the thesis of Adam Jentleson’s “Kill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of American Democracy.” The Senate, he writes, “has become a kill switch” that “shuts down our democratic process.” But his account of “the problems facing the Senate and, by extension, the nation” is backward: Many of the Senate’s dysfunctions are downstream from the country’s divisions. The filibuster is a convenient villain for larger progressive frustration with constitutional government.<br />Mr. Jentleson presents his argument in two parts. The first traces the history of the filibuster. The tactic is nowhere in the Constitution, he observes, and first emerged in the 19th century. In 1917, amid a fight over isolationism, the Senate adopted Rule XXII. It allowed senators “to call a vote to end debate—to tell the kids to wrap it up,” Mr. Jentleson writes, a process known as “cloture.”<br />He concedes that filibusters have “sometimes been deployed by liberals and progressives, and occasionally to historic effect” but have “mainly served to empower a minority of predominantly white conservatives to override our democratic system when they found themselves outnumbered.” He brings out the bazooka, calling Mitch McConnell one of the “modern acolytes” of slavery-defender John C. Calhoun. It is true that the filibuster allowed Southern Democrats to stall civil-rights legislation. It is also true that filibusters are now a commonplace of Senate life and are often used for tactical advantage at the expense of substance. But such uses are bipartisan. Democrats last year wouldn’t let debate begin on a police-reform bill by Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina.<br />Not so long ago, Democrats liked the filibuster. The practice is part of “the constitutional principles of checks and balances,” then-Sen. Harry Reid said in 2005, when filibustering George W. Bush’s judicial nominees was in vogue. Mr. Jentleson is a former aide to Mr. Reid, who as majority leader routinely shut down the Senate from taking votes of any consequence. You might say he ran the place with a kill switch.</td>

      <td>Small clinical trial found that it doesn’t appear to protect recipients against mild and moderate illness from a fast-spreading new strain of the coronavirus</td>
      <td>JOHANNESBURG—South Africa said Sunday it would temporarily halt a planned rollout of  AstraZeneca  PLC’s Covid-19 vaccine after a small clinical trial found that it doesn’t appear to protect recipients against mild and moderate illness from a fast-spreading new strain of the coronavirus first detected in the country.<br />The trial, which enrolled around 2,000 volunteers with a median age of 31 in South Africa, was too small and its participants too young to draw broad conclusions on the vaccine’s overall efficacy in protecting against the disease caused by the coronavirus, especially when it comes to hospitalizations or death. However, its findings contribute to concerns that a mutating virus is rendering existing Covid-19 vaccines less effective and that shots will need to be updated to protect against new virus strains.<br />Of the 39 volunteers in the AstraZeneca trial that were found to be infected with the new South African variant, 19 had received the vaccine, while 20 had received a placebo, said Shabir Madhi, the trial’s principal investigator and dean of the medical school at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Those numbers would imply an efficacy rate of around 10% at protecting against mild and moderate Covid-19 from the new variant, said Dr. Madhi, although he added that the data were too limited to be statistically significant.<br />After the results were announced, South Africa’s health minister, Zweli Mkhize, said the country would temporarily halt a planned rollout of the vaccine until there was more information on the vaccine’s efficacy. The country had planned to administer a first shipment of one million doses of the vaccine to health-care workers later this month.<br />Johnson & Johnson  and  Novavax Inc.,  whose vaccines have yet to be authorized in any country, have also found that their shots were less effective in recent human clinical trials in South Africa, compared with trials in the U.S. or the U.K. But their vaccines were still found to be 50% or more effective at preventing mild or moderate cases of Covid-19 and even more potent at shielding recipients from severe illness and hospitalization from the new strain.</td>

A clip of the interview was released Sunday morning. The full interview will run Sunday afternoon.<br />Asked by CBS News whether the U.S. will lift sanctions to convince Iran to participate in negotiations, Mr. Biden said, “No.” When CBS asked whether Iran must stop enriching uranium first, Mr. Biden nodded.<br />The Biden administration has previously said Iran must come into compliance with the 2015 agreement before sanctions will be lifted. “President Biden supports diplomacy to deal with the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear program, but he certainly isn’t going to offer sanctions relief just to get Iran back to the table, which is what the question suggested,” a White House official said on Sunday.<br />Before President Biden’s interview, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in a speech Sunday reiterated Iran’s stance that it is Washington that must lift sanctions and come back into compliance with the nuclear accord.</td>

      <td>From stimulus to school admissions, leaders act as if ease is the only worthy goal.</td>
      <td>Has an era of American mediocrity begun? In January the College Board announced it would eliminate the essay portion of the SAT, as well as all of the separate SAT subject tests. Their stated purpose was “reducing and simplifying demands on students.” Such a burden.<br />One high school near me just dropped freshman advanced-standing (honors) English “to combat the effects of academic ‘tracking” because it “ultimately separates students of different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds.” It turns out that middle schools from lower-income areas aren’t adequately preparing their students for high school. So rather than fix that problem, they dumbed down high school.<br />Then again, when the University of California system did away with racial preferences in 1996, it moved to holistic admissions. What does holistic mean? Anything you want. The Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities defines it as “assessing an applicant’s unique experiences alongside traditional measures of academic readiness.” Grades are only a suggestion—and SAT scores are biased, supposedly. And here you thought smart students got into good colleges. Yes, mediocrity has crept into our self-proclaimed elite colleges. Job recruiters understand this.<br />Virtually all universities and now many companies have D&I departments, for diversity and inclusion. Sounds worthy. But as far as I can tell, the No. 1 job of a D&I department is to hire more people into the D&I department. No one ever mentions excellence.<br />Many schools, like Hampshire College, Antioch University and Reed College, don’t even bother with meaningful grades—feelings might get hurt. Yes, the same Reed College  Apple  co-founder Steve Jobs attended for six months. He took courses in calligraphy, dance and Shakespeare. Reed students do receive a loosey-goosey grade-point average, but “papers and exams are generally returned to students with lengthy comments but without grades affixed.” Out in real life, Jobs was graded every day by customers, employees and investors.</td>

      <td>Removal from office is best understood as akin to a ‘mandatory minimum’ sentence for a crime.</td>
      <td>During the impeachment of Bill Clinton, his defenders argued that his misconduct was ultimately private and didn’t rise to the level of an impeachable offense. In the current impeachment of Donald Trump, that’s a hard argument to make with a straight face, since the then-president’s offenses, culminating in the siege of the Capitol, were obviously public and political. So his defenders claim instead that it’s unconstitutional for the Senate to try him now that he’s no longer in office.<br />Forty-five Republican senators voted in favor of Sen. Rand Paul‘s motion challenging the Senate’s jurisdiction to try Trump. But scholarship on this question has matured substantially since that vote, and it has exposed the serious weakness of Mr. Paul’s analysis.<br />The strongest argument against the Senate’s authority to try a former officer relies on Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution, which provides: “The president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” The trial’s opponents argue that because this provision requires removal, and because only incumbent officers can be removed, it follows that only incumbent officers can be impeached and tried.<br />But the provision cuts against their interpretation. It simply establishes what is known in criminal law as a “mandatory minimum” punishment: If an incumbent officeholder is convicted by a two-thirds vote of the Senate, he is removed from office as a matter of law.<br />If removal were the only punishment that could be imposed, the argument against trying former officers would be compelling. But it isn’t. Article I, Section 3 authorizes the Senate to impose an optional punishment on conviction: “disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.”</td>

      <td>Under current market conditions 50-year Treasuries are no panacea.</td>
      <td>In “Need Discount Debt? Try 50-Year Bonds” (op-ed, Jan. 29), Jon Hartley notes that the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee advised against issuing these bonds. He writes: “But its analysis missed how many long-term Treasurys could be bought up by defined-benefit pension funds looking for assets that match the duration (interest-rate risk) of their liabilities (payouts to pensioners in the future).” But doing so won’t help solve the main problem facing public and multiemployer defined-benefit pensions: underfunding.<br />The 50-year bonds would have to be purchased so that the amount of cash thrown off in the future is sufficient to pay the pension liabilities. Earning 2% will do nothing to achieve the 6%-7% returns that typical plans will require to curb underfunding.<br />A newly formed defined-benefit plan (a rarity, to be sure) could use 50-year Treasurys to achieve a fully funded, duration-matched plan, but would either have to promise much lower benefits to its retirees or make far higher contributions to the plan than typical existing plans do. The easiest way to grasp all this is to consider a fixed-dollar pension liability payable 50 years from now. If a 50-year Treasury strip (i.e., zero-coupon bond) existed, the plan could purchase this strip with a face value equal to the liability. The problem is that if the strips’s yield is, say, around 3%, the purchase cost will be far higher than if the strip yielded 6% or 7%. Reducing the amount purchased to reduce the cost will result in underfunding. Either way, under current market conditions 50-year Treasurys are no panacea.<br />Prof. Michael Stutzer<br />University of Colorado</td>

The 58-year-old former constitutional-law professor will lead eight other Democrats in seeking to persuade the Senate to convict Mr. Trump of inciting an insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />In a legal brief last week, Mr. Raskin alleged that Mr. Trump “created a powder keg” in which hundreds of people “were prepared for violence at his direction.” Mr. Trump’s lawyers have argued that Mr. Trump didn’t engage in insurrection, saying that he had “exercised his First Amendment right under the Constitution to express his belief that the election results were suspect” and that he hadn’t incited violence.<br />On Thursday, Mr. Raskin asked Mr. Trump to testify—a request that Mr. Trump’s lawyers shot down, calling it a “public relations stunt.” Mr. Trump’s brief is due on Monday.<br />Many Republicans have condemned Mr. Trump’s actions in telling a crowd amassed on the Ellipse to march to the Capitol and to “fight” to overturn Joe Biden’s November election victory, which was being certified in Congress that day. Some GOP senators have said they were open to convicting him.</td>

      <td>To broadcast Super Bowl LV in the Covid Age, the NFL had to rethink the game-day playbook. So this year, 30,000 life-size cutouts and a mere 25,000 fans—7,500 of whom are vaccinated health-care workers—will be in the stands at Tampa’s Raymond James Stadium (capacity: 65,618) to witness history.<br />But today’s spectacle involves far more than watching the showdown between the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The event promises some new faces in both the performances and the ads. The star-studded lineup includes country music’s Eric Church and R&B’s Jazmine Sullivan singing the national anthem, and Grammy-winning singer-songwriter H.E.R. performing “America the Beautiful.” The Weeknd, also a Grammy winner who now calls the Grammys “corrupt,” will headline the halftime show. And on the heels of her acclaimed Inauguration Day appearance, youth poet laureate Amanda Gorman will take the stage. Here are more insights on what to watch for during the big game:<br />Will any football actually be played amid all the superstar performances?<br />Yes, kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. eastern on CBS. The game will feature a quarterback matchup between Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady, his elder by almost 20 years, with the Bucs. This will be Brady’s 10th Super Bowl appearance, an NFL record. (If Tampa Bay wins on Sunday, Brady would become the first player ever to win seven NFL championships, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.)<br />These are tumultuous times. How will that be reflected on the field?</td>

      <td>Companies and entrepreneurs world-wide are working on more than 100 new small-rocket ventures, but industry officials anticipate a shakeout eventually may leave just a handful of survivors.<br />Some commercial boosters already have blasted satellites into space, supported by deep pockets and prominent backers such as  Lockheed Martin  Corp.  and British entrepreneur Richard Branson. Others are testing launchers using previous seed money and sometimes shoestring budgets. Still more projects in early development could hit a dead end, officials predict, because of potential funding shortfalls.<br />All competitors, though, confront the same market reality. Burgeoning corporate, civilian and military uses of compact satellites weighing under a ton—ranging from toaster-size models to versions resembling refrigerators—won’t generate enough demand to support the current glut of small launchers.<br />“Could the industry support 100 new launch companies? Of course not,” said Chuck Beames, chairman of small-satellite maker York Space Systems LLC and a former Pentagon space official who also chairs a trade association advocating for small spacecraft. He said a more realistic number would be four healthy small-rocket operators and several established companies flying larger commercial boosters.<br />The latter group, primarily targeting a different market segment of huge satellites headed into higher orbits, include Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Europe’s Arianespace SA and Blue Origin Federation LLC, run by  Amazon.com  Chief Executive Jeff Bezos. United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between  Boeing Co.  and Lockheed Martin, specializes in carrying large Pentagon satellites. For all of them, transporting small satellites is a secondary goal.</td>

Consumer spending hasn’t kept pace with the broader recovery in economic output. Debt levels, already a problem before the pandemic, grew at their fastest pace in more than a decade during the first nine months of 2020, while asset bubbles in stocks and real estate kept growing. China’s central bank faces a tricky balance between reining in stimulus without causing growth to sputter.<br />And now, a resurgence of Covid-19 infections in some parts of China, combined with a slow rollout of vaccines, is raising fresh worries about the outlook. At a minimum, Beijing’s plan to limit travel during the coming Lunar New Year, which falls on Feb. 12, will likely hit consumer spending, economists say.<br />All this matters because China is becoming a bigger part of the global economy, and a more important driver of growth world-wide. If its performance in 2021 disappoints, it could hurt everyone, from car brands to gadget makers to soybean farmers who are counting on Chinese demand.</td>

Unemployment fell and economic activity picked up much faster than expected. Unlike in previous recessions, equity and housing markets have done well.<br />All of those factors bolstered state and local revenues last year. But pandemic-related costs have soared in many localities, resulting in budget holes that may force states to cut back on other services, lay off workers or raise taxes, absent more federal aid. Policy analysts estimate state and local revenue losses due to the pandemic will total about $300 billion through fiscal year 2022, though that doesn’t include rising expenses.<br />State and local governments employ 18.6 million people, who provide services from collecting trash to teaching children. Democrats in Congress are pushing for $360 billion in aid to cities and states as part of President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, while many Republicans argue that would only encourage fiscal profligacy.</td>

To the west, a recently completed stretch of wall stops at their property line. To the east, the bustle of contractors moving dirt continued this past week around a partially built stretch of wall.<br />The family has been fighting the government’s efforts to seize a slice of the property via eminent domain and build a border wall that would leave the rest of the property cut off, on the fence’s south side. The family says it was likely one hearing away from having the government take possession of the land when President Biden took office.<br />Mr. Biden issued an executive order on his first day in office to stop construction of the border wall temporarily, while evaluating how to halt it permanently. The move followed Mr. Biden’s campaign promises to halt construction of the border wall—President Donald Trump’s signature campaign promise.<br />Stopping construction for good, however, is complicated. Sections of the wall are already partially built and federal money is already spent or appropriated for the wall. Construction of a border fence that started under President George W. Bush, for example, continued under President Barack Obama, who didn’t actively support it.<br />The Cavazoses are among hundreds of landowners in limbo as the Biden administration evaluates what to do next.</td>

Some CEOs said consumer activity could pick up as soon as spring. Others pointed to a recovery later in the year—or even 2022.<br />“Let me underscore that progress on economic growth is contingent on an effective vaccine rollout program globally,” said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO David Solomon. “In its absence, economic recovery will be unnecessarily delayed.”<br />The pandemic has unevenly bolstered and derailed growth prospects; divided workforces into staff able to shelter at home and those who must report in person for duty; and reshaped consumer purchasing as stay-at-home orders change. The rapid shifts have complicated financial forecasts and made consumer behavior hard to predict.<br />John Idol, CEO of Capri Holdings Ltd., which owns Versace and Michael Kors, said online luxury spending is strong but the near-term outlook is challenged because jumps in Covid-19 cases have caused additional restrictions and temporary store closures.</td>

That use of force risked putting average Russians who had gravitated to the movement on a dangerous path to confrontation with the Kremlin, said Leonid Volkov, one of Mr. Navalny’s top lieutenants.<br />“Tens of millions of people watched with horror as [Mr. Putin] showed he was ready to beat peaceful unarmed protesters with his storm troopers,” said Mr. Volkov in a video to supporters Thursday.</td>

Futures for West Texas Intermediate—or WTI, the main grade of U.S. crude—last week surpassed $55 a barrel for the first time in over a year.<br />The speed of the recovery has surprised some investors and analysts, given that coronavirus continues to curtail demand. It has juiced shares of companies including  Exxon Mobil Corp .  and  ConocoPhillips  after a troubled 2020 for oil-and-gas producers, making energy stocks the best performers on the S&P 500 this year.<br />“The market definitely has some momentum,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC, a hedge fund that invests in energy derivatives. “WTI is going to be targeting $60, too.”<br />Oil is rising against a mixed economic backdrop, with data published Friday suggesting that the labor market faces a long road to recovery. But the stock market continues to power higher, in part because investors expect a new dose of fiscal stimulus and vaccines to goose growth.</td>

      <td>Ease of transmission, new strains, limits of vaccination programs all mean Covid-19 will be around for years—and a big business</td>
      <td>Vaccination drives hold out the promise of curbing Covid-19, but governments and businesses are increasingly accepting what epidemiologists have long warned: The pathogen will circulate for years, or even decades, leaving society to coexist with Covid-19 much as it does with other endemic diseases like flu, measles, and HIV.<br />The ease with which the coronavirus spreads, the emergence of new strains and poor access to vaccines in large parts of the world mean Covid-19 could shift from a pandemic disease to an endemic one, implying lasting modifications to personal and societal behavior, epidemiologists say.<br />“Going through the five phases of grief, we need to come to the acceptance phase that our lives are not going to be the same,” said Thomas Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “I don’t think the world has really absorbed the fact that these are long-term changes.”<br />Endemic Covid-19 doesn’t necessarily mean continuing coronavirus restrictions, infectious-disease experts said, largely because vaccines are so effective at preventing severe disease and slashing hospitalizations and deaths. Hospitalizations have already fallen 30% in Israel after it vaccinated a third of its population. Deaths there are expected to plummet in weeks ahead.<br />But some organizations are planning for a long-term future in which prevention methods such as masking, good ventilation and testing continue in some form. Meanwhile, a new and potentially lucrative Covid-19 industry is emerging quickly, as businesses invest in goods and services such as air-quality monitoring, filters, diagnostic kits and new treatments.</td>

One of the core principles of market regulation in the U.S. is transparency—give investors information and let them decide. The GameStop drama was nothing if not transparent.<br />“You can sell garbage to the public as long as you say to the public, ‘This is garbage and you’d be an idiot to buy it, but would you like to buy it?’” said Harvey Pitt, a former SEC chairman.<br />What appears to have happened in recent weeks is that a massive wave of retail investors answered, “Yes,” to that question, current and former policy makers say. Fueled by social-media platforms like Reddit and smartphone brokerage apps like Robinhood, the traders bid up the price of GameStop to $483 a share from less than $18 a share three weeks earlier. The struggling videogame retailer closed Friday at $63.77, down 87% from its intraday peak on Jan. 28.</td>

They shouted, “release our leaders,” and wore red T-shirts and headbands—the color associated with her party.

      <td>Drinking is on the rise as a response to stress, but a growing number of people are choosing to give up alcohol before it becomes a problem</td>
      <td>Back in mid-March, as schools and businesses began to close and people headed home to hunker down, Amanda, a 44-year-old yoga instructor in Portland, Maine (who asked that her real name not be used for privacy reasons), decided to address one of the many worries that had begun to consume her day. “And that was whether I was drinking too much,” she says. Already, friends who suddenly had more time on their hands were ending their work days at 4 p.m. with a glass of wine or breaking out the “good tequila” on a Tuesday just to have “something to look forward to.”<br />Several studies conducted last fall determined that binge drinking has increased during the pandemic. A study of more than 1,500 adults published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in September found that the frequency of alcohol consumption increased 14% over the previous year for all adults. For women, binge drinking went up a whopping 41%.<br />Amanda wasn’t a problem drinker, but she worried that she could easily become one during the pandemic. “Removing the option entirely felt far easier than expecting myself to moderate, given all that was going on,” she says. She’s part of a growing number of people inspired by the pandemic to adopt a sort of preemptive sobriety. In July, a survey of 2,000 people commissioned by the addiction-awareness group Alcohol Change UK found that 7% of participants had stopped drinking completely during the lockdown.<br />The alcohol-alternative beverage market, meanwhile, has exploded and is now expected to exceed $29 billion by 2026. Jen Batchelor, the cofounder of Kin Euphorics, a line of non-alcoholic drinks, says that sales of their most popular canned cocktail, Kin Spritz, have quadrupled during the pandemic. “People are recognizing they don’t want to poison their power supply while the state of the world is what it is,” says Ms. Batchelor. “They want to maintain their agency at a time that’s already mood roulette. But the mentality is not, ‘I kicked alcohol.’ It’s ‘I shifted away from alcohol.’ It’s a choice, rather than what we often think of as a necessity, someone’s need to stop drinking—or else.”<br />“I think a lot of people are coming at sobriety from a fresh, modern, data-driven lens these days, where it’s so easy to measure the inputs in your life and what variables make you feel a different way—what affects your sleep, your hydration, your mindfulness,” says Bill Shufelt, co-founder and CEO of Athletic Brewing Company, a nonalcoholic craft brewery whose 2020 sales were up more than 500% over the year before. “And I think isolation and being in their houses has especially helped people identify the variables that are making them feel better or worse.”</td>

With millions of professionals doing their jobs at home, improving digital documents became more urgent for Mr. Narayen. So did adding and refining features so people could better collaborate while working remotely.<br />“Everybody going digital was not going to come again,” he said.<br />To lead in a crisis, Mr. Narayen said, managers must give people permission to stop doing projects not deemed essential for the moment, while also changing how work is done. Adobe has made efforts to not host meetings before 9 a.m., for example, and to regularly give employees additional time off on some Fridays so that they can relax and spend time with their families. “These are different times,” he said. “It’s not business as usual.”<br />Mr. Narayen, who became CEO in 2007, is one of the longest serving chieftains in the technology world. In 2013 Adobe said it would stop selling boxed versions of its software and instead directed customers to cloud-based subscriptions, embracing such a transformation before many other industry giants did. Adobe’s revenue rose to a record $12.87 billion in the 2020 fiscal year; this year the company expects revenue will surpass $15 billion. It now employs roughly 22,500 people.</td>

      <td>Andy Jassy is taking over a very unusual “tech” company.<br />Amazon  has many times more employees than any of its competitors, such as Microsoft, Google and Apple, and many are low-skilled manual laborers, rather than software engineers. Amazon is also a partner with approximately 2.4 million active marketplace sellers, who generate the majority of sales on its retail platform. But the incoming chief executive, Mr. Jassy—a loyal deputy and devoted student of founder Jeff Bezos—has at his disposal a powerful tool for managing such a vast ocean of workers and partners: an equally vast cloud-software infrastructure that he has overseen from its start.<br />Amazon uses software to manage in a way that’s unlike almost any other company, except maybe gig-economy giants Uber,  Lyft ,   DoorDash  and Instacart. Whether they’re driving a delivery van, picking items from shelves or trying to maintain their product inventory to avoid being delisted, Amazon’s employees, subcontractors and seller-partners are monitored, evaluated, rewarded and even flagged for reprimand or coaching by software.<br />While Mr. Jassy is often described by those who have worked for him as being a lot like Jeff Bezos, but perhaps warmer and fuzzier, there is arguably at present a sharp contrast between the way he treats his immediate reports and the way Amazon’s algorithms and artificial intelligence treat its millions of front-line workers and marketplace sellers. If Mr. Jassy can figure out how to use algorithms to manage workers and partners as humanely as he apparently manages the people he works with personally, that may prove to be his defining legacy as CEO.<br />Having built Amazon Web Services from a tiny startup he headed within Amazon, begun in the early 2000s, into the behemoth of the cloud market (and generator of half of Amazon’s profits), Mr. Jassy understands not only the internet plumbing for countless tech companies AWS supports, from  Netflix  to Slack, but also how it’s plugged into the myriad businesses owned by Amazon itself. Now 53 years old, Mr. Jassy joined Amazon in 1997, immediately after graduating from Harvard Business School.</td>

      <td>The tech industry’s titans were already huge before Covid-19, the subject of soaring valuations and snowballing antitrust investigations. The pandemic has only made them bigger. A lot bigger.<br />In almost every facet of life—the tools we use to work, study, and play; how we shop and interact; the way companies operate and market their products—people and businesses have become more reliant on technology over the past year. Even amid one of the most punishing economic downturns on record, spending surged on computers, videogames, online retail, cloud-computing services and digital advertising.<br />The result was dizzying growth for some of the largest corporations in history—and for their stock prices. At a time when companies such as airlines and bricks-and-mortar retailers struggled to survive, combined revenue for the five biggest U.S. tech companies— Apple Inc.,   Microsoft Corp. ,  Amazon.com Inc.,  Google-parent Alphabet Inc., and  Facebook Inc. —grew by a fifth, to $1.1 trillion. Their aggregate profit rose an even faster 24%. And their combined market capitalization soared by half over the past year to a staggering $8 trillion.<br />Their economic sway expanded in other ways, too, including employment: Amazon alone added 500,000 new workers in a single year, roughly equivalent to the entire population of Atlanta.<br />Lawmakers and regulators may yet find ways to rein them in, but the economic and societal forces propelling Big Tech to even higher heights seem likely to outlast Covid-19. Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella has said that he expects spending on technology to double to 10% of gross domestic product from its current level of 5%. This month he said he now expects that to happen even faster.</td>

Kids will say they understand the difference between games and real life. And besides, they’ll argue, these popular games are cartoonish—cute, even.<br />Do the children know best here? If so, why do parents still have a nagging suspicion that these games are harmful in some insidious way?<br />Decades of research haven’t established a firm link between violence committed in games and violence committed in real life. Yet questions persist about the subtle effects that violent games have on developing minds. The questions have become more pressing as the pandemic drags on. U.S. consumers spent nearly $19 billion on videogames in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 26% increase from the prior-year period, according to the NPD Group. “Fortnite” and “Minecraft” were among the best-selling games in the quarter.<br />On the one hand, videogames have been a saving grace during a time of little other social interaction. Yet we still worry about how all of this time spent shooting, stabbing and bludgeoning friends, strangers and bots alike will affect kids.</td>

Japanese restaurants say the demand is helping them to stay afloat, and to reach new customers through delivery and to-go options. The number of sushi restaurants open in the U.S. grew by 5% last year as numbers for steakhouses and Italian restaurants fell, according to online-directory  Yelp .<br />Kaho Lo, a 40-year-old software engineer from San Jose, Calif., used to get sushi weekly at his  Adobe Inc.  office cafeteria.

Sales at restaurants and bars of $659 billion last year were down by nearly a quarter from 2019, according to National Restaurant Association estimates, and more than 110,000 bars and restaurants closed at least temporarily.

      <td>An iceberg that had been the world’s largest is now breaking into pieces close to the island of South Georgia in the South Atlantic.<br />Scientists had worried about the impact on the remote island’s wildlife if the berg had grounded on its continental shelf. Salinity levels and water levels would have caused sweeping changes to the ecosystem, while plants and animals on the sea bed might have been crushed if the berg—once the size of Jamaica—had been borne ashore by the strong South Atlantic currents.<br />Then there was the matter of the penguins.<br />Ecologists feared that the island’s huge colonies of king and gentoo penguins would have to make large detours to reach their usual hunting grounds, with potentially dire consequences for chicks waiting back onshore.<br />Instead, more than three years after calving off Antarctica’s Larsen C Ice Shelf some 930 miles to the south, warmer waters and the torque of the currents have shattered the behemoth into a dozen pieces, now known as A68b, A68c, and so on under the U.S. National Ice Center’s naming system. They now appear set to drift north, where they might prove a bigger problem for humans.</td>

      <td>The recent hubbub over Mary-Kate Olsen’s recent Zoom-divorce outfit recalls the courtroom drama of Marilyn Monroe and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Non-celebrities are upping the glamour quotient on their own divorce style, too.</td>
      <td>Off Brand is a thrice-monthly column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />WEDDING OUTFITS get all the attention—from bespoke suits to custom gowns to unconventional but no less strategized statements like jumpsuits, Army uniforms and Renaissance Fair costumes.<br />But wedding style’s evil stepsister, the divorce look, is gaining clout in the zeitgeist. When child-star-turned-fashion-mogul Mary-Kate Olsen and French banker Olivier Sarkozy finalized their divorce last month via Zoom, screenshots of the proceedings taken by court reporters went viral. Ms. Olsen, whose brand the Row epitomizes quiet sophistication, wore a chic black turtleneck that was instantly dissected and memed. With her long wavy hair unkempt in a relatable pandemic-ish way, she looked uniquely herself. And was that a hint of a smile?<br />The enthusiastic online response to the screenshot evoked the glory days of Hollywood divorce, when plebes watched awestruck as stars like Elizabeth Taylor (eight marriages) and Zsa Zsa Gabor (nine marriages) made serial break-ups glamorous. When Marilyn Monroe divorced Joe DiMaggio in 1954 after nine months of marriage, she famously wore a little black dress, high pumps and white gloves to the courthouse. She was filmed beaming and waving outside its chambers—a scene that would have fit seamlessly into one of her movies.<br />No one formula prescribes what to wear to one’s divorce proceedings, whether they take the form of mediation, litigation, or, now, a video call. Yet few would deny that one’s appearance plays a role in the outcome, with so much at stake: money, home, custody. The websites of family-law practices often include lengthy treatises advising men and women on what to wear to court, with the emphasis on classic silk blouses, prim dresses and sober suits. Some firms go further: Claire Samuels Law, a family law and divorce mediation firm in Charlotte, N.C., offers the services of a high-end stylist, and posts style ideas such as Prada pumps and minimalist Valextra handbags to its Instagram account.</td>

      <td>A MoMA exhibit explores the ways European art movements of the 1920s and ‘30s responded to and furthered the social and political upheaval of the time.</td>
      <td>New York<br /><br />These days when modernism is coupled with “utopian” or “idealistic,” it’s with a disparaging tone meant to emphasize the naïveté of the idea. Yet in the early 20th century, in a society transformed by the Russian Revolution and World War I, modernism seemed to embody hope for a better future and to repudiate a problematic past. For many artists, a new pared-down aesthetic and a bold, experimental embrace of the latest technologies, materials and techniques aptly expressed the aspirations of a startlingly altered world.<br />“Engineer, Agitator, Constructor: The Artist Reinvented,” at the Museum of Modern Art, explores the ways, in the 1920s and ’30s, adventurous art was put into the service of politics and social change in Soviet Russia, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and elsewhere in Europe. Russian Constructivism, De Stijl, the Bauhaus, Futurism, and Dada are all represented by posters, advertisements, magazine layouts, books, typography, films, broadsides, theater design, and just plain propaganda, sparsely punctuated by paintings and prints that provide welcome refreshment from the commercial inclusions. Much of the exhibition celebrates the 2018 gift of more than 300 early 20th-century works on paper from the Merrill C. Berman collection, with selections of similarly “functional” works from MoMA’s holdings.<br />We are reminded that after the cataclysms of revolution and war, some artists began to question not only the nature of what they did, but also its necessity. The pragmatic dominated. We learn that the Latvian graphic designer Gustav Klutsis posited an “artist of an entirely new type”—“a public person, a specialist in political and cultural work with the masses”—while the Russian painter Liubov Popova, who said she desired “to translate the aesthetic to the production plane,” abandoned the easel for agitprop theater sets, costume design, and other useful projects. (A couple of abstract, colored linoleum cuts, with bold jostling planes, make us wish she hadn’t.)</td>

A man was arrested outside of London Luton Airport in late January in connection with the sale of bogus Covid-19 test certificates.<br />In November, French authorities arrested seven people for selling false certificates to travelers at Charles de Gaulle Airport, near Paris. Police first got wind of the fraud after discovering a passenger with a fake certificate on a flight to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. After the arrests, police found on the suspects’ phones more than 200 fake certificates, which allowed people to fly internationally, according to French prosecutors.</td>

Chief Executive Elon Musk, is suddenly worth a total of more than $6 billion.<br />It is called dogecoin, a homage to bitcoin that was designed to serve no real purpose. Dogecoin holders can’t buy much with it and can’t easily convert it to cash. For most of its life, the virtual currency has traded for no reason other than to generate online laughs.<br />Dogecoin is named after an internet meme that surfaced nearly a decade ago. The meme centered around an image of a Shiba Inu dog with bad spelling habits (thus doge instead of dog). Users Photoshopped the dog’s furry face onto everything from astronauts to Twinkies.<br />In 2013, the software developer Billy Markus was watching bitcoin gain in popularity and decided to make his own lighthearted cryptocurrency. He first based it on the videogame “Animal Crossing,” and called it bells, named after the game’s pretend currency.<br />People online hated it, he said. So when another developer, Jackson Palmer, shared a new idea for a cryptocurrency based on the doge meme, Mr. Markus reconfigured his code for bells to fit the meme.</td>

Eventually, though, the Dutch took the tulip trade to the next level, as the 19th century writer Charles Mackay points out in his book “Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.” The people of 17th century Holland were no strangers to markets and trade. The stock exchange in Amsterdam had been operating since 1602, and the Dutch East India Company was already selling bonds and stocks.<br />Limited supply, plus an appetite for rare bulbs, made prices skyrocket. At one point, a single rare bulb could be exchanged for dozens of items, including oxen, swine and sheep, according to Mr. Mackay. The bulb market reached its peak in 1636 and 1637 before collapsing, pushing some investors into financial ruin.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The size of your next stimulus check might depend on when you file your tax return.<br />For many Americans, income in 2020 was lower than it was in 2019 because of the pandemic-induced recession. And because the stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person will have limits based on household income, it matters which year the payments are based on.<br />So why would it matter when you file your tax return? That’s because Congress is likely to tell the IRS to use 2019 or 2020 income—whichever the government has when the payment is made, according to the Senate Finance Committee.<br />Those who file soon after the Internal Revenue Service starts accepting returns on Feb. 12 will likely have their payments based on 2020 income and family size. Those who wait would have their payments based on 2019 income and family size.<br />“If it’s filed electronically, it’s processed almost immediately, and the information is then available to the IRS almost instantaneously,” said David Kautter, who was the top tax-policy official at the Treasury Department during the first two rounds of payments.</td>

Police in riot gear were deployed in large numbers and trucks with water cannons were present in the area, raising fears of a crackdown.<br />The coup took place in the early hours of Monday, when soldiers raided the homes of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other officials ahead of a new session of parliament. Ms. Suu Kyi’s party had trounced its military-backed opponents by a big margin in national elections in November. The military said it was taking control because election officials didn’t address its complaints about fraud involving the country’s voter lists.<br />Ms. Suu Kyi remains detained in her house in the nation’s capital. Political activists and a number of her key aides are also detained. The U.S. and many other foreign governments have condemned the takeover and asked the army to reverse course.<br />The military, or Tatmadaw as it is known in Myanmar, has been in control for most of the past 73 years since the country won independence from British colonial rule. It began a celebrated shift toward democracy a decade ago but that process ended abruptly this week. The military has a history of violent crackdowns against pro-democracy demonstrators.</td>

      <td>First, George Washington and Abe Lincoln get the boot as school names. Now academic achievement will soon be history. The progressive beat goes on in San Francisco, where the school board next week is expected to consider a resolution abolishing merit exams and high grade point averages for admission to Lowell High School.<br />Named for 19th-century poet and abolitionist James Russell Lowell, the school is a nationally known beacon of excellence. Lowell is also among the 44 schools whose names the school board recently voted to change because Lowell’s references to African-Americans are regarded as insufficiently enlightened by today’s standards.<br />One school board commissioner, Alison Collins, has called merit-based admissions “racist.” The real problem progressives have with Lowell is that too many Asian-Americans are passing the entrance exam. But it’s perverse to penalize Asian-Americans because other children do less well on tests.<br />That’s especially true in a public school system that does such a poor job teaching children of color at most of its schools. Last year the nonprofit Brightbeam put out a report called “The Secret Shame: How America’s Most Progressive Cities Betray Their Commitment to Educational Opportunity for All.” The report says that in San Francisco “70% of white students are proficient in math, compared to only 12% of black students reaching proficiency—a 58-point gap.”<br />The underperformance of black and Latino children in so many American public schools should be a national scandal. Instead, the response from elite universities and New York City’s high-performing public schools has been to disguise the problem by setting de facto admissions quotas for Asian-American students no matter their superior qualifications.</td>

Other parents who have been sentenced in the case received sentences ranging from probation to nine months in prison.</td>

      <td>Materials were found at sites where Iran had blocked inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency</td>
      <td>BRUSSELS—United Nations inspectors have found new evidence of undeclared nuclear activities in Iran, according to three diplomats briefed on the discovery, raising new questions about the scope of the country’s atomic ambitions.<br />Samples taken from two sites during inspections in the fall by the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency contained traces of radioactive material, the diplomats said, that could indicate Iran has undertaken work on nuclear weapons, based on where it was found. The diplomats said they didn’t know the exact nature of what was found.<br />Last year, Iran blocked IAEA inspectors from checking the sites involved for seven months, leading to a standoff. Tehran has long denied that it has sought to make an atomic bomb and said all of its nuclear work is for peaceful purposes such as power generation and health care. There was no immediate comment from Iran on the findings.<br />In recent months, Iran has scaled up its nuclear activities, breaching many of the limits in the 2015 nuclear agreement it sealed with the U.S., European powers, Russia and China. These moves started over a year after the Trump administration exited the deal in May 2018 and then imposed broad sanctions on Iran, which had been lifted under the agreement.<br />It has also threatened to restrict IAEA inspectors’ access to sites later this month. These steps have caused growing concern in Washington about Iran’s nuclear intentions.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden, facing dim chances of winning many Republican votes in Congress for his Covid-19 relief package, is turning to a time-tested White House strategy: pitch the policy to voters of both parties instead.<br />The White House has been touting polling data showing that Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion proposal is broadly popular with Americans, including a Quinnipiac survey showing 68% support nationally. “This IS a bipartisan agenda,” chief of staff Ron Klain said on  Twitter .  Meanwhile, top White House aides have pitched the plan in hundreds of meetings with mayors, local elected officials, unions and business associations and participated in national and local television interviews.<br />Mr. Biden on Friday met with Democratic lawmakers, who had moved forward with a process that would allow them to pass a relief package with no Republican votes. The president later said in televised remarks that while he would like Republican support for his bill, he didn’t think GOP lawmakers were willing to do enough to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Some congressional Republicans balked at the White House pointing to national polls to call its plan bipartisan, as Democrats prepare to pass it along party lines.<br />“I think the idea that they’re claiming that as evidence of bipartisanship shows you how desperate they are for a fig leaf that they are doing something bipartisan,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy, (R., LA), who was among a group of 10 Republicans who met with Mr. Biden at the White House Monday.</td>

      <td>Biden wants twice the spending of 2009, though the economy is far stronger now.</td>
      <td>Democratic economist Larry Summers and former GOP Senator and economist Phil Gramm don’t agree on much. But when they do, it’s probably worth paying attention. Now they’re both warning that President Biden’s $1.9 trillion spending plan may carry more risks than benefits.<br />Mr. Gramm made the case in our pages this week, and Mr. Summers in the Washington Post on Friday. Their economic vantage points are different, but they both suggest that the Biden bill’s focus on spending so much at the current moment to boost consumer demand is misplaced. The economic data increasingly backs them up.<br />That’s true despite Friday’s report that the economy added a disappointing 49,000 new jobs in January. The jobs report undershot expectations, but the details show that most of the damage to the labor market comes from state lockdowns and supply constraints. Payrolls were revised downward by a combined 159,000 for November and December as states shut down businesses.<br />Manufacturing employment declined by 10,000 in January amid shortages of components and workers. Some have hauled in office workers to run their assembly lines. Notably, the average work week for all private and manufacturing employees increased by 0.3 hours as businesses utilized their workers more.<br />Especially striking were the job losses in nursing homes (31,000), home-health care (13,100), transportation and warehousing (27,800), general merchandise stores (30,500) and online retail (14,800). Employers in these industries are desperate to hire, which Congress made harder by reinstating the $300 per week in enhanced jobless benefits through mid-March. Most low-income workers can make more unemployed.</td>

      <td>Big business has helped Americans weather the pandemic. Retailers stayed open, tech firms made remote work possible, and the pharmaceutical industry is cranking out vaccines. So why did satisfaction with the “size and influence of major corporations” fall 15 points in this year's annual Gallup poll to a mere 26%?<br />The collapse came not among Democrats, whose skeptical views were virtually unchanged, but among Republicans. In 2020, 57% of Republicans said they were satisfied with big business. This year the number plummeted to 31%. The likely reason, as NBC’s Alex Seitz-Wald points out, is “the culture war reaching the C-suite.”<br />Put differently, many Fortune 500 firms took the Black Lives Matter protests as an opportunity to pivot hard to the left, ostentatiously endorsing protests even as they sometimes turned violent. Companies from  Amazon  to  Nike  donated large sums to progressive activist groups. Managers started to assign polarizing left-wing political texts to employees and adopted new racial hiring preferences. Brands like  Coca-Cola  and Eddie Bauer boycotted  Facebook  to try to pressure it to clamp down on political speech.<br />All of this did not pass without notice by Americans. Companies weren’t merely donating to their favored political candidates—they’ve done that for decades. They were bypassing the political process and intervening directly to transform highly contested parts of American life.<br />The firms believe this is good business, and affluent progressive consumers cheer the new political model. But everyone still gets one vote in elections, and the business community may be making a mistake by aggressively antagonizing the very Americans it has long relied on to protect it from government control.</td>

      <td>Republicans push education bills to give parents options.</td>
      <td>The Biden Administration seems committed to indulging teachers unions that oppose charter and private schools. But the more important political action may be outside of Washington, as Republicans in more than a dozen states have responded to parental frustration with school closures by introducing legislation to expand education choice.<br />Last week the Iowa Senate passed a bill to provide students assigned to low-performing public schools with education savings accounts (ESAs), which are similar to vouchers but can also be used for textbooks, tutoring and more. Parents can roll over unused funds to future years.<br />The legislation would also allow charter schools that are independent of local school districts; today the state has only two charter schools. The bill increases a tuition-and-textbook tax credit from a maximum of $250 to $1,000 per student and extends the credit to home schoolers. “If there’s one thing the pandemic has taught us about education, it’s that our parents need choice. And it’s not just in-person versus virtual,” said Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds.<br />Florida Republican state Sen. Manny Diaz has introduced a bill to consolidate the state’s current scholarship programs into taxpayer-funded ESAs. Nearly 200,000 students participate in the state’s existing programs, only one of which uses ESAs. The ESAs would give parents more flexibility in how they use the money.<br />A GOP state Senator in Arizona is proposing to expand eligibility for the state’s ESAs—which are currently used by fewer than 10,000 students in a set of narrow categories—to low-income students across the state. Republicans in New Hampshire and Missouri are also moving ESA bills. Nebraska legislators are debating a new tax-credit scholarship program, and Republicans in Arizona are pushing to expand the aggregate cap for the state’s tax-credit scholarship program to $20 million from $5 million over three years.</td>

      <td>A scandal within Baltimore’s police culture revealed a cancer of criminal activity. Could it be rooted out?</td>
      <td>Toward the end of crime reporter Justin Fenton’s account of the catastrophic reign of a Baltimore police unit that became synonymous with law-enforcement corruption and brutality, BPD detective Ryan Guinn touches on a paradox many of his colleagues see at the heart of police work. Speaking of another officer’s brazen disregard for the law, Mr. Guinn protests: “He cut corners—yeah, what cop doesn’t cut corners? Show me a cop who goes A-to-Z and hits every letter in their investigation. With the pressure we’re put under to produce?”<br />The nexus between the “pressure” brought by civic leaders clamoring for an answer to gun violence, and the less lofty realities of the practical world of policing comes into focus in the story of one notorious team’s origins and descent into infamy, as told by a longtime journalist for the Baltimore Sun. Mr. Fenton’s “We Own This City” is the tale of the Gun Trace Task Force, founded in 2007 as a well-meaning initiative that would target the distributors and straw purchasers responsible for flooding Baltimore streets with guns. “We were like one big unit,” recalled Mr. Guinn, a founding member of the GTTF, “and we went everywhere.”<br />A few paragraphs into reading “We Own This City,” I had the distinct sensation that I’d read this story before. A quick search confirmed that sensation: The same events were the subject of “I Got A Monster,” by former Baltimore City Paper editor-in-chief Brandon Soderberg and freelance journalist Baynard Woods, published just seven months before Mr. Fenton’s. Both books chronicle the rise and fall of a Baltimore police unit so riddled with corruption that several of its members are currently serving long prison sentences after multiple trials that began in 2017. Both rely on many of the same kinds of sources: direct interviews by the writers, court documents, transcripts of federal wiretaps, and other public records. Both let the narrative unfold and the actions of its principals (mostly) speak for themselves. But where “I Got A Monster” preoccupied itself with telling a fast-paced story of policing gone bad, “We Own This City” takes its time, unspooling the history of the Gun Trace Task Force. Mr. Fenton is after more than the portrait of a few malcontents.<br />From its inception, the Task Force’s approach was supposed to be more measured and deliberate than the usual unsystematic approach to curbing violence, and for some time, it seemed to work: 268 guns were seized in the task force’s first year from just 41 arrests. Then a new commander changed the GTTF’s focus to more “street rips”—arrests of individuals suspected of possessing illegal firearms—and higher quotas, and the unit cut its personnel by more than half. And when BPD detective Wayne Jenkins moved into the unit, the possibility for graft and corruption increased by orders of magnitude.<br />Mr. Jenkins, as Mr. Fenton reports, was one of the more blatant examples of dirty cops firmly supported by the system. Complaints that he planted drugs, took money forfeited from drug seizures and committed physical assault led to civil lawsuits and criminal charges, but almost all resulted in acquittals. (One lawsuit did find Mr. Jenkins liable—for a single dollar.) “Nobody could tell him nothing,” said one cop. “He would not listen to anybody.” Mr. Jenkins was the one doing the telling, “like he would sit us down and have miniclasses, give us scenarios, see what we would do and show us how to do it and not get caught.”</td>

      <td>No arguing the merits of the keto diet, a successful approach for some to modify symptoms of obesity and other diseases (“What if Meat Is Our Healthiest Diet?,” Review, Jan. 30). Where Gary Taubes gets it wrong is his lack of regard for the nutritional value of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, lumping them in the same category of processed foods because they contain carbohydrates. Obesity and Type II diabetes became a national crisis over the last three decades, when we have seen an increase in obesity prevalence in all age groups, revealing that the cause isn’t singularly genetic in nature. Humans have survived and thrived on diets of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables (with or without red meat) for millennia without a high prevalence of obesity. Lifestyle, food preparation and the environment in which we live are primary culprits in the obesity crisis, not carbohydrates from whole foods. Current research tells us there is no magic bullet to treat obesity. To serve future generations who have not yet realized the challenges of obesity, research efforts need to focus on prevention of obesity, starting in early childhood when eating habits are established.<br />Andrea Bushaw, Ph.D., APRN, CPNP<br />Edina, Minn.<br />Mr. Taubes misses something important because he doesn’t consider what animal-protein diets look like in traditional societies around the world. In many traditional herding and pastoral societies that were or are dependent on animals for food—for example, among Dinka cattle herders or Sami reindeer herders—people rely more on milk and blood products than animal flesh, eating animal flesh only occasionally, usually on feast and celebration days.<br />Even in pastoral societies where primarily the flesh of the animal is eaten, meat is typically eaten much less often than in industrialized societies like ours, where it’s so easy to walk into a store and buy a steak or roast. People also make full use of every carcass in a way that most meat eaters in the U.S. do not, eating all organs, using the skin and boiling bones to make stock.</td>

Regulations have supported this structure on the theory that small investors need to be protected from risk.<br />The challenge is that to protect one from risk also prevents one from gains. There are no such things as slam-dunk investments, and all bets can go down. To limit investors’ exposure to risk is to impede their ability to create wealth—something that should be easier than ever before given the market knowledge and access provided by modern technology.<br />Small investors made their voices heard, using the internet to force hedge funds into a short squeeze. Score one for the little guys. Is it a turning of the tides or a blip in the radar of the capital markets? That will depend on these increasingly empowered investors and how they continue to advocate for their interests in the public markets, message forums and everywhere in between.<br />Jason Frishman</td>

      <td>Regarding the letters “Taiwan Defense: A Hard Problem for the U.S.” (Feb. 2) responding to Elbridge Colby’s “America Can Defend Taiwan” (op-ed, Jan. 27): Mr. Colby rightly argues that Taiwan’s defense is an obligation which should be explicitly recognized as such and that the U.S. can meet the challenge.<br />I would merely add that “a hard problem for the U.S.” would be much less hard if Taiwan could reliably outnumber any invading force, by adopting the Finnish model of universal (very) short-service conscription for (very) intensive training followed by placement in a ready reserve, with occasional refreshers. Unlike today’s forces whose major weapons and headquarters are highly vulnerable to missile attack, small units armed with man-portable missiles distributed throughout the island would survive to outnumber (by far) the maximum total of potential invaders. Finland with 5.5 million inhabitants can field 600,000 properly trained, properly armed defenders (total number on the books is 900,000). With 23.7 million inhabitants Taiwan should manage two million, i.e., twice the size of the entire People’s Liberation Army ground force and 10 times the size of the largest possible invading force.<br />Military service is very unpopular in Taiwan and it would be in Finland, too, if young Finns were forced to waste their time on parade-ground drills to sustain a conventional structure unlikely to survive one day of missile bombardment. As it is, young Finns look forward to their months of hard but highly purposeful training, rightly confident of defeating badly outnumbered invaders.<br />Edward N. Luttwak<br />Chevy Chase, Md.</td>

Their true roles were uncovered by the British counterintelligence agency, MI5, and they were sent home, according to the report and confirmed by the official. The media organizations aren’t being identified.<br />Wariness in Western countries about Chinese influence is growing beyond economics like trade imbalances and intellectual property protections. Increasingly, Western policy makers, including in the U.S., view China’s links to media, telecommunications and education as threatening to national security.<br />British officials say they have had to adjust in recent years to what they call a severe and growing espionage threat from China, which has long targeted commercial secrets but is increasingly seeking government information. They haven’t depicted the activity as aggressive as Russian espionage, which has been a British focus spanning decades.</td>

When hospitals visibly break down, constraints on political action, much of it ill-advised, will tend to disappear.<br />The second lesson concerns the vaccine. A miscalculation was the idea that, despite the emergency, adherence to existing testing protocols would encourage public confidence. This has now been disproved. Surveys and lengthy news investigations show that tens of millions, including many health-care workers, distrust a product developed at speed behind closed doors in double-blind clinical trials.<br />Early in the pandemic, outside experts urged so-called challenge trials, in which volunteers are deliberately exposed to the virus. An organization, 1 Day Sooner, signed up thousands of would-be participants. Rolling out the candidate vaccines as early as possible to willing volunteers, their fellow citizens and the media could have witnessed the results, which they can’t in double-blind studies where neither the subjects nor the administrator know who got the vaccine.<br />Not only would shots have gotten into millions of arms sooner. The risks of such an approach would have been merely substantial and the potential benefits off-the-charts, measured in trillions of dollars and thousands of lives saved.</td>

      <td>For decades, universities have taken advantage of graduates with humanities Ph.D.s and dim prospects.</td>
      <td>In an email to Artnet News last fall, Yale art professor Carol Armstrongexplained that her department’s “one-year suspension of admissions is directly tied to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis and will have no further ramifications beyond that crisis.” That seems too optimistic. At least 140 graduate programs around the country have halted admissions, likely an acknowledgment of a half-century-old reality: Too many students working on advanced degrees have no hope of landing jobs in their chosen fields. The Covid crisis has merely made a bad situation worse.<br />The given reasons are generally similar. Several University of Chicago departments, including philosophy, music and comparative literature, announced that they won’t accept applications because they are “prioritizing supporting students who have already matriculated in the department.” Brown’s history department decided to focus its “energy and resources on supporting graduate students currently in the program” so “that they can be safe, healthy, and productive.” The University of Pennsylvania suspended all doctoral admissions to its School of Arts and Sciences to ensure current students have the resources to complete their work.<br />This “pause” should have happened decades ago. There are too many graduate programs in fields where there are no jobs. Take philosophy. During the 2018-19 hiring cycle, there were openings for about 180 junior jobs, roughly 70 postdocs, and about 60 spots open to those of any level of the profession, according to calculations by Gonzaga University’s Charles Lassiter. Meanwhile there were about 450 newly minted Ph.D.s in 2014 alone. The situation is similar in history, where the American Historical Association Career Center advertised 538 full-time positions for the 2018-19 school year. But 948 new history doctorates were awarded in 2018.<br />People who earn doctorates in the social sciences and the humanities have few job options outside academia. They can look for work in government, journalism or nonprofits, but they could have done that without spending six or eight years earning an advanced degree. Universities often cover the costs of these programs: They need graduate students to help teach undergraduates so that professors have time to publish studies no one reads. But the students can’t get back the years they lost working on a degree. And then there’s the effect of these degrees on lifetime savings. Someone who starts to invest for retirement at 25 could end up with twice as much as someone who starts at 35.<br />In the 1960s and ’70s, it was common for students to earn doctoral degrees in five years, working in junior academic positions while they finished dissertations. Now the median time to complete a doctorate in the arts and humanities is more than seven years, according to the Survey of Earned Doctorates, while more than half of those who enter doctoral programs never finish. That is a waste of young talent and energy.</td>

      <td>Cuomo blocks funding for a constitutionally required, bipartisan commission to draw fairer lines.</td>
      <td>Ed Koch must be turning in his grave. Less than a decade after the late former New York mayor’s successful crusade to create a fairer redistricting system for congressional and legislative districts, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state Democrats are busy subverting Koch’s work.<br />Business leaders and citizens concerned about New York’s socialist stampede need to pay attention. Robust political competition is good for the state and healthy for democracy. But if Democrats get their way on redistricting, New York will become a permanent one-party state, dooming its economic future.<br />Redistricting is a topic that has never captured the public’s attention, but every 10 years it commands the complete focus of Democratic and Republican politicians. Creating the “right” districts allows lawmakers essentially to select their voters, instead of the voters picking their legislators.<br />In New York, Koch changed all that by leading a coalition of good-government groups and newspaper editorial boards to shame and cajole Gov. Cuomo and lawmakers from both parties into placing a redistricting reform amendment before the voters in 2014. New Yorkers voted 57% to 42% in favor of establishing a bipartisan commission to create new districts, guided by standards limiting politicians’ ability to rig elections by drawing districts that favor those in power. The Legislature ultimately must pass a law enacting the new district lines, with only minor alterations allowed to plans developed by the commission. Courts are required to expedite consideration of any legal challenges to the commission’s work.<br />New constitutional standards require that districts respect existing jurisdictional boundaries and take care to recognize local communities of interest, including those representing racial and ethnic minorities. In a clear break with the past, the Koch reforms also required that minority parties in the state Senate and Assembly have a significant voice in this process.</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—Russia said it would expel diplomats from Sweden, Poland and Germany for taking part in what authorities say were unlawful rallies in support of jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny last month.<br />The ambassador of Sweden, Poland’s chargé d’affaires and a diplomat from the Germany Embassy in Moscow were summoned to Russia’s Foreign Ministry on Friday where they were served with a complaint in connection with “the recorded participation” of diplomatic employees “in illegal actions” on Jan. 23, a ministry statement said.<br />The Foreign Ministry said diplomatic employees from Sweden and Poland in St. Petersburg and of the German Embassy in Moscow violated diplomatic protocol by participating in the protests. “Such actions on their part are unacceptable and don’t correspond to their diplomatic status,” the statement said. The diplomats who took part in the action have been declared “persona non grata” and were ordered to leave Russia in the near future, the statement said.<br />The move raises the stakes for the European Union’s support of Mr. Navalny, who has been increasingly portrayed in state television and by pro-Kremlin authorities as an agent of the West. Mr. Navalny was evacuated to Germany where he spent five months recovering after he was poisoned in the Russian region of Siberia last year.<br />A German military laboratory, as well as labs in France and Sweden said they found Novichok in his system, a military grade nerve agent accessible only to those in Russia’s military and intelligence circles.</td>

      <td>An outsize Moses dominates the scene in Michelangelo’s Tomb of Pope Julius II.</td>
      <td>The bus dumped us in the sweltering Roman piazza before the church of San Pietro in Vincoli. Our destination: the famous statue of Moses. One befuddled visitor asked, “Is this the tomb of Moses?” From inside our earbuds, our unflappable tour guide intoned: “Ecco, the Tomb of Pope Julius II by Michelangelo Buonarroti, painter of the Sistine Ceiling.” Like twittering birds, our flock fluttered around taking pictures, many selfies.<br />Yet what we gazed upon is a far cry from the three-story ziggurat festooned with 40 marble statues that Michelangelo planned to carve himself and imagined as an eighth wonder of the world. The tomb, commissioned by Julius in 1505 for St. Peter’s Basilica and scarcely begun by the time of the pope’s death in 1513, proved to be Michelangelo’s 40-year albatross.<br />It was not completed until 1545, and then only after more than six contracts had been negotiated and innumerable design changes implemented, resulting in a smaller tomb, one set against a wall rather than freestanding. The figure of Moses, now the centerpiece, was originally intended as one of four prophets at the corners of the second story. A dozen years later, Michelangelo’s authorized biographer, Ascanio Condivi, would call the tomb “a tragedy.”<br />Yet the elapsed time also permitted the artist to mature and create a work that stands as a hinge point between the two Michelangelos, the youthful artist who astonished the world creating artistic marvels and the septuagenarian who yearned to be united in Christ.<br />The tomb is a two-story structure raised on a low plinth of undecorated marble, thus elevating and psychologically aggrandizing Moses. The richly decorated lower story with statues of Rachel and Leah acts as frame and foil for the prophet, while offering a dramatic contrast to the unexpectedly tall, and comparatively undecorated, upper story. There, Michelangelo created a bold and innovative architectural language that influenced such later designers as Gian Lorenzo Bernini.</td>

      <td>Election at Alabama warehouse set to be completed by late March</td>
      <td>Federal labor authorities rejected  Amazon.com Inc.’s  request to delay a union election at one of its warehouses in Alabama, clearing the way for thousands of workers to begin casting their votes this month.<br />The National Labor Relations Board denied Amazon’s request Friday, saying the company didn’t raise any substantial issues warranting review of the election. The online shopping giant asked the board in late January to postpone the union vote scheduled to begin Monday at its facility in Bessemer, Ala. Amazon also asked authorities to reconsider allowing mail-in voting due to the pandemic. The workers have until late March to return their ballots in an election that could reshape Amazon’s relationship with its hourly employees.<br />An Amazon spokeswoman said the company was disappointed by the board’s decision. Amazon “proposed a safe on-site election process validated by Covid-19 experts that would have empowered our associates to vote on their way to, during and from their already scheduled shifts,” she said.<br />“It’s long past time that Amazon start respecting its own employees,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, or RWDSU, which would represent the employees if they vote to unionize. Amazon must allow its workers “to cast their votes without intimidation and interference,” he said.<br />The union, which has become a frequent Amazon antagonist in recent years, has sought to garner support by rallying employees through family members and union members who work in other industries. Workers who want to unionize said doing so would let them bargain collectively over safety standards, training, breaks, pay and other workplace matters.</td>

      <td>It took some effort but we found seven dog beds that won’t wreck your carefully planned décor—from beachy baskets to elegant perches based on 19th-century seats</td>
      <td>WHAT IS IT with dog beds? Must they be those slobber-stained blobs that muck up an otherwise thoughtfully decorated interior? Luckily, a few designers, including Ellen Van Dusen, have pondered this as well. “Every bed was a shade of beige, and very utilitarian,” said the textile designer and founder of Brooklyn’s Dusen Dusen Home. “I didn’t get it—if you have all this nice furniture, why would you have this ugly pillow in the middle of the room?” Ms. Van Dusen has gone on to create color-blocked beds in vibrant shades, but pet lovers with more demure taste have stylish options, too—from flaxen chaise longues to rattan baskets that are plushed-out with fluffy cushions.<br />For safety’s sake, Gail Miller Bisher, the Fox Sports analyst for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, offered these tips: Avoid elevated beds for long-backed breeds like corgis or dachshunds, and steer clear of rippable fabrics if you have a teething puppy. Our picks reflect a universal truth: Cute is a mutable concept.<br />This roost brings you one dog bed closer to that dream of a Victorian-style, glass-enclosed room. Sue Jones, creative director of Oka, the brand behind it, underlines its practicality: “It’s hard-wearing and sturdy, and light enough to lift and move around.” In widths from 26 to 42 inches (shown), it can be cozied up with a blanket or cushion.<br />Ideal for: A glossy Irish setter. Rattan Mattaban Pet Bed, from $350, oka.com<br />Like a chic exhaust vent, the MiaCara Covo dog lounge is butch enough for the loft that won’t be softened by dog or design. Though the bed is otherwise unadorned, Düsseldorf interior architect Uta Cossman sneaked a tiny-arch flourish into its bent-plywood base. The 28-inch cushion—in faux fur or a sandy weave—is orthopedic foam.</td>
