      <td>After a monumental trade, a trio grows in the New York City outer borough</td>
      <td>The Brooklyn Nets beat the New York Knicks Wednesday, but that was merely the fine print—the headline happened earlier, in the late afternoon, when word arrived that the Nets acquired the hirsute scoring maestro James Harden from the Houston Rockets in a deal involving four teams, a handful of players, and a flurry of draft picks and “pick swaps” that effectively give Houston the option to pluck Brooklyn’s future for much of the next decade.<br />Basically, as I understand it, if anything new or interesting happens in Brooklyn, on or off the court, for the next bunch of years—in sports, art, music, food, business, politics, real estate—it must now be sent off to Houston, stat.<br />This was apparently the prerequisite to get Harden, and the Nets believe he is worth it, because NBA teams live in the moment, and not in the year 2027. Who knows what 2027 holds, anyway? We could all be living in lunar colonies, or underwater sea caves, annexed to Newfoundland, or Elon Musk.<br />These Nets are especially urgent, because they employ Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, wondrous if fickle polymaths who have shown a willingness to move on if they feel the situation isn’t right. Irving has already stepped away—he’s taking unscheduled time off, popping up on social media videos and a meeting with a Manhattan district attorney candidate, for reasons that have yet to be explained. He isn’t saying why, and neither is the newbie Nets coach, Steve Nash, which makes the whole thing a bit awkward. The hope is Irving will eventually wander in through the out door and return to being one of the most electric point guards to ever do it, which frankly, he is. For now, who knows? C’est la vie avec Kyrie Irving.<br />As for Harden, it’s unclear what version of his talent Brooklyn is welcoming. The version that puttered into the 2020-21 season in Houston seemed disinterested and not exactly in peak fitness. (In fairness, so did I.) Clearly Harden, a virtuoso of angles and shot-making who plays like a combination of George Gervin and Fast Eddie Felson, could pour it in if you made him carry around rocks in a backpack. (He’s at 24.8 points per game this season.) His defense, however, is a mirage, and his commitment in Houston had become so lacking his recently-acquired Rockets teammate, DeMarcus Cousins, blasted him as “disrespectful”—the new guy in town, calling out the franchise star.</td>

      <td>Worker filings for initial jobless claims jumped to nearly one million last week, indicating rising layoffs amid a surge in Covid-19 cases at the start of the year.<br />The number of applications for unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, rose by 181,000 to 965,000 last week, the Labor Department said Thursday. That put initial jobless claims at their highest level since mid-August and well above the roughly 800,000 a week they have averaged in recent months.<br />The increase is another sign that the economic recovery is sputtering, as coronavirus infections hit record levels nationwide.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected the government to report that new unemployment claims, a proxy for layoffs, came in at a seasonally adjusted 800,000 last week.<br />The current level is far less than the peak of nearly seven million jobless claims filed in late March. However, workers are filing nearly four times more applications than they typically did in the first two months of 2020, and still higher than in any other recession on record.</td>

Those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3%.<br />Jobless claims data Thursday showed that 965,000 people applied for unemployment insurance in the week ended Jan. 9, a sizable increase compared with the previous week and higher than economists had expected, as the surge in Covid-19 cases and fresh business restrictions weighed on the labor market.<br />Meantime, all eyes are on a speech expected Thursday from President-elect Joe Biden that is set to detail the scale of his proposed spending package to support households and businesses through the pandemic.<br />Additional stimulus would be favorable for equity markets and reinforce expectations for economic growth, said Luc Filip, head of private banking investments at SYZ Private Banking.</td>

      <td>Semiconductor companies are asking their customers for patience as the industry works through a sharp increase in demand from makers of everything from cars to consumer electronics.<br />The chip shortage has caused prices to rise for certain semiconductors, delays in filling orders and auto makers to idle factories. If the problems persist, consumers may see delays in getting new cars and some electronic devices, and possibly higher prices.<br />There is no quick fix to the situation, either. Adding new chip-making machinery can be expensive and slow, and some of the deepest supply problems are taking place with older production lines that are less lucrative for manufacturers.<br />“In the whole semiconductor industry there is very little [spare] capacity right now—everything is doing well,” said Risto Puhakka, president of VLSIresearch, an industry-analysis firm. “We’re coming off a record investment year, and the demand continues to grow.”<br />The shortages add to the upheaval currently affecting the semiconductor industry. Intel Corp. this week ousted its chief executive, Bob Swan, after product delays, and mobile-phone chip giant Qualcomm Inc. added to a deal-making frenzy.</td>

Some Republicans who opposed impeachment have publicly criticized the president, with a handful suggesting the party must break free of his influence to regain power in Washington. Many in the party are smarting over losing control of both the White House and Senate in the last election.<br />Many others in the GOP are sticking by him, to varying degrees. More than 140 House Republicans objected to certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s election win after the riot.<br />In this GOP-leaning suburb of Charleston, represented by freshman Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, some of the party’s voters said they still back Mr. Trump. They condemned the mob in Washington last week but—unlike Ms. Mace—said the president wasn’t responsible for the actions of those supporters.<br />“Right now, Republicans across the board are weak,” said Gary Simons, a Republican.  He said he opposed the violence on Jan. 6, but he thought Mr. Trump was right to challenge the November election results, saying it was “what the people needed him to do.” He said he had expected more Republicans would object to certifying Mr. Biden’s win.</td>

      <td>At this year’s virtual tech extravaganza, a new wave of home tech aims to blend in, not stand out</td>
      <td>CES is an all-virtual, pared-down affair this year, featuring new versions of many usual suspects. So far, we’ve seen filmmaking drones, dishwashing robots, rollable phones and other kinds of gadgetry ranging from clever to crazy. The annual conference’s main value proposition is that it offers a little glimpse into the future—yet the most compelling new smart-home gadgets don’t look futuristic at all.<br />That’s precisely what I’m excited about: tech that is at its best when it just blends into the woodwork, sometimes literally.<br />There’s a device to make any coffee table a wireless charging station, a standard-looking deadbolt lock that unlocks with a touch, a bed with a disappearing, transparent TV, and a faucet that can dispense exactly two tablespoons of water on command. My personal favorite—a toilet with a lid that automatically opens as you approach and closes when you walk away—solves one of the longest, ongoing quarrels in my home.<br />Living with technology can often mean a mess of different cables, apps, adapters, remotes and confusing interfaces. Gadgets that can tuck themselves away or have hidden smarts, unlocked with a word or a hand wave, are an especially nice idea, especially now that we’ve been spending more time at home.<br />A hidden wireless Qi charger, called UTS-1, can be mounted to the underside of a nonmetallic surface using the included tape. Plug it into the wall, and you’ve just added wireless charging to your furniture. It keeps your desk tidy and prevents your housemates from stealing your charger.</td>

That brought the airline’s 2020 losses to nearly $12.4 billion, making it the company’s worst year ever and marking its first annual loss since 2009.<br />The industry remains in dire straits. The months after the December holidays are typically the weakest for airlines, which have already been battered by 10 months of a pandemic that nearly obliterated appetite for travel.<br />Now Covid-19 cases are surging, with daily fatalities in the U.S. hitting new records. The early stages of vaccine distribution, meanwhile, have been slower than expected and officials have implemented renewed travel restrictions in many parts of the world in response to new coronavirus strains that are potentially more contagious.<br />U.S. air-passenger volumes briefly swelled during Christmas and New Year’s, hitting a pandemic high of more than 1.3 million people streaming through airport security screening checkpoints on Jan. 3. But the numbers have quickly dropped off and are down about 60% from a year ago.</td>

He added that the intrusion was isolated and that the hack didn’t affect the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, nor did it spread to other agencies within the department.<br />“The public can have total confidence in the data that BLS has,” he said. He added that the department determined that none of the bureau’s data was “exfiltrated,” or transferred from the bureau’s systems. “No data was lost or corrupted,” Mr. Scalia said.<br />U.S. officials and cybersecurity experts have characterized the attack as a cyber-espionage campaign, not one intended to damage computer systems.<br />Mr. Scalia became labor secretary in September 2019. He previously worked as a corporate-regulation and labor-law attorney. In the interview he discussed his concerns with the unemployment-insurance system, the transition to the Biden administration and the need to protect democracy in the wake of the Capitol riot. He declined to comment on impeachment proceedings or calls to remove President Trump from office. He is expected to step down as labor secretary when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated Jan. 20.</td>

      <td>Global appetite for oil will remain subdued in the first quarter of 2021 due to coronavirus lockdown measures and rising infection rates, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said Thursday.<br />In its monthly report, OPEC maintained its forecast that world oil demand in 2021 won’t recover to the levels seen before the pandemic. Global demand took a 10% hit last year and the cartel expects it to rebound to 95.9 million barrels a day this year, but remain 4% below 2019 levels.<br />Despite the beginning of vaccination programs in recent weeks, rising infection rates in wealthy Western nations are continuing to stymie an economic recovery, OPEC said. In Europe, government restrictions are forecast to significantly hurt growth again in the first quarter of 2021, it added.<br />While the economic impact of the virus is continuing in richer Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, demand in large non-OECD nations such as China and India has recovered strongly. OPEC expects demand in non-OECD countries to increase by 3.3 million barrels a day in 2021.<br />Oil prices and equities have risen sharply in recent weeks, buoyed by vaccinations and Saudi Arabia’s announcement last week that it would unilaterally cut an additional one million barrels of daily oil production next month on top of the reductions already agreed on between OPEC and its allies.</td>

      <td>The world’s largest contract chip maker is benefiting from surging demand, struggling competitors and top-notch technology</td>
      <td>It’s good to be king, particularly when other kingdoms are struggling.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , the world’s largest contract chip maker, is benefiting from a combination of surging demand, struggling competitors and top-notch technology. And it’s betting big on the future to keep that edge.<br />TSMC just logged another bumper quarter: Net profit for the three months ending in December rose 23% from a year earlier. That brought full-year profit to a record $17.6 billion, a 50% increase from 2019.<br />Strong demand has helped TSMC, which makes chips for companies like Apple and Nvidia. Stay-at-home demand has led to a boom in personal computers and servers used in data centers. Also, 5G smartphones and base stations added to chip demand.<br />TSMC has also sailed smoothly through the Trump administration’s ban on Huawei, previously an important customer. China only accounted for 6% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, compared with 22% a year earlier. Orders from Apple and Taiwanese chip company  MediaTek ,  which supplies many Chinese smartphone makers, probably helped to offset the blow.<br />The sudden jump in demand led to tight supply for chips throughout the year. Shortages have forced some car makers to delay production. TSMC’s revenue from the automotive sector grew 27% last quarter, though the segment only accounted for 3% of its revenue. The supply constraints have helped TSMC: The company managed to expand its net profit margin last quarter by 2.9 percentage points compared with a year earlier.</td>

      <td>New York City apartment tenants are more than $1 billion in debt from missed rent payments during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey measuring the depth of the rent crisis brought on by Covid-19.<br />The debt figure is the most recent indicator that unemployment benefits and federal stimulus packages have so far been inadequate to alleviate the growing financial burden of missed rent payments across thousands of city households. Both landlord and tenant advocacy groups have lobbied heavily for more government rental assistance during the pandemic.<br />The survey, conducted by the Community Housing Improvement Program, a landlord trade group, focused on New York buildings subject to the city’s rent-regulation laws. These apartments account for about half of the city’s total rental apartments. Tallying responses from landlords, the group estimated that as many as 185,000 households living in these apartments are more than two months behind on rent, with an average debt of more than $6,000.<br />Jay Martin, executive director of CHIP, said rent debt from the rest of New York’s apartment inventory is probably the same or greater, meaning the total debt New York City renters are carrying is likely more than $2 billion.<br />“It’s not an insurmountable amount,” Mr. Martin said. “The numbers tell us that, probably, if we could get an additional billion or two dollars in the city, we could probably pay off every single renter’s arrears in the entire city of New York over the last year of the crisis.”</td>

If the trend continues throughout January it would mark the first month of net inflows since September 2018.<br />The $1.2 trillion market for loans with below-investment grade credit ratings has been out of favor with individual investors for years and lagged behind the “everything rally” that lifted most markets to records in 2020. That gives the loans more potential upside than most Wall Street offerings in the year to come, fund managers said.<br />“I think we’re about to see a lot of demand for loans,” said Gershon Distenfeld, co-head of fixed income at  AllianceBernstein Holding  LP. The firm’s funds that specialize in high-yield bonds increased holdings of the so-called leveraged loans to about 10% in recent months from a historical average of around 4%.</td>

The allegations prompted monthslong protests in which millions of South Koreans took to the streets demanding Ms. Park’s resignation. Ms. Park was impeached in late 2016 and removed from office the following year.<br />The corruption scandal involving Ms. Park put a spotlight on the traditionally close ties between the government and family-run corporations, known as chaebols, that dominate the economy. The investigation shook the country’s political and business establishments, leading to public hearings and the jailing of prominent figures like Samsung’s de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong.<br />Mr. Lee, the grandson of Samsung’s founder, was convicted on charges including bribery and embezzlement in 2017.

The rest of the 15-member delegation arrived on Thursday as planned in Wuhan, the original center of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The early snag adds a further complication to a mission already fraught with political sensitivities, as Beijing has waged a broad campaign to cast doubt on the origins of a pathogen that was first discovered in central China. The WHO and Beijing have spent months negotiating the terms of the mission, which has been delayed several times, and the United Nations agency’s researchers say they don’t have a clear understanding of the progress that Chinese scientists have made in what is meant to be a collaborative effort.<br />Chinese state media reported on the WHO delegation’s Thursday arrival in Wuhan, without giving details about its composition.<br />The two WHO delegation members held up in Singapore tested negative for Covid-19 in swab tests, the people briefed on the matter said.</td>

Instead of flying northeast as expected, the plane veered northwest and at one point, a controller instructed the pilots to execute a turn to get back on track, one of these people said.<br />It is too early to draw definitive conclusions about the sequence of events before the crash that killed all 62 people on board, according to these people and safety experts not connected with the investigation. Indonesian authorities said the aircraft’s flight-data recorder, one of its so-called black boxes, was recovered by divers Tuesday and taken to a laboratory so its contents can be downloaded.<br />Authorities said they believe the location of the cockpit-voice recorder—which is the other black box—also has been identified, but rough seas prevented retrieval Wednesday.<br />For now, according to the safety experts, the crew’s lack of response on the radio could indicate pilot confusion or distraction. One possibility is that a problem with some mechanical or flight-control system could have consumed the pilots’ attention, they said.</td>

But by April, China’s factories were coming back online and retooling themselves to churn out medical and work-from-home computer equipment that filled shipping containers headed to Western countries then reeling from the pandemic.<br />Next, when Western countries began opening up their economies in the second half of the year, Chinese factories continued producing and shipping other goods abroad as demand for medical and computer equipment eased, defying months of market expectations that the exports boom would fade.</td>

While the actions might be justified in the current moment, he added, “over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet.”<br />Tech companies continue to roll out limits on Mr. Trump’s online options. Snapchat parent Snap Inc., which locked his account indefinitely last week, said Wednesday it would ban him permanently as of Jan. 20 in the interest of public safety and based on his attempts to spread misinformation and hate speech and to incite violence.<br />On Tuesday, YouTube suspended Mr. Trump’s channel. The video-sharing unit of  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google said it was locking the channel for at least seven days after the company removed videos it said violated its policies against content it believes could incite violence.<br />Facebook Inc.  last week suspended Mr. Trump indefinitely—at least through the rest of his term—and Twitter banned him permanently, after pro-Trump rioters invaded the U.S. Capitol and threatened lawmakers. Several other prominent technology companies have also taken steps to limit posts by Mr. Trump and others they feel may be inciting more violence.</td>

But unlike some smaller peers, Chesapeake came into bankruptcy with an exit proposal, supported by top lenders, already in place.<br />After approving the company’s plan during a virtual court hearing, Judge Jones addressed Chesapeake Chief Executive Robert Lawler directly, telling him “to remember that a lot of people have suffered a lot of pain for Chesapeake to have a second chance and I ask that you not forget that going forward.<br />“Chesapeake is a really big and important company. It’s an important company to our country’s infrastructure, it helps make everything work,” Judge Jones said. “But we live right now in a very, very difficult time and you have the ability to be a leader and to make a difference.”</td>

SlideBelts returned the $350,000 loan proceeds in July after multiple requests by the Small Business Administration, which administers the PPP.<br />Under SBA rules, companies under bankruptcy protection aren’t eligible to access the PPP, an enormously popular program of forgivable, government-guaranteed loans designed to keep checks flowing to Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />“The defendants made false statements to multiple banks in order to obtain a [PPP] loan that should have been disbursed to an honest small business suffering financially from the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic,” U.S. attorney McGregor W.

The Justice Department and the SBA will “aggressively pursue those who exploit federal programs intended to help those in need during this national emergency,” he said.<br />As part of the settlement, SlideBelts and Mr. Taylor, who is also the company’s chief financial officer, admitted to making false statements to the three different banks where they submitted PPP applications, prosecutors said.</td>

      <td>For months, President Trump and his allies made numerous claims about election fraud in various competitive states. The drumbeat of unsubstantiated allegations has left some Americans with the false impression that the presidential election saw widespread wrongdoing—and others confused about what actually happened.<br />Mr. Trump repeated some of those claims in his speech at a Jan. 6 rally before a mob stormed the Capitol. His alleged encouragement led to his impeachment Wednesday by the House.<br />Journal reporters have received many questions from readers about these claims, looking for answers beyond the findings in court rulings and by then-Attorney General William Barr that there was no evidence of widespread fraud that could overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory.<br />Here, we tackle some of the claims, including some repeated by Mr. Trump.<br />Claim: Pennsylvania reported more votes than voters who cast ballots.</td>

      <td>NHTSA actions would affects Model S and Model X vehicles; agency has concerns about touchscreen</td>
      <td>Federal regulators are asking  Tesla Inc.  to recall about 158,000 vehicles over safety concerns in what would amount to one of the biggest safety actions by the electric-vehicle maker.<br />The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked Tesla in a Jan. 13 letter to recall some Model S luxury sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles. NHTSA asked for the recall because the cars’ touch screens can fail after a few years of use, affecting safety functions on the vehicles like defogging and back-up cameras.<br />Some car recalls run into millions of vehicles. Though modest by historic numbers, the action would represent a relatively large recall for Tesla, which has far fewer cars on the road than some rivals. The Silicon Valley car maker delivered nearly 500,000 vehicles globally last year.<br />Tesla doesn’t have to recall the vehicles, though NHTSA said in the letter that if the car maker doesn’t take the action it has to provide an explanation for its decision. The agency can then escalate the matter to a public hearing and eventually seek to force a recall through the courts.<br />Tesla in 2018 recalled 123,000 Model S cars over a finding that cold weather could corrode some bolts, potentially leading to power-steering failures.</td>

      <td>The best outcome now is to make the House vote the end with no Senate trial.</td>
      <td>Democrats rushed through their second impeachment of President Trump on Wednesday, with less than a week left before he exits the Oval Office. The exercise is mostly about making a political statement since it will have no other practical effect, though it might stir up more public anger and discord.<br />We’re on record as saying Mr. Trump committed an impeachable offense in inciting supporters to march on Congress with a goal of overturning the election as the electoral votes were counted. He may not have directly incited violence, but he still promoted an assault on the democratic transfer of power.<br />Mr. Trump was so self-deluded that he seems to believe this was possible, and he encouraged his supporters to believe it too. Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell resisted at a crucial moment and saved the day.<br />Mr. Trump will soon be gone, Joe Biden will take power, yet Democrats are still preoccupied with Donald Trump. On Tuesday they issued an ultimatum to Mr. Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and depose Mr. Trump or they’d impeach. Mr. Pence rightly refused and on proper grounds: the 25th Amendment was meant for a President who is incapacitated. Only a single Republican voted for the gambit.<br />Then Wednesday Democrats sprinted to the floor to impeach: No hearings, no fact-finding, no chance for defense. To what end? One goal seems to be simply to tag him as the only President impeached twice and to declare that Mr. Trump’s actions are unacceptable. In that case the House vote should be enough. Everyone voted his conscience, and that should be the end of it.</td>

      <td>With Donald Trump in his final presidential days, the hardest job in the world may be White House counsel. So here’s a note of thanks for Pat Cipollone, who is staying on the job when the easier route would be to resign to outside applause.<br />No one can predict what Mr. Trump will do in the next week, and he often ignores the advice of his lawyers while heeding the horrendous counsel of opportunists like Rudy Giuliani. Case in point: Mr. Trump’s apparent belief that Vice President Mike Pence could overturn the state Electoral College votes on Jan. 6.<br />Mr. Trump could continue to make bad decisions, such as pardoning himself as he leaves office. That would increase the odds that the Biden Justice Department would look for some charge to make against Mr. Trump to challenge the pardon in court. The case might travel up to the Supreme Court, which could put new limits on the capacious language of the Pardon Clause in the Constitution.<br />Mr. Trump did one good deed Wednesday in finally issuing a clear statement calling for no violent protests: “In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind. That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers.” Mr. Trump should say this again from the Oval Office, but whoever encouraged that statement did a public service.<br />Every official has to search his conscience amid Mr. Trump’s actions, and outside moral judgment is easy and often wrong. Many good people are trying to prevent more bad decisions.</td>

      <td>How trust busters botched the Staples-Office Depot merger.</td>
      <td>Five years ago the Federal Trade Commission broke up the Staples- Office Depot  merger attempt. Its dubious complaint is worth revisiting now as Staples tries again to get hitched to Office Depot to compete with  Amazon .<br />Staples’s private-equity owner Sycamore Partners this week proposed to buy Office Depot for $2.1 billion—a song compared to the $6.3 billion deal the FTC killed. The FTC had complained the merger would effectively create an office-supply monopoly, narrowly defining the competitive market as large corporate contracts.<br />Amazon, the government argued, was merely a bit supplier to big businesses and its higher costs couldn’t possibly allow it to compete. Lol. As we argued at the time (“Protecting Big Business”), the FTC’s job is to protect consumers, not corporations. In any case Office Depot and Staples still faced plenty of competition from  Costco ,  Amazon and  Walmart .<br />Federal judge Emmet Sullivan agreed with the FTC and enjoined the merger. Sycamore then took Staples private. Both office-supply retailers have since closed hundreds of stores as more businesses and consumers have bought office supplies online. As more documents go digital, people need less ink, file folders, Post-it Notes, etc.<br />Their corporate business has also been gobbled by Amazon, which advertises that it serves 55 of the top Fortune 100 companies. Because of its scale, Amazon can charge lower prices. Hence Sycamore is now trying to rekindle the merger.</td>

We’ve seen a copy of the 12-page document, and it reads like a hostage plea.<br />“To help establish a shared vision on U.S. climate policy, the financial services industry seeks to engage with incoming administration leaders and members of Congress on a bipartisan basis,” IIF says. “By so doing, we hope to inform the policymaking process and demonstrate our willingness and capacity to support a common-sense transition to a more sustainable, and inclusive, low-carbon economy.” At your climate service, sirs.<br />IIF notes that “the financial services industry has been active on climate priorities for decades, helping to build an analytical, market-based foundation for quantifying, reporting and managing climate risks, and supporting new opportunities.”<br />IIF calls for a “common approach” to corporate sustainability disclosures that have been developed by outfits such as the Global Reporting Initiative, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (Sasb).

Houston is also getting Victor Oladipo from the Indiana Pacers and another first-round pick in 2022 after expanding the deal to send Caris LeVert from the Nets to the Indiana Pacers and Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince to the Cleveland Cavaliers.<br />The dizzying trade during an especially chaotic week in the NBA involves four teams, four draft picks, four pick swaps and at least four intriguing players—and one huge bet from the Nets.</td>

      <td>He’s wrong to skip the inauguration, but he can still discourage any further violence.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump won’t be the first president to skip his successor’s inauguration.<br />The original boycotter was John Adams. After a vicious campaign, Adams left Washington at 4 a.m. on Inauguration Day, March 4, 1801, on the first stagecoach home to Massachusetts. Eight hours later, blue-coated militiamen snapped to attention and an artillery company fired a round as Thomas Jefferson emerged from his boarding house at New Jersey Avenue and C Street. The U.S. marshal for Maryland then walked Jefferson, members of Congress, foreign diplomats and local residents several hundred yards north to the Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony.<br />John Quincy Adams made inaugural absences a family tradition. In March 1829, he departed the White House the day before Andrew Jackson’s swearing-in. Like the 1800 election, the 1828 campaign was particularly nasty.<br />There are similarities between Mr. Trump and Andrew Johnson, the last president who refused to participate in marking the peaceful transfer of power. Though both were elected as Republicans, neither Mr. Trump nor Johnson, Abraham Lincoln’s running mate in 1864, was a longtime party member. Johnson was a Southern Democrat who opposed secession. Mr. Trump was a celebrity real-estate tycoon who had supported Republicans and Democrats.<br />Both Mr. Trump and Johnson had been impeached and acquitted. Mr. Trump faced charges of Russian collusion while Johnson was accused of violating the Tenure of Office Act, which required congressional approval to remove a cabinet member. Both impeachments were motivated largely by other factors: Democratic anger that Mr. Trump was elected, and Mr. Johnson’s opposition to congressional Republicans’ move to impose on the defeated South state governments dominated by men loyal to the union and black suffrage.</td>

      <td>Federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies are using facial-recognition technology to identify the members of the mob that assaulted the U.S. Capitol last week.<br />Elsewhere, facial recognition and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used for nefarious purposes—including by China to persecute minorities and to identify Hong Kong dissidents.<br />We represent Clearview AI, the U.S. facial-recognition startup that became controversial a year ago when its existence came to light in the media. Clearview AI maintains a database of billions of publicly posted photographs that have been lawfully downloaded from the Internet, where users posted them on public websites, including social media. Clearview AI downloads photographs from the public internet that are available to any user from any computer around the world without the consent of the person photographed.<br />Licensed clients of Clearview AI—which are limited to law-enforcement agencies—can run a photo of an unidentified person through Clearview AI’s database for after-the-crime investigations. Clearview AI uses algorithms to create facial vectors, or “faceprints,” of the photo’s subject.<br />The question for policy makers is how to regulate this technology to allow its legitimate use and prevent abuse. A patchwork of state and local laws seek to restrict or even prohibit the use of biometrics, including faceprints. These are of dubious constitutionality, since the Supreme Court has made plain that “the creation and dissemination of information are speech within the meaning of the First Amendment.”</td>

      <td>For people who can control their impulses and regulate their emotions—so it is argued—the use of drugs, including heroin, can have good effects.</td>
      <td>In a referendum in November, Oregon became the first state to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and LSD. The move was inspired by a 2001 law in Portugal that removed incarceration as a penalty for drug possession. To judge by “Drug Use for Grown-Ups,” Carl Hart welcomed this news, which came too late for him to mention in his provocative and enlightening book. He opens with the announcement: “I am an unapologetic drug user.”<br />Mr. Hart, a professor of psychology and a neuroscientist at Columbia University, asserts that “recreational drugs can be used safely to enhance many vital human activities.” He bases his claim on decades of research on the behavioral and physiological effects of drugs in humans, coupled with his personal use. Thanks to drugs, he says, “I am a happier and better person.” He asks that we think about drugs in a more nuanced way, even at a time when opioid abuse is still headline news. Thus his book represents a calculated risk—namely, that by portraying drug use as so potentially rewarding for responsible users, it may inadvertently seduce non-grown-ups into hazardous use.<br />Mr. Hart reports that his views about drugs have evolved over the years. Growing up near Miami as a teen in the early 1980s, a city then overrun with crack cocaine, he saw drugs as a raging menace. In graduate school he began studying neuroscience. “If I could stop people from taking drugs, especially by fixing their broken brains,” he told himself, “I could fix the poverty and crime in my community.” In pursuit of this mission, he tried to prove the dangers of drug use. But over time he concluded that the marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine that he gave (with the approval of various ethics committees) to his subjects, themselves experienced drug users, was not as harmful as he had expected. No matter the drug, his subjects overwhelmingly said that they felt “more altruistic, empathetic, euphoric, focused, grateful, and tranquil.”<br />“Drug Use for Grown-Ups” has the soul of a manifesto. Mr. Hart wants to show us that “government bans on recreational drugs violate the spirit and promise of the nation’s founding document.” Putting it more personally, he writes: “It is my birthright to use substances in my pursuit of happiness.” Though a regular user of heroin, Mr. Hart says that he is “not an addict,” adding: “I have never failed to meet my obligations as a result of the drug or its effects.” The same is true for most other heroin users, he says, citing data showing that addiction affects only 10% to 30% of those who regularly use heroin and methamphetamine, among other drugs.<br />The alleged enslaving nature of drugs—you use it and you’re hooked—is one of many misperceptions that Mr. Hart tries to dispel. Each of his chapters presents a tutorial on the pharmacology and physiological effects of a particular class of drug, including opioids, amphetamines, psychedelics, cocaine and cannabis.</td>

      <td>Alphabet has no legal obligation to recognize or negotiate with the well-funded pressure group.</td>
      <td>The “union” formed by workers last week at Google parent company Alphabet isn’t really a labor union in the traditional sense. Rather it’s a pressure group funded by the Communications Workers of America, which will provide staff and support to generate negative publicity about management at the Mountain View, Calif., company. The so-called Alphabet Workers Union is composed of fewer than 800 workers among Alphabet’s roughly 250,000 employees and contractors, some of whom are technically employed by completely separate entities, some of which are already unionized.<br />The AWU describes itself as a “minority” or “members only” union, but such things are unlawful under federal labor law. Alphabet has no obligation to meet with, recognize or afford the AWU—or the CWA—any special rights. The group has no legal authority to bargain with Alphabet, and there is no reason the company should do so.<br />A real union has a democratic mandate, with a majority of employees voting to designate it their exclusive representative to bargain with their employer. Real unions represent a group of employees, with a true community of interest, bound by job location and classification and with legal standing to negotiate for better wages and working conditions.<br />The union movement in the U.S. arose to address workplace concerns far more pressing than the ones faced by Alphabet employees. For highly paid white-collar tech employees to co-opt the union label—while other workers still fight for safe workplaces, livable wages and essential benefits—is an insult to the American labor movement.<br />It is hardly surprising that the tech industry has shown little interest in a unionized workforce. Most tech workers are highly skilled and enjoy generous pay and benefits. The dangerous conditions and unfair work practices that unions were created to combat simply don’t exist in an environment where the average employee makes more than $250,000 and receives Cadillac health-care, tuition reimbursement and other benefits—including free food.</td>

      <td>Some rioters’ lawyers approach prosecutors in bid to avoid charges as FBI warns other agencies that partisan grievances are expected to fuel further violence</td>
      <td>Several members of the pro-Trump mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol last week have reported their own involvement to law enforcement this week, officials said Wednesday, as prosecutors race to charge dozens of the most visible participants in the attack and continue to dig into what kind of planning went into it.<br />Lawyers for several of the rioters have called law enforcement to disclose information about their clients’ participation in the breach in an effort to avoid more serious criminal charges and potentially negotiate plea deals, law-enforcement officials said.<br />In dozens of cases filed since the deadly riot, prosecutors have targeted some of the most visible participants whose efforts were broadcast widely on social media. They announced the arrest Wednesday of a Virginia man who was photographed on the scene wearing a sweatshirt bearing the words Camp Auschwitz. Among others arrested was a man from Idaho who was identified from photos showing him hanging by one hand from the Senate balcony.<br />The two men are charged with violent entry or disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, among other counts. The affidavit filed in support of the arrest of 56-year-old Robert Packer cites media reports that identified him as the man photographed in the sweatshirt referring to the Nazi concentration camp, and says an informant contacted law enforcement after recognizing him as a routine customer at a store in Newport News, Va. An attorney for Mr. Packer couldn’t be identified for comment.<br />The new cases come as Washington and cities across the country brace for the possibility of more armed protests and violence in the days before Joe Biden’s inauguration. Biden officials said Wednesday that the president-elect received a briefing from Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Secret Service officials to learn more about the threat picture and what plans are being assembled to thwart potential attacks.</td>

      <td>As footage of a pro-Trump mob ransacking the U.S. Capitol streamed from Washington, D.C., last Wednesday,  Facebook Inc.’s  data scientists and executives saw warning signs of further trouble.<br />User reports of violent content jumped more than 10-fold from the morning, according to documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. A tracker for user reports of false news surged to nearly 40,000 reports an hour, about four times recent daily peaks. On Instagram, the company’s popular photo-sharing platform, views skyrocketed for content from authors in “zero trust” countries, reflecting potential efforts at platform manipulation by entities overseas.<br />Facebook’s platforms were aflame, the documents show. One Instagram presentation, circulated internally and seen by the Journal, was subtitled “Why business as usual isn’t working.”<br />Company leaders feared a feedback loop, according to people familiar with the matter, in which the incendiary events in Washington riled up already on-edge social-media users—potentially leading to more strife in real life.<br />Facebook ultimately decided on a series of actions over the past week that, taken together, amount to its most aggressive interventions against President Trump and his supporters. And they show the company continuing to grapple with how best to police its platforms while still allowing for political discussion.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—As the House weighed removing President Trump from office for last week’s violent riot, a small army was on hand to make sure another attack didn’t happen.<br />Hundreds of National Guard troops and police officers were stationed throughout Capitol Hill Wednesday, a week after a mob of the president’s supporters overwhelmed police, ransacked the building and left five dead. Some troops rested by statues of American icons inside the Capitol, laying their assault-style weapons beside them on the marble floors. Others stockpiled riot shields and gas masks. Five-ton armored trucks cut off traffic in the surrounding neighborhood.<br />Already largely void of visitors and staff because of the coronavirus pandemic, the halls of American democracy were transformed into a military zone, with many lawmakers and staff on Capitol Hill still reeling from last week’s violence.<br />Much of the physical damage from the attack, when rioters forced lawmakers to delay the ratification of Joe Biden’s election victory, had been repaired by Wednesday. Glass was replaced on the door near the House chamber where a Capitol Police officer shot one of the rioters, who later died, and broken furniture and debris were swept away.<br />But for lawmakers, many of whom police rushed to secure locations during the attack, the events of last week were still raw. Democrats moved rapidly to bring the article of impeachment to the floor, winning the support of 10 House Republicans, and law-enforcement officials are bracing for more potential violence in Washington and in state capitals.</td>

      <td>Moynihan Train Hall, the expansion of Penn Station to the Beaux-Arts James A. Farley building, imbues boarding Amtrak and commuter lines with some grandeur.</td>
      <td>New York<br />There is a certain class of buildings that only the public should judge. When it comes to a great urban train station, for instance, the opinion of the critic scarcely matters. Is it spacious and bright enough? Do its paths of movement make sense, are they instantly legible? Does it treat its passengers with basic human courtesy, or as livestock to be driven along into their pens? The passenger alone can tell. And so to assess New York’s Moynihan Train Hall, which opened on New Year’s Day, I traveled there as an Amtrak passenger, having deliberately read nothing about it in advance. I wanted to be surprised.<br />The new $1.6 billion train hall is housed in the former main post office, on Eighth Avenue, just to the west of Penn Station. It is a fluke that a building was there to absorb the station’s excess capacity; buildings, unlike opera singers, do not usually have stand-ins waiting in the wings. But it was once the practice to build major train stations and post offices in tandem, the same tracks carrying both passengers and mail. New York paired Penn Station (1910) with the James A. Farley Post Office (1913/1934), both by McKim, Mead & White, America’s most gifted classical architects. The buildings were elevated directly above the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad, whose tunnel under the Hudson River made the complex possible.<br />The original Penn Station was demolished in 1964, right down to its train platforms, and in its place was built Madison Square Garden. The decapitated station below delivered a thoroughly nasty travel experience, not only for passengers on Amtrak (which replaced the bankrupt Penn Central) but also for those on the Long Island Rail Road and NJ Transit. Departing passengers stood shoulder to shoulder in their shapeless corral, watching the big timetable perform its coy fan dance of delay upon delay, until the announcement of the track launched the frenzied crush toward an escalator wide enough for one. Having experienced it once, you never forgot it—like the running of the bulls in Pamplona, but in a cellar and with less dignity.<br />Depending where you exit your train, you can still emerge inside Penn Station, which will continue to remain in operation. There I found myself last week and began searching for the passage to the Moynihan Train Hall. As it happens, there is none; trains can move in a straight line between the two buildings but you cannot. It takes some time to find the meek arrow that sends you outside, where you must make your way across Eighth Avenue. In fact, one can get there without going outside, by negotiating the concourse of the Long Island Rail Road, although the path is so labyrinthine that you are as likely to find the Minotaur as Moynihan Hall.</td>

      <td><br /><br />The annualPrototype Festival (through Jan. 16), produced by Beth Morrison Projects and HERE, always explores new territory in chamber opera theater. This year’s iteration, restricted to digital content due to the Covid-19 pandemic, has, paradoxically, gone even further than usual. The festival’s six presentations headily push boundaries in media, composition, content and geography. They are also available to a much wider public than Prototype’s small theaters can normally hold, and all but one (“Modulation,” which costs $25) are free of charge.<br />For “Modulation,” the 2021 festival’s world-premiere commission, 13 composers—seven of them women, almost all of them people of color—created a series of short films, accessed through an interactive website. On the home page, vocalist Carmina Escobar’s breath-centered music invites the user to select among three lighted doors; these lead to new pages, each a collection of films about “Identity,” “Fear” or “Isolation,” all themes germane to the current moment.<br />The pieces are as diverse as their creators, and they communicate their personal and political messages with clarity and verve. In “Identity,” Juhi Bansal’s “Waves of Change” juxtaposes melismatic singing in Bengali, a cello solo, and footage of a woman on a surfboard to evoke a sense of boundless freedom. Another “Identity” piece, Paul Pinto’s “Whiteness: Blanc,” uses snappy spoken text and the exponentially multiplied image of the artist’s brown face for a seriocomic exploration of the answer to the question “Where are you from?” “Fear” includes Yvette Janine Jackson’s “Fear Is Their Alibi,” in which a soprano sings a slow blues to an ominous bassoon accompaniment as an animated black line becomes a house, a hand, and a boot that viciously crushes the rest of the line into a helpless black puddle.</td>

      <td>Investors who bet that shares of  GameStop Corp.  would fall shifted positions Wednesday, sending the struggling videogame retailer’s stock soaring to its highest levels in years.<br />GameStop shares were up more than 57% to $31.40 on Wednesday, marking a steep climb from a year earlier, when the stock was valued at just $4.61 a share.<br />That recovery—fueled in part by the company’s announcement two days ago that it would add Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen and two of his former colleagues to its board—created a so-called short squeeze that drove share prices sharply higher, according to some analysts. A short squeeze occurs when traders respond to an increase in price for a stock they bet would drop by purchasing shares in order to avoid losses.<br />Many traders believed GameStop’s shares were set to decline. As of the end of last year, short interest in the stock—expressed as a percentage of GameStop shares available for trading—exceeded 138%, making it the second-most shorted company by that metric with a market value of at least $1 billion, according to data from FactSet.<br />It is fairly rare that short interest would exceed shares available to trade on the public markets, said James Angel, a Georgetown University professor who studies financial markets. Such positions can build up because traders are able to borrow shares from other investors, and those shares can be loaned more than once, according to Dr. Angel.</td>

      <td>The Latin name for a marauding ancient Germanic tribe made its way into the new article of impeachment against Donald Trump</td>
      <td>The article of impeachment introduced against President Trump accuses him of inciting a crowd that “unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol,” among other “violent, deadly, destructive and seditious acts.” As the Journal has reported, the pro-Trump rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 vandalized statues and other historic artwork housed there.<br />Even before last week’s riot, politically motivated vandalism was in the news. When Congress adjourned its 2020 session without passing a bill approving $2,000 stimulus checks, the homes of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were both vandalized with spray paint.<br />“Vandalize” and “vandalism” are formed from “vandal,” for someone who willfully or maliciously damages property. The words memorialize historic acts of destruction from a millennium and a half ago that went far beyond defacing statues or spray-painting graffiti.<br />The original vandals were a Germanic people who sacked Rome in 455 AD, after overrunning Gaul, Spain and northern Africa. The Latin name for the tribe was the “Vandali,” plural of “Vandalus.” That was simply the Roman version of the name used by tribal members themselves in an early Germanic language. Etymologists think the name may go back to a Proto-Germanic root, “wandljaz,” meaning “wanderer.”<br />Because the Vandals were associated with plundering Roman civilization, the word was transferred to someone who disregards or damages items of historical or cultural significance, or someone who acts in a barbaric fashion.</td>

The shares closed at $97.24.<br />The enthusiastic reception for Affirm shares could indicate that 2021 will be similar to 2020. That was the most lucrative year on record for public offerings in terms of money raised, driven in part by the success of companies like  DoorDash Inc.  that have benefited during the pandemic from the stay-at-home economy.<br />Still, extreme first-day pops in the share prices of  Airbnb Inc.  and other tech companies prompted some companies to delay their IPOs late last year for fear of missing out on billions of additional dollars. After shelving plans for an IPO in December, videogame company Roblox Corp. said last week that it raised $520 million on the private market and is planning a direct listing of its shares.<br />Affirm Chief Executive Max Levchin said that focusing on where its shares would trade on the first day is “another fine example of getting caught up in the frenzy for all the wrong reasons.”</td>

Mr. Gelsinger, who was once Intel’s technology chief, has served as CEO of the business-software provider since 2012.<br />The leadership transition unfolds after Intel last year ceded the title as America’s most valuable semiconductor company to rival  Nvidia Corp.  and fell further behind rivals in churning out the most advanced chips. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is also considering a broader embrace of third-party chip makers rather than relying on its own factories.<br />“This is incredibly important strategically to what Intel is looking to accomplish and be defined more as a technology innovator and operator,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group, a wealth-management firm that owns a stake in Intel through one of its funds.<br />Mr. Swan joined Intel in 2016 as chief financial officer.

The consumer wealth operations, including the CitiGold brand, were managed by the retail bank. Those offerings, which require a minimum balance of $50,000 in  Citigroup  accounts, generally served customers with as much as $10 million in assets.<br />By creating a unified Citi Global Wealth business, the bank’s executives are trying to serve customers along the entire spectrum. The idea is for the bank to get clients earlier and keep them as they grow richer, earning more fees in the process.<br />The combination bears the fingerprints of Ms. Fraser, who will take over when Mr. Corbat retires next month. Finding ways for the two parts of  Citigroup ,  its institutional and consumer businesses, to work more closely together is expected to be near the top of her agenda as CEO.</td>

And until recent years, lower courts had uniformly ruled that the FTC had the power to do so.<br />But many of the same justices also suggested the text of the relevant 1973 law, which gives the FTC the right to seek court injunctions against nefarious activity, doesn’t explicitly give it the right to seek financial judgments as well.<br />“If it is a mistake, it has been around for 50 years,” said Justice Stephen Breyer, adding that courts sometimes have to let “bygones be bygones.”<br />But Justice Breyer also said the FTC in recent years had been seeking to recover money in cases that weren’t necessarily egregious, which raised concerns about fairness to the business community.</td>

      <td>Intel Corp.  has returned to form with its new boss. But in many other ways, there may be no going back for the storied chip maker.<br />Intel announced Wednesday that Pat Gelsinger will take over the chief executive’s reins from Bob Swan, who’s effectively held the position for just two and a half years. That’s the shortest run of any Intel chief—about half the time of his immediate predecessor who was booted from the company following the discovery of an affair with a subordinate. Mr. Swan’s tenure was marked less by scandal and more by the other major problem he inherited—the loss of Intel’s position as the world’s most advanced chip manufacturer.<br />As an engineer with a 30-year stint at Intel under his belt, Mr. Gelsinger might seem more suited to addressing this problem. And his most recent job running VMware has made him a highly regarded leader in Silicon Valley. Intel’s share price jumped 7% Wednesday on the news, while VMware’s stock slipped by the same amount.<br />But Mr. Gelsinger is inheriting problems that have no quick fix. Intel’s struggles with advancing its chip-making process began before Mr. Swan came on board—and they have deepened since. The company disclosed in July that its latest process for manufacturing chips at 7 nanometers ran into new problems that would delay mass production on that process to late 2022. Rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC, is already making more advanced chips at 5 nanometers.<br />Being two generations behind a fast-moving rival has forced Intel to consider the rather unorthodox option of outsourcing the production of some of its most advanced chips to TSMC. That could help Intel close the manufacturing gap that has let  Advanced Micro Devices —another TSMC customer—pick up share in the PC and data center markets. But it would be a significant shift for a company that has long based its competitive advantage on being an integrated manufacturer.</td>

The moves came after Mr. Floyd, a Black man, was killed by police in May, inciting a national debate about systemic racism.<br />At the time, the companies said the money they pledged would go toward boosting the net worth of Black families, creating professional opportunities for minorities and diversifying their own ranks, among other outcomes.</td>

The new ban could have a significant impact especially in the apparel sector, which has already faced a number of customs restrictions amid concern about forced labor linked to the camps.<br />Beijing has denied such allegations and calls the camps vocational training centers. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington called the forced-labor allegations groundless and criticized Wednesday’s order as an attempt by the U.S. to suppress Xinjiang enterprises.</td>

      <td>We’re done with avoiding it. Indeed, we’re saving it, rendering it and using it to make all kinds of dishes more delicious.</td>
      <td>THERE’S NO fat-shaming in butchery. What some might consider a scrap is actually a kitchen asset.<br />As the cooking credo goes: Fat equals flavor. Science even proves it. “There is a growing body of research that supports fat as a sixth primary taste,” said Nik Sharma, author of “The Flavor Equation: The Science of Great Cooking Explained.” Mr. Sharma ranks what scientists are calling oleogustus—fattiness/richness—right up there with the sweet, sour, salty, bitter and savory experiences that make eating pleasurable. “Fat makes food taste delicious,” he simply explained.<br />Meat-eaters can go beyond the bottles of oil and butters on hand in their kitchens by rendering out the flavorful fat from scraps they’ve trimmed away from cuts of meat. “It is really cost-effective. You get the most out of what you are paying for,” said Aaron Rocchino, butcher/proprietor of the Local Butcher Shop in Berkeley, Calif. Mr. Rocchino encourages saving fat from pork, beef and poultry. Once you amass enough, you can render it by cooking slowly until the fat melts and separates from the meaty matter it’s attached to, leaving a flavorful liquid medium for all kinds of cooking.<br />A chef as well as a butcher, Mr. Rocchino worked in such esteemed kitchens as Le Bernardin in New York and Chez Panisse in Berkeley, where he honed his whole-animal butchering skills. Over the years he forged relationships with livestock farmers that eventually propelled him to his own butcher shop. The Local Butcher Shop opened in 2011 with the mission of providing restaurant-quality meat to retail customers while using as much of the animal as possible—fat and all. Beyond prime meat cuts, the shop carries everything from stock to dog food to those delicious rendered fats.<br />Whether poultry schmaltz, pork lard or beef tallow, rendered fat can take a dish from good to glorious. “Choosing the right fat is key, as different fats have different flavors and different smoking points too,” Mr. Rocchino said. Rule of thumb: The smaller the animal, the milder the flavor; the larger the animal, the stronger the flavor. Chicken, duck and goose schmaltz add a gentle richness without overpowering. They also don’t have a high smoking point, so it’s best to use schmaltz for binding matzo balls, as an enhancement to a pot of rice or a medium for slow-roasting vegetables. (Potatoes roasted in duck or goose fat = bliss.)</td>

      <td>An  Eastman Kodak Co.  director appears to have cut the size of his large and well-timed donation of  Kodak  stock to a religious charity, which came amid a sharp surge in the company’s stock price last year, according to a new securities filing.<br />In the Tuesday filing,  Kodak  director George Karfunkel said he donated two million of his 6.3 million  Kodak  shares on July 29, leaving him with about 4.4 million shares. The new document seemingly contradicts a securities filing from last August. The earlier filing showed Mr. Karfunkel and his wife on July 29 donated a significantly larger sum—three million Kodak shares—to Congregation Chemdas Yisroel in Brooklyn, N.Y., a charity Mr. Karfunkel helped found. That donation left the couple with about 3.3 million shares, the filing said.<br />Mr. Karfunkel and officials of the charity didn’t respond to requests for comment. A Kodak spokesman said the company doesn’t comment on financial transactions of board members.<br />The original donation occurred at a turbulent time for Kodak’s stock. On July 29, Kodak’s stock sharply surged and closed at its highest level since 2014. The Rochester, N.Y., company and a federal agency had just announced the onetime photography giant was in line to receive a $765 million loan from the White House to help manufacture drugs for the fight against coronavirus.<br />U.S. International Development Finance Corp. subsequently put the loan on hold after the deal came under congressional and regulatory scrutiny.</td>

      <td>Central bank’s business contacts downgrade characterization of economic activity following surge in Covid-19 cases</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. economy grew “modestly” in the final weeks of 2020, as a resurgence in Covid-19 cases prompted activity in some sectors to slow, a Federal Reserve report said Wednesday.<br />The Fed’s periodic compilation of anecdotes from business contacts, known as the Beige Book, provided the latest evidence that the pandemic dealt a setback to the economic recovery in recent months. Soaring infection rates and efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 also contributed to the U.S. labor market’s loss of 140,000 jobs in December, the first employment decline since the pandemic struck last spring, the Labor Department said Friday.<br />“Although the prospect of Covid-19 vaccines has bolstered business optimism for 2021 growth, this has been tempered by concern over the recent virus resurgence and the implications for near-term business conditions,” the central bank said Wednesday. The report said most Fed districts reported that economic activity increased modestly since the previous reporting period, but noted “conditions remained varied.”<br />Two of the Fed’s 12 districts reported no growth in recent weeks, while two others reported declines in activity.<br />The Fed’s characterization of economic conditions represented a downgrade from its previous Beige Book report, released Dec. 2, when policy makers described economic growth as “modest or moderate.” At that time, business contacts signaled the possibility of a potential slowdown given the surge in Covid-19 infections that was under way.</td>

John McCain, the latest sign of infighting in the state party.<br />The resolutions, which if passed would express disapproval but have no formal consequences, come as the state GOP is distancing itself from many of the Republican Party’s longtime establishment figures. The three censure resolutions easily passed the party’s resolution committee and will be brought before the entire state committee on Jan. 23.<br />The proposed censures for each person refer to what some party members say is executive overreach by Mr. Ducey in his response to the pandemic, Mrs. McCain’s support for same-sex marriage, and Mrs. McCain’s and Mr. Flake’s endorsements of President-elect Joe Biden in the 2020 election, among other things.<br />In a statement, Mrs. McCain criticized Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward and denounced what she described as continuous insults and personal attacks. “She’s shown how attacking Republicans like me can impact elections—her involvement in both Senate elections to replace Jeff Flake and my husband John McCain, two regular targets of her personal attacks, resulted in Democrat wins,” Mrs. McCain said. “As Chairman of the AZGOP she managed to turn Arizona blue in November for the first time since 1996.”<br />Ms. Ward, who is up for re-election to her post next Saturday, hasn’t said how she will vote on the censure resolutions, but she has been critical of the party’s establishment wing in the past. She ran against Mr. McCain for the GOP Senate nomination in 2016.</td>

A survey released last month by the appliance company Bosch found that more than half of us consider ourselves “obsessed” with the stuff, consuming more than 400 pounds, on average, in drinks a year.<br />Camper English, a self-proclaimed “ice guru,” certainly qualifies as obsessed. The San Francisco cocktail writer and author of the popular “Alcademics” cocktail blog has helped fuel a movement with a single-minded, glistening agenda: ensuring that anyone can make cocktail-bar-quality ice at home.<br />As Mr. English discovered in over 15 elaborate tests over the span of 18 years, making big ice is easy. Making clear ice isn’t. He has tried—and debunked—popular internet ice-making theories on achieving the much-coveted clarity. He froze distilled water. He boiled and then reboiled water from the tap before pouring it into molds. “I tried ridiculous experiments, like using carbonated water,” said Mr. English. “Which didn’t have a good chance of being the solution.” (It wasn’t.)<br />Eventually, he read Mariana Gosnell’s 2007 book, “Ice: The Nature, the History, and the Uses of an Astonishing Substance,” and in 2009, realized he could replicate the way a pond froze from the top down using a small Igloo cooler stashed in his freezer. It worked, ultimately inspiring a variety of products that apply the top-down freezing principle, but on a smaller scale. While Mr. English himself never managed to commoditize his breakthrough, he continues to consult and speak on the topic.<br />Here, five ways to keep your cool—for those who love munching on ice and others like Mr. English who seek true translucency.</td>

The proposed settlement with the FTC, if it becomes final following public comment, would require Flo Health to obtain an independent review of its privacy practices and get users’ consent before sharing their health information, the agency said. The company also must notify consumers of the FTC charges that it shared consumers’ personal information without their consent, commissioners said.<br />In a statement, a Flo spokesperson said the company cooperated with the FTC, adding, “We are committed to ensuring that the privacy of our users’ personal health data is absolutely paramount.”<br />The company emphasized that it didn’t share users’ names, addresses or birthdays, and that its agreement with the FTC wasn’t an admission of wrongdoing but allowed it to “avoid the time and expense of litigation and...decisively put this matter behind us.”</td>

Six months on, China has yet to reveal what it has found—or how much of the work it has done. A team of WHO specialists land in the city of Wuhan on Thursday on a mission to find out.<br />Under the plan, Chinese scientists would comb through hospital records, test samples of sewage and blood donations, interview early victims and map food and people at the market in Wuhan where most of the earliest cases were identified. WHO researchers say they don’t have a clear understanding of the progress made by Chinese scientists. Inside China, officials have said little about what studies or data its scientists plan to show the WHO team, or which sites it will visit.<br />“Many of them are excellent scientists, and they have been quite active, but it’s very difficult to get the full picture of what has been done,” said Fabian Leendertz, a member of the mission and a microbiologist who was able to pinpoint the bat-infested tree where West Africa’s 2014 Ebola epidemic likely began. “It makes sense to simply go there, sit all at one table together.”<br />The WHO has said its mission isn’t about placing blame. “Let’s see where are the gaps, why do they exist, are they technical or whatever, and make a plan to fill those gaps,” said Dr. Leendertz.<br />For months, the U.N. agency has negotiated with Beijing for permission to enter China, review research and formulate a plan for the next round of studies. Answers could help prevent a different coronavirus outbreak—and offer some sense of closure on how a pandemic that has sickened at least 92 million people and devastated the global economy began.</td>

      <td>The new  Netflix  adaptation of the racy “Bridgerton” books has put pop culture in a swoon, giving a mainstream stamp of approval to romance novels sometimes dismissed as trash and boosting a literary genre that has suffered setbacks in recent years.<br />“Bridgerton,” which debuted last month, is based on bestselling author Julia Quinn’s romance series set in the Regency era. The love story about a wayward duke and a high-society bachelorette starring a multiracial cast is projected to stream to more than 63 million households over its first four weeks, according to Netflix. The lavish show, which hit number one on the Netflix charts in 76 countries, has vaulted Ms. Quinn’s roughly 20-year-old novels to the top of the general fiction bestseller lists.<br />“Hollywood studios are full of male producers, directors, writers,” said Amy Pierpont, editor in chief of Forever and Forever Yours, romance imprints of Grand Central Publishing. “The idea that the same value that’s applied to superhero movies would be applied to stories that center around women’s lives has just not happened on a consistent basis.”<br />The success of “Bridgerton” couldn’t have come at a better time for the romance industry, which has been struggling to retain its power in the publishing world. Recent years have marked a steady decline in print and ebook sales of romance novels, which went from more than 98 million units sold in 2012 to 41 million in 2020, according to NPD BookScan, whose figures do not reflect sales of self-published titles.<br />Novelists, publishing executives and literary agents point to a range of challenges. Big retail chains have stopped putting as many mass-market paperbacks on their shelves, they say, while the consolidation of printing plants has complicated distribution efforts. Others say less expensive digital self-publishing has cut into sales by traditional publishers.</td>

The violations, a response to U.S. sanctions, have put at risk the survival of an agreement that helped remove sanctions on Iran and open it to business with the West.<br />The latest development emerged on Jan. 13 when the International Atomic Energy Agency told member states in a confidential report that Iran had told it in mid-December it planned to start producing uranium metal, a material vital for nuclear weapons. Iran says it is doing so for civilian purposes.<br />The disclosure came a week after Iran made one of its biggest steps yet to breach the 2015 deal, announcing it had begun enriching uranium at 20% purity. That crosses a red line European powers that are still party to the accord have previously set.<br />The most recent disclosure of plans to produce uranium metal—which has limited civilian utility—has stirred concern among Western officials over whether Iran is preparing to restart work toward a nuclear weapon.<br />Uranium metal is often used in the core of nuclear weapons. Production of the material, which hasn’t yet started, would be a clear breach of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers, in which it agreed to a 15-year moratorium on uranium and plutonium metallurgical production.</td>

      <td>ROME—Italy’s largest mafia trial in decades began Wednesday, as the country’s authorities try to rein in one of the world’s richest and most powerful crime syndicates, the ‘Ndrangheta.<br />The 325 defendants face charges including murder, extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering and other crimes in connection with the shadowy ‘Ndrangheta, whose wealth and international reach have eclipsed that of Sicily’s Cosa Nostra in recent decades.<br />The trial, which began with formalities on Wednesday, is taking place in a bunkerlike courtroom in the town of Lamezia Terme in Calabria, the ‘Ndrangheta’s home region in Italy’s deep South. Prosecutors hope it will mark a turning point in the fight against the ‘Ndrangheta by targeting the leadership of one of its most prominent clans and exposing how the organization has infiltrated local politics and business.<br />The ‘Ndrangheta has steadily risen to become one of the world’s most powerful drug-trafficking syndicates, controlling over 80% of Europe’s cocaine trade. Its tentacles extend to the Americas, Africa and Australia.<br />The organization’s estimated annual revenue of $55 billion, according to prosecutors, is greater than estimates for the drug cartels of Mexico and Colombia combined. It is thought to have some 20,000 members. Yet it remains much less well-known than the Cosa Nostra. Prosecutors hope the trial will reveal details of its internal structure and workings.</td>

      <td>The deficit totaled $3.3 trillion in calendar year 2020, roughly 15.8% of GDP, the Treasury Department said</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The federal budget gap widened in the first three months of the fiscal year, as government spending continued to outpace revenues while the economy slowly recovers from the pandemic-induced downturn.<br />The U.S. Treasury Department said Wednesday the deficit from October through December totaled a record $573 billion, a 61% increase from the same period a year earlier. Federal outlays rose 18%, to $1.4 trillion, driven higher primarily by automatic safety-net spending such as jobless benefits, nutrition assistance and health care. Total receipts held steady, at $803 billion, the Treasury said.<br />For the 12 months that ended in December, the government ran a $3.3 trillion deficit, more than triple the shortfall a year earlier and roughly 15.8% of U.S. gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output.<br />Government spending surged last year as Congress authorized several measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic and cushion the U.S. economy from recession, and federal revenues declined as businesses closed and millions of Americans lost their jobs. The Labor Department said last week the U.S. lost 140,000 jobs last month, ending a seven-month streak of job creation as virus outbreaks across the country prompted a new round of business restrictions.<br />Lawmakers authorized another $908 billion economic relief package last month, but Treasury officials said the government didn’t begin distributing the money—including stimulus checks—until this month, and it isn’t reflected in the figures released Wednesday.</td>

      <td>OVER THE past year, as many Americans began working from home—and letting their style standards dip—fashion and footwear brands from  Nike  to Gucci began pumping out inviting, slide-on shoes. Many were peculiar, backless models. These “you don’t even need to lift your heel” mules might suit a life of slovenly at-home shuffling. But are any stylish enough to wear outside? Men’s fashion editor Jacob Gallagher and sports columnist Jason Gay debate the issue.<br />Jason: Can we talk about slippers? Sweatpants and hoodies dominated spring quarantine-chic, but now that it’s winter, it’s all about slippers. Slippers are the new sweatpants. Discuss.<br />Jacob: Slippers keep you warm. That’s the practical justification but here’s the truth: We’ve all become lazy. Tying laces? That’s a chore. And no one’s going anywhere fancy. So slippers carry the day. Shuffle out in them to the store. No one will judge you.<br />Jason: Slippers are a blissfully lazy option. And I was perfectly capable of being lazy before the pandemic—I was lazy before it was cool. However, to me, a slipper is strictly a stay-at-home option. You can wear slides outside, but a slipper is never-touches-pavement footwear. Once a slipper goes outside, it’s ruined. Jacob, are you wandering around the supermarket in slippers?<br />Jacob: Never in true slippers, but in summer I did wear pool slides inside and out. I’ve since moved on to closed-toed, backless rubber Birkenstocks, which have proved warmer. They’re enticingly lazy, but if your vision is bad enough they kinda look like loafers. At least, that’s what I tell myself. Where do you fall on mules like that?</td>

The IAEA said Tehran had given it no timeline for when it would do so. Still, the development brings Iran closer to crossing the line between nuclear operations with a potential civilian use, such as enriching nuclear fuel for power-generating reactors, and nuclear-weapons work, something Tehran has long denied ever carrying out.<br />Iran’s ambassador to the IAEA, Kazem Gharib Abadi, said Wednesday on Twitter that Iran would produce uranium metal, saying it would allow the development of a new fuel for the Tehran civilian research reactor. Iran has said it would take four to five months to install the equipment to produce a uranium powder from which uranium metal is made.</td>

Their 2020 season ended meekly, almost two weeks ago, with a modest triumph over the calamitous Jets. It was New England’s seventh win against nine losses, the franchise’s first losing record in 20 years.<br />Not very good. Not at all Patriots.<br />Still, Belichick expected to be busy this week. He was supposed to be in Washington, D.C., to be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, from the outgoing President Trump. As everyone knows now, he won’t. On Monday, word arrived that Belichick was declining the medal. In a statement, Belichick made reference to the “tragic events” last week at the U.S. Capitol, and said “remaining true to the people, team and country I love outweigh the benefits of any individual award.”<br />Now Belichick has an empty spot in his calendar. The taciturn coach, who coined workplace-fetish phrases like “Do Your Job” and once chanted “No days off!” at a championship celebration, has given himself an uncharacteristic gift: free time.</td>

On Wednesday, Turkey granted emergency approval to the vaccine, and the Philippines said that it still planned to use it as a part of its inoculation campaign.<br />“Differences in efficacy and choosing the highest efficacy aren’t the primary base of vaccine access in Indonesia,” said Penny Lukito, head of Indonesia’s National Agency of Drug and Food Control. Other important factors included finding vaccines that can be easily and safely distributed, she said.<br />In China, health regulators said on Wednesday that the country had already administered more than 10 million vaccine doses since Dec. 15, including an unspecified number from Sinovac, and was ramping up production capacity to distribute more.</td>

      <td>An Aaron Sorkin film celebrates the Chicago Seven for plotting an attack on a party convention.</td>
      <td>The Chicago Seven were countercultural heroes in the 1960s. They thumbed their noses through one of the country’s most notorious political trials, taunting the judge and making a mockery of the proceedings with flippant courtroom pranks. Aaron Sorkin wrote and directed a movie about them last year, “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” which will probably win a few Oscars.<br />One thing people forget about the Chicago Seven is that most of them were guilty. Jerry Rubin admitted as much later: “We wanted disruption. We planned it. . . . We were guilty as hell. Guilty as charged.”<br />The crime they were accused of was crossing state lines to incite a riot. The defendants believed that Vice President Hubert Humphrey’s 1968 nomination for presidency was illegitimate. Nominations in those days were decided not by primaries but by backroom deals among party power brokers. The antiwar movement believed that a more democratic process would have produced a candidate opposed to the Vietnam War.<br />The question was whether the violent clashes between protesters and police outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago were an unfortunate consequence of peaceful marching that got out of hand, or whether the organizers intended for things to get violent.<br />In February 1970, a jury convicted the five ringleaders—Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, Tom Hayden, David Dellinger and Rennie Davis. Peaceful protest is one thing, but attempting to disrupt a legitimate election procedure by violent intimidation is never acceptable. After last week’s incursion at the Capitol, can the rest of us finally agree?</td>

Poshmark sellers list everything from $17 reusable Starbucks cups to $3,000 Louis Vuitton handbags. While many traditional apparel companies struggled to survive, Poshmark was profitable for the first time in its 10-year history during the quarter that ended June 30.<br />Poshmark is expected to price its IPO on Wednesday. It has set a price range of $35 to $39, giving the company a valuation of roughly $2.7 billion at the midpoint of that range. The business was valued at $1.25 billion in 2019. Poshmark declined to comment, citing a regulatory quiet period ahead of its IPO.<br />The Redwood City, Calif.-based company follows  ContextLogic Inc.,  the parent of e-commerce marketplace Wish, which has traded below its IPO price of $24 after a rocky debut last month. The investor skepticism is an anomaly in an otherwise booming IPO market that has seen sky-high valuations and large gains from tech companies including  Airbnb Inc.  and  DoorDash Inc.</td>

Millions of users flocked to the chat apps in recent weeks, according to data from Apptopia and Sensor Tower. There are a few factors behind the surge.<br />One is concern over a privacy-policy update for the  Facebook Inc. -owned WhatsApp. Meanwhile, the deplatforming of President Trump from prominent social networks following the U.S. Capitol riot has driven people to seek communication tools without moderators and external visibility.<br />On Jan. 7,  Tesla Inc.  Chief Executive Elon Musktweeted, “Use Signal.” A subsequent flood of users caused the app’s phone-number verification system  to break temporarily. Days later,  Twitter Inc.  CEO Jack Dorseypublished a screenshot of Signal at the top of the App Store charts, along with a heart emoji. At the same time, influential accounts on Parler, the social network popular among conservatives, called on followers to move to Telegram. Donald Trump Jr. actively posts in a public channel on the app.<br />What do Signal and Telegram have in common? Both are chat apps that offer end-to-end encryption outside of Big Tech’s grasp. Encrypted messaging apps like Signal and Telegram can offer more security, privacy and features than plain text messaging—but their encryption methods and data collection vary. Meanwhile, WhatsApp and  Apple Inc.’s  iMessage also offer end-to-end encryption, but within their respective ecosystems.<br />Here’s how to choose an encrypted chat app, and why you might want to.</td>

      <td>European inflation expectations are rising as investors anticipate ongoing easy monetary policy and a global economic rebound boosted by U.S. fiscal spending.<br />The closely watched 5-year 5-year forward inflation swap rate for the euro area rose above 1.35% Tuesday, the highest in over a year. It continued to hover near that level Wednesday. The metric shows an average expectation for price increases over five years.<br />“This is quite a remarkable move, it has surprised us,” said Jorge Garayo, a rates and inflation strategist at  Société Générale .<br />Forecasts for higher prices are playing out in the bond market. Germany’s 10-year break-even rate, or the difference in yield between its benchmark bond and a price level-linked bond, climbed above 1% for the first time since February. Italy’s equivalent rate hit a more-than two-year high. Essentially, a higher break-even rate suggests investors expect prices to rise faster.<br />“With the onset of vaccines, people are upgrading their growth outlooks,” said  UBS  rates strategist Rohan Khanna.</td>

      <td>Price gains remain muted, but only because services demand is still depressed by the Covid-19 crisis</td>
      <td>The things that have kept inflation low during the Covid-19 crisis are a lot different than the ones that used to keep it low. A whipsawing of prices when the pandemic passes is something to look out for.<br />The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that U.S. consumer prices rose 0.4% in December from November, putting them 1.4% above their year earlier level. Core prices, which exclude food and energy items to better capture inflation’s trend, rose 0.1% from November, and were up 1.6% on the year.<br />The Federal Reserve’s aim is for 2% inflation, and the consumer price measures it follows run cooler than the Labor Department’s.<br />Under inflation’s hood, though, there are some big shifts. Prices for food at home—groceries and the like—remain elevated as a result of the pandemic, and were up 3.9% in December from a year earlier. Meanwhile, prices for lodging at hotels and the like were down 11.2%.<br />Those are reflections of a broader trend in which goods prices have risen on the back of stronger demand during the pandemic while services inflation has cooled substantially. Core goods prices were up 1.7% on the year last month, which compared with a December 2019 gain of 0.1%. Core services prices were up 1.6%, which compared with a December 2019 gain of 3%.</td>
