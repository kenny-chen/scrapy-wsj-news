      <td>Stone and Manafort played instrumental roles in president’s political rise; Charles Kushner is also among those pardoned</td>
      <td>President Trump issued 26 more pardons on Wednesday, granting clemency to individuals including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, longtime adviser Roger Stone and Charles Kushner, his son-in-law’s father.<br />Mr. Trump, who used the clemency power only sparingly early in his term, appears to be freely exercising it in his final weeks in office to grant reprieves to allies and associates in his political orbit. In addition to the acts of clemency announced this week, last month he pardoned his former national-security adviser Mike Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<br />Messrs. Stone and Manafort played instrumental roles in the president’s political rise, with Mr. Manafort serving as his campaign chairman in 2016 and Mr. Stone acting as a longtime political confidant. Both men were charged as part of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The elder Mr. Kushner served more than two years in prison.<br />An analysis by Harvard Law professor and former Justice Department official Jack Goldsmith found that 60 of the 65 pardons Mr. Trump granted before Wednesday went to individuals with personal or political connections to the president. Mr. Trump has bypassed the normal Justice Department process for reviewing pardons, frequently hearing appeals for clemency directly from celebrities or other friends, business associates or political allies.<br />Mr. Trump has also granted pardons to former law-enforcement officials accused of wrongdoing, as well as numerous political figures accused of crime, including campaign-finance violations. On Tuesday, he pardoned 15 others, among them three former Republican congressmen and several former military contractors convicted of wartime killing of Iraqi civilians.</td>

Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, compete with domestic rivals  JD.com Inc.  and  Pinduoduo Inc.<br />Alibaba didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Ma couldn't immediately be reached for comment. JD.com and Pinduoduo didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment.<br />China’s central bank and three other regulators, meantime, said in a separate joint statement that they would summon Ant for talks. Ant acknowledged in a statement that it had received a meeting notice from the regulators, adding that it would “seriously study and strictly comply with all regulatory requirements.”</td>

      <td>Personal gift-giving, as opposed to communal merry-making, is a recent development, but the logic of charity at Christmas is perennial.</td>
      <td>If, on Christmas morning, you discover that Santa surprised you with a copy of “The Oxford Handbook of Christmas,” what might you expect? Something like “The Boy Scout Handbook,” a compendium of useful information about preserving eggnog or tying bows rather than knots? Or perhaps a religious handbook for the season that includes daily prayers and spiritual exercises?<br />Fortunately, since such books would, by Christmas Day, be pointless for the next 11 months, this vast collection, edited by Timothy Larsen—an expert in Victorian religious life—offers stimulating essays on what might be called Christmasness; thus it will be ever timely. Roughly four-dozen writers (mostly scholars and theologians) take up the history, theology, worship, global traditions and artistic creations surrounding Christmas.<br />Much of what is on offer conjures Thomas Cranmer’s encouragement in the Book of Common Prayer to “read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest.” Consider one simple element in the nativity scene from the Gospel of Luke (aka Linus’s big speech in “A Charlie Brown Christmas”): the swaddling clothes. Here they are unwrapped to reveal layers of meaning. Some are literal: Greeks, Romans and Jews, we learn, swaddled their young—wrapped their babies tightly in strips of cloth—but not the Spartans. Other meanings are scriptural: In Job, God enwraps the sea, “thick darkness its swaddling band.” Luke’s phrase can also be seen as a comment on pagan myth: Rhea swaddles a stone to trick the infanticidal Kronos into swallowing it rather than their child Zeus. Then there are the meanings that refer to salvation: Jesus’ swaddling clothes prefigure his freeing us from death’s winding sheets.<br />Luke may be specific about the infant Christ’s wrappings, but, as the opening to the handbook’s New Testament section notes: “Scripture supplies no stable, donkey, three kings, or numerous other props of seasonal children’s pageants.” The Gospel of Matthew reveals the place of Jesus’ birth and Luke allows us to calculate the year, but the exact date is unknowable. By about A.D. 200, there were at least four estimates, ranging from January to May—but nothing in December. How did Christmas land on Dec. 25? The theologian Paul F. Bradshaw is as artfully forensic as Hercule Poirot, eliminating the usual suspects, such as the dates inherited from pagan holidays. “The weakness” of one theory, he dryly remarks, was that its author “was unable to produce any firm evidence in support of it.” He leans toward the scholars who explain Dec. 25 by showing long-ago attempts to date Christ’s conception to late March.<br />Dorothy Sayers once said that Christmas had become “barnacled about with sentimental accretions.” She worried that banalities would dull the shock of the Incarnation. For the scholars in “The Oxford Handbook of Christmas,” all the accreted layers are interesting. Take gifts, for instance. The first Christmas present was, of course, Jesus himself: “For God so loved the world, that he gave His only begotten Son.” But personal gift-giving (as opposed to communal merry-making) is a recent development, coinciding with industrialization (more stuff to buy) but not limited to it: The 5-year-old Laura Ingalls received both store-bought peppermint candy and homemade red mittens. Louisa May Alcott’s “Little Women” begins during the Civil War with unhappy teens: “Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents!” But then they bring their Christmas dinner to a poor German immigrant family, an act of kindness that inspires the rich man next door to send Christmas treats to them in turn. Charitable traditions at Christmas now encompass people of all faiths and none.</td>

      <td>When Saul of Tarsus set out on his journey to Damascus the whole of the known world lay in bondage. There was one state, and it was Rome. There was one master for it all, and he was Tiberius Caesar.<br />Everywhere there was civil order, for the arm of the Roman law was long. Everywhere there was stability, in government and in society, for the centurions saw that it was so.<br />But everywhere there was something else, too. There was oppression—for those who were not the friends of Tiberius Caesar. There was the tax gatherer to take the grain from the fields and the flax from the spindle to feed the legions or to fill the hungry treasury from which divine Caesar gave largess to the people. There was the impressor to find recruits for the circuses. There were executioners to quiet those whom the Emperor proscribed. What was a man for but to serve Caesar?<br />There was the persecution of men who dared think differently, who heard strange voices or read strange manuscripts. There was enslavement of men whose tribes came not from Rome, disdain for those who did not have the familiar visage. And most of all, there was everywhere a contempt for human life. What, to the strong, was one man more or less in a crowded world?<br />Then, of a sudden, there was a light in the world, and a man from Galilee saying, Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s.</td>

      <td>His vetoes could cost Republicans the two Jan. 5 Georgia runoffs.</td>
      <td>President Trump is leaving office as he entered, with a whirlwind of action that gets more attention than it accomplishes. He may also take down his party’s chances of winning the Senate runoffs on Jan. 5. Does he care?<br />On Wednesday Mr. Trump vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that passed the House and Senate with overwhelming votes. He said the bill doesn’t include the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that provides liability protection for online platforms.<br />“Section 230 facilitates the spread of foreign disinformation online, which is a serious threat to our national security and election integrity. It must be repealed,” Mr. Trump said in a veto statement. The bigger threat to security is the recent Russian hack of the U.S. government, not social media companies.<br />Mr. Trump’s real objection is that  Twitter  and other tech giants are progressive outfits that block or restrict conservative content. On that he is often right, and Section 230 shouldn’t be immune from scrutiny. But repealing it wholesale, without debate, in a year-end defense bill is self-destructive. The only sure beneficiary would be the plaintiffs bar. Twitter and other tech platforms might become more censorious, not less, and conservatives aren’t likely to be favored in that scrum.<br />The NDAA isn’t perfect, but it extends hazard pay for U.S. forces that is set to expire at the end of the year. Mr. Trump’s statement called the bill a “gift” to China and Russia. But we doubt China will see it that way, since it establishes a Pacific Deterrence Initiative that authorizes $2.2 billion for, among other things, putting more military assets in China’s backyard and conducting exercises with allies. The bill also includes an overhaul of the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent, as well as cybersecurity provisions to protect command and control of U.S. nuclear systems.</td>

      <td>A top journal retracts a study following a political outcry.</td>
      <td>In 2020 scientific publications have leapt into the political fray. Scientific American gave its first ever Presidential endorsement to Joe Biden, declaring that Donald Trump “rejects evidence and science.” The New England Journal of Medicine said in a pre-election editorial that “our current leaders have undercut trust in science.”<br />But if populist politicians undercut trust in science, sometimes they are aided by science’s own institutions. Consider the controversy over a now-retracted paper in the prestigious science journal Nature Communications, which shows how political fashions can dictate what research outcomes are acceptable.<br />In November three NYU Abu Dhabi researchers came under fire for an article questioning the popular academic view that young women scientists are better off with female mentors. Their “science of science” study analyzed the impact of millions of scientific papers with junior and senior authors and drew conclusions about the effect of mentorship on careers.<br />“While current diversity policies encourage same-gender mentorships to retain women in academia,” the paper says in the abstract, “our findings raise the possibility that opposite-gender mentorship may actually increase the impact of women who pursue a scientific career.”<br />The authors—two of whom are women—pointed to possible explanations for their findings, including that “historically, male scientists had enjoyed more privileges and access to resources than their female counterparts.”</td>

      <td>Congress approves a deal to draw the country from its terror-supporting past.</td>
      <td>Congress approved the Sudan Claims Resolution Act this week, and our only complaint is that it took so long. The Trump Administration produced a transformative deal with Khartoum, but extended haggling on Capitol Hill needlessly endangered the fragile Sudanese government.<br />Sudan’s long-time dictator fell last year, and the transitional government is acting boldly to move on. A quarter century after the country hosted Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, the State Department negotiated an accord to restore the country’s sovereign immunity and lift its state sponsor of terrorism designation. In exchange, the Sudanese government agreed to normalize ties with Israel and pay $335 million to victims of the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings.<br />America’s foes should take note. Sudan was antagonistic for decades and responsible for American deaths. But it agreed to change and negotiated in good faith. It is behaving like a normal country, and its economy will benefit accordingly. Access to international finance, and to multilateral institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, will bring the previously isolated nation new avenues for commerce.<br />The opportunity to turn a terror-sponsoring state into a productive partner doesn’t come often, and the Trump Administration deserves credit for seizing it. So does most of Congress, where the deal received bipartisan support. But Senators Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Robert Menendez (D., N.J.) delayed passage for months, claiming the deal was bad for 9/11 victims’ families. One of the offers they called a compromise included an unrelated gift-basket for trial lawyers.<br />The bill that finally passed restores Sudan’s sovereign immunity generally but allows 9/11 victims’ families to pursue litigation in federal court. The cases could put Sudan on the hook for billions, but they’re unlikely to succeed. The law also includes $700 million in aid to the country and more than $200 million in loans.</td>

      <td>In the 1840s, Dickens didn’tsee how businessmen like his hero were already lifting mankind from poverty.</td>
      <td>No Christmas story except the biblical account of Jesus’ birth has been more often retold or more cherished than Charles Dickens’s “A Christmas Carol,” published in 1843. The reclamation of Ebenezer Scrooge has brought joy and hope to hundreds of millions of people across three centuries. “Scrooge” has become an eponym for stingy or miserly. We write in defense of this Ebenezer Scrooge, not the redeemed one.<br />Scrooge is a distilled caricature of a businessman in the Victorian era: a rich, obsessive wealth hoarder. Working in “his moldy old office,” living in “his dusty chambers” in a building so old and dreary that “nobody lived in it but Scrooge,” he was “a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone.” He strove from dawn till dusk to “understand his own business,” and “with his banker’s-book” he trudged home in the dark “to take his gruel” alone by a dying fire.<br />We meet Scrooge on Christmas Eve, when he is visited in his cold, dingy “counting-house” by his nephew, who urges him to stop working: “You’re rich enough.” The young man begs his uncle to join him in making merry on Christmas Day. Concerned about finding himself “a year older, but not an hour richer,” Scrooge answers that he will keep Christmas in his own way, by working.<br />It should be understood there is nothing unethical about Ebenezer Scrooge. In his view business “is the even-handed dealing of the world,” and “there is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty.” His great failing, in the words of his former fiancée, whom he gave up to marry his business, was that he had become a prisoner of “the master-passion, Gain.”<br />Scrooge’s reclamation begins on Christmas Eve when the ghost of his dead partner, Jacob Marley, visits to tell of his “life’s opportunity misused.” When Scrooge recalls his partner was “always a good man of business,” Marley’s ghost cries out “Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business: charity, mercy, forbearance and benevolence were all my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business.”</td>

      <td>One lesson is that hostility motivates voters as much as enthusiasm does.</td>
      <td>Parties often conduct autopsies after losing elections. Since Democrats and Republicans alike gained and lost so much this difficult and bizarre year, both need sober after-action reviews.<br />Democrats won the White House but not the Senate. They also suffered surprising and significant losses in the House. Republicans have the upper hand in keeping the Senate, gained impressively in the House, kept their redistricting edge by turning back a well-funded Democratic effort to flip state legislatures. But they forfeited the presidency.<br />So what lessons can each party take from 2020?<br />One is that money can’t buy victory. Democrats outspent Republicans in every seriously contested Senate race yet flipped only Arizona and Colorado. Democrats showered $132.7 million on South Carolina’s Jaime Harrison against Sen. Lindsey Graham, who raised $109.3 million. Mr. Graham won by 10 points. Kentucky’s Amy McGrath, a Marine veteran, received $96.3 million for her bid against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose bankroll was $69.9 million. He won by 19.6 points.<br />Money also can’t buy a compelling message. In many races, Democrats had little more to say than that their Republicans opponents didn’t care about people with pre-existing conditions and were lackeys for President Trump.</td>

The International Olympic Committee announced the decision Dec. 7.<br />The other sport to be introduced in France will be breakdancing, which started in the 1970s with African-American and Hispanic street youth dancing, spinning and twirling to hip-hop and rap music. The IOC has been pushing to include urban events like breakdancing to entice younger viewers. But is breakdancing really a sport?<br />The committee has changed its mind on sports in the past. In February 2013 the IOC announced it would remove Greco-Roman wrestling, which dates back to the original Olympics in ancient Athens, from competition in 2020. A massive public outcry ensued, and the decision was reversed that September.<br />Meanwhile, some fascinating and unusual examples of Olympic events have been held and discontinued. Tug of war was an Olympic medal sport starting with the second modern Olympics, in 1900, but was eliminated after 1920. Why not bring it back? Working together as a team to build up strength, endurance and precision perfectly fits with the Olympic spirit.<br />Some events gave out medals that have still never been established as official or unofficial by the IOC. Professional and volunteer firefighters competed in 1900. Angling was contested, with 600 fishermen (mostly from France) participating in six competitions.</td>

      <td>From a Dec. 20 Associated Press dispatch:<br /><br />As COVID-19 cases skyrocketed before the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus response, warned Americans to “be vigilant” and limit celebrations to “your immediate household.” . . .<br />The day after Thanksgiving, she traveled to one of her vacation properties on Fenwick Island in Delaware. She was accompanied by three generations of her family from two households. . . .<br />Birx’s own experiences underline the complexity and difficulty of trying to navigate the perils of the pandemic while balancing a job, family and health, especially among essential workers like her.</td>

      <td>A keyboard masterpiece depends on the complex relationship between sound waves and musical notes.</td>
      <td>Mathematician Eugenia Cheng explores the uses of math beyond the classroom. Read more columns here.<br />Along with my usual chocolate Advent calendar, this year I decided to make myself a kind of musical Advent calendar by playing through a book of J.S. Bach’s “The Well-Tempered Keyboard,” a monumental collection of 24 preludes and fugues. Playing one a day made a perfect fit with my chocolates and the run-up to Christmas Eve.<br />Bach didn’t choose the number 24 arbitrarily. In Western music there are 12 notes in an octave, and for each note there is a major and a minor key, making 24 in total. To understand why there are 12 notes in an octave, rather than 10 or 14, we have to look at the math of sound waves.<br />The pitch of a note is determined by the frequency of its sound wave—that is, how many identical segments of the wave, or oscillations, pass a fixed point in a given period of time. The higher the frequency of a sound wave, the higher the pitch it produces. Harmony in music involves combining sound waves of different frequencies, making use of the fact that some waves reinforce one another while others interfere.<br />For any musical note, the note that goes with it most harmoniously is the same note one octave higher. That’s because the higher note has exactly twice the frequency, leading the two sound waves to oscillate together neatly. The next most harmonious note will be the one with three times the frequency, which in musical terms is a perfect fifth higher—for instance, the jump from C to G, which you can hear at the beginning of “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.”</td>

The worker, who wasn’t identified, is in stable condition, officials said.<br />A spokesman for the city’s health department didn’t provide further information about the worker. The department is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track other side effects of the vaccine, officials said.<br />“We’ll continue to follow up on those events and make sure that we’re taking it seriously,” Dave Chokshi, the city’s health commissioner, said at a news conference Wednesday. He added that the severe adverse reaction was uncommon and that the vaccines are very safe overall.<br />As of Dec. 18, there have been six reports of allergic reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech shot in the U.S., according to the CDC. More than 272,000 doses of the vaccine had been administered by that time.</td>

      <td>U.S. government-bond prices fell Wednesday as investors reacted to signs that U.K. and European Union officials were closing in on a new trade accord that would avoid tariffs being imposed at the start of next year.<br />In recent trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 0.960%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 0.917% Tuesday.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, initially declined early in the overnight session after President Trump criticized the roughly $900 billion coronavirus relief deal passed by Congress, raising questions about whether he might veto the legislation.<br />Yields, though, later reversed course and rose sharply in response to headlines that the U.K and EU might reach a trade deal as early as Wednesday. Absent a deal, tariffs would be applied Jan. 1 for the first time in nearly 50 years on some trade between the U.K. and the EU, causing an unwelcome economic disruption as countries are struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.<br />More directly impacted by the trade news, yields on European government bonds also climbed, with the 10-year German bond yield rising to minus 0.541% from minus 0.589% and the 10-year U.K. yield jumping to 0.285% from 0.186%.

      <td>Regarding Allysia Finley’s op-ed “Now We’re Cooking With Gas. But Tomorrow?” (Dec. 17): Forbidding natural-gas connections in new buildings ensures that more, not less, natural gas will be consumed to meet the new demand for electricity. Similarly, government mandates for electric vehicles, space heating and cooking will increase the total amount of natural gas burned.<br />Natural gas consumed as a fuel to heat or cook is more than 90% efficient, while electricity produced from natural gas is at best 60% efficient. This means that boiling a pot of water on an electric stove uses 150% as much natural gas as a gas stove. This is before any consideration is given to the inefficiencies of induction heating or losses in transmission.<br />On the other hand, if all U.S. homes were required to burn natural gas for space heating and cooking, the total amount of natural gas consumed nationwide would probably decline, with the added benefit of increasing the proportion of U.S. energy sourced from renewables.

      <td>Unusual nature of this recession suggests it could lead to more rapid recovery than others</td>
      <td>Our Covid winter has begun on a grim note: Job growth is stalling, consumer spending is wilting, and a fast-spreading virus strain has raised the prospect of crippling new lockdowns.<br />Yet after this most unusual of years, there are three good reasons to think next year will be better—perhaps much better than you think. It all comes down to the unique character of both the recession and the policy response.<br />Most recessions begin when rising interest rates or stressed financial markets undercut demand for goods and services, driving up unemployment, which further crimps demand. This one began with a natural disaster, like a hurricane or earthquake, which interrupts the supply of goods and services.<br />When a disaster of that sort ends, a V-shaped recovery ensues. But this disaster, the most widespread and longest lasting in a century, isn’t over. There was a partial V-shaped recovery in the third quarter as lockdowns were lifted. But since the pandemic was never brought under control, restrictions and social distancing never ended and indeed have recently tightened.<br />Those restrictions are repressing consumer spending. IHS Markit estimates personal consumption is running 7% below its fundamental level as dictated by wages and salaries, government payments, wealth, interest rates, taxes and demographics. In the 2007-09 recession, it ran close to or above its fundamental level.</td>

Virtually all took and passed multiple Advanced Placement exams. The average SAT scores were 654 on math and 611 on verbal, compared with 475 and 485 for a similar national demographic. Depending on one’s view of Success Academy—and charter schools in general—these facts suggest either an aspirational view that ZIP Codes need not determine educational excellence or a cynical view that 2,500 teachers and 20,000 kids and their families have joined a cult obsessed with producing outsize test scores.<br />Beyond the numbers, my first reaction to these essays was that they were all well-written (I even learned a new word: heteroglossia). It is fair to point out that, as a sine laude high school graduate, I am neither Strunk nor White in authoritative assessment of writing skill. Still, I have read enough bad essays to recognize a good one. Uniformly, these essays were clear, concise, grammatically correct and properly punctuated.<br />I’ve spent plenty of time with college admissions directors. They are on the whole thoughtful and committed professionals. Many also have a sardonic sense of humor, which helps when reading and evaluating thousands of essays. One Ivy League admissions director describes how insiders distill recurrent themes to a word or two. “Costa Rica” refers to the propensity of well-to-do high school juniors to embark on eco-tours of Central American countries. “Grandma” points to the lionization of elders—a noble sentiment, but as my friend wryly noted, grandma isn’t applying to college, you are. “Soup kitchen” captures the idea that two weeks’ work at the shelter doesn’t make you Mother Teresa.<br />A Success Academy scholar is as likely to live in a homeless shelter as to work in one. Gap years would more likely be devoted to caring for an autistic sibling than tending Costa Rican flora and fauna. Simple heuristics wouldn’t prove helpful in vetting a Success Academy class for college admission.</td>

      <td>Pharmaceutical companies and Trump’s Operation Warp Speed deserve the vast bulk of the credit.</td>
      <td>With the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, a light has appeared in the darkness. A hard winter lies ahead, but this pandemic will soon be over.<br />How can this be happening only 10 months after the first Covid death in the U.S., rather than the 10 years it took to develop a vaccine for measles? Nine months ago, Anthony Fauci stated unambiguously: “It will take at least a year and a half to have a vaccine we can use.” The public-health community dismissed that as a fantasy. A co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine, Paul Offit, noted: “When Dr. Fauci said 12 to 18 months, I thought that was ridiculously optimistic.” A  New York Times vaccine timeline went further, declaring: “The grim truth behind this rosy forecast is that a vaccine probably won’t arrive any time soon.”<br />Those naysayers have been proved wrong and it’s worth considering why. Let me invite the reader to answer a short quiz. When in the months ahead you are vaccinated, to whom should you be most thankful for making this possible?<br />• The initiative forwarded by the United Nations, Group of 20, World Health Organization and COVAX—an affiliate of WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations—that called for “a ‘people’s vaccine’ available and affordable for everyone, everywhere,” in the words of U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres?<br />• Foundations and donors, including the consortium led by the Gates Foundation that established the CEPI (the “alliance to finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines”) at Davos, Switzerland, in 2017?</td>

      <td>FCC sale of wireless licenses has already hit new spending highs and the total could climb after a holiday break</td>
      <td>The Federal Communications Commission’s ongoing sale of wireless licenses has fetched more than $69.8 billion after three weeks of bidding, a record sum that could alter cellphone carriers’ prospects for the next decade.<br />The auction proceeds have already topped the $44.9 billion raised in 2015 by an earlier sale of midrange cellular licenses, which U.S. cellphone carriers used at the time to enhance their 4G service. Those companies are now investing billions of dollars in the next wave of fifth-generation coverage. The 5G standard promises to speed the flow of data to phones and other wireless devices like personal computers, cars and industrial machinery.<br />The recent bids have blown past Wall Street’s highest forecasts, suggesting that several companies are fighting over the most valuable wireless rights. The 5G auction kicked off Dec. 8 and will pause for the holidays until Jan. 4, when total bids could move even higher.<br />Each bid is swathed in secrecy until the auction process ends. Analysts expect big names like  AT&T Inc.  and  Verizon Communications Inc.  to walk away with a large share of the licenses to match assets that rival T-Mobile US Inc. captured with its February takeover of Sprint.<br />“Mid-band spectrum will be where 5G lives,” said Walt Piecyk, a telecom analyst for research firm LightShed Partners. He added that T-Mobile’s merger with Sprint “clearly put pressure on Verizon and AT&T” to match their rival’s war chest.</td>

Gift card sales jumped 48% last weekend, compared with earlier in the week, as deadlines for free shipping with guaranteed Christmas delivery expired, according to Rise.ai, which manages electronic gift card programs for more than 5,000 brands, including Allbirds and Milk Bar.<br />Tim Maynard has already spent nearly $300 on gift cards this year at retailers ranging from  Amazon.com Inc.  to  Target Corp.  to  Home Depot Inc.  In past years, the 32-year-old financial analyst said he shied away from giving the cards because they felt impersonal.<br />“It was sort of a last resort this year,” said the St. Clair, Mo., resident. “Not having the ability to get in stores and see things makes it hard to buy gifts.”</td>

      <td>Consumer spending and incomes could take hit, as business restrictions aim to curb surge of infections</td>
      <td>The U.S. economy has entered an odd sort of limbo—slowing, as it ends an unusually rough year, but with a possibly stronger recovery looming ahead.<br />The latest economic readings, due out Wednesday, are expected to show that U.S. households cut spending in November, which would be the first drop since April, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The Commerce Department report is also projected to show a drop in household income last month, as the effects of federal-aid programs earlier this year fade. A separate report by the Labor Department is expected to show another rise in weekly jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs.<br />Businesses across the U.S. have been forced to shut or scale back operations in recent weeks, as states and cities try to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Economic growth appears to have slowed this winter as a result.<br />Consumer spending—the linchpin of growth in the world’s largest economy, representing more than two-thirds of demand here—has grown more slowly in recent months and could remain weak for the short term.<br />Next year’s economic outlook is brighter. Congress on Monday passed a roughly $900 billion pandemic-relief package that includes a new round of $600 stimulus checks for most individuals and enhanced unemployment benefits. Authorities this month began giving some essential workers and other vulnerable Americans the vaccine against the virus, the start of a monthslong process that could eventually lead the economy to more fully reopen. Some economists think gross domestic product could grow by a robust 5% or more next year.</td>

      <td>Agribusiness giants, startups jockey to pay farmers for capturing greenhouse gases in fields; environmental groups question impact</td>
      <td>U.S. farmers make their living raising crops from the soil each year. Now, some are getting paid for putting something back into their fields: carbon.<br />Big agriculture companies including  Bayer AG ,  Nutrien Ltd.  and Cargill Inc. are jockeying with startups to encourage crop producers to adopt climate-friendly practices and develop farming-driven carbon markets. Those efforts would let retailers, food makers and other companies offset their greenhouse gas emissions by paying farmers for their fields’ capacity to withdraw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and trap it in the soil.<br />The concept envisions the U.S. Midwest’s swatches of cropland doing double duty as a vast carbon sink. Plants’ process of photosynthesis withdraws carbon dioxide from the air, combines it with water and sunlight to produce energy, and ultimately embeds carbon in dirt through roots, while releasing oxygen back into the atmosphere. Soil, if left undisturbed, can retain the converted carbon for years.<br />Agricultural companies, long criticized as environmental villains, say that paying farmers to maximize those natural processes can put the scale of modern farming behind a potential climate solution. Farmers, following half a decade of lean crop prices, are contemplating a possible new source of income that is less dependent on weather and agricultural commodity markets. The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that the agriculture sector accounts for 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.<br />President-elect Joe Biden’s administration also plans to pursue the concept. Mr. Biden said this month that under his administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will direct federal conservation payments to farmers who use their fields to capture more carbon.</td>

      <td>Apple Inc.  is booting thousands of videogame apps from its platform in China as the government clamps down harder on such content, illustrating the tech giant’s vulnerability to state pressure on its business.<br />The iPhone maker this month warned Chinese developers that a new wave of paid gaming apps are at risk of removal from its app store, according to a memo viewed by The Wall Street Journal, after the company removed thousands of such apps earlier this year.<br />The Chinese government four years ago began requiring videogames to be licensed before being released, but developers were able to skirt the requirement in Apple’s app store. Apple hasn’t said why the loophole existed or why the company began closing it this year. Foreign software developers lament the change, citing difficulty securing approval in China for their games.<br />The app-store purge comes as China has stepped up efforts to police its internet, tightening content controls and censorship, including a demand that Tripadvisor and more than 100 other apps be removed from the Apple store in the country. The Cyberspace Administration of China called the apps illegal without spelling out the offenses Tripadvisor or the other apps, most of which are from Chinese developers, had committed. Tripadvisor declined to comment.<br />The Cyberspace Administration of China, which regulates cybersecurity, and the National Radio and Television Administration, which approves videogames, didn’t respond to requests for comment.</td>

Purdue is trying to resolve those lawsuits through bankruptcy.</td>

In return, the Justice Department agreed to drop an objection it filed in the Westmoreland case alleging McKinsey’s disclosures were legally insufficient.<br />The settlement is the latest in several multimillion-dollar deals in recent years tied to questions about McKinsey’s disclosure practices. Bankruptcy advisers legally are required to be disinterested and to disclose connections that could give rise to a conflict of interest.<br />“It is my hope that McKinsey management is able to implement changes that make a difference,” said Judge David Jones of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, who oversaw the Westmoreland case and related disclosure litigation.</td>

Joe Biden called it a mere “down payment” and Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it is “a first step.” They want bailouts for the states in particular, even as the latest Census report shows states are doing far better than they claim.<br />States are also doing very well in this latest Covid bill. Start with the $26 billion for transit agencies, airports and shovel-ready public works. This will help New York’s transit and port authorities reduce their financial holes.<br />There’s also $22 billion for the states for Covid testing and contact tracing, though insurers and the feds cover the cost of tests. States will use it for more budget backfill. The Los Angeles Times reported last month that 25 LA County firefighters had made more than $100,000 on average in overtime by ferrying test supplies, most of which was reimbursed by federal Cares Act funds.<br />Education will get a whopping $82 billion, about $54 billion of which will go to K-12 schools though many are closed and employ fewer staff. That’s about as much as the federal government spends on K-12 in a normal year. The bill also provides $3.2 billion for broadband for low-income families, so public schools don’t have to pay for that.<br />States will also benefit from the federal enhanced $300 weekly unemployment benefits, which are taxable income in most states.  The jobless benefit sweetener will especially help states with higher unemployment such as New Jersey (10.2%), Hawaii (10.1%), New York (8.4%), Connecticut (8.2%) and California (8.2%).</td>

      <td>How bloody-minded will Democrats be with their precariously thin House majority? We’re about to find out as Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s caucus considers an election challenge from Iowa’s 2nd Congressional district.<br />On Nov. 30, Iowa certified Republican candidate Mariannette Miller-Meeks the winner of the district, which extends southeast of Des Moines and is currently held by a Democrat. The margin was six votes.<br />On Tuesday Democrat Rita Hart submitted a brief asking the House of Representatives to overturn that outcome. Authored by Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias, it says counting 22 mostly absentee ballots would give Ms. Hart a nine-vote lead. The brief asks the House to order another recount and use its constitutional authority to seat Ms. Hart instead.<br />Among the reasons the ballots were wrongly excluded, the brief says, are signature placement, envelope seal and timeliness. Ms. Miller-Meeks’s campaign must file a response, which could raise other ballot disputes, within 30 days. Her campaign said in a statement: “Congresswoman-elect Mariannette Miller-Meeks won the vote on election night, won the 24-county audit and official canvas, won the 24-county recount, and was unanimously certified by the State of Iowa as the winner of the election by a bipartisan council.”<br />One political vulnerability for the Hart campaign is that it did not exhaust its Iowa court challenges before asking the House to intervene. The campaign said there wasn’t time for judicial relief in the one-week window between certification and the Dec. 8 deadline for a five-member state “contest court” ruling. But if only 22 ballots are at issue, the complaint could have been presented to Iowa judges.</td>

      <td>‘I failed, nobody else failed.” You don’t hear that often, or ever, from a government official. But that’s what Operation Warp Speed logistics chief Gen. Gustave Perna said Saturday by way of apologizing to states for shipping fewer  Pfizer  Covid vaccine doses than expected. Kudos to Gen. Perna—and all the more so since overall the vaccine rollout is a historic success.<br />Close collaboration between government and private industry has made a vaccine available in record time and now is proving essential to distribution logistics. The military has been charged with coordinating distribution with states and private companies across a long supply chain including drug makers, airlines, freight companies, pharmacies, hospitals and nursing homes.<br />All of this involves meticulous planning, which has been in the works since early spring. Operation Warp Speed accelerated vaccine development by removing financial risk for drug makers and helping them line up facilities to manufacture vaccine candidates and sites to conduct trials. It has also accelerated and facilitated distribution.<br />Drug makers usually wait until their vaccines are approved before buying raw materials and establishing manufacturing lines and supply chains. Operation Warp Speed worked with and provided funding for drug makers to do all of this months ahead of time. So once vaccines are approved, shipments can begin immediately.<br />Pfizer has done most of the logistical groundwork for its vaccine, which is especially tricky because it must be transported and stored at ultra-cold temperatures. There are multiple steps from manufacturing to inoculation including final-assembly and storage sites. Pfizer has planned dozens of cargo flights and hundreds of truck trips every day.</td>

      <td>A fight over the data fees that trading firms pay stock exchanges has grown tense, and trading firms have been calling for back up. The Securities and Exchange Commission has had mixed success lately in its search for the best ways to lower barriers for traders. But its rule on data infrastructure will expand access to key trading information while remaining within its authority.<br />Finalized this month, the rule mandates that exchanges such as Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange publish more detailed live trading data on their public data feeds. These feeds report last-sale quotations for each listed stock, but they omit other data that allow traders to gauge a stock’s momentum, such as recent offers made above and below the current sale price. Public feeds also lag behind the pace of trading, making it hard for traders who track prices to execute profitably in today’s high-speed market.<br />Trading firms and the SEC say the shoddiness of public data is part of the exchanges’ plan. To access quick, quality stock info, firms must subscribe to any of the increasing number of premium feeds that NYSE, Nasdaq and the  Chicago Board Options Exchange  now offer. The SEC found that, from 2010 to 2018, traders’ data fees increased anywhere from 967% to 2,916% depending on their business model. A typical midsize firm might now pay $3 million annually for its live stock price data, before additional transaction fees.<br />In addition to beefing up the public feeds, the new rule will expand the range of data that exchanges must send to other publishers of stock price info. These “competing consolidators” sell analysis of stock fluctuations to traders, often for lower fees than the exchanges charge for their premium feeds. The SEC will also require exchanges to publish sale prices for smaller lots of certain high-price stocks, providing a more useful guide for traders who deal in small volumes.<br />The new rule comes six months after the SEC took a pair of losses in previous attempts to regulate the exchanges. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in June struck down the agency’s plan to study the market by temporarily adjusting certain exchange fees and rebates. The court also blocked the SEC’s move to roll back exchanges’ fee increases once they’re already in place.</td>

      <td>Cardona will face pressure to abandon charter schools, one of the few government innovations that work.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden has chosen an education secretary who may be open to reforms that enhance student achievement, even at the cost of ruffling feathers in the education bureaucracy. Miguel Cardona, Connecticut’s education commissioner, pressed to get children back in school while teachers unions wanted them closed. Rather than follow the “college or bust” monomania, he has urged equal support for children “who need hands-on experiences, who want to build things, who want to manufacture.”<br />Dacia Toll, CEO of the Achievement First charter-school network that operates in Connecticut, says of Mr. Cardona: “I haven’t found him to be driven by ideology and politics. He is more focused on making sure every kid gets an excellent education than the type of school they go to.”<br />Let’s hope he can maintain that evenhandedness, taste for excellence, and openness to reform. For if Mr. Cardona ends up running the Education Department, he will face heavy pressure to focus less on children and more on what is politically expedient. Advocates surrounding him will demand lots more money for the status quo and an end to disruption of existing K-12 systems.<br />If a Secretary Cardona does choose to resist, he’ll have evidence on his side. People who demand more spending on social programs love to chatter about “evidence based” policy making. Follow the science! goes the familiar cry. Alas, this sloganeering is often lip service.<br />One sad reality about “evidence-based social policy” is that astonishingly few interventions show any proof that they work. Beginning in 2001, some very smart economists and social scientists worked for more than a decade to build the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy. These careful investigators reviewed many hundreds of academic assessments, and commissioned some original ones of their own. In the end, they were able to identify only 12 domestic programs that clearly helped the population they were aimed at. Another 16 programs showed partial signs of effectiveness, and 31 more had outcomes that were somewhat encouraging though indefinite. That was it. After decades of interventions consuming billions of dollars, a grand total of 59 programs could demonstrate any positive effect.</td>

      <td>A policy aimed at conspiracy theories could hit scientific brainstorming.</td>
      <td>Facebook has announced a policy to “remove false claims that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips, or anything else that isn’t on the official vaccine ingredient list.” This seems reasonable, until you think through the details.<br />One difficulty is that banning discussion is a terrible way to counter a conspiracy theory; the censorship is seen as further evidence of a conspiracy. Better to acknowledge the facts and test the theory’s plausibility. Radio-frequency identification chips can be as narrow as 0.15 millimeter, small enough to fit through the 25-gauge needle used for vaccinations. But objects that size can be seen with the naked eye. Thousands of medical personnel have administered the vaccines, and none have reported little black objects floating in the bottles. Further, how could one microchip per person be extracted from a single bottle containing multiple doses? And why would anyone bother to tag people now that we all carry cellphones with unique identifiers?<br />The notion that there are microchips in vaccines is a ridiculous conspiracy theory, best dealt with by facts, science, logic and ridicule, not censorship. But Facebook’s policy of restricting discussion to substances on the “official vaccine ingredient list” also hinders serious discussion of what is causing the rare allergic reactions to the  Pfizer  vaccine.<br />That inquiry has centered on one of the official ingredients, polyethylene glycol, which is very rarely an allergen. We should also consider the possibility of trace amounts of other allergens accompanying the officially listed ingredients. To assess this, I showed the ingredient list to a drug-formulation scientist, Chris Moreton. He responded that some of the lipid ingredients are typically derived from plants such as beans, and traces of proteins from these plants should be considered as potential causes of the allergic reactions. That is a forbidden thought on Facebook because bean protein isn’t on the official vaccine ingredients list.<br />Mr. Moreton and I are scientists, and Facebook’s policies would suppress our brainstorming. There are ways of dealing with such controversies without censorship. In science, we have journals, seminars and conferences in which all sorts of hypotheses are floated and assessed. We have a decentralized process by which good ideas can rise to the top.</td>

      <td>Section 230 has its flaws, but those are nothing compared with what Big Brother would bring.</td>
      <td>If you had told me 24 years ago that the internet pornography law I was working on would be the main obstacle to defense spending in 2020, I would have called you crazy. Yet for the past several weeks President Trump has repeatedly warned that he will veto the $740 billion defense appropriation bill if Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act isn’t repealed.<br />The congressional committee that drafted the 1996 act’s final language knew that Section 230 was a critical law at the dawn of the internet, and we passed it for a specific reason: to protect the internet’s role as a free marketplace of ideas. What went wrong? We succeeded too well.<br />In recent years, Section 230 has become a political punching bag, with some saying it allows big tech companies to censor political views, and others saying it enables the spread of disinformation. Nearly a quarter century ago, we couldn’t have anticipated today’s internet, where one private company,  Facebook ,  controls most of the public forums that Americans use to express their views, and another, Google, controls most of the information Americans receive when they search the internet.<br />We need to re-evaluate Section 230 in light of today’s very different internet. But there’s one thing we shouldn’t re-evaluate: the provision’s role in supporting and nurturing an open and free marketplace of ideas. Every election cycle, and almost every news cycle, reminds us how difficult it is to defend the free-speech rights of those with whom we disagree. Our tradition of free expression is threatened every day, and we must remain vigilant about preserving it.<br />Simply repealing Section 230 is the worst possible solution. If website owners are held liable for everything that appears on their platforms, they will have to create systems for reviewing and editing all posted content before it goes up. This is an impossible task. At best it would create an environment that allows only the most limited and inoffensive speech. At worst it would force operators to shut down many social-media sites and drastically limit the ability of private citizens to express views online. We would end up with a Kafkaesque process governed by tort lawyers, political correctness and hidden agendas. This isn’t the right solution for a free society.</td>
