      <td>Daniel Ortega tightens his grip ahead of November elections, as rivals are arrested; ‘we are worried, nervous and afraid’</td>
      <td>Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, 75, who is running for a fourth consecutive term, has launched a broad campaign of repression since early June aimed at decimating the opposition ahead of November elections, according to analysts, human-rights activists and Western governments.<br />In recent days, police beat one opposition presidential hopeful before putting him in prison. Another would-be opposition candidate was arrested shortly after he filmed a video saying goodbye to his family in case he, too, was detained. A third prominent opposition leader was photographed by police after they stormed his home to arrest him. In the picture, he looked frightened as he stood next to a police commander accused by the U.S. of human-rights violations.<br />The wave of arrests, seen by analysts as among the worst crackdowns against civil society in Latin America in decades, presents another problem for the Biden administration as it struggles to deal with a region mired in grinding poverty and endemic corruption that is sending hundreds of thousands of migrants to the U.S. and threatening the new administration’s agenda.<br />The wave of arrests came as top U.S. officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, visited Central America last week to promote good governance and find ways to slow illegal immigration to the U.S.<br />At least 13 prominent Nicaraguan members of the opposition, including four possible presidential contenders, have been arrested in the past two weeks. The potential candidates had all been jockeying to be nominated on behalf of the opposition, a loose coalition of parties and civic groups.</td>

      <td>On Friday this column noted the predictable result that after lawmakers and central bankers initiated a multitrillion-dollar flood of Covid-related cash, various observers are advancing massive estimates of the amount of money ending up in criminal hands. But it’s important to note that the problem with government wealth redistributions is not just that huge sums stick to undeserving fingers. Such programs can also fail to offer timely assistance to the very people they are intended to help.<br />Take the example of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who has been bragging since last year about his success in engineering bailouts for the operators of entertainment venues. Yet somehow this taxpayer money doesn’t seem to be reaching many of the people Mr. Schumer intended to subsidize. Ben Sisario, Stacy Cowley and Julia Jacobs recently reported in the New York Times:<br />Last year Mr. Schumer warned that 90% of independent venues might die without emergency funding. Now, according to the Times, the government doesn’t believe that a number of the venue operators are alive:<br />Is it time to kill a federal program that can’t seem to provide help to the living?<br />***</td>

      <td><br /><br /><br />Chicago-raised rapper Polo G made his first chart impact in 2019 with his single “Pop Out,” which hit No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and appeared on his top 10 debut album, “Die a Legend.” His continuing ascent since then has been steady and incremental. In interviews, he articulates a methodical approach to his career, always looking an album or two ahead. While talking with the online magazine Complex about the possibility of working with acclaimed rappers like J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar, the 22-year-old, born Taurus Bartlett, said he wants “to get a little bit better lyrically in that style before I would jump on that type of song.” This intense focus, building on his strengths while identifying and improving upon shortcomings, led to a strong sophomore effort—2020’s “The Goat”—and now “Hall of Fame” (Columbia), his excellent third LP.<br />Polo G’s music is haunted by loss, and there’s a pervasive sadness to his voice. Anxiety and melancholy are draped over his music like a weighted blanket. Even when he’s rapping about having escaped the struggles of his childhood and making lots of money, he sounds wistful rather than celebratory, as if aware of how quickly things could change. In the world of his music, nothing is promised and you can never rest on past accomplishments. Something is always coming for you, even if it’s your dark visions that plague your mind.</td>

      <td>The risks to its credibility and independence are growing.</td>
      <td>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) convenes this week for a regular meeting that carries more than the usual stakes. Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues need to decide soon whether to defend the Federal Reserve’s credibility and independence. Otherwise they may find they’ve missed their opportunity.<br />The obvious although not the only credibility challenge is inflation. Consumer-price increases hit 5% year-on-year in May, and 3.8% excluding food and fuel. This followed inflation of 4.2% in April and significant increases to producer prices throughout the spring.<br />Some of this is due to so-called base effects, the comparison to the pandemic-deflated prices of a year ago. Some of it arises from supply-chain bottlenecks and the release of pent-up demand that will dissipate. The Fed also points to falling yields on the 10-year Treasury as a sign that markets don’t fear inflation.<br />But there are still risks to a sanguine approach to current price movements. Inflation may prove less transitory than hoped if the Biden Administration’s spending plans goose demand while its tax and regulatory policies constrict supply. The Fed’s unspoken weak-dollar policy will exacerbate import-price inflation. Even transitory inflation will leave Americans permanently worse off than they otherwise would be.<br />Inflation already is outpacing wage growth, despite America’s labor shortage as enhanced unemployment benefits lure workers to the sidelines. Inflation-adjusted wages fell slightly in May for the second month. The Fed seems to believe the solution is to keep Mr. Powell’s foot on the gas to boost employment further. But job vacancies are at an unprecedented high as employers compete for workers. If this isn’t spurring wage growth faster than inflation, the Fed should ask why not?</td>

Apple Inc.  told committee officials last month that the Justice Department had served grand- jury subpoenas on the tech giant in February 2018, when Mr. Trump had complained about leaks related to contacts between Russia and figures in his 2016 election campaign and then-special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into those ties.<br />Senate Democrats have called for Mr. Trump’s attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and William Barr, to testify under oath about the subpoenas, and the Justice Department’s inspector general launched a review at Mr. Garland’s request into whether the requests were improper.<br />“There are important questions that must be resolved in connection with an effort by the department to obtain records related to members of Congress and congressional staff,” Mr. Garland said. “Consistent with our commitment to the rule of law, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separation-of-powers concerns moving forward.”</td>

The division has a leading role in drafting a planned rule proposal that would require public companies to reveal more about the risks and impacts of climate change on their business.<br />Ms. Jones, 56 years old, has written critically about large, private companies known as unicorns, which are valued at over $1 billion before going public. The SEC has over the past decade made it easier for private companies to raise capital, which largely exempts them from the agency’s oversight.<br />She will succeed the division’s acting director, John Coates, also 56, who will take over as the agency’s general counsel, the SEC said in a news release. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Ms. Jones has taught classes on securities regulation, corporate governance and financial regulation.<br />Ms. Jones wrote in a law review article in 2010 that while the financial crisis had damaged the SEC’s credibility, the regulator was likely to emerge “as a stronger and more capable regulator.”</td>

      <td>Justices hold that 2018 law provides no relief to offenders whose crimes don’t carry mandatory minimum sentences</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court limited the scope of a 2018 law aimed at reducing sentencing disparities for drug offenses, ruling unanimously on Monday that it provides no relief to offenders convicted of crimes that don’t carry mandatory minimum sentences.<br />The First Step Act, passed under the Trump administration with rare bipartisan support, extended an Obama-era initiative to reduce the disparity in punishment for crack-cocaine offenses, which popularly had been associated with Black communities, compared with that for powder-cocaine crimes more often committed by white offenders.<br />The measure made retroactive sentencing reductions that Congress had approved in the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act. That law lifted the thresholds triggering mandatory minimum sentences for possessing specific quantities of crack, raising to 28 grams from 5 the amount for 5 years, and to 280 grams from 50 for a 10-year minimum.<br />The First Step Act states that it provides relief to individuals convicted before 2010 of “a violation of a Federal criminal statute, the statutory penalties for which were modified” by the Fair Sentencing Act.<br />But Tarahrick Terry, arrested in Miami in 2008 with 3.9 grams of crack, was sentenced for possession with intent to distribute narcotics, a provision that carried no mandatory minimum. As such, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court, Mr. Terry could obtain no relief from the First Step Act.</td>

      <td>Payments will go to about 39 million households</td>
      <td>The child tax credit is a federal benefit that reduces income tax liability for people with children. It was created in 1997 and since then has expanded several times. It is a credit that reduces taxes owed as opposed to a deduction that reduces taxable income. The temporary changes in effect for 2021 make it a near-universal monthly child allowance, far from the annual tax break it started as. The changes came about as part of the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus bill passed in March<br />Here is how it works.<br />Until 2021, the credit was $2,000 per child under age 17, based on the child’s age at the end of the year. For 2021 only, Congress increased the credit to $3,000 for children ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 for children under age 6.<br />On the low end, there were limits, but they have been removed for this year. Until 2021, low-income households that didn’t owe income taxes could get up to $1,400 of the $2,000 credit. This year, they can get the full credit even if they have no income.<br />On the high end, some limits are still in place. The expanded portion of the credit starts phasing out once income reaches $75,000 for individuals, $112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for married couples. The base $2,000 credit for higher-income households remains, and that phases out once income reaches $200,000 for individuals and $400,000 for married couples.</td>

      <td>Royal Philips NV has recalled millions of sleep apnea and ventilator machines over concerns that a type of foam used in the devices could degrade and release harmful, possibly cancer-causing, particles.<br />The recall affects three million to four million machines, more than half of which are in the U.S., a company spokesman said Monday. About 80% are machines for aiding people with sleep apnea, a condition that causes a person to stop breathing for short periods during sleep. The rest are life-supporting mechanical ventilators.<br />Philips said after receiving a small number of patient complaints it was concerned that a type of foam used to dampen the machines’ sound may degrade into particles that are swallowed or inhaled by the user. These particles could cause headaches or breathing problems and might be carcinogenic, the company said, adding that gases released by the foam could also be harmful.<br />Philips said it had received no reports of death as a result of these issues.<br />The Amsterdam-based company said patients using the sleep apnea devices, known as BiPaP and CPAP, should stop treatment and seek an alternative if possible. Those on life-supporting ventilation should in general continue to use the device, as harm from withdrawal could outweigh the risks of the foam particles, it said.</td>

      <td>Menopause’s effects on the brain are often temporary, according to a new study. But there’s a caution for women at risk of Alzheimer’s.</td>
      <td>Menopause changes women’s brains—but many of the changes are temporary, and the brain eventually compensates for some of them, according to new research.<br />In one of the first studies to take an in-depth look at brain changes in healthy women before and after menopause, researchers from Weill Cornell and the University of Arizona found that the menopause transition changes the brain’s structure, energy consumption and connectivity. The volume of the brain’s gray matter—which consists of nerve cells—decreases, as does its white matter, which contains the fibers that connect nerve cells. Brain regions associated with memory and perception also showed declining glucose levels, the study found.<br />But the findings contained some good news: Women’s brains at least partly compensate for these declines with increased blood flow and production of a molecule called ATP, the main energy source for cells.<br />“Our study suggests that the brain has the ability to find a new normal after menopause in most women,” said Lisa Mosconi, lead author of the study and an associate professor of neurology and director of the Women’s Brain Initiative at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York. The study was published last week in the journal Scientific Reports.<br />There was a caution for one group of women, though. Women in the study who had a genetic variant associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease accumulated more plaques of a protein called amyloid beta during perimenopause than women and men without the genetic variant. These plaques are linked to possible later development of Alzheimer’s.</td>

The market value of all bitcoin in circulation climbed to $752.23 billion, according to CoinDesk.<br />MicroStrategy said in a securities filing Monday it raised $488 million from its bond sale, an increase from the $400 million it initially planned. The funds will be used to purchase additional bitcoin. The company has been a longtime investor in the cryptocurrency, and this was its third bond sale to purchase bitcoins in less than a year.<br />“That [MicroStrategy offering] is going to be a massive upward price catalyst because $488 million is a lot of inflow,” said Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at London-based asset management firm  CoinShares .  “Traders are going to position themselves around that event because they know there is going to be volatility.”<br />Despite recent volatility, Ms. Demirors said she expects longtime investors in bitcoin to hold on to their positions for the long term. Trading in bitcoin has been relatively rangebound in recent weeks. She expects that could continue and that, by fall, bitcoin could possibly return to record highs of more than $60,000 apiece.

As the trial unfolded last week in federal court here, testimony showed university employees fumbling with unclear disclosure policies and struggling to explain to Mr. Hu the required paperwork and what constituted a conflict of interest.<br />Mr. Hu, who specializes in nanotechnology, is charged with wire fraud and lying to the government about his work in China when he sought and received two grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.<br />A 52-year-old China-born naturalized Canadian, Mr. Hu took the stand on Friday to testify in his own defense. He told the court that he didn’t deliberately try to hide his China work, answered all questions he was asked about it and was confused about what the university actually wanted him to report.<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation began an effort around three years ago to root out U.S.-based researchers receiving government grants who it saw as possibly transferring cutting-edge know-how to China, wittingly or otherwise.

He didn’t address the new charges against him, and his next court date is set for June 21. Mr. Veltman told the judge he has yet to retain a lawyer. He hasn’t addressed the first-degree-murder and attempted-murder charges that he faces.<br />Evidence submitted at hearings related to Mr. Veltman’s charges is subject to a publication ban.</td>

      <td>Four-week holdup will allow time to assess whether rising caseloads will translate into higher hospitalizations and deaths</td>
      <td>LONDON—U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson delayed a long-awaited end to Covid-19 restrictions in England following an upswing in cases of a more contagious variant of coronavirus, highlighting how the virus can spread even within highly vaccinated populations.<br />The four-week delay offers a cautionary lesson to the U.S. and other countries about the risk of further outbreaks caused by new forms of the virus that are spreading around the world. The variant is primarily spreading among younger, unvaccinated groups in Britain but cases have been detected among older people who have had one and sometimes two doses of vaccine.<br />The delay will allow the government to administer more shots and give public-health officials extra time to assess if vaccines are doing the job of preventing rising caseloads from resulting in packed hospitals and more deaths.<br />“Now is the time to ease off the accelerator,” Mr. Johnson said at a news conference. “By being cautious now, we have the chance in the next four weeks to save many thousands of lives by vaccinating millions of people.”<br />The emerging evidence from the U.K. suggests that the variant known as Delta, which was first detected during a huge wave of infection in India earlier this year, is considerably more transmissible than older strains of the virus and that infection is more likely to result in hospitalization.</td>

      <td>Neither the original source of the virus nor the intermediary animal has been traced to confirm the zoonotic spread.</td>
      <td>Regarding Steven Quay and Richard Muller’s “The Science Suggests a Wuhan Lab Leak” (op-ed, June 7): It has been 18 months since the pandemic broke out. Neither the original source of the virus nor the intermediary animal has been traced to confirm the zoonotic spread. For all these months, the Chinese have had the means to find out. In the absence of confirmation of a proof favoring the natural-origin theory, the lab-leak theory is gaining traction. The presence of the double CGG sequence is definitely building scientific circumstantial evidence for the lab-leak theory. The Chinese government will certainly do everything in its power to cover up. A document or a whistleblower might emerge sooner or later, if the world really seeks this.<br />Venkat Naidu<br />Sugar Land, Texas<br /><br />Current exculpation efforts by the major media figures is absurd. Their claim that the reason for the Wuhan lab as the source for Covid-19 theory being dismissed was because it came from President Trump and Secretary Mike Pompeo, hence was “not serious.” It also came from more serious sources such as Tasuku Honjo (Nobel 2018), who asserted it came from China, and Luc Montagnier (Nobel 2008), who said it had to be from a lab, not from nature, and that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the most likely source. An Indian study also said that it had to be manufactured. The press wouldn’t accept anything that the Trump administration said for political reasons. Vice President Kamala Harris announced a while ago that she would not be vaccinated “if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it.” But she did get vaccinated, as did half the nation, and it was president Trump’s vaccine.</td>

The latter groups have member politicians who express disdain for religion and the nuclear family, and think people should receive monthly checks on the taxpayer’s dime whether they choose to work or not.<br />But there is another motive that is quietly driving Hispanic voters toward the right: history. The Spanish were in the Americas long before the English, and their interactions with native peoples in North, Central and South America were often brutal in their quest for power and riches. They committed many atrocities. In other words, they share many of the same “sins” as most other powerful and coming civilizations that mirror many of the misdeeds the U.S. has historically recognized, including our treatment of Native Americans and enslavement of black Africans. Nevertheless, Latinos quietly understand that world history has often been brutal and messy, yet we must recognize misdeeds and aspire toward “the better angels of our nature” if we are to build a better America.

      <td>College students aren’t guinea pigs.</td>
      <td>Some 450 U.S. colleges and universities—including our institutions—have announced policies mandating that all students be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 before the fall semester, with some requiring vaccination now for the summer term. Schools have for decades required vaccination against infectious diseases, but these mandates are unprecedented—and unethical. Never before have colleges insisted that students or employees receive an experimental vaccine as a condition of attendance or employment.<br />Even soldiers, whose rights are constrained when they join the service, aren’t being compelled to take a Covid vaccine. In a case involving a vaccine against anthrax, a federal district judge held in 2004 that “the United States cannot demand that members of the armed forces also serve as guinea pigs for experimental drugs” absent informed consent or a presidential waiver of service members’ legal protections. The following year the judge held that an emergency-use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration was insufficient to meet the legal test.<br />The FDA has issued such authorizations for three Covid vaccines, but it hasn’t fully approved any of them. Students at Notre Dame (for example) resume classes on Aug. 23, and freshmen arrive on campus Aug. 18. The Pfizer vaccine—first in line for approval—requires three weeks before the booster shot, so it would have to be approved by July 28 for students to meet the school’s deadline without making themselves experimental subjects. Pfizer applied to the FDA May 7 for “priority review,” a process that usually takes six months.<br />Universities might counter that—as with elementary schools requiring pediatric vaccinations—immunization is for students’ own good. But children can be at significant medical risks from the illnesses that we vaccinate them against, particularly when community vaccination rates are low. Not so with Covid. For those under 30, the risks of serious morbidity and mortality are close to zero. By contrast, early indications from passive surveillance systems (which call for follow-up investigation) and a June 10 review by the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee indicated an excess risk for heart inflammation, especially in men 30 and younger.<br />Colleges’ vaccine mandates also ignore the huge number of students—thousands of them at Notre Dame—who have already recovered from Covid infection, and who thus possess natural immunity, which studies have suggested is more robust and durable than vaccine immunity. While vaccinating Covid-recovered patients might produce an antibody uptick, there is no epidemiological evidence that this improves relevant clinical outcomes like reinfection or transmissibility. Previous infection can easily be verified with the university’s own records of testing throughout the past school year, a positive viral test from another provider or an antibody test, which would prove either natural immunity or vaccination.</td>

      <td>Electric-vehicle startups that follow Tesla down the luxury route could have better chances of success</td>
      <td>Lordstown Motors  likely won’t be the only electric vehicle company to veer off the road before it has even started selling its key product. The startups that stand the best chance of meeting high investor expectations may be those focused on luxury, not utility.<br />The would-be truck maker, which went public via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company last October, said Monday that Steve Burns, previously described as its founder, chairman and chief executive officer, was stepping down. So too is Chief Financial Officer Julio Rodriguez. This follows a rocky few months in which the company has warned of higher costs, insufficient capital and inaccurate disclosures as it tries to rush out an all-electric pickup truck this fall, ahead of the Detroit giants. Its shares fell 19% in morning trading to $9.40, below the SPAC’s $10 launch price.<br />Lordstown Motors is trying to breathe new life into a car factory abandoned by  General Motors  in Lordstown, Ohio, by getting to market early with the kind of utility vehicles that are typically bought by cost-focused fleet businesses. This is a promising road for EVs, which are still more expensive than comparable traditional vehicles upfront but come with the promise of lower running costs.<br />But the company’s challenges underline why competing on cost is hard for a startup to do, particularly amid rapid inflation in raw-material prices. The company was planning to source the frames for its truck, the Endurance, from a supplier. Then its potential partners either pulled back or raised their prices. Its response was to bring frame production in house, but that implies a jump in capital spending and the vehicle’s cost profile.<br />Meanwhile,  Ford ,  which currently dominates the fleet business, has brought forward the launch date for an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck to next spring. Amid plenty of noise about not giving up market leadership, it said in May the new F-150 “Lightning” would start at around $40,000, which compares with $52,500 for Lordstown’s Endurance. This month, Ford unveiled an entry-level hybrid truck starting at under $20,000, the Maverick.</td>

      <td>Cars remain in service longer as quality improves, prices rise</td>

While the average vehicle age has risen steadily over the last 15 years, the trend accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic partly because of a drop in new-car sales, IHS said.<br />The finding reflects the stronger value of vehicles throughout their life cycles, from higher new-vehicle prices Americans have been paying for years to steeper prices on the used-car lot, said Todd Campau, associate director of aftermarket solutions at IHS. Improved vehicle quality also is a factor, he said.<br />Whereas 20 years ago a car might have changed hands once or twice and lasted 100,000 miles, it is more common today for a car to have multiple owners and last for 200,000 miles or more, he said.<br />“That has extended the life cycle of the vehicle and created value for more buyers up and down the chain,” Mr. Campau. “For that second or third or fourth owner, there’s still meat on the bone.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court asked the Biden administration to weigh in on a legal challenge to Harvard University’s race-conscious undergraduate admissions policies.<br />The justices, in a brief written order on Monday, asked the U.S. Solicitor General’s office to submit the federal government’s views on an appeal that argued Harvard unlawfully discriminated against Asian-American applicants.<br />The move effectively delays for months any decision by the high court on whether it will hear the case. It also gives the Biden administration a chance to distance itself from arguments made by the Trump-era Justice Department, which supported the lawsuit against Harvard and more broadly challenged the consideration of race in college admissions.<br />The Harvard case dates back to 2014, when a group called Students for Fair Admissions, led by conservative legal activist Edward Blum, filed a lawsuit alleging the school’s undergraduate admissions practices violated federal civil-rights law. The group said Harvard held Asian-American applicants to a higher standard and used racial balancing, similar to a quota system, artificially limiting the number of Asian-American applicants it admitted.<br />The challengers are urging the Supreme Court to overturn decades of precedent and ban race as a factor in college admissions. Current law permits schools to consider an applicant’s race, but not use it as a determinative factor. In a 1978 case, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the controlling opinion by Justice Lewis Powell, specifically cited the Harvard admissions process to exemplify the permissible use of race as a plus factor in assembling an undergraduate class.</td>

Three years from now, survey respondents said they expected to see inflation at 3.6%, the second highest reading for the survey, up from April’s 3.1%.<br />The jump in inflation expectations came as respondents to the survey project major increases in home prices and for other things critical to daily life. One year from now, food and rent prices are expected to rise by 8% and 9.7%, respectively, both carving out series highs. Meanwhile, the expected rise in gasoline and medical care costs also increased, with both readings just short of 10%.<br />Home prices are expected to rise by 6.2% a year from now, a series high, and up from April’s 5.5% reading, the survey said.<br />The New York Fed expected inflation readings arrived just as the Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold over Tuesday and Wednesday a pivotal meeting on monetary policy.

The New York Islanders learned this the hard way.<br />The Islanders won four Stanley Cups in a row in the 1980s and nurtured a passionate fan base at their longtime home in Long Island at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. But the team outgrew its small, aging barn and relocated in 2015 to the  Barclays  Center—only to find the glitzy arena was deeply ill-suited for hockey.<br />The team set out to build its own $1.2 billion building, the UBS Arena, in the parking lot of the Belmont Park horse-racing track here. The venue promises to end the Islanders’ six-year odyssey to find a suitable home, though it won’t be ready to occupy until next year.<br />So for now, the team has returned to the Nassau Coliseum for what is proving to be a memorable victory lap. The Islanders have made it to the Stanley Cup semifinals for the second year in a row, showing that a rebuild under a new management team is peaking at the right time.<br />The Islanders are up one game over the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Stanley Cup Semifinal, having defeated the defending champions 2-1 on the road on Sunday.

Democrat Jay Rockefeller was re-elected to his Senate seat with a stunning 77% of the vote. Democrats won all three of the state’s House seats.<br />Fast forward to 2020 and the results showed a 180-degree turn. Republican Donald Trump won West Virginia in the presidential race by almost 40 percentage points. Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito won her re-election by an even wider margin. Republicans carried all three of the state’s House seats.<br />All that represents the culmination of what veteran Democratic pollster Peter Hart calls the fastest and most thorough move by a single state from one side of the political divide to the other in recent history. “The migration underscored the cultural and economic transformation of America,” Mr. Hart says.<br />The shift from blue to red also explains the position of Joe Manchin, the state’s Democratic senator, who has become the bane of his party’s progressive base for his refusal to go along with their plans to end the Senate’s filibuster and push through a voting-rights bill without Republican votes. “The truth, I would argue, is that voting and election reform that is done in a partisan manner will all but ensure partisan divisions continue to deepen,” he wrote in a home-state newspaper column explaining his stand.<br />Yet there is nothing particularly surprising about Mr. Manchin’s position. His insistence on bipartisanship, which strikes some as both naive and anachronistic, isn’t merely part of his political makeup; it’s what is required for a Democrat holding on in West Virginia.</td>

      <td>State plans lift all remaining rules when 80% milestone is reached</td>
      <td>FAIRFAX, Vt.—Last week a group of older people who attend Rev. Elizabeth Griffin’s strength training class in a former church did something that felt radical. They had class without their masks.<br />Since the entire group was vaccinated, they could leave the masks home under new town rules.<br />“It’s hard to believe some people are still resistant to the vaccine,” said Colleen Steen, dressed in a pink workout top and celebrating her 75th birthday with hand-held weights and some deep knee bends.<br />As the most vaccinated state in America, Vermont says that nearly 80% of the state’s eligible population has received at least one shot of the vaccine. The state has eased most Covid-19 restrictions, and the few that remain apply to unvaccinated individuals. Officials are expected to lift all remaining rules in the coming days when Vermont reaches that 80% milestone. Cases, as measured by a seven-day average daily case count, have dropped 94% since April 1. Hospitalizations have dropped in half in two weeks, and just one patient has died of Covid-19 in the past three weeks. Hospitals are closing their Covid-19 wards, schools are hosting in-person graduation ceremonies and the tourism industry is experiencing a resurgence.<br />“When we reach the 80% level, that essentially tells Vermonters their life is really going to be much closer to what they considered normal in pre-pandemic,” said Mark Levine, the state’s health commissioner.</td>

In contrast to the quick outreach to Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden waited almost a month after taking office to call the embattled former prime minister.<br />Mr. Biden is looking to chart a course with Israel’s new government, which is taking control at a time of intense political strife in Israel and amid growing pressure on the U.S. president from progressive Democrats to challenge Israel over the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and what they see as discriminatory policies against Arab Israelis.<br />Mr. Biden’s four-decade friendship with Mr. Netanyahu was seen as key to his ability to help negotiate a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas last month, following 11 days of deadly fighting.</td>

Turkey’s increasingly discordant role in the alliance also hangs over the gathering.<br />U.S. officials said Mr. Biden will emphasize his commitment to the principle of collective defense enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty that established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949, following some uncertainty about Washington’s view of the matter under former President Donald Trump.<br />“Article Five we take as a sacred obligation,” Mr. Biden said Monday during a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. “I want NATO to know America is there,” he said.<br />During the meeting, NATO’s 30 member countries will take initial steps to revise the group’s Strategic Concept, which sets out the group’s goals. The Strategic Concept will be adopted next year, and is expected to touch on Russia, China, cybersecurity and climate change, according to U.S. officials.</td>

But the near-universal belief that they help has prompted a radical move ahead of the U.S. Olympic Track & Field trials that start June 18 in Eugene, Ore.:<br />Brands that pay elite athletes to endorse their shoes are granting them permission to wear a competitor’s product. For many runners, that’s Nike.<br />Reebok and Brooks have said they’ll allow their athletes to wear another brand at the trials. The running brand On, which recently developed its first-ever track spike, has left open the possibility of its runners doing so as well. Two other brands, Mizuno and Skechers, didn’t answer emailed questions from The Wall Street Journal.<br />“While we believe in the performance of our running product, we also acknowledge the recent advances in footwear technology at the elite level,” a Reebok spokesman said in a statement. He added that until the brand’s new competition shoes are available, Reebok-sponsored athletes “will compete in any World Athletics approved footwear that provides an even playing field with their competition on race day.”</td>

There will no doubt be more warm words of trans-Atlantic harmony on subjects such as Covid-19, climate change and the importance of democracy.<br />Under the surface, points of disagreement remain. On longstanding issues such as European military spending, digital taxes, steel tariffs and subsidies for  Boeing  and  Airbus ,  diplomacy can probably bring progress. Where it will struggle to make meaningful headway is in reconciling different attitudes to China.<br />The weekend’s G-7 communiqué was mainly hawkish on China, but the accompanying commentary highlighted the balancing act the EU has to pull off. European leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s Mario Draghi stressed the need to cooperate with Beijing.<br />Attitudes in Brussels toward the Asian nation have hardened, just as they have in Washington. In 2019, the EU took a big step and labeled China a “systemic rival.” It has since established powers to screen foreign investments and proposed new rules to block takeovers by government-subsidized companies. Central and Eastern European nations have also cooled on Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative.</td>

      <td>Companies are stepping up the pressure on workers to get vaccinated—not necessarily with mandates but with strong nudges.<br />For months, many employers have attempted to coax workers into receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. Companies dangled cash, time off and other prizes to encourage vaccinations. Executives made personal appeals in town-hall meetings and internal memos.<br />Now, some of those efforts are taking a more assertive and urgent tone. While most employers haven’t flat-out ordered staff to get vaccinated, many are asking workers to report their vaccination status or are implementing policies that restrict the activities of unvaccinated workers.<br />Unlike the first wave of corporate efforts—which focused more on getting front-line workers and essential staffers at retailers, hospitals and airlines vaccinated—the latest push affects more professionals at banks, law firms and similar businesses. Some companies say they want reassurance that the majority of their workers are vaccinated before broadly reopening offices.<br />Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  last week ordered its U.S. employees to disclose in an internal portal whether they had received the vaccine. The Wall Street firm, which hasn’t mandated vaccines, has told staff that fully vaccinated employees who have registered their status can work without masks in its offices. Others will still have to wear masks at all times except at their desks. Other banks, including  Morgan Stanley  and  Wells Fargo  & Co., have asked employees to voluntarily register their vaccination status.</td>

      <td>SINGAPORE—The trial of Aung San Suu Kyi, whose government was ousted in a military coup in Myanmar, began Monday on a series of criminal charges that could, if she is convicted, prevent her from returning to public life.<br />Ms. Suu Kyi, 75 years old, has been a defining figure in her country’s struggle for democracy for more than three decades. She won international recognition as an activist fighting military rule and in 2016 became Myanmar’s de facto civilian leader during its transition to partial democracy. The generals reversed that shift by ousting her from power on Feb. 1 and putting the commander-in-chief of the armed forces in absolute control. Ms. Suu Kyi has been detained ever since.<br />Authorities have charged Ms. Suu Kyi with seven criminal offenses, all of which her lawyers say are politically motivated. She faces two charges related to illegally imported walkie-talkies, two charges of violating pandemic-related rules, and one charge each of mishandling state secrets, intent to incite unrest and corruption. If convicted of any or all of the charges, Ms. Suu Kyi could face anywhere from one to more than 20 years in detention, said Khin Maung Zaw, one of her lawyers.<br />A closed-door trial began in three cases on Monday, with two others cases scheduled to be heard Tuesday, he said. The case relating to state secrets will be heard separately, and the corruption charge, which was brought last week, hasn’t yet been brought to the courts, the lawyer said. All cases except the one alleging corruption are expected to be decided by mid-August, he said.<br />“With the pile of charges heaped on her, it certainly appears as if her political life has been smothered,” said David Mathieson, an independent expert on Myanmar based in Thailand. “The collage of disparate charges is a witch-hunt to justify a coup d’etat.”</td>

      <td>While the price of older used jets has stabilized, modern wide-body models keep getting cheaper. This may force plane makers to discount more aggressively.</td>
      <td>It is hard to compete against your own products.<br />Vaccination campaigns are finally giving airlines the visibility they need to buy jets again. This is of particular relief to  Boeing ,  which back in July had about 100 of its 737 MAX planes in storage without an owner. Now the number is only about 10, thanks to a wave of orders from major carriers like United Airlines and Alaska Airlines.<br />It confirms one of the cornerstones of aviation economics: There are always buyers of new, more efficient aircraft. With fuel accounting for a third of airlines’ operating expenses, the cost of the latest jets is small compared with the savings they provide.<br />The question is at what price. Carriers’ haste to purchase the MAX suggests that Boeing is offering generous discounts. Irish low-cost carrier  Ryanair ,  which is known for scooping up cheap planes at moments of crisis, ordered 75 units last December.<br />The MAX’s tarnished reputation gives Boeing a particular reason to prioritize sales over margins. But a broader factor also is at play, including for European manufacturer  Airbus : It is extremely cheap to buy their planes—particularly bigger models—in the secondhand market.</td>

Stripe, in particular, has garnered interest because it has been turbocharged by the coronavirus-fueled boom in online shopping.

An overhaul of the agricultural sector sparked monthslong protests by farmers.<br />But, as a devastating wave of Covid-19 recedes in India, the simmering anger over the government’s handling of the crisis may pose the greatest test for the leader yet.<br />India’s coronavirus crisis—which hit global daily highs in April and May—has left millions infected and more than 360,000 dead. Overwhelmed hospitals throughout the country were forced to turn away patients after running out of beds and medical supplies. The crisis left few people in this country of more than 1.3 billion untouched, and many know severely ill people who struggled to get medical care.<br />Many—even some staunch supporters of Mr. Modi—blame the government for not being better prepared and for allowing mass religious and political gatherings as infections soared in the spring.<br />Until recently, a portrait of the prime minister hung in Varun Goel’s office, and his computer background depicted the bespectacled politician holding a lotus, the symbol of Mr. Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.</td>

Today Boxed delivers groceries and other bulky items such as toilet paper and office supplies from fulfillment centers to consumers and businesses across the country.<br />Many people have become used to shopping online for groceries over the past year. Mr. Huang said he expects shoppers to continue trying new products and a wider range of services via delivery.</td>

The drop in fossil-fuel spending is becoming so severe that energy companies could struggle to quench the world’s thirst for oil, some analysts say.<br />Crude is still expected to remain in high demand over the next decade to make transportation fuels and petrochemicals used for plastics and other household products. U.S. consumption has surged lately following the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, and output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have given prices a further boost.<br />U.S. crude hit $71.48 a barrel Monday, its highest level in more than 2½ years, and has roughly doubled since the end of October. Some traders are using options, which allow the holder to buy or sell an asset at a specific price in the future, to wager on prices hitting $100 by the end of next year.<br />Even after OPEC and its allies lift output in the months ahead, some analysts think production will struggle to catch up to demand, which the International Energy Agency projects will rise at least through 2026. Spending on oil extraction fell last year to about $330 billion, less than half the total from its 2014 record, according to research firm Wood Mackenzie. That figure is expected to rise just modestly this year and in the years ahead.</td>

Officials are set to release updated projections Wednesday after a two-day policy meeting.<br />Fed officials in March saw consumer prices rising 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021 from a year earlier. That pace, they said, would be consistent with their goal of 2% average annual inflation over the long run.<br />Inflation has soared since then, as the economy has rebounded much faster than expected, businesses have struggled to hire workers, and shortages of key materials have wreaked havoc on supply chains.<br />The Labor Department’s consumer-price index jumped 5% in May from a year earlier, following a 4.2% increase in the 12 months through April.</td>

      <td>Sarah Vanunu started a new job three weeks ago at MyHeritage, an online genealogy platform based in Or Yehuda, Israel, and thanks to Israel’s speedy vaccine rollout, she has been eligible for in-person work since she began. But she only goes in on Mondays and Wednesdays and leaves nothing on her assigned desk in between, since different people work there the other days of the week.<br />“It’s so funny to start a new job and not meet everyone up front,” she says. “I still don’t know half of my colleagues.”<br />MyHeritage, which employs about 400 people in Israel, is still operating at reduced capacity due to Covid restrictions. Ms. Vanunu, who directs the company’s public relations, comes to work with just a laptop and mouse. There’s a completely clean desk waiting for her there, with nothing on it but a monitor. If she wants to come in any other days, she must make a reservation online and get assigned to a random desk elsewhere.<br />As millions of workers head back to the office this summer, many will return without a desk of their own. Some appreciate the flexibility of these hot-desk arrangements, which aren’t completely new but have become vastly more popular as part of post-pandemic plans for hybrid work.<br />But hot desks also mean extra time spent managing reservations, coordinating with teams and helping employees feel a sense of belonging without a dedicated spot for them in the office. Experts and workers say there are ways to optimize these spaces, including assigning desks to groups instead of individuals, planning schedules, designating areas for socializing and being extra-mindful of workers with special needs or disabilities.</td>

      <td>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been weighed down for months by investigations into his alleged misconduct, leaving him largely removed from the fast-paced deal-making that typically marks the end of the state Legislature’s annual session.<br />But he notched a key win in the session’s final days last week when the state Senate confirmed his picks to fill two vacancies on the state’s highest court—both of whom would sit as jurors in a possible impeachment trial.<br />Mr. Cuomo is the subject of New York’s first impeachment investigation in more than a century. Democrats who dominate the state Assembly began an inquiry three months ago to look at accusations that the governor sexually harassed current and former aides and to examine his administration’s Covid-19 policies in nursing homes, the production of his memoir and how he granted priority access to coronavirus testing to close associates, including his brother.<br />Assemblyman Charles Lavine, a Democrat from Nassau County who oversees the probe, hasn’t set a time frame for the inquiry but said it would be thorough and expeditious. He said last month that investigators have been in touch with 75 potential witnesses and reviewed thousands of pages of documents. The chamber has a contract with an outside law firm for $250,000; Mr. Lavine said the amount would be increased as needed.<br />The Democratic governor has said he did nothing wrong and is cooperating with investigations into his conduct and administration. He has also said he never touched anybody inappropriately and has apologized if his office behavior made anyone uncomfortable.</td>

      <td>President Biden seems to have made some modest progress at the weekend meeting of G-7 leaders in his effort to rally a united front against China’s violations of global norms. And we mean modest.<br />The final G-7 communique makes a fleeting reference to “the situation in the East and South China Seas,” without specifying that the “situation” is China’s takeover and militarization of atolls in violation of international law. There is also a mention of Hong Kong and Xinjiang in the context of “human rights and fundamental freedoms,” and “the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”<br />On economics and trade there is also this: “With regard to China, and competition in the global economy, we will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy.” Continue to consult?<br />Mr. Biden often criticized Donald Trump’s China policy for not involving allies, and he had a point. China practices divide-and-conquer politics internationally, and Chinese mercantilism is best resisted by an alliance of democracies that can show Beijing it can’t play one off against another. The Trump Administration pulled this off in the case of Huawei, if not on other trade issues.<br />But the weakness of “multilateralism” is that it requires unity of purpose that can be defeated by the lowest-common-denominator participant. European leaders are reluctant to put their exports to China at risk with too forceful a stance. That’s why they’ve merely mumbled criticism of China’s decision to strangle the autonomy that Beijing promised Hong Kong in its treaty with Britain. If the communique’s nice words mean anything, the G-7 leaders will have to do far more than “continue to consult” to counter China’s trade depredations, intellectual property theft, and threats against its neighbors.</td>

      <td>The Senator and President Biden want to put the agency beyond annual appropriations.</td>
      <td>The Internal Revenue Service leak of taxpayer returns to left-leaning media outlet ProPublica is a prime example of why Congress should refuse to give the tax agency more money and power. That includes President Biden’s little-noticed but politically consequential plan to put IRS funding on autopilot.<br />An overlooked part of Mr. Biden’s plan to supercharge the IRS would exclude most of its funding over the next decade from Congress’s annual appropriations. His plan calls for a “dedicated stream of mandatory funds ($72.5 billion over a decade)” that will “provide for a sustained, multi-year commitment to revitalizing the IRS that will give the agency the certainty it needs to rebuild.” By “certainty” Mr. Biden means insulating the agency from accountability to Congress and its power of the purse.<br />Like so much else in the Biden Presidency, this follows the Elizabeth Warren model. The Massachusetts Senator last month introduced a bill that would nearly triple the annual IRS budget to $31.5 billion, which would be indexed to inflation and come from money “in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated," such as from interest that the Federal Reserve earns from its asset portfolio. This is what Ms. Warren and Democrats did when they created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which gets its funding directly from the Fed.<br />The IRS would essentially become another mandatory budget program like Social Security and Medicare. Its funding would be automatic and not subject to the annual Congressional review that affects “discretionary” spending for most federal departments, including the Pentagon. Congress could still haul the IRS Commissioner up for hearings. But without the risk of having to answer to Congressional appropriators for its budget, the tax agency would have little to worry about.<br />Republicans in Congress cut the IRS budget during the Obama Presidency after the agency targeted conservative nonprofits in the Lois Lerner debacle. Democrats say the cuts have frustrated tax enforcement. Their plan would make sure the IRS doesn’t have to pay a price in the future for politically targeting taxpayers or leaking returns. The potential for abuse would grow since Mr. Biden’s plan would also give the IRS access to bank account inflows and outflows.</td>

      <td>A new government takes power, but many parties led to years of stalemate.</td>
      <td>The recent Israel-Hamas war showed that no matter America’s efforts to disentangle itself from the Middle East, events in the Jewish State will continue to reverberate in Western politics. On Sunday, after months of wrangling, Israel swore in a new Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett, for the first time since 2009. What are the lessons for the U.S.?<br />First, the new government could clarify the American debate over Israel. The departure of the conservative Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister won’t change Democratic Party disagreements with Israel’s government over Iran and the Palestinians. The ideologically mixed government depends on support from three conservative parties, including Mr. Bennett’s Yamina, and even Israeli centrists are unlikely to yield much on either issue.<br />Israel’s critics abroad painted Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud party as their foil. Now Likud is out of government, but Israeli voters still don’t accept the dovish security policies that the American left wants. Yet in a Biden Administration staffed with Obama alumni who personally dislike Mr. Netanyahu, the selection of the centrist Yair Lapid as foreign minister and alternate Prime Minister could smooth over diplomacy—a likelihood that couldn’t have escaped the notice of Israel’s political class.<br />The new government won the historic support of an Arab party. Mansour Abbas’s Ra’am was courted by both Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Lapid. With a 60-59 vote in the Knesset, the new government had no room for error and Mr. Abbas was decisive in providing a majority. America’s ethnic divisions are very different from Israel’s, but the development shows the political leverage that can accrue to minority groups when their votes are sought by multiple factions.<br />The Israeli political saga also highlights the importance of political certainty. Israel had four inconclusive elections since 2019, and the new government might also be short-lived. That’s due to Israel’s system of proportional representation. Instead of competing to represent one geographic district after partisan primaries, Israeli politicians stand for parties that are elected at-large. Because parties can get into the Knesset with as little as 3.25% of the vote, 13 are currently represented.</td>

      <td>The mania to rechristen holidays reaches its illogical conclusion.</td>
      <td>The progressive mania for erasing names continues apace. Last week the board of education in Randolph, N.J., voted unanimously to remove named holidays from the school calendar.<br />The trouble began when the board rechristened Columbus Day “Indigenous Peoples Day.” Parents and students—many of them Italian-Americans—protested the change. They rightly dissent from the fashionable practice of treating the great explorer as a criminal. A local media report described the large crowd gathered at the board meeting as overwhelmingly and raucously hostile to the proposal.<br />Rather than restore Columbus’s name, however, the board came up with the rather less than Solomonic solution of scrapping all holiday names. Henceforth every school break—Memorial Day, Thanksgiving, Martin Luther King Day—will bear the name “day off.” That, predictably, satisfied almost nobody, and the controversy appears far from over.<br />Randolph’s parents deserve praise for refusing to accept this hooey without a fight. We would say the same about the San Francisco parents who forced the city’s school board to stand down from its idiotic attempt to remove the names Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, among others, from its schools.<br />Some names may deserve to go. The trustees of Clemson University last year voted to rechristen Tillman Hall, named for the proudly racist politician of a century ago. They’ll get no argument from us. But the urge to remove monuments, rename buildings and expunge holiday appellations has become an unwholesome obsession on the political left.</td>

      <td>Larry Murphree placed small American flags in potted plants outside the front door of his condominium in Jacksonville, Fla., in 2013. The condo association objected, citing its guidelines that limit display of the flag to an area near the garage door.<br />Facing a $1,000 fine, Mr. Murphree filed suit, arguing that the Freedom to Display the American Flag Act, a federal law that prohibits condo associations from imposing certain restrictions on the placement of U.S. flags, protected his right to adorn his greenage with the red, white and blue. In Murphree v. Tides Condominium at Sweetwater (2014), a federal court ruled against Mr. Murphree, concluding that the 2006 law has no enforcement mechanism.<br />Monday is Flag Day, which commemorates the adoption in 1777 of the U.S. flag. For condominium dwellers, celebrating could prove challenging. On account of condo by-laws dictating the appearance of units, it isn’t always Yankee Doodle Dandy when members wish to fly the American flag. Courts have addressed disputes of all stripes.<br />In 2005 Michael Readnour erected a 20-foot flagpole adjacent to his condominium in Columbus, Ohio. His condo association raised a stink. Mr. Readnour sought to have a court permit the two-story mast under the state’s American Flag Act, which specifically prevents a condo association from prohibiting a flagpole used to display the American flag. But in Readnour v. Blendon Reserve Condominium Association (2009), a Buckeye State judge concluded that the legislation still allowed a ban on flagpoles “out of proportion to the architecture and decor of the condominium community.”<br />In Board of Managers of Clinton West Condominium v. Desmond (2018), a condo association sought a preliminary injunction to remove an American flag and pole that Edward Desmond had attached to the exterior of his unit. Mr. Desmond argued that the flag “is not a plant, planter or shoe sitting on [his] window sill,” but serves to honor those, including some in his family, who fought in the nation’s wars. He sought protection under a state law that exempted compliance with any condo by-laws that preclude display of an American flag not larger than 4 by 6 feet.</td>

      <td>His proposed levy on unrealized capital gains would hit some modest estates especially hard.</td>
      <td>President Biden proposes to “eliminate the loophole that allows the wealthiest Americans to entirely escape tax on their wealth by passing it down to heirs.” A White House “fact sheet” claims that “our tax laws allow these accumulated gains to be passed down across generations untaxed, exacerbating inequality.”<br />In fact, while most Americans can pass wealth to their heirs without incurring federal taxes, “the wealthiest” can’t. The federal estate tax applies when the person who has died has a net worth of $11.7 million or more (or twice that for married couples), and it rises to 40% after the first $1 million in taxable assets. Mr. Biden’s American Families Plan would subject many estates worth far less than $11.7 million to a punishing new death tax.<br />The plan would raise the total top rate on capital gains, currently 23.8% for most assets, to 40.8%—higher than the 40% maximum estate tax. It would apply the same tax to unrealized capital gains at death, exempting only the first $1 million ($2 million for a married couple) plus $250,000 for a personal residence.<br />To understand how uneven the burden of this tax is, consider a hypothetical taxpayer for whom it would be especially heavy: a woman who, as a young widow decades ago, bought a home in New York City for $250,000, reared her children there, and never remarried. The property is now worth $2.5 million and is her only asset. If she dies after the Biden plan becomes law, the estate itself wouldn’t be taxable, but it would be subject to the new death tax on $1 million of the unrealized gain from the home (the $2.25 million appreciation less the $1.25 million in exemptions). Her grown children would inherit $408,000 less than under current law. The Biden tax would be based on the value of the asset, not the equity, so the estate would be liable for the full amount regardless of any mortgage outstanding.<br />Now consider an actual couple who would likely escape the new tax entirely. Joe and Jill Biden have an estimated net worth of $8 million, according to Forbes. Mr. Biden’s disclosures indicate that their assets consist of two personal residences along with several annuities and life insurance policies. The only assets that would be subject to a capital-gains tax at death would be their two homes, the appreciation on which likely amounts to less than the $2.5 million in exemptions for a married couple.</td>

      <td>Basing school enrollment on residence has made education more segregated than it was 40 years ago.</td>
      <td>Where you live often determines which public schools you can attend and which schools you can’t. Amid a national racial reckoning and a housing shortage only getting worse, you’d think equity warriors like the nation’s teacher unions and urbane progressives with access to the best schools would be fighting to overturn a policy rooted in 1930s-era redlining.<br />Don’t hold your breath. They helped design this system, and they’re invested in it for the long haul. Which is why a solution that frees families and unleashes our creativity is the best solution available.<br />In many states, it’s a crime for parents to send their children to a school for which they are not zoned, regardless of whether or not another school can better serve a student’s individual needs. Families desperate to enroll their kids in better public schools frequently lie about where they live to enroll their children in a public school outside of their school district. In some states school official hire off-duty police to follow kids home and make sure they’re living in the correct school district or school zone. This isn’t what public education is supposed to be.<br />Fortunately, there’s growing pushback. In April, Arizona joined other states in advancing open-enrollment legislation, taking a major step toward erasing school boundary lines. With some limitations, parents would be free to enroll their children into any public school in the state they want—no matter where they live. Teacher unions and bureaucrats hate it because parents can choose which school gets the money allocated for their child’s education. More states should give power back to families to choose the best education option for their children.<br />The current system leaves America’s public schools more segregated now than they were 40 years ago. In Atlanta, a single residential road, Drew Valley Road, divides two school attendance zones. Ashford Park, north of the road, serves a population that is 80% white, while John R. Lewis, south of the road, serves a population that is 70% Hispanic and 9% black. Those on the south side of the street aren’t allowed to enroll in Ashford Park, a top elementary school in the district whose students perform well on standardized tests.</td>

      <td>Biden presents a false choice between total withdrawal and ‘forever wars.’</td>
      <td>I had the opportunity this month to visit and thank U.S. troops stationed around the world. Some of our troops are too young to remember 9/11, but that day is etched in my memory and the heart of our nation.<br />The threat we saw that day is why we went to Afghanistan in 2001. The conditions on the ground had created an incubator for terrorists with international ambitions. Our troops went to prevent further attacks on the U.S. and our allies.<br />Unfortunately, President Biden chose to ignore the conditions on the ground and withdraw all U.S. troops by Sept. 11 of this year—a purely political decision. The Biden administration pretends there are only two options: unconditional U.S. withdrawal, or a “forever war.” Nobody wants to see U.S. troops in Afghanistan forever. But there is a third option: maintaining a relatively small troop presence until the conditions outlined in the 2020 U.S.-Taliban Agreement are fully implemented.<br />As we saw after President Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, terrorists will exploit a security vacuum. Two and a half years after U.S. troops left Iraq, ISIS captured Mosul. It took five years, tens of thousands of troops and more than 30,000 airstrikes to destroy the physical caliphate.<br />An expert report to the United Nations Security Council forecasts a similar outcome in Afghanistan now and observes that al Qaeda and other militants are celebrating President Biden’s decision as a “victory . . . for global radicalism.”</td>

      <td>A federal judge in Texas ruled that a major hospital system in Houston can require its employees to be vaccinated against Covid-19, dismissing a lawsuit brought by workers who claimed the mandate unlawfully forced them to be human “guinea pigs.”<br />U.S. District Judge Lynn N. Hughes on Saturday upheld the Houston Methodist system’s vaccine requirement, the first time a federal court has ruled on the legality of such an employer mandate due to the pandemic, according to the plaintiffs’ attorney.<br />In late March, Houston Methodist became the first major healthcare system in the U.S. to require Covid-19 vaccinations for its existing employees and new hires. The system, which employs more than 26,000 people, says employee vaccinations are essential to keeping patients safe.<br />More than 100 of its workers filed suit against the requirement in late May. They contended that the federally approved vaccines are experimental and dangerous and likened Houston Methodist’s requirement to Nazi medical experiments on concentration-camp prisoners during the Holocaust. Among other claims, the suit said the system’s policy violated a federal law governing the protection of “human subjects.”<br />In a five-page ruling, Judge Hughes said the Nazi comparison was “reprehensible” and that the lawsuit’s legal assertions misinterpreted the law and completely lacked merit.</td>

And across the court, a 22-year-old from Athens was starting to look like the Greek god of clay.<br />But if there’s one tennis situation that perhaps no player in history has handled better than Djokovic, it’s needing five sets to win. Trusting his endurance, the best defensive player the game has ever seen clawed his way back into Sunday’s French Open final against Stefanos Tsitsipas—and then simply overwhelmed him.<br />With a 6-7(6), 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 victory, Djokovic claimed his 19th major title and his second of the year. Now the only man in the Open era to win every major at least twice, he is chasing the first calendar-year Grand Slam in men’s tennis since Rod Laver pulled it off in 1969 — a goal he and his coaches are not shying away from.<br />“Everything is possible,” Djokovic said. “And I did put myself in a good position to go for the Golden Slam.”<br />Djokovic also sits just one major behind the all-time men’s record of 20, currently held by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. The way things stand, he appears better positioned to add to his haul than either of his closest rivals. Federer, 39, pulled out of the French Open after the third round to nurse a knee that has been operated on twice in the past 18 months. Nadal, meanwhile, looked short of his usual dominant self here on clay and has won only one major on any other surface in the past three years.</td>

The elastic-limbed Serbian, who reached this clay court final by summiting what he calls the hardest mountain in tennis—Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros—remains perhaps the toughest out in all of sports. He’s a champion who cannot be declared kaput until the stadium staff are flipping off the lights, brushing the courts and rolling up the nets—and probably not even then, either.<br />Tennis has long known: Novak Djokovic is seldom really on the ropes.</td>

Wrangling over Brexit bled into the meeting, coloring what appeared to be a broadly successful summit.<br />The U.K. left the bloc last year following the 2016 Brexit referendum, and at the start of this year departed the bloc’s customs union and single market. That put into effect a convoluted deal to manage trade and preserve peace in Northern Ireland after Brexit that has since been the subject of a tense dispute between Mr. Johnson’s government and the EU.<br />The so-called Irish protocol avoided a border on the island of Ireland by creating in effect an economic border in the Irish Sea with customs and regulatory checks being carried out on goods sent to Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. and with tariffs being levied on some products.<br />Mr. Johnson says the implementation of the deal threatens the territorial integrity of the U.K.; the EU, including Ireland, says Mr. Johnson signed the deal, so he should carry out what he agreed to.</td>

That would appease politicians in member states like South Africa and India who were unhappy with the way ordinary people named new virus strains after the country where they were first discovered: “the South African variant,” “the Indian variant.”<br />Feathers were ruffled.<br />“It is almost inevitable that some will mistakenly think the birds carry or are responsible for Covid, putting robins and pelicans at risk the world over,” one commenter on a research paper protested. “If the ‘Robin’ variant takes off, you will be impacting my daughter and every other person named Robin,” complained another.<br />It’s hard to find a good name for a bad virus. In December, the WHO began brainstorming an easy-to-remember system for naming coronavirus variants that would be acceptable to 190-some member states, and the vast community of scientists who follow, and often nitpick, the agency’s recommendations.</td>

      <td>Covid isolation got you tongue-tied? Here are tips for getting the hot air flowing again.</td>
      <td>The loudmouth at the cocktail party was on a roll. “We need to move the Overton window about the Tullock paradox.” Heads nodded in agreement, but most, like me, were clueless. Summer social season is here but our conversation skills are rusty and crusty. After 15 months of isolation, I can talk to my wife, kids and dogs. But interacting with friends and acquaintances at barbecues or overpriced coffee bars? Tough going. Over Memorial Day weekend, it was clear that my go-to questions—“What have you been up to? Been anywhere recently?”—are irrelevant and completely worthless.<br />I was familiar with the Overton window—what’s currently acceptable in the political mainstream—but had to look up the Tullock paradox: If it’s so cheap to buy off politicians, why doesn’t everybody? I can toss out quippy H.L. Mencken quotes when needed, like “Nature abhors a moron,” but man, I’ve got to step up my game.<br />These are extreme times. We all need an almost remedial course in conversation, beyond our usual monosyllabic babble, especially mine. So here’s a handy guide to stick it to your co-conversants and have their heads nodding at your bon mots in sublime stupefaction.<br />First, it’s always good to reference someone long dead, especially with a foreign twist. Throw around phrases like the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon: After noticing something for the first time, like how Grand Rapids constantly pops up in the news, you tend to notice almost every day. Or casually mention someone is afflicted by Munchausen syndrome—faking sickness. They’re so easy to slip into conversations. See how many heads nod with bewildered eyes. Don’t explain yourself either—a magician never reveals.<br />Next, if someone launches on you about his investing prowess, especially trading crypto, I suggest a comeback such as, “Oh, that’s just a classic Veblen good.” That should stump him for a while. American economist Thorstein Veblen noted that many goods are more desirable the more expensive they become, even though they’re not any better. Like BMWs. Or Jimmy Choos. Or Cristal champagne. Or  GameStop  shares. If the crypto braggart, wearing a Rolex, actually knows what a Veblen good is, then correct yourself and say that actually it’s probably more of a Giffen good, a nonluxury good, like rice, that can see increased demand at higher prices. That’ll buy you some time to plot an exit strategy—needing another drink, hysterical coughing fit.</td>

But as a longtime student of Chinese Communist political language, I will need considerable persuading that the disease came from bats or a wet market. The linguistic evidence is overwhelming that Chinese leaders believe the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the source.<br />Many years ago a distinguished Chinese writer, Wu Zuxiang, explained to me that there is truth in Communist Party pronouncements, but you have to read them “upside down.” If a newspaper says “the Party has made great strides against corruption in Henan,” then you know that corruption has recently been especially bad in Henan. If you read about the heroic rescue of eight miners somewhere, you can guess that a mine collapse might have killed hundreds who aren’t mentioned. Read upside-down, there is a sense in which the official press never lies. It cannot lie. It has to tell you what the party wants you to believe, and if you can figure out the party’s motive—which always exists—then you have a sense of the truth.<br />A few years ago another outstanding Chinese writer, Su Xiaokang, brought me one step deeper. You Westerners, he explained, are too hung up on the question of whether propaganda is true or not. For the regime, truth and falsity are beside the point. A statement might be true, false or partly true. What matters is only whether it works. Does it advance the interests of the party? The top leaders hand out words and phrases for their minions to use, like trowels in a garden. The minions dig with them.<br />After the Communist Party locked down the city of Wuhan in winter 2020, a local writer named Fang Fang began recording the conditions and moods of the people around her and posting entries on the Internet. “Fang Fang’s Diary” quickly attracted a large following, and the author became known as “the conscience of Wuhan.” Michael Berry, a UCLA professor of Asian languages and cultures who was translating one of the author’s novels, went to work on her posts as well. They were published last summer by HarperCollins.<br />The book, “Wuhan Diary,” consists of plain truth-telling. It is unadorned, simple language that stood out in Wuhan only because no one else was daring to write anything. But the regime’s response was to attack Fang Fang more ferociously than any Chinese writer has been attacked since Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s. In his day, Mao had made “struggle” a transitive verb: to struggle someone was to surround him or her, in the street or on a stage, and hurl taunts, insults, threats and demands for confessions; no bystander would dare speak for the struggled for fear of becoming the next target. Verbal abuse often led to physical beatings, sometimes even to death.</td>

Instead of throwing up our hands and saying, “We just can’t do this fast enough to help solve the problem,” Americans should demand that critical minerals come from U.S. mines whenever possible because that is the best way to protect the environment and miners and minimize carbon emissions.<br />Appeals and litigation are currently threatening and delaying U.S. critical-minerals mining projects for lithium, copper, antimony and cobalt. The Biden administration should declare a critical-minerals emergency and mandate immediate changes to the glacially paced and litigious permitting process.<br />Setting timelines for regulatory agencies’ reviews and permitting decisions and limiting mining opponents’ use of administrative appeals and litigation to challenge permits would shave years off the permitting process.

      <td>Shrinking labor force lowers the bar for when monetary stimulus can be dialed back</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve officials have long said a key condition for raising interest rates is a return to maximum employment. Their evolving views about how much job growth that will entail could lead them to roll back support for the economy sooner than previously expected.<br />Policy makers are likely to discuss when and how to start reducing monthly purchases of bonds, a prelude to eventually raising rates, at a meeting this Tuesday and Wednesday. They have said since December that to justify reducing bond purchases, the economy needed to make “substantial further progress” toward maximum employment and sustained 2% inflation.<br />The Fed has never put a number on its full employment target. Still, central bankers for months have compared current employment to the number of jobs in February 2020, before the pandemic hit the U.S. economy, to illustrate the ground that needed to be made up. Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this year that gap was “one way of counting it.” In May, the shortfall stood at 7.6 million jobs.<br />But in recent weeks, policy makers have become less confident the economy can recover all the jobs lost amid the pandemic without spurring inflation. Employers added fewer payrolls than expected in April and May, even as the economy grew rapidly, wages rose and other indicators pointed to a shortage of workers. The unemployment rate also continued to fall, to a pandemic low of 5.8%. In part that is because fewer people are returning to the labor force in search of work. The number of people who are working or want to work is still 3.5 million shy of February 2020, and the labor-force participation rate, at 61.6%, is down from 63.3% then.<br />The Fed believes many factors holding back the labor force are tied to the pandemic and will fade later this year.</td>

The review will include a practice known as payment for order flow, in which brokerages send many of their customers’ orders to trading firms in exchange for cash payments. Virtu’s stock sold off sharply after Mr. Gensler’s remarks.<br />Payment for order flow has existed for decades and has come under scrutiny before. But it received fresh attention after the wild volatility in GameStop shares in January. At one congressional hearing in February, Rep. Sean Casten (D., Ill.) referred to Robinhood Markets Inc.’s practice of sending orders to high-speed traders as “a conduit to feed fish to sharks.”<br />Firms such as Robinhood and Virtu say payment for order flow is misunderstood. They say small investors benefit from the practice because it results in better prices than they would get at public exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and the  Nasdaq Stock Market .

      <td>Controversy surrounding Biogen’s Aduhelm could ignite political firestorm over high drug prices, but investors should look past any D.C. drama</td>
      <td>Wall Street is rightfully celebrating the first approval of an Alzheimer’s disease treatment in nearly two decades. A familiar threat is likely to re-emerge, but investors won’t likely be caught off guard.<br />The Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to  Biogen ’s  drug Aduhelm on Monday. Significant controversy surrounds the approval. An outside committee of experts assembled by the FDA recommended not to approve the drug last year. Three members of the committee have since resigned over the decision, which one former member called a debacle.<br />Dust-up or not, stock prices are moving higher. Biogen shares rocketed 38% higher that day, and the rest of the sector has come along for the ride.  Eli Lilly ,  which has a similar Alzheimer’s drug under development, rallied 10% on Monday. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index rose 6% for the week.<br />There is reason to expect the trend to continue. Alzheimer’s has been a particularly confounding corner of drug research for decades; a 2018 analysis found that 146 experimental drugs had failed in clinical trials over the past 20 years.<br />In a flash, that history suddenly matters little. The FDA’s decision to approve Aduhelm despite significant concerns over its efficacy changes the outlook for those research efforts. Now, drugs that reduce the buildup of a substance known as amyloid, like Aduhelm, seem more likely to reach the market. Even the perception of a more forgiving regulatory agency is enough to spark fresh enthusiasm for biotech, and not only for companies with an Alzheimer’s program. For instance, regulatory flexibility would boost the business prospects of biotechs working to develop drugs that treat rare diseases.</td>

The insurer is one of the state’s largest carriers, with more than 1.5 million California residential policyholders. Many insurers have retreated from communities susceptible to wildfires, sending homeowners to the California FAIR Plan for their coverage.<br />Farmers will continue to use a longtime model that assesses the wildfire risk of the geographic area around a property, said Keith Daly, president of personal lines for Farmers. By adding Zesty.ai’s technology, the insurer will be able to take a more targeted approach, he said. While a particular area might have a higher risk of fire, a property within that area might not have the same level of risk.<br />“We are trying to create a solution” for homeowners who are struggling to buy insurance, Mr. Daly said.</td>

The score seemed suspect but Amazon itself was the seller, so I added it to my cart anyway.<br />The device arrived a day later, along with a clue to all that customer satisfaction. A small orange insert offered a $35 gift card—roughly half of the product’s price—with instructions on how to redeem the gift: “Email us A. Your order ID (screenshot) B. Your review URL (or screenshot).”<br />Since the fast-charging tech is new to the market, “We want to see how people like it,” said Donny Dong, vice president of sales at Sunvalley, the parent of RAVPower. He said the company didn’t force customers to leave five stars in order to claim a gift card.<br />An Amazon spokesman said the insert violates the company’s policy, which bans sellers from offering a financial reward for reviews.<br />Gift-card rewards are a common approach employed by sellers—even, in the case of RAVPower, Amazon’s wholesale vendors—to entice customers to rate products. They are also a reminder of how difficult it is for Amazon to police the manipulation of reviews, even on products it sells directly. The purchases are genuine, and the compensation is coordinated through email, out of Amazon’s view.</td>

      <td>Maybe inflation isn’t transitory after all</td>
      <td>Investors have faith in the Fed. Over the past three months consumer prices, excluding volatile food and energy, have risen 2%, equivalent to a shockingly high annual rate of 8.2%. Rather than panic and dump bonds, investors have piled into Treasurys and pushed 10-year yields back down to where they stood in late February. Confidence in the central bank is absolute.<br />To be fair, the Fed is probably right: This burst of inflation is probably transitory. The reopening of the economy released a surge of pent-up demand, while supply bottlenecks are restricting production and distribution. As things get back to normal inflation should calm down.<br />But investors need to consider the possibility that the Fed is wrong, too. The risk that inflation continues to overshoot is clearly much higher than usual, while the risk of undershooting is lower. Instead of leaving a larger margin of error around forecasts, bond markets are leaving little, perhaps none, with a yield of just 1.45% on the 10-year Treasury. The bond market’s best guess on long-term consumer-price inflation, the break-even rate for the five years starting in five years’ time, is down from a peak of 2.38% to just 2.23%; that implies inflation slightly below the Fed’s target on its preferred price gauge.<br />Even short-term inflation expectations are priced for the Fed to hit its target after a brief bout of inflation in the next 12 months. If that proves mistaken, bond yields and inflation break-evens—the gap between ordinary and inflation-linked Treasurys—should be higher, and big technology stocks should be lower.<br />As Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked research at Barclays, points out, the Fed was right the last time it bet on inflation being transitory, in 2011. The European Central Bank’s two rate increases that year are widely seen as a mistake that contributed to the region’s economic troubles.</td>

The Tuesday announcement could accelerate the push to phase out the troubled interest-rate benchmark, which underpins trillions of dollars worth of financial contracts. Authorities decided several years ago, after a widespread Libor-rigging scandal, that it should disappear by the end of 2021.<br />The new guidelines are from a CFTC subcommittee working under an initiative dubbed “SOFR First.” It is meant to persuade market players to adopt SOFR, or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, as Libor’s replacement. SOFR is the alternative preferred by regulators and many major banks.<br />As of July 26, big banks like  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. will see certain derivatives priced in SOFR rather than Libor on dealer screens. Libor conventions will remain for information purposes only.<br />“A lot of this is about inertia,” said Tom Wipf, a Morgan Stanley banker. “We face a reality of no new Libor contracts by the end of this year.

It is made up of parties from across the political spectrum, including an independent Arab party for the first time in Israel’s history. Mr. Bennett and his partners put together their alliance after Mr. Netanyahu failed to cobble his own coalition following national elections in March.<br />Mr. Bennett’s eight-party coalition has the backing of 61 lawmakers in the 120-member Knesset and is expected to pass the confidence vote by a simple majority.<br />If the vote passes, Mr. Bennett would take power at a pivotal moment in the country’s history. Four inconclusive elections since 2019 have left Israel deeply polarized. Now, Israeli politicians must try to mend those rifts even as they confront divisive issues ranging from settlement construction and empowering the country’s Arab citizens to state assistance for ultra-Orthodox Jews.<br />More immediately, the government needs to take steps to boost the economy after several lockdowns last year to contain the spread of Covid-19 while also negotiating a longer-term truce deal with Gaza ruler Hamas after the two sides fought a deadly 11-day conflict in May.</td>

      <td>As the pandemic clouds lift, the percentage of Americans leaving employers for new opportunities is at its highest level in more than two decades</td>
      <td>More Americans are quitting their jobs than at any other time in at least two decades, adding to the struggle many companies face trying to keep up with the economic recovery.<br />The wave of resignations marks a sharp turn from the darkest days of the pandemic, when many workers craved job security while weathering a national health and economic crisis. In April, the share of U.S. workers leaving jobs was 2.7%, according to the Labor Department, a jump from 1.6% a year earlier to the highest level since at least 2000.<br />The shift by Americans into new jobs and careers is prompting employers to raise wages and offer promotions to keep hold of talent. The appetite for change by employees indicates many professionals are feeling confident about jumping ship for better prospects, despite elevated unemployment rates.<br />While a high quit rate stings employers with greater turnover costs, and in some cases, business disruptions, labor economists say churn typically signals a healthy labor market as individuals gravitate to jobs more suited to their skills, interests and personal lives.<br />In March 2020, Edward Moses was hired as an information-technology specialist at a software company, believing he would be part of a team supporting colleagues in four U.S. offices. Instead, after a round of layoffs, he found the team had one member, and he was it. “It was effectively me against the help-desk queue,” the 37-year-old says.</td>

      <td>FALMOUTH, England—The leaders of the Group of Seven nations on Sunday plan to set out a wide-ranging set of measures to combat climate change as they aim to almost halve their greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030.<br />The group of rich nations will pledge to funnel financing to developing countries to help them build infrastructure and accelerate a shift to renewable energy, according to the U.K. government, which is hosting the G-7 event.<br />Among other measures, G-7 leaders will commit to ending direct government support for overseas coal-power generation by the end of this year, the White House said.<br />Canada, Germany, the U.K. and the U.S. will also provide as much as $2 billion in financing to help developing countries transition away from coal, the White House said.<br />The leaders will outline steps they are taking to halt most government subsidies for overseas fossil-fuel producers and measures to phase out gasoline and diesel cars.</td>
