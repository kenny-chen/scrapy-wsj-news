      <td>Key moments and themes as Trump’s lawyers mounted their defense</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The fourth day of the Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump offered a chance for his lawyers to dispute Democrats’ charge that Mr. Trump was responsible for the riot that took place on Jan. 6. Then senators were permitted to ask both sides follow-up questions. Here are eight takeaways from Friday:<br />Mr. Trump’s defense team called Democrats’ allegations that he incited the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot “patently absurd.” “No thinking person could seriously believe that the president’s Jan. 6 speech on the Ellipse was in any way an incitement to violence or insurrection,” Trump lawyer Michael van der Veen said. He called the impeachment trial another part of a “witch hunt” by Democrats.<br />The defense team aired several montages of quick-cut footage of Democratic lawmakers using the word “fight,” arguing that Mr. Trump’s use of the word on Jan. 6 wasn’t unusual and is standard political fare. The video also included now-President Biden saying if he were in high school he would take Mr. Trump “behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.” Other clips the defense used were on the milder side, including a clip of Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia vowing to keep up the fight in a speech about mine workers’ health and retirement benefits. “Spare us the hypocrisy and false indignation,” said Mr. van der Veen. Democrats said the presentation made a false equivalence.<br />One of the defense team’s lawyers, Bruce L. Castor Jr., said Mr. Trump’s supporters couldn’t have taken his speech on Jan. 6 as a call for political violence because he was only urging members of Congress to fight to keep him in power—or else face primary challenges for re-election. “Listening to it as you have here, unedited by us, is it possible that President Trump’s disdain for political violence could be any clearer to the persons listening as he was speaking? Is it possible that his words could have been misunderstood?” Mr. Castor said. “I suggest to you that is impossible.”<br />Another of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, David Schoen, accused House Democrats of manipulating evidence and showing selectively edited videos and images during their presentation. A senior aide to the Democratic impeachment managers said that they had to re-create a tweet—because Mr. Trump’s  Twitter  account had been taken down—and there was an extraneous check mark but the text was the same. The Democrats said the defense’s accusation about selective video editing was false and accused Mr. Trump’s team of the same thing.</td>

      <td>The Louisiana Republican, a prolific note-taker during the proceedings, is a surprise swing vote</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Sen. Bill Cassidy emerged this week as a wild card in the trial over whether former President Donald Trump incited the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, and he said Friday he still hasn’t made up his mind.<br />The Louisiana Republican surprised colleagues Tuesday when he voted with Democrats to assert the constitutionality of the trial and move ahead with the proceedings. Headed into the final days of the case, he has walked a fine line. He said that he has found the Democrats’ arguments compelling and had questions for Mr. Trump’s lawyers. But he also has insisted that his recent action didn’t indicate whether he would vote to convict Mr. Trump.<br />“The American people are counting on us actually coming to this with a mind ready to receive information,” Mr. Cassidy said. “And, yes there’s people on both sides of it who want your mind made up right now. But there’s a lot at stake here.”<br />Mr. Cassidy didn’t state his position Friday. He was photographed reviewing notes of a document that appeared to point toward acquittal, but later said it was one of two press releases his staff had prepared for each position. “If I had flipped the page, you would have had the one going the other way,” he said.<br />The notes he held read: “the House managers did not connect the dots to show President Trump knew that the attack on the Capitol was going to be violent and result in the loss of life.”</td>

      <td>Company’s failure to provide gun safeguards is sufficient grounds for a class-action suit to proceed, judge says</td>
      <td>TORONTO—A Canadian court ruled Friday that victims of a 2018 shooting in Toronto have a viable legal claim of negligence against gun maker  Smith & Wesson Corp.  for failing provide safeguards on the gun used by the shooter.<br />Judge Paul Perell of the Superior Court of Ontario said in the ruling that a stolen Smith & Wesson handgun used by the shooter didn’t include available smart gun technology that restricts use to authorized individuals. Such a lapse, he said, is sufficient grounds for the families to proceed with their class action.<br />Canadian law requires judges to certify that class actions have a reasonable chance of success before they can proceed. The ruling clears the way for the case to continue.<br />“The immediate case may demonstrate that there came a time when it was careless for Smith & Wesson not to utilize invented authorized user technology, of which there were many types, some of which Smith & Wesson invented and patented,” Judge Perell said in his decision.<br />Smith & Wesson argued the case could have “industry shattering consequences” if a class action judge finds the company failed its legal duty to provide safeguards on the gun, the decision said. Malcolm Ruby, a lawyer for the victims said it could be a few years before a trial begins.</td>

Rival Uber Technologies Inc. also reported a smaller annual loss, on the back of its food-delivery business and aggressive cost cuts. Lyft shares gained 4.8% Wednesday.<br />Oracle Corp.<br />TikTok’s U.S. fate is in limbo again. The Biden administration shelved a plan to force a sale of the popular video-sharing app’s American operations to a group including Oracle and  Walmart Inc.  The deal was driven by former President Donald Trump, who last year ordered a ban on TikTok aimed at forcing a sale of the app to a majority-U.S.-ownership group. The TikTok deal has languished since last fall in the midst of successful legal challenges to the U.S. government’s effort by the app’s owner, Chinese tech company ByteDance Ltd. Oracle shares slipped 0.6% Wednesday.<br />Bumble Inc.</td>

      <td>Federal debt has reached 100% of GDP even before Biden’s plans become law.</td>
      <td>Does unrestrained federal spending have any economic cost? Can federal debt keep climbing to be larger than the entire U.S. economy without consequence? Sooner or later Americans are going to find out, as Congress and the Biden Administration use the pandemic to justify an unprecedented peacetime spending binge.<br />For the magnitudes involved, the best recent overview arrived this week in the annual Congressional Budget Office’s 10-year budget forecast. It deserves more attention than it’s receiving because Americans will be paying for it for decades.<br />CBO says federal spending reached $6.55 trillion in fiscal 2020, as Congress addressed the damage from Covid-19 and the government shutdowns. That’s about a $2.1 trillion increase in a single year, and understandably so given the uncertainty of the threat as it emerged in the spring. Notably, and in a pleasant surprise, revenue fell a mere 1.2% to $3.42 trillion as the economy held up better than expected. The deficit came in at a staggering $3.13 trillion, or a record 14.9% of GDP.<br />What about the future? CBO says not to expect much fiscal improvement this year, with spending still at 26.3% of GDP. The deficit will be $2.26 trillion or 10.3% of GDP. For comparison, the deficit during Barack Obama’s entire first term was $5.1 trillion, and the deficit as a share of GDP hasn’t been that high since 1945. Even at the height of the 1983 recession, it reached only 5.9%.<br />CBO projects spending to average 21.9% of GDP over the next decade under current law, but that doesn’t include Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid bill and other plans. Democrats are already promising another trillion-dollar “green” public works bill later this year. Investors must be expecting a subsidy blowout judging by the fantastic market valuations of electric car and renewable energy companies.</td>

      <td>His adviser admits to covering up New York’s nursing home deaths.</td>
      <td>Three months ago New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was awarded an Emmy for “his leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic and his masterful use of TV to inform and calm people around the world.” Turns out the Emmys had the right actor—but the wrong performance. Increasingly it looks like Mr. Cuomo’s real act was to keep people from finding out how many people in his state’s nursing homes died from Covid-19.<br />On Thursday the New York Post reported that Melissa DeRosa, the Governor’s top aide, admitted to Democratic leaders that the state had deliberately kept the true numbers from them. In a Wednesday conference call, Ms. DeRosa told Democrats the Cuomo administration rejected a legislative request for the figures last August because Donald Trump was tweeting that “we killed everyone in nursing homes” and was directing “the Department of Justice to do an investigation into us.”<br />As Ms. DeRosa put it, “Basically, we froze.” The administration wasn’t sure, she said, if any information it released to state lawmakers or the Department of Justice “was going to be used against us” or “if there was going to be an investigation.”<br />Nursing home deaths are a sensitive issue for Mr. Cuomo because of a March 25 health department directive that barred these homes from rejecting people because they had Covid-19. The Associated Press reports that 9,056 recovering patients were sent into nursing homes after the directive, more than 40% higher than what the state had previously reported.<br />In January state Attorney General Letitia James released a report on an investigation into complaints about how the nursing homes handled Covid-19. Two findings stand out. First, that “a larger number of nursing home residents died from COVID-19 than” the official data reflected. Second, that the March 25 directive “requiring the admission of COVID-19 patients into nursing homes may have put residents at increased risk of harm in some facilities and may have obscured the data available to assess that risk.”</td>

      <td>The White House has been cleaning cabinet agencies of Trump appointees, which is fair enough, but one rehire in particular is worth noting. The Labor Department is bringing back a career lawyer who was fired after she waged an unfounded years-long smear campaign against  Oracle .<br />Janet Herold spearheaded Labor’s 2017 lawsuit against Oracle, alleging systemic pay discrimination against women and minorities. The complaint was based on paint-by-numbers statistical patterns and found no evidence that Oracle intentionally discriminated. An administrative law judge eviscerated Ms. Herold’s complaint in September, noting in a 280-page opinion that “There was no good evidence for [Labor’s] allegation that Oracle’s executives knew about, hid, and ignored widespread disparities.”<br />This had long been clear, which is why one of Ms. Herold’s senior colleagues sought to settle the Oracle case for $10 million to $20 million. Yet Ms. Herold insisted it could be properly settled for no less than $150 million to $300 million. The largest such settlement in history is $14 million.<br />So why was Ms. Herold so adamant? “The most critical part of this enforcement action is the public airing and discussion of common industry pay practices which depress the wages of women and people of color,” she wrote to the department’s Solicitor, adding that a public trial would “damage [Oracle’s] reputation in the industry and hinder their ability to retain top talent.”<br />Ah. So the case was intended to be an identity-politics show trial. Ms. Herold also pushed allegations against Google of “systemic compensation and hiring discrimination” against women and Asians. Last week Google settled for a modest $3.8 million.</td>

The bank reduced other executives’ pay for the same reason, saying they shared responsibility for the problems. In the order, issued in October, regulators told Citigroup to fix its risk-management systems and flagged “significant ongoing deficiencies.”<br />Mr. Corbat’s pay included a $1.5 million salary, a $5.26 million cash bonus and $12.27 million in stock-based compensation.<br />The board said the bank’s financial results in the pandemic were strong. However, the bank’s risks and controls are one of the four “performance pillars” that determine Mr. Corbat’s compensation.<br />Mr. Corbat will retire at the end of the month from the nation’s third-biggest bank. He will be succeeded by Jane Fraser, the bank’s president and the first woman to lead a major Wall Street bank.</td>

      <td>Something stirring happened one evening last month at a family-style restaurant called Mrs. Potato in Orlando, Fla. By night’s end five strangers would each instinctively make crucial decisions. The result, according to police, was that the life of an 11-year-old boy likely was saved.<br />There is a lesson in what took place, and it starts with what a woman named Flaviane Carvalho saw.<br />She was serving meals to a table where a family of four was sitting. Three of the people—an adult male, an adult female, and a four-year-old girl—were sitting on one side, seemingly enjoying themselves. The boy was on the other side, not being spoken to and not speaking. He was the only one for whom the adults had not ordered food. Ms. Carvalho thought this was odd.<br />Then she noticed bruising near the boy’s eye, and a cut above his nose. And more bruising on his lower arm. She could have done nothing.<br />But she couldn’t just let it go. On a piece of paper, in big letters, she wrote: “ARE YOU OK?” She stood behind the table and held the paper up so only the boy, alone on the other side, could see it. He made a motion with his head. She sensed he was afraid. So she wrote another message: “DO YOU NEED HELP?”</td>

Happily for the next victim but not the latest one, the paper has belatedly seen the error of its ways.<br />Donald G. McNeil Jr. “has done much good reporting over four decades,” said management even as it escorted him out the door. Executive Editor Dean Baquet had previously declined to fire Mr. McNeil over the two-year-old incident, saying it was clear the term hadn’t been uttered in a “hateful or malicious” way.<br />But that was before a tsunami of intolerance from the forces of tolerance inside the paper. Mr. Baquet announced last week that Mr. McNeil would be leaving after all because “we do not tolerate racist language regardless of intent.” Oops, it was universally pointed out that the Times then would have to fire itself. A Factiva search shows the paper using the word 1,271 times as far back as 1969 and as recently as a week ago, as it must in covering the world. The new standard, “a threat to our journalism,” was “a deadline mistake and I regret it,” Mr. Baquet admitted on Thursday.<br />What a mess. I don’t know Mr. Baquet. By all accounts, he’s a fine person and a good reporter, but you know what he’s behaving like here—he’s behaving like somebody who knows he can’t trust his own boss to back him in any decision unpopular with the woke mob.<br />Contrary to myth, the last thing John Kennedy was saying in “Profiles in Courage” was that persons in authority at every moment should be ready to throw away their livelihoods over a matter of principle. Mr. Baquet won’t get advice from me on whether his job is now impossible, or, for that matter, whether it’s doubly important that he stick around for après moi reasons.</td>

      <td></td>
      <td>When she regained consciousness in a Chicago hospital in 1968, Bette Howland, then 31, couldn’t move, see or speak. “You will be reborn,” a mysterious voice told her. Appropriately enough, the voice turned out to belong to her mother. This scene of renewal marks the beginning of “W-3,” Howland’s account of her internment in the hospital’s psychiatric ward—and the reissuing of “W-3” signals the ongoing renewal of Howland’s career.<br />Between 1974 and 1983, Howland published three books: “W-3” and the story collections “Blue in Chicago” and “Things to Come and Go.” After winning a MacArthur fellowship in 1984, she stopped writing and disappeared from public view. Decades later, in 2015, Brigid Hughes, the editor of the literary journal A Public Space, discovered “W-3” in the dollar bin at a used bookstore. This revelation led to the appearance of “Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage,” Ms. Hughes’s selection of Howland’s writing, and to a revival of interest in the author’s brilliantly observant work.<br />Like her career, Howland’s psychological health suffered a precipitous dip. During the events of “W-3,” she was a young divorcée with two children, making do with a “dingy flat, crummy job, constant money worries. Everything you earn goes to doctors and baby-sitters. . . . A life full of reproaches, self-hatred.” Ultimately, these difficulties contributed to a suicide attempt—the reason she landed in the hospital.<br />Yet even as she describes her fantasy of ending it all, she can’t resist pointing out an absurd facet of her plan: It inevitably involves the medicine cabinet. “Now here’s a curiosity: Why the medicine cabinet? The pills were actually right beside my bed. But never mind, it seems there has to be a medicine cabinet . . .” Howland loves a good curiosity; her business, in “W-3” and throughout her oeuvre, is with the odd detail and the odd person out. Drawn to the eccentrics who populate Chicago—and her family in particular—she vividly renders the social worlds within the movie theater, the public library, the courtroom and the living room, attending to the essential strangeness of each person she describes: the librarian who irritates patrons by bellowing; the uncle who goes out of his way to break the law, driving “around the block looking for a No Parking sign or a nice little fire hydrant.” At the library, Howland writes in her dazzling story “Public Facilities,” “the level of tolerance for individual extremes was very high. It had to be—the facts were too peculiar.” But the library has nothing on W-3, the ward where this memoir takes place.<br />Howland’s fellow patients include Zelma, who shows up in evening dress and opera gloves, marching in “as if she owned the place,” with “seven pieces of matched luggage, smooth pale leather; two wigs with stands; a portable TV.” Whenever the phone rings in the ward, it’s for Zelma. Then there’s Trudy, who “perambulated down the corridors lashed to her intravenous stand—bandages, pajama strings loosened and streaming—looking like a sort of injured parade float.” “A poacher by nature, like a cuckoo,” she shows up uninvited in other people’s bathrooms, shower stalls and beds.</td>

      <td>An argument that links between the surge of migrants into Europe and a rise in violence against women must be addressed.</td>
      <td>‘This book is about mass migration, sexual violence, and the rights of women in Europe,” declares Ayaan Hirsi Ali in the introduction to “Prey.” A refugee from Somalia and a migrant herself, Ms. Hirsi Ali has given her book a title that is unsparing and indignant—intended, no doubt, to make us sit up and pay attention. She believes, and seeks to persuade us, that women in Europe are now the sexual quarry of young, unmoored men from Muslim countries over whom the police and the courts appear incapable of exercising control. “We in the West are used to seeing women everywhere around us,” she writes, before telling us that in certain quarters of Brussels, London, Paris and Stockholm “you suddenly notice that only men are visible.” These are no-go zones for women, who “erase themselves” from public places in such neighborhoods. “We are witnessing a challenge,” Ms. Hirsi Ali says, “to the rights that European women once took for granted.”<br />Almost three million people have arrived illegally in Europe since 2009, close to two million in 2015 alone. Two-thirds are male, and 80% of asylum applicants are under the age of 35. “The intensification of the Syrian civil war,” Ms. Hirsi Ali writes, “was the largest proximate cause for the migrant influx.” There is no shortage of data on Europe’s sexual violence in her book. Some examples: There was a 17% increase in rapes in France from 2017 to 2018; in Germany, the number of victims of rape and “sexual coercion” rose by 41% in 2017; and in Sweden, there was a 12% increase in reported sex offenses in 2016—astonishing ratios that may have abated recently, she explains, only due to restrictions resulting from Covid-19.<br />Ms. Hirsi Ali, a research fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, is a longstanding critic of extremist Islam. In “Prey,” she offers us page after page of grim statistics and asserts, credibly, that we can see “a prima facie case for the view that the surge of immigration into Europe” in 2015 led to “a significant increase in sexual violence in the countries that accommodated the largest numbers of migrants.” The migrants are from societies marked by patriarchy and polygamy, where women are “commodities.” These men, she explains, “see no reason to alter their views simply because they now live in western Europe.”<br />Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, draws Ms. Hirsi Ali’s ire for her decision in 2015 to do away with an upper limit on the number of asylum-seekers who could come to Germany. “It is one of the rich ironies of early-twenty-first-century history,” she writes, “that the single decision that has done the most harm to European women in my lifetime was made by a woman.”<br />The worst single incident of sexual assault by migrants occurred in Cologne on Dec. 31, 2015—New Year’s Eve—when hundreds of men (mostly newly arrived asylum-seekers of Arab and North African origin) “mobbed together to entrap women” in the area between the city’s central railway station and its storied cathedral. In the following months, 661 women came forward to report themselves as victims of sexual attacks that night. The official response was one of paralysis, as police and prosecutors struggled with the fear of being seen as racist. By the spring of 2019, a mere 52 of the alleged assailants had been indicted, of whom only three were convicted of sex offenses.</td>

      <td>Politicians begging Washington for a bailout have been doling out raises to government workers.</td>
      <td>As part of his proposed $1.9 trillion relief bill, President Biden wants to send $350 billion in unrestricted cash to state and local governments to fill their budget holes. But while Covid-19 has depressed state tax revenue, the prospect of federal aid has encouraged many of these supposedly blameless states to keep piling on costs. Nowhere has that been more evident than with the pay raises dished out in recent months to government employees. As private businesses hold on by their fingernails, public-sector labor unions have their hands out, demanding the pay raises set forth in labor contracts negotiated before the pandemic ravaged public finances.<br />In Connecticut, where unemployment was 8% in December after topping 10% this summer, state workers have pocketed two rounds of raises: a 3.5% bump in July and another worth about 2% earlier this month. Gov. Ned Lamont had initially suggested postponing the raises—“to lead by example”—but the labor union 1199 SEIU blitzed the airwaves with television commercials accusing unnamed politicians of wanting to “take away” their wages. Mr. Lamont folded.<br />In December, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan let planned 2% raises continue, claiming revenues “have improved enough for us to be able to fulfill our commitments to state employees.” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo used special powers to postpone certain planned hikes for state employees. But Mr. Cuomo has indicated he’ll use federal aid to pay those raises retroactively, and let others continue outright. Most New York school districts went ahead with raises this summer.<br />Automatic pay increases regardless of economic conditions are an unimaginable proposition in the private economy. Many government employees collected their full pay and benefits while not working during the spring 2020 lockdowns. The pandemic has laid bare a fundamental problem with public-sector collective bargaining: Taxpayers should never be on the hook for raises that don’t reflect future economic realities—especially when politicians have a personal interest in pushing costs into the future.<br />That’s essentially what’s happened in New Jersey, where Gov. Phil Murphy withdrew his threat to lay off state workers after his largest union agreed to take furlough days and postpone—but not forgo—raises. Affected employees will get three pay bumps totaling 6% beginning this summer, though most won’t come due until after Mr. Murphy faces voters in November.</td>

But New York’s failure to publicly acknowledge its nursing home death toll and prioritize the protection of the elderly—the state instead inflicted broad, destructive lockdowns on the general population—had consequences far beyond New York. The state was an early virus hot spot and its false data presented a misleading picture of Covid impact as scientists and policy makers sought to understand the new health threat.<br />In the wake of the Post report, Jesse McKinley and Luis Ferré-Sadurní of the New York Times note:<br />One wonders how long the truth about nursing home deaths might have remained hidden if a few stout-hearted contrarians like Janice Dean of Fox News, the Albany Times-Union newspaper and the Empire Center think tank had not diligently challenged the official story.</td>

      <td>The answer to Francis X. Rocca’s “Can Catholic Social Teaching Unite a Divided America?” (Review, Feb. 6) is, unfortunately, no. Catholic social teaching may have something for both left and right, but the progressive wing of Roman Catholicism has more in common with secular progressives than with conservative Catholics and other Christians. Closing the ideological and moral divide within the U.S., Catholicism and Christianity in general is not likely to be a win-win. One side considers loving and taking care of your neighbors to be a personal responsibility. The other wants the state to take care of neighbors in need by taking resources from other neighbors. Conservative Christians will render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, as instructed, but do not expect Caesar to relieve us of all obligations to neighbors, nor will we ever expect Caesar to create a progressive heaven on earth.<br />Ryan Graham<br />Melbourne, Fla.<br /><br />The conservative Catholics’ point is that if Joe Biden continues to support abortion, he and others like him cannot have a meaningful discourse on real solutions to what ails society because a fundamental understanding is missing: God is love. All of God’s creation has value and must be loved. Trying to solve social issues without having the conversation about the value of human life is like trying to grow a plant without acknowledging the critical element of its root system.</td>

President Trump’s gains with blacks and Hispanics demonstrated that their political convictions are more malleable, which Mr. Alba attributes in part to “racial mixing.” No doubt intermarriage and a more complex idea of racial and ethnic identity contribute to that, but there is another powerful factor that moves people over time from left to right on the political spectrum, and it is strangely absent in debates in our “woke” culture: social class.<br />The left portrays racial and ethnic minorities (with the exception of Asians, Jews, and other successful groups) as hapless victims of historical oppression, and who are now in need of government (i.e., taxpayer) largess to make up for those historical inequities.

Holman Correctional Facility to accommodate inmate Willie B. Smith III’s final request. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, filed a dissenting opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas separately indicated that he would let the execution proceed.<br />That means either Justice Samuel Alito or Justice Neil Gorsuch—or both—took Mr. Smith’s side.<br />Mr. Smith was convicted of the 1991 murder of Sharma Ruth Johnson, 22 years old, whom he and a teenage accomplice first kidnapped and robbed when she stopped at an ATM in Birmingham, Ala. The jury voted 10-2 for a death sentence instead of life imprisonment.<br />Alabama said Mr. Smith was being treated fairly because prison policy currently allows no inmate to have a minister alongside as they are put to death. Mr. Smith argued that a 2000 federal law, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, required the state to accommodate his request.</td>

      <td>The Washington, D.C., museum looks forward to its second century with a new exhibition, ‘Seeing Differently.’</td>
      <td>The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., America’s first museum dedicated to modern art, was the product of a pandemic. In 1918, the art collector Duncan Phillips lost his only brother, James, to the flu that was ravaging the globe; their father, a Civil War veteran and businessman, had died of a heart condition not long before. In 1921, Duncan Phillips honored their memory by turning his home into a museum, originally named the Phillips Memorial Art Gallery.<br />A century later, in the midst of another pandemic, the Phillips is celebrating its anniversary with a new exhibition, “Seeing Differently: The Phillips Collects for a New Century.” Scheduled to open March 6, Covid restrictions permitting, the show features about 250 works chosen from the museum’s collection of more than 6,000 objects. Senior curator Elsa Smithgall said that the exhibition organizers worked with a 13-member community advisory board, which hewed to Duncan Phillips’s collecting philosophy of embracing “a multiplicity of types of works and types of perspectives.” The results include paintings, quilts, sculpture, photographs, works on paper and videos by an international array of artists.<br />The centennial show is organized around “the way that artists explore the complexities of our ever-changing world through four lenses,” Ms. Smithgall said: the senses, identity, history and place. The first section, on the senses, is meant “to hit people with a really powerful sensory experience around color,” she explained, with works such as Alexander Calder’s 1939 wire sculpture “Hollow Egg” and Alma Thomas’s “Breeze Rustling Through Fall Flowers,” a 1968 acrylic on canvas with bands of rich color on a pale background. The 2011 work “Scramble” by Leo Villareal, a commanding five-foot-square grid of light-emitting diodes, hangs near quilts made in Gee’s Bend, Ala., that echo its bright squares.<br />Works in the identity section show “how art can open a window into our understanding of self and how we also see the other,” Ms. Smithgall said. Among them are “Melancholy,” Degas’s evocative portrait from the 1860s of a wistful woman curled into an armchair, and “Untitled (Hood 2),” a 2016 photograph by John Edmonds of an individual whose identity is hidden by a sweatshirt. “Maman Calcule,” a 2013 work by the Belgium-based Congolese artist Aimé Mpane, is a mosaic portrait of a woman in Kinshasa composed of hundreds of carved plywood tiles. There are also portraits by El Greco and Goya, along with self-portraits by Paul Cézanne, in full beard and high-collared jacket, and Milton Avery, in red beret and scarf, a cigarette drooping from his lips.<br />The history section of the show homes in on three topics: Revolution and War, Migration and Displacement, and Slavery and the Legacy of the Civil War. Among the works on display is Honoré Daumier’s “The Uprising,” a scene from 1848’s revolutionary events in France, in which a woman wearing a white shirt and cap surges forward amid the faces and top hats. Duncan Phillips acquired the painting in 1925 and considered it one of the finest in the collection. It is joined by 30 panels from Jacob Lawrence’s “Migration Series,” which chronicles the experiences of African-Americans heading to northern states in search of better lives.</td>

      <td>Civil-rights advocates abandon the old ideal for the new term, which ‘has no meaning’ and promises no progress but makes it easy to impute bigotry, says Shelby Steele.</td>
      <td>The first time Shelby Steele used the word “equity” in one of his books—“White Guilt,” published in 2006—he was referring to the value his father had accrued in restoring “three ramshackle homes to neat lower-middle-class acceptability.” This was in 1950s Chicago, a city the author describes as “virulently segregated.” Shelby Steele Sr., a Southern-born black truck driver who’d left school in third grade to work the fields, concealed his homeownership from his white employer. He was afraid he’d be fired for “getting above himself.”<br />No bank would loan the elder Steele money, so he used bricks, discarded lumber, and cast-off roofing shingles to render the properties rentable. “That’s what we used to call equity,” says Mr. Steele, the son. “The sense of the word I grew up with has no relationship at all to the meaning it has taken on today.”<br />Mr. Steele, 75, is a longstanding conservative commentator on race in America and a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. We speak over Zoom a week after President Biden signed an Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity, intended to address “entrenched disparities in our laws and public policies, and in our public and private institutions.” In his remarks at the signing, Mr. Biden seemed to suggest that his is a project aimed at reshaping American governance. “We need to make the issue of racial equity not just an issue for any one department of government,” the president said. “It has to be the business of the whole of government.”<br />I can almost hear Mr. Steele growl in his study in Monterey, Calif., as I read these words aloud. “This equity is a term that has no meaning,” he says, “but it’s one that gives blacks power and leverage in American life. We can throw it around at any time, and wherever it lands, it carries this stigma that somebody’s a bigot.” Its message is that there’s “inequality that needs to be addressed, to be paid off. So if you hear me using the word ‘equity,’ I’m shaking you down.”<br />Equity in this “new sense,” Mr. Steele says, can be understood only as “a strategy.” The president is promising to “fix America morally, and aligning himself with the strategy of black people to gain power by focusing on victimization. He’s saying, ‘America must tackle that problem and create programs that help minorities achieve equity’—whatever that may be.”</td>

      <td>As we’ve quarantined at home, our needs for privacy, security, flexibility, floppability and beauty have changed the way we want to live. Here, 13 décor trends courtesy of 2020.</td>
      <td>LAST AUGUST, interior-design blogger Lydia Elder found herself buying something that never would have darkened her door before the pandemic hit: a blush pink beanbag chair. “Schools were closed, and with our family of four at home all the time, we needed some extra, flexible seating,” she said. Now everyone in her 1,610-square-foot household in Kent, England—including her 6-foot-6-inch husband—is besotted with the smushy seat and, what's more, her young children have found it obligingly stands in for a volcano, mountain or quicksand. “It’s given us an extra place to relax that can be transferred across rooms depending on where the rest of the family is, and how much peace and quiet you want,” Ms. Elder said.<br />The trials of lockdown have led us to crave decorating solutions from easily hauled seats to lush wallpaper murals that transport us to inaccessible locales. As homeowners and interior designers have come up with intrepid fixes for current conundrums, the ingenuity has given rise to micro-trends. These 13 struck us as the most clever and doable.<br />The big, dark rectangle has always been a décor crasher, but with all the ever-present computers we need to work and learn remotely, the television is one more black hole. “We just don’t want to see [the TV] all the time anymore,” said Toronto designer Colette van den Thillart. She has concealed five of them since the pandemic started, hiding one behind a 1940s chinoiserie screen. In a London home library local designer Rose Uniacke camouflaged the telly behind fabric in the 1882 William Morris pattern of the wallpaper—to serenely seamless effect.<br />A seat with an undeniable nostalgia factor, the beanbag chair was introduced in 1969, when Italian designers Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro unveiled the Zanotta “Sacco” chair at the Paris Furniture Fair. Today the beanbag’s flexibility as a movable seat has brought it back as Americans struggle to improvise quiet spots in a crowded home. On Instagram, #beanbag counts 438,000 posts, and FatSak, a South African beanbag brand, reports a 200% spike in year-over-year sales this January. A rakish pompom denotes the top of one of our favorite blobs, a Hershey’s Kiss-shaped corduroy version. Corduroy Beanbag—Caramel, $165, burkedecor.com<br />Ms. van den Thillart admits she initially viewed rechargeable lamps with skepticism, fretting the light would be “crappy—too blue.” Still, seeking maximum flexibility from limited space, she decided to try them in her crowded home. After toting one from bedside to bathtub, she found it “completely life-changing. Every time I take one to a client, I lose it because they won’t give it back.” Philippe Malouin’s gracefully arched Arca Portable lamp has four settings, from ambient to task, and lasts up to 30 hours before needing a boost.  $275, mattermade.us</td>

      <td>The romantic label for swashbucklers used by Tampa Bay’s NFL team has the same Caribbean roots as a term for barbecuing pork</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />When the Tampa Bay Buccaneers celebrated their Super Bowl victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, they did so in a style befitting their name: with a rowdy boat parade.<br />In Wednesday’s nautical celebration, a flotilla of boats carried Tom Brady and his carousing teammates along the Hillsborough River near downtown Tampa to the city’s port. The procession resembled Tampa’s annual Gasparilla Pirate Festival commemorating the legendary pirate José Gaspar, known as “the Last of the Buccaneers.”<br />The team’s name brings to mind romantic images of swashbucklers on the high seas. But the origins of the term go back to hunters grilling the meat of wild animals in the Caribbean.<br />When Europeans began colonizing Latin America, they incorporated many indigenous practices. One was slow-roasting meat over a fire using a wooden framework. In Taíno, spoken on several Caribbean islands, this cooking method was called “barbacoa,” which was borrowed into Spanish and eventually gave rise to the English word “barbecue.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration says it won’t be ending tariffs on imported European wine, cheese and other food imports any time soon—to the dismay of industry groups who say the levies are hurting U.S. restaurants and consumers.<br />The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Friday it was unnecessary for now to suspend the levies, which were imposed by the Trump administration as part of a longstanding dispute with the European Union over commercial aircraft subsidies.<br />In a regulatory filing, the USTR said it would “continue to consider the action taken in the investigation,” referring to a 17-year-old dispute over how governments subsidize  Boeing Co.  and  Airbus SE .  The Biden administration has said it is reviewing the tariffs and other major trade policy actions adopted by the previous administration.<br />Under the Trump administration, the dispute turned into a tariff fight that snared food and beverage industries unrelated to aircraft manufacturing. Washington imposed tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European wine and food items like cheese and olives in late 2019.<br />The European Union hit back with levies on U.S. whiskey, nuts and tobacco valued around $4.5 billion. The U.S. stepped up the sanctions on Dec. 31 with additional tariffs, placing virtually all wine imports from France and Germany under its 25% tariff.</td>

      <td>BEIJING—Chinese authorities refused to provide World Health Organization investigators with raw, personalized data on early Covid-19 cases that could help them determine how and when the coronavirus first began to spread in China, according to WHO investigators who described heated exchanges over the lack of detail.<br />The Chinese authorities turned down requests to provide such data on 174 cases of Covid-19 that they have identified from the early phase of the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. The investigators are part of a WHO team that this week completed a monthlong mission in China aimed at determining the origins of the pandemic.<br />Chinese officials and scientists provided their own extensive summaries and analysis of data on the cases, said the WHO team members. They also supplied aggregated data and analysis on retrospective searches through medical records in the months before the Wuhan outbreak was identified, saying that they had found no evidence of the virus.<br />But the WHO team wasn’t allowed to view the raw underlying data on those retrospective studies, which could allow them to conduct their own analysis on how early and how extensively the virus began to spread in China, the team members said. Member states typically provide such data—anonymized, but disaggregated so investigators can see all other relevant details on each case—as part of WHO investigations, said team members.<br />“They showed us a couple of examples, but that’s not the same as doing all of them, which is standard epidemiological investigation,” said Dominic Dwyer, an Australian microbiologist on the WHO team. “So then, you know, the interpretation of that data becomes more limited from our point of view, although the other side might see it as being quite good.”</td>

The Cuomo administration released a partial transcript of the meeting on Friday.<br />“We froze,” Melissa DeRosa, the governor’s secretary, said according to the transcript. “We were in a position where we weren’t sure if what we were going to give to the Department of Justice or what we give to you guys and what we start saying was going to be used against us and we weren’t sure if there was going to be an investigation.”<br />Republicans said Ms. DeRosa’s statements were an admission that the governor was purposefully covering up the administration’s actions, and reiterated calls for an independent probe.</td>

      <td>After decades in an industry obsessed with youth, the designer writes in her new book that ‘you can feel better and be better with age’</td>
      <td>Norma Kamali was 29 in 1975 when she left her husband of 10 years and the fashion company they had built together. On her own, she had $98, a small Manhattan apartment with a mattress, and her self-esteem, which was fragile but intact. She loved designing clothing but had no idea how to run a business.<br />“I was in a really bad situation,” Ms. Kamali says. She usually kept her problems to herself, but her story tumbled out in a meeting with a Los Angeles Times fashion editor, who swiftly arranged a loan of some sewing machines. “I started to realize that communication is everything,” Ms. Kamali, 75, says over Zoom from her company’s headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. “If people believe in you, they can actually help.”<br />Ms. Kamali borrowed money from friends and family to launch a new business in 1976 called OMO (“On My Own”) Norma Kamali. That same year, Farrah Fawcett wore a red swimsuit designed by Ms. Kamali in an iconic photograph. (The suit is now part of the Smithsonian collection.) Christie Brinkley made famous another Kamali swimsuit—a high-cut, lavender bikini—on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine the following year. By 1980, when her pioneering designs for chic clothes made from sweatshirt material had department-store shoppers lining up around the block, Ms. Kamali had little trouble paying back her creditors.<br />Looking back, Ms. Kamali admits to learning some lessons the hard way. Among the most valuable, she says, was the decision to set off on her own. “Walking away is one of the most important things I’ve learned in my life,” she writes in her new book, “I Am Invincible,” which she calls “a handbook on aging with power.” Leaving a relationship or a business deal is never easy, she notes. But in situations that threaten your soul or your integrity, walking away “signifies being in control and aware of your worth.”<br />As the sole owner and designer of her eponymous company for 45 years, Ms. Kamali has earned an ardent following for her ingenuity and longevity. Designs that she conceived decades ago, such as her early swimsuits and her stylishly warm sleeping bag coat, remain bestsellers, even as editors praise her latest collections as among her best to date. In an industry known for ephemerality, Ms. Kamali has a rare knack for staying relevant. Her modish, user-friendly designs have kept her factories humming through the pandemic, which lends further credence to a book filled with her advice.</td>

      <td>Turkey’s most hypnotic city isn’t as inaccessible as you think. You can teleport yourself there anytime with these TV shows, films, dishes, books and at least one psychedelic rock ’n’ roll band.</td>
      <td>FOR MOST AMERICAN visitors, Turkey’s biggest city is familiar and surprising at the same time. Stroll the streets of Istanbul and you’ll find Apple Stores, Shake Shacks and chic, hijab-covered women Rollerblading along the seaside, all against an age-old soundtrack—the call to prayer streaming through the speakers of the city’s countless mosques. It’s not so much about East meeting West; Istanbul’s cultural abundance makes those very categories feel obsolete. The city’s innumerable attractions—the Ottoman-era palaces, the sumptuous art museums, the sensational food and shopping—all make it a magnetic destination. For intrepid travelers, Istanbul is still a top temptation given that Turkey is one of the few countries that currently allows U.S. tourists. Americans are welcome as long as they show proof of a negative Covid-19 test (though the CDC still deems Turkey, as well as most of Europe, highly risky in terms of the virus). But like a lot of places right now, Istanbul lacks its usual swagger. For the last two months, this city of 16 million falls silent every weekday at 9 p.m. under a strictly enforced curfew. On weekends, residents can leave their homes only for grocery shopping. Restaurants are open just for takeout or delivery during the week, and only delivery on weekends. Tourists are exempt from curfews, and hotel restaurants can serve meals to guests, but the streets empty of locals can feel ghostly. Until those streets fill up again, you may prefer to explore the city another way—by sampling some of the music, movies, books and tastes that will surely make you want to visit in the flesh just as soon as the time is right.<br />In this lyrical memoir, Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk recounts his childhood growing up in a well-to-do household. He intersperses his personal experiences with historical accounts of Istanbul by noted visitors, including Gustave Flaubert, using his reflections on various sites and neighborhoods to examine not only his own identity as a writer but how Istanbulites see themselves and their place in the world.<br />A 2018 Pulitzer Prize finalist for nonfiction, Hansen’s book is primarily a study of the impact of American policies and actions in the Middle East. But the chapters set in Istanbul also vividly capture the intelligence, color and humor of the people she encounters. For an armchair traveler, it’s the next best thing to meeting locals in person.<br />The main sleuth in this breezy Istanbul-based mystery—the fourth and most recent of Mehmet Murat Somer’s popular Turkish Delight series—is Burçak Veral, a transvestite who dresses like Audrey Hepburn. She also serves as a highly entertaining and food-obsessed tour guide to the city.<br />If you want to try preparing Turkish dishes at home, “The Turkish Cookbook,” by Musa Dagdeviren covers the broad range of Turkey’s cuisine. Mr. Dagdeviren spent years travelling the country to preserve regional recipes, a journey also chronicled on  Netflix ’s  “Chef’s Table” series. Here are three local specialties recommended by Mr. Dagdeviren, each one a culinary history lesson.</td>

His largest single holding was between $25 million and $50 million in Vanguard’s Total Stock Market ETF.<br />Presidential nominees disclose their assets and incomes in ranges. The Journal received Mr. Gensler’s form, which he signed on Jan. 18 and was completed by the OGE on Feb. 4, on Friday.<br />Mr. Gensler’s income was between $1.07 million and $5.14 million during the reporting period, which encompasses 2020 and the first 18 days of 2021. Most of his earnings were investment income. He was also paid $315,275 for his role as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he has taught courses on blockchain and cryptocurrency since 2018.<br />The only individual stock Mr. Gensler owned during the reporting period was  Tesla Inc.  He sold an undisclosed number of Tesla shares for a capital gain of between $50,000 and $100,000.</td>

      <td>Silence on human-rights issues risks alienating U.S. consumers; speaking up could earn the host nation’s ire</td>
      <td>On the evening of Feb. 4, 2022, an opening ceremony in Beijing is scheduled to kick off the Winter Olympics, the second time in 14 years the Games will be held in China. But more than medals will be on the line. The 2022 Games highlight a dilemma facing potential sponsors: Risk association with an authoritarian regime, or forgo a much-needed chance at a star turn on the global stage?<br />Major companies are eager to get in on the action.  Visa Inc.,  Coca-Cola Co. and a host of other businesses will be represented in Beijing as “Olympic Partners,” the highest level of sponsorship available, a tier that covers several Games cycles and is reserved for those writing the biggest checks and launching the most aggressive tie-in marketing campaigns. Mars-Wrigley will be there, too, handing out Snickers, “the official chocolate of the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games.”<br />What might have seemed like a no-brainer—backing a popular sporting event in a country with 1.4 billion consumers—may turn out to be a high-risk gamble. The Olympics could mark the crescendo of a yearslong trend of some consumers, advocates and Western lawmakers pointing out what they consider the true costs of working with a country where horrifying human-rights abuses have been cataloged by journalists and U.S. officials. At a time when global companies rely more heavily than ever on the Chinese market, its government has proven easily triggered by the slightest criticism—and unafraid to exact economic punishment on those who cross it politically.<br />Already advocates are asking  Airbnb Inc.,  another Olympic Partner, why its lodging is available in a country where Uighurs in the province of Xinjiang are housed in concentration camps, subjected to forced labor and other abuses.<br />Airbnb is one of many companies that tout themselves as corporate models of social responsibility, highlighting volunteer programs and nonprofit outreach in ways that are increasingly a consideration for consumers deciding how and where to spend their money. When it comes to China, such activists say, the company appears to be less concerned.</td>

      <td>“I think we’re a bit outnumbered, but we’re here.” So said one commenter on a Reddit thread about whether women joined in the recent WallStreetBets trading frenzy.<br />Female investors largely sat out the riskiest punts taken on stocks like GameStop. That may be no bad thing considering the videogame retailer’s stock is down over 80% from its late-January peak. But low female participation in stock-market investing more generally is a problem, for women and the finance industry alike.<br />Less than one-quarter of deposits into U.S. brokerage accounts were made by women in January, according to consumer-spending data analytics firm Cardify. Globally, the situation may be even worse: Israel-based brokerage eToro said that female investors make up just 14% of its registered users, most of whom are in the U.S. and Europe.<br />Some trading platforms did a good job of signing up women during the pandemic. Just over a third of Robinhood users were female at the beginning of this year, up from 20.5% a year before, according to Cardify. For the finance industry as a whole, though, attracting more female custom remains a frustratingly slow work in progress.<br />Women tend to be more conservative investors than men, preferring to put their wealth into real estate, cash or bonds while steering clear of equities.  Credit Suisse  surveyed a sample of existing clients and found that almost half of its female customers have 90% of their wealth tied up in low-yielding cash and fixed income—well over double the exposure the Swiss bank recommends.</td>

      <td>One of the Civil War’s bloodiest episodes left a lasting imprint on those who fought—and many who didn’t.</td>
      <td>“The real war will never get in the books.” Walt Whitman’s well-known prediction has not prevented thousands of writers, including Whitman himself, from trying to put the Civil War between covers. Many kinds of chronicles have been written—military histories, political studies, overviews of society or culture, portraits of leading figures. One especially striking way of bringing the war alive is to convey it from the standpoint of the unexalted individual. That is the choice John Matteson makes in “A Worse Place Than Hell,” a moving group portrait that uses the Battle of Fredericksburg, in late 1862, as the focal point for the story of five participants in the Civil War, four Northerners and one Southerner.<br />The battle that Mr. Matteson highlights has attracted a lot of scrutiny over the years, most notably in Francis Augustín O’Reilly’s “The Fredericksburg Campaign” (2003) and George C. Rable’s “Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg!” (2002). These books give details of the fateful encounter near the Rappahannock River on Dec. 13, 1862, in which Army of the Potomac under Ambrose E. Burnside met resounding defeat at the hands of Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. The futile assaults by waves of Union soldiers on Confederate troops, who were protected by a stone wall on Marye’s Heights, have become a fixture of Civil War lore. On that grim winter day, the Union suffered more than 12,000 casualties, compared with some 5,300 on the Confederate side. President Lincoln put a positive spin on the battle by praising the surviving Union soldiers for their bravery. Privately, however, he confessed that the battle had left him in “a worse place than hell.”<br />Although Mr. Matteson uses Lincoln’s phrase for his title, he doesn’t dwell on the hellish aspects of the war. Instead he concentrates on personal and cultural transformation. The people he follows were profoundly changed by the war, he tells us; all of them “confronted war and struggled to redeem themselves within it.” Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the son of a famous Boston physician and author, entered the war as an idealistic man and emerged from it hard-bitten and skeptical, leading him to seek direction in a legal career. The Rev. Arthur Fuller, the brother of the women’s rights champion Margaret Fuller, served as a chaplain in a Massachusetts regiment but at Fredericksburg traded his ministerial role for a military one, taking up a gun in a burst of patriotism and losing his life to Confederate bullets. The budding author Louisa May Alcott, hoping to contribute to the Northern cause, became a volunteer nurse in a Washington war hospital, an experience that fed into her popular book “Hospital Sketches” and later provided the emotional background for “Little Women,” a fictionalized portrayal of the Civil War’s toll on her Concord, Mass., family.<br />As for Walt Whitman, he was writing poems and newspaper stories in Brooklyn and hobnobbing with bohemians when he heard that his brother George had been wounded at Fredericksburg. He traveled first to Washington and then south to the environs of the battlefield in search of his brother, whose wound, as it turned out, was not serious. Walt stayed on for several years in Washington, taking on minor government jobs while serving as a volunteer nurse in war hospitals, setting the stage for his later role as the major poet and memoirist of the war. Two of Whitman’s poems about Lincoln, “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d” and “O Captain! My Captain!,” are timeless eulogies of America’s greatest president, and his writings about the war, in poetry and prose, are at once crisply realistic and emotionally resonant. George Whitman, Walt’s brother, ended up serving in many Civil War battles and thus provides, in Mr. Matteson’s narrative, a kind of moving lens on the war as it unfolded on the battlefield.<br />In addition to these Northerners, Mr. Matteson describes the dashing John Pelham, a Confederate artillery officer who exhibited unusual courage. At Fredericksburg, partly hidden by a dip in the land, Pelham coolly supervised the firing of a cannon that was protected by its very proximity to Union troops: Their return volleys mainly went over the heads of the rebels. Pelham’s death at the Battle of Kelly’s Ford, three months after Fredericksburg, becomes in Mr. Matteson’s handling a dramatic, hopeless flourish of Confederate chivalry. Pelham charged forward on a horse like a blond god of war before being felled by an enemy shell fragment. The loss of Pelham was a blow for Confederate morale. Mr. Matteson writes: “No individual in the Confederate Army had seemed more invincible than Pelham. His risks had never been punished, and his audacity had been continually rewarded. If he could fall, so, too, might the army he left behind.”</td>

      <td>Traveling the world, a writer looks for clues to the future in the urban world of the past.</td>
      <td>Do Americans like cities?<br />Small towns? Emphatically. Suburbs? Even more so, to judge from how many people live in them. A “li’l ol’ country place” is where Mr. Blandings builds if he can.<br />There are U.S. places where the values of old Europe abide: In New York, San Francisco, New Orleans, or Boston you get a sense that the citizens love the center and would live there if there were enough room for them all. In Italy, Spain and France, civic pride springs from ancient notions of the polis and aristocratic traditions of what makes an environment noble. But the U.S. owes a lot to England, where the cult of country life outscores urban priorities. The All-American protagonist of the old TV series “Green Acres” longed for Hooterville, while his Hungarian wife pined for Park Avenue. To EU eyes, most U.S. urban neighborhoods look extemporized, undignified, hastily weatherboarded and easy to vacate. Families don’t cling to home: The pursuit of happiness scatters them.<br />When the going gets tough, Americans abandon cities with astonishing alacrity. Hence the widely scattered ghost towns: the ill-tilled gardens of Detroit; the echoing sidewalks of Gary, Ind.; the half-vanished populations of Cleveland and Youngstown, Ohio; and, in Scranton, Penn., President Biden’s haggard hometown. When factories fall, rivers shrivel or mineral veins bleed out, people move on.<br />In “Four Lost Cities: A Secret History of the Urban Age,” science journalist and fiction writer Annalee Newitz, who is reluctant to let capital determine fate, wants people to choose where to live and how to work in the land of the free. The book wavers between rival explanations for writing about why people “lose” cities. Sometimes more reasons appear for choosing city life in the first place, or for why people put so much work into doomed structures. Much attention focuses laudably on retrieving residents’ lives from middens, graffiti, and the layout of sewers, or ruts in the roads; elsewhere, the author concentrates on the misdeeds of elites that make those lives intolerable. Early on, readers learn that the book was written in refuge from—perhaps expiation for—the suicide of the writer’s estranged father. The reaction seems unusual: Most people, according to their means, might erect a monument, endow a charity, or leave flowers. But the author is a journalist, and it is no sin to labor in one’s vocation.</td>

      <td>A Ming dynasty classic of action-packed hilarity gets a fresh translation.</td>
      <td>The books that Sinologists commonly refer to as the Four Great Classics of Chinese literature are the court romance “Dream of the Red Chamber,” the sprawling military chronicle “Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” the outlaw adventure “The Water Margin” and the supernatural quest fantasy “Journey to the West,” the last of which now appears in an abridged edition from Penguin Classics in a new translation and with a fittingly playful new title, “Monkey King” (339 pages, $30). Published during the Ming dynasty in 1592, “Monkey King” is the comic relief of the quartet, a rollicking work of high buffoonery whose stature in East Asian culture, according to translator Julia Lovell, “may be compared with that of The Canterbury Tales or Don Quixote in European letters.”<br />Authorship of “Monkey King” has been ascribed to a knockabout writer-for-hire named Wu Cheng’en (ca. 1506-1582), though Ms. Lovell notes that the attribution is at best an educated guess. The outline of the story is based on the journeys of a real figure, the seventh-century monk Xuanzang, who traveled from China to India in search of sacred Buddhist scriptures. But “Monkey King” travesties the typical pilgrimage narrative by laying its focus on Xuanzang’s chief disciple and bodyguard, a shape-shifting, smart-talking, excessively pugilistic primate.<br />Monkey King (who is given the name Sun Wukong) gains his otherworldly powers at the feet of great Buddhist masters, who teach him the Way of Immortality and the 72 Transformations. Thus equipped, he claims the audacious title “The Great Sage Equal to Heaven” and bullies his way into Heaven itself, where he makes no end of mischief for the Jade Emperor and his celestial consorts. Only Gautama Buddha is able to subdue the interloper (during their confrontation, Monkey King pees on the Enlightened One) and finally pins him beneath a mountain for 500 years.<br />This is classic fish-out-of-water comedy, and the Jade Emperor is disturbed less by Monkey King’s rampages than by the fact that his presence in such distinguished settings threatens to “erode hierarchy and order.” The jokes hit every register, from slapstick and toilet humor to dryly delivered drolleries: “Now we must remind you that the Great Sage Equal to Heaven was, when all was said and done,” the author adds, “still a monkey demon.”<br />The condition of Monkey King’s release is that he provide protection to Xuanzang on his long trip to India to bring back Buddhist texts “that can release mortals from vexations, calamities, and transgressions.” They’re joined by a pig-fiend called Pigsy and a river monster called Sandy, who, Lucifer-like, were also banished from Heaven for insubordination. The novel settles into an episodic structure, with each chapter centering on the many monsters and hostile kingdoms they encounter during their travels. There are instances of heroism and moral instruction—Monkey King’s arc is redemptive—but the form is essentially, as Ms. Lovell writes, that of “an action-packed situation comedy,” with recurring gags, ridiculous challenges to overcome and a lot of cheeky crosstalk. The literary analog for the gonzo humor is Rabelais and the fight scenes are the stuff of superhero comics. But the comparison that kept coming to my mind is with the irreverent, twinkling humor of Looney Tunes cartoons, with Monkey King a cross between Bugs Bunny and the Tasmanian Devil.</td>

      <td>If sex is among the most potent human drives, the deity who embodied it must have been a power player.</td>
      <td>Close your eyes and think of Venus. What image comes to mind? Perhaps Botticelli’s bored teenager in her scallop shell; maybe the Venus de Milo, serene, lovely and just a touch bovine; perhaps Titian’s meretricious “Venus of Urbino,” lying on her back caressing her genitals. At any rate, a ravishingly beautiful young woman, probably blond and almost certainly not wearing many clothes.<br />Bettany Hughes is out to convince you that the face of Venus familiar to us today—simultaneously salacious and saccharine—conceals a much darker and more complex character. The Roman goddess Venus, like her Greek counterpart Aphrodite, was “far more than just a gorgeous goddess of love”; in fact, Ms. Hughes argues, she wasn’t really interested in “love” at all, let alone beauty or romance. Aphrodite was a goddess of fierce and violent sexuality, the forceful tamer of men and beasts, the mother (by her lover Ares) of the lesser gods Dread and Fear. Divine patron of Valentine’s Day she was not.<br />Any children’s book about the Greeks or Romans will tell you that each god had his or her own special domain: Ares was “the god of war,” Hera was the “goddess of marriage,” and so on. There can be no doubt that sexual desire was central to the ancient “meaning” of Venus-Aphrodite. The Greeks called sex ta aphrodisia, “the works of Aphrodite” (whence the modern English “aphrodisiac”). The problem, as Ms. Hughes fully recognizes, is that Aphrodite was also the goddess of all sorts of other things. She presided over Greek civic magistrates, the unity of the citizen body, safe travel by sea, military leadership and the battle-rage of Greek warriors; on the eve of the Battle of Salamis in 480 B.C., Plutarch tells us, the women of Corinth prayed to Aphrodite to inspire their husbands with “passion for battle against the barbarians.”<br />There are two different ways of accounting for the breadth and messiness of Venus’s divine portfolio. One is to suppose that an “original” goddess of sexual desire picked up a set of random additional functions over time—what Robert Parker has neatly called the snowball theory of the Greek gods, “the idea that as a god rolls down through history it picks up new functions and powers that need not cohere with its original nature or with one another: rather like a multinational company that starts out selling records and ends up running an airline.”<br />In some ways, this theory works quite well for Venus-Aphrodite. The Greek Aphrodite, for all her associations with fertility and virility, was never seen as a mother-goddess. But in the first century B.C., as Ms. Hughes vividly describes, the Romans developed a major new cult of Venus Genetrix, “Venus the mother.” In this new incarnation, Venus was worshiped as the ancestor of Julius Caesar via the mythical hero Aeneas and his son Julius, and thus served as the mother-patron of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and the people of Rome more generally. This new aspect of Venus as an ancestor-mother is a classic example of the snowball in motion, a completely new set of associations bolted on to her “central” character as a goddess of violent sexuality.</td>

      <td>Selected by the author, most recently, of ’22 Minutes of Unconditional Love.’</td>
      <td>By Scott Spencer (1979)<br />1. Before Scott Spencer’s novel was made into not one but two cheesy movies, it began life as a remarkable, sexually explicit novel about youthful desire. David Axelrod, the book’s narrator, recounts the story of his wild if doomed passion for 16-year-old Jade Butterfield and his love for her unconventional family. Disaster follows when Jade’s father dictates that the young couple take a 30-day vacation from the affair—an order to which David responds by setting the Butterfields’ house on fire, driven by the belief that by putting out the fire and saving the Butterfields, he’ll be viewed as a hero. He is, to the contrary, committed to a mental institution. Years later, he’ll have a vision—a scene set in an empty theater in the middle of the night: “And now for this last time, Jade, I don’t mind, or even ask if it’s madness: I see your face, I see you, you; I see you in every seat.”<br />By Marguerite Duras (1984)<br />2. An autobiographical tale that begins in 1929, “The Lover” tells the story of a brief affair between an impoverished 15-year-old French girl living in colonial Saigon and a much older Chinese-Vietnamese financier. The girl is spellbound by her lover’s car and by the elegance of his clothes as well as his “English cigarettes.” Although she looks barely older than a child with her thin, undersize body, the man is clearly infatuated with her. She quickly recognizes her power: “From the first moment she knows more or less, knows he’s at her mercy.” She knows, as well, the intense pleasure she derives from this sexual union. It is an affair carried on in the face of social pressures—there are the matters of race and class to consider. All this is reflected in spare and eloquent prose, as Marguerite Duras looks back at her younger self and a wholly different world.<br />By Jenny Diski (1986)</td>

      <td>The threats to a culture’s collective memory can come from neglect—or more sinister forces.</td>
      <td>Why would an army target a university library with incendiary shells, leaving buildings around it intact? Why would an author choose to consign years of impassioned writing to the flames? The answer is simple. As an official in the British Empire once observed, while overseeing the purge of a colonial archive, “What’s burned won’t be missed.” Richard Ovenden, director of the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, is acutely aware of the many ways in which books and paper archives cease to exist: not only through deliberate destruction—acts of moral outrage, retribution, even efforts to literally erase history—but also simple neglect, perhaps a more sinister threat because it so often goes unnoticed. Fortunately, he has devoted a great deal of time to thinking about these disasters and how to prevent them. His compelling thoughts are now gathered in the eminently readable (and provocatively titled) “Burning the Books: A History of the Deliberate Destruction of Knowledge.”<br />Mr. Ovenden views himself as one in a line of librarians going back to the Bronze Age and to Apollonius of Rhodes at the library of Alexandria. He urges us to remember that “although the technologies of creating knowledge, and the techniques for preservation have altered radically, their core functions have changed surprisingly little.” Mr. Ovenden believes that what is handed down over time, from Alexandria to the Bodleian, is the “ethos that knowledge holds great power,” and that “its loss can be an early warning sign of a decaying civilisation.”<br />Mr. Ovenden begins at the beginning, with the library of Ashurbanipal, beneath the ruins of Nineveh, in modern-day Iraq, a city so ancient it was already long desolate when Greek warrior-historian Xenophon passed through over 2,000 years ago. In the 19th century, tens of thousands of tablets were unearthed at the site by British and French archaeologists (energetically pursuing their hereditary rivalry). The tablets recorded administrative and bureaucratic activity, as well as oracular queries and divination. The most celebrated ones hold the epic of Gilgamesh, among the world’s earliest works of literature. Although some of King Ashurbanipal’s library survived, much was burned and smashed by vengeful Medes and Babylonians generations after his reign had ended. As Mr. Ovenden points out, “the survival of the collections themselves is accidental.”<br />The most famous library to have disappeared is that of Alexandria, a towering structure, “said to contain a vast ocean of knowledge, razed to the ground in a fiery blaze.” Mr. Ovenden suggests that “in some ways the destruction of the library has become as important, if not more, to its legacy as its existence.” The fabled immolation is variously attributed to Caesar, a Christian patriarch, or a Muslim caliph who was said to have used the scrolls to heat his baths. It was Edward Gibbon, in his “Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,” who transformed the loss into such a potent symbol of barbarity, the violent disregard or even hatred of knowledge (Gibbon dismisses the tale of the caliph’s depredations). It is a peculiar paradox that the library of Alexandria symbolizes at once the urge to accumulate knowledge and the barbarous impulse to destroy it. The mundane truth is that the library likely dissolved slowly, “both through organisational neglect and through the gradual obsolescence of the papyrus scrolls themselves” rather than in a single great conflagration. “Alexandria is a cautionary tale of the danger of creeping decline.”<br />Nevertheless, “Burning the Books” is black with the ashes of libraries: Islamic “storehouses of knowledge” leveled by Mongol raiders in the 13th century; medieval scriptoria put to the torch by Vikings; monasteries dissolved under Henry VIII, when “tens of thousands of books were burned or broken up and sold as scrap.” Such despoliation led Sir Thomas Bodley to found his library at Oxford, hailed by Francis Bacon as “an ark to save learning from the deluge” (however, all but a handful of the books originally in his library were seized and wrecked by “Reformers”). The United States Library of Congress burned twice, once at the hands of a ruthless British army in 1814 and again, by accident, on Christmas Eve 1851. It is estimated that 100 million Jewish books were lost in the Holocaust. Half a century after V-E Day, Serbian militia shelled the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo, instructing their snipers to pick off librarians attempting to save books from the blaze.</td>

      <td>Visiting eras past through a vibrant graphic memoir and luminous picture books.</td>
      <td>Apart from dipping into our own memories, the closest that most of us will ever get to time travel is the recollections and stories of people who lived before us. For children of the present moment, four notable new books offer remembrances of things past.<br />The first is a delightful graphic-novel memoir of girlhood and artistic coming-of-age for children ages 8-14. Written and illustrated by Casablanca-born artist Sylvie Kantorovitz, who now lives in the United States, “Sylvie” (Walker, 346 pages, $24.99) begins in France. It is the mid-1960s, and, having left Morocco with their parents, little Sylvie and her even littler brother, Alibert, have the run of the small educational college where their father is principal. It’s an idyll for the children, with balustrades for balancing, tadpoles for catching and the thick roots of chestnut trees for clambering upon: “The challenge was to go around and around without ever touching the ground.”<br />Ms. Kantorovitz’s drawings exude benignity. Everyone in them has a sweet, sturdy appearance, with big round eyes and a total absence of neck; people may wear ties or necklaces or collared shirts, but there is no slender bit to be found. This makes us feel curiously fond of the characters, even when, as in the case of Sylvie’s parents, they are shouting at each other. Sylvie and Alibert fight, too; it is a stressful atmosphere for a girl who, we see, is not naturally drawn to conflict. Early on, Sylvie finds quiet joy in putting marks on paper; in a lovely sequence, she pores over encyclopedia entries and draws from them in a little storage room behind her father’s office. Her father is something of a dreamer himself. Unlike his exacting and exasperated wife, who wants to see Sylvie score impressive grades in the hard-science subjects that other people esteem, he supports their daughter’s artistic impulses.<br />The portrait that the modern child encounters in this illustrated autobiography is enviable, really, even if in the author’s life, as in every life, a little rain does fall. In addition to having quarreling parents, she’s marked out by her peers for her North African birth and Jewish heritage; then there’s the extra housework when a second set of siblings comes along. Children of gentle and artistic temperament will find a kindred spirit in Sylvie Kantorovitz and perhaps take encouragement for their own moments of travail and independence.<br />Peter Sís, who chronicled Cold War life on the far side of the Iron Curtain in his 2007 picture book “The Wall,” goes a bit further back in time with a true story of wartime heroism in “Nicky & Vera” (Norton Young Readers, 62 pages, $19.95). In this luminous picture book for children ages 5 to 10, “Nicky” is Nicholas Winton, a British stockbroker who skipped a planned skiing holiday in 1938 to meet a friend in Prague. The city was flooded with refugees fleeing Nazi Germany’s invasion of the Sudetenland. In short order, Nicky threw himself into the work of finding temporary foster homes for Czech children in Britain. The “Vera” of the book’s title, meanwhile, is Veruska Diamantova, whose happy childhood in a small town outside Prague ended in separation from her parents and safe passage (thanks to Nicky) on a train bound for the U.K.</td>

      <td>The color of Tom Williams’s skin made him a target, even as a national antiracism movement grew.</td>
      <td>Alex Tresniowski, the author of “The Rope: A True Story of Murder, Heroism, and the Dawn of the NAACP,” tells us at the book’s outset that “the story of Tom Williams is also the story of two individuals, a man and a woman, one white, one black, born at different times in different parts of the country, fated never to meet but linked by a passion for justice, and by a single legal case in a town called Asbury Park.”<br />Mr. Tresniowski then sets us in that New Jersey township, in November 1910. He introduces us to Williams, who lives there, “but only in the shadows of other people’s lives, a peripheral figure, a black man for hire, no one of note. This was how both he and the city wanted it.”<br />Williams, a onetime amateur boxer who went by the name Black Diamond, knows to keep his head down; knows that it would never be a fair fight should he get on the wrong side of the law; knows that “black codes, Jim Crow, disenfranchisement, segregation, lynching” are “insidious, suppressive, and terrorizing.” That terror could ignite immediately, as it does after a 10-year-old white girl named Marie Smith goes missing while walking home from school. Mr. Tresniowski, a journalist and prolific author of human-interest and true-crime books, shows us through brisk and cinematic writing the horror confronted by Marie’s parents—her mother running from their home to the schoolhouse, her father searching by lantern, in vain, under every tree and bush. There is no sign to be found of the “sunny child” who left for school wearing a blue satin ribbon in her hair.<br />While no evidence points to Williams, the public nevertheless demands a villain. Williams is arrested and jailed. A local newspaper fans the flames of civic outrage with large-type headlines such as, “NEGRO IS PLACED AT SCENE AT THE TIME OF BRUTAL MURDER.” Asbury Park is susceptible to such outrage, having been founded several decades earlier as a resort for white people. The black hotel and service workers who walk its boardwalks are considered, as reported by the New York Times, to be “intruding themselves in places where common sense should tell them not to go.”<br />The white people who march to the jail where Williams is held yell “Diamond will never leave this town alive!” and “Lynch him!” Mr. Tresniowski tells us that en route they broke into a stonemason’s store, emerging “with an arsenal—a twenty-pound sledgehammer, a long pinch bar, a steel crowbar, an ax, an iron roller.” These instruments of torture, wielded by white mobs, appear again and again in “The Rope” as the author recounts stories of other lynchings in other cities, scenes of such savagery it is terrible to know that humans harbor this capacity. And yet they are more than capable: They are eager to see the entrails of entirely innocent men smeared in the streets, to set men on fire, to hang them from trees as a warning to others, to give action to spasms of hate and destroy the rights and progress made by black Americans after the Civil War.</td>

      <td>In a tale of goddesses and witches wronged, the mother of monsters gets her say.</td>
      <td>Old Norse mythology is familiar enough today that most everyone has heard of Thor and Odin, Ragnarok and Valhalla. Two lesser-known Norse figures form the core of “The Witch’s Heart” (Ace, 259 pages, $26), a debut novel from Genevieve Gornichec.<br />One is Angrboda, “proclaimer of sorrows,” the mother of three monstrous children: the great wolf Fenrir; the world-encircling Midgard Serpent, known as Jormungand; and the goddess Hel, ruler of the gloomy underworld of the same name. All of them were fathered, as we might have guessed, by the trickster god Loki.<br />Ms. Gornichec begins by identifying Angrboda with the even more mysterious Gullveig, the witch who helped spark the Aesir-Vanir War between two rival groups of gods. The Aesir stabbed and burned her three times, but thrice she came back. The Elder Edda, a poetic compendium of Norse myth, says disapprovingly: “She was always a delight to wicked women.”<br />That’s the official version, ripe for contradiction, and Ms. Gornichec folds Gullveig’s backstory into Angrboda’s, creating a composite figure of resistance to the gods’ patriarchy. She lives in hiding in Ironwood Forest at the edge of the world, befriended by Gerd (the wife of Frey) and Skadi (the huntress goddess). Both of her friends have a grudge against the patriarchs as well, Gerd because of her forced marriage, Skadi because of her father’s murder and the trick played on her when she claimed compensation. The wronged women have their own cards to play—including the monstrous births which will doom the gods at the end times of Ragnarok.<br />There are more domestic issues facing Gullveig/Angrboda as well. Is Loki’s aim to seduce her only to desert her? And how will she get on with Sigyn, Loki’s official wife, who in the end sits by her chained husband holding a bowl to catch the snake venom that would otherwise drip eternally on his face? Ms. Gornichec writes a series of almost-comic scenes, as mother and father bicker over child care and choice of names. Mother insists: “We are not calling our son ‘awesomely powerful magical stick,’ ” i.e., Jormungand. (That, of course, was Loki’s idea.)</td>

Researchers at the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, a University of Chicago institute that looked at a larger group of arrestees that included local charges, found that 10% had known affiliations with such groups.<br />Federal authorities have said the Proud Boys and other extremist groups played a key role in the Capitol riot, but the breach would have been impossible without the larger mob, said Robert Pape, a political-science professor and founder of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats.<br />“What made it overwhelming is this mass surge into the Capitol of the 90% that are not part of organized militias,” Mr. Pape said.</td>

      <td>With many Americans still housebound, we asked major paint brands which interior shades have been experiencing the biggest growth in sales. Their answers included a surprise or two.</td>
      <td>WHEN WILLIE NELSON wrote, “Hello, Walls,” a massive country-music hit for Faron Young in 1961, he surely didn’t foresee a time when virus-spooked Americans would sequester themselves at home for months at a stretch. “I’ll bet you dread to spend / Another lonely night with me,” Mr. Nelson penned of his walls.<br />These days, of course, we’re all staring at our walls a lot. And our collective edginess seems to have affected our decision-making when it comes to choosing colors to paint them. According to Sue Wadden, director of color marketing at Sherwin-Williams, the brand has been seeing strong sales growth for certain greens and blues. This isn’t entirely unpredictable, she said: Gentle shades associated with nature make us “feel grounded and connected to the space around [us]” when our lives are so uncertain.<br />Makes sense, right? But how to explain another pandemic-fueled paint-trend: a clamoring for black, as reported by a number of paint-manufacturer representatives we interviewed. While black’s growing popularity as an interior paint color might suggest that we’re mired in depression, Patrick O’Donnell, international brand ambassador at Farrow & Ball, sees it differently. While “most of us perceive black as intimidating and difficult to use,” he said, thoughtful applications of black can be soothing, especially in home offices. Farrow & Ball’s data suggests that customers are particularly responding to “more nuanced versions,” such as blueish noirs, instead of pure black. Another possible attraction? Black’s ability to complement another big pandemic trend: house plants. “Black is also a fantastic foil to planting,” Mr. O’Donnell said, “and verdant greens will really pop against this saturated backdrop.”<br />Here, five shades that saw particularly notable jumps in popularity over the past year.<br />“Black can—if used judiciously—create surprisingly calming atmospheres,” said Mr. O’Donnell at Farrow & Ball, which saw black paints, such as Farrow & Ball Off-Black No. 57, which skews a bit blue, spike in sales. Mr. O’Donnell noted black’s potential for turning a light-starved room into a cocoon, and for aiding focus of the mind in a home office, “where they are non-distracting.” From $110 a gallon, farrow-ball.com</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to wield the department’s broad powers to tackle potential risks to the financial system posed by climate change while pushing tax incentives to reduce carbon emissions.<br />Ms. Yellen is looking to a veteran of the Obama administration, Sarah Bloom Raskin, as the leading candidate for a new senior position that would head a new Treasury climate “hub,” according to people familiar with the matter. A former deputy Treasury secretary who once worked alongside Ms. Yellen on the Federal Reserve Board, Ms. Raskin has warned in interviews and speeches that U.S. regulators must do more to strengthen the financial system’s resilience to climate risks.<br />The move is part of the Biden administration’s effort across many government departments to address climate change and its impact on various industries. In two early moves, the administration rejoined the Paris climate accord and suspended new oil and gas leases on federal land.<br />“I think we need to seriously look at assessing the risk to the financial system from climate change,” Ms. Yellen said at her Senate confirmation hearing last month, calling it an “existential threat” to the U.S. economy. Ms. Yellen said the new hub would review financial stability risks and tax policy incentives related to climate change.<br />Her climate push is already facing resistance from some Republicans in Congress and financial industry officials wary of new regulatory burdens on banks after the Obama administration imposed widespread new rules following the 2008 financial crisis.</td>

President Biden, during his campaign, expressed support for government-sponsored savings programs for the estimated one-third of private-sector workers who lack access to a workplace retirement-savings plan.<br />Currently, three states—California, Oregon and Illinois—are enrolling workers in such plans. Other states, including New Jersey, Maryland, Colorado and Connecticut, are developing similar programs.<br />Mr. Scott said the Biden administration might ultimately decide to back a nationwide retirement-savings program for those without such plans at work. “It just depends on their priorities,” he said.</td>

Since their nadir in March last year, platinum prices have more than doubled.<br />Money managers have started pouring funds into platinum, in part because the metal is seen as a store of value at a time when investors expect government spending to lift inflation. Precious metals are often viewed as a hedge against rising consumer prices. After a run-up in the price of gold last year, some investors have turned to platinum as a cheaper alternative.<br />“It’s a well-kicked dog that’s getting up,” said R. Michael Jones, chief executive of Platinum Group Metals Ltd., which is developing a palladium, rhodium and platinum mine in South Africa.<br />Platinum’s comeback initially kicked off with a rebound in industrial consumption of precious metals. It has now been caught up in a broader surge across asset classes, powered by investors who are piling into rising markets in the expectation of further gains.</td>

      <td>Let the weather and the world do their worst. Made from scratch or from a packet, hot chocolate is always there for us. These are the ones to make and the ones to buy.</td>
      <td>THIS TIME OF year, no one needs to be reminded that they like hot chocolate—that it’s good, that it’s the antidote to the cold and the general dreariness that can permeate life come deep winter. But as we drag ourselves into pandemic year two, small comforts have assumed outsize importance. What else explains the insane viral sensation of hot chocolate bombs from a few months ago? This winter, not only do we like hot chocolate; we need it.<br />It’s an instant pick me up. It’s a chocolate bar that does not need to be chewed, just poured down your throat, warming your esophagus, your belly and, ultimately, your soul. This soothing drink is exactly the kind of harmless sedative America needs right now, the ultimate expression of self-love—or, at least, self-mercy.<br />Hot chocolate bombs aside, this winter, even regular old drinking chocolate has been a hot commodity. Matthew Caputo, co-owner of A Priori Chocolate, a Utah-based importer and distributor of dozens of craft chocolate brands, said that sales of drinking chocolates have gone up at least five times from past winters, and manufacturers are having difficulty keeping up with demand. Mr. Caputo attributed it in part to all the outdoor gatherings and activities that have extended well beyond their usual season. When we’re chilly, hot chocolate is what we crave.<br />It’s practically programmed in our DNA. Long before humans were eating chocolate, we were drinking it. “If the history of chocolate were a 24-hour cycle, glossy chocolate bars and confections would represent a few seconds,” writes chocolate and cacao scholar Maricel Presilla in “The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets.” “Cacao and chocolate beverages would account for the vast majority of a long saga that began in South America 56 centuries ago, at least 1,670 years before the Egyptians built their first step pyramid.”<br />After all this time, the love affair with drinking chocolate is going strong. In New York City, frigid temperatures and closed indoor dining did not deter customers from lining up outside the first U.S. location of Angelina, which opened last November, for a taste of the Parisian café’s famously thick chocolat chaud. “We see it all day long,” said Anthony Battaglia, Angelina’s chief operations officer. “We are selling up to 80 liters of hot chocolate a day. Our hot chocolate machine is working from 5 a.m. to 9 at night non-stop producing, producing, producing.” Due to unexpectedly high sales, the New York location had to send for reinforcements of branded disposable cups from the Paris mothership.</td>

Gun policy wasn’t part of his first round of executive orders, but advocacy groups said they were encouraged by White House outreach so far.<br />Domestic policy adviser Susan Rice and White House public engagement director Cedric Richmond met virtually with gun-control groups Wednesday, stressing their commitment to taking what they called “common-sense steps.” Activists are pushing for legislative moves, including an expanded background check bill, as well as items the president could pursue without the closely divided Congress, including appointing a senior aide tasked with gun-policy oversight and pursuing stricter enforcement of existing rules.<br />“I get it. Covid should be the top priority—one through 10,” said Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jamie, was killed in the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead and another 17 wounded.<br />Mr. Guttenberg was part of a call Thursday with Ms. Rice and Mr. Richmond and other Parkland families.

Latin America suffered challenges due to Covid, although Oyo’s business model is still “viable long-term,” Oyo Brazil said in an announcement Thursday.<br />in September of last year Oyo passed control of its Latin American operations to SoftBank, which was slated to invest $75 million into the unit. When Oyo decided to put less focus on the region, the pair decided that SoftBank would pull out of operations there and dismiss most of the staff on the ground, according to the Oyo Brazil announcement and an Oyo spokeswoman.<br />Oyo will continue to have a small local support crew in Latin America, and the brand will remain, but the company will provide the bulk of its services via software and technology platforms run out of other locations, said an Oyo spokeswoman. The company declined to say how many people are employed in Latin America now.</td>

      <td>Former ECB chief unites Italy’s fragmented political landscape</td>
      <td>ROME—Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, is set to be named Italian prime minister after persuading nearly all of the country’s squabbling parties to support his government, raising hopes that he can succeed where many others have failed: in leading Italy out of its deep economic malaise.<br />Italy’s head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, is expected to appoint Mr. Draghi and his proposed ministers later Friday or Saturday, ahead of a formal swearing-in at the weekend and a parliamentary vote of confidence early next week.<br />Mr. Draghi is set to take over Italy, the European Union’s third-biggest economy after Germany and France, at a time when it is fighting with persistently high Covid-19 contagion, an agonizingly slow vaccine rollout and restrictions on daily life that are holding the economy in recession.<br />Reviving economic growth in Italy is vital for the EU and its common currency, the euro, since Italy’s deep debts and chronically low growth are the biggest sources of doubt about the euro’s long-term stability. How to reanimate Italy’s economy, which has stagnated since the 1990s, has bedeviled a series of would-be reforming leaders who briefly carried the country’s hopes but ended as disappointments.<br />Mr. Draghi, a 73-year-old, U.S.-trained economist who has worked at the World Bank,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and Italy’s Treasury and central bank, will have at most two years to make a difference. Italian parties will return to competing for power in parliamentary elections by 2023 at the latest.</td>

      <td>On some days, more than half of shares changing hands in U.S. are traded outside public stock exchanges</td>
      <td>The stock market is going dark thanks to a boom in activity by individual investors and manic trading in stocks such as  GameStop Corp.<br />A record 47.2% of U.S. equity trading volume in January was executed outside public stock exchanges, up from 39.9% a year earlier, according to data from Rosenblatt Securities, a brokerage firm.<br />Before 2020, the percentage of what is known as dark trading had hovered just below 40% for years. Now, on some days, more than half the shares that change hands in the U.S. are traded on various off-exchange platforms. That happened for the first time on Dec. 23, three times in January, and again on Tuesday, when off-exchange volume hit 50.5%, an all-time high for a single day of trading, Rosenblatt data show.<br />Behind the shift is the influx of small investors, many of whom have been empowered by zero-commission trading apps and are stuck at home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Online brokerages that cater to individual investors, including Robinhood Markets Inc., send many of their customers’ orders to electronic trading firms such as Citadel Securities and  Virtu Financial Inc.  These firms typically execute small investors’ orders privately instead of routing them to public markets including the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market. The investors often get slightly better price terms from Citadel Securities and Virtu than they would if their orders were sent to exchanges.<br />Some analysts worry that the shift away from on-exchange trading could erode transparency. When fewer trades take place on exchanges, there is less information publicly available about the prices that investors are willing to pay for shares. That raises the risk that traders will pay more when buying and get less when selling than they should.</td>

But there is no similar protection for retirement accounts, where many people have saved a lot more money than in bank accounts.<br />When it comes to theft from retirement accounts, 401(k) record-keepers say family members are often the perpetrators. But about three years ago, the industry noticed a rise in online theft from such accounts by strangers, said Tim Rouse, executive director of Spark Institute Inc., which represents the retirement industry. “That set off huge alarms,” he said.<br />Recent court cases, in which hundreds of thousands of dollars were allegedly stolen from three people in separate 401(k) plans, highlight the risks to workers and retirees. While record-keepers generally promise to reimburse consumers for such losses, there are no guarantees.<br />“Cyber theft from retirement accounts is a growing concern,” said Steven Silberstein, chief executive of the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which combats cyber fraud in the finance industry. With more than $20 trillion in individual retirement accounts and 401(k)-type plans, they “are relatively high-value targets,” he said.</td>

      <td>Internal Revenue Service has seen inflation-adjusted funding drop by over 20% since 2010</td>
      <td>CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS’ RESCUE PACKAGE, including a major expansion of the child tax credit, has the potential to cut child poverty in half, according to Columbia University researchers, and begin building an economic and social policy legacy for President Biden. But it has a side benefit that Democrats plan to build on in subsequent legislation: It provides the first major funding boost likely to be made permanent to the Internal Revenue Service in over a decade.<br />The CTC plan to provide a $250-$300 per child monthly benefit to families comes with a nearly $400 million one-year bump to IRS funding, ostensibly to ease the administrative burden of a major new program. It’s the first step by Democrats to revive the beleaguered IRS, which has seen inflation-adjusted funding drop by over 20% since 2010 and the elimination of over 22% of its staff. Funding and staff for enforcement activities has dropped by around 30% over the last decade, per the Congressional Budget Office. There have been previous pots of money for handling Covid-19 stimulus payments and would be again in this legislation, but those aren’t likely to be renewed, like the money for the CTC administration.<br />Democrats have seized on those figures and projections from former officials to argue that funding the IRS, particularly for enforcement, is cost-effective: According to a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report, the IRS failed to collect from around 900,000 high-income individuals who didn’t file tax returns over a three-year period, which could have resulted in nearly $46 billion in tax payments. Biden is expected to call for more money for tax enforcement in his second economic package.<br />Over the years, Republicans have called for cutting IRS funding for several reasons, including a controversy over inquiries into conservative nonprofits and the IRS’s role in administering the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans, like Sen. Mitt Romney, support an expanded child tax credit but are unlikely to support Democrats’ version.<br />FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP’S TWEETS  between Election Day and Jan. 8, when he was permanently suspended from Twitter due to the “risk of further incitement,” were overwhelmingly about challenging the election results, according to a new analysis by Issue One, a nonprofit that advocates reducing the role of money in politics. Trump sent more than 1500 tweets during that period, of which 60% focused on challenging the election results. Trump said the election was “rigged” 57 times, called it a “steal” or “stolen” another 57 times, and declared he “won” 25 times.  Twitter  flagged over 25% of Trump’s tweets before banning him.</td>

His lawyers are expected to also argue that the former president was exercising his First Amendment rights, not encouraging violence, when he urged his supporters to “fight” and march to the Capitol in his speech preceding the riot.<br />Mr. Trump’s lawyers are also expected to criticize Democrats’ handling of the impeachment process in the House, arguing that they deprived him of due process, including representation during those proceedings. His defense team has argued that it is unconstitutional to try a former president in the Senate, an argument that all Republican senators but six agreed with in a vote earlier this week.<br />The defense team is likely to air footage of Democrats using fiery political language as it focuses on its First Amendment defense, a person familiar with the strategy said.<br />Mr. Trump’s defense team, like the House impeachment managers, has 16 hours allotted to make its case. On Thursday, Trump adviser Jason Miller said the team plans to only use one of their two days.

      <td>LONDON—The U.K. economy recorded its biggest contraction in more than three centuries in 2020, according to official estimates, highlighting the Covid-19 pandemic’s economic toll on a country that has also suffered one of the world’s deadliest outbreaks.<br />Though the country is grappling with a new, highly contagious variant of the coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hopeful that a rapid vaccination drive will permit a gradual reopening of the economy in the coming months, paving the way for a rapid rebound later in the year.<br />Gross domestic product shrank 9.9% over the year as a whole, the Office for National Statistics said Friday, the largest decline among the Group of Seven advanced economies. France’s economy shrank 8.3% and Italy’s contracted 8.8%, according to provisional estimates. German GDP declined 5%.<br />The decline in U.K. GDP in 2020 was the largest in more than 300 years, according to Bank of England data, though the preliminary estimate is likely to be revised. BOE data shows the economy last recorded a comparable drop in 1921, when it shrank 9.7% during the depression that followed World War I. The economy recorded a bigger contraction, of 13%, in 1709, during an unusually cold winter known as the Great Frost.<br />Britain’s economy was hit especially hard in the second quarter of the year as a nationwide lockdown took effect. Social distancing and the closure of restaurants, bars, hotels and theaters was painful for the British economy, where a higher share of national income is spent on recreation and similar services that require face-to-face contact than in other comparable economies.</td>

Kentucky, Arkansas, and Nebraska are among 12 states that received federal approval under the Trump administration to impose work requirements, although some plans were blocked by the courts.

One man shown on a video stream said: “Our president wants us here. We wait and take orders from our president.” A Trump lawyer criticized Democrats for showing the videos of rioters citing the former president as a reason for assaulting the Capitol. “I think it’s offensive, quite frankly,” David Schoen told reporters. “It’s an antithesis of the healing process to continue to show the tragedy that happened here, that Donald Trump has condemned, and I think it tears at the American people, quite frankly.”<br />The Democratic managers argued that a key reason to convict Mr. Trump was to stop the same kind of violence from happening again. “We are not here to punish Donald Trump,” Ms. DeGette said. “We are here to prevent the seeds of hatred that he planted from bearing any fruit.” Rep. Ted Lieu (D., Calif.) said: “If we let him get away with it and then it comes to your state capital or it comes back here again, what are we going to say?” He added: “I’m not afraid of Donald Trump running again in four years. I’m afraid he’s going to run again and lose. Because he can do this again.”<br />Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, countered arguments made by Mr. Trump’s attorneys that the former president’s words in the lead-up to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol were “well within the norms of political speech that is protected by the First Amendment,” as they wrote in a recent brief. Mr. Raskin cited a 1969 landmark Supreme Court case in which the high court found that the government couldn’t prohibit free speech and free press “except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.” He compared Mr. Trump to a “fire chief who incites a mob to go set the theater on fire, and not only refuses to put out the fire, but encourages the mob to keep going as the blaze spreads.”<br />As the third session of the trial kicked off, several senators were hunched over their desks or leaning back. Some spent periods outside the chamber or stood watching the proceedings from the back. At one point, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) hung his head and appeared to be resting. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) switched between taking notes, fiddling with his pen and picking his fingernails. Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) was writing on a blank map of Asia. He studied what appeared to be a map of Southeast Asia during Wednesday’s proceedings.</td>

      <td>Actress Gina Carano falls victim to Hollywood’s new McCarthyism for conservatives.</td>
      <td>The Hollywood blacklist is back, baby. Actress Gina Carano lost her role this week as a co-star of the Disney+ series “The Mandalorian.” Her crime? Ill-considered social-media posts, including one that compared hatred of conservatives to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. Online mobs had previously targeted her for outré comments on mask wearing, the “preferred pronoun” fad, and fraud in the 2020 election. #FireGinaCarano trended and Lucasfilm Ltd., the  Disney  subsidiary that produces the “Star Wars” spinoff, predictably obliged. In the now-standard model of scorched-earth personal destruction, the United Talent Agency dumped Ms. Carano as well.<br />The film and television industry has come a long way on the subject of blacklists. During the McCarthy era, the director Elia Kazan gave the House Un-American Activities Committee the names of show-business colleagues he knew to be members of the Communist Party. Others, who refused to name names, were blacklisted by the studios and denied work.<br />For decades, the Hollywood bien-pensant viewed the blacklist as an unforgivable stain on the industry. In 1999 some of the biggest stars in the business sat on their hands when Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar. “Trumbo” director Jay Roach lamented in 2015 that those who’d been blacklisted “were somehow seen as traitors because they had different political views.”<br />In his review of “Guilty By Suspicion,” a 1991 film about the blacklist starring Robert De Niro, Roger Ebert wrote: “History has vindicated those who refused to betray their principles, but how would any of us have responded at the time—when to defy [HUAC] meant virtual unemployment in show business?”<br />Good question. I’m not defending Gina Carano’s posts, although they are probably defensible. I’m defending the principle. If it’s wrong for someone to lose his job because he’s a Communist, it’s wrong for someone to lose her job because she’s a conservative.</td>

      <td>Car maker becomes latest company to suffer fallout over a pricey commercial on advertising’s biggest night</td>
      <td>Jeep’s parent company had tried for more than a decade to persuade Bruce Springsteen to star in one of its commercials. Then this year, it finally landed the rock legend for the highest-profile of appearances: a two-minute ad during the Super Bowl.<br />It backfired quickly.<br />Just days after the commercial aired, the company removed it from YouTube and other platforms following reports that Mr. Springsteen had been charged with driving while intoxicated last November.<br />Allen Adamson, co-founder of Metaforce, a branding firm, said he had never seen a setback of this magnitude involving a Super Bowl ad. “The combination of Springsteen and breakthrough Super Bowl visibility makes this a one-of-a-kind black eye,” he said.<br />The commercial, in which Mr. Springsteen narrated a somber plea for people to come together in the U.S., generated significant buzz before and after it aired during the game, which was watched by 96.4 million people. The spot was featured in many news articles including The Wall Street Journal, and several TV programs aired portions of the ad, likely generating tens of millions of dollars in free publicity for Jeep.</td>

      <td>New York City authorities raided a Long Island City warehouse that they said held more than 1.7 million counterfeit N95 masks, marking one of the biggest single seizures of personal protective equipment since the pandemic began.<br />The Queens County District Attorney’s office, which spearheaded the investigation, charged Zhi Zeng, the warehouse manager, with felony trademark counterfeiting on Wednesday. If convicted, the 33-year-old Brooklyn man faces up to 15 years in prison. Other individuals are under investigation.<br />Authorities said the warehouse was “an elaborate production assembly line” for the counterfeit masks. They also found hundreds of thousands of pieces of other personal protective equipment in the warehouse, including disinfecting wipes, children’s masks, and gowns.<br />“We are living in a horrible pandemic with more than 450,000 Americans dead from Covid-19. This defendant allegedly sold false hope and security and was set to sell more of these counterfeit masks to whomever would pay his price,” Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said.<br />Acting on a tip, law enforcement raided the two-story warehouse in Long Island City earlier this week, and discovered more than 100 shipping pallets “piled high with boxes of 3M-labeled N95 masks,” according to the district attorney’s office. Mr. Zeng, who pleaded not guilty on Wednesday, was present at the time.</td>

      <td>Walt Disney Co.  typically reports its first-quarter earnings with news of a Christmas Day blockbuster performance at the box office, or a holiday surge in theme-park attendance. On Thursday, however, the company again demonstrated how Covid-19 has brutalized its bottom line.<br />Still, its quarter beat pessimistic Wall Street estimates, and Disney registered a profit of $17 million, or one cent a share. The blow came from Disney’s legacy businesses: Two-thirds of North American movie theaters remain closed, and Disneyland is closed to anyone who isn’t showing up for a Covid-19 vaccine shot.<br />In the comparable period a year ago, before the Covid-19 pandemic started to affect the U.S., its profit was $2.11 billion, or $1.16 a share.<br />Disney’s first-quarter profit comes after the company reported two quarterly losses in a row. But in a sign of how much has changed at the world’s largest entertainment company, Disney’s quarterly profit was about 2% of the domestic box-office gross of the company’s top-performing 2019 release, “Avengers: Endgame.”<br />With the traditional movie business hurting, Bob Chapek, approaching his first anniversary as Disney’s chief executive, reiterated the shift toward a streaming-first model.</td>

      <td>His nominee for deputy Labor secretary presided over $11.4 billion in jobless benefits fraud.</td>
      <td>Progressives like to say these days that the Biden Administration is bringing California’s values to the rest of America, and alas that seems to be true. Consider the nomination of California Labor secretary Julie Su to be deputy U.S. Labor secretary after presiding over a gargantuan unemployment benefits fraud.<br />California has paid some $120 billion in unemployment benefits during the pandemic, nearly a quarter of all payouts nationwide. That alone suggests a governance problem. Yet Ms. Su last month disclosed that $11.4 billion has gone to foreign cyber-criminals, prison inmates and other scammers. Another $19 billion in potentially fraudulent claims are under investigation.<br />Local district attorneys and the feds have in recent months brought charges against some of the thieves. They include a former labor agency employee who allegedly filed 100 phony claims in other people’s names that totalled up to $2 million. A $21,000 payment to California Sen. Dianne Feinstein tipped off local investigators but not state workers who paid the claim.<br />Fraud appears to have been pervasive in state prisons with at least one phony claim filed from each facility. Prison payments have added up to more than $800 million. At least 133 death row inmates, including the well-known convicted killer Scott Peterson, had claims filed in their names.<br />One entrepreneurial inmate gathered personal information from her fellow prisoners and shared their details with a parolee who filed claims in their names. The government lost a mere $200,000 on that scam. Unlike the Maserati that one drug trafficker used his phony benefits to buy, the government can’t confiscate the parolee's spoils. She spent it on plastic surgery.</td>

      <td>He’s a ‘patriot,’ a man of faith and courage, Democrats now say.</td>
      <td>One novel, even astonishing, spectacle in President Trump’s impeachment trial has been progressive Democrats singing the praises of Mike Pence. “The Vice President and I don’t agree on too much in politics,” Rep. Joaquin Castro told the Senate jurors Wednesday. “But he’s a man who upholds his oath, his faith, his duty, and most of all upholds the Constitution.”<br />A moment later Mr. Castro called Mr. Pence “a patriot.” Other Democrats concur. “Vice President Pence had the courage to stand against the President, tell the American public the truth, and uphold our Constitution,” said Stacey Plaskett, the delegate for the Virgin Islands. “That is patriotism.” Rep. Ted Lieu said Mr. Pence “stood his ground, like our other brave officials stood their ground.” He added: “Vice President Pence showed us what it means to be an American, what it means to show courage.”<br />Mr. Pence is probably en route to Walter Reed with symptoms of acute whiplash. For years he has been mocked as a Trump bootlicker, a religious weirdo and bigot. In a 2019 tweet directed at Mr. Pence, Mr. Lieu said he hoped “your hate of LGBTQ employees and students will one day dissipate.” On July 16, 2018, Mr. Castro tweeted: “Mike Pence @VP is a Trump zombie at this point.”<br />Recall the furor in 2015 when Mr. Pence, as Indiana’s Governor, signed a state Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Or remember the coverage of Mr. Pence’s years-ago comment that he wouldn’t go to dinner alone with a woman not his wife. Amid the pushing for a first impeachment of Mr. Trump, the media offered grave warnings that President Pence might be even worse.<br />All that is now forgotten, but don’t expect this strange new respect on the left for Mr. Pence to last. As soon as the second impeachment trial wraps, he will go back to being another dark figure in a political “Handmaid’s Tale” told to inspire fear and loathing among Democratic voters. But for everyone else, Mr. Pence’s defense of the rule of law and the Electoral College should stand as a refutation of that caricature.</td>

Taylor and his son Peter M. Taylor could be on a plane to Japan as soon as Friday, barring any last-minute legal intervention.<br />Lawyers for the Taylors didn’t respond to a request for comment.<br />The Taylors were arrested in May at their family home near Boston by federal authorities acting at the behest of Japanese prosecutors. They have spent the past nine months in a county jail, fighting multiple court battles to avoid being sent to Japan to face criminal charges in the escape.<br />A former chief executive of Nissan Motor Co., Mr. Ghosn was facing financial crime charges in Japan and living in a court-monitored house in Tokyo when he disappeared in late 2019. In a plot worthy of Hollywood, he took a bullet train 300 miles from Tokyo to Osaka, then was smuggled inside the huge box onto a waiting private jet.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden said the U.S. has struck deals to purchase 200 million more Covid-19 vaccine doses, following a pledge in January to boost the number of shots available for Americans.<br />Mr. Biden said in a speech at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., that the U.S. signed contracts with  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna Inc.  that require each company to provide an additional 100 million vaccine doses.<br />“We have to stay vigilant, we have to stay focused and for God’s sake, we have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. We can do this,” the president said.<br />The additional vaccines will bring the total number of doses ordered by the U.S. from the two companies to 600 million from 400 million. The administration said in January that it was working on the purchases, which would provide enough supply to vaccinate 300 million Americans in a two-dose regimen, covering all individuals in the U.S. currently eligible to receive the vaccine. The vaccine hasn’t been approved for people under 16 years old.<br />The U.S. also has supply contracts with other companies, including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca PLC and  Novavax Inc.  to provide a combined 500 million doses. These vaccines have not been cleared by regulators, although J&J’s is currently under view for emergency use.</td>

      <td>Strong streaming growth has propelled stock to a record valuation, despite pandemic’s continued pain</td>
      <td>Walt  Disney Co.  has sold its streaming story well. Investors will soon need to start paying attention to the other parts of the empire, though.<br />The entertainment giant’s fiscal first-quarter results reported Thursday afternoon were essentially a repeat of its last update. Customers continue to flock to the company’s streaming offerings but much less to its theme parks and other parts of the company’s business that depend on crowds. Revenue of $16.25 billion edged the Wall Street consensus of $15.9 billion, while operating income of $29 million was nearly double the consensus forecast—even though it also diminished by 99% from the same period last year.<br />Disney’s share price still rose a further 2% after hours following the results. Investors have taken to focusing exclusively on the company’s successful streaming business. Disney+ hit 94.9 million paid subscribers by the end of the quarter—exceeding the 89.7 million expected by analysts, according to forecasts tabulated by Visible Alpha.<br />Disney managed to pick up 8.1 million subscribers in just the last month of the quarter, based on an update the company gave at its Dec. 10 analyst meeting. That alone is notable given the competition Disney faces from its growing raft of streaming competitors. The month included the launch of “Wonder Woman 1984” on HBO Max—the first of a slate of Warner Bros. films that will make their debuts on the service this year. But Disney is now supremely confident in its own streaming prospects; it used that Dec. 10 meeting to lay out targets to grow as big as  Netflix Inc.  by 2024, revving up an already excited investor base. Disney’s stock price has surged 23% since that meeting, compared to a 7% rise by the S&P 500 over the same period.<br />But streaming can’t float the full empire forever. Disney’s theme-park business has benefited in part from a fractured government response to the coronavirus pandemic; Florida allowed the company’s resort in Orlando to open at a reduced capacity in July, while California has said no to the same. As such, theme-park revenue rose 33% from the September quarter but was down 68% from the same period last year. Parks have also typically accounted for about one-quarter of the company’s operating income; domestic and international parks combined lost a little over $1 billion during the December quarter.</td>
