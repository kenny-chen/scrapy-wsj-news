      <td>After months of experimenting with remote work, your company is calling you back to the office.<br />Should you go?<br />“It’s been weighing on me,” Christina Marcellino, a 34-year-old business development manager for a law firm, says of the back-to-work question. It’s all her working-mom friends in Charlotte, N.C., can talk about. “What is it going to look like? What are we going to do?”<br />The calculus is complicated, even if you’re comfortable with your employer’s plans for Covid safety. Some companies will, at least ostensibly, give workers a choice; others will ratchet up the pressure or dole out ultimatums. How much do you push back? How do you decode corporate statements to tell you what you really want to know: Will it kill my career if I stay home?<br />The other variables to analyze feel infinite, the stuff of life: that workout you can now sneak in each morning, the leisurely walk to the bus stop with your kid, the exodus of $15 sad desk salads from your lunch routine. But also, wasn’t the chatter and camaraderie at the office the thing that made work feel…almost fun? Who can even remember at this point?</td>

      <td>Benson Hill Inc. is going public by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company in a deal that values the plant-growing technology firm at $2 billion, the companies said.<br />The operator of a platform that uses machine learning, simulations and genetics to optimize plant growth, Benson Hill is combining with the SPAC  Star Peak Corp. II .  Benson Hill says it can develop breeds of crops like soybeans and yellow peas that mature faster, have higher protein content or taste better, saving growers time and resources.<br />Such ingredients are key for plant-based meat alternatives, and the company is also developing products for animal feed. Cheaper, more-sustainable plant-growing methods are needed to feed the world’s growing population and accelerate the fight against climate change, analysts say.<br />The St. Louis-based company expects to begin commercial production of its ultrahigh-protein soybean by next year and is developing a yellow-pea protein concentrate. It also has a unit that sells fresh produce to grocery stores and food distributors. The roughly $625 million in expected cash proceeds from the deal will accelerate Benson Hill’s bid to bring down plant-based food costs, Chief Executive Matt Crisp said in an interview.<br />“It’s positioning us to really gear shift into another level of growth,” he said.</td>

      <td>Cuomo’s analogy turns out to be apt, albeit for the wrong reason.</td>
      <td>Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently denounced the Supreme Court for taking up a New York gun-rights case because “the streets of New York are not the O.K. Corral.” He may want to retire that analogy because the city’s streets are looking more like Tombstone all the time despite having one of the nation’s strictest gun laws.<br />The mayhem made it to Times Square on Saturday as a gunman shot three innocent bystanders at about 5 p.m., including a four-year-old girl. All three survived. Wendy Magrinat, 23, who was visiting from Rhode Island with her two-year-old and husband, was shot in the thigh.<br />She told the New York Post that she and her family were waiting in line to enter a store when she became aware of men arguing and the shooting began. Here’s a way to attract tourists to the city as the pandemic eases: Come to Times Square on Mother’s Day weekend, and maybe you too can get shot.<br />Similar incidents are multiplying across the city as politicians have vilified police and made it hard for cops to stop and frisk potential suspects for illegal firearms. The New York Police Department reported that shootings tripled in the week before last to 42 incidents. Police figures show shootings are up 83.3% so far this year, and 93.5% over 2019.<br />The evidence is undeniable that New York is trending back to the high-crime days before Rudy Giuliani became mayor in 1994. That was the era when a police precinct in the Bronx was known as Fort Apache. Mr. Giuliani and successor Mike Bloomberg cleaned up the city’s streets, including Times Square. Now the area is beset again by the homeless, panhandlers, and too often criminals.</td>

      <td>A new study finds more virus spread inside homes than work places.</td>
      <td>Covid-19 lockdowns shaved 3.5% off U.S. GDP in 2020 even as the federal government spent more than $2.6 trillion in relief measures. Millions of children fell behind in learning and nearly 100,000 businesses closed for good.<br />Conventional wisdom holds this was worth it because lives were saved by shutting workplaces and schools and telling people to stay home. But a new study by University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan shows the opposite. After the first month of the pandemic, organizations that adopted prevention protocols became safer places than the wider community. Officials who didn’t see that coming forgot that organizations are rational and look for cooperative solutions that improve the welfare of the group, such as reducing the risks of communicable disease.<br />In “The Backward Art of Slowing the Spread? Congregation Efficiencies during COVID-19,” Mr. Mulligan uses empirical data to test the presumption that the workplace was less safe than the home. He recognizes that “absent costly prevention activities, larger groups naturally have more infections per member.”<br />Yet as he notes, people join firms “in part because they value the group’s management of local externalities and public goods.” That’s an economist’s way of saying that the human capital of a company is tied to its capacity to protect employees and serve customers.<br />There is little doubt that infection would spread faster in congregations than in smaller groups if both engaged in similar practices. But since larger groups have an incentive to spend on expensive methods of prevention, larger organizations might be better at prevention than households with fewer people.</td>

So far, no evidence has emerged that the attackers penetrated the vital control systems that run the pipeline, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />But the consequences of an infection spreading to that deeper layer are dire for any energy company. Many machines that control pipelines, refineries and power plants are well past their prime, have few protections against sophisticated attacks and could be manipulated to muck with equipment or cause damage, cybersecurity experts say.<br />Last year, a ransomware attack moved from a natural-gas company’s networks into the control systems at a compression facility, halting operations for two days, according to a Department of Homeland Security alert. The company, which Homeland Security didn’t name, didn’t have a plan to respond to a cyberattack, the agency said.<br />The Colonial ransomware attack is a high-profile example of the online assaults that U.S. companies, schools, hospitals and other organizations now face regularly. It should also serve as a wake-up call for the energy industry’s particular exposure, according to consultants and others who work with companies to shore up cybersecurity.</td>

      <td>The president can’t afford to ignore trade, lest friends in Asia conclude they should work with China.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s new international policy is missing one big pillar: trade. The administration would like to dodge the politics; Democrats have only a narrow majority in Congress, and the party includes many economic isolationists. But America can’t afford to drop out of the competition to write the world’s new trade rules and commercial designs.<br />North America is an immediate opportunity. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Nafta rewrite, enables Americans to challenge labor conditions in individual Mexican plants. The administration could use this power to help build honest Mexican unions—or as an excuse to block exports from America’s southern neighbor. The new infrastructure bill should include “Buy North America” procurement rules to lower costs, fight uncompetitive bid-rigging, and encourage reciprocity. U.S. and Canadian steelworkers share the same union, so they should support continental cooperation. Washington could also lower the soaring costs of home construction by removing penalty tariffs on Canadian lumber.<br />As companies redirect supply chains, the U.S. should make it easier to shift production from China to Mexico. Canadian railways are competing to buy  Kansas City Southern  to streamline the continent’s transport network; Mr. Biden’s team should expedite border and regulatory procedures to capitalize on such private investment.<br />The president knows that Central Americans will keep fleeing north if they are fearful and desperate at home. In addition to assisting with security and the rule of law, the administration should expand provisions in the U.S.-Central American free-trade agreement of 2005 that encourage the region’s cross-border investment and production with Mexico.<br />The U.S. will never compete economically with China in Asia if Americans don’t show up to design regional trade policies. China and 14 other countries have agreed on a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership that lowers trade barriers and establishes common rules of origin. Both China and Britain aspire to join the higher-quality Trans-Pacific Partnership, an 11-nation pact based on U.S. standards. But President Trump withdrew from the TPP, and Mr. Biden has shrunk from making the case to rejoin.</td>

      <td>The war on meat is no figment of the right-wing imagination.</td>
      <td>Larry Kudlow suggested the other day that the Biden administration may declare war on meat. On his Fox Business show, the former Trump economic adviser lampooned a climate-change study from the University of Michigan, which argues that to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, Americans will have to cut back severely on “red meat, poultry, fish/seafood, eggs, dairy, and animal based fats.” To which Mr. Kudlow quipped: “OK, got that? No burger on July 4. No steaks on the barbecue. I’m sure Middle America is just going to love that. Can you grill those brussels sprouts?”<br />It was funny, but the climate lobby wasn’t laughing. Media “fact checkers” called it a “false story . . . another example of a closed ecosystem of information affecting public opinion,” in the Associated Press’s words. The  New York Times ’s  Paul Krugman tweeted: “This is what right-wing politics is down to. It’s all false claims about evil liberals, which the base is expected to believe because it’s primed to believe in liberal villainy.”<br />Hold on a minute. Liberals constantly insist they “follow the science.” Apparently “the science” says if we don’t stop eating meat, cow flatulence will doom the planet. The war on meat is no figment of the right’s imagination.<br />It’s true Joe Biden hasn’t stated he wants to curtail meat production or consumption. But people he listens to have. During a CNN “Climate Crisis Town Hall,” Kamala Harris was asked if she favored changing “dietary guidelines to reduce the consumption of red meat in light of the impact of the climate change.” She said yes: “The balance that we have to strike here, frankly, is about what government can and should do around creating incentives and then banning certain behaviors.”<br />The United Nations Environmental Agency’s newsletter claims that “every bite of burger boosts harmful greenhouse gases.” A tweet from the U.N. last summer warned: “The meat industry is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the world’s biggest oil companies.” Greenpeace asserts on its website that eating meat “makes the planet sick. The livestock sector—raising cows, pigs and chickens—generates as much greenhouse gas emissions as all cars, trucks and automobiles combined.”</td>

      <td>The solution is to ease restrictions on exporting shots and build more production capacity.</td>
      <td>While the U.S. Covid pandemic has been contained, the situation in many countries, particularly India, is dire. It’s essential to get as much of the world vaccinated as quickly as possible to save lives and prevent new variants from emerging. The Biden administration’s support for breaking vaccine patents is a bad precedent that would do no immediate good and substantial long-term harm.<br />There isn’t enough vaccine supply to meet world-wide demand. Many countries have access only to inferior vaccines produced in Russia or China. Understandably, they want the same safe and effective vaccines that are available to Americans. By the end of 2022, U.S. manufacturers will produce more than 12 billion doses of high-quality vaccines, enough to satisfy global needs. And other vaccine candidates are in the pipeline and may be authorized over the next year. But over the next six months, global supply will remain tight.<br />The Biden administration caved to pressure at the World Trade Organization to support waiving intellectual-property protections for Covid vaccines. Some activists have declared victory, even though patent breaking wouldn’t solve the immediate problem and could make a global agreement much more difficult. France, Germany and the U.K. all oppose the idea, and the WTO should reject it. Here are four productive steps the developed world could take instead:<br />First, the U.S. government should stop hoarding doses and make them available for export. Some of the biggest vaccine makers have shown that their manufacturing is stable and growing. The supply chain is reliable, and the U.S. doesn’t need to stockpile hundreds of millions of doses. More can be made available on a rolling basis to countries like India and Brazil.<br />Second, countries that produce quality vaccines such as Belgium, France, Japan, Australia and the U.K., to name only a few, should invest in a major expansion of manufacturing facilities and the attendant supply chain, in return for a guarantee that a high percentage of the vaccines that flow from these efforts go to low- and middle-income nations. This would secure stable production and guarantee a steady supply of high-quality vaccines for vulnerable nations.</td>

      <td>From “The Liberals Who Can’t Quit Lockdown” by Emma Green, the Atlantic, May 4:<br /><br />Policy makers’ decisions about how to fight the pandemic are fraught because they have such an impact on people’s lives. But personal decisions during the coronavirus crisis are fraught because they seem symbolic of people’s broader value systems. When vaccinated adults refuse to see friends indoors, they’re working through the trauma of the past year, in which the brokenness of America’s medical system was so evident. When they keep their kids out of playgrounds and urge friends to stay distanced at small outdoor picnics, they are continuing the spirit of the past year, when civic duty has been expressed through lonely asceticism. For many people, this kind of behavior is a form of good citizenship. That’s a hard idea to give up.<br />And so as the rest of vaccinated America begins its summer of bacchanalia, rescheduling long-awaited dinner parties and medium-size weddings, the most hard-core pandemic progressives are left, Cassandra-like, to preach their peers’ folly.</td>

      <td>Inflation is in focus with this week’s round of economic data.<br />China’s factory-gate prices are expected to surge in April. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal are forecasting a rise in the producer-price index of 6.5% from a year earlier, in part because of a low base for comparison—prices sank in April 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic—but also due to rapidly climbing costs for metals, oil and other materials. The country’s consumer-price index is expected to climb for the second consecutive month.<br />The U.K. economy likely contracted in the first quarter after the government in December responded to rising Covid-19 cases with fresh restrictions on social and economic activity. But a strong vaccination campaign and steady reopening of the economy suggest the downturn was short lived. Economists expect growth to return in the second quarter and the Bank of England is forecasting U.K. gross domestic product will grow by 7.25% in 2021.<br />U.S. consumer prices in April are expected to post their largest annual increase in nearly a decade. Costs are rising for goods and services in high demand and short supply, but the figures will also be amplified by the comparison to prices from a year earlier—when the economy was in a pandemic-induced tailspin. Federal Reserve officials are forecasting only temporary inflation pressures, though not all economists agree with the Fed’s benign outlook.<br />U.S. consumer spending jumped in March as federal-stimulus checks sent household incomes soaring. Economists are forecasting more gains in April, albeit at a slower pace than the previous month. Retail sales—a measure of purchases at stores, at restaurants and online—will likely be helped along as Covid-19 related restrictions are relaxed, vaccination campaigns advance and the broader economy expands.</td>

The Biden administration and Democrats say other factors, including lack of access to child care and shortages of computer chips, are holding back more robust job growth.<br />U.S. employers added a seasonally adjusted 266,000 jobs in April, the Labor Department said Friday. The figure was a sharp slowdown from March and well below the one million jobs economists expected to be created. A separate report showed there were 7.4 million unfilled jobs in the U.S.<br />Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said labor supply is a factor holding back better overall growth, at least temporarily.<br />“There is some truth to the unemployment benefits, maybe, being a disincentive,” he said in a CBS interview that aired Sunday. “I see that in the data and I see that in anecdotes as we talk to people.”</td>

      <td>Several countries have shifted their guidance in recent days on who should receive the  AstraZeneca  PLC vaccine, as public-health officials continue to weigh the risk of the vaccine against the prevalence of Covid-19 cases.<br />The AstraZeneca shot hasn’t been cleared for use in the U.S., unlike Covid-19 vaccines from  Pfizer Inc.,   Moderna Inc.  and  Johnson & Johnson .  But in some wealthy countries where the supply of those vaccines has been more constrained, AstraZeneca doses have been offered to people as young as 30, showing the wide variation even among wealthy countries in vaccination campaigns.<br />On Friday, the U.K.’s vaccines advisory body said the vaccine produced by AstraZeneca, which has raised concerns among health experts due its possible link to rare blood clots, should preferably not be given to people under 40. Previous guidance suggested the vaccine should preferably not be given to people under 30.<br />In Canada last week, members of a national expert panel referred to the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna as the preferred option after elected officials had earlier encouraged citizens to get the first vaccine available, which for some age groups was AstraZeneca’s shot.<br />Meanwhile, German officials on Thursday took the opposite tack, saying they would make the vaccine available to all adults after earlier limiting it to those 60 years and older, as it sought to speed up a vaccination campaign that had gotten off to a slow start.</td>

      <td>The National Academy of Sciences fights bias by explicitly introducing more of it.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration is considering a laudable major expansion in funding for scientific agencies to shore up America’s research base. The money will help, but it doesn’t obviate the need to scrutinize who will be leading the government’s scientific efforts, as many of us did during President Trump’s term in office. The current emphasis in academic hiring on affirmative action shouldn’t be of concern here. We should expect that merit and accomplishment will guide promotion to the highest levels of scientific leadership. Even if the Biden administration may appear more in touch with the concerns of the scientific community, it isn’t excused from the duty to appoint qualified people to leadership positions.<br />Many don’t realize that the largest funder of physical science in the country isn’t the National Science Foundation, whose 2022 budget the Biden administration has proposed to increase by 20%, but the Energy Department. Here, too, the Biden administration is proposing a major funding increase.<br />The DOE Office of Science’s $7 billion budget, set to rise by $400 million, supports research in high-energy and nuclear physics with large accelerators, materials physics with X-ray synchrotrons, fusion and advanced scientific computers, and runs 10 national laboratories employing thousands of researchers.<br />President Biden has nominated Asmeret Asefaw Berhe, a soil biogeochemist from the University of California, Merced, to lead the Office of Science. Ms. Berhe will be the first black woman to lead the science office, happily lending a more diverse face to science in this country.<br />Ms. Berhe’s research program on soil chemistry, exploring the capture of carbon dioxide, is relevant to climate-change policy. But her research expertise isn’t in any of the Office of Science’s major programs, and she has no experience as a scientific administrator and minimal experience with the Energy Department itself. Past directors have been established researchers from one of the major fields supported by the department, or they have administered large private laboratories like Bell Labs—in line with the demands of the job. It is hard not to wonder whether Ms. Berhe is the right choice for a leadership role at the DOE.</td>

The court said Mr. Mandelblit must decide what role he would play in the case by June 8 and planned May evictions will be suspended meanwhile.<br />Even with the court case delayed, the potential for escalation remains with a show of Jewish right-wing strength that is planned for Monday. Right-wing Jewish Israelis typically march through the Old City, including Muslim areas, waving Israeli flags to mark Israel’s capture of East Jerusalem. The event, an Israeli holiday known as Jerusalem Day, is intended as a show of Israeli claims to the contested city.<br />Israeli police said Sunday the march can go ahead.</td>

Most of the components of the rocket’s wreckage were burned up and destroyed during the re-entry, it said.<br />The rocket was sent into orbit to ferry a core component of its space station, the Tianhe module, on April 29. It was the first of a series of planned launches as China begins construction on the space station.<br />The rocket’s size, about the height of a 10-story building, and concerns from space-monitoring organizations that the entry back to earth wouldn’t be controlled caused worry in recent days, as various tracking organizations predicted potential landing sites covering swaths of the planet.<br />While there was a minuscule chance of the debris hitting populated areas, the episode has raised the issue of responsible space behavior, with China ramping up its space program and private corporations globally engaging in space activity.</td>

The plans would be paid for through increased taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans.<br />On Wednesday, Mr. Biden will hold his first formal meeting since taking office with top congressional leaders: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). The meeting will touch on several topics, but is expected to focus in part on the president’s spending proposals, White House aides said.</td>

As long as the Republican Party emphasizes social matters that many of the younger generation do not believe in, they will get fewer and fewer votes, as older voters decline in numbers<br />The Republican Party already has voters who vote Republican because of the party’s more conservative social stances. It needs to talk less about those positions and talk more about other things to attract younger voters. Republicans should emphasize they are for equality for all, but not artificially imposed quotas when it comes to race or gender; that they are against pitting one race against another; that they are pro-immigration, but immigrants must comply with our laws; that they are against defunding the police so that our cities don’t descend into anarchy; that most police shootings involving minorities are not the result of inherent racism; that they favor free speech and do not condone people being shouted down or fired from their job for expressing opinions others do not agree with.<br />These are ideas that most people, young or old, agree with. The Republican Party can grow and prosper. It needs to begin to think young.<br />George Kral<br />Wilmington, Ohio</td>

Mr. Gensler said such incentives—called payment for order flow—represent a conflict of interest for online brokerages, which collectively make billions of dollars a year from the practice. He voiced concern that the trading firms handling most individual investors’ orders control too much of the business.<br />In an interview with CNBC on Friday, Mr. Gensler went further, comparing the retail wholesalers unfavorably with public exchanges whose prices are considered “lit” because they appear publicly for all traders to see.<br />“A lot of these are really just going to the wholesalers, they are not as lit, they’re not as competitive,” he said. “So it’s not as clear we are actually getting best execution in an unlit, internalized wholesaler as contrasted to the lit markets.”</td>

When she stood up, the air was thick with dust and smoke, and she was surrounded by shattered glass.<br />“Suicide attack!” everyone yelled, she said, reflecting how common such attacks have become in Afghanistan. She noticed she was bleeding from her arms. An older sister took her to hospital.<br />“I’m not sure if I will go back to school when I recover,” Zainab, who is in seventh grade, said from her hospital bed Sunday, with her parents by her side. “I don’t want to get hurt again. My body shakes when I think about what happened.”<br />Preventing girls like Zainab from going to school was the likely goal of the terrorists behind Saturday’s attack in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood of Kabul. Widening access to women’s education was one of the most tangible achievements of the 20-year U.S. presence in Afghanistan—progress that could be reversed once American forces leave the country later this year.<br />Afghan authorities on Sunday raised the official death toll from Saturday’s attack that targeted schoolgirls at Sayed Shuhada to 53. It was the latest assault on the area’s mostly Shiite Hazara minority, which in recent months has suffered horrific attacks by Islamic State’s Afghan affiliate, including on a maternity ward and an education center.</td>

      <td>Did you ever dream of seeing Elon Musk, the Tesla-designing, space-chasing crypto booster masquerade as a lovelorn Icelandic talk show producer? Me neither, but there Musk was, at week’s end, on “Saturday Night Live,” rotating through sketches and wigs as the program’s guest host—another surreal event, maybe not as surreal as a mega-billion currency system based on a dog joke, to remind us that our world is a little sideways, and may possibly be, as Musk cracked in his opening monologue, “a video game…and we’re all just computer simulations being played by a teenager in another planet.”<br />Can a tech zillionaire be funny? It’s never been a prerequisite for the job, but Musk seemed open to try, striding onto the iconic Studio 8H stage in a black double-breasted suit that appeared borrowed from the rack at Armani Mars. He proudly said he was the first person to host “Saturday Night Live” with Asperger’s syndrome—“or at least the first to admit it”—and leaned into jokes about his social awkwardness and his unpredictable outbursts on Twitter. (“We’re actually live right now, which means I could say something truly shocking…Like I drive a Prius.”) He brought on his mother, Maye (the whole SNL opener was a big Mother’s Day tribute, with cast moms) who reminded the world of the $500 that a 12-year-old Elon once won for designing a videogame, and expressed excitement at what her son would get her for Mother’s Day.<br />“I just hope it’s not dogecoin,” Maye Musk said.<br />“It is,” Elon Musk said.<br />And there it was: the crossing of the streams, the first mention of the cryptocurrency Musk had helped shoot to the moon and which had soared in advance of his SNL appearance. There really were two concurrent events to monitor Saturday night—Musk on TV, making jokes, and also the dogecoin roller coaster during the show. And it was a roller coaster: the Robinhood trading app briefly hit pause amid a flurry of activity. Historically, this has not been how money, or SNL, is experienced, but whatever. Welcome to 2021, where the stodgy are no match for the stonky.</td>

      <td>Investors in search of higher returns and lower taxes are scooping up debt sold by state and local governments, pushing borrowing costs to near-record lows and boosting coffers from California to Connecticut.<br />Investors have poured a net $39 billion into municipal-bond mutual funds this year through Thursday, according to data compiled by Municipal Market Analytics, the most over the same period since 2008. Returns on the debt, which local governments use to fund public works such as sewers or bridges, have beaten those of corporate bonds and Treasurys.<br />Demand is so intense that Illinois, the only state to tap the Federal Reserve’s pandemic emergency-lending facility, recently sold three-year bonds at yields near 1%. Another boost is coming from the Biden administration’s proposed tax changes, which potentially can make municipal debt more attractive to investors. Considered almost as safe as Treasurys because they are backed by taxes or payments on essential services like water, municipal bonds typically offer interest payments that are tax-free.<br />The furor marks a reversal from the pandemic’s lows. In the spring of 2020, cash-hungry investors dumped even safe munis at steep discounts. Many predicted tax collections would plunge and mounting financial distress would spur a wave of defaults. City and state borrowing froze. Defaults did climb, but investors started to return after actions by the Federal Reserve that April—including cutting interest rates and buying billions worth of bonds—buoyed the municipal-debt market and the economy. Tax collections exceeded expectations, state and local governments lifted revenue forecasts for this year and stimulus money from the federal government began flooding in.<br />Bank of America analysts in a recent note said the municipal market is entering “a new golden decade of strong growth and strengthening credit quality.” Moody’s Investors Service raised its outlook for state and local governments to “stable” from “negative” after the passage of the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill in March, saying the funds would stabilize state finances and help avoid funding cuts for local governments.</td>

Some also have filed separate grievances with disciplinary bodies that can reprimand, suspend or disbar attorneys who violate their professional obligations.<br />Judges issue sanctions rarely. They can include a requirement to pay the other side’s attorneys’ fees, other legal costs, or penalties to the court, as well as nonmonetary actions such as a censure or mandatory ethics training.<br />In Michigan, Gov.

      <td>As countries rush to get their citizens vaccinated, a debate is heating up among economists about how much herd immunity matters for the world’s economic recovery—or even if it does.<br />Some view herd immunity—the point at which a critical mass of a population become immune to a disease-causing virus or bacteria—as a key factor in determining when Covid-19 will be conquered and economies will return to normal. Until herd immunity is reached, some say, governments will restrict activities to prevent the disease’s spread, resulting in fewer goods and services being produced and consumed.<br />Other economists say businesses can reopen and economic activity can rebound without full herd immunity, and likely will.<br />Part of the challenge for economists is that it is hard to know exactly when a given place will achieve herd immunity, if ever. For Covid-19, epidemiologists generally believe it will require having at least 60% to 80% of a population develop antibodies, curbing the virus’s ability to spread.<br />Economists at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  have tried to incorporate immunity estimates into their forecasts by looking at daily vaccination progress around the world and take account of estimates of how many people have already been infected.</td>

      <td>Epic Games has raised questions about the safety of the App Store; one witness said it’s like ‘bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight’</td>
      <td>In its courtroom battle with  Apple Inc.,  Epic Games Inc. is questioning a core tenet of the iPhone maker’s App Store business: that its success relies upon rigorous policing of the platform.<br />Apple for years has said its rules and vetting process for apps protect users from malicious software and abuse, work that helps justify the up to 30% cut it takes of digital transactions there. In documents and testimony in a lawsuit being argued this month before a federal judge in Oakland, Calif., Epic has said Apple’s contentions don’t hold up to scrutiny.<br />The App Store’s business model, which has been called a “walled garden” due to the company’s tight controls, faces rising criticism from a host of developers, from  Spotify Technology SA  to  Facebook Inc.<br />Epic and others are seeking to undermine Apple’s rationale for its control of third-party software on its more than one billion iPhones, claiming the operating system is what keeps users safe, not the App Store review process. Epic contends others could safely vet apps if allowed to create their own app stores.<br />“To justify its walled garden, Apple needed to convince those locked in and those locked out that the wall served some higher purpose, something more than profitability—and so Apple security justification was born,” Katherine Forrest, an Epic lawyer, told a judge this past week during the start of the trial, expected to last most of May.</td>

      <td>“Come on. I’m right here, inside your unnecessarily puffy coat. No, not that pocket—the one with the stale muffin crumbs and crumpled CVS receipt.”<br />My often-misplaced work ID card can’t tell me how it really feels, thankfully, but it does now communicate with me via the $29 Apple AirTag tracker I’ve attached to it. Right now, it says it’s 7 feet to the left, and likely on another floor, which would put it in my guest-room closet.<br />Lost-item trackers, the high-tech savior of the forgetful, aren’t new. Attach these small Bluetooth-powered doodads to the items you fear you might lose—keys, wallet, bag, pet—and they communicate their whereabouts to your phone. Tile, one of the pioneers in the space, sells four different flavors for iPhone and Android, ranging from the $25 Tile Mate to the $35 Pro.  Samsung ’s  got its $30 SmartTag for Galaxy phones. Now Apple’s bottle-cap-size AirTag for iPhone owners has arrived, and it topples the others in the world-wide game of hide-and-seek.<br />After two weeks of “losing” items with those trackers attached, the AirTags, in concert with my iPhone’s Find My companion app, proved to be the best. Whether it was a remote control squished between couch cushions or Wasabi, my on-loan drug-detection dog at the park (see video for that story), two unique Apple technologies led me right to them.<br />Yet Apple’s smallest gadget also further enables two big threats in today’s tech world: a giant company’s ever-expanding control and consolidation, and a vast, powerful network that could easily be abused by bad actors. Allow me to help you find your way.</td>

Why the course never came to be is at the center of two lawsuits Wharton filed against the education company it tapped as a partner to administer the course.<br />The executive-education course had been taught in previous years by some of Wharton’s top management professors, and a third party called CredForce America Inc. marketed and managed it, signing up executive students and collecting tuition payments under the TMI-Wharton brand. Such arrangements are increasingly common as business schools expand lucrative executive-education offerings.<br />TMI-Wharton emailed enrollees last spring to say the August program would be delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Enrollees got another email this past February, this time from the business school, saying Wharton had severed business ties with CredForce and the TMI-Wharton brand, and hadn’t received the executives’ tuition payments from CredForce.</td>

      <td>Some top companies have de-emphasized test scores—but not everyone got the message</td>
      <td>For years, M.B.A. students and admissions experts believed that top consulting firms and investment banks wouldn’t let job applicants even interview if their score on the GMAT—the standardized test required for most graduate business and management programs—was below a certain threshold. In recent years, that may have become a myth.<br />As many business schools across the country began waiving test requirements last summer for the GMAT, some prospective students began wondering what skipping the test would mean for their chances at landing a job at a top firm.<br />“Candidates are anxious about this,” said Petia Whitmore, a former dean of graduate admissions at Babson College and founder of admissions consulting firm My M.B.A. Path. Some students, she added, are concerned that getting a test waiver from a school will be counted against them in the hiring process. “Even those who got a waiver are saying: Should I take a GMAT later, so I’m not out of the MBB [McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group and Bain, the Big Three strategy consulting firms]?”<br />Now, firms such as Bain, Goldman Sachs and McKinsey say that’s not the case. They, too, have put less emphasis on standardized tests as part of their recruiting in recent years.<br />That change may not have trickled down to applicants and admissions officials. Linda Abraham, founder and president of admissions consulting firm Accepted.com, says the view still prevailed that most top-tier consulting companies and banks, which annually hire droves of top M.B.A. students, used as screening tools the GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) or the GRE (Graduate Record Examinations, a general graduate school admissions test). “I certainly thought it was true,” Ms. Abraham says, “but I assumed it was changing because the schools weren’t going to have it and improve on diversity, equity and inclusion.”</td>

      <td>Mayson VanMeter hoped to switch gears from her cashier jobs to find a more career-oriented internship in human resources this summer, after her freshman year in college—but she hit a wall.<br />“It’s kind of hard to find a paid internship, honestly,” says the 19-year-old University of Southern Indiana student. She has been applying online to numerous posts listed on LinkedIn and Google, but hasn’t heard back from anyone yet. She is vaccinated and open to in-person work. But with her school year ended, she feels like the kind of summer experience she wants may not be in the cards.<br />“If I can’t find an internship, then I’ll probably stay here at Rural King,” she says of the farm-supply store chain where she’s worked since January. She is paying her way through college and says some income is essential.<br />This year is shaping up as a boom year for summer jobs for young people, but it’s an uneven spread. Industries that traditionally hire teenagers, like hospitality and retail, are rapidly expanding again. Millions of young adults have been vaccinated against Covid-19, making them more comfortable than they were last year with high-contact, in-person jobs. And many teenagers, who suffered some of the biggest job losses in 2020, really need the money.<br />But for those interested in more white-collar work like paid internships and research gigs, it can still be competitive. Short-term positions are often not critical to running a business, so there are fewer of them available in many fields than there were before the pandemic, says AnnElizabeth Konkel, a Washington, D.C.-based economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, a research arm of the jobs website Indeed.</td>

The profit margin would be the company’s narrowest since before the mortgage boom.

Only the U.K. government has the authority to sanction a vote. But the nationalists’ ranks were bolstered by growing support for the Scottish Green Party, which also campaigned for independence, setting the stage for a protracted standoff.<br />Together they have a majority of 72 seats in the 129-member legislature, an increase from the last vote five years ago.<br />Ms. Sturgeon, who is Scotland’s first minister, or government leader, wasted little time laying out her plans to force a vote some time in the next five years.</td>

He has won a global following and, for the first time, the show will be livestreamed internationally in over 100 countries via YouTube, NBC said Saturday.<br />His eclectic, from-the-hip style has helped the SpaceX and Tesla chief cultivate a loyal following and generate buzz around his ventures. It has also landed him in some hot water, and will make for an interesting comic cocktail on live—albeit mostly scripted—broadcast TV.<br />In a teaser for his appearance, Mr. Musk called himself a wild card before promising to be “good-ish” with his mom slated to be attending the show for Mother’s Day.</td>

      <td>The attack on Shiite area amplifies concerns that Afghanistan will slip into sectarian violence as U.S. withdraws</td>
      <td>KABUL—Militants killed at least 30 people in three explosions targeting girls outside a school in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood in Kabul, officials said, an attack that could exacerbate sectarian tensions ahead of the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan.<br />The blasts hit the Sayed Shuhada school in the Dasht-e Barchi area of west Kabul, an area populated largely by the Shiite Hazara community. The area has suffered a string of deadly attacks in recent months.<br />No group claimed responsibility for the bombings. In the past, Islamic State’s regional affiliate, which considers Shiites to have rejected Islam, usually took credit for attacks targeting Shiite civilians. While the Taliban harshly oppressed the Hazaras when the movement ruled most of Afghanistan in the 1990s, the Taliban now say they tolerate the Shiite minority.<br />A Taliban spokesman tweeted to condemn Saturday’s attack, accusing Islamic State of being behind it. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, however, blamed the Taliban. In a statement condemning the bombings, he said that “the Taliban, by intensifying their illegitimate war and violence, showed that they have no interest in a peaceful solution to the current crisis.”<br />The Sayed Shuhada school is home to male and female students studying in separate shifts. The explosions went off in the afternoon, as girls were leaving for the day.</td>

      <td>Bloc says exporting more doses would aid struggling nations faster</td>
      <td>European Union leaders pushed back against President Biden’s call to waive intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines, saying exporting more shots would be a faster way to help poor countries struggling to contain the virus.<br />The EU is ready to discuss the U.S. stance, which the Biden administration voiced earlier this week, when there is a concrete proposal, European Council President Charles Michel said at a summit in Portugal on Saturday.<br />“We don’t think in the short term that it’s the magic bullet,” Mr. Michel said of the proposal to lift patent protections, which could enable companies in developing countries and others to manufacture their own versions of Covid-19 vaccines.<br />German Chancellor Angela Merkel also rejected the idea of waiving Covid vaccine patents. She said a waiver wouldn’t make more vaccine doses available and countries should protect “the power of innovation” and patent protections. Germany is home to  BioNTech SE ,  which co-developed a vaccine with  Pfizer Inc.,  and  CureVac  NV, which is running clinical trials for a Covid vaccine.<br />The Biden administration’s embrace of the waiver sent the EU scrambling to explain its plans to help poor countries when the U.S. and Europe are quickly vaccinating their populations. The more the virus spreads, the more likely it is to mutate into a vaccine-resistant strain.</td>

      <td>A handful of neighborhoods with histories of violence are the primary source of a recent surge in killings in Chicago, New York and elsewhere</td>
      <td>A murder wave in U.S. cities that started last year is carrying forward into 2021, and a growing body of research shows a pattern behind the rise: It has been concentrated in relatively few poor neighborhoods, typically Black and Hispanic, with persistent histories of violence.<br />As elected officials and communities search for solutions, recognizing this geographical reality is essential, say social scientists and police officials who have studied the murder wave. Police and other city authorities will need to focus their efforts on a few areas that have missed out on the urban renaissance of the past two decades as their middle-class residents have fled. Controversy over policing has complicated matters after the conviction of Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, for the killing of George Floyd, a Black man. “The problem isn’t going away,” said Jens Ludwig, director of the University of Chicago’s Crime Lab. “People in my world are very nervous about the summer of 2021.”<br />Homicide is up 9.1% in New York so far this year and 22% so far in Chicago, following double-digit increases in both places and in many other cities last year. Mr. Ludwig calculates that nearly three-quarters of Chicago’s homicide increase in 2020 was concentrated in a cluster of eight of the city’s 25 police districts, mostly in the city’s predominantly Black South Side and largely Hispanic West Side.<br />Similar patterns have shown up elsewhere. New York saw a 47% increase in homicide in 2020 concentrated in a patch of Brooklyn neighborhoods with a long history of violence, including Brownsville, Crown Heights and Bedford Stuyvesant. It also hit the south Bronx and the Harlem section of Manhattan, said Michael LiPetri, the New York Police Department’s chief of crime control strategies.<br />In St. Louis, six of 76 neighborhoods, representing 7% of the city population, accounted for half of the 2020 homicide increase to 264 from 194, said Richard Rosenfeld, a crime researcher at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. They tended to be minority and poor, he said. In Philadelphia, most of the increases in shootings and homicides were concentrated in areas northeast and southwest of the city center, places long plagued by violence, according to data compiled by David Abrams, a crime researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.</td>

      <td>An unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus led by the Federal Reserve is fueling a new investor euphoria. Is this a new bubble? And when could it burst?</td>
      <td>To veterans of financial bubbles, there is plenty familiar about the present. Stock valuations are their richest since the dot-com bubble in 2000. Home prices are back to their pre-financial crisis peak. Risky companies can borrow at the lowest rates on record. Individual investors are pouring money into green energy and cryptocurrency.<br />This boom has some legitimate explanations, from the advances in digital commerce to fiscally greased growth that will likely be the strongest since 1983.<br />But there is one driver above all: the Federal Reserve. Easy monetary policy has regularly fueled financial booms, and it is exceptionally easy now. The Fed has kept interest rates near zero for the past year and signaled rates won’t change for at least two more years. It is buying hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds. As a result, the 10-year Treasury bond yield is well below inflation—that is, real yields are deeply negative —for only the second time in 40 years.<br />There are good reasons why rates are so low. The Fed acted in response to a pandemic that at its most intense threatened even more damage than the 2007-09 financial crisis. Yet in great part thanks to the Fed and Congress, which has passed some $5 trillion in fiscal stimulus, this recovery looks much healthier than the last. That could undermine the reasons for such low rates, threatening the underpinnings of market valuations.<br />“Equity markets at a minimum are priced to perfection on the assumption rates will be low for a long time,” said Harvard University economist Jeremy Stein, who served as a Fed governor alongside now-chairman Jerome Powell. “And certainly you get the sense the Fed is trying really hard to say, ‘Everything is fine, we’re in no rush to raise rates.’ But while I don’t think we’re headed for sustained high inflation it’s completely possible we’ll have several quarters of hot readings on inflation.”</td>

Mr. Calderon’s father got it instead.<br />This February, his father sold the image for $46,000.<br />Tied to the image was a nonfungible token, or NFT. Called a CryptoPunk, it is one of 10,000 unique, algorithmically generated digital images created by two software programmers in 2017. The images were designed to be traded on blockchain, a digital ledger that records transactions, and they were originally released to be claimed free by anyone with a blockchain “wallet,” or account.<br />The rapid evolution of the market for such NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, has pulled the digital assets from near-obscurity to become quickly ingrained in the vernacular. “Saturday Night Live” set aside three minutes of a March episode to explain them in a rap sketch. In the first quarter this year, the total value of NFT sales on the ethereum network, the main blockchain underlying such transactions, surged to $2 billion in the first quarter from $94 million in the previous three-month period, according to data-tracking site NonFungible.com.<br />“Where we are now, I expected to be in five years,” Mr. Calderon, the 40-year-old founder of Art Blocks, an NFT art project, said. “It’s been this crazy explosion.”</td>

      <td>Her wings clipped during the pandemic, a New Yorker finds a sweetly ‘madcap’ seaside destination just a ferry (or bike) ride from home</td>
      <td>COMPARED WITH many Brooklyn neighborhoods, Red Hook doesn’t get a lot of visitors. Bordered to the west by the Buttermilk Channel, and to the south by the Erie Basin and the Gowanus Bay, Red Hook is perhaps best-known to New Yorkers as the site of the city’s only IKEA store. Although the area is just a few minutes’ drive from lower Manhattan, it isn’t easy to reach by public transit. The closest subway station—at Smith and 9th Street—requires a 15-minute walk under the unprepossessing shadow of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Two ferry lines serve the neighborhood but one of them has been suspended since the beginning of the pandemic.<br />But despite its relative inaccessibility—or because of it—I’ve been in love with the neighborhood for almost as long as I’ve been an adult. I discovered it by accident, several years ago, when I went to review an experimental play at the floating Waterfront Barge Museum, located on what was once the 1914 Lehigh Valley Barge. I got lost on my way from Carroll Gardens and ended up wandering through the neighborhood’s community gardens and still-working warehouses before coming to the pier, at last, at dusk, to watch the sun set in brilliant pink over the Statue of Liberty: so much closer, from there, than from Manhattan. Since then, I’ve corralled reluctant friends to join me in the neighborhood whenever possible, despite the trek: to have brunch (and the much-lauded “city’s best” Irish coffee) at local restaurant Fort Defiance. Or else to tear into whole lobsters at the Red Hook Lobster Pound, or to listen to live music at insalubrious hours at Sunny’s, a vaguely nautical bar just off the waterfront where musicians—Irish, bluegrass, folk, klezmer, jazz—play six nights a week. Eccentric and eclectic, Red Hook feels less like a neighborhood of New York than like a city in itself or a madcap seaport like Italy’s Trieste, that I’d loved. One seemingly residential window on Van Brunt Street is home to an inexplicable display of Betty Boop dolls; a local crèche in an empty lot has become the de facto home of the area’s stray cats.<br />During the worst months of the pandemic—when I avoided subways altogether—I took to biking from my home in Morningside Heights to Red Hook, via the Manhattan Bridge and the reassuringly separated waterfront bike paths along the Brooklyn waterfront. I’d work on my laptop outdoors at local cafes, or else at the pizzeria Hoek, where I could watch night fall on Manhattan from the outdoor tables off the Valentino Pier. I’d listen to the musicians at Sunny’s play impromptu concerts on Conover Street.<br />When the opportunity arose for me and my husband to temporarily relocate to the neighborhood, I took it. A few days later I had a routine. I’d wake up to the sound of foghorns—the piers were just a five-minute walk away—or else to the cawing of gulls. I’d spend mornings working alongside Billy, a neighborhood cat who adopted me, in the heated back garden of the Black Flamingo cafe.<br />Lunch involved darting across the street to Mark’s Red Hook Pizza—where the proprietor memorized my order, called me darling, and insisted on careening across the floor to open the door for me—then cycling to one of the neighborhood’s numerous waterfront picnic spots. I’d work on various benches, stopping from time to time to listen to the vinyl music invariably echoing from the Red Hook Record Store ($3 books in the cart outside), or buy groceries at Fort Defiance: repurposed during the pandemic into a high-end general store.</td>

      <td>It means that an asset has hit a level unseen for some time. One could be coming for crude-oil futures.</td>
      <td>Sometimes Wall Street pros refer to an event known as a “breakout.” For those unfamiliar with the term, here is what it means and why it matters to investors.<br />A breakout refers to a pattern in a price chart where the price of a stock (or other traded asset) breaches a previously unbroken level or a level that hasn’t been breached in a long time, says JC Parets, founder of technical-analysis service AllStarCharts.com. Put simply, the price has “broken out” of a previously defined trading range.<br />The first part of the pattern starts when a stock rallies to a certain level, but then retreats, Mr. Parets says.<br />“What happens is that there is an overwhelming amount of supply at that price level,” he says, meaning investors dump the stock, sending the price lower.<br />A recent example is  ETF (XLF), which tracks a basket of financial stocks. In 2007, before the financial crisis the ETF reached a then-record price of around $31 a share. It traded lower than that for 12 years and didn’t revisit $31 until late 2019. It retreated once again as the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns sent stocks reeling in early 2020. The ETF’s eventual breakout came earlier this year when the price broke through the $31 level. It closed Friday at $37.78.</td>

Apple has defended itself by arguing that its app-marketplace policies are fair and that Epic breached a contract applicable to all developers distributing apps on its mobile devices.<br />The trial, in which U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers will decide the outcome, is slated to run at least three weeks in Oakland, Calif., and could help reshape the multibillion-dollar market for distributing apps on mobile devices.<br />Here’s an overview of what has happened so far, the moments that stood out and what is next:<br />Lawyers for Epic called the first set of witnesses, starting with the company’s chief executive and founder, Tim Sweeney. The 50-year-old programmer said Apple’s 30% commission on digital app sales have created a “significant economic drag” and harmed his company’s ability to reinvest in its business. He also defended Epic’s decision last year to insert its own payment-processing system into “Fortnite,” a move that violated Apple’s requirement for developers to use its processor for in-app purchases of digital goods.</td>

      <td>With children listening on devices for longer hours, there are steps parents can take to lower the volume and safeguard hearing health</td>
      <td>How many times have you walked into a room and had to yell that dinner is ready, only to have your kids stare blankly at you, if they look up from their screens at all? I can’t count the number of times I’ve had to raise my voice when my kids were engrossed in a game or movie they were listening to through headphones.<br />Were they just ignoring me? I doubt it, because this happens even when I announce there’s pizza. It probably means that the volume on their devices was cranked up too loud and I should do something about it before I lose my voice—and my temper.<br />Noise-induced hearing loss is on the rise among young people. Some audiologists say they suspect the problem has only gotten worse during the pandemic, when kids have been glued to their devices for school, entertainment and social connection.<br />An estimated 12.5% of children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 19 have already suffered permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The World Health Organization said last month that more than a billion young adults are at risk of permanent, avoidable hearing loss due to unsafe listening practices, with nearly half of all people ages 12 to 35 in wealthy countries listening to personal audio devices at unsafe sound levels.<br />Fortunately, safeguards are readily available. Noise-canceling and volume-limiting headphones, as well as settings on the devices themselves, are tools parents can use to protect kids’ ears.</td>

On Wednesday, the house will let 50 of its top collectors and dealers bid from cabaret-style tables spread around its Manhattan saleroom. Christie’s will remain live streamed.<br />However collectors choose to participate, they say the series overall will give them their first opportunity in months to gauge the popularity and price levels of everything from trophy paintings to oversized sculptures to works by once-overlooked women.<br />Last spring’s series didn’t happen as scheduled because the pandemic pushed offerings into a mashup of one-size-fits-all sales held midsummer, and the fall sales saw volatile bidding, with major pieces like a Mark Rothko selling for at or below their estimates.<br />This week’s round is smaller in volume than past years and appears unlikely to surpass the $1.8 billion total achieved by a similar series held in May 2019. Even so, sellers say they feel increasingly confident about the art market’s trajectory, with 27 works up for bid carrying an asking price of $10 million or more.</td>

      <td>Thematic ETFs, exchange-traded funds that focus on specific investment themes, are booming And one of the most-talked-about themes lately is space. There is no shortage of ways to invest in the final frontier.<br />Historically, the way to invest in space has been in aerospace and defense ETFs.<br />Before Elon Musk was shooting cars into orbit, space exploration was a purely governmental affair. Aerospace and defense companies were building the rockets, and many of them still are.<br />Funds with large positions in companies like  Boeing ,   Lockheed Martin  or  Northrop Grumman  tend to have lower volatility and turnover than funds focused on the newer, high-growth companies that compete in space. Aerospace and defense ETFs come in both actively managed and passive, or index, varieties. On the passive side,  ETF (ITA) and  ETF (XAR) offer broad exposure to the old guard of companies in this sector and low turnover. ITA has an expense ratio of 0.44% and XAR 0.35%.<br />On the active side, the leveraged fund  (DFEN) is designed for short-term investing. This fund’s goal is to provide triple the daily return of the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index; but it can also triple the losses if the market goes the other way. You’ll also have to pay up for it: With an expense ratio of 0.99%, DFEN is more expensive than an unleveraged ETF. Leveraged ETFs have grown in popularity with investors in recent years, but it is best to work with your financial adviser to determine whether a short-term fund is best for your thematic investment goals.</td>

      <td>Celebrities from Elizabeth Taylor in the 1950s to Lisa of Blackpink and BTS in 2020 have brought high fashion to the airport. Though the pandemic paused that peacocking, it shows signs of returning.</td>
      <td>Off Brand is a column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />WHAT IF the peak of airport style was not the 1950s or ’60s but…this decade? Although mid-century celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor and Diana Ross are rightly held up as beacons of glamorous travel, some of the most stylish stars of today rivaled them before the pandemic grounded much travel. In late February 2020, the members of the K-pop boy band BTS took off from Incheon Airport in South Korea wearing a vibrant mishmash of contemporary fashion: a pert navy Thom Browne peacoat; some Celine superprep; and at least one louche Rick Owens look. Their fashion choices suggested the same optimistic sense of freedom as a trip to New York did back then. And the looks—distinctive, intentional, luxurious—were characteristic of a generation of stars who treat the airport as a runway, including the musicians Lisa from Blackpink and Justin Bieber, and the models Kendall Jenner, Kaia Gerber, and Gigi and Bella Hadid.<br />That is, until they couldn’t. The pandemic, which curtailed air travel and sequestered even celebrities to their homes, interrupted a heyday of airport style that has kept paparazzi and gossip websites buzzing for years. Ulrike Ben Mansour, the content executive for the photo agency the Mega Agency, has been dealing in celebrity airport photos since 2000. Over the last year, she said, that pipeline dried up: “I find that with the pandemic, with all the flights having been cancelled, less celebrities travel, so less pictures.” And when pictures do come in, celebrities are masked, so less identifiable.<br />For creative director Jodi Peckman, it was an odd but ultimately fortuitous time to be working on her book, “Come Fly with Me,” recently published by Rizzoli. “I was surprised the book was going to be published, only because of the subject matter—nobody was traveling anymore,” she said, “so it was a book about something that wasn’t happening at the moment.”<br />But the timing gives the book the luster of escapism. Ms. Peckman pored over decades of photos of celebrities in transit, from a 1960s Muhammad Ali in a white suit and briefcase to Lady Gaga in a stewardess-cosplay minidress in 2015. Each picture captures the glamour of travel and celebrity, but without the trappings of photoshoots (lights, retouching, sets) that normally put stars on a pedestal.</td>

      <td>Many women of color are turning to social media and their peers for investment know-how instead of hiring financial advisers.<br />Individual investors are increasingly seeking free financial advice on platforms including TikTok,  Twitter  and YouTube. For women of color, nearly half say they are likely to turn to social media for financial guidance compared with 18% of white women, according to a study released in April by investment-management firm Capital Group.<br />The reasons for turning to their peers range from wanting free advice to a desire to manage their own portfolios, rather than outsourcing it to an adviser.<br />Adri Saul, who is Latina, started investing in the stock market in April 2020 after she joined the HerMoney  Facebook  group. Ms. Saul, who is in her 30s, was attracted to the group that was founded by personal finance author Jean Chatzky to help women with their personal finances, partly because she said it was easy to get answers to money questions and it is a nonjudgmental place to learn about investing.<br />While she appreciates the quality of information she has seen in the group’s posts, she still does her own research. Ms. Saul now has about $5,000 invested in various stocks such as  Twilio Inc.  and DocuSign Inc. with an online broker.</td>

Blame the Texas freeze.<br />The February storm that closed chemical plants across Texas, hobbling production of goods from car parts to smartphones, continues to reverberate throughout the global supply chain.<br />One product that remains in short supply is acrylic acid, the propylene-based compound that makes diapers absorbent. Executives and industry consultants say that shortfall is still a factor in the fast-rising prices of diapers even as demand declines.<br />Suppliers of acrylic acid “just got hammered,” said Michael Murray, who with his two brothers runs DeSales Trading Company Inc., a company that buys and sells so-called superabsorbent polymers made with acrylic acid. “Supply is extremely tight right now.”<br />The global supply chain is in broad upheaval, upended by pandemic- and weather-related production disruptions, demand swings and surging raw materials costs. Diapers are one of many consumer products that are getting more expensive.</td>

      <td>Did your fitness regimen fall into a winter rut? A Mayo Clinic expert offers spring fitness ideas for the upper body, lower body, core and cardio.</td>
      <td>If your home workout isn’t delivering the burn you crave, or you’re bored after a long winter of endless push-ups and squats, here are four routines that will keep you challenged through spring.<br />Adam Maronde, performance manager at the Mayo Clinic in Minneapolis, says a fresh workout doesn’t require new equipment. Small changes such as varying repetitions or adding isometric holds to your exercises can make your old routine feel new. Here, he provides four separate workouts—ones for the upper body, lower body and core, as well as an interval workout for cardio. Perform these throughout the week or string them together for a full-body workout. If you haven’t been exercising regularly, check with your doctor before starting a new routine. As with any workout, listen to your body and modify appropriately.<br />“Contrasting repetitions is an easy way to make your same old routine challenging,” Mr. Maronde says. For the workout below, perform loaded repetitions for the first round of exercises. The weight should be challenging. You can use dumbbells or water bottles, and for the push-up, he suggests wearing a backpack loaded with books. For the second round, lighten the load or use body weight and perform at a normal pace. For the final round, use the same load as round two and perform slow and controlled repetitions on a 3:1:3 tempo, where you raise or lower the weight or your body for three seconds, pause one second and then reverse directions for three seconds.<br />Complete three rounds. Use the stretches as recovery time between exercises. Rest 60 to 90 seconds between rounds.<br />Stand in an open doorway. Raise each arm up to the side, bent at 90-degrees with palms forward resting on the door frames. Step forward with one foot until you feel a stretch in your shoulders and chest without leaning forward. Hold for 20 seconds and switch sides.</td>

These days, they are far from the only people advocating for the legalization of marijuana.<br />Black Lives Matter activists, who are seeking business opportunities for minority communities and say they have been hit hard by drug laws, joined the Hartford rally, as did labor organizers who want to see the industry unionized.<br />More broadly, cannabis companies, banks and new marijuana trade organizations are deploying platoons of lobbyists to state capitals and Washington, D.C., to help shape the ground rules for the industry as more states legalize use, and as Congress weighs measures that could further legitimize the market.<br />A decade ago, a handful of pro-pot companies and interest groups spent less than a half-million dollars on federal lobbying. By 2019, there were dozens of supporters, and they spent more than $8 million to hire about 130 registered lobbyists, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of public lobbying disclosures.<br />Federal lobbying on cannabis declined last year amid the coronavirus pandemic and presidential election, but this year’s first-quarter reports show spending is rebounding. Banks including Morgan Stanley, as well as tobacco and alcohol companies, are beginning to weigh in on federal cannabis policy, according to lobbying records.</td>

It faulted the programs for exposing children to sophisticated marketing tactics and said banks didn’t state clearly a key objective was to attract customers.</td>

      <td>Apps are shifting some costs to customers; restaurants are raising prices on apps and offering cheaper direct orders</td>
      <td>Diners and restaurants alike flocked to delivery apps in record numbers when the pandemic forced establishments to close their dining rooms. The surge in business has driven huge revenue growth for companies like  DoorDash Inc.,   Grubhub Inc.  and  Uber Technologies Inc.,  which owns Uber Eats and Postmates. While the apps’ growth is expected to slow from last year’s levels, the companies say they expect people to order in more frequently than they did pre-pandemic.<br />Wonder why delivery orders have become more expensive during the pandemic? Want to know what share of your money restaurants are getting? Here’s a breakdown of several identical orders from the same New York City restaurant.<br />In many markets, the price of food ordered via delivery app has gone up since the pandemic began. Since apps’ service fees are partly determined by food prices, that means a higher bill overall.<br />Other costs also fall on customers. In California, for example, apps began charging customers a fee related to benefits that they promised drivers. In Philadelphia, where the city capped the amount apps can charge restaurants during the health crisis, DoorDash is charging a “regulatory response fee.”<br />To illustrate this, The Wall Street Journal compared otherwise identical pre-pandemic and 2021 orders from three Philadelphia-area restaurants using DoorDash, Grubhub and Postmates. In each case, this year’s orders were more expensive.</td>

      <td>When you pay people not to work, guess what? Many people don’t.</td>
      <td>An economy doesn’t live by demand alone. There is no clearer evidence of that dictum than Friday’s surprising jobs report for April, which undershot the expectations of economists by more than 700,000. Welcome to the supply-side jobs slowdown.<br />Employers added a net 266,000 jobs in April, while the unemployment rate ticked up 0.1 percentage point to 6.1%. Payrolls for March and February were revised down a combined 78,000, and 48,000 of the new jobs in April were in government, mostly local education as schools reopened.<br />The report wasn’t a total washout, as private payrolls grew 218,000, mostly from leisure and hospitality jobs (331,000) as the lockdowns continued to ease. But there were large losses in temporary positions (-111,400), couriers (-77,400), food and beverage stores (-49,400), and nursing homes (-19,500). Some of this reflects a reallocation of jobs as businesses reopen and consumption shifts.<br />The Keynesians who now run U.S. policy, at the Treasury and Federal Reserve, have been using their usual demand-side playbook. Bathe the country in government cash, keep interest rates at zero, and the resulting rise in consumer demand will drive everything.<br />They’ve underestimated the supply-chain constraints that have been screaming across the economy for months—from too few workers to the computer chip shortage and soaring lumber and freight prices. The economy can’t produce enough goods and services fast enough to meet the soaring demand from the easing pandemic and government policies that have shoveled cash to consumers and rewarded Americans for not working.</td>

      <td>The takeover of higher education by critical-race theory may be a fait accompli, but some parents won’t surrender K-12 education without a fight. That’s the message voters in the Dallas suburb of Southlake sent last weekend.<br />The May 1 special election became a referendum on efforts to impose critical-race theory on the curriculum and practices of Carroll Independent School District. The district’s diversity council developed the so-called “cultural competence action plan” after several students were caught on video uttering racial slurs.<br />The plan called for the district to hire an equity and inclusion director, encourage students to report each other for microaggressions, and revise the curriculum to make it more woke, among other changes.<br />Parents rejected this indoctrination effort, judging by the election results. School board candidates Cam Bryan and Hannah Smith vocally opposed the proposal and won 68% and 69% of the vote, respectively. Southlake Families, a political-action committee opposed to the plan, backed two city council candidates and a mayoral candidate. All three won with about 70% of the vote.<br />Reporting in the national media on the election has predictably portrayed the landslide election result as a victory for bigotry. “A school district tried to address racism, a group of parents fought back,” CNN proclaimed. A Dallas Morning News story featured a tweet claiming that Southlake had “doubled down on racism and White supremacy in their local election.”</td>

Facebook  doesn’t sell books, but it can suppress their distribution when they conflict with a political agenda. The social-media giant now appears to be throttling a Wall Street Journal review of a book on climate science by physicist Steven Koonin, the former top scientist at the Obama Energy Department and provost of the California Institute of Technology.<br />Facebook uses so-called fact-checkers to tell it which news articles to suppress. The project has gone far beyond curbing viral hoaxes or dangerous misinformation and aims to limit scientific debate. In March Facebook flagged a Journal op-ed by Johns Hopkins surgeon Marty Makary on the pace at which Americans would develop herd immunity to Covid-19.<br />The company now targets the Journal’s book review based on a gazillion-word post on a site called Climate Feedback with the headline, “Wall Street Journal article repeats multiple incorrect and misleading claims made in Steven Koonin’s new book ‘Unsettled.’”<br />Mr. Koonin, whose careful book draws extensively on existing scholarship, may respond on the merits in a different forum. Suffice it to say here that many of the “fact check” claims relied on by Facebook don’t contradict the underlying material, but instead argue with its perceived implications.<br />The fact-check attacks Mr. Koonin’s book for saying the “net economic impact of human-induced climate change will be minimal through at least the end of this century.” Minimal is in the eyes of the beholder, but the U.S. National Climate Assessment predicted America’s climate costs in 2090 at about $500 billion per year—a fraction of the recent Covid stimulus in an economy that could be four times as large.</td>

The results mark the next step in what’s becoming a major political realignment in the world’s fifth-largest economy.<br />Voters across the United Kingdom elected a bevy of local councilors, a handful of mayors, and regional parliaments in Scotland and Wales. But the most important result was the Conservative victory in the sole parliamentary by-election. The Tories won in Hartlepool, in northeast England, for the first time since 1974.<br />This is the latest brick to fall from the so-called Red Wall of historically Labour seats that used to stretch across northern England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a historic parliamentary majority in 2019 by flipping large numbers of these seats to the Conservatives, and now he has flipped another.<br />Brexit probably played some role. Hartlepool voted overwhelmingly to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum, putting residents at odds with the Brexit-ambivalent Labour Party that represented them in parliament for decades. Brexit is now over, following Mr. Johnson’s successful 2019 campaign for a new mandate to finish the job. The suspicions voters harbor toward the political class that resisted Brexit appear to remain.<br />Yet something bigger seems afoot. Mr. Johnson’s Tories have broadened their message, and their appeal, beyond Brexit. Promises to “level up” the economy in neglected former industrial regions seem to resonate with voters.</td>

But U.S. government and public-health officials have said they probably don’t need  AstraZeneca  shots because of ample supplies of three other shots already authorized for use.<br />The British drugmaker said last week it intended to apply for the emergency go-ahead within weeks. But it has also been considering a different path to getting the drug approved in the U.S., according to these people. That would involve taking what could be several more months to compile and review data necessary for what is known as a biologics license, essentially a more comprehensive, nonemergency seal of approval from the FDA.<br />The full license is the path most new medicines take on their way to the U.S. market. But Covid-19 vaccine makers including  Pfizer Inc.,   Moderna Inc.  and  Johnson & Johnson  have all sought and received emergency-use authorization as a stopgap, encouraged by the government, with plans eventually to apply for full-blown approval for their respective shots. The emergency-use application allowed all three to win quicker FDA approval in the pandemic.</td>

President Biden has called on Congress to pass legislation in the coming weeks, ahead of the one-year anniversary of Mr. Floyd’s death on May 25.<br />The congressional effort is being led by Sen.

They are leading a small group of lawmakers and their staffs seeking to find compromise legislation that can pass both chambers.<br />The language now being discussed would prohibit the Defense Department from transferring to local police agencies equipment including firearms, bayonets, grenade launchers and some armored vehicles, one of the people involved in the negotiations said. Police departments around the country have had access to surplus military equipment, the use of which has drawn criticism from civil rights groups who say the presence of heavily armed police officers exacerbates tensions during demonstrations.</td>

      <td>To leave behind a plan that lasts, Biden needs to reach across the aisle.</td>
      <td>The U.S. birthrate reached its lowest level ever in 2020, according to data released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Young people are marrying less and having fewer kids in part because they don’t feel confident about their job prospects and financial security. As everyone knows, raising kids is expensive. Health-insurance premiums are 55% higher than they were a decade ago. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in 15 years, and a median starter home now costs $215,000. College tuition has more than doubled in real terms since the 1980s.<br />President Biden’s American Families Plan correctly identifies the problem but offers a temporary, partisan solution. American families need help. The way to do it is by removing financial obstacles for those who want to get married and have kids, encouraging families to support themselves, and treating families the same whether both parents work or one stays at home. Several conservative senators have introduced plans that would do these things. If the Biden administration truly wants to help America’s families, it will offer them something that outlasts his presidency.<br />In February, I proposed the Family Security Act to give American families a healthier financial starting point, especially when kids are young. Every family would receive $350 a month for each child up to 5 and $250 a month for children 6 to 17, up to a total of $1,250 a month. The monthly support would start halfway through a mother’s pregnancy, helping provide peace of mind to expecting parents.<br />My bill would also eliminate the marriage penalty for the Earned Income Tax Credit, which the administration’s proposal would make worse. My plan eliminates income traps that penalize parents for earning more money. And finally, because it takes the maze of current programs for families and rolls many of them up into a new benefit that lets families have more control, it is fully paid for. My plan won’t add to the deficit.<br />There are four reasons why this approach—and those of other GOP senators—is better than Mr. Biden’s. First, my plan would create an immediate permanent benefit, while the president proposes only to make permanent his most controversial changes—things like the bigger EITC marriage penalties, and a new $425 billion government daycare overhaul.</td>

      <td>Ohio and 20 others are suing to challenge an unconstitutional poison pill in the Covid relief law.</td>
      <td>Columbus, Ohio<br />Congressional Democrats last month quietly attempted one of the most sweeping takeovers of state policy making in American history. The ill-conceived American Rescue Plan Act offered states nearly $200 billion in emergency pandemic-relief funding. As is often the case with “free” money, there was a catch.<br />In exchange for the federal aid, states are prohibited from directly or indirectly using the funds to offset a reduction in net tax revenue. In other words: No tax cuts, no tax credits, no tax rebates, no policy changes that reduce tax revenue or forestall future tax increases. It’s as though Congress now presides over every statehouse in the country and has announced: “Read our lips. No new tax cuts.”<br />Not surprisingly, some states would still like to set their own policies. Twenty-one have sued the Treasury Department, asking federal courts to enjoin this unprecedented congressional power grab. Ohio stood up for itself immediately; its attorney general filed the first lawsuit against the tax mandate within a week of President Biden’s signing the law. The Buckeye Institute agrees with Ohio that the mandate exceeds congressional authority and filed a brief to the same effect.<br />Under the new law, if the Treasury secretary determines that a state has violated the tax mandate, she may then claw back “the amount of the applicable reduction to net tax revenue” or the amount of funds received by the state, whichever is less. This condition enables the federal government to seize the levers of state policy completely.</td>

      <td>The institution had no choice but to expand downward in an impressive $233 million project.</td>
      <td>Philadelphia<br />Museums never have enough space; like hospitals and airports they restlessly expand. But the Philadelphia Museum of Art, stranded on its urban Acropolis—the Ben Franklin Parkway to the east and Fairmount Park to the west—has no room to grow, at least not horizontally. In 2006 it boldly decided to expand downward, within its footprint. This would be done in stages and the first, officially known as the Core Project, opened Friday. Costing $233 million, it gives the museum an additional 90,000 square feet and is, from the exterior, completely invisible.<br />The architect of the project was Frank Gehry, a surprising choice. He designed the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao (1997), the free-form jubilee of curved, tapered, and angular shapes, sheathed in shimmering titanium, that best expresses his signature style. The building was widely understood as an assault on the very idea of the traditional museum, the “encyclopedia encased in a palace,” as the sneer ran. And as museums go, the Philadelphia Museum of Art is as encyclopedic and palatial as they come. But if Mr. Gehry was not known for gently altering historic buildings, let alone a neoclassical temple like the PMA, he brought star power to a city with a chronically weak self-image.<br />His task was complicated by the museum’s intricate plan. A U-shaped complex, it opens up to the east with a broad terrace and the mighty stairs made famous by the “Rocky” movies. But its two public entrances were designed to lead the visitor upwards and, even worse, were on different levels. The great eastern stair hall sits higher than the west entrance hall, a concession to the hilltop site.<br />In his effort to open up the building, Mr. Gehry was aided by its great hidden asset, the Vaulted Walkway, a 640-foot long barrel-vaulted passage that runs dramatically across its full width, from north to south, across the bottom of the “U.” Once a secondary public entrance and long ago closed off, it has been reopening in stages. The North Vaulted Walkway opened two years ago, entered from a handsome, newly reopened north entrance; the southern portion has now been completed. Capped with a superb Guastavino vault, this axial spine makes the whole lower level accessible and the logic of the whole building easier to grasp.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—European allies are pushing the U.S. to delay its withdrawal from Afghanistan—which U.S. officials had suggested could be complete by as early as July 4—to give NATO allies more time and support to leave, U.S. officials said.<br />In response, U.S. officials said that their departure could be delayed by two weeks or longer to accommodate the allies’ requests. President Biden last month ordered complete pullout by Sept. 11, although military officials have said they could complete the withdrawal by the summer.<br />In another complication, Turkey, which for years has secured the airport in Kabul, has told the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that its troops may leave as well, the officials said. Turkey’s potential departure, after it initially had planned to stay until after the coalition withdrawal, could prompt some Western nations to reconsider plans to keep embassies open in the capital without an international force at Hamid Karzai International Airport, officials said.<br />The new concerns voiced by European allies accentuated the challenge for U.S. officials planning a quick exit from Afghanistan while coordinating with so many partners. The U.S.-led NATO coalition, which accounts for personnel from more than two dozen countries, has long adhered to a pledge of “in together, out together” regarding its presence in Afghanistan<br />If Turkey decides to leave, Western embassies likely will have to review plans to keep even reduced diplomatic contingents in the country. International contractors are one possible alternative for airport security, but are unlikely to be able to stay without troops to guarantee their security.</td>

The mismatch has prompted several states, including Florida, Montana and North Carolina, to tighten reporting requirements to receive unemployment benefits and shut off payments to people who turn down work.<br />In some cases, states are ending access to federal pandemic unemployment payments. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called for an immediate end to a $300-a-week federal jobless supplement. “The disappointing jobs report makes it clear that paying people not to work is dampening what should be a stronger jobs market,” said Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley.<br />President Joe Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen defended the jobs report—which showed that employers added a lower-than-expected 266,000 jobs in April— and said other factors such as health concerns and school closures explained the lackluster jobs report.were keeping people out of the workforce.<br />“I know some employers are having trouble filling jobs. But what this report shows is that there’s a much bigger problem,” Mr. Biden said. “Today’s report just underscores, in my view, how vital the actions we’re taking are: checks to people who are hurting, support for small businesses, for child care and school reopening, support to help families put food on the table,” Mr. Biden said. “Our efforts are starting to work, but the climb is steep and we still have a long way to go.”</td>

      <td>Setting aside one day a week for rest and prayer used to be an American tradition. In an age of constant activity, we need it more than ever.</td>
      <td>In 2019, North Dakota lawmakers abolished their state’s Sunday-trading ban. Going back to the 19th century, business owners had faced jail time and a fine for keeping their doors open Sunday mornings. It was America’s last statewide blue law, and it went the way of the rotary telephone and the airplane smoking section. The bill’s main GOP sponsor in the state legislature claimed that a majority “wants to make decisions for themselves.” Ending the ban, officials argued, would boost shopping and, with it, revenues.<br />Who but a few scolds could complain? The share of Americans who don’t identify with any religion continues to grow, and even many believers reject the concept of the Sabbath as a divinely ordained day of rest. Instead, we are encouraged to pursue lives of constant action and purpose, and we do. Smart devices allow white-collar professionals to freely mingle work and play. The gig economy and the Covid-19 work-from-home trend have further blurred the line between the two. The Sabbath doesn’t fit into the rhythm of our lives. It feels like an imposition—it is an imposition.<br />Americans’ turn away from the Sabbath has been going on for a long time. In the mid-20th century, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, one of America’s foremost Jewish thinkers, wrote about the Sabbath in terms of “the realm of time” and “the realm of space.” Modern life is all about conquering space: winning geopolitical territory, growing and prospering economically. But “the danger begins,” Heschel worried, “when in gaining power in the realm of space we forfeit all aspirations in the realm of time.” In that realm, “the goal is not to have but to be, not to own but to give, not to control but to share, not to subdue but to be in accord.”<br />Many of his American coreligionists in those days saw the ritual as an impediment to freedom: the freedom to shop, work and socialize as much as they wanted. For Heschel, this brand of freedom was missing something profound. It barred entry to an entire dimension of existence: namely, time, whose passage reminds us that everything is contingent, everything passes away—everything, that is, except God. The Sabbath, Heschel thought, is the guarantor of our “inner liberty,” while restless, Sabbath-less societies could easily descend into tyranny and barbarism.<br />He had learned this from bitter experience. Heschel was born in 1907 in czarist-ruled Warsaw, where traditional and modern Jewish currents converged and clashed. He was a prince of the traditional Jewish world, heir to Polish and Lithuanian Hasidic dynasties and formed from an early age to become a rabbi. Thanks to a photographic memory, he excelled at memorizing the Torah, the Jewish prayer book and the foundational medieval commentaries on the Bible.</td>

Now, through expanded adoption of conservation practices, our nation’s farmers have the potential to help reduce global-warming emissions while enhancing crop productivity and profitability.<br />But the biggest obstacle isn’t lack of federal subsidies, it’s too many. Farm bill commodity programs are tied to ownership of land, not implementation of conservation. The federal crop-insurance program charges the same rates for farmers who reduce their risk of loss by adopting conservation practices as it does their neighbors who do not. And “emergency” subsidies for recent hurricanes, Midwestern flooding and bomb cyclone snows came with no requirement that farmers adapt their operations to the new normal of increased weather and market volatility.<br />Congress should make major reforms to agriculture and climate policy. Refocusing spending on conservation adoption can play a role. But real progress on climate takes more than dollars, it also requires change.<br />Joshua Sewell<br />Taxpayers for Common Sense</td>

      <td>Trees share resources through fungi networks, support seedlings and are generous even in death.</td>
      <td>For more than a decade I’ve had Google alerts set up for “fungi” and “mushrooms” and, until recently, most of the articles were about cures for athlete’s foot or recipes like stuffed mushrooms. There were annual notices of forays and festivals, and occasionally a poisoning, usually a curious puppy, sometimes an unfortunate family. But lately interest in fungi has swelled. Mushrooms seem to be the newest health and wellness trend and, judging from my Instagram feed, there’s a whole new crowd of gorgeous young people interested in mycology. These days I’m drowning in alerts about mushroom hunting, medicinal mushrooms, psychedelic mushrooms, fungi in fashion and fungi as a metaphor for the common good.<br />This last notion derives from predominantly 21st-century research showing that the forest is not merely a collection of trees but a community connected by fungi. The idea has captured the imagination of the public, through movies such as “Avatar,” books like Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees” and the mycologist Paul Stamets’s TED talk, “Six Ways That Mushrooms Can Save the World,” which has been viewed almost 10 million times. What all of these ideas have in common is research conducted by a shy Canadian forest ecologist named Suzanne Simard, whose doctoral thesis changed the way we understand the woods.<br />It has long been established that plants trade some of the sugar they make for micronutrients foraged in the soil by fungi, and there had already been some research done that showed the link between fungi and trees. Ms. Simard’s study discovered that fungi in fact attach to the roots of multiple trees of different species, creating pipelines by which a forest community might share nutrients and other molecules and thereby “challenge the prevailing theory that cooperation is of lesser importance than competition in evolution and ecology.”<br />Ms. Simard and her colleagues proved their theory with a simple, well-crafted field experiment: She labeled tree sugars with radioactive isotopes and then tracked them as they traveled through fungal tubes and into the root tips of other trees. Her paper was published in 1997 in the journal Nature and made the cover, beating out the discovery of the fruit-fly genome (more important than it sounds). The editors of Nature called it “the wood-wide web” and today it is shorthand for more than the communication networks of trees and their fungi in a given ecosystem: It has become what Richard Powers calls “the gospel of new forestry” (the character of Patricia Westerford in his novel “The Overstory” is based on Ms. Simard) and a metaphor for cooperation as a means to success and happiness.<br />Ms. Simard tells this story, and the story of her many other surprising discoveries (I stopped counting her scholarly papers at 150) in a vivid and inspiring new memoir, “Finding the Mother Tree: Discovering the Wisdom of the Forest.” Portraying herself here as earnest, hardworking and a sweet-natured cornball, Ms. Simard recounts how she started her career as a researcher at the British Columbia Ministry of Forests. The ministry employed a free-to-grow policy for their pine plantations that eliminated those plants that competed with the young trees for sun and water, like weeding on a forest scale. Yet the pine seedlings failed to thrive. Ms. Simard’s intuition was that the “weed” plants were somehow necessary for the well-being of the seedlings. Exploring that hunch has been her life’s work.</td>

      <td>Bitcoin, dogecoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies are now worth about $2 trillion. But the world of crypto is still small, and stands apart from the rest of the economy.</td>
      <td>“Have fun being poor!”<br />That’s the classic retort to people skeptical about surging cryptocurrencies from those who got in early on the speculative frenzy. It implies, of course, that those early buyers consider themselves rich. But are they really? One way to answer that question is to imagine what would happen if their newfound wealth went “poof,” aside from sparking lots of schadenfreude that is.<br />The price of bitcoin—the most established of the private digital currencies—has risen about 290% over the past six months, but that is nothing compared with some other entrants. Ether, which is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose about 710% during that time. And dogecoin, which was started as a joke, rose about 23,000%.<br />Over that six-month period, the combined value of all cryptocurrencies tracked by coinmarketcap.com—and there are thousands of them—has risen from $427 billion to $2.4 trillion. On the one hand, that is dwarfed by the over $20 trillion in equity Americans have in their homes, or the more than $50 trillion value of the U.S. stock market. On the other, it is approaching the $2.6 trillion that investors around the world have riding on gold.<br />Similar to gold, it is hard to figure out what type of valuation cryptocurrencies should carry. They don’t provide a stream of income like the earnings that stocks generate and they aren’t fundamentally useful in the way that physical commodities such as copper are. Unlike standard currencies, they aren’t backed by any government—a desirable feature in the eyes of many fans.</td>

      <td>G.H. Hardy’s ‘A Mathematician’s Apology’ has been called ‘the best account of what it is like to be a creative artist.’</td>
      <td>The finest reflection on creativity I know of, capturing the magic and transience of its gifts, is not the work of an artist. Its author did not paint, sculpt, write or compose, though he appreciated those who do. He was not of the humanities, nor are his name and achievements much spoken of today. For all that, G.H. Hardy’s “A Mathematician’s Apology,” published in 1940, was, according to Graham Greene, along with Henry James’s exquisite notebooks, “the best account of what it is like to be a creative artist.”<br />Hardy (1877-1947) was born with an uncommon blend of ability and eccentricity, jotting down figures in the millions when he was two years old and amusing himself in church by factorizing the numbers of the hymns. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as an undergraduate in 1896 and, apart from 12 years teaching at New College, Oxford (1919-31), settled there for the rest of his life, specializing in number theory, an exacting branch of mathematics in which, Hardy wrote, “proof really is everything and nothing short of absolute rigour counts.” His “Introduction to the Theory of Numbers” (1938), with E.M. Wright, is now in its sixth edition. At leisure, he read widely, played and followed cricket, enjoying its graceful affinities with his chosen subject, and enlivened college dinners with sparkling conversation. Curiously, this champion of order and reason was wary of the telephone.<br />A pure mathematician, said by peers at Trinity to be the purest of the pure, he was known chiefly for his collaborations with John Littlewood and Srinivasa Ramanujan. (His association with the latter served as the basis for the 2016 Jeremy Irons-led film “The Man Who Knew Infinity.”) Where the applied mathematician fits the facts to our physical reality, Hardy dealt in abstractions. As he illustrates in the “Apology,” the pure geometer proves theorems on his blackboard. When the room’s properties change, the proofs remain unaffected. To imagine otherwise “would be like supposing that a play of Shakespeare is changed when a reader spills his tea over a page. The play is independent of the pages on which it is printed, and ‘pure geometries’ are independent of lecture rooms, or of any other detail of the physical world.” He cherished and—with Littlewood and Ramanujan—touched the boundaries of this imaginary universe. Alas, the connection was fleeting. “Mathematics,” he lamented, “is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon.”<br />Unlike Titian and Goya, Verdi and Strauss, who flourished in old age, in Hardy’s hard-bitten view no mathematician initiated any “major” advance past the age of 50. And so, in 1939, at 62, his most productive years long behind him, he undertook an “Apology”—an apologia, or formal defense, rather than an expression of contrition or regret—for the practice of mathematics and for himself.<br />The mathematician is, to Hardy, no different than the painter or poet—he is “a maker of patterns.” But while “a painter makes patterns with shapes and colours and a poet with words,” those of the mathematician “are made with ideas” or theorems. Their formal appeal was, by Hardy’s admission, difficult to define. Nevertheless, “the mathematician’s patterns, like the painter’s or the poet’s, must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words, must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics.”</td>

      <td>A federal grand jury has indicted Derek Chauvin and three other former Minneapolis police officers on charges of violating George Floyd’s constitutional rights during the May 2020 encounter that killed him.<br />The new indictment unsealed Friday brings the federal government into a case that sparked nationwide protests and bipartisan calls for changes to policing in the U.S.<br />The three-count indictment says Mr. Chauvin, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao willfully violated Mr. Floyd’s rights in the process of arresting him. Mr. Chauvin’s attorney, Eric Nelson, and Mr. Kueng’s attorney, Thomas Plunkett, declined to comment. Lawyers for the other two former officers didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />The Biden Justice Department has placed a priority on prosecuting officers for misconduct and overhauling troubled local police departments as part of a renewed emphasis on civil-rights enforcement. The department is separately investigating whether Minneapolis police engage in patterns of discrimination, excessive force and other unconstitutional conduct, a civil probe that could end in a court settlement forcing changes.<br />The new federal indictments come after a state jury convicted Mr. Chauvin of second-degree murder in April. The other three former officers have been charged at the state level with aiding and abetting Mr. Chauvin and are set to face trial in August. Lawyers for the three former officers have made filings indicating they are not guilty.</td>

      <td>Labor Department says economy added 266,000 jobs in April, well short of what economists had anticipated</td>
      <td>U.S. government bond yields swung sharply Friday after a disappointing jobs report caught traders off guard but didn’t fundamentally change Wall Street’s mostly optimistic outlook on the economic recovery.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell as low as 1.487%, according to Tradeweb, compared with roughly 1.570% just before the report was released and 1.561% Thursday. But it quickly rebounded and ultimately settled at 1.576%.<br />Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, initially slid after the Labor Department said the economy added 266,000 jobs in April, well short of the one million new jobs that economists had anticipated and down from 770,000 jobs added in March.<br />The “report was pretty uniformly disappointing,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. Still, it was “not all that surprising given the fact that economic data in the middle of a pandemic is always difficult to estimate,” he said.<br />After starting the year below 1%, the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to around 1.75% in March, as investors bet that vaccine and government-spending fueled economic rebound would spur inflation above the Federal Reserve’s 2% annual target. Yields have since subsided as investors take a more wait-and-see approach to the recovery.</td>
