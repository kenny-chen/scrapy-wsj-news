      <td>MEXICO CITY—Mexican broadcast and media giant  Grupo Televisa SA B agreed to combine its television content business with Univision Communications Inc., creating a new company that will have SoftBank Group Corp. as an investor, the companies said on Tuesday.<br />The tie-up aims to expand streaming-video services in Spanish-speaking markets and marks a new phase in what has been a hot-and-cold partnership over the years between Televisa, the world’s top producer of Spanish-language television programs, and Univision, the largest U.S. Spanish-language network.<br />The creation of Televisa-Univision, as the new company will be called, comes as broadcasters and cable TV companies struggle with rising competition from streaming services with large budgets for ambitious production of films and series, as viewers get more of their audio, movies and video programming directly over the internet.<br />To boost its war-chest, the new Televisa-Univision, will get a $1 billion equity investment by a consortium led by SoftBank Group and which includes the participation of Google Inc. and The Raine Group.<br />Televisa will receive $3 billion in cash for its assets, plus $1.45 billion in Univision equity. That will be financed by Univision taking on $2.1 billion in debt.</td>

      <td>The judge overseeing the bankrupt Zohar investment funds refused their request to block their founder, turnaround manager Lynn Tilton, from buying one of their portfolio companies in a sale that leaves them with a roughly $150 million loss on loans to the business.<br />Judge Karen Owens of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., approved the sale of Global Automotive Systems LLC for $32 million to an affiliate of Ms. Tilton, giving her control of the auto supplier but leaving little for the Zohar funds that own the company.<br />The judge’s decision overruled the Zohars, which objected to the sale terms. In court papers, the Zohars alleged that Ms. Tilton used her position as a lender to GAS to skew the sale process in her favor, manipulating the company’s finances to make herself the only viable bidder. She denied that, saying her bid was the best available and blamed the Zohars’ “own poor decision-making” in rejecting earlier bids she made.<br />GAS is among the many businesses financed by the Zohars, vehicles Ms. Tilton created to channel investor capital into loans to troubled companies she hoped to improve. Value unlocked from her turnaround efforts were supposed to repay the Zohars and their investors. Many of the businesses in her portfolio have shut down, with or without the benefit of bankruptcy, leaving the Zohars with mounting losses.<br />She placed the Zohars under chapter 11 protection in 2018. Since then, a handful of businesses have been sold in bankruptcy court, at prices that hardly dent the Zohars’ $1.7 billion in debt to their investors.</td>

      <td>The failed unionization push highlights growing disillusionment with progressive priorities.</td>
      <td>The political left has a complicated relationship with its black supporters. When blacks vote to help elect Joe Biden, they are celebrated. When they vote to help undermine the progressive agenda, they are in the way.<br />Smarter Democratic strategists have been warning for some time that the party has been moving steadily to the left of the average black voter on everything from crime and gay rights to school choice and immigration. Progressive politicians and liberal activists may want to ban charter schools, reduce resources for law enforcement and empty out the prisons—“No more policing, incarceration and militarization,” Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib tweeted this week—but polling shows that such ideas have little support among the black rank and file.<br />This growing disconnect between political elites and ordinary blacks was on display again last week when Big Labor’s attempt to organize an Amazon facility in Alabama with a workforce estimated to be 85% black was rebuffed by a vote margin of more than 2 to 1. In what has been described as a major setback for organized labor, 71% of the workers who cast ballots voted against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. The union’s president, Stuart Appelbaum, responded by suggesting the workers had somehow been deceived. “Amazon has left no stone unturned in its efforts to gaslight its own employees,” he told reporters after the vote.<br />The employees themselves offered a different take. They expressed satisfaction with the pay, benefits and working conditions at Amazon and said that paying dues to a union to address any complaints they did have was unnecessary. For years, organized labor has been working to gain a foothold at Amazon, the nation’s second-largest private employer after  Walmart .  These efforts have failed repeatedly, and no wonder. Amazon offers relatively high pay and good benefits. Blacks and Hispanics are 49.3% of its hourly workers and 20% of managers. And Walmart, which has also been fighting off unionization for years, offers competitive salaries and benefits while having a similarly diverse workforce.<br />Nationwide, black unionization rates are slightly higher than those of whites. This is in part because a higher percentage of blacks work in the public sector, where unionization overall is more prevalent than it is in private business. Among private-sector workers, however, black unionization has steadily declined over the decades, just as it has among other groups. And contrary to the suggestion of labor officials like Mr. Applebaum, it’s not because black workers are confused or have been hoodwinked. Rather, they are acting in their own economic interests, and they happen to be in good historical company.</td>

      <td>Admitting our beliefs are false can feel like a failure, a sign of weakness. Instead, we should look at changing our mind as an ‘update.’</td>
      <td>Metaphors carry us from one idea that is difficult to understand to another that is easier to grasp. Many subjects are notoriously incomprehensible, making the use of metaphors essential.<br />The Newtonian “mechanical universe” metaphor, for example, transfers us from the difficult idea of gravity and the spooky notion of action-at-a-distance to the more understandable “clockwork” of gears and wheels. Enlightenment thinkers used the mechanical metaphor to explain everything from the human body (with its levers and pulleys of joints, tendons and muscles) to political systems (the king as the sun, his subjects as encircling planets) and even economies: François Quesnay modeled the French economy after the human body, likening the flow of money through a nation to blood coursing through a body’s veins; he compared ruinous government policies to diseases that impeded economic health, and therefore recommended laissez-faire.<br />The workings of the human mind are especially enigmatic, so scientists have long invoked metaphors such as hydraulic mechanisms, electrical wires, logic circuits, computer networks, software programs and information workspaces to help explain what’s going on. In “The Scout Mindset: Why Some People See Things Clearly and Others Don’t,” Julia Galef, a co-founder of the Center for Applied Rationality and host of the popular podcast “Rationally Speaking,” uses a military metaphor of scouts and soldiers.<br />According to Ms. Galef’s divide, the soldier mindset leads us to defend our beliefs against outside threats, seek out evidence to support our beliefs, ignore or rationalize away counterevidence and resist admitting we’re wrong—as that feels like defeat. The scout mindset, by contrast, seeks to discover what is true through evidence, and reasons toward conclusions that lead to a more accurate map of reality—“the motivation to see things as they are,” Ms. Galef explains, “not as you wish they were.”<br />The differences between these two mindsets are striking and, Ms. Galef argues, explain how thinking goes right or wrong. Soldiers rationalize, deny, deceive and self-deceive, and engage in motivated reasoning and wishful thinking to win the battle of beliefs. “We talk about our beliefs as if they’re military positions, or even fortresses, built to resist attack,” the author writes. This soldier mindset leads us to defend against people who might “ ‘poke holes in’ our logic,” “shoot down” our beliefs or confront us with a “ ‘knock-down’ argument,” all of which may leave our beliefs “undermined,” “weakened” or even “destroyed.” Soldiers thus become “entrenched” in their beliefs, resisting “surrender” to an opposing position.</td>

Its movement may be ocean-liner-like, the news may be five years old before the  New York Times  notices it, but the climate community has been backing away from a worst-case scenario peddled to the public for years as “business as usual.”<br />A drumroll moment was Zeke Hausfather and Glen Peter’s 2020 article in the journal Nature partly headlined: “Stop using the worst-case scenario for climate warming as the most likely outcome.”<br />This followed the 2017 paper by Justin Ritchie and Hadi Dowlatabadiasking why climate scenarios posit implausible increases in coal burning a century from now. And I could go on. Roger Pielke Jr. and colleagues show how the RCP 8.5 scenario was born to give modelers a high-emissions scenario to play with, and how it came to be embraced despite being at odds with every real-world indicator concerning the expected course of future emissions.</td>

      <td>Withdrawing all U.S. troops risks the return of al Qaeda and ISIS.</td>
      <td>The White House announced Tuesday that President Biden plans to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11. The symbolic but arbitrary date shows the decision is driven less by facts on the ground than a political desire that is also a strategic gamble. History suggests U.S. interests will suffer.<br />The target date 20 years to the day after the 9/11 attacks is meant to underscore that at long last the Afghan war will end. But of course it won’t. The country will see its civil war escalate, as the Taliban seek to retake Kabul and reestablish the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. If the country again becomes a sanctuary for al Qaeda and Islamic State, don’t be surprised if U.S. troops have to return as they did in Iraq after Barack Obama’s 2011 withdrawal led to the rise of ISIS.<br />Mr. Biden inherited a bad situation as President Trump had negotiated a May 1 withdrawal date. As the U.S. drew down its forces, the Taliban failed to cut ties with al Qaeda and have captured military bases around the country.<br />Today some 10,000 foreign forces remain, including as many as 3,500 Americans. A U.S. departure means NATO and other partner troops will leave too. The U.S. says it will stay diplomatically engaged, but the withdrawal almost surely means the peace talks between the Taliban and Kabul will fail. The Taliban will feel no pressure to make concessions, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has no reason to negotiate his own execution.<br />Whether the U.S.-backed government can survive is unknowable, though it’s unlikely to have much influence outside Kabul. The Afghan army and police may lose confidence without foreign backing, and the Northern Alliance will reform as protection against the Taliban.</td>

      <td>Soon the biggest barrier to reaching herd Covid-19 immunity will be vaccine fears, not supply. Regulators can sometimes be excessively cautious, but the Biden Administration’s decision to pause  Johnson & Johnson  vaccinations while scientists investigate very rare blood clots in recipients seems reasonable.<br />Media outlets last week began reporting cases of people who had received J&J’s vaccine developing severe blood clots. One recipient died. It’s not known whether the J&J vaccine caused the clots, but fears are magnified amid lack of information—especially after similar rare clots were linked to  AstraZeneca ’s  vaccine. The vaccines use similar technology.<br />In a joint statement Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration said they are reviewing six U.S. cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) that occurred among the 6.8 million who have received J&J’s vaccine. All six were women between ages 18 and 48, and symptoms occurred six to 13 days after vaccination.<br />This particular brain blood clot is extremely rare in the general population—five individuals per million per year, with higher rates among those under the age of 18—and deadly. “Treatment of this specific type of blood clot is different from the treatment that might typically be administered,” the agencies explained. Heparin—the usual clotting treatment—“may be dangerous, and alternative treatments need to be given.” Now doctors are on high alert for such clots and can prepare appropriate treatment.<br />The CDC plans to convene its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Wednesday to “review these cases and assess their potential significance.” This will let scientists examine commonalities among cases and consider if the vaccine shouldn’t be given to certain individuals who may be at higher risk for clots.</td>

Politicians and protesters immediately assumed that racism motivated the shooting, but the facts may prove more complicated, and the rush to judgment doesn’t serve justice.<br />Police say officers pulled Daunte Wright over because of expired registration tags, then discovered an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Wright faced charges for carrying a pistol without a permit and fleeing police, and he failed to show up in court, the Minneapolis Star Tribunereports.<br />Body cam footage shows Wright resisting arrest and trying to get back in his vehicle. “Taser, taser, taser,” shouted an officer later identified as 48-year-old Kim Potter. “Holy s—,” she says seconds later, “I just shot him.” Police Chief Tim Gannon said Monday “it is my belief that the officer had the intention to deploy their Taser but instead shot Mr. Wright with a single bullet” and described the shooting as “accidental.”<br />Ms. Potter and Mr. Gannon resigned Tuesday. The investigation must answer how an officer may have mistaken her gun for a taser, but we’ve seen nothing that suggests racial animus drove Ms. Potter to pull the trigger.<br />Public officials nonetheless rushed to render their verdict. “Now we have another name added to Philando [Castile], Jamar [Clark], George [Floyd], and Daunte will now be added to that,” said Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, referring to other black men killed by police. Vice President Kamala Harris said Monday that Wright “should be alive today," but “folks will keep dying if we don’t fully address racial injustice and inequities in our country, from implicit bias to broken systems.”</td>

      <td>Israel defends itself as Biden courts Tehran to return to the flawed Obama deal.</td>
      <td>‘America is back” has been a mantra of the early Biden Presidency, and back how is the question. So far regarding Iran it seems to mean back to the future of 2015-2016 and another bad nuclear deal.<br />The U.S. on Wednesday will resume talks in Vienna to revive the nuclear agreement, but the bigger news is the explosion over the weekend at Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility. No one has taken credit, but Israel has been notably public in saying it will do whatever it must to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.<br />Unlike past cyber attacks, the U.S. was quick to say it had nothing to do with the Natanz attack. A fair conclusion is that Israel feels it must act because it sees President Biden rushing back to a deal that clearly hasn’t stopped Iran from continuing to make progress toward a nuclear breakout.<br />Washington and Tehran are so far speaking through European intermediaries, but the focus of the talks is also back to the Obama future. The Iranians, who outmaneuvered the same American negotiators six years ago, are demanding the removal of all sanctions as the price for a return to the deal. Donald Trump’s sanctions have increased domestic economic pressure on the mullahs, who want access to global oil markets and investment.<br />Iran has spent two years slowly ramping up its violations of the deal—restricting nuclear inspections, activating advanced centrifuges, enriching uranium at a higher purity and stockpiling more of it. This can be reversed, but the increased nuclear knowhow can’t be undone.</td>

      <td>Five Democratic groups and Pew say they may need to return to old-school polling techniques like knocking on doors</td>
      <td>Self-assessments by two polling groups in recent days conclude that they undercounted Republicans and Trump supporters in 2020 and that there is no firm answer yet for how to fix the problem.<br />The examinations come after many pollsters significantly understated Republican strength in the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, and the findings suggest that a variety of polling methodologies came up short. One report, released Tuesday by five Democratic polling firms, finds that their surveys undercounted voters who viewed former President Donald Trump as “presidential.’’ Another, by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, concluded that obtaining the proper representation of Republicans in surveys has become more difficult.<br />While the reports suggest several possible sources for the underrepresentation of Republicans and Trump supporters, one leading idea from the groups suggests that the problem will be hard to resolve: Even when pollsters in 2020 reached Republican voters or those in GOP-leaning groups, such as white voters without college degrees, those who chose to answer surveys didn’t represent a full range of views. Those who participated in surveys tended to be less supportive of Mr. Trump, while those who declined surveys tended to more firmly back the former president.<br />That finding suggests that pollsters can’t fix their problem merely by including more voters from any one party or demographic group but will have to find new ways to access the hardest-to-reach voters within several demographic groups.<br />Jill Normington, a principal with Normington, Petts & Associates, which participated in the Democratic study, said the five firms concluded that even when a survey sample properly mirrored the characteristics of the U.S. voter pool, “We were getting the wrong people, at the end of the day.’’</td>

During the 1980s, performance meant profitability. If an executive met the quarterly earnings goals, he avoided termination. This focus on short-term performance had its flaws, but at least executives had clear instructions: make money. In today’s environment, executives are expected to make their firms profitable, environmentally friendly and socially responsible—the triple bottom line, a term coined by British management consultant John Elkington in 1994.<br />The triple bottom line has created expectations of executives that aren’t only vague, hard to meet and outside their expertise, but also sometimes incompatible with profitability. If we want a more efficient and less politicized corporate leadership, expectations must be recalibrated. If Americans want workers to be treated well and the environment to be clean, they need effective government regulation of externalities, not baffled CEOs.<br />—Ryan Bernicker, Bucknell University, finance</td>

      <td>Iran will start enriching some of its stock of uranium to 60% for the first time, one of Iran’s leading nuclear negotiators said Tuesday, after an attack on its main nuclear facility.<br />But the country’s negotiators will continue to participate in talks in Vienna on constraining its nuclear activities in return for a reversal of American economic sanctions on Tehran. Former U.S. officials said that Iran’s announcement appeared to be calculated to fortify Iran’s negotiating hand and counter the notion that its nuclear program had suffered a major setback.<br />The comments from Abbas Araghchi, a deputy foreign minister, followed the apparent sabotage of Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility Sunday, which caused an electrical blackout that destroyed a number of centrifuges. Israeli media reported that the attack was carried out by the nation’s Mossad intelligence agency, though Israeli officials declined to comment. Iran has also blamed Israel. The White House has said the U.S. had no involvement in the Natanz attack.<br />“The Iranians believe their nuclear activity provides leverage in the talks,” said Gary Samore, director of the Crown Center for Middle East Studies at Brandeis University and a weapons-of-mass-destruction expert on former President Barack Obama’s National Security Council. “Since some portion of Natanz appears to have been knocked out for some period, that weakens their leverage, and they have compensated by announcing higher enrichment levels.”<br />Mr. Araghchi was in the Austrian capital to attend a second week of negotiations over restoring the 2015 nuclear deal by bringing Iran back into compliance and by removing sanctions that the U.S. imposed after the Trump administration withdrew from the pact in 2018.</td>

Its proposals include requiring every state to offer early in-person voting and voting by mail, loosening requirements for voter ID and creating independent panels to draw voting districts in each state to end partisan gerrymandering.<br />The bill also would restructure the Federal Election Commission in a way that proponents say would make the agency more effective but critics say would turn it into a partisan tool.</td>

      <td>In an engrossing Cold War drama on AMC+, Dominic Cooper stars as an intelligence agent tasked with exposing a leaker within British Sector headquarters.</td>
      <td>‘Can anyone trust anyone?” muses British intelligence agent Fielding Scott, his wonderment coming at a point far enough down the mental alleyways of “Spy City” that the answer is obvious. The location is the postwar, pre-Wall, sectored city of Berlin, circa 1961; the KGB is infesting the woodwork (or at least the light fixtures); Fielding’s boss hates him worse than the Soviets do. And he and his girlfriend go back and forth on whether to assassinate each other. You hope his question is rhetorical, or you would wonder how he’d ever found his way down the Bundesstrasse.<br />“Spy City,” created and written by William Boyd, is a logical progression from his novels of diplomacy and espionage (“A Good Man in Africa,” “Restless”). It takes pains to avoid most of the Ian Fleming echoes of Cold War drama, including the concept of cool. Fielding (Dominic Cooper, “Preacher”) is not classically cool. He’s handsome, capable and dresses well. But he’s shifty. Furtive. He’s the only one on the street wearing sunglasses. You wonder why the Stasi doesn’t spend most of its time asking for his papers. But he’s also been burned: A routine handoff of information in a Berlin men’s room turns into an attempt on his life, and the would-be assassin—upon whom Fielding imposes death-by-urinal—turns out to have a British passport. And friends among Fielding’s superiors. None of them knows, or will admit, what happened. But they do know there’s a spy in the ranks at British Sector headquarters. Fielding, a cloud over his head, is assigned to cork the leak.<br />While that particular effort extends through all six episodes of what is a truly international, multilingual production, there are subplots à go-go. (It is the ’60s, after all.) A German scientist in the Russian sector, code name Beethoven, has a navigation system for intercontinental ballistic missiles that he’d like to bring with him to the West. The Soviets would prefer he stay. Fielding’s nervous assistant, Eliza (Leonie Benesch), works in the British sector but lives in the East and is trying to protect her protest-singer boyfriend, Reinhart (Ben Münchow), who won’t stop performing in democratically inclined coffeehouses. (You rather wish he would.) Fielding’s lover, Severine Bloch (Romane Portail), is a French agent, and the two have a past that isn’t too strenuously explored. But she is allegedly spending her off-hours searching for the Nazi who killed her husband during the earlier unpleasantries. Except that the man she kills isn’t that Nazi. And the one she’s chasing may not exist. She seems awfully young to have been widowed in the ’40s. Maybe she never had a husband at all.<br />Alternatively, everyone might be telling the truth, which is what makes “Spy City” as engrossing as it is. The Cold War, which has been deemed endlessly fascinating to judge by how much small-screen time has been devoted to it over the past few years, is evoked by director Miguel Alexandre partly though the intermittent use of bleached-out period footage of Berlin’s street traffic and colorless architecture. He also reflects Fielding’s existential dilemma—Mr. Cooper does make him complex—by scattering red herrings throughout the proceedings. If the camera lingers on a pair of stiletto heels, shouldn’t some evildoer be gaffed on one by the end of the episode? Not necessarily. When Severine asks Fielding, “Do you trust me again?” following some heinous episode of betrayal, she and the show are really asking the question of us. And our answer is an emphatic “Nein.” Recreational distrust is the stuff of “Spy City,” upon which the Cold War heats up.</td>

      <td>Ohio law prohibits doctors from performing an abortion once a patient reveals she is motivated by fears the fetus has Down syndrome</td>
      <td>A splintered federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld an Ohio law that makes it illegal for a physician to perform an abortion upon learning that the patient wants the procedure because she fears the fetus has Down syndrome.<br />In a 9-7 vote, the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati allowed Ohio to enforce the law, reversing an earlier ruling by a smaller panel of the court.<br />The statute doesn’t prevent women from terminating a fetus diagnosed with Down syndrome. But it prevents a physician from performing the procedure if the pregnant woman tells the doctor she is seeking the abortion because she has reason to believe the fetus has the genetic disorder.<br />The dispute over the law expands a relatively new front in the legal battle over abortion. The Supreme Court has never reviewed the constitutionality of restraints on abortions performed because of predicted characteristics of the fetus, such as disability, race or gender. Tuesday’s ruling marks the first time a federal appellate court has held that a statute like Ohio’s doesn’t violate the right to an abortion.<br />Republican legislators voted for the law, known as H.B. 214, in 2017. Before it could take effect, a federal judge barred the state from enforcing it while the court heard a lawsuit challenging it.</td>

Among major investors here are subsidiaries of  Anglo American  PLC, Newmont Mining Corp. of Denver, and  Aluminum Corporation of China .<br />“We’re often told that only political scientists, constitutionalists, erudite politicians, those with grand degrees can govern a country,” Mr. Castillo told supporters recently. “They’ve had enough time.”<br />Speaking to reporters Tuesday, he said he sees this election as a “competition between the rich and the poor...I see a fight between the boss and the laborer, the master and the slave.”</td>

      <td>After months of deadlock, Iran, the U.S. and the remaining five parties to the 2015 nuclear deal on April 2 agreed to resume negotiations in Vienna to restore the accord. While U.S. and Iranian officials won’t hold direct discussions for now, bringing them to the same gathering in the Austrian capital is a major first step toward salvaging the deal.<br />Iran’s main objective at the talks will be to obtain relief from sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after it withdrew from the deal in 2018. U.S. officials will focus on bringing Iran back into compliance with its commitments in the deal.<br />Iran has in recent months stopped adhering to several key provisions in the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, reducing the time it would need to produce a nuclear weapon. These steps away from the deal, a response to U.S. sanctions, have put at risk the survival of an agreement that helped remove sanctions on Iran and open it to business with the West.<br />Iran on Feb. 23 said it would no longer grant daily access to United Nations inspectors to its nuclear facilities or provide round-the-clock security footage of its activities at these sites. The U.S. and European powers decided on March 3 to give Iran a last chance to start cooperating with the International Atomic Energy Agency’s probe of its nuclear activities, backing away from plans to formally censure Iran in a bid to revive diplomacy between Washington and Tehran.<br />The curbing of nuclear inspections was Iran’s third breach of the agreement since December. It followed a revelation on Feb. 10 by U.N. watchdog the IAEA which told member states in a confidential report that Iran had begun producing uranium metal, a material vital for nuclear weapons. Due to the limited civilian utility of uranium metal, the disclosure stirred concern among Western officials over whether Iran is preparing to restart work toward a nuclear weapon.</td>

      <td>Hospitals in Canada’s most populous province are canceling surgeries, transferring patients and preparing for the possible need to ration care as they face a surge in Covid-19 variants that is putting more pressure on Ontario’s healthcare system than at any other time in recent history.<br />As of Monday, the number of adult Covid-19 patients in intensive-care-unit beds had risen 44% from the beginning of the month to reach 623, according to data compiled by Critical Care Services Ontario. About two-thirds of those patients were on ventilators. Previously, the number of Covid-19 patients in critical-care beds had peaked at 415 in mid-January.<br />“It’s really the battle of a lifetime,” said Anthony Dale, head of the Ontario Hospital Association, an advocacy group for 141 hospitals operating in the province. “I’m quite fearful of what the next several weeks will look like.”<br />The situation in Ontario, where nearly 40% of the Canadian population lives, stands in contrast to that in many U.S. states, where vaccinations have been administered at a faster pace. Canada’s seven-day average of confirmed Covid-19 cases recently eclipsed that of the U.S. on a per-capita basis for the first time since the early days of the pandemic. Hospitals in adjacent New York and Michigan states are also seeing increased Covid-19 hospitalizations, but are under less pressure compared with past waves of infection.<br />The crunch in Canada is due to a surge in new cases of the highly contagious U.K. variant alongside a slow vaccine rollout. Compounding the problem is the province’s low number of acute hospital beds, which have stayed steady over the past two decades despite a growing population.</td>

      <td>“Fortnite” creator Epic Games Inc. is now valued at $28.7 billion after raising more capital, funding that comes just weeks before the videogame company heads to trial against  Apple Inc.<br />Epic on Tuesday said it completed a $1 billion funding round that includes an additional $200 million from  Sony Group Corp.  The company, which also counts  Walt Disney Co.  and China’s  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  among its investors, was valued at $17.3 billion as of last August. Its chief executive, Tim Sweeney, remains the company’s controlling shareholder.<br />“We are grateful to our new and existing investors who support our vision for Epic and the Metaverse,” Mr. Sweeney said in a written statement, referring to the concept of a collective virtual shared space.<br />Epic was founded in 1991. In addition to the shooter game “Fortnite,” it makes the Unreal Engine, a suite of software tools for developing videogames and producing special effects for television shows, movies and other types of digital content. It also owns the video-chat app Houseparty and the studios behind hit games such as “Rocket League’’ and “Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout.”<br />Released in 2017, “Fortnite” quickly became a global cultural phenomenon, especially beloved by teenagers. It is best known for its free “Battle Royale’’ mode, where 100 players duke it out until only one combatant or squad remains. About a year ago, Epic said “Fortnite” had more than 350 million registered accounts.</td>

The Taliban on Monday backed out of peace talks slated to begin this week in Turkey. Mr. Biden is expected to announce Wednesday that the U.S. will withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, officials said, revising a Trump administration plan for a withdrawal by May 1.</td>

      <td>Facebook Inc.  is expanding the authority of its independent oversight board, saying the panel will hear users’ appeals on the content they want removed from the company’s platforms.<br />The social-media giant said Tuesday that over the coming weeks, all users will have the ability to appeal content moderators’ decisions to keep flagged content such as posts, comments, photos and videos on Facebook and Instagram. Previously, people were able to make appeals to the oversight board only for content they wanted restored to those platforms.<br />Board decisions are binding, the company has said.<br />Members of the oversight board have called previously for the company to expand their purview to influence a wider range of thorny content decisions that social-media platforms face. Facebook convened the group—which includes nearly 20 professors, lawyers, and human-rights activists from around the world, among others—to consider cases that have the potential to guide future content decisions and rules. Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of integrity, said in a blog post that the company will work to expand the board’s scope over time.<br />The board made its first rulings in January, with some decisions illustrating a willingness to overturn previous content-moderation decisions. But the panel is slated to make its biggest decision later this month when it determines whether the company erred in suspending former President Donald Trump’s personal Facebook account.</td>

The International Air Transport Association industry body says it has tracked fake certificates in multiple countries, from France to Brazil, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Border control authorities and police forces have also reported arrests of people selling documents in the U.K., Spain, Indonesia and Zimbabwe, among others.<br />The problem is hitting international flights more than domestic ones, which  typically don’t require certification at the moment. Airlines that are more dependent on cross-border travel, particularly those operating in Europe, are growing increasingly alarmed as they look to the summer, when they still hope demand will start to return.<br />The proliferation of fake health certificates is exposing a logistical blind spot, as airlines rush to navigate post-pandemic travel standards and retool their systems to ease compliance—and spur demand. Airlines say their staff aren’t equipped to handle and police all the new health certifications needed and worry the problem will be exacerbated when some countries also start to ask for vaccination certificates.<br />At Brussels Airlines, staff have shared fake certificates that they have come across—including one from an incident last week—to stay abreast of the techniques fraudsters are using.</td>

      <td>In the guise of combating ‘misinformation,’ YouTube again censors scientific debate over pandemic policy.</td>
      <td>I attended a public-policy roundtable hosted by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last month. The point was to discuss the state’s Covid policies in the months ahead. That 600,000 Americans have died with Covid-19 is evidence that the lockdowns over the past year, including significant restrictions on the lives of children, haven’t worked. Florida reopened in May and declined to shut down again. Yet age-adjusted mortality is lower in Florida than in locked-down California, and Florida’s public schools are almost all open, while California’s aren’t.<br />My fellow panelists—Sunetra Gupta of Oxford, Martin Kulldorff of Harvard and Scott Atlas of Stanford—and I discussed a variety of topics. One was the wisdom of requiring children to wear masks. The press asked questions, and a video of the event was posted on YouTube by local media, including Tampa’s WTSP.<br />But last week YouTube removed a recording of this routine policy discussion from its website. The company claimed my fellow panel members and I were trafficking in misinformation. The company said it removed the video “because it included content that contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities regarding the efficacy of masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”<br />Yet the panelists are all experts, and all spoke against requiring children to wear masks. I can’t speak for my counterparts, but my reasoning was a cost-benefit analysis. The benefits of masking children are small to none; the costs are much higher.<br />The scientific evidence is clear. Consider a study from Iceland conducted early in the epidemic when masking was uncommon. The study used a representative sample to track the source of Covid infections. The authors used contact-tracing methods paired with genetic sequencing analysis to establish precisely how the disease spread. The senior author of the study, Kari Stefansson, later told reporters that “even if children do get infected, they are less likely to transmit the disease to others than adults. We have not found a single instance of a child infecting parents.” Many studies in the scientific literature reach a similar conclusion: Even unmasked children pose less of a risk for disease spread than adults.</td>

      <td>Testimony will shed light on Biden’s approach to Russia, China, terrorism and proliferation.</td>
      <td>Top intelligence officials are testifying before Congress Wednesday and Thursday on global threats facing America. Such open sessions, complemented by closed hearings and classified and unclassified written reports, were annual events until President Trump halted them in 2019. He intensely disliked media reporting on testimony about Russian meddling in U.S. elections, reflecting his concern for his personal rather than national interests.<br />These hearings, or any public discussion of intelligence matters, are limited by legitimate concerns for protecting sensitive information and intelligence sources and methods. Even so, open hearings and unclassified reports have proved enormously helpful in public debate. What should this week’s testimony include, and by what standards should it be judged?<br />The principal risk to intelligence integrity is politicization, a charge routinely hurled across the political spectrum. Several new Biden administration officials will testify for the first time this week, so it is timely to stress continued strengthening of the wall between intelligence and policy making. Molding intelligence to fit an administration’s policy preferences is a constant danger, as is arguing that particular intelligence compels a particular policy. The former threat seems easier to spot, but the two are equally pernicious. Only rarely is any intelligence (or information generally, however acquired) such a show stopper that it dictates policy. Data and intelligence analysis or judgments, especially the latter two, don’t end debate but inform it.<br />The hearings’ headline subjects should be China and Russia. How the intelligence leaders handle these strategic threats will speak volumes about their likely future performance. They have the opportunity to provide comprehensive analysis of threats from Beijing and Moscow, similar in some ways to Vice President Mike Pence’s October 2018 speech on China. While we can expect ample commentary on Russian efforts to interfere in U.S. and other Western elections, the sheer scope of China’s efforts to shape U.S. public opinion is of a different order of magnitude, as Mr. Pence made clear. Although it’s politically tempting, witnesses would be wrong to play down Chinese operations in an attempt to score points off Mr. Trump’s unhappiness with discussions of Russian interference. Americans need the fullest possible picture of Beijing’s machinations, especially from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, consistent with classification needs.<br />Moscow’s adventurism in the former Soviet Union is on display as troops mass near Ukraine’s border, and its military presence in the Middle East is growing. Beijing’s expansionism in the South China Sea and elsewhere is also accelerating. Both are major threats in cyberspace. While there are important judgments to be made about Russia’s objectives and capabilities during renegotiation of the New Start Treaty, the intelligence community should also discuss the threats posed by China’s expanding nuclear program. The sheer scope of Chinese and Russian military activity, across all war-fighting domains, hardly figured in the 2020 presidential campaign, and needs underlining now. The intelligence leaders have much to warn about.</td>

      <td>New discoveries about an elementary particle could lead to a ‘gold rush’ of new physics.</td>
      <td>Nobel Prize-winning physicist Frank Wilczek explores the secrets of the cosmos. Read previous columns here.<br />On April 7, the physics world was startled into glorious confusion by two announcements of a new measurement and a new calculation of the magnetic moment of the muon, published in the journals Physical Review Letters and Nature. The new results, accurate to the level of one part per billion, are the product of multiyear collaborations by large groups of physicists at institutions around the world. You might think that the work of making such precise measurements and calculations is as dull as science gets, but it can make magic happen.<br />Muons are elementary particles that in several fundamental ways resemble the more familiar electrons; for example, both carry exactly the same amount of electric charge. But there are two big differences: Muons are roughly 200 times heavier than electrons, and they are unstable, with a mean lifetime of roughly two microseconds.<br />As exotic particles go, muons are uncommonly user-friendly. They are easy to produce in large numbers at high-energy accelerators. And though a microsecond may not sound like a long time, fast-moving muons can travel a long way before they expire, leaving easily detectable tracks. Though it’s often taken for granted, the fact that we can talk about “the” mass and “the” magnetic moment of the muon, when in practice we sample millions of different particles, is both profound and amazing. Precision measurements so far reinforce our confidence that all muons, like all electrons, have exactly the same properties.<br />Muons are forever rotating—as physicists say, they have “spin”—which is key to many aspects of their behavior. If a muon is exposed to a magnetic field, its rotation axis circles around that field’s direction, similarly to how the axis of a tilted, spinning top circles around the vertical. This top-like motion is called precession. The rate of a muon’s precession in a magnetic field is equal to the product of the strength of the magnetic field, some known physical constants and a number called the magnetic moment.</td>

      <td>Raise your hand if you remember what prices looked like one year ago.<br />It is a hard thing to recall, since a year ago was when the novel coronavirus epidemic in the U.S. was entering some of its deadliest days, and people were mostly cooped up at home. What does gasoline cost when you aren’t driving? How much did a meal cost at the restaurant that was closed?<br />Though many Americans might not have been registering what many things outside of hard-to-find toilet-paper rolls cost, the Labor Department’s statistical bureau was keeping track. Its inflation reports showed that consumer prices slipped in March last year from a month earlier, and then continued to fall over the following two months. With the March inflation report released on Tuesday, those reports are now hitting their anniversary.<br />The report showed that overall consumer prices rose by 0.6% from February, pushed up by higher fuel prices, and were 2.6% above their year-earlier level. That marked the largest year-over-year gain since August 2018. Prices excluding food and energy items—the so-called core that economists use to better track inflation’s trend—were up a milder 0.3% on the month and 1.6% on the year.<br />On a year-over-year basis, both overall and core inflation should accelerate in the months ahead as a result of that drop in prices last spring. Commentators have been urging people to ignore the jump in inflation readings that result, but that might be sort of beside the point, since again, a lot of people probably can’t remember what they were paying for stuff when the Covid-19 crisis struck.</td>

Outright lies don’t further public debate, and vigorous debate is what the Supreme Court thought it was protecting. Mr. Lewin doesn’t mention what has always seemed to me to be the most significant way that Times v. Sullivan has negatively affected political discourse: Good people are less inclined to enter the public arena.

As you note, defamation cases by public figures against the press are nearly impossible to win due to the “actual malice” standard, an unusual characteristic for democratic countries. Even for public officials, the odds are against winning. If Sullivan can’t be reversed, then limiting its scope to officials, as Prof. Reynolds suggests, would significantly improve the moral and intellectual quality of political life in this country and strengthen democracy.</td>

      <td>The record of sharply reduced refugee admissions over President Trump’s entire term is beyond dispute.</td>
      <td>In his April 10 op-ed (“Must the Supreme Court Create a Trustworthy Press?”) Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. criticizes my reporting on Obama and Trump refugee policies but gets his facts wrong. Mr. Jenkins argues that, in comparing the Trump and Obama records on refugee admissions, I should have used the 2019 figures to avoid any distortion due to the pandemic. That year, he claims, the Trump administration admitted 92,623 refugees, “a number the Obama team never approached in its best year.”<br />In fact, the Trump administration admitted only 29,916 refugees in 2019, barely half the number the Obama administration admitted in 2011, the year of fewest admissions under President Obama.<br />Mr. Jenkins arrives at his numbers by conflating admitted refugees with those asylum applicants who were found to have a credible fear of persecution. Asylum is granted to people who present themselves at a U.S. border or are already in the country. Under U.S. and international law, the U.S. is legally obligated to grant asylum if an individual is found to have a “well-founded fear of persecution.” Refugees constitute an entirely separate category. They apply for protection while they are still outside the U.S. and are granted admission only at the discretion of the U.S. government. Those who are selected for admission to the U.S. get resettled and are given legal residence through a formal program overseen by the State Department. President Trump repeatedly made clear his displeasure with the refugee resettlement program and drastically lowered the refugee admission ceilings during his years in office.<br />It is true that refugee admissions in 2020 were depressed further as a result of the pandemic, but the record of sharply reduced admissions over Mr. Trump’s entire term is beyond dispute.<br />Tom Gjelten</td>

About 6.7 million people have received the vaccine so far in the U.S. J&J shares traded lower on Tuesday morning, while other vaccine makers such as  Moderna  rallied.<br />While the headline is scary, especially in a pandemic setting, there is no direct evidence that the vaccine is responsible for these rare cases.

Regulators are historically quite sensitive to safety issues in vaccines, because they are meant for the entire public. In a nonpandemic setting, several years of safety data is typically collected before bringing a vaccine to market. No surprise then that regulators chose to err on the side of caution. For members of the public who are hesitant to take a vaccine, Tuesday’s action should boost confidence, not erode it.<br />It is possible that the regulators will allow J&J shots to resume in short order. But if not, the U.S. government has diversified its vaccine options, a decision that is looking increasingly prescient. As such, there is plenty of supply even if the J&J vaccine is mothballed over the long term. There were roughly 39 million doses of  Pfizer ’s  and Moderna’s vaccines delivered to care providers but yet to be administered as of Tuesday, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, and more supply is coming online.<br />There will be new challenges if the J&J vaccine doesn’t rejoin the mix. It requires only one dose, while Pfizer and Moderna each require two. If the J&J shot is no longer an option, the government will need to rethink how to supply rural and other hard-to-reach communities with vaccines.</td>

      <td>After more than a year of pandemic uncertainty, many of us are looking for new ways to relieve stress, and spring is especially ripe for new approaches.<br />Self-care doesn’t have to mean spa appointments and expensive vacations. It can be small blocks of time—as little as five minutes—spent clearing your head. As the seasons shift, experts say now is a good time to observe changes in nature and take in sunshine as a way to renew. Breaks that fit into the day—between calls, meetings or school pickups—act as “pressure-release valves,” says Mayo Clinic psychologist Craig Sawchuk.<br />“Think of a salad bar of different things you could do,” he says—whether taking a walk, reading for enjoyment, or making a great cup of coffee—to take a break.<br />Here are a few ideas:<br />Get some outdoor work done by pulling weeds, potting herbs or planting window boxes. “It doesn’t necessarily have to take a lot of effort,” says Charlie Hall, a horticulture professor at Texas A&M University. Dr. Hall’s analysis of more than 2,000 studies—albeit small ones usually with 50 subjects or fewer—showed that gardening or being around plants often has physical and psychological benefits.</td>

Speech-recognition software like that developed by Nuance is emerging as an important new opportunity in medicine as doctors seek to speed up documentation of patient work with dictation rather than getting bogged down taking notes, executives said.<br />“This coming together is about empowering healthcare,” Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, said in an investor call. “It’s now very clear that healthcare organizations that accelerate their digital investments can improve patient outcomes and reduce cost at scale.”<br />The pandemic helped showcase healthcare’s potential as a growth area for tech companies, such as the boom in telehealth services. Microsoft will have an ability to use Nuance as a means to sell healthcare customers its more lucrative products and services, such as cloud-computing, analysts said.<br />“The pandemic response by the healthcare industry has proven the value of technology to healthcare delivery,” said Gregg Pessin, a senior research director at Gartner Inc. “All the digital giants are paying attention.”</td>

Since filing for bankruptcy last year, the Boy Scouts have favored a broad deal between abuse victims and local councils, which are tied to the institution but aren’t themselves in bankruptcy.<br />That remains on the table, Boy Scouts lawyer Jessica Lauria said in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. But if the preferred plan falls to gain traction among victims or can’t clear bankruptcy court, the Boy Scouts would pivot to an alternative version that only covers the national organization, she said.<br />In that scenario, local councils in California, New Jersey, New York and other states would be exposed to the kind of legal action that the Boy Scouts had filed for bankruptcy to resolve.</td>

Some are dreading or altogether rejecting the idea of going back to pumps after months in house shoes, sneakers and flats. Others can’t wait to get dressed up again and wear their favorite heels, discomfort be damned.<br />Sales of high-heeled shoes fell 45% in 2020, according to market researcher NPD Group, as women had nowhere to wear them. Beth Goldstein, the firm’s industry analyst for accessories and footwear, predicts sales will rise this year, but only modestly, as more women, feeling liberated from the tyranny of heels, stick with more comfortable footwear.<br />Many women had already been moving away from heels pre-Covid with the growing casual-fashion trend. The pandemic accelerated that shift. Brands famous for stilettos and pumps, such as Christian Louboutin and Stuart Weitzman, have been promoting more flats, loafers, sandals and sneakers on their Instagram accounts.</td>

So we will continue negotiations on compensation,” said Ryu Murakoshi, a spokesman for the company. He declined to disclose the amount under discussion.<br />Osama Rabie, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, told state-run television Monday that it was demanding payment for the costs of the rescue operation, damages to the banks of the canal and lost revenues. The court order for the seizure claimed the ship’s owners failed to pay $900 million, according to Egyptian state media.<br />“They don’t want to pay anything,” Mr. Rabie said of the Japanese owners.

      <td>Despite Beijing’s rhetorical emphasis on new industries and self-reliance, housing and exports continue to drive China’s recovery</td>
      <td>The world’s second-largest economy kept chugging along in early 2021 with the help of some familiar drivers: housing and exports. A dip in the latter last month will probably prove temporary. But increasing regulatory ire could weigh on China’s housing market—and industrial metal prices—in the second half. Aside from housing, durable signs of strong domestic demand remain relatively scarce.<br />Exports grew an impressive 30.6% in March from a year earlier, data released Tuesday showed. But the year-on-year data is misleading. Goldman Sachs estimates exports contracted a seasonally adjusted 6.6% month-on-month in March compared with an 8.5% rise for January and February combined.<br />The blip in exports was expected: The nation’s February purchasing managers index showed new export orders falling for the first time since last August. The factors behind that were probably temporary, however, including seasonal weakness related to the Lunar New Year and weakening import demand from the U.S. as American industrial output finally showed signs of catching up with domestic demand in early 2021.<br />And China’s March PMI showed new export orders expanding again. With the U.S. now unleashing another big fiscal stimulus, goods demand in America seems likely to keep outpacing supply for quite some time. Chinese exports will probably bounce back.<br />Chinese domestic demand, meanwhile, looks quite solid—but still remains heavily tilted towards housing and construction, to the chagrin of policy makers who have been trying to tighten the screws on real-estate developers and redirect credit into more productive uses. Import volumes rose month on month, but most growth was driven by industrial commodities, notes Capital Economics, suggesting a pick-up in heavy industry and construction. Meanwhile overall credit growth weakened again in March, but lending to households—traditionally dominated by mortgage lending—is still up sharply over the past several months. And house price growth is accelerating: Prices across 70 cities rose 0.4% on average month-over-month in February, the fastest pace since last August.</td>

Ant, an affiliate of  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , will be subject to regulations similar to those governing banks, which will curtail some of its growth prospects.<br />Ant’s mobile payments and lifestyle app Alipay, which has more than one billion users in China, has in recent years sought to generate bigger profits from its customers by directing them toward other financial services such as online loans and a giant money-market mutual fund where they can park their money. In the year to June 2020, Ant reported profit of $5.8 billion on revenue of $21.5 billion.<br />Half a billion Chinese citizens used Ant’s microlending services in the year to June 2020, and they had the equivalent of more than $264 billion in outstanding loans at that point. And at the end of last year, more than 690 million people—or close to half of China’s population—were invested in Ant’s flagship money-market mutual fund, which had $182 billion in assets under management.</td>

This approach can help the hesitant begin writing and break the rut that experienced journal writers can experience when they revisit the same things over and over, she says.<br />“Journaling can be an excavation if you let it, it’s getting to the root of the root of what’s really going on with you and what is really the problem,” Ms. Zielin says.<br />Below, she describes the benefits of writing about yourself in the third person and how 10 minutes a day of journaling can be enough. Edited excerpts:<br />Why and how should someone start journaling?<br />Journaling is really, really good for us. It’s a tool for self-reflection and there are many studies that show it is good for our physical and mental health. I teach my own method but there’s no wrong way to journal. What makes journaling most effective is this idea of welcoming stillness and reflection. Where we get stuck is that in our culture everything is screaming at us to not stop.</td>

The negotiations are being brokered by the U.S. as part of attempts to withdraw American troops from its longest war.<br />The talks have since stalled. In April, the Taliban threw up a new obstacle to the process, saying it wouldn’t participate in a U.S.-backed peace summit in Istanbul slated for on April 16. The Biden administration had hoped the Istanbul meeting would accelerate the negotiations and help compel the two parties to agree to a ceasefire that would allow for a U.S. withdrawal.<br />The Afghan war started in 2001, when the U.S.-led coalition invaded Afghanistan in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The invasion toppled the Taliban rule, which hosted al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the attack.<br />The peace talks aim to bring peace to a country that has suffered four decades of bloodshed. Before the 2001 invasion, Afghanistan endured an armed struggle against Soviet occupation in the 1980s, civil war and an oppressive Taliban rule.<br />The talks follow a conditional agreement struck in February 2020 between the Taliban and the Trump administration, which involved a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops within 14 months in return for guarantees that the Islamist movement would prevent al Qaeda and other terrorists from operating in areas under its control. That deadline is fast approaching. President Biden has said keeping the May 1 deadline will be difficult.

Chinese demand has also remained resilient in recent months, OPEC said.<br />Oil prices rose Tuesday, with Brent crude oil—the global benchmark—up 1.1% at $63.96 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. benchmark, climbing 1% to $60.27 a barrel. Upbeat Chinese economic data gave oil a boost early Tuesday, according to Helge André Martinsen, senior oil market analyst at DNB Markets.<br />OPEC and its allies agreed earlier this month to boost their collective output by more than two million barrels a day over the coming months, betting on resurgent demand as they and the rest of the world assess the economic consequences of the pandemic’s trajectory.</td>

The brutal suppression has hobbled mass demonstrations that swept across the country after the coup.<br />A small but growing contingent no longer believes peaceful resistance is tenable, and they are turning to the many armed groups in the nation’s borderlands for help.<br />These groups belong to Myanmar’s ethnic minorities and have fought the military in long-running civil wars in their quest for greater autonomy. Some have now voiced support for the movement seeking to restore elected government, despite an uneasy relationship before the coup when they saw the civilian leadership as unresponsive to their concerns.</td>

      <td>The recovery in oil prices over the past year has eased financial pressures on big producers, but not strategic ones. They are still working out how to adjust their portfolios to a lower-carbon future.<br />Saudi Aramco’s agreement to sell 49% of its pipelines business to a U.S.-led consortium, announced late last week, points in one direction: Oil companies can sell conventional assets. Midsize European producers  Repsol  and  Eni  are considering whether to pursue minority initial public offerings including their green-energy divisions, indicating another route.<br />Europe’s supermajors,  BP ,   Shell  and TotalEnergies, each plan to spend billions of dollars annually to build lower-carbon energy businesses. But green energy will remain a small part of their massive operations for years, making up little more than a tenth of earnings by 2030, estimates Kim Fustier, an oil analyst at HSBC.<br />The slow shift from black to green has scared away some traditional oil investors while failing to attract ESG investors that focus on environmental, social and governance criteria. European utilities faced a similar challenge when shifting from coal to renewables: They were only seen as “part of the solution” when about a quarter of their earnings came from clean energy, says Ms. Fustier. For the big oil companies, a more palatable portfolio mix is many years away, leaving them stuck in a no-man’s-land.<br />One solution could be to create separate corporate identities. Green-energy assets trade at a big premium to the oil majors. Repsol and Eni are both considering capturing some of that greenium, which would lower their cost of capital, by selling minority stakes in newly listed retail and renewables divisions this year or next.</td>

      <td>Grab Holdings Inc. said it would go public on the  Nasdaq Stock Market  by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company, securing a near-$40 billion valuation in a new milestone for the SPAC boom that has swept U.S. financial markets.<br />The $39.6 billion deal to list Grab, a ride-hailing, food-delivery and digital-wallet group that operates across much of Southeast Asia, is by far the biggest involving a blank-check company and means Grab’s valuation has more than doubled in just 18 months. The merger also comes alongside a $4 billion-plus fundraising, which is the largest-ever share sale by a Southeast Asian company in the U.S.<br />Singapore-headquartered Grab said Tuesday it would merge with  Altimeter Growth Corp. , a SPAC sponsored by Altimeter Capital, of Menlo Park, Calif., confirming details reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The Grab merger adds to a frenzy of SPAC-related deal making. A record $99 billion has been raised in the U.S. by a total of 306 SPACs this year, according to SPAC Research data, and some 435 of these vehicles are still seeking a merger target.<br />As part of the deal, more than $4 billion has been committed in a so-called PIPE, a type of funding round that typically accompanies such mergers with blank-check companies. PIPE stands for “private investment in public equity.” Grab will receive a maximum of about $4.5 billion in cash from the transaction.</td>

Futures on the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 ticked down 0.1%.<br />Investors in both stocks and bonds are seeking to assess whether the projected U.S. economic recovery will trigger a sharp rise in inflation that may remain for a protracted period. Policy makers have repeatedly said they expect any increase over the next few months will prove to be fleeting.

      <td>Higher corporate tax rates will hit banks squarely, but the Biden Administration’s other priorities, like infrastructure and housing, could help lessen the blow</td>
      <td>Banks are squarely in line to feel higher corporate tax rates. But they might get some pretty attractive offsets as well from the whole package.<br />Among big companies, banks typically pay a relatively high effective tax rate, in part because they tend to generate a lot of their income in the U.S. So the Biden administration’s proposed jump from a 21% corporate tax rate to 28% would in theory translate into a roughly 6% hit to earnings per share for large banks, versus 5% for the S&P 500 broadly, according to analyst Brian Foran at Autonomous Research.<br />Even if investors are betting that buybacks and reserve releases will boost banks’ bottom line, higher taxes could reduce the value of banks’ earning power. But there are a few factors investors should consider. For one, banks may not be quite so hard hit, at least relatively speaking, as other sectors, like tech, which could face a new minimum levy on their foreign earnings.<br />Moreover, the Biden administration’s proposal to raise tax rates is part of a broader push in U.S. infrastructure, housing and energy. And those particular things could provide some tax-advantaged outlets for banks, partially offsetting the headline rate increase. For example, banks reduced their share of the municipal securities market after the 2017 tax package. U.S. bank holdings of munis as assets dropped from almost $575 billion at the end of 2017 to around $510 billion at the end of last year, according to Federal Reserve figures. Mr. Foran calculates that among six big regional banks, including  Fifth Third Bancorp  and  Regions Financial ,  tax-advantaged interest and income as a percentage of all pretax income for the group was roughly cut in half, from about 2% to 1%, from 2016 to 2019.<br />Not only does the tax-protected interest income on munis become more attractive at a higher corporate rate, but the muni market could expand should there be a major infrastructure push that leans on such financing.  Bank of America  analysts recently said they anticipate a “golden decade” for muni issuers driven by policy and tax rates.</td>

      <td>Chipmaker’s move into data-center CPU market raises competitive profile but complicates Arm Holdings deal</td>
      <td>In one stroke Monday,  Nvidia  showed why it is a force to be reckoned with in semiconductors—and why its most ambitious deal to date will be a stretch.<br />As part of its annual GTC technology conference, Nvidia announced a new central processing chip, or CPU, called Grace, designed for use in data centers. These are different from the graphics processors the company sells for use in both videogames and data centers. As a CPU, Grace would effectively compete for the data-center slots mostly occupied by chips from  Intel Corp.  and Advanced Micro Devices.<br />Hence, news of Nvidia’s entry into the data-center CPU market drove the stocks of both Intel and AMD down 4% to 5% Monday, while Nvidia’s own shares rose nearly 6% by the closing bell. Nvidia’s uptick was also helped by the company’s later announcement that revenue for the first fiscal quarter ending May 2 is tracking above the forecast given on its last earnings call in February. That forecast projected total growth of 72%, so the update indicates Nvidia hasn’t been hamstrung by the bruising chip production shortage spanning several other markets across the globe.<br />By comparison, the Grace CPU won’t be affecting sales for a long while. Nvidia doesn’t even expect to begin shipping the chip until sometime in 2023, and the company said Monday that the high-powered processor would serve only a niche segment of the market. But the prospect still makes Intel and AMD investors nervous—and rightly so. Nvidia’s graphics chips are a major component in state-of-the-art data centers, given their prowess at artificial intelligence applications. That segment now generates nearly $7 billion a year in revenue for the company, compared with just $339 million five years prior. Wall Street has responded by making Nvidia the second-most-valuable company in the chip space globally, with a market value more than 40% above that of the much larger Intel.<br />But as Nvidia scales up its ambitions, it will run into more resistance than just its longtime competitors. The Grace chip is based on basic designs from Arm Holdings, the British semiconductor-licensing giant Nvidia is acquiring from SoftBank. That deal was already controversial, as Arm licenses chip designs to nearly all of Nvidia’s competitors—and some of its biggest customers as well.  Amazon  has its own in-house Arm-based processor called Graviton that is powering a growing volume of workloads at its AWS cloud computing business. Mark Lipacis of Jefferies estimates that Graviton now accounts for about 18% of so-called CPU instances at AWS.</td>

Whether this rise proves temporary is one of the key questions for markets and the U.S. recovery over the next year or so, as the Biden administration, Congress and the Federal Reserve continue to provide financial support for the economy.</td>

Its Gap contract is scheduled to end in April 2022, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Gap marks the second major loss for Synchrony in recent years.

The Gap portfolio accounts for about 5% of Synchrony’s $78 billion in total balances.<br />Barclays has been looking to expand beyond the airline, hotel and cruise line credit cards that dominate its U.S. portfolio. The Gap account is appealing because it includes many creditworthy cardholders. Some of the cards, in particular those issued to Athleta and Banana Republic customers, tend to attract more affluent borrowers, according to people familiar with the matter. Slightly more than five million of the roughly 11 million total Gap accounts are used at least once a month, one of the people said.</td>

At the Brooklyn Center Police Department, about 2 miles away, protesters shouted and banged drums, chanting, “No justice, no peace” and “Our streets, our streets.” Others chanted Mr. Wright’s name. Some threw water bottles at police and set off fireworks. Windows at a Dollar Tree store across the street were broken and the store was looted.<br />Police said protesters were violating curfew and lobbed chemicals at the crowd. Fences and jersey barriers surround the department.</td>

Mr. Cohen, 35 years old, isn’t planning on taking the role, the person said. Reuters earlier reported on GameStop’s plans to replace Mr. Sherman.<br />At least three top lieutenants of Mr. Sherman have left the company or announced plans to depart within the past few months. The Wall Street Journal reported in February that former finance chief Jim Bellwas forced out of his role, while customer chief Frank Hamlin resigned last month. GameStop has said merchandising chief Chris Homeister is resigning because of diminished responsibilities and will leave during the company’s fiscal second quarter.<br />GameStop has said its board is evaluating the skills of its leadership team and hired a third-party firm to help it in the process.</td>

He called the water release a practical solution and said the government would “ensure safety far in excess of standards.”<br />Representatives of the fishing industry expressed concern about the reputation of seafood caught near Fukushima. “It is nearly certain that there will be damage from rumors,” said Hiroshi Kishi, head of the national fisheries cooperative group, after meeting Mr. Suga on April 7 to discuss the plans.</td>

      <td>Blank-check companies may have to reclassify the instruments as liabilities, SEC says</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Some special-purpose acquisition companies have improperly accounted for warrants sold or given to investors, securities regulators said Monday, stepping up scrutiny of the popular vehicles.<br />Warrants are a standard part of how SPACs raise money, including from hedge funds and other private investors. The potential return for early investors in SPACs is huge if the company’s shares rise because of various features of the structure, including warrants that give some investors the right to buy more shares at a preset price in the future.<br />SPACs are blank-check companies that raise money from the public with a goal of buying a business and taking it public. If the deal happens, the target company takes the SPAC’s place on a stock exchange, in a transaction that resembles an initial public offering. SPACs have boomed over the past year as many deal makers rushed to start them and take advantage of investors’ thirst for the structure.<br />SPACs have typically classified the warrants on their balance sheets as equity. Under certain circumstances, they should be classified as liabilities, which would require the company to periodically account for changes in the warrants’ value, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement released late Monday. One impact of the SEC’s announcement: SPACs that are affected would have to restate their financial results if the fluctuations are deemed to be material, the SEC said.<br />The Wall Street watchdog has started examining the market more closely as SPACs proliferated this year, raising nearly $100 billion. A senior SEC official said last week that SPACs might not have any regulatory advantages over the standard public offering, signaling the agency would scrutinize the failings the same way they do IPOs.</td>

Because anything that was there, man, animal, anything…they are gone.”<br />So far, there are no reports of deaths or injuries. Some 16,000 residents near the volcano were evacuated a day before the eruptions began, as scientists grew concerned about growing activity on the volcano, which killed an estimated 1,600 people during a violent 1902 eruption. But an unknown number of residents have declined to be moved, according to island officials.<br />The explosions at the 3,864 foot volcano could continue for days or weeks, according to the UWI Seismic Research Centre.</td>

      <td>Candidate Joe Biden emphatically denied that he supported the Green New Deal. As with so much else, President Biden is now a convert. His $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan contains enough spending and industrial planning that it amounts to the Green New Deal in disguise.<br />Listen to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who two weeks ago claimed maternity for the President’s plan. “As much as I think some parts of the party try to avoid saying ‘Green New Deal’ and really dance around and try to not use that term, ultimately, the framework I think has been adopted,” the progressive heroine from Queens boasted. The details prove her point.<br />Mr. Biden is pitching his plan as having a big economic return on federal investment—and better roads, bridges and ports could increase productivity. But more than half of his plan is dedicated to reducing CO2, with a goal of eliminating fossil fuels with a mix of federal spending, subsidies and regulation. This is a political project with suspect returns.<br />• Start with $213 billion to build and retrofit two million energy-efficient homes and buildings. These putative “upgrades” would be financed by federal grants, tax credits and the economically inefficient Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).<br />A 2018 study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics of the WAP in Michigan found that its upfront investment costs are about twice the actual energy savings. “Even when accounting for the broader societal benefits derived from emissions reductions, the costs still substantially outweigh the benefits; the average rate of return is approximately −7.8% annually,” the study found.</td>

An invasion to grab more Ukrainian territory is also possible. The U.S. Navy has dispatched two ships to the region.<br />On Monday the U.S. also joined the other G-7 foreign ministers asking Mr. Putin to cease and desist: “These large-scale troop movements, without prior notification, represent threatening and destabilizing activities. We call on Russia to cease its provocations and to immediately de-escalate tensions in line with its international obligations.”<br />Mr. Putin has never been one for “international obligations,” so don’t expect the G-7 to scare him—even when the foreign ministers also demand, as they did, that he follow “the procedure established under Chapter III of the Vienna Document.” International law: Such a lovely fiction.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken was somewhat more forceful Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press”: “So the question is: Is Russia going to continue to act aggressively and recklessly?

Mr. Chauvin, 45, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter.<br />Prosecutors are expected to formally rest their case on Tuesday, a spokesman said. Eric Nelson, Mr. Chauvin’s attorney, will then try to raise reasonable doubt in the jurors’ minds, presenting evidence that he has said will show that Mr. Floyd died of a drug overdose and a heart condition.<br />Judge Peter Cahill said he expected closing arguments would begin on Monday.<br />In the final day of prosecution testimony, the team led by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison touched on the two main pillars of its case. A cardiologist said Mr. Floyd died of a lack of oxygen, and used the video and medical evidence to rule out other factors, including his drug use or a heart attack. A law professor who studies police use of force testified that Mr. Chauvin faced a limited threat from the handcuffed Mr. Floyd that fell to zero after he stopped breathing even as Mr. Chauvin continued a dangerous type of restraint.</td>

      <td>Most fights in one-party states are internecine. In Illinois, the Democrats who control Springfield have all but declared war on Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who is trying to prevent her city’s further decline.<br />The Chicago Teachers Union is threatening to walk out—again—over the school district’s plan to reopen high schools next week. “Critical sticking points include accommodations, high school schedules that minimize virus transmission, remote work—particularly since the majority of students will remain remote—and vaccines for high school students and their family members,” the union said Monday.<br />The union would rather not reopen at all this school year. And thanks to legislation signed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker, the district can’t require it. The statute repeals part of an Illinois law that had restricted the teachers’ right to strike over subjects other than wages and benefits.<br />Now teachers can walk out over schedules, remote learning or even child-care subsidies. While the union fought reopening elementary and middle schools earlier this spring, teachers risked having their pay docked if they struck. Now if the district pushes to reopen high schools, the union can call a strike with impunity and shut down all schools.<br />Ms. Lightfoot strongly opposed the bill. “Now is not the time to change the rules of engagement,” she wrote to legislators. “CPS and CTU agreed on a 5-year contract in 2019. It would be unprecedented for the General Assembly to make substantial changes to the bargaining relationship during the terms of this agreement.”</td>

      <td>New York could replicate Success Academy’s winning model, but standing up to the bureaucracy will take courage.</td>
      <td>New York<br />It would be comic if it weren’t so tragic. A 2019 University of California, Los Angeles study awarded New York City’s public schools first place in segregating black students and second in segregating Latino students. How is this possible? How could the schools in a city dominated by the left and led by Mayor Bill de Blasio, a progressive standard-bearer, be more segregated than those in states where Jim Crow laws once reigned and Confederate monuments still stand?<br />The answer isn’t that New Yorkers are especially prejudiced but rather that we have a shortage of good schools. At most of the city’s public schools, a majority of students either aren’t proficient in reading and math or fail to graduate with the skills necessary to succeed in college. Understandably reluctant to send their children to such schools, affluent families find better options either by moving to neighborhoods zoned for excellent schools or paying to prepare their children for admissions tests at selective schools. And this results in segregation since these affluent families are disproportionately white.<br />Predictably, Mayor de Blasio’s solution is redistribution: Spots at good schools must be redistributed from the “haves” to the “have nots” by using new admissions criteria reverse-engineered to produce the required result. What this ignores is the supply problem. If you don’t create additional good schools, restricting access to the existing ones will merely force well-off families out of the public school system altogether.<br />The challenge is that New York’s pre-K programs are weak, so children enter school with wildly varying levels of academic preparedness. This makes it hard to create racially and economically diverse schools that meet the needs of all students. But it’s not impossible. I know because I’ve done it many times over.</td>

      <td>His definition of the term  is not what the American people think it means.</td>
      <td>During his Monday Oval Office meeting with Republican lawmakers to seek GOP support for his $2 trillion infrastructure bill, Joe Biden pushed back on the idea that the meeting was no more than bipartisan “window dressing.” The president calls his plan “a historic investment” that will redress America’s “crumbling infrastructure” and says he’s willing to negotiate. But a recent slip by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg reveals that what the Biden administration means by infrastructure is not at all what the American people think it means.<br />Mr. Buttigieg is one of the five cabinet secretaries the president has designated to sell the plan to the American people. In an interview last week with TheGrio.com, he declared “there is racism physically built into some of our highways,” and that this racism was a “conscious choice,” not “just an act of neglect.” If this is truly what Mr. Buttigieg and the administration believe, the trillions they are about to spend will almost certainly end up going less to actual infrastructure needs than some as-yet-to-be defined measure of “equity.”<br />Perhaps Mr. Buttigieg has a case. If so, he and the president should be more forthright in detailing exactly what the administration means when it says the American Jobs Plan “prioritizes addressing long-standing and persistent racial injustice.” Is this limited to targeting “40 percent of the benefits of climate and clean infrastructure investments to disadvantaged communities”? What other agendas might they be piling on here?<br />Because when most Americans hear the word infrastructure, they think of physical structures—roads, bridges, airports, power lines—with clear operational benefits. Infrastructure projects of this sort are popular because people can at least see something tangible for their tax dollars. The administration understands this, which is why, even though roads and bridges are only a fraction of this bill, whenever its salesmen get in trouble pitching it, that’s right where they run.<br />Mr. Buttigieg’s appearance on “Fox News Sunday” is a good example. Host Chris Wallace opened by hammering the secretary for not being “straight” with the American people in claiming the U.S. is ranked 13th globally for infrastructure. (He later also forced Mr. Buttigieg to concede that his estimate that the bill would create 19 million new jobs is not true. The honest estimate is closer to 2.7 million.)</td>

Mr. Boehner isn’t remembered as an effective House leader, but he was among the most plainspoken and least pretentious lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In any case, it’s hard to dislike a man who embraces his reputation as a chain smoker. There must be few quicker ways to make oneself repellent to the nation’s well-heeled political class, and yet he smoked his way all the way to the top legislative office in the land.<br />Unless I’m mistaken, Mr. Boehner wrote this book himself. He could have used a ghostwriter. Every page is heavy with stock phrases, and the author is constantly remarking on things he’ll “never forget as long as I live.” Occasionally the writing is dreadful. Recalling an episode in which Mrs. Pelosi essentially took a committee chairmanship from the legendary powerbroker John Dingell, Mr. Boehner remarks that she “gutted Big John Dingell like a halibut she found floating around San Francisco Bay.” “His entrails were left on display for everyone in the House of Representatives to see,” he goes on. Still, “I don’t think Nancy relished mounting Dingell on her wall.” Later, the reader will be glad to know, the author sees Mrs. Pelosi’s “iron grip on power backfire.”<br />The Washington press corps never cared much for Mr. Boehner, who had the misfortune of leading the Republican House during the tenure of the beloved Barack Obama, but the former speaker has attracted lavish media attention for “On the House: A Washington Memoir.” He has done this by the simple expedient of saying about the GOP what the news media says of it every day: namely, that it has become extreme and perverse and inhabited by “crazies” and “kooks.” That thesis is not without evidence, but Mr. Boehner does little more than state it in several different ways.<br />By “crazies” and “kooks”—or “nuts,” “far-right knuckleheads” and “the freak show set”—he is referring mainly to Republicans who first won office in 2010 and afterward, especially members of the conservative Freedom Caucus. Mr. Boehner took the speakership in 2011 and found himself between a fractious House majority and an administration that barely hid its contempt for Republicans. It was always going to be a difficult job, and it was made impossible by a coterie of House conservatives who badly overestimated their bargaining power. In 2013, for example, Freedom Caucusers and their correlatives in the Senate said they would vote to raise the debt limit only at the price of repealing ObamaCare, which was obviously never going to happen. Mr. Boehner rightly calls it “a dumbass idea.”<br />Mr. Boehner’s criticisms of his former antagonists on the right have almost exclusively to do with tactics, not with substance. He fails to acknowledge the distinction, although he insists repeatedly that he agreed with their stated goals. “I was one of the biggest evangelists for fiscal discipline there was,” he claims. How is it, then, that he can brand both the Freedom Caucus and the “Squad” as “political terrorists”? What distinguishes the members of the Squad, foremost among them Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, isn’t their willingness to pursue traditional Democratic goals by immoderate methods but their embrace of radical progressivism. The media buzz surrounding Mr. Boehner’s book has happily ignored this distinction and presented “On the House” as more evidence that the GOP has moved dramatically to the right. In fact, the party hasn’t moved much at all on policy, but it has become far more aggressive on tactical questions. Nor does Mr. Boehner exhibit the slightest curiosity about why, as he puts it, “the crazies came to town.” They just did, in his telling.</td>

      <td>It’s imprudent to weigh in on issues that don’t directly affect the company.</td>
      <td>A few CEOs have expressed their point of view about the new Georgia voting law. They have issued statements indicating their opposition on the basis that the law will suppress voting. Other senior executives, retired and active, have joined them. I know most of them by reputation and some personally. They are people of goodwill, who sincerely care about the nation, their companies and their employees and customers. Most have done excellent work as leaders of their companies. All have my respect and I believe have earned the respect of the public. But I believe they are wrong to take public positions on this law.<br />I believe both that voting ought to be relatively simple for citizens and that verification of eligibility to vote should be strict as a matter of principle. It is clear that any verification of ballot integrity will increase difficulty. In my view, the Georgia law reaches a reasonable trade-off between those two objectives.<br />But the reason I think CEOs should be silent on this issue isn’t because I disagree with their judgment on the merits. It’s because I think it is wrong for executives to take a company position on public-policy questions that don’t directly affect their business, for four reasons.<br />First, while these CEOs have the right to their own opinions, they can never speak merely as individuals; they always speak for and represent the companies they head. As CEOs they have the right, and perhaps the obligation, to speak out on matters affecting their organizations, but unless they have asked their boards for approval before speaking, they don’t have that right on unrelated matters.<br />Second, inevitably their announcements on purely political issues will alienate many of their employees and customers. Those positions will always lead to unintended consequences. In the Georgia situation, it immediately prompted Major League Baseball to move the All-Star Game to Denver, which then brought on charges of hypocrisy because of baseball’s close ties to two dictatorships—Cuba and China. It also generated calls to boycott two major Atlanta-based companies. This won’t be the end of the backlash.</td>
