      <td>Nico Muhly’s two-person opera inspired by the true story of Joyce Mitchell, a prison tailor who helped two inmates escape; a SOLO performance by John Holiday of an 1887 temperance poem set to music by Tyshawn Sorey.</td>
      <td><br />The pandemic shutdown has pushed opera companies to commission new works designed to be viewed on computer screens. Catapult Opera, founded by the conductor Neal Goren (formerly head of the now-defunct Gotham Chamber Opera), had planned to present its first-ever season live in 2020-21. Foiled by Covid-19, the company instead launched a digital commissioning program. The first result is “The Glitch,” a 22-minute, two-character opera by composer Nico Muhly and librettist Greg Pierce. As filmed by director Marcus Shields, performed by baritone Lester Lynch and soprano Krysty Swann, and conducted by Mr. Goren, the piece powerfully demonstrates how the small screen can make opera—often the grandest of art forms—truly intimate.<br />The characters are based on real people: Joyce “Tilly” Mitchell and her husband, Lyle. In 2015, Tilly, a civilian employee who worked in the tailor shop of a prison, helped two inmates escape by providing prison contraband. She had agreed to accompany them once the men broke out, and part of the scheme involved killing her husband. But at the last minute, she did not join the convicts on the run and Lyle was not murdered. The opera imagines Tilly’s conversation with her husband after she has confessed and gone to prison herself. (Readers might remember the story from the television series “Escape at Dannemora,” which dramatized the tale.)<br />Mr. Pierce’s trenchant libretto drills deep into the couple’s questions for each other and themselves, their motives and their bond. “How could you? Who are you?” Lyle asks. Tilly’s response, a romantic fantasy about the prisoner Richie and a dream of escape from everyday life, turns darker with her realization that Richie, a convicted murderer, might well have abandoned or killed her while they were on the lam. Lyle answers her erotic taunting with an invented dalliance of his own that Tilly knows almost instantly is a lie. And even though Tilly suggests that killing Lyle (whom the conspirators called the “glitch” in the plan) was her idea, not Richie’s, and that she wants to be rid of him even now, he insists that he will stand by her.<br />“The Glitch” delves so skillfully into the immediate emotional reality of these two people that you don’t even need to know the background. Mr. Muhly’s lyrical vocal settings and atmospheric piano accompaniment performed by Adam Tendler feel like natural expressions of emotion, be they rapturous imaginings or angry confusion. The singers are filmed with darkness around them, as if they are alone in the void with their feelings and each other; Mr. Shields astutely often shows the reacting partner instead of the singing one, so we hear the words and see their effect. The intensity of the voices—Mr. Lynch’s opulent baritone and Ms. Swann’s wiry mezzo—and both singers’ remarkable ability to act with their faces are such that their performances never seem oversized or artificial on the small screen. Instead, we are drawn into their worlds. The real power of opera is less in its grandeur than in its ability to express the otherwise inexpressible; “The Glitch” does that with extraordinary grace.</td>

      <td>The 25-year-old singer-songwriter confronts her struggle with substance abuse on an album that embraces melody.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />The first sound we hear on “Hardline”—the opening track from “Little Oblivions” (Matador), the new album by 25-year-old Julien Baker—is a heavy chord from an organ that brings to mind the sanctity of church but also, with its woolly distortion, distress. In the context of Ms. Baker’s oeuvre, this sound alone marks a major shift.<br />Her first album, 2015’s “Sprained Ankle,” a collection of shadowy folk numbers, almost exclusively featured her voice, acoustic guitar, and a bit of piano. On 2017’s acclaimed follow-up, “Turn Out the Lights,” she plugged her instrument into an amp and added touches of strings and woodwinds, but the record was drum-free and still spare in the extreme. Yet that organ chord on “Hardline” and the percussion that enters shortly after suggest that we’re in for a different kind of experience on album number three, one where instrumental color and sharper melodies share the load with Ms. Baker’s dark lyrics and expressive singing.</td>

      <td>New gun-control legislation could allow cities to ban handguns</td>
      <td>Canada is introducing new gun-control legislation that would make it possible for individual cities to ban handguns at a local level and says it will create a buyback program for military-style semiautomatic weapons that were banned from use by the country’s Liberal government last year.<br />The planned legislation will also create new offenses for altering a magazine to allow more shots to be fired without reloading, and develop a system that would allow concerned friends or family members to apply to a court and request the immediate, temporary removal of an individual’s firearms.<br />The planned measures come nearly a year after Canada prohibited the use of more than 1,500 models of military-style semiautomatic weapons, including the AR-15. AR-15 style rifles have been used in some of the deadliest U.S. mass shootings, including attacks at a concert in Las Vegas in 2017 and a high school in Parkland, Fla., in 2018.<br />The Canadian government said it plans to introduce a buyback program for the banned firearms in the coming months, and will make it illegal to transfer, sell or bequeath the weapons outside of that program.<br />The government said its buyback program will be voluntary. That means someone who decides not to turn in a banned military-style semiautomatic weapon can still store it as a collectors’ item but must abide by rules governing its storage and can never transfer or legally use the firearm.</td>

      <td>In a Netflix series based on the Sarah Pinborough novel, coincidences lead a single mom to become entangled with a psychiatrist and his troubled wife.</td>
      <td>There’s no such thing as coincidence, people say, but those people have not seen “Behind Her Eyes,” which presents several whoppers of happenstance before it’s even warmed up. As readers of the Sarah Pinborough novel know—and unsuspecting customers will find out—mere terrestrial phenomena of time and place can’t hold a votive candle to the otherworldly avenues the storyline will follow, into what will no doubt be dead ends of epic eye-rolling and consumer consternation.<br />All of which is odd, because the six-part series, created by Steve Lightfoot, does what it does very well, as long as it remains rooted in the human. Louise (Simona Brown) and David (Tom Bateman) literally run into each other inside a London pub, requiring Louise to compensate for the drink spilled on David. He will thereafter smooch Louise when they’re saying good night on the sidewalk. She’s not entirely unreceptive, but he’s apologetic and flees into the night. And wouldn’t you know it? The next day, David turns out to be the new psychiatrist at the medical practice where Louise works as a secretary.<br />“What’re the odds?” Louise will say, to which a viewer might respond “You tell me.”<br />The divorced Louise has a son, Adam (Tyler Howitt), who is adorable; the married David has a wife, Adele (Eve Hewson), who is disturbed. How and why are the mysteries that propel the first couple of episodes. She seems to be a doting spouse. “They’re lucky to have you,” Adele says, as her husband leaves for his first day on the new job. “Like me.” He cringes. When she assures him that “I’ll be here” when he gets home that night, it sounds like a threat. Generally speaking, sex scenes are, all titillation aside, fairly useless. They tell you nothing about characters or motivations. But thanks to Norwegian filmmaker Erik Richter Strand, who directed this entire U.K.-based series, the one between Adele and David says almost everything about their relationship that needs to be said. It’s eloquent, as is one that comes later in the show, and contains all the joy the first one lacks.<br />There are tantalizing bread crumbs of psychological innuendo strewn all over the path from Scotland, where we meet a much younger Adele, to London, where she and David have only recently moved. They’ve had to relocate frequently over the intervening 10 years, it seems, and the reasons will become more and more evident after Louise, walking down the street, literally knocks Adele over. They’ve not previously met, but soon discover they have David in common. The chance encounters just keep coming.</td>

      <td>Jennifer Harrington’s smart horror film skewers social-media influencers—literally.</td>
      <td>That the horror platform Shudder is presenting “Shook” is appropriate enough: The streaming service is a virtual catalog of frightful content, and Jennifer Harrington’s feature is a connoisseur’s movie. An update on the slasher film, it takes the plot devices common to the classics of the form—the ultraviolence, the simple morality, the deserving victims, the emotionally tortured villains—and tweaks them into today. Most significantly, and humorously, Ms. Harrington uses social media the way “Halloween,” “Scream” and “When a Stranger Calls” used the land-line telephone—as a weaponized instrument of torment.<br />That director Harrington makes social-media influencers the victims of her mayhem—but not before making them ridiculous—is a guilty pleasure, and meant to be. When we first see Mia (Daisye Tutor) and her fellow stars of online marketing, they are being photographed at what appears to be a red-carpet event. Lights are flashing. Mics are waving. Enthusiastic crowd noise is percolating. Then the camera pulls back and we see the truth—the young women and their camera crew are inside an otherwise abandoned warehouse, with prerecorded sound pumped in and no one around but them. Which is spooky: On the loose in their Southern California community is a serial murderer of small dogs. Yes, dogs. But before the evening is over, said killer will have graduated to people, with one of the influencers impaled on her own stiletto heel.<br />It has to be said that several of Ms. Harrington’s forays into physical violence (she co-wrote the story with Alesia Glidewell) will make one wince, flinch and/or recoil. But such cringe-inducing content is hardly foreign territory within the genre being deconstructed. Nor are ambivalent characters. Mia, for instance, is a classically conflicted heroine/victim: Her late mother, who died of the hereditary “Livingston’s disease,” was cared for solely by Mia’s sister, Nicole (a terrific and funny Emily Goss), who asked Mia for help and was rebuffed. Needing to travel for her own medical care, Nicole asks Mia to babysit her dog, and for the first time Mia agrees to do it—but only because it’s good for her brand, given the ongoing dog murders. (No dogs are actually harmed in the making of this movie, but there are crime-scene photos…) Once she’s alone at Nicole’s, with the dog, Mia is besieged by threatening calls, from someone who at times seems to be inside the house.<br />One of Ms. Harrington’s ingenious moves is the demonization of the smart home, and the possible repercussions of living one’s life online. “How do you know Jade?” Mia asks her mystery caller, when he refers to one of her friends. How would he not know Jade? Everything about Mia’s life is available on the web, or courtesy of Alexa (renamed Diana here, after Nicole and Mia’s mother). Nicole’s house is set up with surveillance cameras (because of her invalid mom); Mia’s life is one long live feed. Her every thought becomes a text. The horror isn’t just about what’s going to happen to her, but the life she leads. At least for the time being.<br />“Shook” has the requisite twists to make it much more than a straightforward horror-shocker, and the sharp turns are sufficient to have viewers profoundly dizzy about where it’s all going to go. They may also wonder, as I did, why imperiled dogs are more nervous-making than imperiled people. But that’s part of Ms. Harrington’s commentary on a genre in which people are disposable and pets make you worry.</td>

      <td>The NAACP, on behalf of Rep. Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against former President Donald Trump and his former personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, accusing them of conspiring to incite the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />The lawsuit also names two right-wing groups, Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, as defendants. Some members of each group have been arrested in connection with the attack, which left five people, including one police officer, dead.<br />The lawsuit, filed in Washington alleges that Messrs. Trump and Giuliani and members of the two groups conspired to prevent Congress from fulfilling its official duties to certify election results—which they allege violates the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act. That law, which targeted unrest after the Civil War, allows suits seeking compensation for civil-rights violations.<br />Lawmakers were in the process of certifying President Biden’s electoral victories on Jan. 6 when the rioters swarmed the Capitol, halting the process for hours. Lawmakers and aides were rushed out of the House and Senate chambers, huddling in office buildings and, in some cases, hiding for hours until law enforcement was able to end the riot. Videos played during the impeachment trial showed the mob coming close to finding aides hiding in the Capitol.<br />“January 6th was one of the most shameful days in our country’s history, and it was instigated by the President himself. His gleeful support of violent white supremacists led to a breach of the Capitol that put my life, and that of my colleagues, in grave danger,” Mr. Thompson said in a statement.</td>

He said they would take effect on Feb. 23.<br />A confidential report by the International Atomic Energy Agency on Tuesday, seen by The Wall Street Journal, detailed measures that would severely limit the ability of the agency to oversee Iran’s nuclear work.<br />The monitoring of Iran’s nuclear facilities was the last major component of the 2015 nuclear deal that Tehran had abided by. Iran started to breach key aspects of that agreement in July 2019 in retaliation for the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement and imposition of sanctions on Tehran.</td>

A civilian U.S. contractor who was a Filipino national was killed and nine others were injured.<br />At least three other people were injured outside of the base, according to Iraqi officials. Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s self-governing Kurdish region, has long been an enclave of calm in a region still recovering from years of war.<br />The air base is located within a high-security complex that also includes Erbil’s civilian international airport. The airport is protected by multiple layers of security and managed to keep operating even when Islamic State forces came within mere miles of the city in 2014.<br />President Biden was briefed on the attack, a White House spokesman said Monday night, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Kurdistan Regional Government Prime Minister Masrour Barzani and Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi to discuss the attack, according to officials from both countries.</td>

That rate could potentially be slower than the 47% gain it recorded for 2020 compared with 2019.<br />The company isn’t “focused on the day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, near-term focus that, quite frankly, destroys businesses,” said Chief Executive Officer Alexander Karp. “It’s one of the main reasons why so many of our businesses, especially in tech, are actually only serving Wall Street and not serving their clients,” he added.<br />Palantir plans to expand its sales team by triple-digit levels this year, operations chief Shyam Sankar told investors Tuesday.</td>

      <td>Exposure and frozen pipes threaten cattle; dairy farmers are forced to dump milk after plant shutdowns</td>
      <td>Bitter cold and power outages have created a crisis for some Texan farms and ranches, leaving livestock dead from exposure and raising fears that herds could run short of food and water.<br />Forced shutdowns of plants that process milk and make animal feed are disrupting the state’s agricultural supply chains, industry executives said. Some farmers are being forced to dump tankers of milk on fields because it can’t be processed, and state agriculture officials feared livestock may have to be euthanized if they cannot be watered and fed.<br />“No feed, no water, and no heat doesn’t make for a good situation,” said Sid Miller, Texas agriculture commissioner. Mr. Miller on Tuesday said he was urging state utilities to restore electricity to rural areas—some of which he said had gone without power for more than 30 hours straight—while fielding calls from cattlemen losing calves to the cold and poultry farmers struggling with frozen water pipes.<br />A rare winter storm over the weekend and record-low temperatures in some parts of Texas caused power demand in the state to outpace supply, as thermostats were cranked up. At the same time, freezing temperatures forced some natural-gas and coal-fired power plants offline, while wind turbines in West Texas froze and snow blanketed banks of solar panels. Texas power officials called for rotating outages to manage the shortfall, but in some parts of the state those measures have led to extended stretches without power.<br />The situation has turned into chaos for some producers in one of the country’s most livestock- and poultry-heavy states. Texas in December counted about 2.9 million cattle on feedlots, the most in the nation, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The state’s dairies house the country’s fifth-largest dairy herd with about 613,000 milking cows, and Texas is the sixth-biggest chicken producer, raising about 675 million birds for slaughter in 2019, according to the latest USDA figures.</td>

Letting out a loud yelp, the woman flung a handful of birdseed in the air.<br />Suddenly, a flurry of titmice, cardinals, blue jays and robins appeared, as Ms. Flores stood there amazed. The stranger offered her some seeds, and Ms. Flores poured some on her gloved hand, holding it out in front of her. One by one, the birds began to land on her fingers.<br />“I was elated. I felt blessed,” says Ms. Flores, 67, a writer. “She saw me beaming, and I could tell she smiled. Then she went on her way.” Now, Ms. Flores says she is motivated to go outside almost every day.<br />Strangers can soothe and support us when no one else is around, or boost our mood with a smile or a laugh. They can distract us from the chatter in our own head and help expand our perspective. They can make us feel connected and remind us we are not alone.<br />Yet we’re missing out on many of these serendipitous moments during the pandemic. Social distancing, working from home and the disruption of normal activities have reduced our opportunities for casual exchanges with people we don’t know, or with whom we have only loose ties. Yet, if we work at it, it’s possible to generate those moments even now—and psychologists say we should.</td>

      <td>Regarding your editorial “The Great Student Loan Scam” (Feb. 10): I would readily support loan forgiveness if the beneficiary were required to do community service for the forgiven debt. I would suggest a rate of $15 an hour, the Biden administration proposed federal minimum wage. So for someone being forgiven $15,000 in debt, he or she would owe 1,000 hours of community service.<br />Jeff Kindl<br />Mandeville, La.<br /><br />You conclude that Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is putting off a vote on student-debt forgiveness because it is only popular with “progressive elites.” Based on our polling, we know support is much broader than that. With backing from two-thirds of people under 56 years old, a majority of American adults say the government should actually annul all student debt. Even boomers, who by a slight majority oppose voiding any student loans, overwhelmingly want the government to insert itself into the marketplace and impose price controls on the cost of higher education.</td>

      <td>Regarding Sadanand Dhume’s “Rihanna Rallies to the Wrong Cause in India” (East Is East, Feb. 5): Greta Thunberg and Meena Harris would condemn India to feudal agrarianism if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi were to heed their calls and rescind his historic agriculture deregulation. Half of India’s workers toil as serfs in low productivity, undignified subsistence farming with the sector accounting for a paltry 15% of the economy. Compared with the average American farm plot of 440 acres, 86% of Indian agriculture holdings are less than five acres and are too marginal to ever achieve economies of scale. Indian crop yields consequently are half of those of the U.S. Due to rapacious government-backed wholesale cartels, the markup between prices remunerated to farmers and what consumers pay is 65% in India compared with 10% in other nations. Forty percent of India’s fruits and vegetables rot before reaching the marketplace because of anachronistic antihoarding laws that deter investment in refrigeration.<br />Mr. Modi’s audacious market reforms are vital for weaving together his country’s 4,000 fragmented agriculture markets into a national whole. McKinsey & Co. estimates that a robust decontrol of farming could raise cultivation output by $175 billion, doubling farmers’ incomes over eight years. Untangling farmers and supply chains from a morass of red tape, grain-storage limits and monopolistic middlemen—coupled with more private investment—is an eminently sensible policy regime, unlike the usual nostrums of bailouts and farm-loan waivers peddled by past Indian governments. Prime Minister Modi deserves accolades for launching the opening salvo against the agriculture license raj.<br />Nathan Punwani<br />Los Angeles</td>

He ponders whether this “trend” is real—but Mr. Riley needn’t look far for clarity.<br />That very same Times piece includes a poll from EdNext that found parents’ opinions of teachers’ unions have become more favorable during the pandemic. It also cites a poll from EdChoice that found that two-thirds of parents felt teachers unions had a “helpful” impact on student learning. Mr. Riley could have also noted a poll released last week from HuffPost/YouGov that showed far more parents of children in K-12 schools approve of how unions are handling the pandemic than disapprove.<br />The truth is no one knows better than teachers the limitations and deficiencies of remote learning. And no one has worked harder than teachers to secure the resources to safely reopen buildings. While charter schools remain closed, traditional public schools—in New York, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco—are reopening with protocols in place to mitigate virus transmission. This isn’t a binary choice: both in-school learning and safety are important. But rather than solve problems, Mr. Riley would prefer to embark on a fresh round of teacher bashing that has fallen out of favor with politicians and the public at large.<br />Randi Weingarten<br />President</td>

      <td>For decades, Iran has built and operated a network of loyal armed groups around the Middle East that seek to expand Tehran’s military footprint and gain political influence in the region.<br />These groups often operate under the direction of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Founded after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the Revolutionary Guard seeks to defend the Iranian state and advance the model of Shiite Islam that underpinned the revolution.<br />This network of militias was long overseen by Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian commander of the Guards’ foreign wing, the Quds Force, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in January 2020. In recent years, Washington has accused several Iran-backed militias of killing American service members and has designated some as terrorist organizations.<br />In the wake of Gen. Soleimani’s death, new groups have emerged in Iraq, claiming responsibility for attacks targeting American interests. Not much is known about these groups, but many are believed to be splinters of bigger, long-established factions using new names in an attempt to shield their identity.<br />On Monday, a little-known Shiite militia group named the Guardians of the Blood Brigade claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on the U.S.-led coalition in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan, that killed a contractor and injured several others, including a U.S. service member.

      <td>The proposed legislation heads to the French Senate amid criticism that it stigmatizes Muslims</td>
      <td>PARIS—France’s National Assembly approved a bill Tuesday that aims to strengthen government oversight of mosques and religious schools and crack down on other practices—from online hate speech to forced marriage—that President Emmanuel Macron says are rooted in Islamist separatism.<br />The proposed legislation passed the National Assembly, or lower house of Parliament, with a vote of 347-151, garnering support from lawmakers in Mr. Macron’s ranks as well as other centrist parties. It now heads to the Senate.<br />Mr. Macron and his supporters in Parliament have framed the bill as a response to the spread of “Islamist separatism,” which the president describes as an ideology that aims to build a parallel society in France where religious rules override civil laws. That ideology, the Macron government says, undermines the values of the French Republic—liberty, equality and fraternity—as well as laïcité, France’s strict separation of religion and state.<br />The proposed legislation requires religious associations and mosques to declare foreign funding of more than €10,000 ($12,000), and to sign a pledge to respect France’s republican values to receive state subsidies. The bill would also make it easier for the government to shut down mosques, associations and schools that are found criticizing republican values.<br />The proposed legislation would make it a criminal offense for anyone, in the name of ideology or religious extremism, to put pressure on civil servants and public-service providers to deviate from France’s secular values. Under its provisions, a man who refuses to allow a male doctor to examine his wife could face up to five years in jail and a fine of up to €75,000.</td>

      <td>Renewable energy and market design are easy targets during electricity failures but they are inadequate explanations</td>
      <td>Rolling blackouts in Texas during a historic winter storm are inviting scrutiny of everything from the grid’s reliance on wind energy to laissez-faire market design. The answer is actually quite simple: Texas isn’t used to the cold.<br />Just as observers blamed high solar penetration for California’s electricity blackouts last year, Texas’s bounty of wind power has been an easy target. Yet Texas counts on wind to meet only 10% of its winter capacity, according to the state’s  grid manager. Natural gas and coal make up the lion’s share, comprising 82%. Sure, some wind turbines glitched under cold weather conditions, but so did natural gas- and coal-fired power. That is partly because water intake facilities froze for these generators, just as they did in the last extreme winter seen in February 2011. At least some natural gas had to be redirected for heating rather than power, adding to the supply shortage.<br />Another point of criticism is market design. While other regional markets are designed to reward power plants for being on standby in case of unexpected demand peaks, Texas’s approach is fairly market-driven. That has meant the state historically has had a smaller cushion of electricity when demand has peaked, but this is no longer a problem.<br />Reserve margins—excess electricity generation capacity over demand—were dangerously low in 2018 and 2019 but bounced to 10.6% in 2020 and are expected to hit 15.5% in 2021. They clearly aren’t to blame in this winter storm’s failure: Winter peak demand hit a record 69,150 megawatts over the weekend, but up to 34,000 megawatts of supply were taken offline. Texas had no problem meeting a higher summer peak demand, which was 7% higher last year than this winter event.<br />Solutions will have to be nuanced and incremental. Winterizing all power plants would be unnecessarily expensive, and so would a complete overhaul of Texas’s market design, which is partly responsible for consistently low power prices compared with the rest of the country.</td>

      <td>Democrats want to impose federal rules on elections for president. Congress doesn’t have that power.</td>
      <td>House Democrats have made election “reform” their top legislative priority. House Resolution 1, styled the For the People Act, would vitiate existing state election laws, federalize the rules of congressional and presidential elections, and effectively do the same for state elections, which are often conducted on the same ballot. Critics have noted that the proposed rules are designed to benefit Democrats. They’re also unconstitutional.<br />The key problem is that the Constitution doesn’t give Congress the authority to regulate all federal elections in the same way. Congress has significant power over congressional elections. The Elections Clause of Article I, Section 4 provides that state legislatures “shall prescribe” the “times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,” but also authorizes Congress to “make or alter such regulations.”<br />Yet Congress has only limited authority over the conduct of presidential elections. They are governed by the Electors Clause in Article II, Section 1, which provides: “Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the United States.” Congress’s timing determination is binding on the states, as the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held last year in Carson v. Simon, which rejected Minnesota’s modification of its ballot-receipt deadline. (The Honest Elections Project sponsored the litigation, and Mr. Rivkin was the plaintiffs’ lead attorney.)<br />But the Electors Clause gives state legislatures plenary power over the manner of selecting presidential electors. It does not permit lawmakers to promulgate a comprehensive federal elections code. Nor does the 15th Amendment, which bars racial discrimination in voting, or the other amendments extending the franchise. Each grants Congress the power to enforce its guarantees through “appropriate legislation.” But as the Supreme Court explained in City of Boerne v. Flores (1997), “Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is.” None of these amendments guarantee the right to vote in any particular way—such as by mail versus in person—so Congress can’t rightly be said to be enforcing them through H.R.1. And none of them repeal the Electors Clause.<br />Although all 50 state legislatures have provided for popular election of presidential electors, the legislatures could change state law and appoint electors directly. H.R.1 violates the Electors Clause on its face, purporting to govern not merely the time, place and manner of congressional elections, but also regulating presidential elections in exactly the same prescriptive matter as congressional elections.</td>

      <td>The world is watching how he responds to an attack on U.S. forces.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden has said his Presidency won’t be a third Obama term, and he’ll have plenty of opportunities to prove it. The latest comes after a rocket attack against the U.S.-led coalition in Erbil, Iraq.<br />“Initial reports indicate that the attacks killed one civilian contractor and injured several members of the Coalition, including one American service member and several American contractors,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday. He added that he had told the leader of Kurdistan’s regional government that Washington would help “to investigate and hold accountable those responsible.” America’s adversaries will be watching, especially in Tehran.<br />An investigation is under way, but it’s hard to believe a Shiite militia allied with Iran isn’t behind the attack. The group Awliya Al Dam, or Guardians of Blood, has claimed responsibility. U.S. and Iraqi officials say smaller organizations like this have been linked to better known Iranian proxies such as Kataib Hezbollah. SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks extremist groups’ online activity, reports that Awliya Al Dam has vowed more violence after the latest incident.<br />Iranian proxies launched several rocket attacks on U.S. and allied forces in 2019 and 2020. Their goal is to drive out the roughly 2,500 U.S. troops that assist the Iraqi military, provide intelligence against a return of Islamic State, and limit malign Iranian influence in the country. Retaliatory strikes won’t put a complete stop to such aggression, but the right retaliation can degrade the militias’ abilities. Inaction could invite more brazen attacks.<br />Before Donald Trump ordered the retaliatory attack on Iranian terror chief Qasem Soleimani in January 2020, many warned such a response would lead to a full-scale war. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei tweeted that Mr. Trump “can’t do anything.” Mr. Biden doesn’t need to escalate to Mr. Trump’s level, but it’s worth reminding Tehran that he isn’t Barack Obama—and the U.S. can do something.</td>

The speech has been seen as the opening salvo in Mr. McConnell’s effort to marginalize Mr. Trump’s influence in the Republican Party. It will be an uphill battle.<br />A Quinnipiac survey released on Monday found that only 11% of Republicans held Mr. Trump responsible for inciting the violence on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6. A mere 9% supported conviction. Only 16% would support even the symbolic rebuke of a censure motion. Not only do 87% of Republicans believe Mr. Trump should be allowed to hold office again; 75% want him to play a “prominent role” in the Republican Party.<br />What does such a role entail? A recent Gallup survey found that 68% of Republicans want the former president to remain their party’s leader. According to an Axios-Ipsos poll, 66% of Republicans believe that their party is better with Mr. Trump in it, and 57% favor him as their party’s 2024 presidential candidate. These sentiments may change over time. But for now, efforts to weaken Mr. Trump’s influence within the party will not succeed.<br />If anything, the opposite seems more likely. State and county Republican Party organizations across the country are censuring elected officials who broke with Mr. Trump to support his impeachment in the House and conviction in the Senate. The Trump base has anathematized even Trump loyalists such as former Vice President Mike Pence, who honored their oath of office. These supporters will not countenance anything short of unswerving fealty to Mr. Trump.<br />No doubt there are differences within the Republican Party between Trump supporters and party regulars. According to NBC, 87% of Trump supporters have “very positive” views of the former president, a sentiment shared by only 44% of party regulars.</td>

      <td>Marriott International Inc.  Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson, who created the world’s largest hotel operator by acquiring Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. in 2016, died Monday. He was 62.<br />A Lutheran missionary’s son who was born in Japan and grew up in Minnesota, he became CEO of Marriott in 2012 and was the first person outside the founding family to head the hotel company. He was diagnosed with stage 2 pancreatic cancer in May 2019 but continued to serve as CEO.<br />The $13 billion acquisition of Starwood created a colossus with 30 brands—including Ritz-Carlton, Courtyard, W Hotels, Westin and Sheraton—and operations in more than 110 countries. Marriott prevailed over rival bidders including  Hyatt Hotels Corp.  and China’s Anbang Insurance Group Co.<br />Marriott coveted Starwood partly to gain more leverage with online travel agents and persuade them to take a smaller cut when customers choose a Marriott brand. Adding more brand choices might also induce more customers to go directly to Marriott’s website, cutting out the middlemen. “We think there are real advantages to size,” Mr. Sorenson told The Wall Street Journal when the purchase was completed.<br />Marriott said Tuesday that Stephanie Linnartz, the group president for consumer operations, technology and emerging businesses, and Tony Capuano, the group president for global development, design and operations services, will share responsibility for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the company.

      <td>Bitcoin topped $50,000 for the first time Tuesday, doubling in value in less than two months.<br />The digital currency traded as high as $50,584.84, up about 5% for the day and more than 74% for the year, according to CoinDesk. The total market value of bitcoin in circulation rose to $940 billion. Bitcoin later receded from its high, recently trading near $48,962.<br />The $50,000 level is an “emotional level for people in the space,” said Brian Melville, head of strategy at trading firm Cumberland. But it is also a simple result of supply and demand, he added.<br />From August through December, about 150,000 new bitcoins were minted, he estimated. The firm calculated that about 359,000 bitcoins were bought in the same period, and that imbalance has continued in 2021. “It’s a really important metric to watch,” he added.<br />That buying demand has brought not only a price rally, but growing acceptance and recognition of an asset that was once an object of derision for regulators and lawmakers.</td>

      <td>Competing acquisition offers for Coherent have pushed laser maker’s valuation to decade high</td>
      <td>Whoever ends up buying  Coherent  may have some explaining to do.<br />In a raging bull market that has left few apparent bargains to be had, the maker of laser components used in OLED displays, semiconductor manufacturing and many other applications likely looked like a steal. Its stock price had slumped 10% last year as sales continued their slide since late 2018. John Marchetti of Stifel downgraded the company following its fiscal year-end results in November, predicting a transition year ahead with limited upside as the company planned to expand its markets.<br />But in less than a month’s time, Coherent has gone from not to hot. The company landed its third acquisition offer in as many weeks on Friday.  II-VI Inc. —pronounced two-six—offered a cash-and-stock deal valuing Coherent at $260 a share. That was just days after  MKS Instruments  offered $240 a share in cash and stock, which itself topped a bid worth about $226 a share from  Lumentum Holdings  that Coherent agreed to on Jan. 19. Even the lowest of those bids values Coherent’s stock at its highest price since early 2018.<br />Coherent said Monday its board has decided to engage in discussions with II-VI, while it also evaluates the offer from MKS. It has yet to change its formal recommendation to shareholders approving the deal with Lumentum. Per the original agreement, Coherent would owe Lumentum a termination fee of $217.6 million if it calls off that deal in favor of another offer.<br />Any further offers would be in thin air. The current round of bids values the shares between 34 and 40 times forward earnings—a multiple Coherent hasn’t commanded since 2009, according to FactSet. That has cast a pall on all of the bidders. Lumentum’s share price fell nearly 17% between the date of the announced deal and the competing offer from MKS on Monday. MKS shares fell 8% when that company announced its own offer, while II-VI shares fell nearly 10% on Friday. Shares of Lumentum and II-VI—the two bidders most likely to succeed—were still down well below their preannouncement levels Monday morning.</td>

      <td>Europe’s economy has relied on government relief programs to provide a third of all lending to businesses during the Covid-19 crisis, revealing the scale of the challenge ahead as the region opens up and support measures are withdrawn.<br />Borrowers in 31 countries across Europe have received €1.5 trillion, equivalent to $1.8 trillion, in relief from governments and banks during the pandemic, the European Systemic Risk Board, a top European financial regulator, said Tuesday.<br />The amount, which includes loan moratoriums, direct grants and tax deferrals, is equivalent to 9% of the collective size of those countries’ economies in 2019.<br />The largess by governments and central banks has created a dilemma in Europe and for economies around the world. Relief measures cushioned the blow to consumers and businesses. But as vaccines are administered and countries start to loosen restrictions, the removal of support could expose weak points in the economy and hamper any bounce back.<br />“Withdrawing fiscal support too soon could exacerbate the effects of the economic crisis and put financial stability at risk,” said Claudia Buch, vice president of the German central bank and chair of the ESRB’s working group. “Maintaining fiscal support for too long would increase budgetary pressures” for governments and potentially foster the creation of zombie companies, she added.</td>

      <td>Boeing ’s  ambitions for a midrange plane may be the right idea at the wrong time—again.<br />Last year, the Chicago-based manufacturer started conversations with customers about building such a jet with a single-aisle cabin. Then, during the fourth-quarter earnings presentation in late January, Chief Executive David Calhoun all but confirmed that the company’s next jet would indeed address the “middle of the market” between long international flights and short-haul domestic ones.<br />This appears to end speculation that Boeing could prioritize a replacement for the troubled 737 MAX, which is now flying again. It is a good call not to undermine MAX sales with talk of a substitute.<br />Last week, the buzz increased after trade journal Aviation Week reported that the new jet could instead be a two-aisle model, reviving the so-called New Midsize Airplane project that Boeing abandoned when Mr. Calhoun took over last year. This time, though, the program wouldn’t just have two variants seating 225 and 275 people, but also a third, smaller one.<br />Boeing has been here before. In 1982, it addressed the middle of the market with its 757 and 767 models. But the 200-seat 757 turned out to be too far ahead of its time: It never gained popularity, only ever finding a place as a repurposed trans-Atlantic jet in the 1990s.</td>

A deal would combine CoreLogic, one of the largest residential real-estate data companies, with CoStar, among the biggest providers of commercial real-estate information and analytics.<br />Stone Point Capital LLC and Insight Partners earlier this month agreed to buy the company for $80 a share, and The Wall Street Journal reported that CoStar was considering options including a new bid. CoStar on Tuesday said it has made multiple acquisition proposals to CoreLogic since October.<br />“We were surprised to see your announcement of the pending transaction when we believed that our last conversation with your advisers had addressed all of your remaining concerns,” CoStar Chief Executive Andrew Florance said in a letter to CoreLogic’s board, referring to the $6 billion deal.<br />CoreLogic shareholders would get 0.1019 share of CoStar for each CoreLogic share they own, according to CoStar’s proposal. CoreLogic said the deal with Stone Point Capital and Insight Partners remains in effect and that it is still urging shareholders to approve the agreement. The company will review CoStar’s proposal with outside legal counsel and financial advisers, it said.</td>

Some establishments along the state’s borders with Minnesota and Illinois, where rules are more stringent, have actually seen a boost in business.<br />In the most recent episode of dueling moves by the governor and legislature, Wisconsin residents experienced whiplash Feb. 4 when within the course of about an hour the state went from having a mask mandate, to not having one, to having one again.<br />“There is an inability to reach an agreement and move things forward,” said Charles Franklin, director of a statewide poll conducted by Marquette Law School. “What we have seen for almost a year now is legislative opposition to some of the governor’s actions, but then the legislature has not advanced its own proposal.”</td>

The shift has brought a wave of new business to Shopify, which sells subscription services that enable people to put up websites, accept online payments, and ship and track orders to customers.<br />But Shopify’s business model carries risks. Analysts expect the surge in e-commerce that drove much of the company’s growth to taper as the pandemic ebbs. “There could be a material deceleration in sales growth,” said Tom Forte, an analyst with DA Davidson.<br />Another risk: Many of the startups that use Shopify’s services are more likely to fail than grow meaningfully, said Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “How can you get capital, and how do you scale up in this kind of environment and this kind of uncertainty?” he said.<br />Most of Shopify’s more than one million customers are first-time entrepreneurs, said Harley Finkelstein, president of the Ottawa-based company, which will report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. “Imagine a future where everyone is an entrepreneur.

She was also accused of a second offense under a natural disaster management law, which has been applied in Myanmar against those who break pandemic-linked restrictions, the lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said.<br />Mr. Zaw wasn’t informed of the second allegation until he was briefed by the judge after the video proceedings, he said. A police spokesman didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />Protesters have been demanding for days that Ms. Suu Kyi, who commands immense popularity and was detained in her house in the capital, Naypyitaw, during the Feb. 1 coup, be set free. The coup ended a decadelong shift toward democracy, putting the military—which ruled for half a century before the transition—back in absolute control. Faced with international pressure and large street demonstrations, the generals have doubled down in recent days.<br />For the last two nights, they ordered near-total internet blackouts. In a show of force, tanks showed up in the streets of Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, on Sunday and Monday. Protesters familiar with military rule live in terror of nightly raids and arrests. Some neighborhoods have assembled teams to keep a watch and alert residents if security forces are sighted.</td>

Then, as now, global stock markets were on a tear, startups were listing at eye-popping prices, and SoftBank was building a huge stable of private companies.<br />“Structurally, we’re at the beginning of the AI [artificial intelligence] revolution, just as we were at the beginning of the internet revolution” in 2000, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said at a press conference in Tokyo last week where the company reported around $11 billion in quarterly profit.<br />The differences are important, too.

      <td>HONG KONG—Nine veteran pro-democracy activists appeared together in court Tuesday on charges related to the mass protests that rocked the city in 2019, in a trial that stands out for the number and prominence of the defendants facing prosecution.<br />They include 82-year-old pro-democracy campaigner Martin Lee, newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai and seven others who face charges of illegal assembly that carry possible sentences of up to five years in prison.<br />While the prosecution of Hong Kong’s opposition has become increasingly commonplace, the defendants in the trial beginning Tuesday are a Who’s Who of an earlier generation of activists who have been fighting for core issues like the rule of law and political participation since before the U.K. returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.<br />Mr. Lee is a U.K.-trained lawyer who co-founded the city’s first pro-democracy party and helped write Hong Kong’s foundational legal document, the 1990 Basic Law. Others charged include Margaret Ng, a 73-year-old barrister; Albert Ho, a 69-year-old lawyer and activist; Lee Cheuk-yan, a 64-year-old labor leader, and Leung Kwok-hung, also 64, a longtime politician and activist known as “Long Hair.”<br />Police arrested the group last April in coordinated early-morning raids that surprised many in the city, since those targeted were generally associated with peaceful activism and running for elected office—not the often bitter clashes between young protesters and the police. For many, the arrests signaled that authorities intended to go beyond prosecuting protesters who committed violence to crush the democracy movement itself.</td>

There is also mounting evidence that some strains might be less susceptible to the vaccines currently authorized in the region, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.<br />The variant first identified in Britain accounted for 96% of viral samples examined at three major laboratories in England by early February, compared with just over a third at the beginning of December, according to the U.K. government.</td>

      <td>U.S. considers whether to waive or impose sanctions on builders of Russian gas pipeline</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is reviewing U.S. policy toward a pipeline designed to carry Russian natural gas to Germany beneath the Baltic Sea, under new pressure after construction on the $11 billion project resumed this month, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.<br />The undersea pipeline, Nord Stream 2, is more than 90% completed, with about 100 miles remaining. Construction resumed in earnest on Feb. 6, more than a year after it came to a halt in the face of opposition from the Trump administration and acts of Congress authorizing sanctions on companies and individuals involved in the project. The Biden administration hasn’t thus far imposed sanctions required by law.<br />The Biden administration has opened talks with Berlin on the future of the pipeline, including “threats of sanctions against companies involved in the construction of Nord Stream 2,” a German official said.<br />The administration on Tuesday faces a deadline to report a list of companies it deems in violation of the U.S. laws aimed at halting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Those companies would be potential targets for U.S. sanctions. The Biden administration could also waive the application of sanctions under a national-interest clause, placating Germany, a critical European ally, handing Russia a geopolitical victory, and crossing a bipartisan coalition in Congress.<br />“The arrival of Russian infrastructure into a NATO country puts all NATO members at risk,” wrote Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.), one of the principal authors of the sanctions legislation, and Jim Risch (R., Idaho), the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to the White House on Friday. “The U.S. relationship with Germany is a cornerstone of the transatlantic alliance. But allowing the completion of Nord Stream II is not a constructive path forward for this partnership.”</td>

      <td>Crude prices have made up their pandemic losses, but further gains are clouded by questions regarding where all the excess barrels went</td>
      <td>Oil is on the move: Both Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices have broken the $60-a-barrel mark, taking the commodity’s price back to where it was before the pandemic. But a mystery still casts a cloud over its recovery.<br />The unsolved question has to do with what is commonly referred to as the case of missing barrels, or the amount of oil that is unaccounted for by the International Energy Agency. It is a mystery that resurfaces every couple of years, particularly when there is a shock in energy markets.<br />In the first half of 2020, for example, the IEA determined that, based on its estimate of oil supply and demand, there was a global inventory increase of 1.39 billion barrels. Out of this, it observed that roughly a quarter had gone into spare storage in countries that are part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, while 8% was in floating storage and in transit. The remaining 68% was unaccounted for.<br />There is always some oil that isn’t tracked, but the number has been growing in more recent oil-market shocks. Last year’s reached a record: The volume of missing barrels in the first half of 2020 was the largest recorded gap between observed and implied inventories since at least 1990, according to an analysis from Bassam Fattouh, Andreas Economou and Michal Meidan of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. In fact, it was almost 10 times as large as the imbalance seen in the second half of 2008 when the global financial crisis hit.<br />One common explanation for the discrepancy is that these barrels simply don’t exist and that it reflects imprecise measurement. Demand is observed with lags, and supply is observed imprecisely, particularly from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, as the Oxford Institute report notes. “The IEA collects data from the governments. So if the government data is off, they’re off,” notes energy economist Philip Verleger. He suggests that the jump in missing barrels could be due to rather mundane reasons: More employees have been laid off or are working from home during the pandemic, which could have led to flawed data collection from primary sources. If true, it is a potentially bullish scenario for oil prices—it means there is much less crude out there than thought.</td>

      <td>Regulation beefs up consumer protection on retirement accounts</td>
      <td>The Labor Department said late last week that it will build upon a Trump administration regulation governing advice that affects the trillions of dollars in retirement accounts, rather than replace it.<br />The measure, which goes into effect Tuesday, will cause many rollovers, in which hundreds of billions of dollars move annually from 401(k)s to individual retirement accounts, to be more heavily regulated. It also gives investors who feel they have been given bad rollover advice the right to file a lawsuit or arbitration claim.<br />Because investment fees tend to be lower in 401(k) plans than in IRAs, “financial firms have a strong incentive to get you to move money out of your 401(k) plan into an IRA, where they can manage it more profitably,” said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America.<br />“This is a signal from the Labor Department that they are going to continue to beef up consumer protections to ensure rollover recommendations are really in consumers’ best interests,” she said.<br />The regulation also will hold advisers to IRA owners to a higher standard when it comes to managing conflicts of interest, including those that arise in the sale of products such as variable annuities that pay commissions or other sales incentives, said Fred Reish, a lawyer who specializes in employee benefits.</td>

That gulf has largely been driven by a rally pushing down U.S. yields and contrasts with an average difference over the last 10 years of 2.15 percentage point.<br />At the same time, about 2.5% of Chinese offshore high-yield debt by face value is likely to default this year, according to forecasts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. credit analysts led by SooChong Lim. The bank’s equivalent U.S. forecast is 3.5%.<br />“China high-yield is extremely cheap versus U.S. high-yield,” said Jean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging-markets fixed income for BNP Paribas Asset Management.</td>

For considerable periods over the past 32 years, an investor saving around 10,000 Japanese yen, the equivalent of about $95, per month would have been better off having kept it all in cash.<br />But right now, that stock investor would be sitting relatively pretty. A 10,000 Japanese yen investment in the MSCI Japan stock index each month since December 1989 would now be worth around 7.7 million yen—against around 4.4 million yen for the same money in a bank account offering a 1% interest rate.</td>

The company also declared a record half-year dividend of $1.01 a share.<br />Prices of iron ore, used to make steel, recently surged to a nine-year high of $176.90 a metric ton. That is well above the cost of roughly $10 to $20 a ton that most global miners incur in digging the commodity out of the ground.<br />For BHP, the higher price for iron ore, as well as for copper, helped to offset lower prices for crude oil and steelmaking coal. During the half-year period, BHP’s average realized price of iron ore jumped 33% year over year, and copper was up 28%.<br />Still, BHP’s statutory net profit fell by 20% to $3.88 billion in the half, from $4.87 billion a year earlier. The result was dragged down by exceptional charges totaling $2.16 billion, led by an impairment of BHP’s energy-coal assets and associated tax losses. Other charges were tied to the pandemic and BHP’s Samarco joint venture with Brazil’s  Vale SA,  which recently restarted operations after a 2015 fatal dam collapse.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, facing the prospect of campaigns from the pro-Trump wing of the Republican party, signaled his willingness to get involved in primary elections to improve the party’s chances of regaining control of the chamber in the next round of elections in 2022.<br />The key to GOP chances of retaking the Senate is “getting candidates who can actually win in November,” Mr. McConnell said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. “That may or may not involve trying to affect the outcome of the primaries.”<br />The carefully chosen phrasing reflects Mr. McConnell’s difficult balancing act as a de facto party leader after the party’s one-time standard-bearer, former President Donald Trump, lost the White House in November elections, and roiled the political world with unfounded assertions that the election was stolen. Extreme elements of Mr. Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, leading to an impeachment trial of the former president.<br />Mr. Trump, who was acquitted, is still enormously popular among many Republican voters. To regain power, Mr. McConnell must tap the considerable energy the Trump movement brings to the party while weeding out any extreme candidates that he worries would have little chance of winning a general election, despite support from Mr. Trump.<br />Some Republicans who are squarely in the Trump wing of the party might easily win even a general election in deeply conservative areas. But such candidates risk complicating the party’s efforts elsewhere in more moderate areas of the country. If Mr. McConnell moves too aggressively against a pro-Trump candidate he deems too close to the fringes of the party, he could invite a backlash from the base.</td>

Gen. Russel Honoré to lead a review of the security infrastructure, interagency processes, and command and control. In a letter to House members on Monday she said, “It is clear from his findings and from the impeachment trial that we must get to the truth of how this happened.”<br />The commission could satisfy Democrats who want to see Mr. Trump and others held to greater account for the Jan. 6 riot after the former president was acquitted Saturday in a Senate impeachment trial. Seven Republicans joined all 50 Democrats in voting to find Mr. Trump guilty of inciting the insurrection. That fell short of the 67 Senate votes needed to convict.<br />Some Democrats, however, have suggested—as did Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell in a blistering speech about Mr. Trump after Saturday’s vote—that the best venue is outside Congress.<br />“I think there’s grounds for further proceedings, both civil and criminal, against former President Trump,” Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos,” noting he supports a 9/11-style commission.</td>

It follows that the list of persons in that sentence—“the president, vice president, and all civil officers”—likewise exhausts its valid subjects.</td>

      <td>Washington was a savvy packager of his own personal virtues. He knew that if you don’t engage in a bit of self-aggrandizement, you lose.</td>
      <td>Playacting is a necessary part of democratic politics, for good and ill. Just as a great actor by definition doesn’t appear to be acting, the successful politician must convince other people of his own virtue and competence without appearing to be concerned with what people think of him. To put the point brutally, you can’t win elections if you’re unable or unwilling to tell people, or somehow to communicate to them, how great you are.<br />I have often thought the great exception to this rule must be George Washington. He did not seek the presidency of the new republic but had to be implored to fill it. I was wrong. The nation’s first president, as David O. Stewart shows in “George Washington: The Political Rise of America’s Founding Father,” carefully cultivated his reputation with the aim of winning preferment at every stage of his adult life. Washington, writes Mr. Stewart at the midpoint of his subject’s public career, “had captured the holy grail for public actors, operating as a politician with extraordinary success while at the same time not seeming to be one at all, with all the negative baggage that the label has always carried.” After 16 years as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses and six as a county magistrate and town trustee, “almost no one thought of him as a political operator, nor would they in the future.”<br />I was prepared to dislike the book. What I suspected was that Mr. Stewart would present Washington as a canny careerist who failed upward—that is, who escaped accountability for his mistakes and rose to the top of Revolution-era political life by means of charm and guile. Again I was wrong. The book is nothing like that. Mr. Stewart has written an outstanding biography that both avoids hagiography and acknowledges the greatness of Washington’s character, all while paying close attention to his rarely voiced but no less fierce political ambitions. He does not flinch from the cruelty of American slavery and Washington’s part in it, but situates him in the time and place of his origins rather than in ours. Mr. Stewart’s writing is clear, often superlative, his judgments are nuanced, and the whole has a narrative drive such a life deserves.<br />Washington was not excessively handsome (although to be fair he was far better looking in his youth and middle age than the famous Gilbert Stuart portrait suggests) but his mien and gait were legendary. Innumerable contemporaries remarked on his graceful walk and gestures, which combined with his physical dimensions (six feet tall, broad shoulders) to make crowded rooms go quiet upon his entry. He refined that advantage by his attire: “In a memorandum for a tailor,” Mr. Stewart notes, “he specified the number of buttonholes in his coat, its length, and the width of the lapels.”<br />“The chief part of my happiness,” Washington wrote in 1755, “[is] the esteem and notice the country has been pleased to honor me with.” He had achieved that esteem and notice by his account—and an accurate account it was—of a battle in which his own side was defeated, partly as a result of Washington’s poor choice of ground, but in which he exhibited spectacular bravery and endurance. He met with little success in other battles of the French and Indian War, not always through his own fault, but he maintained an ability to inspire the troops under his command with trust and courage.</td>

      <td>This has been one of the shortest and coldest diplomatic honeymoons on record.</td>
      <td>It hasn’t been the most promising start. Less than a month into Joe Biden’s presidency, and his administration is already engaged in spats with China, Russia and Iran. It is also discovering that U.S. allies are not quite as happy with Mr. Biden’s Feb. 4 announcement that “America is back” as many Democrats might have hoped.<br />In Asia the administration’s Myanmar policy—imposing sanctions that signal displeasure without materially affecting the army’s ability to rule—has attracted little enthusiasm. On Feb 15, India’s foreign minister hailed Indo-Japanese cooperation on regional infrastructure projects that link Myanmar with its neighbors, a not-so-subtle signal that India intends to go on cooperating with Myanmar no matter what Washington wants. Simultaneously, the large portion of the Indian press that supports the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is aflame with resentment that Vice President Kamala Harris’s niece, Meena Harris, seems to be siding with protesters against BJP policies.<br />European leaders are also dismissive of American moralism. French President Emmanuel Macron denounced the importation of U.S.-academic and cultural wokeness as a threat to the French way of life, while pragmatists on the Continent are pushing to strengthen economic relations with Russia and China—virtually ignoring the Biden administration’s efforts to raise the pressure on human-rights abusers in Moscow and Beijing. With the U.S. trade representative’s recent announcement that Trump-era retaliatory tariffs on European wine, cheese and food imports aren’t going away soon, this has been one of the shortest and coldest diplomatic honeymoons on record.<br />In the Middle East, Iran is showing no eagerness to ease the administration’s path back into the 2015 nuclear deal. And both Israel and the conservative Arab states resent the American shift in that direction. As for restless NATO ally Turkey, Mr. Biden promised during the campaign to help President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s opposition. The new administration has so far criticized a crackdown on pro-LGBTQ student demonstrators and called on Ankara to release the dissident Osman Kavala.<br />Closer to home, the unceremonious cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline miffed Canadians. The Biden administration appears headed for a fight with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over deforestation in the Amazon basin—a sensitive issue for the Brazilian right. Mexico’s left-populist President Andrés Manuel López Obrador delayed congratulating Mr. Biden on his election, passed a law limiting U.S.-Mexican collaboration over drug trafficking, and offered political asylum to Julian Assange.</td>

      <td>Workers have more to fear from well-meaning pols than from capitalism.</td>
      <td>As these things always do, it started out with the best intentions. In January the City Council of Long Beach, Calif., adopted an ordinance requiring large grocery-store chains to pay employees an extra $4 an hour. The idea was to reward them for the risks they took by doing their jobs amid the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />It didn’t turn out that way. In response to the ordinance,  Kroger Co.  announced it would close two Long Beach supermarkets. Once again, workers were sacrificed to greed. As local union leader John Grant told the Washington Post, “it’s reckless capitalism run amok.”<br />But is it?<br />As one of the world’s largest retailers, Kroger makes an easy villain. But instead of blaming “reckless capitalism,” might the fault lie with the reckless politicians who passed this measure? Thanks to their intervention, instead of finding an extra $4 an hour in their paychecks, nearly 200 grocery workers will now have no paychecks at all unless they are transferred to another store or find another job. It’s but the latest illustration of economist Thomas Sowell’s dictum that whatever a government might set it at, “the real minimum wage is always zero.”<br />What happened to these workers is worth bearing in mind as Congress debates whether to raise the federal minimum wage. For though the Long Beach ordinance was called “hero pay” and meant to be temporary, it operated as a minimum-wage increase for the affected grocery workers. And just as the Long Beach City Council passed it unanimously and without much thought that it could end up doing more harm to these workers than good, those now pressing Congress to include the $15-an-hour federal minimum wage in its Covid-19 relief package ask us to believe the costs would be nonexistent or minimal.</td>

      <td>‘By far the most difficult challenge was reporting that Trump had gotten something right.’</td>
      <td>Alexander Nazaryan of Yahoo News writing for the Atlantic, Feb. 11:<br /><br />Covering the [Trump] administration was thrilling for many journalists, in the way that I imagine storming Omaha Beach must have been for a 20-year-old fresh from the plains of Kansas. He hadn’t signed up for battle, but there he was, liberating France. France, by the way, is where Trump called American soldiers who’d fallen in combat “suckers” and “losers.” When this magazine first reported those comments, Trump’s supporters denounced the Atlantic story as preposterous and offensive, even as outlet after outlet confirmed the reporting. They failed to realize that the preposterous and the offensive were the twin beacons of the Trump presidency. Journalists were merely going where he led. This was our Omaha Beach. . . .<br />By far the most difficult challenge was reporting that Trump had gotten something right. This had a surreal, faintly futile quality, like trying to narrate a traffic jam play by play. I am thinking, in particular, of Trump’s push to reopen schools throughout the spring and summer. The push was poorly thought-out, rushed, and ineffective. It was also worth fighting for, only woe to the journalist who argued as much, as the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof would discover. To simply point out that Trump had improbably managed to alight on the correct course of action was to have written a favorable profile of Osama bin Laden.</td>

      <td>U.S. crash investigators are examining half a dozen accidents in which private turboprop planes built by Piper Aircraft Inc. experienced difficulties with steering on runways after touchdowns.<br />The probe by the National Transportation Safety Board, which hasn’t been reported before, focuses on six events between December 2019 and January 2021 in which pilots of high-end Piper M600 aircraft reported loss of directional control while landing, according to a safety-board spokesman. Pilots involved in some of the accidents have expressed concern about potential problems affecting nose wheels.<br />All of the planes suffered damage after touching down on the runway, according to the NTSB spokesman; no fatalities or serious injuries were reported.<br />An informal group of M600 pilots involved in the accidents is pushing for government action, arguing the common link appears to be a nose-gear problem during otherwise normal touchdowns, causing the planes to veer from the center of the runway. Steering is controlled through pedals that also move the plane’s rudder, a vertical panel on the tail.<br />In two of the accidents, aviators at the controls said, efforts to control the direction of the nose failed as they careened off the strip, causing severe damage that resulted in scrapping aircraft that can cost about $3.5 million apiece.</td>

It was the first of its kind to show such a high level of efficacy for Pfizer’s vaccine for those aged 70 and over, due to the limited scope of the earlier clinical trials, according to the healthcare provider.<br />The study was done so that each vaccinated individual was tested against an unvaccinated person who had a similar profile, including their risk level for infection, risk level of developing serious illness and overall health.<br />“It is now unequivocal that Pfizer’s vaccine against the coronavirus is incredibly effective in real life one week after the second dose, just as was found in the clinical study,” said Ran Balicer, Clalit’s chief innovation officer and one of the study’s authors, in a Hebrew statement published Sunday with the study. The vaccine is even more effective two weeks after the second shot, he added.</td>

The current outbreak began in late January, but was only identified as the Ebola virus on Sunday, health officials said, suggesting it may have spread substantially in the intervening weeks.<br />The outbreak four years ago left more than 11,000 dead across West Africa. The new outbreak comes as the continent grapples with a steady rise of coronavirus infection rates, driven at least in part by a more transmissible variant first detected in South Africa.<br />The outbreak also comes shortly after Congo, which has faced more Ebola outbreaks than any other nation in the world, also detected cases in the restive region of North Kivu. Health experts hope the availability of an Ebola vaccine will help bring the outbreak swiftly under control.<br />Guinea’s health minister Remy Lamah on Monday said the government was successfully identifying those at risk and was well prepared to combat a new resurgence. “The government calls upon the population in the affected areas to respect prevention measures,” he said.</td>

Herein is the paradox of the left’s climate agenda: The less we use fossil fuels, the more we need them.<br />A mix of ice and snow swept across the country this weekend as temperatures plunged below zero in the upper Midwest and into the teens in Houston. Cold snaps happen—the U.S. also experienced a Polar Vortex in 2019—as do heat waves. Yet the power grid is becoming less reliable due to growing reliance on wind and solar, which can’t provide power 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<br />While Texas is normally awash in gas and oil, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees the state’s wholesale power market, urged residents this weekend to conserve power to avoid power outages. Regulators rationed gas for commercial and industrial uses to ensure fuel for power plants and household heating.<br />Texas’s energy emergency could last all week as the weather is forecast to remain frigid. “My understanding is, the wind turbines are all frozen,” Public Utility Commission Chairman DeAnn Walker said Friday. “We are working already to try and ensure we have enough power but it’s taken a lot of coordination.”<br />Blame a perfect storm of bad government policies, timing and weather. Coal and nuclear are the most reliable sources of power. But competition from heavily subsidized wind power and inexpensive natural gas, combined with stricter emissions regulation, has caused coal’s share of Texas’s electricity to plunge by more than half in a decade to 18%.</td>

      <td>The world’s largest music company is finally going solo, although not in the usual venue.<br />On Saturday, Universal Music Group’s French owner  Vivendi  said that it will spin off its music business and list it in the Netherlands later this year. It had already broached the idea of taking the record label that works with Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift public in 2022. Strong investor appetite for music assets since the pandemic began might explain the accelerated timeline. The news sent Vivendi’s share price up one-fifth on Monday.<br />Once the spinoff is complete, the French company steered by billionaire Vincent Bolloré will still hold one-fifth of Universal. Chinese tech giant  Tencent  will own 20% after recently exercising an option to up its stake in the music giant at a €30 billion—equivalent to $36 billion—valuation. The remaining 60% will be handed to Vivendi investors in a special distribution.<br />Shareholders have been pushing for the move as a way to unlock value in the music business for years. Vivendi’s shares have traded at an average discount of around 10% to its sum-of-the-parts valuation since late 2017, according to Barclays analysts. Soon, investors will be able to get exposure to Universal directly rather than having to buy shares in the sprawling French conglomerate.<br />Although organizers of live concerts are suffering during the pandemic, streaming services have benefited as consumers spend more time listening to music. Spotify grew its monthly active users to 345 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 27% increase compared with the same period a year earlier. Major record labels such as Universal and Warner are raking in more royalties from digital music platforms as a result. In the third quarter, Universal’s streaming revenue increased by 23%, the fastest growth it has recorded since early 2019.</td>

This conjecture indicates a fundamental misunderstanding and mischaracterization of Reed’s approach to learning.<br />First, a conventional letter grade for each course is recorded for every student at Reed. In fact, Reed is renowned for an absence of grade inflation that reflects the rigor of our academic program and the high standards set by the faculty. This being said, it is true that letter grades are not shared with students unless requested. Instead, students receive robust ongoing feedback on their work, including lengthy comments on papers and exams. This practice fosters content proficiency, more creativity and intellectual curiosity, and stronger outcomes. Furthermore, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives actually lead to a more meritocratic society by giving more students access to top-quality education.<br />Demonstrating the power of our approach, Reed ranks fourth in the nation among colleges and universities in the percentage of graduates who go on to earn doctoral degrees. Bottom line, we know that when meeting the challenges of “real life,” the grades you received in college don’t matter if you didn’t learn the material.<br />Prof. Kathryn C.

Doses produced by AstraZeneca and its manufacturing partners are expected to make up about a third of that effort, and more than half of the supply in the first half of the year.<br />“Today’s announcement…allows everybody to access vaccines,” said Deusdedit Mubangizi, who heads the WHO unit that approved the listing.<br />The initial approval covers doses produced by AstraZeneca and South Korea’s SK Bioscience.

      <td>Former Nigerian finance minister faces a tough task in reviving the influence of the organization</td>
      <td>The World Trade Organization picked its first female leader on Monday, offering a fresh start to an organization seeking to revive its influence over global economic rules.<br />The WTO’s 164 members unanimously backed former Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, an economist who also rose to the top ranks of the World Bank a decade ago, as director-general.<br />Ms. Okonjo-Iweala emerged as the consensus pick for the job in October when the WTO was due to decide on a new leader. However, her appointment was blocked by the Trump administration, which said she lacked experience on trade issues.<br />Earlier this month, shortly after South Korean Trade Minister Yoo Myung-Hee pulled out of the race, the Biden administration backed Ms. Okonjo-Iweala. She will be the WTO’s first African leader and her term, which starts March 1, will end in August 2025 unless renewed.<br />“The challenges facing the WTO are numerous and tricky, but they are not insurmountable,” Ms. Okonjo-Iweala said after being appointed. “There is light at the end of the tunnel if we work together in a transparent manner that builds trust.”</td>

Tali Farhadian Weinstein and Alvin Bragg worked as federal prosecutors in the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York, respectively. Lucy Lang, Diana Florence and Liz Crotty are alumni of the Manhattan district attorney’s office.<br />Running on the most reformist platforms are the three remaining candidates, all of whom have never worked as a prosecutor: Tahanie Aboushi, a civil rights attorney, Assemblyman Dan Quart, who is also a civil litigator, and Eliza Orlins, a Manhattan public defender.<br />All of them are campaigning on an overhaul of the justice system with promises that were once on the political fringes but are now hallmarks of the progressive prosecutor movement.<br />The Democratic primary, on June 22, is seen as the decisive election for the four-year job, as no Republican with strong appeal has emerged. Mr. Vance seems increasingly unlikely to run for a fourth term. A campaign spokesperson said she expects him to make an announcement about his intentions in the next few weeks.</td>

The show chronicles his rise as one of the country’s pioneering conceptual artists and includes everything from a rarely seen 1960 woodcut portrait of his mother, Dorothy, to his signature wordplay paintings. Also included are a pair of vellum drum skins on which he’s recently written slang he heard growing up, like “I never done nobody no harm.”<br />“Everything has an original source, and for me, that’s Oklahoma,” Mr. Ruscha said in a recent interview from his studio in Los Angeles.<br /><br />Since finding fame in the mid-1960s, Mr. Ruscha’s wry works have been steadily collected by major museums like the Museum of Modern Art and have resold for as much as $53 million at auction. Yet until now, he has never had a solo museum show in Oklahoma, where he lived from age 5 to 18.</td>

A decent man up against impossible odds, Gerald Ford’s self-estimation was shared by the American people, who drove him unceremoniously off the dealer’s lot of history and parked him out back.<br />There’s no such modesty in our modern political age. When a group of former Republican political consultants came together a little over a year ago to do what they could to destroy the Republican president, they saw no presumption in calling themselves the Lincoln Project.<br />Now that we know a little more about the performance and standards of the group, it looks more like the Edsel Project. Like its automotive predecessor, it was an expensive and wasteful machine that sucked a lot of money from overoptimistic, slightly credulous and ultimately very disappointed financial backers.<br />The collective’s name was intended to evoke not a high-caliber car but the highest-caliber president. That’s where it really fell short. The more we learn about the antics of this posse of political opportunists, the more resemblance they bear to the 45th president, whose character they deprecated, rather than the 16th, whose mantle they preposterously claimed.<br />Using a political campaign as a vessel for personal financial aggrandizement, thriving on the oxygen supplied by an endless succession of ratings-hungry television hosts, deploying a rare knack for nasty personal and vituperative rhetoric, and in the case of one of them, allegedly indulging a voracious appetite for sexual predation—if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, these guys must have idolized Donald Trump.

But President Biden last month signed an executive order launching a special 90-day enrollment period for ACA coverage, which starts Monday and lasts 90 days. The administration said the pandemic’s impact on healthcare and the economy called for an extension of the sign-up period.<br />The extension wasn’t expected, however, so its success may hinge on public awareness, which the administration is looking to increase through a $50 million marketing campaign.<br />The organizations, called navigators and which help individuals determine eligibility and pick plans, say they haven’t heard if they will also get more funding for the new period. Some navigators say they have already spent much of the federal grant money they received for the regular enrollment period, and they will need more.<br />The enrollment process has gotten more intensive and costly, the groups say, because the pandemic’s economic impact has left millions without jobs and seeking coverage on the exchanges. The navigators frequently assist hard-to-reach consumers including uninsured people and immigrants.</td>

      <td>Members of a WHO origin probe have conflicts of interest.</td>
      <td>The world needs to learn all it can about the origins of the novel coronarivus, and the World Health Organization has been investigating. But there’s increasing reason to question the effort due to China’s lack of cooperation and conflicts of interest on the WHO team.<br />A Beijing-approved WHO delegation recently concluded a 12-day visit to Wuhan, where the virus emerged more than a year ago. The group visited local hospitals and sites like the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and Huanan Seafood Market. But such field trips aren’t very helpful without unhindered access to raw data. The Chinese government, which controls research into Covid-19’s origin, has limited WHO access to such information.<br />Chinese officials are spinning that Covid-19 came from outside China. Some Communist Party functionaries have suggested the virus was imported through frozen food, but few scientists take the idea seriously. Many believe it arrived through “zoonotic spillover,” passing perhaps from bats, through another species, to humans. Another theory is that the virus came from a laboratory such as the one in Wuhan.<br />The WIV has conducted controversial “gain of function” research on coronaviruses. Such experiments can provide viruses with new capabilities—such as the ability to infect a different species. The U.S. State Department has said “several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019” and had “symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.” This is important to investigate.<br />Yet the recent WHO trip ended with a propaganda coup for Beijing. Peter Ben Embarek, head of the WHO team, declared the lab hypothesis “extremely unlikely” and “not in the hypotheses that we will suggest for future studies.” Mr. Embarek said he had spoken with lab personnel extensively, and “they’re the best ones to dismiss the claims.” But apparently the frozen-food theory was worth looking into.</td>

Ivy League conference presidents rebuffed the proposal almost immediately, conference executive director Robin Harris said.<br />It’s a sign of the fierce pressure the eight Ivy League universities are under as the conference heads into a possible second year without sports as the coronavirus pandemic drags on.<br />The Ivy League was the first conference to call off athletic competition back in March 2020. Nearly one year later, the conference is still on the sidelines with no clear plans to restart.<br />The extended pause that was once seen as prudent is now a point of contention.</td>

      <td>A day before the inauguration, as Lady Gaga rehearsed “The Star-Spangled Banner” in Washington, D.C., wildfires burned in Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Ventura counties in California, shocking climatologists who had never witnessed the state’s fire season extend into January. NASA had just announced that 2020 tied with 2016 for the warmest year on record. As the Covid-19 pandemic drove city dwellers to search for places that felt surer, safer—Vermont, Kansas, Idaho—the FBI began arresting Americans who had rioted in the U.S. Capitol. Online sales of “prepper” gear (gas masks, food preservation kits) were brisk.<br />Bill Gates was at his lakeside compound in Seattle, gearing up for his next effort to save the planet from mass extinction. For 20 years, Gates has been studying the twin global afflictions of disease and poverty. These efforts led him to consider climate change and its vexing impact on civilization. This month, Knopf will publish his latest book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster. Remarkably, given the state of the world, it is an optimistic, can-do sort of book, chock-full of solutions for a problem President Jimmy Carter began warning about in 1977.<br />Last month’s inauguration of President Joe Biden had a big influence on Gates’s outlook. An earlier draft of the book included measures for a second Donald Trump term. In November, after the election, he edited these parts out, including provisions for how U.S. state and foreign governments could account for an absence of federal support. Another Trump win, Gates says, would have left us “holding our breath for four years and trying not to turn blue.”<br />“I hope Joe Biden stays healthy,” he had told me during our first virtual interview in December, while seated in a glass-walled conference room at Gates Ventures known as the fishbowl, where he has been taking meetings and relying on the  Microsoft  Teams platform during the pandemic.<br />Seattle’s Lake Washington glints over his shoulder, where far below a distant motorboat leaves a wake as Gates slips into his preferred posture, slouched with an ankle across a knee in an ergonomic conference-room chair. Gates, who is 65, has already confronted intractable problems, from trying to eradicate polio to epic rivalries with Steve Jobs and Google. The co-founder of Microsoft also sounded the alarm early about the need to prepare for a global pandemic. Climate change is yet another challenge Gates has served onto his own plate.</td>

      <td>On Instagram, thousands of amateur fashion influencers post outfit photos each day—often begging their partners, friends or even their kids to be their personal photographers</td>
      <td>WE ARE LIVING in the golden age of the “fit pic.” Contrary to what it might sound like, a fit pic is not an indulgent, muscle-baring selfie. The term usually describes an outfit photo, documenting what a person is wearing from head to toe.<br />On Instagram, which launched in 2010, the fit pic has exploded into a mainstream phenomenon. Over 144,000 photos are currently hashtagged #fitpic. The posting of fit pic after fit pic has even become a full-time job for fashion influencers like Caroline Daur (over 2.8 million followers), Bryan Yambao (over 590,000 followers) and Reese Blutstein (over 328,000 followers). These careerist fit-posters are careful to “tag” each item they’re wearing, so their followers—and, maybe more importantly, the brands on display—know the handbag is from Gucci and the loafers are Loewe.<br />But countless average folks, with non-fashion day jobs, also occupy the fit-pic universe. While a full-fledged influencer might have the time and resources—including, say, a professional photographer—to capture just the perfect shot, part-time posters, who dash off a fit pic before ducking into their cubicles or between Zoom calls, do not. Which raises the question: Who exactly is taking the picture?<br />Several savvy Instagrammers I reached out to explained that they employ a self-timer and a tripod, lending pro polish to their solo fit pics. Others said they’ll beg patient friends to step in as their personal Annie Leibovitzes during coffee runs or after a social lunch.<br />Often though, the burden of shooting a fit pic falls on one’s significant other. Partners Justin Andrada, 24, and Melissa Yan, 25, both work in the financial sector in California’s Bay Area and share a passion for good clothes. During quarantine last year, they started @whatyoudressingfor, a joint Instagram account documenting their outfits. They’re lucky to have each other “on set”—one aims the iPhone while the other walks back and forth in frame with careful indifference. Then they switch roles. As Mr. Andrada explained, while working from home, they didn’t have a chance to show off their carefully calibrated outfits to friends or even strangers on the street. At least their Instagram followers (so far numbering 157) could appreciate Ms. Yan’s swirly Kapital fleece, or Mr. Andrada’s Evan Kinori jacket worn over a Lady White Co. hoodie.</td>

Several schools said Covid-19 made it difficult to gather the data they must submit to be ranked.<br />More than bragging rights hang in the balance—though there are plenty of those, too. Schools say a good showing in rankings can draw interest from prospective students, stoking application volumes, as well as plaudits or pans from alumni who continue to track their alma mater long after leaving campus.<br />Overall, 62% of programs plan to participate in some rankings, while 10% don’t plan to cooperate for any lists this year, according to a survey of business-school admissions officials by Kaplan, the education subsidiary of the Graham Holdings Co.<br />Bloomberg Businessweek suspended its 2020 ranking, the only major list to do so. Dozens of notable schools were missing from the Economist’s list published last month. Nine schools that normally take part in the FT’s list chose not to participate, a spokeswoman said.</td>

Over 150 million Americans are under some kind of winter advisory, the National Weather Service said Monday. The agency is forecasting heavy snow and significant ice from the southern plains and Ohio Valley to the Northeast.<br />Some analysts think investors have pushed oil prices above levels justified by supply and demand, but others expect them to remain buoyant.<br />“We haven’t seen any surprising factor that would stop this kind of rally, at least not yet,” said Carole Nakhle, chief executive of consulting firm Crystol Energy. Demand is on the mend, stockpiles of crude that ballooned last year are shrinking and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is holding millions of barrels a day back from the market, she added.</td>

The writing had been on the wall for the light-jet line for some time, as buyers shifted toward heavier private planes.<br />Ironically, some now see better prospects for the Learjet’s market segment than for most in the embattled aviation industry. Analysts at Jefferies expect private aircraft deliveries to rise 10% this year, after a 24% decline in 2020, led by light and medium-size jets. Heavy ones are forecast to keep falling.<br />This is partly because of travel restrictions on long-range destinations, but it could also be an early sign of yet another transformation within private aviation.<br />Last week, Dubai-based private-aviation company Vista Global said new members for its VistaJet subscription service, in which customers pay per hour flown and have guaranteed access to a plane within 24 hours, increased 29% last year.

      <td>Demand for corporate debt has offered lifelines to struggling firms that can borrow at interest rates once reserved for the safest type of bonds</td>
      <td>Investors’ near-insatiable demand for even the riskiest corporate debt is fueling a Wall Street lending boom, offering lifelines for struggling companies even as the coronavirus pandemic still drags on the economy.<br />Companies such as hospital operator  Community Health Systems Inc.  and newspaper publisher  Gannett Co. Inc.  have issued a record $139 billion of bonds and loans with below investment-grade ratings from the start of the year through Feb. 10, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. More than $13 billion of that debt had ratings triple-C or lower—the riskiest tier save for outright default—about twice the previous record pace.<br />Despite the onslaught of new bonds, riskier companies can now borrow at interest rates once reserved for the safest type of debt.<br />As of Friday, the average yield for bonds in the  ICE  BofA US High Yield Index—a group that includes embattled retailers and fracking companies—was just 3.97%. By comparison, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which carries essentially no default risk, was as high as 3.23% less than three years ago. The 10-year Treasury yielded around 1.2% Friday.<br />“At a high level, you have a meaningful imbalance between supply and demand,” said David Knutson, head of credit research for the Americas at  Schroders ,  the U.K. asset management firm. “The demand exceeds the supply for bonds.”</td>

      <td>Here are answers to some questions about the FDA review panels</td>
      <td>The Food and Drug Administration will convene an independent panel of experts Feb. 26 to recommend whether the  Johnson & Johnson  Covid-19 vaccine should be authorized for use in the U.S.<br />The hearing comes 22 days after J&J submitted its application and supporting test data. That’s on par with the timetable the FDA set for review of the vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and partner  BioNTech SE ,  but nearly a week longer than the one for the vaccine from  Moderna Inc.  Both were approved in December.<br />Some readers have questioned the amount of time needed to convene these review panels amid a global crisis and the urgent need to get vaccines distributed. Here’s a look at some of the issues involved:<br />FDA officials say they need the time to review the vaccine test data submitted by the company and make sure the conclusions are accurate. As part of that review, FDA scientists scrutinize data from individual study volunteers, paying close attention to those who have had side effects and to differences between various demographic groups.<br />The time frame is still much shorter than the usual FDA review of proposed new drugs and vaccines, which normally takes months.</td>

      <td>GOP hopefuls in several midterm races are tying themselves closely to the former president and his legacy</td>
      <td>A crop of Republicans has launched early campaigns across the country by hewing to former President Donald Trump’s political and policy legacy, betting that his enduring popularity with the GOP base can help propel them into office.<br />Josh Mandel, running for Senate in Ohio, dubs himself “President Trump’s number one ally in Ohio.” Former Rep. Mark Walker, who is running for Senate in North Carolina, joined a legal challenge of President Biden’s win in Pennsylvania and boasts that while in office he earned “the high praise of President Trump and Vice President Pence.”<br />Other pro-Trump Republicans have announced races for governor in Democratic-leaning states such as Virginia, where state Sen. Amanda Chase has dubbed herself “Trump in heels” for this year’s contest, and GOP strongholds such as Arkansas, where former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has already earned Mr. Trump’s endorsement for the 2022 race.<br />Many more Trump acolytes are weighing state and federal candidacies in the wake of his impeachment trial acquittal, waiting in the wings in battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania, a state Mr. Biden carried in 2020. The state is home to what is expected to be one of the most hotly contested Senate races next year, as Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) has said he won’t run for re-election.<br />“I think you’re going to see a lot of candidates in the primary who are quote-unquote pro-Trump. I think it’s just where people naturally find themselves,” said Charlie Gerow, a GOP strategist in Pennsylvania, adding that candidates of all factions would likely enter races across the state before the GOP eventually unifies against Mr. Biden. “As emotions start to calm down a little bit, the great unifying theme for Republicans is going to be the dramatic left turn of the Biden administration. It’s going to unite Republicans like nothing ever has.”</td>

      <td>GameStop and the Reddit-fueled frenzy around it have been celebrated as a triumph for small investors. But lots of them are in the red.</td>
      <td>Salvador Vergara was so enthusiastic about  GameStop Corp.  in late January that he took out a $20,000 personal loan and used it to purchase shares. Then the buzzy stock plunged nearly 80%.<br />GameStop’s volatile ride is hitting the portfolios of individual investors like Mr. Vergara who purchased the stock in a social-media-fueled frenzy. These casual traders say GameStop was their “YOLO,” or “you only live once,” trade. They bought around its late January peak, betting it would continue its astronomical climb. While some cashed out before it crashed, others who hung onto their shares are in the red.<br />Mr. Vergara, a 25-year-old security guard in Virginia, started investing four years ago after deciding he wanted to retire young. To save money, he drives a 1998 Honda Civic, eats a lot of rice and lives with his dad. He stashed his savings mostly in diversified index funds, which are now valued at about $50,000. Then Mr. Vergara, a longtime reader of the WallStreetBets page on Reddit, saw others posting about buying GameStop shares and the stock’s colossal rise.<br />He didn’t want to touch his index-fund investments, so instead he got a personal loan with an 11.19% interest rate from a credit union and used it to fund most of his GameStop purchase. He bought shares at $234 each.<br />GameStop shares started the year around $19, zoomed to nearly $350 (and almost hit $500 in intraday trading) in late January, and then began to spiral back to earth. The shares closed Friday at $52.40, down 85% from the peak close.</td>

      <td>U.S. stock futures edged higher Monday, following the major indexes’ climb to close at record highs last week.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 rose 0.4%, signaling an extension of last week’s muted gains that sent the broad-market index to an all-time high Friday. Contracts linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.5%. Markets in the U.S. are closed Monday for Presidents Day holiday.<br />Stock markets have climbed this year as investors look ahead to additional stimulus spending and an economic recovery as vaccination programs are rolled out around the world. Democrats plan to proceed this week with work related to President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid plan. World leaders are also set to jointly discuss the pandemic response at a virtual meeting of leaders from the Group of Seven industrialized nations on Friday.<br />Investors are focused on “fiscal stimulus, monetary stimulus, the recovery and earnings that are expected to come through in 2021,” said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers.<br />Monday is “going to be a quieter day with more of the same, more upward moves,” she added.</td>

      <td>Foreign-exchange markets have returned to their pre-pandemic placidity even as stock-market volatility remains elevated</td>
      <td>It is quiet in foreign-exchange markets. Maybe too quiet.<br />All the action has been in stocks this year, as any bored foreign-exchange trader will tell you. The market is usually a hub for raucous retail trading but has been largely quiescent during the meme-stock phenomenon.<br />The risk of a rise in currency volatility is something worth considering for investors with overseas exposure, as well as for corporate treasurers.<br />Stocks are usually more volatile than currencies. But the gulf between the Cboe Volatility Index—the familiar VIX “fear gauge” that measures the volatility of S&P 500 options—and the Cboe EuroCurrency Volatility Index, which does the same for euro-dollar options, is large by the standards of recent history. The same is true for volatility in other currency pairs.<br />The trend is relatively new. For most of the past decade, equity-market and currency volatility ground lower and lower in tandem, with occasional concurrent spikes. But after markets began to recover from last year’s pandemic-induced selloff, the relationship was disrupted: Foreign-exchange volatility resumed its decline, but equity-market volatility settled at a higher plateau.</td>
