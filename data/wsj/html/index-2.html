The increase was the smallest yearly rise since 2015, the Labor Department said.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal were expecting a 0.4% rise in consumer prices over the month and a 1.3% increase over the year.</td>

      <td>Yield on 10-year Treasury note edged lower after seven consecutive days of gains</td>
      <td>U.S. stock futures edged lower Wednesday ahead of a vote by lawmakers on impeaching President Trump during his final week in office.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked down about 0.2%, suggesting that the broad market index may be choppy after the opening bell. Nasdaq-100 futures also dropped about 0.2%.<br />Stocks have drifted lower this week after notching record highs in early January as investors weighed the prospect of fresh government spending against political turmoil in Washington and still rising Covid-19 cases. Energy and banking are among the best performers so far in the new year as investors bet on companies that fared poorly in 2020 and are likely to benefit as the economy recovers.<br />“Markets are going to remain choppy for a while, but through it all, we remain cautiously optimistic,” said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for State Street Global Advisors in Europe. “The amount of fiscal stimulus that is possible will protect risky assets, and there is still a lot of cash on the sidelines.”<br />U.S. inflation data out Wednesday showed that consumer prices increased only moderately last month, reflecting weak demand for a range of goods and services. Some economists expect inflation to pick up the pace as the economy grows faster later this year.</td>

      <td>McCarthy’s alliance with President Trump, long an asset within the party, could now be a hindrance to his goal of eventually becoming House Speaker</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—On the first day of this session of Congress, every single House Republican rallied behind Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in their vote for House speaker.<br />Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) ultimately won her fourth term as House speaker. However, it was a high-water mark of GOP support for the California Republican, whose unwavering alliance with President Trump and unexpected string of House GOP wins on Election Night brought him closer than ever before to his longtime goal of becoming speaker of the House.<br />Now, just 10 days later, Mr. McCarthy faces tensions within the House GOP and doubts in some Republican quarters about his own leadership over his refusal to publicly challenge Mr. Trump and his support for disputing President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral victory after a violent mob of Mr. Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.<br />The question for both Mr. McCarthy and his party as a whole is whether the path back to power leads through spurning Mr. Trump, or continuing to embrace him. In a previously unthinkable move, Mr. McCarthy was asking other Republicans whether he should press Mr. Trump to resign, according to someone familiar with the discussions.<br />“This is more than an inflection point for the Republican Party and specifically House Republicans,” said former GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida. The force of Mr. McCarthy’s personal charisma and deep relationships are “by far his greatest asset and it’s very powerful,” he said. “He has survived past challenges, but this is a low point in our country and he’s in the middle of it.”</td>

      <td>Decision follows probe into risks that deal would give LSE outsize influence over trading, clearing and data services</td>
      <td>Europe’s antitrust watchdog on Wednesday approved London Stock Exchange Group PLC’s $15 billion deal to acquire Refinitiv Holdings Ltd. with conditions, removing a key hurdle in the company’s bid to challenge Bloomberg LP,  S&P Global Inc.  and other industry heavyweights offering financial data.<br />The decision by the European Commission ends a monthslong probe into the risks of the deal. Concerns were raised that the deal could give the  LSE  undue market power over trading and clearing government bonds, interest rate derivatives, and the sale of financial data such as stock- and bond-price quotes.<br />LSE is betting on the Refinitiv deal, first announced in 2019, to help it create a financial data juggernaut. It has been diversifying its operations away from stock trading and other traditional exchange businesses toward clearing and higher-margin data services that feed the rise of quantitative trading and passive investing.<br />Still, the largest exchange company in Europe by market value agreed to several concessions to win regulatory approval for the tie-up. London has long been Europe’s biggest financial center, anchored in part by the LSE. The concessions—in place for 10 years—center on the LSE granting equal access to its venue data to all existing and future competitors, continuing clearing services in line with EU regulations despite Brexit and the saleBorsa Italiana Group. The concessions also include a dispute resolution system for third parties to go to if the LSE doesn’t comply with its commitments.<br />Following Britain’s breakoff from the European Union, the bloc is under pressure to bolster the capabilities of the continent’s financial institutions, some analysts say. The remedies for the LSE deal highlight that pressure: It potentially undercuts the exchange’s ability to generate additional revenue from the proposed deal in areas such as clearing and trading government bonds and derivatives, and cross-selling data and other products between its customers and those of Refinitiv.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The House was set to vote to impeach President Trump on Wednesday for an unprecedented second time, alleging he encouraged a mob to storm the U.S. Capitol as part of an effort to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s election win.<br />At least several Republicans are expected to join all Democrats in approving an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump with less than a week to go in his term, as law-enforcement officials nationwide are bracing for more potential violence in Washington and in state capitals. After the vote, expected in the afternoon, the matter would go to the Senate, where the date of a trial, and the level of Republican support, is uncertain.<br />The president, in his first public appearance since the Capitol riot last week, said Tuesday he had no regrets about his remarks to supporters. He called the efforts to remove him from office over his comments a continuation of what he has termed a Democrat witch hunt.<br />House Democrats’ article of impeachment  alleges that Mr. Trump “willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged—and foreseeably resulted in—lawless action at the Capitol, such as: ‘if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore.’”<br />Late Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence rejected a push from the House to invoke the 25th Amendment to oust Mr. Trump over his role in the Capitol riot, setting in motion the House vote Wednesday.</td>

      <td>Insects are inching their way to becoming a menu item on European dining tables after the bloc’s food safety regulator approved mealworms as safe for human consumption.<br />Wednesday’s announcement means the grubs—actually beetle larvae—could soon be ground down and used as a protein-rich flour to make pasta and bread, or consumed whole in stir-frys and other recipes. The next steps involve getting marketing and labeling approvals, and for the European Commission to sign off on the European Food Safety Authority’s decision.<br />The ruling provides a lift for companies such as Micronutris, a French edible insect farm which filed the application, and other startups including AgriProtein of South Africa, Netherlands-based Protix, and another French company, Ynsect, which is building a new farm with production capacity of more than 100,000 tons of bugs a year.<br />The bigger question, perhaps, is whether Europeans will want to eat bugs—long a popular snack in parts of Asia and Latin America—even if they are ground down into flour.<br />Giovanni Sogari, a researcher into social and consumption patterns at the University of Parma in Italy said many might find it difficult at first. “There are cognitive reasons derived from our social and cultural experiences, the so-called ‘yuck factor,’ that make the thought of eating insects repellent to many Europeans,” he said. “With time and exposure such attitudes can change.”</td>

      <td>President-elect Joe Biden says he plans to detail Thursday the first major legislation of his incoming administration: a massive new stimulus and relief package meant to address the continuing economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Mr. Biden has called the $900 billion relief plan Congress passed three weeks ago a mere “down payment” on what is needed. Here’s what we know about the new administration’s emerging plan:<br />“It will be in the trillions of dollars,” Mr. Biden said Friday, arguing that more spending sooner will reduce the long-term economic damage from the shutdowns. Earlier that day, the Labor Department announced said that job creation had stalled in December and that the U.S. economy lost more than nine million jobs in 2020, the worst labor-market performance in records dating to 1939. The first broad pandemic relief plan, enacted by Congress in March, cost roughly $2 trillion.<br />Mr. Biden and Democratic legislative leaders have repeatedly endorsed $2,000 direct payments to most Americans, calling the $600 checks in the December bill insufficient. The Biden plan would likely add $1,400 to the earlier payments to reach $2,000 total.<br />Mr. Biden said Friday there would be “billions of dollars” to speed up vaccine distribution, “tens of millions of dollars to help reopen our schools,” and “tens of billions of dollars” to allow state and local governments to keep paying teachers, police officers and health workers. He cited extending unemployment insurance and rent relief, and suggested he wants to modify the small-business assistance program to ensure more aid for minority-owned businesses. He also reiterated his support for raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from the current $7.25, though it is unclear if that will be part of the relief package.</td>

      <td>Mobile-phone chip giant  Qualcomm Inc.  said Wednesday that it has agreed to acquire a chip startup founded by former  Apple Inc.  engineers, adding to a wave of deals remaking the semiconductor industry.<br />Qualcomm said it plans to buy Nuvia Inc. and use the two-year-old company’s technology in its flagship smartphones, driver-assistance systems, laptops and networking infrastructure. The proposed all-cash transaction is valued at about $1.4 billion, Qualcomm said, before working capital and other adjustments.<br />Nuvia’s expertise in designing central processing units, Qualcomm said, would help it boost chip performance and power efficiency—characteristics that are vital to success in the hot 5G-networking market that Qualcomm has made a priority.<br />The San Diego-based chip company is also bolstering its talent pool with the planned acquisition, adding Nuvia’s staff and three founders, Gerard Williams III, Manu Gulati and John Bruno. Mr. Williams was lead chip architect at Apple before decamping to start Nuvia two years ago. Mr. Gulati and Mr. Bruno both worked at Apple and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google unit before Nuvia.<br />“The Nuvia team are proven innovators,” said Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm’s president who this month was named to replace Steve Mollenkopfas chief executive at midyear.</td>

Etsy’s stock has more than quadrupled over the past year. The seller of homemade goods is now valued at more than $23 billion, well over half the value of  eBay ,  despite the fact that it is predicted to generate less than 20% of the sales of its consumer-tech peer in the fourth quarter.<br />Etsy’s sky-high valuation has been earned through its rapid growth over the past few quarters. Sales in the second and third quarters grew an average of nearly 145% year on year, according to FactSet, and traffic and search trends from the last two months of the year suggest the fourth quarter will also be stellar.<br />Traffic to Etsy’s website rose an average of nearly 96% in November and December, according to SimilarWeb data, which Jefferies says is the highest level of monthly growth it has recorded from the company over the past two years. Meanwhile, growth in Google searches for Etsy also appears to have accelerated in the last two months of the year relative to October, though not as significantly. Together, these trends bode well for fourth-quarter results, which Etsy generally reports in late February.<br />But investors might want to start asking themselves whether year-end outperformance is now baked into the stock, and just how long Etsy can continue to grow at the meteoric pace necessary to maintain its current valuation.</td>

      <td>The Republican Party has already seen its share of corporate PAC donations shrink compared with eight years ago</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The challenge by some Republicans to the 2020 election results last week is fueling a rift between the party and big companies and could accelerate changes to the GOP’s fundraising base.<br />In the week since more than 100 Republicans objected to the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s win, at least a dozen U.S. corporations said they would reconsider donating money from their political-action committees to lawmakers who sided with President Trump’s challenge to the results. Dozens more have said they are halting all political giving in response to the events last week, when supporters of Mr. Trump attacked the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying Mr. Biden’s victory.<br />The Republican Party has already seen its share of corporate PAC donations shrink compared with eight years ago, according to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. In the 2012 election, after the GOP had won control of the House during the Obama administration, Republicans received 63% of the $365 million total given by business PACs. In 2020, Republicans got 57% of corporate PAC donations.<br />Employees in some key business sectors have also shifted their political giving toward Democrats, data from the Center for Responsive Politics indicates. Between the 2012 and 2020 elections, Republicans have seen declines in the share of donations to candidates, PACs and party committees from employees in the securities and investment, finance, business services and real-estate sectors.<br />In the Senate, where Republicans will try to win back the majority in the next election, some Republican lobbyists and business executives said they are worried about facing backlash if they steer company PAC donations to the GOP’s campaign committee, which is run by Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.), who objected to the certification of Mr. Biden’s election. Outside political groups, such as one affiliated with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), are also expected to take a hit.</td>

Automated home flipper  Opendoor Technologies  embodies three of them at the same time.<br />Back in September, the online real-estate platform made a splash announcing its merger with one of venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya’s prized special-purpose acquisition companies as a means to a public offering. The move essentially combined a few of 2020’s hottest trends: a SPAC, a disruptive touchless technology and housing fever. Together, they have brought much hype to an unproven business that might have lost a key competitive edge.<br />While the onset of the pandemic temporarily derailed the iBuying business, which is focused on buying and reselling homes electronically, more recent trends have played to its strengths. Low interest rates and the rise of remote work have brought new buyers into the market, while skyrocketing home prices have enticed homeowners to try to cash out while demand is hot.<br />Opendoor shares closed their first day of trading on their own in December with a market value of roughly $17 billion based on the number of shares outstanding listed in a filing last month. That is up from a post-money valuation of just $3.8 billion following the company’s last venture raise early in 2019, according to PitchBook.<br />Having launched in 2014, Opendoor had established a sizable first-mover advantage in the iBuying market, with revenue growing 158% to $4.7 billion in 2019. That compares with just $1.4 billion in 2019 revenue for Zillow’s iBuying business.</td>

The pandemic has accelerated the growth of at-home fitness apps, which have relied on music as a draw to live-streamed and on-demand classes led by remote instructors—who have become much like influencers and DJs in their own right.<br />While streaming on music services like Spotify and Apple Music has increased during pandemic lockdowns, closed venues, restaurants and retailers where music is played, as well as the pause on touring and live shows, has weighed on the music business. At the same time, videogaming, social video on apps like TikTok and digital fitness have taken off—each with opportunities labels, publishers and other copyright owners are eyeing for music.<br />The digital fitness market has taken off with  Peloton Interactive Inc.’s  stationary bikes,  Lululemon Athletica Inc.’s  purchase of Mirror,  Apple Inc.’s  introduction of Fitness+, as well as upstarts like Supernatural VR and Hydrow.<br />Equinox launched its Variis mobile app in March, giving its bricks-and-mortar gym members free access to virtual classes just as stay-at-home orders and lockdown restrictions were sweeping through cities across the country.

      <td>Online sales more than doubled in November and December while store-based sales ticked higher</td>
      <td>Target Corp.  said Wednesday that winter holiday sales rose solidly as more shoppers bought goods online, adding to a series of strong results from the retailer during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Comparable sales, those from stores or digital channels operating for at least 12 months, rose 17% in November and December from a year earlier. Store-based sales increased 4.2%, while digital sales more than doubled during that period, driven by same-day online pickup and delivery orders, the company said.<br />“The momentum in our business continued in the holiday season with notable market share gains across our entire product portfolio,” Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said in a statement. Target has invested heavily in recent years to expand its online business largely by sourcing online orders from stores’ shelves. Around 95% of Target sales in the period were sourced from stores, the company said.<br />Retailers are reporting mixed holiday results. Target and other large retailers have generally performed well during the pandemic. Most of the top performers are retailers that either stayed open during early lockdowns or those that sell food, home goods or other products that are increasingly in demand as more shoppers stay home. Many of the top performers had robust e-commerce businesses already in place before the pandemic and are now benefiting as more shopping shifts online.<br />Earlier this week  Lululemon Athletica Inc.  raised its fourth-quarter financial guidance after a strong holiday season as more shoppers bought athletic gear and comfortable clothing.</td>

      <td>The gyrating price of bitcoin has made headlines again this year, as has growing interest from institutional investors. But most vanilla financiers have more to lose than win by diving into digital assets.<br />Open interest in  CME ’s  bitcoin futures has surged by more than 250% since the beginning of October. Large trade sizes and the fact that bitcoin doesn’t have to be held directly mean CME’s system is considered a benchmark of activity by institutional investors.<br />Crypto-focused hedge funds and individual buyers are free to invest as they like, of course. Buying a volatile asset without cash flow in a euphoric market is a risk they are willing to take. It has certainly paid off for those with iron stomachs.<br />The calculation for mainstream institutions should be very different. Many will take a small allocation that will make little difference to their bottom line if prices surge, but they will still be left to explain to clients why they invested in an entirely speculative asset if things go sour. By investing in such small amounts, they are crossing the Rubicon without getting to enter Rome.<br />Eighty-one percent of investment into the funds run by Grayscale Investments in the third quarter came from institutional investors, according to the company. Grayscale’s flagship Bitcoin Trust had assets under management of $1.9 billion at the start of 2020, $4.7 billion by the end of September and $21.1 billion as of Tuesday.</td>

      <td>People have more faith in their own employer than leaders in government and business, according to a new study released Wednesday.<br />Overall, trust in institutions remains low, but business earned the highest marks, said the annual survey by the public-relations firm Edelman. The poll represented the company’s 21st analysis of public trust in major institutions and surveyed more than 33,000 people in 28 countries over the past several months.<br />More than half of U.S. respondents, 54%, said they trust business, which was more than was said for nongovernmental organizations, government or media. Nearly three-quarters of U.S. respondents said their own employer, in particular, was a mainstay of trust.<br />“Business has to help the country knit itself back together, to be the connective tissue, while the politics are sorted out,” said Richard Edelman, the company’s chief executive.<br />The findings continue a trend. Last year’s poll also showed crumbling trust in institutions amid anxiety about corruption, future employment prospects and the wage gap between the rich and middle classes.</td>

      <td>Delays in administering Covid-19 vaccine shots pose a fresh risk to investors who bet on a speedy vaccination process to help risky U.S. companies bounce back from the pandemic.<br />The approval of coronavirus vaccines made by  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna Inc.  last year propelled rescue financing packages for several cash-strapped companies, supplying them with what investors thought would be enough liquidity to keep them afloat until widespread immunity took hold.  Cineworld Group  PLC,  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,   Carnival Corp.  and other companies with bleak outlooks because of the pandemic found financial lifelines to tide them over.<br />These deals continued a trend dating back months before the vaccines were approved, as actions taken by the Federal Reserve and Congress, coupled with investors’ eagerness to continue lending, kept the corporate default rate well below analysts’ expectations.<br />But the sluggish rollout of the vaccines is now undermining the timeline that investors projected when extending emergency credit. The U.S. government fell well short of its goal of vaccinating 20 million Americans in 2020, having administered just 2.8 million doses by the end of last year, according to federal figures, in part due to differing state policies that have led to confusion and shipment delays. The emergence of the more-contagious U.K. coronavirus mutation in the U.S. has also raised the likelihood of further government restrictions and consumers being more cautious about leaving their homes.<br />So far, more than 25.4 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, but only 8.9 million Americans have received a shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</td>

      <td>Trump administration lawyers have concluded that it would be illegal to forgive all or some of Americans’ student debt through an executive action—as congressional Democrats have urged the incoming Biden administration to do—arguing that such a move would require Congress to pass a law.<br />Education Department lawyers lay out their reasoning in a memo dated Tuesday to Betsy DeVos, who resigned last week as education secretary. The internal agency memo, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, was signed by a political appointee and isn’t binding.<br />Congressional Democrats and progressive groups have urged President-elect Joe Biden to forgive most or all of the $1.6 trillion in federal student debt unilaterally in his first 100 days in office. They argue that existing law authorizes the executive branch to forgive student debt without any action from Congress.<br />“We believe the Secretary does not have the statutory authority to cancel, compromise, discharge, or forgive, on a blanket or mass basis, principal balances of student loans, and/or to materially modify the repayment amounts or terms thereof,” Reed Rubinstein, the Education Department’s principal deputy general counsel, wrote in the memo to Mrs. DeVos. Mr. Rubinstein’s tenure will end along with those of other appointees when the new administration takes office Jan. 20.<br />Mr. Biden, a Democrat, has said he supports writing off $10,000 in student debt for every borrower as part of a package of measures to help households financially during the pandemic. About 43 million Americans owe $1.6 trillion in federal student loans.</td>

      <td>Hedge funds score gains when blank-check companies rise after announcing deals to take startups public</td>
      <td>Sudden excitement about the flurry of startups going public through so-called blank-check companies is enriching some of the biggest players in finance, particularly hedge funds.<br />The gains come through the unique rights given to early investors in special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, which look to acquire promising startups and take them public. As the vehicles become more popular, the hedge funds that invest in them early on, such as Magnetar Capital, Glazer Capital and Israel Englander’s Millennium Management, can earn lofty returns without much risk.<br />Here is how the trade typically works: Hedge funds give the SPAC money for up to two years while it looks for a merger target. In return, they get a unique right to withdraw their investment before a deal goes through that minimizes any loss on the trade. At the same time, the potential return for early investors is huge if the SPAC shares rise because they also initially receive shares and warrants giving them the right to buy more shares at a specified price in the future.<br />Wall Street’s recent exuberance has engulfed SPACs, with day traders and large institutions alike pouring money into shell companies pursuing startups tied to themes such as green energy or sports betting. Recent SPACs have surged immediately after announcing deals to take startups public, giving the hedge funds opportunities to sell and turn quick profits.<br />One example came Jan. 7, when shares of the venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya’s  Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. V  advanced 63% after it said it is combining with Social Finance Inc. to take the financial-technology company public.</td>

A prominent New York real-estate lawyer threatened to complain to California’s governor if state health officials there didn’t use BGI’s tests.<br />Some of the company’s testing supplies were used in Nevada, according to the head of the state’s Covid-19 task force. BGI has tried in the past to get into the U.S. market and has sold testing equipment to U.S. private labs that advertise their work for government clients.<br />In March, an FBI special agent who monitors biotech threats for the Department of Health and Human Services told an HHS advisory committee that government agencies should be wary of doing business with the company, which, he said, had a history of misusing personal data. The agent, Ed You, echoed warnings from other law-enforcement, security and military-intelligence officials.</td>

That puts it well ahead of the S&P 500, the MSCI World and the Euro Stoxx indexes, despite the U.K. being among the hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The recent market rally doesn’t make up for its stark underperformance since the U.K. voted to leave Europe in 2016. In dollar terms, the FTSE 100 is still below where it closed on June 23, 2016, the day of the Brexit referendum.<br />Britain did manage to conclude a slim new trade deal with the European Union on Christmas Eve, eliminating fears that it might break away from the bloc at the end of 2020 with all its exports subject to tariffs and restrictions. But the bare-bones deal leaves much to be negotiated. The British pound hasn’t benefited either, confounding those who believe that U.K. assets are now more attractive.<br />As investors move money into U.K. assets, they need to buy the British currency, and that should lift the pound. Savvas Savouri, chief economist at Toscafund Asset Management, a $4 billion hedge fund, believes the pound’s fundamental value in euros is about €1.30 apiece. But since Dec. 23, it remained flat at €1.11 before rising to €1.12 on Wednesday.</td>

Boeing didn’t acknowledge any wrongdoing.<br />The settlement comes less than a week after Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion as part of a settlement resolving a criminal charge that it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the agency’s safety review of the 737 MAX jet. Prosecutors laid out a pattern of activity by two Boeing pilots to deceive regulators about a software system that ultimately led to two crashes in which a total of 346 people died.<br />Boeing acknowledged responsibility in that case, agreeing to pay a $244 million fine and pledging to tighten internal ethics rules and compliance standards.</td>

Mimecast, in a Tuesday blog post, said the hackers were able to obtain a digital certificate used by the company to access its customers’  Microsoft  365 office productivity services.<br />The Mimecast hackers used tools and techniques that link them to the hackers who broke into Austin, Texas-based SolarWinds Corp., according to people familiar with the investigation. The link to the SolarWinds hackers was reported earlier by Reuters.<br />U.S. government officials have blamed Russia for the SolarWinds attack. Moscow has denied involvement.<br />Most of the companies and government agencies identified as victims to date were compromised via a piece of network management software called Orion that belongs to SolarWinds. But the Mimecast case, in which the vendor’s customers became targets, highlights that not all victims had to be SolarWinds users themselves to be targeted.</td>

      <td>The storming of the U.S. Capitol last week has left millions of Americans wondering about the health of their democracy. Now imagine the damage if this is followed by political violence across the country leading up to the inauguration.<br />That’s the worry caused by an FBI warning about armed protests planned for all 50 states and the U.S. Capitol starting Jan. 16—with a threat of a “huge uprising” if President Trump is removed via the 25th amendment.<br />The warning comes via an internal FBI bulletin that reads in part: “On 8 January, the FBI received information on an identified group calling for others to join them in ‘storming’ state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings in the event POTUS is removed as President prior to Inauguration Day. This identified group is also planning to ‘storm’ government offices including in the District of Columbia and in every state, regardless of whether the states certified electoral votes for Biden or Trump, on 20 January.”<br />It’s hard to know what to make of this without insight into the actors, but after last week governors, mayors and police will have to take it seriously. That means mobilizing the resources and manpower to keep law enforcement from being overwhelmed.<br />The moment also requires calls for restraint and nonviolence from both the left and right. Steve Scalise, the second-ranking Republican in the House and himself a victim of a politically motivated shooter, makes his plea nearby for politicians to tone down rhetoric that can inspire violence.</td>

      <td>Most Americans know little about modern Asian history. That’s too bad—yesterday’s upheavals are likely to be tomorrow’s, too.</td>
      <td>Modern Asian history may be the most important subject that most educated Americans know almost nothing about. With the center of gravity of world politics now firmly located in the Indo-Pacific, many are looking for ways to deepen their understanding of the most populous, fastest-growing and potentially most dangerous region in the world. Tim Harper’s “Underground Asia: Global Revolutionaries and the Assault on Empire” is an excellent place to start. It is a clearly written, brilliantly researched examination of the people and movements that shaped Asia’s course in the 20th century and continue to influence the continent today.<br />In the early part of the century, when Mr. Harper’s narrative begins, European colonialism seemed permanently established in Asia. In 1906, the power of the Netherlands in what is now Indonesia reached its grim apogee as Dutch forces shelled the royal capital of the ancient Balinese kingdom of Badung until the battered, unarmed defenders, in a final act of defiance, “processed out of the palace and threw themselves, singing, at the Dutch automatic weapons.” An estimated 1,000 were killed.<br />The early arrival of the Industrial Revolution had given western nations, especially Britain, what appeared to be an insurmountable industrial, economic, political and military supremacy. Prospectors, planters, industrialists, missionaries and soldiers descended on traditional Asian societies and, shunting hapless native rulers aside almost everywhere, began to modernize Asia to suit western needs. Steamship lines connected ports; vast urban complexes grew up where trade routes crossed; and railroads carried the agents, the goods and the ideas of empire deep into the countryside.<br />European power in Asia looked unshakable, but only 43 years after the fall of Badung the Dutch were forced to recognize Indonesian independence amid the abject regional collapse of European rule.<br />How Asia’s ragtag revolutionaries turned that fierce desire for freedom into movements that could overcome European advantages in technology and organization is the story Mr. Harper wants to tell. It’s an ambitious assignment. Then as now, Asia was an overwhelmingly diverse region, and those differences were in many cases exacerbated by the ways that French, Dutch, British and Japanese colonialism overwrote preexisting cultural linkages with new patterns and influences. Often relying on colonial police archives, Mr. Harper reconstructs the obscure lives of the revolutionary generation who hammered out the ideas and built the movements that would lead Asia through the astonishingly rapid destruction of some of the largest and most powerful empires the world had ever seen.</td>

      <td>Delivering shots by age will help the most vulnerable faster.</td>
      <td>The Trump Administration said Tuesday it would release vaccine doses that it had been holding back for second inoculations and send more shots to states that are administering them faster. Thank you. This should speed up vaccinations by putting more pressure on states to relax the bureaucratic and political controls that have slowed the rollout.<br />“Every vaccine dose that is sitting in a warehouse rather than going into an arm could mean one more life lost or one more hospital bed occupied,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a press briefing. He’s right. Only 9.3 million of the 27.7 million vaccine doses that have been shipped to states have been administered.<br />Blame convoluted and rigid eligibility rules that have focused too much on “equity”—i.e., politics. Operation Warp Speed apportions doses to states, and then states decide how to allocate them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance to states on how to prioritize vaccines focuses on worker occupation, but many states have added to the morass.<br />New York has been one of the worst, creating a complex formula for ranking health-care employees based on underlying risk factors, age, occupation and hospital department, among other things. Many hospitals had spare vaccines because large numbers of health-care workers declined to be vaccinated. Yet state rules barred offering shots to others.<br />The  Pfizer  and Moderna mRNA shots have to be used within hours of opening vials. When hospitals and clinics had leftover shots after vaccinating everyone who wanted one, nurses often had to go on a scavenger hunt to find someone in the Governor’s top priority group. Many doses went to waste, and hundreds were left unopened on shelves.</td>

      <td>Obama’s engagement failed to change Havana’s behavior.</td>
      <td>After a five-year hiatus, the State Department on Monday returned Cuba to its list of state sponsors of terrorism. What took so long?<br />State’s practice of listing countries that “have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism” has been in place since 1979. President Reagan added the tropical communist regime in 1982. Cuba remained so designated until President Obama removed it from the list in 2015 in its campaign to normalize relations. But Havana doesn’t want to be normal, and it has deepened and broadened its commitment to terrorism.<br />The collapse of Venezuela’s democracy over two decades has been run out of Havana by Cuba’s military-intelligence apparatus. The once-sovereign South American nation is now essentially a Cuban satellite used as a base for transnational crime and terrorism. A 2019 report by the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism found that “Cuba and Venezuela continued to provide permissive environments for terrorists.”<br />The report noted that “individuals linked” to dissident members of the Colombian drug-trafficking group FARC, “who remain committed to terrorism notwithstanding the peace accord,” as well as the smaller rebel National Liberation Army (ELN) and “Hizballah sympathizers” were in Venezuela. Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro, who survives in power thanks to Cuba, “has openly welcomed former FARC leaders who announced a return to terrorist activities,” the report said.<br />Cuba also welcomes and protects terrorists at home. “Members of the ELN who were in Havana to conduct peace talks with the Colombian government since 2017 also remained in Cuba,” the report found. “Cuba, citing peace negotiation protocols, refused Colombia’s request to extradite 10 ELN leaders after that group claimed responsibility for the January 2019 bombing of a Bogotá police academy, which killed 22 and injured 87 others.”</td>

So watch for efforts to exploit Americans’ outrage at the Capitol assault in service of tactics that seek to spread the blame far and wide for political or ideological ends.<br />Stuart Stevens, a senior advisor to the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, tweeted Saturday that “we are constructing a database of Trump officials & staff that will detail their roles in the Trump administration & track where they are now.” He added: “No personal info, only professional. But they will be held accountable & not allowed to pretend they were not involved.”<br />The Lincoln Project is a well-funded political action group, run mostly by former GOP consultants, that made ads for Democrats in the 2020 election cycle. We often disagreed, especially with the group’s effort to unseat principled GOP Senators, but never begrudged donors exercising their First Amendment right to influence the political process.<br />It’s something else to turn fire on former public servants in private life. Mr. Stevens tells us in an email that he’s doing nothing more than Wikipedia does with its pages listing past Administration alumni. But then why broadcast his stigmatizing intentions?<br />The only reason for an anti-Trump group to publicize the employment information of former officials is to deter employers from hiring them. If they are hired, progressive employees could scour the list and create petitions for them to be fired or doxed. This will deepen America’s civic strife.</td>

      <td>Danes face threats from Beijing for planning a fake climate crisis to help Ted Hui get to the West.</td>
      <td>‘We say the Chinese Communist Party got cheated by two Danish boys,” says Thomas Rohden, 25. Last month, he and his friend Anders Storgaard, 26, masterminded a plan to sneak a dissident out of Hong Kong. For pulling off a daring feat, they may face consequences that reveal much about Beijing’s global ambitions.<br />Messrs. Rohden and Storgaard belong to opposing political parties, but both are members of the Danish China Critical Society, a group focused on the Communist Party’s human-rights abuses. The two men met Hong Kong opposition members visiting Copenhagen last February. “That opened my eyes to how important it is for us young people who are democratically involved to stick together,” Mr. Storgaard says.<br />They kept in touch with Ted Hui, a 38-year-old pro-democracy lawmaker. All three are as mischievous as they are principled—Mr. Hui once set off a stink bomb during a Legislative Council session as an act of protest against legislation that threatened free expression.<br />Supporters of the freedom movement in Hong Kong have repeatedly been assaulted since 2019, and Mr. Hui noticed strangers had begun to follow him and his family. Police arrested him numerous times for protesting in the streets and in the Legislative Council. Mr. Hui got out on bail, but greater legal peril loomed. Last summer Beijing imposed a national-security law on Hong Kong that outlaws all forms of dissent, on penalty of life in prison. (Mr. Hui hasn’t been charged under that law.)<br />Messrs. Rohden and Storgaard contacted their friend after he was released on bail. Mr. Hui responded with a strange suggestion. As a former member of the Legislative Council’s Environmental Affairs Panel, he wanted to come to Denmark to talk about climate change. Beijing purports to care about the environment, and Mr. Storgaard and Mr. Rohden intuited this might be a chance for Mr. Hui to escape. So they made an audacious plan: to stage a fake climate conference in Copenhagen in early December, invite their friend, and get him to safety.</td>

      <td>The man who shot me in 2017 and the Capitol Hill rioters all were radicalized by extreme rhetoric.</td>
      <td>I’m still angry after last week’s events at the Capitol. I mourn for Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died from injuries inflicted by rioters, and worry about the morale and safety of his fellow officers. My concerns continue for the safety of my colleagues, staff and members of the press who work in Washington. President Trump should have denounced the attack unequivocally as it was taking place.<br />What happened last Wednesday went well beyond any candidate’s legal right to contest an election and is another glaring sign that public discourse has gotten out of control. With only days to go until President-elect Biden’s Inauguration, our national temperature is far too high. A powder keg had been smoldering long before Wednesday’s events. For the sake of our country, politicians and media figures—of both parties—have to tone down their rhetoric.<br />In 2017, I was shot on a baseball field by a politically motivated gunman. The deranged shooter was heavily influenced by the demonization of congressional Republicans by some Democratic politicians, whose statements were amplified by the mainstream media. In the aftermath of my shooting, I made a conscious decision not to hold anybody but the gunman responsible for that day’s events.<br />It would, however, be naive to think the shooter arrived at his decision in a vacuum. It would be equally naive to think that the Capitol rioters arrived at their decisions in a void. Violent rhetoric helps radicalize people. Republicans and Democrats alike must have the moral clarity to call this language out whenever it is spoken, not only when it comes from the other side of the political aisle.<br />Many Democrats who were rightfully quick to join us in condemning last week’s events at the Capitol were noticeably silent over the summer. In those months, Americans watched looters ransack small businesses while cities went up in flames. Radical progressives attacked police precincts and federal courthouses, and leftist protesters clashed repeatedly with police. In Minneapolis, Kenosha, Wis., Seattle’s “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,” the District of Columbia and other cities, many elected officials outright enabled a cruel disregard for life, property and the rule of law in the name of social justice. Many in the media cheered the violence. “Show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful,” CNN’s Chris Cuomo said.</td>

      <td>President Trump, speaking in public for the first time since he rallied his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol before the riot last week, attacked Democrats for seeking to impeach him again and aired grievances about  Twitter  and the incoming administration, in an event meant to showcase his immigration policy.<br />“The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country,” Mr. Trump said in Alamo, Texas. The House is preparing to cast a series of votes aimed at ousting or impeaching the president over his role in last week’s violence at the Capitol.<br />As concerns mount about the possibility of more riots around Inauguration Day, the president also called for “no violence,” after sending mixed messages on the riot in recent days. He condemned the violent protests in a taped video last week, before vowing that his supporters would “not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!”<br />“We believe in respecting America’s history and traditions, not tearing them down,” Mr. Trump said. “We believe in the rule of law and not in violence.”<br />The president showed little regret for his actions ahead of last week’s riot, which followed a monthslong effort by Mr. Trump and his allies to rally his supporters with baseless claims of a rigged election. Speaking to reporters on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before taking off for Texas, Mr. Trump denied any responsibility for the violence perpetrated by his supporters at the Capitol last week, saying his speech before the riot was “totally appropriate.”</td>

With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed.”<br />Judged against this standard, can impeaching President Trump and removing him from office succeed? A Quinnipiac University survey released on Monday suggests that it cannot.<br />Yes, 52% of Americans favor removing President Trump from office, compared with 45% who oppose it. But the partisan divisions are deep. While 89% of Democrats support this course, 87% of Republicans oppose it, and independents are split.<br />Underlying this stark divide are radically divergent interpretations of the November presidential election and its aftermath. Some 73% of Republicans believe that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Only 5% of Democrats do.<br />These dueling beliefs have consequences. Seventy-three percent of Republicans think that Mr. Trump’s actions since the election have aimed at protecting democracy; 95% of Democrats think that he has been undermining democracy.</td>

      <td>As herd immunity comes nearer, inoculate where it will do the most good.</td>
      <td>A new strain of the coronavirus is preliminarily and tentatively estimated to be 50% more transmissible than the current strain. This will be yet more incentive for those already highly motivated not to spread or catch it. Nobody really knows what “50% more” means in this context, but all the same social distancing and mask-wearing recommendations apply. If it takes 50% more diligence to achieve the same virus-suppressing effect, you see the problem: Many people already find the current level of diligence unsustainable or not worth their effort.<br />It is pretty apparent that, in countries where social distancing cannot be enforced by bayonet or mega-Trumpian border control, cases are growing faster than hospital capacity. The vaccine has not (contrary to my hope) caused many to redouble their efforts with a light at the end of the tunnel. Millions who know better than ever now that most cases are mild or symptomless seem to be telling themselves, with the elderly being vaccinated, their own job is done.<br />A typical sentence since last summer has been: I went to the grocery store and everybody was wearing a mask. The first part of the sentence is the problematic part. People are crowding together again. A decline in social distancing has defeated an increase in mask wearing.<br />Celebrity is fickle even if you’re a coronavirus mutation. By July, the dominant variant in the U.S. and Europe had become different from the Chinese strain that served as the basis for our then-hatching vaccines. As it turns out, the vaccines nevertheless are potent against the “G” strain and likely to be against the celebrated new mutation from the U.K. But it won’t be true of future variants. Once a vaccine starts going into millions of arms, that’s when selective pressure ramps up on a virus to defeat our vaccines. Interestingly, though scientists aren’t sure whether natural or artificial vaccination confers better immunity, they’re pretty sure the natural kind will prove more robust against evolution because it responds to a broader diversity of virus features.<br />More information is always helpful. Multiple experts, in honor of the newly recognized variant, want accelerated genomic sampling to hunt for new strains. Great idea. But it does underline our odd indifference toward measuring current spread accurately. Joe Biden, the Brits and others suddenly are realizing their dainty and over-categorizing answers about who should get the vaccine first are slowing its delivery. Also hurting is the likelihood that one-third of people soon to be lining up will already have been vaccinated by nature, many of them not knowing it.</td>

Scott Rechler, chief executive of RXR Realty, said that his company has identified six retail locations for Manhattan testing centers, one in a former Starbucks.<br />Mr. Rechler said the centers, which won’t be charging rent, will likely start opening in February and will all be open by the end of March. “The idea is to have the infrastructure in place in the middle of February and then by March, you’ll start seeing people come back to the workplace,” he said.<br />William Rudin, the head of one of the city’s real estate dynasties, said his company will likely provide at least two locations—one in Midtown Manhattan and the other in downtown—for Rudin office tenants.</td>

      <td>The complete recordings—all 775 hours—of the historic Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders has been released online.</td>
      <td>Hermann Göring’s German speaking voice is pinched, high-pitched, pedantic. He snaps condescendingly at the prosecutor who presents him with one wartime document after another: “I have to read it first.” “No, that is in no way correctly translated.” “Here is a mistake already.” “That is not quite correct.”<br />In these, his final public appearances—as a defendant in the International Military Tribunal Trial of Major War Criminals held in Nuremberg, Germany, from November 1945 to October 1946—he speaks with almost singsong mockery, as if he were looking down at lesser mortals. He relishes tweaking the U.S. chief prosecutor and justice of the Supreme Court, Robert H. Jackson, derailing his lines of questioning with challenges over trivia. Göring is so petty and pettifogging, you can almost forget that he had been the demonic creator of the Gestapo, the supreme commander of the Luftwaffe and Hitler’s chosen successor.<br />Göring was one of 24 high-level political and military Nazi leaders put on trial (two of the defendants never made it to the dock—one because of suicide, the other because of illness). Following the verdicts of judges from the four Allied powers (the U.S., Britain, France and the Soviet Union), 10 were hanged, three were acquitted and others were given long sentences. Martin Bormann—Hitler’s private secretary—rumored to be dead (as he was) was sentenced to death in absentia. And Göring notoriously cheated the executioner, killing himself the night before his scheduled trip to the gallows.<br />Hearing these voices as they accuse, excuse, avoid, rationalize and lie is quite different from reading the trial record. English transcripts have long been available as part of Yale University’s Avalon Project and as part of the Nuremberg records at the Library of Congress. Now, during the trial’s 75th anniversary, the complete recordings have been put online for the first time by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, along with the 37 reels of film introduced into evidence at the trial. The International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, the custodian of the original materials—1,942 gramophone discs containing 775 hours of hearings—arranged the digitization of its archive, collaborating with the Holocaust museum in Washington and the Mémorial de la Shoah in Paris.<br />It isn’t easy listening, and not only because the museum’s awkward web presentation makes any selective exploration difficult. While the trial employed simultaneous translation of German, English, French and Russian—the first time the technique was used on this scale—these recordings do not provide any benefit of translation or captioning; nonquadrilingual listeners must consult transcripts from other sites. But what is heard, even now, seems remarkable: a rough first draft of judgment, beginning just five months after the war with Germany ended and unfolding over nearly a year as its arbiters strained to fit minimal forms of existing law to maximal forms of moral degradation.</td>

Mr. Sepúlveda was charged with criminal obstruction of breathing, a misdemeanor, in connection with an altercation with his wife, police officials said.<br />According to the officials, authorities received a 911 call for a domestic incident involving Mr. Sepúlveda and his wife early on the morning of Jan. 9. Officers who responded to the Daly Avenue residence said both spouses accused each other of assault, police officials said.<br />Mr. Sepúlveda didn’t return a call or text message seeking comment. His attorney, Marvin Raskin, said that the senator was awaiting arraignment in the Bronx, and that the arrest arose from a false accusation that sought to build leverage in a continuing divorce proceeding.<br />Mr. Raskin said Mr. Sepúlveda was estranged from his wife and said his client was the victim of “recurring physical violence.” The couple have a young child, Mr. Raskin said.</td>

      <td>Netflix’s grim four-part docuseries highlights the forensic work of detectives Frank Salerno and Gil Carrillo, who ultimately identified the erratic killer.</td>
      <td>That television is acrawl with serial killers probably says something unpleasant about our shared capacity for morbid fascination. It might even represent an extreme version of the “there-but-for-the-grace-of-God” attraction of so much reality TV. But some cases can stand up to repeated revisiting, notably that of the so-called Night Stalker, which has now been the subject of at least half a dozen film and TV adaptations, one of which starred Richard Jordan and A Martinez as detectives Frank Salerno and Gil Carrillo.<br />The real-life Carrillo and Salerno are the stars, so to speak, of the four-part Netflix series “Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,” which director Tiller Russell adorns with an excess of boogeyman visuals and ominous music, but which provides a cop’s-eye view of why the case remains so interesting. “We’d never encountered someone like that,” says Mr. Salerno, alluding to the methodologies of Richard Ramirez, which were so varied and random they offered up no immediate connections between the crimes or any obvious profile of the killer himself. Ramirez, who died in prison in 2013, shot people in their sleep, sexually assaulted his victims, beat them viciously, dragged one out of her car in traffic and shot her; he abducted children, molested them but let them live (usually) while killing his adult targets; he mutilated, burglarized and his weapons ranged from guns and knives to hammers and tire irons. Police investigators such as Messrs. Salerno and Carrillo were accustomed to suspects who exhibited specific homicidal pathologies. Ramirez, who terrorized Los Angeles and San Francisco in 1984 and ’85, seemed to have them all.<br />The process by which the detectives finally linked up the various crimes is the narrative engine of “Night Stalker,” which provides quite a bit of background on the police officers, and some crazily moody portraiture, but also gives us a glimpse inside the investigative mind. Mr. Carrillo tells us that during the course of his academic study of criminal psychology he learned that there was a certain deviancy that thrived on the frightened look on a victim’s face—something that had been a distinctive aspect of several of the crimes. Mr. Salerno, who was instrumental in cracking the Hillside Strangler case of the ’70s and so had considerable experience with multiple murderers, recalls Ramirez committing one home invasion in which he stopped, mid-mayhem, to fix himself something to eat. “That’s a pretty sick individual,” Mr. Salerno says, not meaning to be funny.<br />The tracking of the killer’s footprints—left by what turned out to be a pair of very distinctive Avia sneakers—becomes an obsession, both for the detectives and for us. It was also the kind of detail they had to strive to keep out of the media, lest Ramirez, who obviously followed his own coverage and left very few clues behind, stop wearing the shoes. The police cut deals with the press and TV outlets to keep certain details from the public, but they couldn’t control politicians: When it became clear that Ramirez had relocated to San Francisco, then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein held a news conference in which she “vomited” details of the crimes that had been shared by the two cities. The resentment of the cops seems as fresh today as it must have been then.<br />So, yes, there’s a bit of payback at play in “Night Stalker,” especially regarding the Los Angeles Police Department. Detectives Carrillo and Salerno, who were with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, recall several instances where information wasn’t shared, or incompetence ruled the day. A car that probably contained Ramirez’s fingerprints was kept in an outdoor LAPD lot, undusted, until its usefulness as evidence was destroyed. A dentist’s office to which Ramirez was sure to return—he had an impacted tooth—was staked out by Sheriff’s officers, but they were replaced for budgetary reasons by an LAPD alarm. The dentist was to use it if and when Ramirez returned. Which he did. And the alarm malfunctioned. “So we missed him,” Mr. Carrillo says, generously.</td>

      <td>Kyra Sedgwick stars as an over-intrusive, overly forward mom in ABC’s new sitcom.</td>
      <td>From June Cleaver, Edith Bunker and Clair Huxtable to Morticia Addams, Peg Bundy and Marge Simpson, the TV mom as an institution has been a source of warmth, solace and neuroses. While the characters in question were usually busy being moms, there have been empty-nesters, too, and ones with no sense of boundaries: Endora (“Bewitched”) would arrive unannounced in a puff of smoke; Marie Barone (“Everybody Loves Raymond”) lived next door, though one could hardly ever tell.<br />In “Call Your Mother,” Kyra Sedgwick plays Jean Raines, intrusive mother extraordinaire: When she can’t get her son, Freddie (Joey Bragg), on the phone for four days she packs her bags and leaves for Los Angeles. Are her relocated children happy to see her? Is it sunny in L.A.? What’s clear, partly through Ms. Sedgwick’s portrayal—a mix of Midwest nice and East Coast anxious—is that Jean is as eager to leave Iowa as her kids were, especially after a decade or so as a single parent and nothing else to do.<br />Two things are immediately evident in the pilot for the show, which was created by Kari Lizer (“The New Adventures of Old Christine”). One, it’s a pandemic production: The airport where Jean says goodbye to her pal Sharon (Sherri Shepherd) is just a facade; every apartment in L.A. seems to be the same set, with the furniture moved around. It’s an underpopulated program, although there’s something heartening, too, about imagining everyone off camera in face masks, distancing and trying to get a show on the air. The other thing that seems apparent is how difficult it will be to sustain sufficient energy with mom in the center ring. All the mothers cited above were sidekicks, or part of an ensemble, but Ms. Sedgwick seems positioned to carry most of the burden, and other than Jean being meddlesome or looking for a sex life—or delivering mawkish soliloquies about the importance of family—there aren’t any obvious avenues to be followed. On the other hand, only the one episode was available for review, so they might fool us all. Let’s hope.<br />There is a potential love interest—Danny (Patrick Brammall) her “host,” in the Airbnb sense, who warns that his dog has a tendency to hump. “So do I,” Jean replies, and Danny, to his credit, looks taken aback. I have to admit I was startled, likewise, when Jean calls a belligerent driver at the airport a “dick.” Much worse can be heard almost everywhere on television, but on a network show? It’s still a little shocking. What would Carol Brady have thought?</td>

      <td>Regarding your editorial “Donald Trump’s Final Days” (Jan. 8): You write, “If Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign.” An impeachment could never be resolved at trial within the remainder of his presidency.<br />You continue, “This would be the cleanest solution since it would immediately turn presidential duties over to Mr. Pence. And it would give Mr. Trump agency, a la Richard Nixon, over his own fate.” Of what high crime or misdemeanor has my president been accused: Of inciting a riot? How exactly? Of somehow failing to speak some magic formula to the mainstream press within a few moments after being informed of a chaotic crisis (which you exaggerate as an “assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election”)? But he hasn’t been shown to have initiated, condoned or sanctioned anything more than a peaceful demonstration. Why then is he supposed to admit culpability in this affair and resign in disgrace?<br />Tactically, it might be beneficial for him to hand the presidency to Vice President Mike Pence and accept a full pardon, a la Nixon. But to do so would destroy a movement that he nurtured and which is far from moribund, for his own personal convenience. Time will vindicate Donald Trump, but this editorial won’t be forgotten in this household long after Mr. Trump leaves office.<br />David deForrest<br />Jacksonville, Fla.</td>

The shares will be sold by the company, and Zoom included the typical boiler plate explanation in its filing that the proceeds would be used for “working capital and general corporate purposes,” with the possibility that the money also could help fund acquisitions though no current deals are in the works.<br />Zoom’s videoconferencing business is still booming, in large part because of Covid-19, but investors are already grappling with what post-pandemic life could mean for the company. The once-highflying stock is now 40% off its mid-October peak. And while still richly valued at around 30 times forward sales, it is no longer the most premium play among cloud stocks. At least a dozen now carry higher multiples relative to projected sales.<br />But Zoom is still valued at close to $100 billion, a level that software companies don’t typically reach until they have established multiple lines of business. So the company still faces some pressure to show it is no one trick pony.<br />The company disclosed Tuesday that it has now sold 1 million seats for its Zoom Phone service, which replaces office telephone systems. That is a potentially huge market, but also one with very well-entrenched competitors along with newer challengers such as  Microsoft ,  Google and  RingCentral .</td>

After Israel released her in an extortionate prisoner exchange, Tamimi returned to her native Jordan, where she was welcomed as a hero. The U.S. subsequently unveiled federal charges, named her an FBI Most Wanted Terrorist and requested her extradition from Jordan pursuant to a 1995 treaty. Jordan refuses.<br />We stand emphatically with the Pearls and pray public outrage will cause Pakistan to reverse course, ensuring Pearl’s killer remains behind bars or is sent for trial in the U.S. Parents must be spared the agony of manifest injustice on top of heart-breaking personal loss.

So everything is now available to our states and our health-care providers,” he said.<br />The government had been allocating about half of newly available doses from  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna Inc.  to states since the vaccine rollout began last month.

Later, when the student did so, he said, another officer stopped him from speaking because of complaints over his remarks.<br />The student, Chike Uzuegbunam, sued the Lawrenceville, Ga., school for violating his First Amendment rights. College administrators reversed course, opening the entire campus to student speech with minimal restrictions, and a federal judge dismissed the case as moot. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, upheld that decision.<br />That left Mr. Uzuegbunam, who since has graduated, without a dollar in compensation from the college—and, a dollar, what courts call nominal compensation, is what he was seeking. More significantly, it frustrated the advocacy group representing him, Alliance Defending Freedom, from collecting attorneys’ fees and costs from the school.<br />In that the policy had been rescinded and Mr. Uzuegbunam obtained his degree, several justices questioned whether there were any grounds for damages.</td>

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit said in a 2-1 ruling that only federal lawmakers can make such a site legal.<br />“Its motives are admirable,” Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote for the majority, regarding Safehouse. “But Congress has made it a crime to open a property to others to use drugs.”<br />Safehouse aims to open a site that would offer broad support for drug users, including a room where they can take drugs with supervision so that someone can quickly intervene and treat an overdose. Supporters say the concept, already used in places like Europe and Canada but novel in the U.S., will save lives and help people get access to treatment.<br />Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia sued two years ago, arguing Safehouse would violate part of a 1986 antidrug law that makes it illegal to knowingly host illicit drug use and other drug-related activity. Safehouse won a favorable lower-court ruling in late 2019, but the appeals-court panel’s majority sided with local U.S. Attorney William McSwain’s interpretation of the law.</td>

      <td>Yield on 10-year Treasury note still on course to rise for seventh consecutive trading session</td>
      <td>U.S. government-bond yields pared an early climb Tuesday after a Treasury Department auction of new 10-year notes met strong demand from investors.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note closed at 1.136% according to Tradeweb, down from above 1.18% before the sale. That is barely changed from 1.131% Monday.<br />Yields, which fall as bond prices rise, declined after asset managers and other buyers scooped up the majority of $38 billion worth of new government debt, leaving bond dealers with around 20% of the securities. Treasury prices often fall when dealers win larger shares at the auctions, a sign of weak demand from investors.<br />The 10-year yield, a key barometer for borrowing costs throughout the economy, still headed for a seventh consecutive daily gain, extending a march above 1% that began after Democrats won control of the Senate. The prospects for greater government spending, along with economic growth and inflation, helped push the yield out of its relatively narrow, post-pandemic range near all-time lows.<br />Asset managers were keenly watching the results of Tuesday’s auction to gauge whether the recent bond selloff would continue or whether yields will settle in a new range. Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said it marked “something of an inflection point for rates,” in a note to clients.</td>

Data won’t initially be made public for individual hospitals, according to senior HHS officials. HHS expects to make the data public after verifying its quality, they said.<br />Hospital workers were among the first to be immunized from the limited early U.S. supply of vaccines because of their exposure to the virus and critical work. But the national rollout of vaccines has been slow and rocky. Hospitals largely haven’t mandated workers get the vaccine. Surveys show not all personnel are willing to be immunized.<br />Vaccinations through the end of last year reached about 2.8 million administered doses, far less than the federal goal of 20 million.<br />The Trump administration said Tuesday it would release additional vaccine supplies, and called for immunization of adults older than 65 and those with health issues that put them at risk.

      <td>More than 9,000 infants died in homes for unmarried mothers in Ireland between the 1920s and the 1990s, many run by Catholic religious orders, a long-awaited inquiry concluded after years of campaigning from survivors and their offspring.<br />In some years during the 1930s and 1940s, the report said, more than 40% of the children in the mother-and-baby homes were dying before their first birthday, high mortality rates often known to the government and local authorities.<br />Over the entire period of the study, about 15% of all the children who were in the 18 institutions that were investigated died in the homes, some of which were owned and run by local health authorities and others by religious orders.<br />Ireland’s Prime Minister Micheál Martin said the report described a “dark, difficult and shameful chapter of very recent Irish history” that had lasting consequences. He said the Church, state and society shared responsibility and that religious orders responsible should make a contribution to those seeking redress.<br />Some of the religious orders responsible for the homes issued apologies. The former Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, said “the church way outstepped its role and became a controlling church,” and should apologize, in comments to RTÉ, the Irish broadcaster. He said those responsible for the abuse betrayed vulnerable women and their calling.</td>

If Mr. Pence doesn’t act, Democrats have said they would move forward with an impeachment vote Wednesday, and would have enough votes even without GOP support.<br />Mr. Trump, in his first comments to reporters in several days, criticized Democrats for seeking to impeach him, calling it a “continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics” and said the move was “causing tremendous anger.”<br />He also called for “no violence,” as concerns mount about the possibility of more violent protests around Inauguration Day.<br />The president defended himself against criticism that his efforts to rile up his supporters about baseless claims of election fraud led to last week’s riot. “They’ve analyzed my speech…my final paragraph, my final sentence, and everybody just thought it was totally appropriate,” he said.</td>

      <td>Elite auction houses like Sotheby’s are betting on rare sneakers and sought-after streetwear. Here, what’s earned the highest hammer prices and how to spot items that could someday be worth a bundle.</td>
      <td>On Trend is a weekly column on men’s style that explores fashion’s subcultures and of-the-moment curiosities.<br />IN LATE December 2020, the venerated auction house Sotheby’s hosted an online-only sale of a pair of leather Adidas sneakers. Made in partnership with the 311-year-old porcelain-maker Meissen specifically for the auction, the shoes had been festooned with porcelain overlays and meticulously hand-painted with fanciful motifs from toe to heel, a six-month process that elevated humble sweat repositories to something approaching art. To the highest bidder, the sneakers were worth $126,000. (All proceeds went to the Brooklyn Museum.)<br />These extravagant Adidas shoes are among the sneakers and high-end streetwear pieces that have been infiltrating the tony auction market of late. In July 2019, Sotheby’s sold a historic set of  Nike ’s  “Moon Shoe” waffle-soled sneakers from 1972 for a then-record-setting $437,500. A pair of game-worn Michael Jordan sneakers has since sold for more.<br />Much of the streetwear now on the auction block was sold via traditional retail shops just a few years earlier—with their auction-hammer prices dwarfing their original prices. Last September, a 2017 Supreme hoodie made in partnership with Louis Vuitton sold at Sotheby’s in New York for $6,048, far more than the $935 it commanded at retail. In October at Bonhams in London, a pair of 2018 Nike x Off-White Jordan 1 sneakers fetched around $2,750, an increase of 1,347% over their $190 retail price. And in November 2019, a Supreme-branded Rimowa suitcase earned roughly $6,400 at Christie’s in Hong Kong. The suitcase had hit the retail market in 2018 at $1,800.<br />Treating sneakers as re-sellable assets is hardly a new concept. In the early 2000s Jordan Geller, the founder of sneaker museum Shoezeum, began buying sneakers at California swap meets to resell for profit on  eBay .  Internet flippers like him built out a big-money market for theretofore overlooked Nikes and Adidas as well as limited-run Supreme gear. Eventually, Mr. Geller amassed a mammoth personal collection of sneakers, including the Nike Moon Shoes that he would later sell through Sotheby’s for as much as a Picasso sketch.</td>

      <td>To conquer the clutter in our homes we must also be ready to deal with the many emotions buried in it, says Jes Marcy, a professional organizer in Poestenkill, N.Y. Ms. Marcy leads online classes on how to get rid of unnecessary items and on social media runs a private support group for people trying to organize their homes, a process that can be fraught with stress, guilt, resentment and grief, she says.<br />Ms. Marcy tells clients that when they start to unclutter their homes of physical possessions they inevitably will find connections to emotional, financial and relationship issues in their lives, too. “It’s all clutter and it’s all connected,” she says.<br />Ms. Marcy discussed how to navigate decluttering landmines, why you shouldn’t buy anything to get organized and how to deal with boxes of items that could draw tears. Edited excerpts:<br />How has the pandemic affected people’s relationship with clutter?<br />For some people it has sparked this idea that we need to stockpile. Others say “I’m going to lose my mind if I have to look at this stuff any longer.” There comes a point where stockpiling is more hazardous than not stockpiling. Physical hazards exist with clutter because you can trip, it creates dust and mold and it can be a fire hazard. Anybody who has lived through a natural disaster or any sort of emergency will             attest that skills are more important than stockpiles. We’re also realizing the importance of having functional space. We don’t tend to look at our space, except maybe our kitchen counters, as functional space. For years we’ve been converting space in our house to storage. Then we take away that ability to add a desk when we need to, for example.</td>

They use improved treatments for Covid-19 that are keeping more people alive.<br />Meantime, they have continued with elective surgeries so that people with serious conditions such as cancer receive procedures. That also means more hospital beds are occupied.<br />The downside: hospitals are even fuller and under more pressure than they were last spring.</td>

      <td>Twenty sixteen seems like a lifetime ago, but it’s been fewer than five years since conservatives like me were struggling to accept Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for president. Mr. Trump was a thrice-married New York casino magnate, who had given thousands of dollars to liberal politicians including Chuck Schumer and Kamala Harris. Now he was poised to lead the Party of Reagan?<br />I had my own personal confrontations with Mr. Trump. In 2011 he called me a “loser.” I immediately phoned to remind the not-always successful developer that not winning at everything doesn’t make you a loser—that learning from your defeats makes you a winner. He told me I was “too conservative” and “too pro-life.” A few months later he endorsed Mitt Romney.<br />So when he was about to secure the 2016 nomination, conservatives like me needed reassurance that he would follow through on the campaign promises he was making. Much of that reassurance came in the form of Mike Pence.<br />I have known Mr. Pence for 20 years. He is a trusted conservative and, more important, a good man. He served in the House while I was in the Senate. In 2010, when we were both considering 2012 presidential runs, Mike and I had several conversations about our visions, the issues that were driving us to run, and the family considerations we were struggling with. Not until he decided to run for governor of Indiana did I feel compelled to seek the presidency.<br />We have seen the vice president’s hand in much of Mr. Trump’s accomplishments over the past four years. We saw the man who called me “too pro-life” become the most pro-life president, the first to address the March for Life. We saw it in the nomination of committed constitutionalists like Justice Amy Coney Barrett. And we saw it in the regulatory reforms the administration has made to improve the economic climate.</td>

      <td>The fight over who gets the shot first is slowing the rollout. Date of birth is the best proxy for level of risk.</td>
      <td>The distribution of Covid vaccines is proceeding slowly even as a new, faster-moving viral variant arrives from London. The number of vaccinations administered last month was less than 25% of the original projections, while Covid hospitalizations and deaths reached new highs across the country. Perhaps inoculations will pick up in the coming weeks, but this has been what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls “Phase A,” when the serum is reserved for two highly accessible, readily identifiable groups: health-care workers and nursing-home residents.<br />“Phase B” could be much worse. It is true that the CDC finally said on Tuesday that it would release doses initially held back for second injections and that the shots should be available to anyone over 65 and those with pre-existing conditions. But states still have wide latitude to set priorities. Many are still deliberating, and some have turned the question over to officials at the county or even hospital level. Other states are sorting the elderly between those who have two or more comorbidities and those who don’t.<br />In many states, essential workers have been assigned priority. They are spreaders, it is said. They encounter the public when policing the streets, stocking shelves at grocery stores, or teaching in schools. The definition of essential worker has at times expanded to include Uber drivers, meatpackers and all those in the retail and manufacturing industries. The head of the Texas Restaurant Association says prioritization should go to those helping to “feed Texans.”<br />Each addition and distinction may seem reasonable, but the cost in delay and confusion is high. Covid vaccinations are proving more complicated than the flu shot. Out of an abundance of caution, some hospitals are requiring recipients to be tested for Covid first, and then wait 15 minutes after the vaccination to check for an allergic reaction. Applying the Phase B regulations will add to these delays. How does a person prove employment or a health condition? Must pharmacies turn away applicants who lack supporting documentation? With all these delays, summer could come and go before Phase B ends and the general public can finally be vaccinated.<br />It is time for simplification. To deliver free vaccines with maximum speed, the health-care system needs to follow a simple rule that applies to everyone. Fortunately, such a rule is readily available: date of birth. The older the person, the higher the priority. One can prove one’s age simply by showing a driver’s license, Medicare or Medicaid card, or another form of identification. For most, that information is already embedded in the files of hospitals, pharmacies and doctors’ offices.</td>

That exceeded the growth rate of  Kroger  and  Walmart  for the comparable period and was roughly 2 percentage points better than the broad industry, according to Evercore ISI.<br />Net income for the quarter came in almost 40% below Wall Street estimates, though that number looks much worse due to a charge to withdraw from a union pension fund. Excluding that impact, net income blew past expectations.<br />The grocery chain’s traditional focus on fresh products is continuing to pay off, with sales growth in that category higher than the total. That turns out to be an important advantage. As consumers across the board are making fewer shopping trips, those that pick up fresh produce tend to drop by stores more frequently, Albertsons noted in its Tuesday morning earnings call.<br />In other areas, Albertsons is still playing catch up. Digital sales continued to impress, growing 225% from a year earlier. It was the third consecutive quarter in which digital sales increased by more than 200%, though the caveat is that Albertsons’ started out with a smaller e-commerce base than some of its competitors.</td>

The order is expected to go into effect Jan. 26, according to a person familiar with the matter. The CDC and other administration officials were still completing the order.<br />The CDC order for universal testing of passengers, including for U.S. citizens returning from abroad, comes weeks after the Trump administration imposed a testing requirement for travelers from the U.K. over concerns about a more infectious strain of the virus that was detected there. Since then, the new strain has been found elsewhere in the world, and its presence in the U.S. has been confirmed.<br />The U.S. requirement comes during a difficult time for the aviation industry and international travelers who face a thicket of varied testing protocols and quarantine requirements around the world, including public-health advisories urging people to stay home.<br />U.S. airlines have voiced support for the new requirement but argued that ramped-up testing protocols should take the place of travel restrictions and quarantines to reduce the spread of Covid-19.</td>

      <td>SolarWinds Corp.  said a computer breach tied to Russia-linked hackers who accessed U.S. government systems and corporate networks after manipulating some of the software provider’s code began at least a month earlier than first disclosed.<br />Hackers were accessing its systems in early September 2019, the network-management company said Tuesday, based on a continuing investigation. Cybersecurity experts suspect preparations for the attack go back far longer. A month later, a version of the company’s Orion Platform software appears to have contained modifications designed to test the hackers ability to insert malicious code into the system. The code was added starting Feb. 20, 2020, SolarWinds said, and the compromised software was available to its customers by March 26, 2020.<br />Intelligence officials have said the attack was one of the most sophisticated cyber intrusions of U.S. systems they had seen.<br />SolarWinds, working with hired cybersecurity experts, said it reverse-engineered the malicious code, called Sunburst, allowing them to learn more about the hack. The Austin, Texas-based company said an analysis suggests that hackers circumvented detection by mimicking legitimate network traffic that was run through U.S. servers. It is still trying to establish how the code entered its software and went undetected, the company said.<br />The investigation showed that the hackers removed the code from the system in June. SolarWinds said it learned of the breach on Dec. 12.</td>

Many consumers are shopping for groceries less frequently, buying greater amounts of food when they do and at times splurging on premium food products.<br />“We continue to see fewer trips per household but larger baskets,” Albertsons Chief Executive Vivek Sankaran said Tuesday on a call with analysts.<br />Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons said sales at stores open at least 15 months, excluding fuel, rose 12.3% for the quarter ended Dec. 5. The sales growth reflected a slight decline from the prior quarter, when the company posted a 13.8% increase, but it beat expectations and was higher than sales growth at other grocers such as  Kroger Co.  and  Walmart Inc.<br />“We are encouraged that customers spending more time at home are looking to us,” Mr. Sankaran said.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden’s trade policy will focus on helping American workers by ensuring trade agreements protect and enhance U.S. jobs—and not just ensure low prices of imported goods for consumers, his nominee for the top trade-policy job said Tuesday.<br />Katherine Tai, in her first speech since Mr. Biden nominated her for U.S. Trade Representative, said the new administration’s policy priorities also include confronting China over its trade practices and enforcing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed by President Trump last year with bipartisan support.<br />“The president-elect’s vision is to implement a worker-centered trade policy,” Ms. Tai said in a video-streamed speech to the National Foreign Trade Council, a business-advocacy group. “What it means in practice is that U.S. trade policy must benefit regular Americans, communities and workers. And that starts with recognizing that people are not just consumers. They are also workers and wage earners.”<br />The emphasis on protecting U.S. jobs was a guiding principle of the Trump administration’s trade policy, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Monday, in which he credited Ms. Tai for helping win Democratic support for the USMCA, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement.<br />Ms. Tai has spent much of her career in the government, first as a lawyer for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, then as a congressional staff member. Most recently, she was chief trade counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee.</td>

      <td>Brian Ratner struggled over whether to send his two children to overnight camp last summer. Even though Camp Robin Hood, located in Freedom, N.H., had a solid plan to create a safety bubble, Mr. Ratner knew there was a risk of a Covid outbreak.<br />After three rounds of testing, including one before camp, and strict enforcement of mask-wearing, director Richard Woodstein called everyone together, turned up the music and announced the good news: Everyone tested negative. Campers ripped off their masks, hugged each other and danced.<br />Mr. Ratner soon received a letter from his 11-year-old daughter Lila. That moment was one of the greatest days of her life, she wrote. “Right now I don’t feel like corona is a thing and I am so happy.”<br />Lila and her 13-year-old brother, Noah, who haven’t been to school in person since last March, are already signed up for summer 2021. “I feel much more confident than last year. I know what to expect,” says Mr. Ratner, an attorney in Potomac, Md.<br />Overnight camp has always been a way to give children an experience removed from the realities of everyday life—a place to run free, learn new things and make lifelong friendships. Rarely have such joys been as amplified as during the Covid-19 pandemic, as many students have felt isolated most of the year, spending their time in front of computers and away from peers, unable to participate in sports, music or drama.</td>

Vigtory will also be available to those outside of the FuboTV subscriber base. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.<br />FuboTV launched about six years ago as a way for Americans to stream foreign soccer games, only to become a fully fledged alternative to the traditional cable-TV package. It competes with other over-the-internet bundles, including  Alphabet Inc.’s  YouTube TV,  Walt Disney Co. ’s Hulu + Live TV and  AT&T Inc.’s  AT&T TV Now. The company does have a broader emphasis on foreign sports—particularly soccer—than most of its competitors.<br />Many media companies have been teaming up with online sportsbooks, which are operated by digital companies such as  DraftKings Inc.  and FanDuel Group and bricks-and-mortar casino operators. Sportsbooks are growing in popularity as sports wagering expands across the U.S., a practice that has so far been legalized in 25 states and the District of Columbia. The U.S. sports-betting market is projected to reach about $13.5 billion by 2025, based on 38 states legalizing sports wagering by then, according to an estimate from  MGM Resorts International .<br />Last fall ESPN reached a deal with DraftKings and  Caesars Entertainment Inc.  to connect its audience to the gambling operators’ sportsbooks across digital platforms.

The protesters say they are worried the laws dismantle a government safety net that attempts to guarantee that even small farmers will have a place to sell their produce at a fair price. New Delhi says the rules are aimed at deregulating and modernizing the agricultural markets.<br />The Supreme Court, by ordering for a committee to be formed, has effectively backed an approach that the government has repeatedly offered to farmers as a way out of the impasse. Farm leaders and government officials have already met several times without success.<br />“While we may not stifle a peaceful protest, we think that the extraordinary order of stay of implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest, at least for the present and will encourage the farmers bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihoods,” the court order said.</td>

Buyers pay most of the purchase price on delivery, so Boeing has been short of cash, forcing it to raise debt and cut costs.<br />Both plane makers have been dented by the pandemic-driven slump in air travel. With vaccines raising hopes for a recovery, Airbus said it is preparing to increase production after slowing output last year.<br />Boeing, in contrast, has become more reliant on sales of cargo and military jets to ease the strain on its finances caused by the prolonged grounding of the 737 MAX and manufacturing problems that have halted deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner.<br />The plane maker handed over 157 jets last year, including cargo and military planes, trailing the 566 deliveries at Airbus.</td>

On Tuesday, the government also blocked all social-media channels.<br />The contest embodies a generational clash across Africa, where entrenched older leaders are grappling with increasingly restless youthful populations demanding improved economic opportunities. Mr. Museveni disparagingly calls Mr. Wine, “my grandson” while the rapper taunts the president as “an aging dictator,” who should leave power to avoid the fate of Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe or Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi.<br />“I am the representative of the future,” Mr. Wine said. “The struggle is Africa’s generational cause and we shouldn’t retreat.”</td>

The son of an immigrant Jewish cabdriver, he flitted from one business to another, dabbling in mortgage brokerage, investment advice, venture capital, real estate, chartered tours and sales of De-Ice-It spray for windshields.<br />In his mid-30s, Mr. Adelson began finding his way as an entrepreneur who would become one of the world’s richest men, with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $35.9 billion. He made himself into a giant in the casino industry with his lucrative resorts, one of the largest donors to the Republican Party, a leading backer of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a newspaper publisher in Nevada and Israel.<br />Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced the death of its chairman and chief executive in a statement Tuesday, less than a week after the company said he was taking a medical leave for cancer treatment. In March 2019, the company said Mr. Adelson had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.<br />His unlikely rise from obscurity began when he launched a trade publication for data-communications firms in the 1970s. Mr. Adelson noticed that other publishers sponsored trade shows. So, in 1979, near the beginning of the personal-computer boom, he launched Computer Dealers Exposition, or Comdex, which became a hugely successful trade exhibit held in Las Vegas and other cities. In 1988, needing space for his own exhibition center in Las Vegas to accommodate growing crowds, he bought the Sands hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip for $110 million, opening up a new line of business.</td>

      <td>If golf courses and resorts struggle to attract and keep members, it would weigh on the overall Trump Organization</td>
      <td>The storming of the Capitol last week by a pro-Trump mob will ratchet up the pressure on President Trump’s family business at a moment when some of his most lucrative assets were already suffering from the pandemic and facing looming debt payments.<br />One of the Trump Organization’s most loyal partners, German lender  Deutsche Bank AG , is moving to distance itself from the president’s businesses and is unlikely to lend it more money, says a person familiar with the matter. The bank has lent the Trump Organization more than $300 million that will mature in 2023 and 2024, forcing the company to refinance the debt or pay it off by potentially selling assets.<br />The other risk to the Trump Organization is that some customers stop patronizing its businesses, in particular its hotels and golf courses. The company has tried to sell its Washington, D.C., hotel, but the pandemic made buyers wary. The hotel was popular with supporters of Mr. Trump and with organizations trying to seek favor from the president. Business had already been expected to decline there once Mr. Trump leaves office.<br />The Trump Organization’s golf courses and resorts are particularly important, accounting for nearly half of the company’s annual revenue. The courses are closely associated with the president and have used his name to attract customers in a weak market for golf. If the courses struggle to attract and keep members, it would weigh on the Trump Organization overall.<br />On Sunday, PGA of America said it was terminating an agreement to hold the 2022 PGA Championship at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey, citing risk to its brand of being affiliated with Mr. Trump. The Trump Organization said that the PGA’s decision was a “breach of a binding contract.”</td>

      <td>Lawyers face ethical complaints, lawsuits and professional reproach that could take years to resolve</td>
      <td>Lawyers who argued unproven election-fraud claims for President Trump face mounting ethical complaints, legal threats and professional rebukes that could follow them long after Mr. Trump’s presidency ends next week.<br />The pushback has been particularly robust in Michigan, one of several battleground states where the Trump campaign and Republican allies filed lawsuits claiming fraud and misconduct in the November election. Former Attorney General William Barr and other federal law-enforcement officials have said there was no evidence of fraud in Michigan or elsewhere sufficient to overturn Mr. Trump’s loss to President-elect Joe Biden.<br />Lawyers for the city of Detroit last week asked a federal judge in Michigan’s Eastern District to reprimand the lawyers who brought one of the lawsuits alleging fraud—including Sidney Powell and L. Lin Wood, who worked with the Trump campaign—and to refer them for disbarment and impose financial penalties.<br />“The extent of the factual and legal errors in this complaint would warrant sanctions under any circumstances, but here the court’s processes are being perverted to undermine our democracy and to upset the peaceful transfer of power,” Detroit’s lawyer, David Fink, wrote to U.S. District Judge Linda V. Parker.<br />The lawsuit was filed on behalf of several Michigan voters, claiming that Michigan election officials used election software designed by foreign dictators to manipulate the vote, along with other unproven illegal conduct at the polls.</td>

      <td>Police in South Korea are scouring the country for leads in the disappearance of millions of dollars in cash from a casino on a popular holiday island.<br />Jeju Shinhwa World, one of the largest resorts on Jeju Island, reported to police earlier this month that over 14 billion won, equivalent to $13 million, had gone missing from the Landing Casino, where gamblers typically play baccarat and other high-stakes card games.<br />Hong Kong-based casino operator  Landing International Development Ltd.  has asked police to look for a female employee from Malaysia who had been in charge of the cash but hadn’t returned to work after leaving for a vacation at the end of December. In a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange, executive director Wong Hoi Po said Landing hadn’t been able to reach the woman.<br />Shares in Landing International Development fell 7.6% to hit a record low on Monday, before recovering 4.7% on Tuesday.<br />South Korea’s semiofficial Yonhap News Agency reported that police in Jeju have retrieved security camera footage from the casino, but found that footage taken at around the time of the suspected heist had been erased.</td>

      <td>Some publicly traded real-estate companies have found a buyer for their shares, despite empty offices, deserted hotels and reeling shopping malls—the companies themselves.<br />Real-estate owners, including  SL Green Realty Corp.  and  Healthcare Trust of America Inc.,  say stock-market investors have significantly undervalued their property holdings compared with what they could fetch in the private market. While some of these companies authorized buying back their own shares even before the coronavirus pandemic, they are betting that with a vaccine rollout under way, travel, office work and mall shopping will bounce back after a terrible year for major property types.<br />Brookfield Asset Management Inc.  took this strategy one step further last week, when it offered to buy the nearly 40% stake in  Brookfield Property Partners  LP it doesn’t already own for $5.9 billion. Brookfield Property, which BAM spun off about eight years ago, is one of the world’s largest real-estate investors and owns the giant office and retail complexes Brookfield Place in New York and London’s Canary Wharf.<br />The stock market “doesn’t properly value or appreciate the quality of the assets that we own,” Brian Kingston, managing partner of BAM’s real-estate group, said last week.<br />Shares of public mall and office companies last week were trading at average discounts of 20% and 32%, respectively, to the net asset value of their underlying property, according to real-estate analytics firm Green Street.</td>

      <td>Ride-sharing companies seek early access to doses for workers, offer to take passengers to get their shots</td>
      <td>Ride-sharing giants  Lyft Inc.  and  Uber Technologies Inc.  are lobbying the incoming Biden administration for a role in the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, offering to help get more Americans inoculated while seeking early access to doses for drivers.<br />Lyft executives met with President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team in December, making the case for the incoming administration to allocate federal funds for vaccine-related transportation, said Megan Callahan, who leads Lyft’s health-care business, a large provider of nonemergency medical transportation. Lyft officials shared their analysis of public data with the Biden team on the millions of at-risk people who lack health-care transportation benefits or have limited public transportation due to coronavirus, she said.<br />Separately, Uber said Tuesday it is joining with vaccine maker  Moderna Inc.  to provide users with vaccine-safety information via the ride-sharing app. The companies said they aim to work with public-health agencies to help those eligible for doses to schedule rides and receive reminder notifications.<br />The pandemic has weighed on ride-sharing companies as the spreading virus shut down restaurants and curbed social gatherings and travel. Ferrying people to vaccine sites could boost their business in the near term and may help kick-start a rollout that has gone more slowly than federal officials planned.<br />Both major ride-sharing companies have talked to public-health officials across the country about helping with appointment transport, according to people familiar with those discussions, and have publicly offered millions of free rides to and from vaccine-administration sites. Ms. Callahan said state and municipal officials from heavily populated areas have been asking Lyft for free rides “because they do not have the funds.”</td>

      <td>U.S. crude futures recently rose above $50 per barrel for the first time since last February</td>
      <td>Oil is extending a steady recovery into 2021, aided by fresh signals that the world’s biggest producers won’t turn on the spigots and flood the market.<br />U.S. crude futures recently rose above $50 a barrel for the first time since last February, the latest milestone in a rebound powered by an uptick in travel and economic activity following the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Output cuts by large suppliers from Saudi Arabia to U.S. companies are turbocharging the advance, giving traders confidence that demand will exceed supply.<br />Prices have hit new peaks since Saudi Arabia said last week it would unilaterally cut output in February as part of an agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies like Russia. The supply curbs instilled faith that the cartel will remain flexible with output even if the pandemic worsens and hurts demand.<br />U.S. shale producers are also indicating that they are in no rush to increase supply and instead plan to pay off debt and return cash to shareholders. Taken together, the commitments should help the energy industry’s recovery and highlight a recognition among producers that the economic toll caused by the pandemic is far from over, investors and industry executives say. That means there is no need for suppliers to spend on additional output.<br />“I don’t think the world really needs the oil at this point in time, so there’s not a big reason to grow,” said Richard Dealy, president and chief operating officer of Texas oil company Pioneer Natural Resources Co. Despite the recent rise in oil prices, Pioneer still plans to cap oil-production growth at zero to 5% in 2021.</td>
