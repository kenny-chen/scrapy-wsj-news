      <td>PHOENIX—Pennsylvania GOP lawmakers visited an ongoing Republican-ordered audit of 2020 ballots here Wednesday and called for their state to conduct a similar review, the latest sign that political fighting over last year’s election is far from over.<br />Republicans in Arizona’s senate ordered the audit of roughly 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, that began in April. President Biden won Arizona by just over 10,000 votes out of more than 3.3 million cast statewide, in part due to a roughly two-percentage-point victory in Maricopa.<br />On Wednesday, three Republican state lawmakers from Pennsylvania toured the audit site, at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix, and met with several Arizona GOP lawmakers to discuss election issues, according to Arizona Republican state Sen. Wendy Rogers, who tweeted about the visit.<br />Pennsylvania Republican Cris Dush, a freshman senator from the north central part of the state, said he would like to see his state undertake a similar audit of 2020 ballots, which supporters say is meant to provide transparency. “Forty-seven percent of the people in this country don’t have faith in the electoral—electoral integrity right now,” Mr. Dush said in an interview. “And my constituents are very much up in arms, with the lack of any movement on trying to find out what happened.”<br />Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a Republican, also called for Pennsylvania to conduct an audit, which he said could potentially focus on one county that leaned Republican and another that leaned Democratic. Mr. Biden won the state last year. “I’m not about overturning anything,” he said. “I’m just trying to find out what went right, what went wrong? And how do we have better elections in the future?”</td>

JBS said it restarted most of its plants on Wednesday, and that it anticipated operating at close to full capacity Thursday. White House officials said the hacking was likely carried out by a group based in Russia, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation attributed the attack to REvil, a criminal ransomware gang.<br />On Wednesday, a ransomware attack disrupted ferry services in Massachusetts. New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority also revealed Wednesday that it had been hacked in April, although the attack didn’t disrupt operations, including the city’s subway system.<br />In May, the operator of an essential pipeline bringing gasoline to parts of the East Coast paid about $4.4 million to regain control of its operations and restore service.<br />San Diego-based Scripps Health said Tuesday that it is still recovering from a cyberattack it discovered on May 1 that disrupted its patient portal, electronic medical records, radiology and other systems and canceled or delayed appointments at its hospitals and clinics.</td>

Israel is opening up again, after several lockdowns last year and one of the world’s fastest Covid-19 inoculation campaigns.<br />The Biden administration is likely to see opportunity in a new leader amid lingering strains between Israel and many senior U.S. officials dating back to Mr. Netanyahu’s 2015 public campaign against the Iran nuclear deal. But the new government is also opposed to the Iran deal and isn’t expected to attempt any efforts toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</td>

      <td>DUBAI—The Persian Gulf island nation of Bahrain, battling a sharp resurgence of Covid-19 despite high levels of inoculation with a Chinese-made vaccine, has started giving booster shots to vulnerable citizens using a different vaccine made by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech  SE, a senior official said.<br />Waleed Khalifa al Manea, Bahrain’s undersecretary of health, said the vaccine manufactured by state-owned Chinese drugmaker Sinopharm, which has accounted for more than 60% of Bahrain’s inoculations so far, was providing a high degree of protection. More than 90% of people hospitalized in the current Covid-19 wave, the worst the country has faced, hadn’t been vaccinated, he said.<br />Still, Dr. al Manea added, Bahrain residents who are over 50, are obese or have chronic illnesses now are being urged to get another shot six months after their full Sinopharm vaccination—with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The government started offering the boosters at the end of May, he said.<br />Bahrain, which has made the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine available to unvaccinated residents for months, will continue to offer the choice of Sinopharm to those who prefer the Chinese vaccine, Dr. al Manea said. The government’s BeAware app allows users to book a Sinopharm booster shot, but says that Pfizer-BioNTech is recommended for more-vulnerable population groups.<br />Sinopharm and other Chinese vaccines have become key tools of Beijing’s international diplomacy, especially in developing nations unable to secure sufficient doses of U.S. and European-made shots. Sinopharm and another shot, manufactured by Sinovac Biotech Ltd., have already received emergency approval from the World Health Organization.</td>

      <td>An activist investor is likely to pick up a third seat on the board of  Exxon  Mobil Corp., giving it additional leverage to press the oil giant to address investor concerns about climate change.<br />Exxon said Wednesday that an updated vote count showed shareholders backed a third nominee of Engine No. 1, an upstart hedge fund that had already won two board seats at Exxon’s annual shareholder meeting last week. The final vote hasn’t been certified, Exxon said, and could take days or weeks to be finalized, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />“We look forward to working with all of our directors to build on the progress we’ve made to grow long-term shareholder value and succeed in a lower-carbon future,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a statement. “We thank all shareholders for their engagement and participation, and their ongoing support for our company.”<br />Engine No. 1, which owns a tiny fraction of Exxon’s stock, had sought four seats on the board and argued the Texas oil giant should commit to carbon neutrality, effectively bringing its emissions to zero—both from the company and its products—by 2050, as some peers have. If the preliminary voting results hold, it will control a quarter of Exxon’s 12-person board.<br />Last week, Mr. Woods was re-elected to the board along with seven of Exxon’s candidates, while the vote was too close to call for five nominees seeking the two remaining seats.</td>

      <td>One key to staying afloat during a crisis: plan ahead</td>
      <td>The pandemic has hit small businesses hard, with millions failing and countless others teetering on the edge of collapse.<br />The survivors have learned hard lessons about keeping a company afloat through a crisis. Here’s a look at some advice that experts and entrepreneurs have taken away from the pandemic.<br />Although we are still emerging from a crisis, use the time to prepare for the next one. Understand your existing hardware systems, your work flow and your employee structure. Discover where you have gaps and then build in redundancies to address them.<br />“Look at all of the roles and tasks in your organization holistically. Create a chart of deliverables—everything that needs to get done to conduct your business and who does it,” says David Weiman, who heads executive coaching and leadership firm Weiman Consulting in Wynnewood, Pa. “It provides a transparent structure showing who does what job—and, more importantly, who can step in and overlap when a crisis happens again.”<br />What’s more, an assessment “exposes the people who didn’t pull their weight and weren’t invested in the mission,” says Dr. Weiman. Some workers rose to the occasion in the pandemic—they helped others transition to working remotely, they were a backstop when smaller tasks or details were overshadowed by the bigger crisis, and they were an anchor for others as things fell apart around them. “It makes it easier to see and make decisions about existing personnel and new hires going forward,” Dr. Weiman says.</td>

      <td>The U.S. economy continued to pick up speed in the spring, as consumers, many of them newly vaccinated and flush with federal stimulus cash, returned to restaurants, hotels and retail stores, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.<br />But businesses told the Fed that ongoing supply-chain disruptions and an acute labor shortage have made it difficult for them to meet demand and have caused them to raise prices.<br />The Fed report, a collection of business anecdotes from around the county known as the Beige Book, said the economy grew at a moderate pace between early April and late May, “a somewhat faster rate than the prior reporting period.”<br />Manufacturers and home builders reported that materials and workers were in short supply. Companies also struggled with delivery delays, the report said. Car dealerships said sales were strong but inventories tight, partly due to the global chip shortage. Transportation companies said they saw exceptionally strong demand.<br />Prices rose more rapidly than earlier in the year, the Fed said, as businesses passed on rising material and freight prices to consumers.</td>

      <td>Can a bedroom’s interior design be expressive and colorful but still soothing enough to ease you to sleep? Yes, and here’s how.</td>
      <td>FIND THAT ONE thing that can serve as the inspiration for the color palette,” said Caitlin Murray, founder of Los Angeles’s Black Lacquer Design, when asked how to tackle a room’s décor. “It’s such an easy cheat.” In the case of a blandly modernized room in West Hollywood, the interior designer used an abstract painting as her jumping-off point. Guided by its mix of neutrals and pastels, she set about giving the bedroom enough character “for a lovely, spirited lady of a client” without over-energizing a space meant to be serene.<br />Ms. Murray gave the artwork’s soft pinks and blues their boldest expression in the blush velvet-upholstered bed and the blocky dresser, from CFC furniture, whose color, though technically Slate, reads dusty indigo.<br />Elsewhere, Ms. Murray deployed pattern in interesting ways. Pronouncing all-white ceilings and walls “so ‘Trading Spaces’ circa early 2000s,” she papered a single wall in inky cheetah speckles. A rug’s crazy quilt of browns is enlivened by a ribbed texture.<br />“A lot of stuff can work as long as you stay within parameters,” said Ms. Murray of her focused formula. “I don’t like to introduce a color that isn’t found anywhere else, because it becomes an eyesore.” This dictum also applies to black. In this room, she used both the lamps and the throw to introduce bits of punctuating ebony. “You can’t have [black] in a vacuum,” she said.<br />The result? A careful marriage of vivacity and quietude that may well lull one to sleep—but not out of boredom.</td>

      <td>Chinese health authorities said a man contracted a rare strain of the virus</td>
      <td>Chinese health authorities said a 41-year-old man had contracted a rare strain of bird flu known as H10N3 and had been in the hospital since late April, calling it the first reported human case globally from the strain. The National Health Commission said the man developed a fever and other symptoms on April 23 and was admitted to hospital in Jiangsu province five days later. On Tuesday the health commission said his condition was stable and indicated he was ready to be discharged.<br />The health commission didn’t give details on how the man came into contact with the virus. Cases of bird flu in humans have most commonly been reported among those in close daily contact with poultry, such as chicken farmers. The commission advised the public to avoid contact with sick and dead poultry.<br />Avian influenza can be fatal in humans. Highly pathogenic strains, such as H5N1, can have a mortality rate of about 60%, according to the World Health Organization. However, the WHO says, bird flu doesn’t spread easily from birds to people.<br />China has seen several outbreaks of bird flu, including one at the height of the coronavirus outbreak last year, when H5N1 avian influenza killed 4,500 chickens in central Hunan province, prompting authorities to cull another nearly 18,000 birds.<br />In May, China’s Agriculture Ministry said the H5N8 strain of bird flu killed hundreds of wild birds in Tibet, prompting authorities to disinfect areas including a national wetland park.</td>

Hospitalizations climbed in late June, followed by a steady rise in fatalities after the first week of July.<br />This year, epidemiologists and public-health officials are hopeful that despite millions of Americans traveling for the weekend and the broad rollback of pandemic restrictions, newly reported Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths will remain low as more of the country continues to get vaccinated, albeit at lower rates.<br />“We have seen after holiday weekends in the past that cases have risen, but we’ve never been in a position where we’ve had almost half the adults of America vaccinated and protected from this virus,” said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky last week.<br />Dr. Walensky nevertheless warned the virus remained dangerous for the unvaccinated. She encouraged those who hadn’t gotten a Covid-19 shot to do so and in the meantime continue wearing masks and practicing physical distancing.</td>

The goal was to investigate why and how company founders bond with their ventures.<br />The result: When entrepreneurs think about their businesses, their brain patterns are very similar to the brain patterns of parents thinking about their children. Those findings shed light on why entrepreneurs run companies the way they do—and how they ought to.<br />In the experiment, researchers used a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging to see which parts of the participants’ brains were activated by a series of pictures. Entrepreneurs were shown photos of their business—such as the logo and product or service—as well as of other companies. The parents saw images of their own children, and other people’s.</td>

      <td>The surprising adventures of a social-media climber who grew his following by 20%—and what the pros say he did right and wrong</td>
      <td>WHY WOULD ANYONEwant more Instagram followers?” sighed a friend two summers ago. “Mine just plague me with emojis in the comments.” With 8,000 fans, she could get 300 likes just by aiming her phone down and haphazardly photographing her feet. I’d attracted a mere 950 followers; none was blindly interested in photos of my limbs. This seemed problematic. As the editor of a newspaper’s lifestyle section when Instagram was increasingly defining lifestyle trends, I considered it a professional duty to conquer the platform and acquire enough followers to be plagued at least a little. Besides, I was feeling competitive.<br />Mastering the science of growing my account became my summer project. To prepare, I watched dozens of YouTube videos in which platform pros talked very fast, outlining “tricks” and “secrets.” Here are the 10 strategies I considered or tested, driving my follower count up 20% in three months—along with updated commentary from two of those loquacious experts:<br />The pros loudly concurred: To really grow your fan base, pick a single subject so your posts will reliably satisfy would-be followers with similar interests. Dogs. Saggy old houses. Exhaustingly elaborate desserts. “You need to offer one consistent value proposition,” said Ben Leavitt, a social-media guru in Guelph, Ontario, who’s created 53 YouTube videos drilling such principles into hopeful Instagrammers. But I just couldn’t do it. I resisted reducing myself to one dimension and didn’t have time to produce a steady stream of wearying tartlets. So I stuck with what Vancouver-based Instagram expert Vanessa Lau pityingly calls a “panoply” of topics. The only thing my posts have in common, she said after perusing my feed recently, is “really charming captions. Sell that in your Instagram profile bio.” That seems like an embarrassing “niche,” but Ms. Lau stars in 70 odd videos on Instagram success, one with 5.8 million views.<br />This I did promptly. (Anyone can do so for free. Make the switch in “Edit Profile.”) “Professional” status lets you access “Insights,” metrics that track how many impressions your hashtags generated, how many shares or follows each post got. You can determine what’s working and try to do more of that. I quickly learned, beyond its paltry 37 likes, why my photo of a forgotten 1970s supermodel was a dud. It got no shares, even if her curly hair had (as I put it) “a matted, Little Orphan Annie intensity.” Said Ms. Lau diplomatically: Insights “let you optimize your strategy based on your findings.”<br />“If you tell Instagram ‘I’m active on this account,’” said Ms. Lau, “it rewards you.” And potentially exposes your content to non-followers susceptible to your wiles. I obediently posted at 1 p.m., when my followers were most active, according to my Insights. Producing good photos daily nearly killed me, given that I spent my hours in a cubicle, not picturesque Fiji or a photogenic alternative circus. At one low point, I desperately snapped a giant iPhone projected on a giant screen in my slightly sci-fi newsroom. One charitable new follower proved susceptible.</td>

      <td>Annual sales event will be final Prime Day with Jeff Bezos as CEO</td>
      <td>Amazon.com Inc.  said it would hold its Prime Day on June 21 and 22 in the U.S. and other countries, returning the annual sales event to midyear after the pandemic altered its timing last year.<br />The event this year is scheduled a bit earlier than the normal July date, which aims to capitalize on a seasonal shopping lull with sales on millions of items. Other retailers have in past years held competing events near Prime Day with deals to attract shoppers.  Walmart Inc.  on Wednesday said it plans to hold a sales event called “Deals for Days” from June 20 to 23 featuring items in stores and online.<br />This year’s Prime Day comes just before Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to step down as chief executive. Andy Jassy, head of Amazon’s cloud computing business, is set to assume the CEO role on July 5, while Mr. Bezos becomes executive chairman.<br />Amazon held last year’s shopping fest in October as the Covid-19 pandemic and a rise in online shopping during lockdowns strained delivery networks and caused delays earlier in the year. The later event provided a jump-start to the holiday shopping season and fueled record quarterly sales for the online retailing giant.<br />Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said that having Prime Day return to an earlier date is good for the industry as a whole. Having it in the fall last year “added a lot of pressure to delivery and fulfillment operations that were already under stress as the holiday approached,” he said.</td>

      <td>From space-age lawn chairs to chargers that can power a mini fridge, our recommendations will make your 2021 setup the envy of your face-painted neighbors</td>
      <td>WHEN CHEZ CHESAK goes back to tailgating this year, he’ll have plenty of company. A New England Patriots fan who’s now living in Cincinnati, the 51-year-old belongs to an “expat” club that already has more than 100 Patriots zealots signed up to travel to Indianapolis this football season when their team plays the Colts. “I miss the camaraderie, energy and excitement,” said Mr. Chesak.<br />Tailgating gear has improved tremendously since you, too, last partied in a parking lot with friends, family and face-painted strangers. So think about what you’re packing before you storm the asphalt, making up for lost time. From coolers that double as on-the-go kitchens to energizing speakers and portable chargers that can power all of your devices, we found the gear to ensure this year’s festivities are worth the wait.<br />This modern lawn chair retains the best traits of the classics—woven webbing, easy setup—but adds handsome beech wood armrests and a detachable cooler underneath to keep drinks and snacks handy. An aircraft-grade aluminum frame means the chair is light enough to wear as a backpack (with straps), yet strong enough to support a 350-pound fan. Our favorite feature is the height: Unlike many camp chairs whose undersides practically scrape the ground, the Voyager sits higher to make getting in and out easier. ($220, parkitmovement.com)<br />Once you’re inside the stadium, these Nikon binoculars will let you read the catcher’s signs from the nosebleeds. A top-mounted lever makes for easy switching between four zoom distances with your index finger, while coated optics brighten the view. It weighs less than a bottled water, so you won’t strain your neck during the seventh-inning stretch. ($150, nikonusa.com)<br />Your smart speaker from home won’t do in a WiFi-less stadium parking lot. Instead, opt for JBL’s new, thermos-size speaker with Bluetooth connectivity, great sound and a 20-hour battery life per charge. The Charge 5 is waterproof in case of spilled suds, and, should it tumble off a table, its rugged housing will ensure it hits the asphalt intact. ($180, jbl.com)</td>

      <td>Choosing your own job title is one of the freedoms of being an entrepreneur. But be careful—the title you choose can make a difference in how you’re perceived.<br />That is according to research published in the Journal of Business Venturing Insights from University College London academics James Berry and Janice Sanchez. The authors discovered that founders who use the title “entrepreneur” are seen as less competent than founders who call themselves “CEO” or “scientist.”<br />On the other hand, those who dub themselves entrepreneurs are seen as “warmer” than others—good-natured, sincere and trustworthy.<br />That means that business owners should think carefully about which title they use in which context, say the authors of the study, which surveyed 286 people to determine societal perceptions of four different titles—entrepreneur, scientist, advertiser and CEO—in terms of competence and warmth.<br />“Remember that when you’re shaking somebody’s hand, what you say doesn’t have to mirror what’s written on your business card,” Dr. Berry says.</td>

      <td>Naples, Fla.<br />The last case she taped for “Judge Judy” didn’t deviate in style from the roughly 12,750 cases before it. Wearing a black robe, lace collar and expression of intense focus, Judy Sheindlin heard a typical dispute—contractor suing for payment, client claiming shoddy work—which she dispatched with signature jabs like “That’s baloney” and “Don’t waste my time.”<br />The judge gave no farewell remarks from the bench. When the episode airs June 8—others taped earlier will air later—only one detail will make it stand out among reruns for years to come: a glittery, bee-shaped clip Ms. Sheindlin wore in her hair. It was a wink to fans, and a nod to her Queen Bee production company at the end of a 25-year reign over daytime television.<br />Ms. Sheindlin has been an unwavering force in an industry where names like Oprah made more splash. “Judge Judy,” the No. 1 first-run show in syndicated TV for 11 consecutive seasons, looks on track to end with a 12th, with an average 7.8 million viewers.<br />The broadcast landscape, dictated by the rhythms of talk shows, doctor shows and court shows leading up to the local news, is in flux as audiences break with old routines and studios sell more programs to streaming platforms. At age 78, Ms. Sheindlin is headed for streaming, too, instead of retirement. Next on her docket: a new court show that will premiere on  Amazon ’s  free, ad-supported streaming service, IMDb TV, later this year.</td>

      <td>Voters in Peru could elect Pedro Castillo, leader of a Marxist party, as president as region deals with economic and Covid-19 crises</td>
      <td>Latin America, which led developing nations in adopting a market-friendly model of economic development, may now be leading them away from it. On Sunday, voters in Peru could elect as president Pedro Castillo, leader of a Marxist party that seeks to nationalize foreign-owned mines, invokes Lenin and Fidel Castro, and questions democratic institutions such as a free press.<br />On the same day, Mexicans will decide how much control over Congress to give their leftist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Since taking office in 2018, he has expanded state control of oil, gas and electricity while undercutting the independence of the judiciary. And just weeks ago, Chileans elected a far-left slate of delegates to rewrite their constitution. A leftist already governs Argentina and polls suggest one could win Brazil’s presidential election next year.<br />While Latin America is no stranger to economic and political turmoil, the circumstances this time are quite different. The collapsing currencies, runaway government debt and hyperinflation that regularly plunged the region into devastating crises are largely absent (Venezuela and Argentina excepted). For that, thank the “Washington consensus,” a suite of policies including keeping budgets and inflation under control championed by the region’s finance ministers and central bankers, many trained at U.S. schools.<br />And yet in the past decade Latin America failed to achieve what mattered most: durable economic growth. Even before Covid-19, the region was stagnating. Per capita gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation and currency purchasing power, was the same in 2019 as in 2011. In that time China’s grew 66%, India’s 52%. Covid-19 knocked Latin American per capita incomes back another 8%, the International Monetary Fund estimates.<br />Latin America still lags behind in part because its rates of saving and investment remain far below Asia’s, and because of its dependence on commodities, which boomed on the back of Chinese demand, then went bust.</td>

In the U.S. those concerns have been compounded by the Biden administration’s fiscal stimulus package, which is unmatched in any other part of the world economy.<br />“Market worries surrounding high and accelerating inflation stem from the risk that pent-up demand, strong fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s commitment to keep policy rates on hold will cause overheating,” said  Moody’s Investors Service  in a note on the inflation outlook.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden will meet Wednesday with the Senate Republican leading GOP efforts to craft infrastructure legislation, as the two sides continue to seek common ground ahead of a Biden administration deadline next week to show progress in the negotiations.<br />The White House meeting between the president and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.) comes after Senate Republicans unveiled a new plan to spend $928 billion over eight years to update roads, bridges, rail and transit systems. That offer is an increase from the GOP’s original five-year $568 billion proposal but it still left the two sides far apart.<br />Mr. Biden is “appreciative and heartened by the good-faith effort that we’ve seen from Republican senators,” White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday. But, she added, “We do need to finish these negotiations soon,” reiterating what the president said last week.<br />Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Sunday on CNN that infrastructure talks need to show a “clear direction” toward an agreement by the time Congress returns from its recess on June 7. Democrats have the power to use their narrow control of the House and Senate to approve legislation without Republican support if they stay united, though the White House and some Democrats have pushed for a bipartisan approach to infrastructure.<br />Mrs. Capito on Fox News on Sunday expressed optimism that a deal could get done, pointing out that the two sides had inched toward each other. She acknowledged that despite their efforts, it was possible they wouldn’t come to an agreement by the deadline.</td>

      <td>The Palestinian militant group Hamas has seen a surge in cryptocurrency donations since the start of the armed conflict with Israel last month, a senior official with the group said, exploiting a trend in online fundraising that has enabled it to circumvent international sanctions to fund its military operations.<br />The international attention to the recent fighting drew new eyeballs to websites run by Hamas’s armed wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and that surge translated into donations for its military operations, the senior Hamas official said.<br />“There was definitely a spike” in bitcoin donations, he said. “Some of the money gets used for military purposes to defend the basic rights of the Palestinians.”<br />Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, is designated by the U.S., the EU and other Western nations as a terrorist entity. Those sanctions forced it to turn years ago to covert methods of financing outside the international banking system. As the cryptocurrency industry grew, Hamas began capitalizing on its ability to make transactions anonymous.<br />The Hamas official, who spoke on condition he not be named, declined to say how much cryptocurrency the group has received but said its proportion of overall revenue was rising. Last year, U.S. federal authorities seized more than $1 million in cryptocurrency tied to the al-Qassam Brigades.</td>

      <td>Altria  Group Inc. and the Federal Trade Commission are set to square off over allegations that the Marlboro maker engaged in anticompetitive practices ahead of its 2018 investment in e-cigarette startup Juul Labs Inc.<br />The FTC is expected to argue in an antitrust trial starting Wednesday that Altria pulled its e-cigarettes off the U.S. market illegally at the insistence of Juul as the two companies were discussing a deal, according to legal filings. Altria is expected to argue that its e-cigarettes were failures, and it jettisoned them amid regulatory pressure and an internal reckoning about the company’s inability to develop a vaping product that consumers liked, filings say.<br />If the FTC prevails, it could unwind Altria’s 35% interest in Juul, which the Marlboro maker bought in December 2018 for $12.8 billion. The agency is seeking to force Altria to divest its stake and terminate the companies’ noncompete agreement. The case will be heard by an administrative law judge, who will make an initial decision; the agency’s commissioners will then vote on the matter.<br />Altria made a big bet on Juul because its sleek vaporizers were fueling a surge in the e-cigarette market and hastening the decline of cigarettes. Its investment made Juul one of the highest-valued startups in the U.S.<br />But the e-cigarette maker’s sales have tumbled and its growth prospects have darkened. Blamed for an increase in underage vaping, Juul has faced regulatory crackdowns, lawsuits and investigations into its marketing practices. Altria valued its stake in Juul at $1.5 billion as of March. Altria’s losses led to the departure last year of Chief Executive Howard Willard, who spearheaded the deal.</td>

      <td>JEJU, South Korea—One Sunday afternoon in the fall of 2019, a congregation of Christians in China’s southern city of Shenzhen crammed into a rented office space to debate one of the biggest decisions of their lives: whether they should stay in China or seek exile in South Korea.<br />Chinese authorities regard the Shenzhen Holy Reformed Church, an unregistered “family church” founded in 2012, as illegal. Its members say they have faced government harassment for years. Some members felt the pressure had grown too much to bear.<br />Over three hours, more than 50 debated the proposal. Some wanted to leave to ensure their children could continue their religious schooling. Some worried about finding jobs, or being forced back to China. Emotions ran high and tears were shed, participants recalled.<br />When the church reconvened for a vote the following Sunday, the result was decisive: 56 members in favor of relocating versus 17 against.<br />Under China’s leader, Xi Jinping, the Communist Party has tightened control over all aspects of society, from business to religion, and suppressed dissent with growing vigor. That has pushed more ordinary Chinese to try to leave.</td>

      <td>Western producers’ transition plans create an opportunity for state-backed peers that are insulated from shareholder pressure over their climate impact</td>
      <td>The oil industry could face a golden sunset, particularly for companies still developing new reserves. How long it lasts depends on the speed at which economies shift to cleaner energy sources.<br />On Tuesday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and friends, including Russia, agreed to open the taps a bit. Supply cuts have been crucial in stabilizing crude prices in the face of pandemic-induced demand fluctuations, but producers are now more optimistic. Vaccines are rolling out and economies are reopening. Oil prices are at a two-year high.<br />While big listed companies will benefit, they cannot take full advantage, faced with growing shareholder pressure to limit petroleum investments and cut greenhouse-gas emissions. European supermajors  Shell ,  Total Energies and  BP  have already limited plans to find new oil reserves, and now U.S. peers  Chevron  and  Exxon  are rethinking investments too.<br />In contrast, state-controlled rivals are free to drill to meet future oil demand with scant consideration of their carbon footprint. Most state-run producers answer to domestic politicians in emerging economies more focused on cash flow, local jobs and tax revenues than environmental concerns.<br />“The part of development projects that are being operated by OPEC members is going to increase substantially over the next 20 years,” says Per Magnus Nysveen, analyst at consulting firm Rystad Energy. “National oil companies have quite a lot of really nice development projects with low break-even prices down below $30 a barrel.”</td>

Messrs. Alliegro and Burke were previously executives at Invention Science Fund, a startup incubator at Intellectual Ventures that spun out several startups commercializing advances in metamaterials.<br />Metamaterials are engineered materials arranged in repeating structures at a nano and microscale in a way that gives them acoustic, electromagnetic, mechanical and other properties not found in nature.<br />New lenses, antennas, sensors and other devices that are lighter and have no moving parts are under development based on the technology, with applications in optical computing, virtual reality, automotive, energy, space and many other sectors. The technology could help replace bulky VR headsets, for example, or enable moving vehicles to have satellite communication via light, flat antennas.</td>

      <td>Sharp focus on enterprise customers and new services should ease post-pandemic transition</td>
      <td>Sometimes, being a verb isn’t all it is cracked up to be, as  Zoom Video Communications  can attest.<br />While Zoom’s zippy video-communications platform made the company into the Covid-19 pandemic’s superstar, being synonymous with virtual cocktail parties and other oddities over the past year has its drawbacks. Business for the company has continued to soar, but few stocks have had it rougher in the so-called recovery trade. Zoom’s share price has sunk 35% since  Pfizer  reported a vaccine breakthrough Nov. 9. The Nasdaq Composite—home to many other pandemic-boosted names—has gained 15% in value since then.<br />The company’s fiscal first-quarter results reported late Tuesday should help reverse that slide a bit. Revenue surged 191% year over year to about $956 million, beating the company’s own projection and Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $905 million. Zoom lifted its forecast for the full fiscal year ending in January and projected for the current quarter revenue of $985 million to $990 million—the midpoint of which was about 6% ahead of analysts’ forecasts. Zoom’s share price rose 2% in after-hours trading.<br />To be sure, Zoom’s growth rate in a normalized world will look nothing like what the company saw over the past 12 months, when videoconferencing was the only way for many to have a face-to-face with someone they weren’t living with. But the company has been smartly shifting back to its business-focused roots. The company said earlier this year that it would license its videoconferencing technology to other businesses, which could help drive use of its network.<br />New services such as Zoom Phone, which can replace aging office telecommunications systems, and Zoom Rooms, used for dedicated videoconferencing rooms, should also get a boost from hybrid work environments, in which in-office personnel regularly mix with remote workers. Zoom said Tuesday it has now sold 1.5 million seats for Zoom Phone, up from one million at the beginning of the year. In a recent report, Karl Keirstead of UBS noted that the “post-pandemic end state appears to be work-from-anywhere (virtually from home or in the office) which should help support continued spending on collaboration software for years to come.”</td>

      <td>It helps to be familiar with the basics and the difference between a cash-out refinance and a Heloc</td>

It is the highest level on record since 2007, but still below the $84 billion quarterly cash-out volume in 2006.<br />Jenny Puls is one such homeowner. After looking for a larger house for more than a year, Mrs. Puls decided she was better off adding a second floor to her family’s 1,600 square-foot craftsman-style home than buying in this year’s overheated market.<br />“We just ran out of room; my office had to become the nursery,” says Mrs. Puls, a Realtor who has a 9-month-old daughter.<br />Her Houston-area home had appreciated to $645,000 from the $220,000 she paid a decade ago. She cashed out $336,000 and refinanced to a new 30-year fixed mortgage of $500,000 at 3% in order to add two bedrooms, an extra living room and a kitchen expansion. Though her monthly mortgage payments doubled, and she has had to pull $40,000 out-of-pocket to finish financing the renovations, she says this was the better option for her.</td>

McDonald’s Corp.  in February gave executives annual incentives to increase the share of women and racial minorities in leadership roles by 2025. In March,  Nike Inc.  said it would for the first time tie some executive pay to five-year goals for improving racial and gender diversity in its workforce and leadership positions.<br />“Metrics like these seem to be new, a kind of new evolution in what’s expected of executives,” said Rick Hernandez, the chairman of McDonald’s board, who was involved in the fast-food chain’s compensation changes. “It’s really a growth, a maturation of thinking about what’s really good for a company and what a company’s role is in society, how you serve your customers and at the same time serving your investors.”<br />While some directors and executives have for years encouraged colleagues to recruit more women and minorities, observers say the discussions have become more prevalent and explicit. Pressure from institutional investors, employees and customers has helped drive companies to establish financial incentives for improving what is often referred to as diversity, equity and inclusion.</td>

      <td>A key measure of investors’ inflation expectations has slipped in recent days, stirring debate over whether it has finally peaked after this year’s near-relentless climb.<br />As of Tuesday, the gauge known as the 10-year break-even rate suggested that the consumer-price index will rise by an annual average of 2.48% over the next decade, according to Tradeweb. That was up from 2.01% at the end of last year, but down from its recent high of 2.57% on May 12.<br />The ups and down of the break-even rate have come under scrutiny in recent months as investors have grown increasingly concerned about inflation. A leveling off of or decline in the rate will cheer those who have worried that accelerating inflation could threaten investors’ portfolios in a way it hasn’t for decades. But it may also reflect expectations for tighter monetary policies from the Fed, which could drag on riskier assets like stocks.<br />Two assets determine the break-even rate: nominal U.S. Treasurys and Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, which increase their payouts as the consumer-price index rises. When investors buy TIPS, the yields on the securities are typically lower than nominal Treasurys of the same maturity. That difference is called the break-even rate because holders of TIPS can ultimately earn the same return as holders of nominal Treasurys if average annual CPI inflation matches that gap over the life of the bonds.<br />As of Tuesday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 1.613%, while the yield on the 10-year TIPS was around minus 0.867%.</td>

That forced Weatherford to shed jobs, cut costs and pare down assets, as energy producers slashed capital spending, the lifeblood of oil-field services companies.<br />With fuel demand and oil-industry activity picking up again, Weatherford is now looking to expand its market share in advanced energy technologies in the midst of steadier results, Chief Executive Officer Girish Saligram said in an interview.</td>

That is something to keep an eye on: Any attempt to prevent it from rallying further would provide fresh fuel for a clash between Beijing and Washington over currency manipulation.<br />At around 6.38 to the U.S. dollar, the yuan is at its strongest level since 2018. The currency needs to rise by only a little over 5% to hit a historical high. It has rallied by almost 12% in the past year already.<br />The PBOC said Monday that it would raise foreign-exchange reserve requirements for banks after a former central-bank official suggested to state media over the weekend that the currency’s recent strength wasn’t sustainable or desirable.<br />Given the central bank’s clear discomfort with the rally, the fact that China’s foreign-exchange reserves have barely risen in the past year is eyebrow raising. In the 2000s and early 2010s, China’s large trade surpluses were mirrored by large reserve accumulation.<br />Since the beginning of 2020, Chinese reserves have risen by 2.9% in U.S. dollar terms, compared with increases of 10.6% and 13.2% in South Korea and Taiwan, two economies that have recorded similarly strong export growth and strengthening currencies during the pandemic.</td>

      <td>Rhode Island state regulators have approved the sale of two privately held hospitals in the state, ending an impasse between the regulators and the hospitals’ owners that threatened to close them.<br />But to secure regulatory approval the hospitals’ owner, Prospect Medical Holdings Inc., and its private-equity backer, Leonard Green & Partners, had to agree to certain stipulations, including setting aside $80 million to help secure the two hospitals’ futures.<br />The agreement ends a more than one year review by Rhode Island regulators into Prospect’s operations and finances. The hospital operator said in late April that without approval it could be forced to shut down the two Providence-area hospitals, Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital. The deal also paves the way for Leonard Green to fully exit its stake in the hospital operator after more than a decade by selling it back to the company’s management.<br />Prospect Medical said Tuesday in a statement that it had completed its transaction with Leonard Green, and thanked the firm for its “collaborative leadership and contributions” as Prospect became a national healthcare provider. It manages 17 hospitals across the U.S.<br />In a statement outlining the basic terms of the agreement, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said that it was necessary for the company’s new majority owners to make “upfront financial commitments” to support the hospitals.</td>

      <td>The sharp acceleration in inflation has been driven by surging energy prices, and central bankers expect it to be temporary</td>
      <td>The annual rate of inflation in the eurozone rose in May to hit the European Central Bank’s target for the first time since late 2018, as energy prices surged in response to a strengthening recovery in the global economy.<br />The pickup in price rises comes before a June 10 meeting of policy makers at the eurozone’s central bank, which will consider new economic forecasts and whether to continue stimulus programs launched early in the pandemic.<br />The central bank’s March forecasts saw inflation reaching 2% only in the final three months of this year. But figures released by the European Union’s statistics office Tuesday showed that inflation had already reached that level.<br />The central bank targets an inflation rate of just under 2%.<br />Consumer prices were falling as recently as December. The speed of the turnaround will likely energize a debate among policy makers about whether the pickup is a temporary consequence of economies reopening—or something more durable.</td>

Students can click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before June 15. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />A Good Way to Inflate Tuition<br />Canceling student loan debt is a short-term solution that will only encourage universities to raise tuition. They won’t lose applicants over cost increases. Parents who can’t pay will expect the feds to step in. As a result, the next generation of students will be met with the same or worse debt problems, causing another student-loan cancellation initiative. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, every dollar in subsidized loans results in a 60-cent increase in the sticker price of college tuition.<br />To break this vicious circle, the government needs to lower tuition costs by getting out of the credit market for student loans and developing a more cost-effective way for all Americans, regardless of income, to attend college. The government could promote community colleges and trade schools over the traditional university experience, for example. Then the discussion can begin on how to deal with existing student debt.</td>

It’s water from the fountain of our soul. . . That’s why I say that I’ll serve any person, but I won’t communicate all messages. Serving people is merely about recognizing each individual as a person worthy of respect, made in the image of God. I’m not trying to force any person to see the world the way I do, or to embrace my beliefs about God and the Bible. If you want to reject Jesus and purchase a cupcake, go ahead. I’ll gladly sell you that cupcake, and a cup of coffee to go with it, maybe even engage in a conversation about our differences.<br />But asking me to draw on my creativity to communicate a message I believe is wrong? That’s asking me to stop being me. . . . To deny the deepest convictions of my heart, and pretend I haven’t learned the most difficult lessons of my life, or that they don’t matter. That’s not something any person has the right to ask of another. Or a command any government has the right to force one of its citizens to obey.</td>

      <td>Latin America’s biggest economy grew 1.2% in the first quarter, propelled by agricultural exports</td>
      <td>Brazil’s economy has returned to pre-pandemic levels, lifted by the biggest stimulus in emerging markets and a return to normal activity by many Brazilians who have ignored scientists’ calls to remain in lockdown as Covid-19 rages across the country.<br />In data released Tuesday, the economy grew 1.2% from the fourth quarter, boosted by agricultural exports, taking Latin America’s biggest economy back to its size at the end of 2019 before the beginning of the pandemic. Economists had forecast growth of less than 1%.<br />“People were up and about, generating GDP, but at a cost to public health, as we saw from the Covid numbers,” said Alberto Ramos, an economist at Goldman Sachs. But much of the growth came from pent-up demand during the pandemic, he said, adding that the country is still struggling to diversify its economy away from commodities.<br />“We have to grow the hard way, which is through investment and productivity growth, and that’s a challenge for Brazil,” Mr. Ramos said.<br />As Brazilians fill shopping malls and bars, about 77 people are still dying from Covid-19 every hour in the country. More than 460,000 Brazilians have died from the disease so far.</td>

      <td>President Biden rejoined the World Health Organization as one of his first official acts, and his Administration has vowed to “strengthen and reform” it. That effort isn’t going well, as last week’s World Health Assembly shows.<br />The annual WHO confab started badly as China succeeded in blocking Taiwan’s participation—and embarrassing the U.S. in the process. The island democracy, which hoped to participate as an observer, has one of the world’s best records combatting Covid-19 and could spread its lessons to the world.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinkensaid last month that there is “no reasonable justification for Taiwan’s continued exclusion from this forum,” and the G-7 nations supported its participation. But China, which tries to block Taiwan from all international institutions, prevailed over the Western democracies.<br />Then on Friday the World Health Assembly voted to appoint Syria and Belarus to WHO’s executive board, which sets the governing body’s agenda and implements its policies. Video of the vote shows it proceeding with neither debate nor objections.<br />These board seats reward Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose regime has slaughtered its own people and bombed hospitals; and Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko, who hijacked a passenger aircraft last month to arrest a critic. Syria will be represented by Minister of Health Hassan Mohammad Al Ghabbash, who was sanctioned by the U.K. for sharing responsibility “for the Syrian regime’s violent repression against the civilian population.”</td>

      <td>Reports that two Iranian frigates may be steaming into the Atlantic toward Venezuela ought to concentrate minds in the Biden Administration. So much for Iranian goodwill amid President Biden’s determination to rejoin the 2015 nuclear deal.<br />The vessels’ destination isn’t clear, and they could still turn back. But when asked by reporters on Monday about U.S. monitoring of the frigates, an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said “Iran has constant presence in international waters, is entitled to this right on the basis of international law, and can be present in international waters.” He added: “I warn that nobody should make a miscalculation. Those who live in glass houses must be cautious.”<br />Iran’s navy isn’t the U.S. Sixth Fleet, but the entry of warships into Caribbean waters would be a notable provocation. If it sails into these waters without resistance, a precedent will be set for adversarial navies operating in the region. Don’t be surprised if Russia and China decide to join the party in the future.<br />Iran is a long-time Cuban ally, and since Hugo Chávez turned Venezuela into a dictatorship 20 years ago, Tehran has nurtured an ever-closer relationship with Caracas. The two regimes have engaged in joint defense ventures in the Venezuelan state of Aragua, and Venezuela is known to supply fake identities to Iranian operatives to move around the region.<br />Venezuela’s point man for Iran is Tareck El Aissami, now oil minister. Iran is an essential energy supplier for the South American basket case, where domestic gasoline production has collapsed amid a shortage of resources, maintenance failures and corruption.</td>
