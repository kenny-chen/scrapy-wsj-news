The company also didn’t adequately notify employees of infected co-workers, according to the complaint.</td>

Unfortunately one student was shot dead.”<br />A photograph shared by the governor’s security officials showed the body of a student on the back of a pickup truck covered in a leaves.

      <td>SYDNEY—The new chief executive officer of  Rio Tinto  PLC wants to change a risk-averse culture at the world’s second-largest mining company that could see it pursue commodities vital to the energy transition more aggressively.<br />Jakob Stausholm said mining companies had become too cautious after overpaying for deals around a decade ago during a rush to feed China with metals and minerals vital to its industrialization, which left them vulnerable to hefty asset write-downs when commodity prices fell.<br />Facing an investor backlash at the time, companies including Rio Tinto moved to prioritize dividends to shareholders and buying back shares over deals or investments in new mines that could turn sour.<br />Rio Tinto’s annual result on Wednesday continued that trend. A 22% rise in net profit to $9.77 billion paved the way for a record final dividend and a special dividend in what was Mr. Stausholm’s first earnings update since succeeding Jean-Sébastien Jacques as CEO on Jan. 1. Mr. Jacques was ousted last year amid the fallout from the destruction of ancient rock shelters in a remote part of Australia.<br />Rio Tinto’s increased profit was driven by a rally in iron-ore prices to a nine-year high. Iron ore is used to make steel and has been one of the hottest commodities as China bets on infrastructure, such as new highways and apartment construction, to drive its economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.</td>

That followed results from a small clinical trial in South Africa that found the AstraZeneca vaccine didn’t appear to protect recipients from developing mild or moderate illness from the fast-spreading new strain of the coronavirus first detected in the country.<br />The J&J vaccine was found to be 57% effective at preventing moderate and severe Covid-19 symptoms in a larger trial held in South Africa, including from the B.1.351 variant, which has become the predominant version there. That was lower than the 72% efficacy rate observed during J&J’s trial in the U.K., which vaccine experts attributed to the South African variant’s ability to partially escape the immune response triggered by some Covid-19 vaccines.<br />When looking at just severe Covid-19 cases, the J&J vaccine was found to be 85% effective, including in South Africa.<br /></td>

The authority says it would like to see 4,000 NYPD officers in the system.<br />City officials said Tuesday they would add 644 NYPD officers for a total of about 3,000 officers patrolling the sprawling system. They said such levels are sufficient and that the main challenge isn’t crime but the perception of crime.<br />NYPD officials say major crimes on the subway fell 31% last year compared with the previous year. “I think our subway system is the safest large transportation system in the world,” NYPD Chief of Transit Kathleen O’Reilly said at a news conference Tuesday.</td>

He added, “I would die for her,” in a video he posted to  Facebook  last month.<br />After being reported by people who witnessed the vaccination, he was targeted by prosecutors for criminal charges for demanding advantage as a public official, resigned and agreed to pay a $9,000 fine.<br />Brazil is only a month into its vaccination campaign against Covid-19, yet the country’s authorities have already been overwhelmed by several thousands of reports of people who circumvented the rules to get immunized before the most vulnerable.<br />Among those under investigation are politicians, influential business owners and lawyers, along with a host of other professionals, from veterinarians to fashion bloggers, most of whom incriminated themselves after posting vaccination selfies to social media, prosecutors said.

It also operates a marketplace for buying and selling digital ads using automated technology, which will help iHeart expand its offerings to the long tail of smaller, self-service ad buyers. Triton, whose customers include broadcasters, podcasters, and online music services in more than 50 countries, will continue to service clients outside of iHeart.<br />Podcasting has grown quickly over the past five years, and players in the space are vying for listeners and for increasing advertising revenue. The medium now attracts more than 100 million monthly active listeners, according to Edison Research.<br />The migration of listeners to on-demand audio, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, has sparked an arms race among major media and tech players, including  Spotify Technology SA,   Amazon.com Inc.  and  Sirius XM Holdings Inc.  U.S. ad revenue from podcasts is projected to exceed $1 billion this year, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.</td>

      <td>Vaccines and therapeutics for Covid-19 have been an unexpected windfall for the drug industry, but Wall Street is less enthusiastic about cash windfalls</td>
      <td>For big pharma, a fresh $15 billion in sales just isn’t what it used to be.<br />Vaccines and therapeutics for Covid-19 have been an unexpected windfall for the drug industry, and there is more where that came from as the pandemic drags on.  Pfizer  said earlier this month that it expects to book $15 billion in sales from its Covid-19 vaccine in 2021. To put that figure in context, it is roughly equivalent to Pfizer’s entire oncology and immunology revenue in 2020. Pfizer’s total top line was just under $42 billion in 2020. What is more, that vaccine sales forecast is very conservative, as it only includes sales from doses from existing contracts with governments. Meanwhile,  Gilead Sciences  announced that it expects to sell between $2 billion and $3 billion of its antiviral drug remdesivir in 2021. It booked $2.8 billion in sales of the drug in 2020, most of it in the fourth quarter.<br />You wouldn’t think the pandemic was generating unexpected revenue by looking at those companies’ share prices. Both Pfizer and Gilead are down about 20% from their pandemic-era highs, and both stocks peaked as their drugs approached the market. That performance stands in marked contrast to smaller vaccine developers such as  BioNTech ,   Moderna  and  Novavax .<br />There are some valid reasons for that underperformance. Wall Street tends to place a low value on blockbuster drug sales if that drug faces a short shelf life, often because of an expiring patent or the expected approval of a superior medication. Those concerns are only amplified in a public health emergency since the pandemic’s ultimate duration is uncertain.<br />Even if annual booster shots become the standard in Covid-19 vaccination, as some drug executives and health officials have predicted, the onset of new competition likely means a tougher pricing environment in the future. After all, the flu shot is given annually but isn’t an especially lucrative product for the drug industry. And governments will be far more inclined to drive a hard bargain for future orders once the crisis abates.</td>

      <td>Competition between payment firms including PayPal and Affirm is intensifying, but the territory they are vying for is huge and diverse</td>
      <td>Several financial technology firms are eager to grow in the expanding realm of “buy now, pay later” lending. There likely is room enough in this town for everyone, at least for now.<br />Last week, one company that just went public in January, Affirm Holdings, and another established digital giant,  PayPal Holdings ,  discussed how they plan to win in this emerging lending category of short-term credit for shopping purchases. Both have plenty to be excited about:  PayPal  launched its Pay in 4 product last year, and already generated $750 million in volume in the fourth quarter. Affirm grew volume 41% quarter over quarter in the last three months of 2020 and said it has logged promising results in beta tests of its major new partnership with rapidly growing Shopify.<br />The fact is that buy now pay later, or BNPL, is a somewhat loosely defined thing. Some digital purchase installment loans are for just a few weeks; others can be for years. Some are for small-dollar purchases of ephemera, others for expensive durable goods. And while BNPL payment volumes are growing rapidly—by more than 50% among four big providers through the first nine months of 2020, according to Autonomous Research—they collectively represent just a couple percentage points of global e-commerce spending, which is itself growing rapidly. That leaves plenty of volume to fight over between these firms, as well as others such as  Afterpay  and Klarna and established card companies and banks that evolve their products to mimic BNPL in some respects.<br />Even if there is plenty of consumer demand and transaction opportunity, competition can still bite by pushing down what merchants are willing to pay the loan providers. Still, there are many models. Merchants may pay little for smaller, shorter-term, lower risk installments. But they may pay more when the lender is willing to take on more duration and credit risk to help customers who wouldn’t otherwise make a purchase. Firms that can regularly deliver those kinds of buyers, especially via their own networks, would have the most defensible fees.<br />For a relatively newer company like Affirm, a small number of major deals for prominent placement, particularly with marketplaces such as Shopify, have the potential to power big growth. Meanwhile PayPal has close to 30 million merchants on its platform and integrates Pay in 4 into its existing checkout button and pricing, so it has vast room to grow. BNPL also is just one of a growing list of features for what PayPal terms its evolving consumer “super app,” like discounts, pay-with-rewards, crypto, bill payments and more. It is the firms that hold on to consumers and win other business from them that may emerge the biggest winners.</td>

He was arrested last year after disappearing during a visit to Dubai airport, before being paraded in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, in handcuffs. Mr. Kagame, who says Mr. Rusesabagina is a fugitive responsible for funding terrorism, denied he had been kidnapped but called the operation flawless.<br />The trial—which has been widely condemned by human-rights groups, members of U.S. Congress and the European Parliament, among others—is being seen as a signal that Rwanda’s government is prepared to reach far beyond its borders to squash dissent.<br />Mr. Kagame, in power for 20 years, has won plaudits for reducing poverty, attracting foreign capital from aid agencies and private investors, and winning support from Western leaders including Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.</td>

She watched a song-and-dance performance honoring the birthday of Kim Jong Il, the current leader’s late father, during the country’s “Day of the Shining Star” holiday.<br />Ms. Ri, first mentioned as Kim Jong Un’s wife in 2012, initially appeared often in state media, a move that Pyongyang watchers said was aimed at humanizing the fresh-faced dictator. In 2018, she traveled to Beijing when her husband met Chinese leader Xi Jinping, then later played host during other state visits to Pyongyang by foreign leaders like South Korean President Moon Jae-in.</td>

      <td>Australian politicians want digital platforms to pay media companies more for their content. Regulators world-wide are watching closely.</td>
      <td>The tussle between Big Tech and a government Down Under is a preview of the battle to come globally.<br />The Australian Parliament started debate this week on legislation to force digital platforms to negotiate with media companies on payment for news. Under the proposed law, if the two sides fail to reach a deal, they would be brought to binding arbitration. The bill would also require technology companies to give notice to news companies of algorithm changes that will materially affect traffic and to give the publishers collective-bargaining power. The government would determine which tech platforms are subject to the law, but it would likely start with  Google  and  Facebook ,  the dominant companies in online advertising. With bipartisan support, the legislation will likely pass soon.<br />The two American companies have pushed back hard. Google threatened last year to shut down its search engine in Australia. Facebook has said users in the country might not be allowed to share links to news articles if the bill is passed.<br />But the looming legislation seems to be forcing the two tech giants to the negotiating table. Google reached agreements with two of the country’s largest broadcasters this week, including a deal equivalent to $23.3 million a year deal with Nine Entertainment, according to local media.<br />While Australia is a small market for the companies—its online advertising market was valued at only $7 billion in 2019, according to Interactive Advertising Bureau—the new law could have big repercussions if other countries follow suit. The European Union overhauled its copyright laws in 2019, though the changes seem more limited in scope and power. How well the Australian approach works could end up shaping the regulatory direction there. European officials proposed two bills for regulating internet companies last month.</td>

      <td>Fourth-quarter results mark a sharp turnaround for the fashion house after years of outperformance</td>
      <td>PARIS—Gucci fell further behind its big competitors in the fourth quarter, as the Italian fashion house stumbled without tourist shoppers filling its boutiques during the pandemic.<br />Revenue at Gucci for the quarter was 2.3 billion euros, equivalent to $2.8 billion and down 14% from a year earlier, parent company  Kering SA  said Wednesday. For the entire year, revenue fell 23% to €7.4 billion.<br />The results mark a sharp turnaround for Gucci after years of outperformance under Creative Director Alessandro Michele. In the fourth quarter, Gucci lagged well behind the leading fashion brands of  LVMH  Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy SE: Louis Vuitton and Dior.<br />Those two brands reported surging revenue in the second half of last year after the industry was allowed to reopen its boutiques following lockdowns across the world in the first half of 2020. Revenue at LVMH’s fashion and leather-goods division—which is mostly Louis Vuitton and Dior—rose 14% for the quarter.<br />The drop during the pandemic has exposed Gucci’s heavy reliance on tourist shoppers, particularly for stores in Europe that have depended on Chinese clientele coming to the region. The brand is in the midst of tweaking its image to burnish its appeal among clientele older than 40, an effort partly directed at Europeans.</td>

It plans to let users bet on “yes” or “no” answers to questions about future events. For instance, had the platform existed last year, it might have asked users whether a Covid-19 vaccine would be approved by the end of 2020.<br />The San Francisco-based startup hopes to benefit from surging interest in trading by individual investors. Individuals have jumped into stocks and options during the past year, using apps like those offered by Robinhood Markets Inc. Kalshi also hopes its marketplace will be used by people and businesses looking to hedge against risks that they face from future events.<br />Kalshi’s fundraising round comes after it won approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in November to run a derivatives exchange. Sequoia led the Series A round, which brings the total money raised by Kalshi since its 2018 founding to about $36 million.<br />Other investors in the round include Henry R. Kravis, the billionaire co-founder of private-equity giant KKR & Co. Inc., and SV Angel, a seed-stage venture firm whose investments have included  Airbnb Inc.  and  DoorDash Inc.  Earlier investors in Kalshi include Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley startup accelerator, and Justin Mateen, a co-founder of dating app Tinder.</td>

Merck  & Co. insiders sold $58 million of their shares. At  Novavax Inc.,  executives sold more than $40 million of their shares after the company’s vaccine hit milestones in August and September.<br />Merck, which last May said it was pursuing two vaccines, scrapped those efforts last month after data showed disappointing immune responses.

      <td>U.S. shoppers likely boosted their spending in January, buoyed by the stimulus payments that many Americans received in the most recent $900 billion Covid-19 relief package.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimated that retail sales—a measure of spending at stores, vehicle dealerships, restaurants and online—increased a seasonally adjusted 1.2% in January from a month earlier. The projected rise would follow three consecutive months of declining sales during the 2020 holiday shopping season.<br />Robert Rosener, senior U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, forecasts the report “will be the start of exiting the worst of the softer data winter we’ve seen,” with the $600-a-recipient stimulus checks distributed in early January the main factor driving an uptick in spending.<br />Still, he said he expects spending was uneven across sectors last month, with categories like apparel and restaurants continuing to suffer from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and social-distancing measures. The U.S. experienced a sharp surge in coronavirus cases after the holidays.<br />Allen Merry said he used his recent stimulus check to buy a used acoustic guitar from a local musical instrument shop.</td>

      <td>As richer nations secure supplies, poorer countries struggle to inoculate their populations</td>
      <td>In the race to vaccinate the world against Covid-19, developing countries are running dangerously behind as mutations of the virus make it harder to catch up—a situation that could spell at least another year of humanitarian and economic misery for poor nations.<br />The U.S. has now administered vaccine doses to around 15% of its population, while Europe has reached about 5%. But in South America, just 1.8% of the population had been given a vaccine by this week, while Asia reached 1.5% and Africa 0.1%, according to Our World in Data, a project based at Oxford University.<br />Almost 130 countries are yet to administer a single dose, the World Health Organization said recently. Just two countries in sub-Saharan Africa—the Seychelles and Mauritius—have started vaccinating a substantial proportion of front-line workers, though others are likely to roll out shots in the coming days.<br />The critically short supply of vaccines for poorer nations risks being curtailed further by the emergence of new variants of the virus, including in South Africa and Brazil, that appear to make some of the vaccines that have been secured less effective. Large parts of Africa and some countries in Latin America and Asia are unlikely to cover most of their populations before 2023 or 2024, experts say.<br />All that means it could be years before life returns to normal in poorer countries, which saw more than 100 million people fall back into extreme poverty last year and which lack resources to unleash government spending as much as rich countries have. Some emerging-market countries that were able to mount domestic stimulus last year are running out of resources to continue.</td>

Few are trying to do so while also spending billions of dollars to satisfy their regulators.<br />These are the tasks facing  Wells Fargo  & Co. Chief Executive Charles Scharf, who is attempting to slash at least $8 billion from the San Francisco bank’s annual budget. The bank’s expenses last year were $57.63 billion.<br />Wells Fargo is simultaneously shelling out money to remake the vast risk-and-control systems that regulators have said were inadequate to catch the fake-account scandal that got it in hot water more than four years ago. Wells is still subject to 10 regulatory penalties known as consent orders. The harshest, from the Federal Reserve, has capped the bank’s growth for three years.<br />How Wells Fargo fixes its back-end systems—and whether that clashes with other priorities—might hold clues for competitors as well. Wells came into the pandemic in worse financial shape than most large banks, but others must also modernize their controls while managing through the recession.<br />Citigroup Inc.  was hit with a $400 million fine over its own controls last year. The bank has been hiring key staff and making significant investments.  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. paid $250 million last year as a result of deficiencies in its internal controls, which it has remedied.</td>

But the prior relationship between Mr. LaPierre and the Brewer firm makes it “highly unlikely” that as the NRA’s counsel the Brewer firm would look into or advocate for any claims the group may have against him, the U.S. Trustee said.<br />“The statements in this legal filing, like others, reflect a misinformed view of the Brewer firm, its billings and its advocacy for the NRA,” said Charles L. Cotton, first vice president of the NRA. “I, and all the officers, fully support the work the firm is doing, the results achieved, and the value of its services.

      <td>Marriott International Inc.  suffered another blow when Arne Sorenson, its chief executive, died from cancer on Monday, but analysts expect the hotel company under new leadership to still manage a gradual recovery from the pandemic’s effect on business.<br />That continuity reflects industry expectations that the next CEO will be chosen from one of two Marriott executives currently leading the company’s day-to-day operations. Mr. Sorenson reduced his responsibilities earlier this month for health reasons.<br />One is Stephanie Linnartz, the group president for consumer operations, technology and emerging businesses. The other is Tony Capuano, group president for global development, design and operations services.<br />Marriott has said the board will select a new chief within two weeks, and one of those two executives is expected to get that role, said a person familiar with the situation.<br />Either of them would be expected to continue a similar strategy for the company, starting with steering it through the remainder of the Covid-19 pandemic, said Carlo Santarelli, analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.</td>

The pandemic turned this process on its head, but it’s not all bad. Networking chats have become easier to set up. When connecting means clicking “join meeting” rather than traveling to a coffee shop, people are much more available. Without the need for a subway ride or a sticky name tag from security, an open half-hour truly is 30 minutes long.<br />The downside is that there is no real opportunity for spontaneous meetings and connections. A virtual conversation with someone working from home has near-zero potential to lead to “hold on a second, I think Jess is in her office. You should meet with her, too.” The organic flow typically associated with building rapport and evaluating company culture is missing.</td>

      <td>How bad energy policy led to rolling blackouts in the freezing Lone Star State.</td>
      <td>Why are millions of Americans in the nation’s most energy-rich state without power and heat for days amid extreme winter weather? “The people who have fallen short with regard to the power are the private power generation companies,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott explained. Ah, yes, blame private power companies . . . that are regulated by government.<br />The Republican sounds like California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who lambasted private utilities for rolling blackouts during a heat wave last summer. Power grids should be able to withstand extreme weather. But in both these bellwether states, state and federal energy policies have created market distortions and reduced grid reliability.<br />Mr. Abbott blamed his state’s extensive power outages on generators freezing early Monday morning, noting “this includes the natural gas & coal generators.” But frigid temperatures and icy conditions have descended on most of the country. Why couldn’t Texas handle them while other states did?<br />The problem is Texas’s overreliance on wind power that has left the grid more vulnerable to bad weather. Half of wind turbines froze last week, causing wind’s share of electricity to plunge to 8% from 42%. Power prices in the wholesale market spiked, and grid regulators on Friday warned of rolling blackouts. Natural gas and coal generators ramped up to cover the supply gap but couldn’t meet the surging demand for electricity—which half of households rely on for heating—even as many families powered up their gas furnaces. Then some gas wells and pipelines froze.<br />In short, there wasn’t sufficient baseload power from coal and nuclear to support the grid. Baseload power is needed to stabilize grid frequency amid changes in demand and supply. When there’s not enough baseload power, the grid gets unbalanced and power sources can fail. The more the grid relies on intermittent renewables like wind and solar, the more baseload power is needed to back them up.</td>

      <td>As states weigh reform, a new project aims to collect best practices.</td>
      <td>Hundreds of bills to reform voting processes have already been introduced in state legislatures this year, but there’s plenty that the laboratories of democracy could learn from one another. To that end, it’s worth watching a new project of the Republican State Leadership Committee.<br />The RSLC, which is the umbrella group for GOP state lawmakers and secretaries of state, is launching a commission on election reform. “We want to find the best practices that are used in every state in the union, and make sure those are available for legislative bodies in the 50 states to consider as options,” says one of the co-chairs, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill. “We have a singular goal, and that is to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat—period.”<br />A call went out for ideas some weeks ago, and state leaders submitted suggested best practices on everything from signature verification to audit procedures to pre-election testing of voting equipment. The new commission’s role, Mr. Merrill says, will be to sort through that stack, and more, to “see how we can determine which ones need to be presented to legislative bodies across the nation.” The aim, he adds, is for the commission to have something substantive to release within weeks.<br />The potential here won’t be lost on anyone who followed the 2020 election mess. To take one example, voters amid the pandemic adopted mail ballots en masse, but some states don’t handle absentee votes until Election Day. Pennsylvania legislators considered allowing preprocessing but disagreed with the Governor on how many days were needed. That’s one small reason the Associated Press didn’t call Pennsylvania for Joe Biden until four days after Nov. 3. State law also lacks clear rules for signature verification, and counties diverged on whether to count undated ballots.<br />For states moving toward absentee voting, Mr. Merrill says, the model should be their peers like Colorado that have gone to mail ballots exclusively. “When you talk about mail-in,” adds the commission’s other co-chair, Michigan state Senator Ruth Johnson, “the devil is in the details, if you want to have that transparency and accountability and integrity. It’s not good or bad, necessarily, but the devil is in the details.”</td>

      <td>Can President Biden’s regulators say no to progressives when they try to bend the law? An early test will come for Mr. Biden’s nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler. Nasdaq is seeking the SEC’s blessing to enforce new diversity mandates for corporate boards. But as Pennsylvania’s Pat Toomey and all 11 other Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee explain in a new letter to the SEC, the quotas run headlong into federal securities law.<br />Every company must have “one director who self-identifies as female,” and one “who self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+,” the stock exchange instructs. Alternatively, the company can publicly “explain why” it “does not have at least two directors on its board who self-identify in the categories listed above”—identifying itself as a Nasdaq pariah.<br />The Senators write that they “commend individual firms for the proactive efforts they have already made in recruiting, promoting, and maintaining diverse talent.” But they go on to say that Nasdaq’s mandates fail “to demonstrate that this proposed rule advances investor protection” or “is otherwise consistent with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.”<br />The diversity mandate conflicts with the law’s command that companies nominate board members who will serve the best interest of shareholders. The Senators observe that “religion, age, political affiliation, geographic location, educational background, veteran’s status, or physical disability” are also measures of board diversity. Yet Nasdaq ignores them in favor of categories that align with elite America’s political mood. That suggests the interests of investors aren’t the priority.<br />The Senators add that the Nasdaq rule also “violates the concept of materiality” in securities law. Materiality focuses disclosure on information that is critical to an investor’s decision. “The materiality doctrine prevents the development of an unstable, politicized securities regime that would be ripe for abuse of power,” they write. Securities law leaves “social policymaking for democratically elected representatives.” Nasdaq wants to make social policy by forcing disclosure of information that “would not help a reasonable investor evaluate a company’s performance.”</td>

He later added: “The Republican Party can never again be respected or strong with political ‘leaders’ like Sen. Mitch McConnell at its helm.”<br />Mr. McConnell joined all but seven Republicans in voting Saturday to acquit Mr. Trump in his impeachment trial, but followed that with a speech that laid blame on the former president for stirring up a crowd, as the two Republicans and their respective allies engage in a broader fight over Mr. Trump’s future role in the party.<br />“They did this because they had been fed wild falsehoods by the most powerful man on Earth—because he was angry he’d lost an election,” Mr. McConnell said. “Former President Trump’s actions preceding the riot were a disgraceful dereliction of duty.”<br />While Mr. McConnell took the position that it was unconstitutional to put a former president on trial, he added: “We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one.”</td>

      <td>Washington should not tolerate foreign actors who wrongfully or unlawfully imprison U.S. citizens.</td>
      <td>As President Biden revamps many aspects of U.S. diplomacy and national security, he should adopt a policy that none of his predecessors had the courage or resolve to: zero tolerance for the unjust detention of Americans abroad. The wrongful detentions of some 40 to 50 U.S. citizens have been publicly reported, but the real number is likely much higher. The State Department in 2019 estimated that around 3,000 Americans are imprisoned abroad, but it has never looked into whether the detentions are just.<br />The U.S. government has increased its focus on freeing unlawfully or wrongfully detained Americans in recent years, but it hasn’t gone far enough. President Obama created an interagency system to assist families and coordinate government response. President Trump went further, securing the release of dozens of Americans from a variety of countries including Egypt, Turkey and Iran, as well as from terrorist groups such as the Taliban.<br />Yet the Trump administration’s efforts were uneven. It failed to secure the release of longtime American hostages such as Siamak and Baquer Namazi in Iran or Austin Tice in Syria. And it went strangely out of its way to assist some Americans whose detentions appeared to be legitimate, such as rapper A$AP Rocky, who was arrested in Sweden after a street fight, and three University of California, Los Angeles basketball players arrested in China for shoplifting.<br />Not every important change has come from the executive branch. Under a new provision, tucked into a law passed in late December, the State Department must review all cases involving U.S. citizens detained abroad and determine, based on 11 criteria, which are unjustly detained. When this determination is made, the case must be referred to the special presidential envoy on hostage affairs to develop and implement a strategy to secure their release. These collective efforts in individual cases will be presented in an annual report to Congress, creating greater visibility and focus on bringing them home.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken is off to a strong start in building on these efforts. At his confirmation hearing, he testified that “doing everything we possibly can to bring any American home who is being unjustly detained anywhere in the world or is a hostage” is a priority. This was an important warning to governments that wrongfully detain U.S. citizens.</td>

      <td>In my small Missouri town, we’re awaiting an exodus from the beleaguered cities.</td>
      <td>Tarkio, Mo.<br />I’ve read at least a dozen articles predicting a movement away from cities toward the hinterlands as urbanites flee crime, congestion and Covid for a simpler life. Remote work is the wave of the future, and we’ll all be doing our Zoom conferences from somewhere else. Manhattan and Silicon Valley will look like mining ghost towns, places where the mother lode has been exhausted. Even though Miami and Austin, Texas, seem to be the preferred destinations for the techno-refugees, U-Haul reports that Missouri is the seventh leading destination for people using its services.<br />In my northwestern Missouri town of some 1,500 people, we’re not exactly bracing for a population boom. Sure, we’ve got internet, I’ve done dozens of remote meetings in the past year, and I’m sure that some of the locals have discovered the joys of Robinhood, but young urban professionals are much likelier to leave New York or San Jose for Boise, Idaho, or the Hill Country of Texas. Tarkio isn’t on their menu.<br />That’s a shame. Tarkio has been declining since about 1900, but it’s not that bad. We’re close to the interstate, and the flooding along the Missouri is always at least 7 miles away. Riots are nonexistent, at least so far, but so is street life. Which has its advantages. You don’t need a bike lane when small animals can live out their life spans in the middle of Spruce Street, where I live, without being disturbed by traffic.<br />The biggest scandal in town is that this summer we had a rash of people blowing grass clippings into the streets. This, I gather from social-media posts, is dangerous to motorcycles. I’ve only ever seen one two-wheeled vehicle drive by my house. Billy, the local biker, has a bandanna, a T-shirt, a mullet and a motor scooter that tops out at about 30 miles an hour. He’s not exactly the Hell’s Angels, but if keeping grass out of the streets helps Bill, I’m in.</td>

      <td>Inventing words was once thought pretentious. Now it is considered an achievement, though it may still induce ‘coiner’s remorse.’</td>
      <td>The children’s author Theodor Geisel, otherwise known as Dr. Seuss, was often asked where he drew inspiration for his verbal inventiveness. Surely there had to be some enchanted source for the words he dreamed up—the ones that caught on, notably “grinch,” and the ones that might pleasingly have done so, such as “punkerish” and “flubbulous.” He would solemnly reply that in August each year he traveled to have his cuckoo clock serviced in a tiny Alpine village called Uber Gletch. “I wander around and talk to people in the streets,” he explained. “They are very strange people, and I get my ideas from them.”<br />Dr. Seuss is one of the heroes of “The Hidden History of Coined Words,” in which Ralph Keyes—the author of more than a dozen books, including “Euphemania” and “I Love It When You Talk Retro”—explores the byways of etymology. But, as this eloquent and instructive survey shows, the stories behind coinages are seldom so zany or romantic. Mr. Keyes makes clear how hard it is to create a word and get other people to adopt it—even if it has the virtues of brevity, vividness, a playful air and a memorable sound. Although new nouns, verbs and adjectives are forever coming into being, most make no impression. Some sparkle for a while, then fade from view. Only a few succeed, and they are “as likely to be created by chance as by intention.”<br />The first person to refer to “coining” words seems to have been George Puttenham, a 16th-century English courtier. Although quite a coiner himself—“insect,” “predatory,” “indecency”—he was ambivalent about the habit. For many of his contemporaries, new words were as unwelcome as bad smells, and 300 years after Puttenham complained about semi-educated students getting snared in new-fangled verbiage, it was still common to think that coining words was shamefully pretentious. Mark Twain was at pains to tell a correspondent that he’d never done it, though he conceded that he might have called attention to a few previously obscure terms. Theodore Roosevelt was relieved to think he bore no responsibility for any coinage. This from the man who minted “bully pulpit” and “lunatic fringe.”<br />Today it’s a different story. We prize the ability to give a phenomenon a catchy handle, and people’s coinages are regarded as part of their legacy. Take the New York Times obituaries of psychologists George Weinberg and Herbert Freudenberger, which even in their headlines identify the deceased as the coiners of important words: “homophobia” and “burnout,” respectively. But in many cases the person who takes credit for a word—or is awarded credit—isn’t the first to have used it. The term “emotional intelligence” wasn’t invented by Daniel Goleman, whose first book on the topic was so popular in the mid-1990s, and “tipping point” predates Malcolm Gladwell’s bestseller of a few years later.<br />Mr. Keyes admires several writers whose originative powers seem beyond dispute. One is the poet John Milton, who gave us “jubilant,” “depravity,” “echoing” and “fragrance.” Another is Milton’s contemporary Sir Thomas Browne, who came up with “suicide,” “ferocious” and “misconception.” But the abiding impression of Mr. Keyes’s account is that a coinage is a happy accident, often the result of a prank or a moment of whimsy—and that in most cases the person behind it will have left no other mark on the language.</td>

These manipulators will never be found. But shut up about that too.<br />Folks in the Northeast accustomed to weeklong outages may be surprised when Texans mostly have their power back in hours. Hundreds of downed power lines aren’t the problem as they are elsewhere. Texas winter blackouts come wholesale when generating plants trip offline due to conditions that will quickly be remedied when temperatures return to the 50s and 60s this weekend.<br />In fact, Texas has plenty of generation to keep its system from cracking even under summer air-conditioning demand, and more than enough in principle for a winter cold snap. Texas’ grid operator pledged to get to the bottom of why 34,000 megawatts nevertheless dropped offline, but we already know the answer because the same thing happened in 2011 and 1989.</td>

      <td>If the filibuster is a ‘Jim Crow relic,’ so is a policy designed to curtail the abundance of black labor.</td>
      <td>Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week that the House version of the next coronavirus aid package will include a $15 federal minimum wage, adding that “27 million people will get a raise, 70% of them women.”<br />In truth, Mrs. Pelosi has no idea how many people would see a raise because she doesn’t know how many people would keep their jobs. Employers may decide that they can’t afford to pay someone a $15 hourly wage, so workers could be let go or offered fewer hours as a result. A new Congressional Budget Office report estimates that 1.4 million jobs would vanish, and no one knows how many people would never be hired in the first place because they’ve been priced out of the labor force. Politicians gloss over these trade-offs, but they are basic economic facts of life.<br />Mrs. Pelosi’s reference to female workers is also misleading. Democrats have long held up single working moms as the typical minimum-wage earner, but that’s a myth. A 2014 analysis by economists Joseph Sabia and Richard Burkhauser found that the vast majority of workers who would benefit from a minimum-wage increase live in nonpoor households. According to Mr. Sabia, “only 13 percent of workers who would be affected live in poor households, while nearly two-thirds live in households with incomes over twice the poverty line, and over 40 percent live in households with incomes over three times the poverty line.”<br />Such findings would seem to underscore the limits of using minimum-wage laws to address poverty. Most workers who earn minimum wages are not a family’s sole breadwinner. They tend to be teenagers living at home or senior citizens working part-time to stay busy in retirement. According to Mr. Sabia, single mothers made up less than 5% of those who potentially would benefit from a minimum-wage hike.<br />What Democrats play down is that most minimum-wage earners aren’t impoverished, and most people who qualify as poor already earn more than the minimum. Poor families need jobs more than they need raises. And what teens and young adults most need are opportunities to accumulate job experience that can lead to higher pay and upward social mobility down the road. By reducing employment opportunities, minimum-wage laws can make inequality worse.</td>

      <td>Federal court dismisses appeal brought by unions for police, firefighters and corrections officers to block the disclosure</td>
      <td>Federal appeals-court judges on Tuesday ruled that police disciplinary records in New York City may be made public, dismissing an appeal brought by unions for police, firefighters and corrections officers to block the disclosure of the information.<br />The Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals’ ruling affirmed a Manhattan federal judge’s previous decision that the disciplinary records should be made public. It also lifted a stay from September that prevented the publication of the records.<br />A coalition of unions sued New York City in July seeking to block the release of officers’ disciplinary records in cases where claims against them are unsubstantiated, arguing that the publication of the records would harm the officers. A three-judge panel found that argument lacked merit.<br />New York public-safety agencies—including the New York Police Department—have long cited Section 50-a of the state’s Civil Rights law in decisions to keep secret the disciplinary files of officers. The statute said personnel records used to evaluate the performance of a public safety officer are deemed confidential and cannot be exposed without a court order or the written consent of the employee.<br />State lawmakers in June voted to repeal the law as part of a series of changes to policing that followed nationwide protests inspired by the May 25 killing of George Floyd. Mr. Floyd, a Black man, was killed in police custody in Minneapolis. Soon after the law was repealed, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, announced plans to create a public online repository of NYPD records. Subsequently, the unions brought their suit.</td>

This column, originally published Sept. 20, 2020, contains smartphone tips for people enduring outages, as well as advice to prepare for such adversities.<br />As an inferno sweeps the West and hurricanes spin over the Atlantic, power outages pose a big risk for those living in affected areas. Recently, in California, the utility  PG&E  pre-emptively shut off power to prevent the spread of wildfire, leaving hundreds of thousands of customers in the dark.<br />No matter where you live, it’s good to prepare for a blackout before it’s too late.

Here’s how to get your other lifeline—your smartphone and connected devices—ready and powered up in case of an emergency.<br />Turn on emergency alerts. Wireless Emergency Alerts, or WEA, are messages that can be sent by local and federal authorities, including the National Weather Service and Federal Emergency Management Agency, directly to smartphones over cellular networks. Most devices released after 2012 are able to receive the alerts.<br />If you’ve ever experienced a sudden, blaring tone or buzz accompanied by a grim message—an alert for a missing person perhaps—that’s a WEA.</td>

      <td>Nico Muhly’s two-person opera inspired by the true story of Joyce Mitchell, a prison tailor who helped two inmates escape; a SOLO performance by John Holiday of an 1887 temperance poem set to music by Tyshawn Sorey.</td>
      <td><br />The pandemic shutdown has pushed opera companies to commission new works designed to be viewed on computer screens. Catapult Opera, founded by the conductor Neal Goren (formerly head of the now-defunct Gotham Chamber Opera), had planned to present its first-ever season live in 2020-21. Foiled by Covid-19, the company instead launched a digital commissioning program. The first result is “The Glitch,” a 22-minute, two-character opera by composer Nico Muhly and librettist Greg Pierce. As filmed by director Marcus Shields, performed by baritone Lester Lynch and soprano Krysty Swann, and conducted by Mr. Goren, the piece powerfully demonstrates how the small screen can make opera—often the grandest of art forms—truly intimate.<br />The characters are based on real people: Joyce “Tilly” Mitchell and her husband, Lyle. In 2015, Tilly, a civilian employee who worked in the tailor shop of a prison, helped two inmates escape by providing prison contraband. She had agreed to accompany them once the men broke out, and part of the scheme involved killing her husband. But at the last minute, she did not join the convicts on the run and Lyle was not murdered. The opera imagines Tilly’s conversation with her husband after she has confessed and gone to prison herself. (Readers might remember the story from the television series “Escape at Dannemora,” which dramatized the tale.)<br />Mr. Pierce’s trenchant libretto drills deep into the couple’s questions for each other and themselves, their motives and their bond. “How could you? Who are you?” Lyle asks. Tilly’s response, a romantic fantasy about the prisoner Richie and a dream of escape from everyday life, turns darker with her realization that Richie, a convicted murderer, might well have abandoned or killed her while they were on the lam. Lyle answers her erotic taunting with an invented dalliance of his own that Tilly knows almost instantly is a lie. And even though Tilly suggests that killing Lyle (whom the conspirators called the “glitch” in the plan) was her idea, not Richie’s, and that she wants to be rid of him even now, he insists that he will stand by her.<br />“The Glitch” delves so skillfully into the immediate emotional reality of these two people that you don’t even need to know the background. Mr. Muhly’s lyrical vocal settings and atmospheric piano accompaniment performed by Adam Tendler feel like natural expressions of emotion, be they rapturous imaginings or angry confusion. The singers are filmed with darkness around them, as if they are alone in the void with their feelings and each other; Mr. Shields astutely often shows the reacting partner instead of the singing one, so we hear the words and see their effect. The intensity of the voices—Mr. Lynch’s opulent baritone and Ms. Swann’s wiry mezzo—and both singers’ remarkable ability to act with their faces are such that their performances never seem oversized or artificial on the small screen. Instead, we are drawn into their worlds. The real power of opera is less in its grandeur than in its ability to express the otherwise inexpressible; “The Glitch” does that with extraordinary grace.</td>

      <td>The 25-year-old singer-songwriter confronts her struggle with substance abuse on an album that embraces melody.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />The first sound we hear on “Hardline”—the opening track from “Little Oblivions” (Matador), the new album by 25-year-old Julien Baker—is a heavy chord from an organ that brings to mind the sanctity of church but also, with its woolly distortion, distress. In the context of Ms. Baker’s oeuvre, this sound alone marks a major shift.<br />Her first album, 2015’s “Sprained Ankle,” a collection of shadowy folk numbers, almost exclusively featured her voice, acoustic guitar, and a bit of piano. On 2017’s acclaimed follow-up, “Turn Out the Lights,” she plugged her instrument into an amp and added touches of strings and woodwinds, but the record was drum-free and still spare in the extreme. Yet that organ chord on “Hardline” and the percussion that enters shortly after suggest that we’re in for a different kind of experience on album number three, one where instrumental color and sharper melodies share the load with Ms. Baker’s dark lyrics and expressive singing.</td>

      <td>New gun-control legislation could allow cities to ban handguns</td>
      <td>Canada is introducing new gun-control legislation that would make it possible for individual cities to ban handguns at a local level and says it will create a buyback program for military-style semiautomatic weapons that were banned from use by the country’s Liberal government last year.<br />The planned legislation will also create new offenses for altering a magazine to allow more shots to be fired without reloading, and develop a system that would allow concerned friends or family members to apply to a court and request the immediate, temporary removal of an individual’s firearms.<br />The planned measures come nearly a year after Canada prohibited the use of more than 1,500 models of military-style semiautomatic weapons, including the AR-15. AR-15 style rifles have been used in some of the deadliest U.S. mass shootings, including attacks at a concert in Las Vegas in 2017 and a high school in Parkland, Fla., in 2018.<br />The Canadian government said it plans to introduce a buyback program for the banned firearms in the coming months, and will make it illegal to transfer, sell or bequeath the weapons outside of that program.<br />The government said its buyback program will be voluntary. That means someone who decides not to turn in a banned military-style semiautomatic weapon can still store it as a collectors’ item but must abide by rules governing its storage and can never transfer or legally use the firearm.</td>

      <td>In a Netflix series based on the Sarah Pinborough novel, coincidences lead a single mom to become entangled with a psychiatrist and his troubled wife.</td>
      <td>There’s no such thing as coincidence, people say, but those people have not seen “Behind Her Eyes,” which presents several whoppers of happenstance before it’s even warmed up. As readers of the Sarah Pinborough novel know—and unsuspecting customers will find out—mere terrestrial phenomena of time and place can’t hold a votive candle to the otherworldly avenues the storyline will follow, into what will no doubt be dead ends of epic eye-rolling and consumer consternation.<br />All of which is odd, because the six-part series, created by Steve Lightfoot, does what it does very well, as long as it remains rooted in the human. Louise (Simona Brown) and David (Tom Bateman) literally run into each other inside a London pub, requiring Louise to compensate for the drink spilled on David. He will thereafter smooch Louise when they’re saying good night on the sidewalk. She’s not entirely unreceptive, but he’s apologetic and flees into the night. And wouldn’t you know it? The next day, David turns out to be the new psychiatrist at the medical practice where Louise works as a secretary.<br />“What’re the odds?” Louise will say, to which a viewer might respond “You tell me.”<br />The divorced Louise has a son, Adam (Tyler Howitt), who is adorable; the married David has a wife, Adele (Eve Hewson), who is disturbed. How and why are the mysteries that propel the first couple of episodes. She seems to be a doting spouse. “They’re lucky to have you,” Adele says, as her husband leaves for his first day on the new job. “Like me.” He cringes. When she assures him that “I’ll be here” when he gets home that night, it sounds like a threat. Generally speaking, sex scenes are, all titillation aside, fairly useless. They tell you nothing about characters or motivations. But thanks to Norwegian filmmaker Erik Richter Strand, who directed this entire U.K.-based series, the one between Adele and David says almost everything about their relationship that needs to be said. It’s eloquent, as is one that comes later in the show, and contains all the joy the first one lacks.<br />There are tantalizing bread crumbs of psychological innuendo strewn all over the path from Scotland, where we meet a much younger Adele, to London, where she and David have only recently moved. They’ve had to relocate frequently over the intervening 10 years, it seems, and the reasons will become more and more evident after Louise, walking down the street, literally knocks Adele over. They’ve not previously met, but soon discover they have David in common. The chance encounters just keep coming.</td>

      <td>Jennifer Harrington’s smart horror film skewers social-media influencers—literally.</td>
      <td>That the horror platform Shudder is presenting “Shook” is appropriate enough: The streaming service is a virtual catalog of frightful content, and Jennifer Harrington’s feature is a connoisseur’s movie. An update on the slasher film, it takes the plot devices common to the classics of the form—the ultraviolence, the simple morality, the deserving victims, the emotionally tortured villains—and tweaks them into today. Most significantly, and humorously, Ms. Harrington uses social media the way “Halloween,” “Scream” and “When a Stranger Calls” used the land-line telephone—as a weaponized instrument of torment.<br />That director Harrington makes social-media influencers the victims of her mayhem—but not before making them ridiculous—is a guilty pleasure, and meant to be. When we first see Mia (Daisye Tutor) and her fellow stars of online marketing, they are being photographed at what appears to be a red-carpet event. Lights are flashing. Mics are waving. Enthusiastic crowd noise is percolating. Then the camera pulls back and we see the truth—the young women and their camera crew are inside an otherwise abandoned warehouse, with prerecorded sound pumped in and no one around but them. Which is spooky: On the loose in their Southern California community is a serial murderer of small dogs. Yes, dogs. But before the evening is over, said killer will have graduated to people, with one of the influencers impaled on her own stiletto heel.<br />It has to be said that several of Ms. Harrington’s forays into physical violence (she co-wrote the story with Alesia Glidewell) will make one wince, flinch and/or recoil. But such cringe-inducing content is hardly foreign territory within the genre being deconstructed. Nor are ambivalent characters. Mia, for instance, is a classically conflicted heroine/victim: Her late mother, who died of the hereditary “Livingston’s disease,” was cared for solely by Mia’s sister, Nicole (a terrific and funny Emily Goss), who asked Mia for help and was rebuffed. Needing to travel for her own medical care, Nicole asks Mia to babysit her dog, and for the first time Mia agrees to do it—but only because it’s good for her brand, given the ongoing dog murders. (No dogs are actually harmed in the making of this movie, but there are crime-scene photos…) Once she’s alone at Nicole’s, with the dog, Mia is besieged by threatening calls, from someone who at times seems to be inside the house.<br />One of Ms. Harrington’s ingenious moves is the demonization of the smart home, and the possible repercussions of living one’s life online. “How do you know Jade?” Mia asks her mystery caller, when he refers to one of her friends. How would he not know Jade? Everything about Mia’s life is available on the web, or courtesy of Alexa (renamed Diana here, after Nicole and Mia’s mother). Nicole’s house is set up with surveillance cameras (because of her invalid mom); Mia’s life is one long live feed. Her every thought becomes a text. The horror isn’t just about what’s going to happen to her, but the life she leads. At least for the time being.<br />“Shook” has the requisite twists to make it much more than a straightforward horror-shocker, and the sharp turns are sufficient to have viewers profoundly dizzy about where it’s all going to go. They may also wonder, as I did, why imperiled dogs are more nervous-making than imperiled people. But that’s part of Ms. Harrington’s commentary on a genre in which people are disposable and pets make you worry.</td>

      <td>The NAACP, on behalf of Rep. Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against former President Donald Trump and his former personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, accusing them of conspiring to incite the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />The lawsuit also names two right-wing groups, Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, as defendants. Some members of each group have been arrested in connection with the attack, which left five people, including one police officer, dead.<br />The lawsuit, filed in Washington alleges that Messrs. Trump and Giuliani and members of the two groups conspired to prevent Congress from fulfilling its official duties to certify election results—which they allege violates the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act. That law, which targeted unrest after the Civil War, allows suits seeking compensation for civil-rights violations.<br />Lawmakers were in the process of certifying President Biden’s electoral victories on Jan. 6 when the rioters swarmed the Capitol, halting the process for hours. Lawmakers and aides were rushed out of the House and Senate chambers, huddling in office buildings and, in some cases, hiding for hours until law enforcement was able to end the riot. Videos played during the impeachment trial showed the mob coming close to finding aides hiding in the Capitol.<br />“January 6th was one of the most shameful days in our country’s history, and it was instigated by the President himself. His gleeful support of violent white supremacists led to a breach of the Capitol that put my life, and that of my colleagues, in grave danger,” Mr. Thompson said in a statement.</td>

      <td>Iraqi and American officials aim to figure out how militants struck a heavily guarded air base used by U.S. in its campaign against Islamic State</td>
      <td>Iraqi and U.S. officials deepened an investigation Tuesday into a deadly rocket attack on a U.S. military base in Iraqi Kurdistan, as they sought to establish how militants managed to strike one of the country’s most heavily guarded facilities.<br />The U.S.-led military coalition in the region said approximately 14 rockets were fired toward the city of Erbil on Monday, with three hitting the key air base used by the U.S. military in its campaign against Islamic State. A civilian U.S. contractor who was a Filipino national was killed and nine others were injured.<br />At least three other people were injured outside of the base, according to Iraqi officials. Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s self-governing Kurdish region, has long been an enclave of calm in a region still recovering from years of war.<br />The air base is located within a high-security complex that also includes Erbil’s civilian international airport. The airport is protected by multiple layers of security and managed to keep operating even when Islamic State forces came within mere miles of the city in 2014.<br />President Biden was briefed on the attack, a White House spokesman said Monday night, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Kurdistan Regional Government Prime Minister Masrour Barzani and Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi to discuss the attack, according to officials from both countries.</td>

      <td>Palantir Technologies Inc.  shares dropped sharply Tuesday after the data-mining company laid out its expectations for revenue growth over the next few years and said it would beef up its sales force.<br />Palantir has joined a cohort of firms whose market debuts have been welcomed by many investors, some of whom are looking for technology-driven companies to grow rapidly to justify their valuations. The Denver-based company, which provides software focused on helping businesses as well as defense and intelligence agencies analyze data, saw its shares rise from a $10 debut in a direct listing in September to as high as $39 in late January, according to FactSet.<br />The stock has fallen since then and traded down about 12% to $28.05 Tuesday afternoon, as executives said they expect Palantir to generate revenue growth of more than 30% annually over the next five years. That rate could potentially be slower than the 47% gain it recorded for 2020 compared with 2019.<br />The company isn’t “focused on the day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, near-term focus that, quite frankly, destroys businesses,” said Chief Executive Officer Alexander Karp. “It’s one of the main reasons why so many of our businesses, especially in tech, are actually only serving Wall Street and not serving their clients,” he added.<br />Palantir plans to expand its sales team by triple-digit levels this year, operations chief Shyam Sankar told investors Tuesday.</td>

      <td>Exposure and frozen pipes threaten cattle; dairy farmers are forced to dump milk after plant shutdowns</td>
      <td>Bitter cold and power outages have created a crisis for some Texan farms and ranches, leaving livestock dead from exposure and raising fears that herds could run short of food and water.<br />Forced shutdowns of plants that process milk and make animal feed are disrupting the state’s agricultural supply chains, industry executives said. Some farmers are being forced to dump tankers of milk on fields because it can’t be processed, and state agriculture officials feared livestock may have to be euthanized if they cannot be watered and fed.<br />“No feed, no water, and no heat doesn’t make for a good situation,” said Sid Miller, Texas agriculture commissioner. Mr. Miller on Tuesday said he was urging state utilities to restore electricity to rural areas—some of which he said had gone without power for more than 30 hours straight—while fielding calls from cattlemen losing calves to the cold and poultry farmers struggling with frozen water pipes.<br />A rare winter storm over the weekend and record-low temperatures in some parts of Texas caused power demand in the state to outpace supply, as thermostats were cranked up. At the same time, freezing temperatures forced some natural-gas and coal-fired power plants offline, while wind turbines in West Texas froze and snow blanketed banks of solar panels. Texas power officials called for rotating outages to manage the shortfall, but in some parts of the state those measures have led to extended stretches without power.<br />The situation has turned into chaos for some producers in one of the country’s most livestock- and poultry-heavy states. Texas in December counted about 2.9 million cattle on feedlots, the most in the nation, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The state’s dairies house the country’s fifth-largest dairy herd with about 613,000 milking cows, and Texas is the sixth-biggest chicken producer, raising about 675 million birds for slaughter in 2019, according to the latest USDA figures.</td>

      <td>Aurora Flores hadn’t gone out much during the pandemic. But recently she forced herself to take a walk in New York’s Central Park to clear her mind and seek solace in the sound of birds and a waterfall. As she was strolling down the path, another woman approached, wearing a mask. Letting out a loud yelp, the woman flung a handful of birdseed in the air.<br />Suddenly, a flurry of titmice, cardinals, blue jays and robins appeared, as Ms. Flores stood there amazed. The stranger offered her some seeds, and Ms. Flores poured some on her gloved hand, holding it out in front of her. One by one, the birds began to land on her fingers.<br />“I was elated. I felt blessed,” says Ms. Flores, 67, a writer. “She saw me beaming, and I could tell she smiled. Then she went on her way.” Now, Ms. Flores says she is motivated to go outside almost every day.<br />Strangers can soothe and support us when no one else is around, or boost our mood with a smile or a laugh. They can distract us from the chatter in our own head and help expand our perspective. They can make us feel connected and remind us we are not alone.<br />Yet we’re missing out on many of these serendipitous moments during the pandemic. Social distancing, working from home and the disruption of normal activities have reduced our opportunities for casual exchanges with people we don’t know, or with whom we have only loose ties. Yet, if we work at it, it’s possible to generate those moments even now—and psychologists say we should.</td>

With backing from two-thirds of people under 56 years old, a majority of American adults say the government should actually annul all student debt. Even boomers, who by a slight majority oppose voiding any student loans, overwhelmingly want the government to insert itself into the marketplace and impose price controls on the cost of higher education.</td>

      <td>Regarding Sadanand Dhume’s “Rihanna Rallies to the Wrong Cause in India” (East Is East, Feb. 5): Greta Thunberg and Meena Harris would condemn India to feudal agrarianism if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi were to heed their calls and rescind his historic agriculture deregulation. Half of India’s workers toil as serfs in low productivity, undignified subsistence farming with the sector accounting for a paltry 15% of the economy. Compared with the average American farm plot of 440 acres, 86% of Indian agriculture holdings are less than five acres and are too marginal to ever achieve economies of scale. Indian crop yields consequently are half of those of the U.S. Due to rapacious government-backed wholesale cartels, the markup between prices remunerated to farmers and what consumers pay is 65% in India compared with 10% in other nations. Forty percent of India’s fruits and vegetables rot before reaching the marketplace because of anachronistic antihoarding laws that deter investment in refrigeration.<br />Mr. Modi’s audacious market reforms are vital for weaving together his country’s 4,000 fragmented agriculture markets into a national whole. McKinsey & Co. estimates that a robust decontrol of farming could raise cultivation output by $175 billion, doubling farmers’ incomes over eight years. Untangling farmers and supply chains from a morass of red tape, grain-storage limits and monopolistic middlemen—coupled with more private investment—is an eminently sensible policy regime, unlike the usual nostrums of bailouts and farm-loan waivers peddled by past Indian governments. Prime Minister Modi deserves accolades for launching the opening salvo against the agriculture license raj.<br />Nathan Punwani<br />Los Angeles</td>

He ponders whether this “trend” is real—but Mr. Riley needn’t look far for clarity.<br />That very same Times piece includes a poll from EdNext that found parents’ opinions of teachers’ unions have become more favorable during the pandemic. It also cites a poll from EdChoice that found that two-thirds of parents felt teachers unions had a “helpful” impact on student learning. Mr. Riley could have also noted a poll released last week from HuffPost/YouGov that showed far more parents of children in K-12 schools approve of how unions are handling the pandemic than disapprove.<br />The truth is no one knows better than teachers the limitations and deficiencies of remote learning. And no one has worked harder than teachers to secure the resources to safely reopen buildings. While charter schools remain closed, traditional public schools—in New York, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco—are reopening with protocols in place to mitigate virus transmission. This isn’t a binary choice: both in-school learning and safety are important. But rather than solve problems, Mr. Riley would prefer to embark on a fresh round of teacher bashing that has fallen out of favor with politicians and the public at large.<br />Randi Weingarten<br />President</td>

      <td>For decades, Iran has built and operated a network of loyal armed groups around the Middle East that seek to expand Tehran’s military footprint and gain political influence in the region.<br />These groups often operate under the direction of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Founded after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the Revolutionary Guard seeks to defend the Iranian state and advance the model of Shiite Islam that underpinned the revolution.<br />This network of militias was long overseen by Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian commander of the Guards’ foreign wing, the Quds Force, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in January 2020. In recent years, Washington has accused several Iran-backed militias of killing American service members and has designated some as terrorist organizations.<br />In the wake of Gen. Soleimani’s death, new groups have emerged in Iraq, claiming responsibility for attacks targeting American interests. Not much is known about these groups, but many are believed to be splinters of bigger, long-established factions using new names in an attempt to shield their identity.<br />On Monday, a little-known Shiite militia group named the Guardians of the Blood Brigade claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on the U.S.-led coalition in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan, that killed a contractor and injured several others, including a U.S. service member.

      <td>The proposed legislation heads to the French Senate amid criticism that it stigmatizes Muslims</td>
      <td>PARIS—France’s National Assembly approved a bill Tuesday that aims to strengthen government oversight of mosques and religious schools and crack down on other practices—from online hate speech to forced marriage—that President Emmanuel Macron says are rooted in Islamist separatism.<br />The proposed legislation passed the National Assembly, or lower house of Parliament, with a vote of 347-151, garnering support from lawmakers in Mr. Macron’s ranks as well as other centrist parties. It now heads to the Senate.<br />Mr. Macron and his supporters in Parliament have framed the bill as a response to the spread of “Islamist separatism,” which the president describes as an ideology that aims to build a parallel society in France where religious rules override civil laws. That ideology, the Macron government says, undermines the values of the French Republic—liberty, equality and fraternity—as well as laïcité, France’s strict separation of religion and state.<br />The proposed legislation requires religious associations and mosques to declare foreign funding of more than €10,000 ($12,000), and to sign a pledge to respect France’s republican values to receive state subsidies. The bill would also make it easier for the government to shut down mosques, associations and schools that are found criticizing republican values.<br />The proposed legislation would make it a criminal offense for anyone, in the name of ideology or religious extremism, to put pressure on civil servants and public-service providers to deviate from France’s secular values. Under its provisions, a man who refuses to allow a male doctor to examine his wife could face up to five years in jail and a fine of up to €75,000.</td>

      <td>Renewable energy and market design are easy targets during electricity failures but they are inadequate explanations</td>
      <td>Rolling blackouts in Texas during a historic winter storm are inviting scrutiny of everything from the grid’s reliance on wind energy to laissez-faire market design. The answer is actually quite simple: Texas isn’t used to the cold.<br />Just as observers blamed high solar penetration for California’s electricity blackouts last year, Texas’s bounty of wind power has been an easy target. Yet Texas counts on wind to meet only 10% of its winter capacity, according to the state’s  grid manager. Natural gas and coal make up the lion’s share, comprising 82%. Sure, some wind turbines glitched under cold weather conditions, but so did natural gas- and coal-fired power. That is partly because water intake facilities froze for these generators, just as they did in the last extreme winter seen in February 2011. At least some natural gas had to be redirected for heating rather than power, adding to the supply shortage.<br />Another point of criticism is market design. While other regional markets are designed to reward power plants for being on standby in case of unexpected demand peaks, Texas’s approach is fairly market-driven. That has meant the state historically has had a smaller cushion of electricity when demand has peaked, but this is no longer a problem.<br />Reserve margins—excess electricity generation capacity over demand—were dangerously low in 2018 and 2019 but bounced to 10.6% in 2020 and are expected to hit 15.5% in 2021. They clearly aren’t to blame in this winter storm’s failure: Winter peak demand hit a record 69,150 megawatts over the weekend, but up to 34,000 megawatts of supply were taken offline. Texas had no problem meeting a higher summer peak demand, which was 7% higher last year than this winter event.<br />Solutions will have to be nuanced and incremental. Winterizing all power plants would be unnecessarily expensive, and so would a complete overhaul of Texas’s market design, which is partly responsible for consistently low power prices compared with the rest of the country.</td>

      <td>Democrats want to impose federal rules on elections for president. Congress doesn’t have that power.</td>
      <td>House Democrats have made election “reform” their top legislative priority. House Resolution 1, styled the For the People Act, would vitiate existing state election laws, federalize the rules of congressional and presidential elections, and effectively do the same for state elections, which are often conducted on the same ballot. Critics have noted that the proposed rules are designed to benefit Democrats. They’re also unconstitutional.<br />The key problem is that the Constitution doesn’t give Congress the authority to regulate all federal elections in the same way. Congress has significant power over congressional elections. The Elections Clause of Article I, Section 4 provides that state legislatures “shall prescribe” the “times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,” but also authorizes Congress to “make or alter such regulations.”<br />Yet Congress has only limited authority over the conduct of presidential elections. They are governed by the Electors Clause in Article II, Section 1, which provides: “Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the United States.” Congress’s timing determination is binding on the states, as the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held last year in Carson v. Simon, which rejected Minnesota’s modification of its ballot-receipt deadline. (The Honest Elections Project sponsored the litigation, and Mr. Rivkin was the plaintiffs’ lead attorney.)<br />But the Electors Clause gives state legislatures plenary power over the manner of selecting presidential electors. It does not permit lawmakers to promulgate a comprehensive federal elections code. Nor does the 15th Amendment, which bars racial discrimination in voting, or the other amendments extending the franchise. Each grants Congress the power to enforce its guarantees through “appropriate legislation.” But as the Supreme Court explained in City of Boerne v. Flores (1997), “Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is.” None of these amendments guarantee the right to vote in any particular way—such as by mail versus in person—so Congress can’t rightly be said to be enforcing them through H.R.1. And none of them repeal the Electors Clause.<br />Although all 50 state legislatures have provided for popular election of presidential electors, the legislatures could change state law and appoint electors directly. H.R.1 violates the Electors Clause on its face, purporting to govern not merely the time, place and manner of congressional elections, but also regulating presidential elections in exactly the same prescriptive matter as congressional elections.</td>

      <td>The world is watching how he responds to an attack on U.S. forces.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden has said his Presidency won’t be a third Obama term, and he’ll have plenty of opportunities to prove it. The latest comes after a rocket attack against the U.S.-led coalition in Erbil, Iraq.<br />“Initial reports indicate that the attacks killed one civilian contractor and injured several members of the Coalition, including one American service member and several American contractors,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday. He added that he had told the leader of Kurdistan’s regional government that Washington would help “to investigate and hold accountable those responsible.” America’s adversaries will be watching, especially in Tehran.<br />An investigation is under way, but it’s hard to believe a Shiite militia allied with Iran isn’t behind the attack. The group Awliya Al Dam, or Guardians of Blood, has claimed responsibility. U.S. and Iraqi officials say smaller organizations like this have been linked to better known Iranian proxies such as Kataib Hezbollah. SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks extremist groups’ online activity, reports that Awliya Al Dam has vowed more violence after the latest incident.<br />Iranian proxies launched several rocket attacks on U.S. and allied forces in 2019 and 2020. Their goal is to drive out the roughly 2,500 U.S. troops that assist the Iraqi military, provide intelligence against a return of Islamic State, and limit malign Iranian influence in the country. Retaliatory strikes won’t put a complete stop to such aggression, but the right retaliation can degrade the militias’ abilities. Inaction could invite more brazen attacks.<br />Before Donald Trump ordered the retaliatory attack on Iranian terror chief Qasem Soleimani in January 2020, many warned such a response would lead to a full-scale war. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei tweeted that Mr. Trump “can’t do anything.” Mr. Biden doesn’t need to escalate to Mr. Trump’s level, but it’s worth reminding Tehran that he isn’t Barack Obama—and the U.S. can do something.</td>

      <td>The rank and file don’t see him as a liability, and his supporters are dug in.</td>
      <td>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a stinging speech immediately after President Trump was acquitted in his Senate trial over the weekend. The speech has been seen as the opening salvo in Mr. McConnell’s effort to marginalize Mr. Trump’s influence in the Republican Party. It will be an uphill battle.<br />A Quinnipiac survey released on Monday found that only 11% of Republicans held Mr. Trump responsible for inciting the violence on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6. A mere 9% supported conviction. Only 16% would support even the symbolic rebuke of a censure motion. Not only do 87% of Republicans believe Mr. Trump should be allowed to hold office again; 75% want him to play a “prominent role” in the Republican Party.<br />What does such a role entail? A recent Gallup survey found that 68% of Republicans want the former president to remain their party’s leader. According to an Axios-Ipsos poll, 66% of Republicans believe that their party is better with Mr. Trump in it, and 57% favor him as their party’s 2024 presidential candidate. These sentiments may change over time. But for now, efforts to weaken Mr. Trump’s influence within the party will not succeed.<br />If anything, the opposite seems more likely. State and county Republican Party organizations across the country are censuring elected officials who broke with Mr. Trump to support his impeachment in the House and conviction in the Senate. The Trump base has anathematized even Trump loyalists such as former Vice President Mike Pence, who honored their oath of office. These supporters will not countenance anything short of unswerving fealty to Mr. Trump.<br />No doubt there are differences within the Republican Party between Trump supporters and party regulars. According to NBC, 87% of Trump supporters have “very positive” views of the former president, a sentiment shared by only 44% of party regulars.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration extended a federal moratorium on home foreclosures for another three months and expanded assistance for people behind on their mortgage payments during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The White House said Tuesday that it would extend a ban on home foreclosures for federally backed mortgages through June 30. President Biden had earlier extended the moratorium, which had been set to expire at the end of January, until the end of March in a series of executive actions on his first day in office.<br />The Biden administration also said it would give homeowners more time—through June 30—to enroll in a program to request a pause or a reduction in mortgage payments.<br />The federal Cares Act signed into law last March by former President Donald Trump let borrowers postpone payments on federally backed mortgages for as long as 12 months.<br />Homeowners will now be able to receive up to six months of additional mortgage payment forbearance, in increments of three months, for those borrowers who entered forbearance before June 30, 2020, the White House said. Borrowers who enter into such plans can skip payments if they suffer a pandemic-related hardship but have to make them up later.</td>

      <td>Marriott International Inc.  Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson, who created the world’s largest hotel operator by acquiring Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. in 2016, died Monday. He was 62.<br />A Lutheran missionary’s son who was born in Japan and grew up in Minnesota, he became CEO of Marriott in 2012 and was the first person outside the founding family to head the hotel company. He was diagnosed with stage 2 pancreatic cancer in May 2019 but continued to serve as CEO.<br />The $13 billion acquisition of Starwood created a colossus with 30 brands—including Ritz-Carlton, Courtyard, W Hotels, Westin and Sheraton—and operations in more than 110 countries. Marriott prevailed over rival bidders including  Hyatt Hotels Corp.  and China’s Anbang Insurance Group Co.<br />Marriott coveted Starwood partly to gain more leverage with online travel agents and persuade them to take a smaller cut when customers choose a Marriott brand. Adding more brand choices might also induce more customers to go directly to Marriott’s website, cutting out the middlemen. “We think there are real advantages to size,” Mr. Sorenson told The Wall Street Journal when the purchase was completed.<br />Marriott said Tuesday that Stephanie Linnartz, the group president for consumer operations, technology and emerging businesses, and Tony Capuano, the group president for global development, design and operations services, will share responsibility for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the company. The two had assumed those duties when Mr. Sorenson stepped back earlier in the month.</td>

The total market value of bitcoin in circulation rose to $940 billion. Bitcoin later receded from its high, recently trading near $48,962.<br />The $50,000 level is an “emotional level for people in the space,” said Brian Melville, head of strategy at trading firm Cumberland.

The firm calculated that about 359,000 bitcoins were bought in the same period, and that imbalance has continued in 2021. “It’s a really important metric to watch,” he added.<br />That buying demand has brought not only a price rally, but growing acceptance and recognition of an asset that was once an object of derision for regulators and lawmakers.</td>

      <td>Competing acquisition offers for Coherent have pushed laser maker’s valuation to decade high</td>
      <td>Whoever ends up buying  Coherent  may have some explaining to do.<br />In a raging bull market that has left few apparent bargains to be had, the maker of laser components used in OLED displays, semiconductor manufacturing and many other applications likely looked like a steal. Its stock price had slumped 10% last year as sales continued their slide since late 2018. John Marchetti of Stifel downgraded the company following its fiscal year-end results in November, predicting a transition year ahead with limited upside as the company planned to expand its markets.<br />But in less than a month’s time, Coherent has gone from not to hot. The company landed its third acquisition offer in as many weeks on Friday.  II-VI Inc. —pronounced two-six—offered a cash-and-stock deal valuing Coherent at $260 a share. That was just days after  MKS Instruments  offered $240 a share in cash and stock, which itself topped a bid worth about $226 a share from  Lumentum Holdings  that Coherent agreed to on Jan. 19. Even the lowest of those bids values Coherent’s stock at its highest price since early 2018.<br />Coherent said Monday its board has decided to engage in discussions with II-VI, while it also evaluates the offer from MKS. It has yet to change its formal recommendation to shareholders approving the deal with Lumentum. Per the original agreement, Coherent would owe Lumentum a termination fee of $217.6 million if it calls off that deal in favor of another offer.<br />Any further offers would be in thin air. The current round of bids values the shares between 34 and 40 times forward earnings—a multiple Coherent hasn’t commanded since 2009, according to FactSet. That has cast a pall on all of the bidders. Lumentum’s share price fell nearly 17% between the date of the announced deal and the competing offer from MKS on Monday. MKS shares fell 8% when that company announced its own offer, while II-VI shares fell nearly 10% on Friday. Shares of Lumentum and II-VI—the two bidders most likely to succeed—were still down well below their preannouncement levels Monday morning.</td>

Relief measures cushioned the blow to consumers and businesses. But as vaccines are administered and countries start to loosen restrictions, the removal of support could expose weak points in the economy and hamper any bounce back.<br />“Withdrawing fiscal support too soon could exacerbate the effects of the economic crisis and put financial stability at risk,” said Claudia Buch, vice president of the German central bank and chair of the ESRB’s working group. “Maintaining fiscal support for too long would increase budgetary pressures” for governments and potentially foster the creation of zombie companies, she added.</td>

      <td>Boeing ’s  ambitions for a midrange plane may be the right idea at the wrong time—again.<br />Last year, the Chicago-based manufacturer started conversations with customers about building such a jet with a single-aisle cabin. Then, during the fourth-quarter earnings presentation in late January, Chief Executive David Calhoun all but confirmed that the company’s next jet would indeed address the “middle of the market” between long international flights and short-haul domestic ones.<br />This appears to end speculation that Boeing could prioritize a replacement for the troubled 737 MAX, which is now flying again. It is a good call not to undermine MAX sales with talk of a substitute.<br />Last week, the buzz increased after trade journal Aviation Week reported that the new jet could instead be a two-aisle model, reviving the so-called New Midsize Airplane project that Boeing abandoned when Mr. Calhoun took over last year. This time, though, the program wouldn’t just have two variants seating 225 and 275 people, but also a third, smaller one.<br />Boeing has been here before. In 1982, it addressed the middle of the market with its 757 and 767 models. But the 200-seat 757 turned out to be too far ahead of its time: It never gained popularity, only ever finding a place as a repurposed trans-Atlantic jet in the 1990s.</td>

A deal would combine CoreLogic, one of the largest residential real-estate data companies, with CoStar, among the biggest providers of commercial real-estate information and analytics.<br />Stone Point Capital LLC and Insight Partners earlier this month agreed to buy the company for $80 a share, and The Wall Street Journal reported that CoStar was considering options including a new bid. CoStar on Tuesday said it has made multiple acquisition proposals to CoreLogic since October.<br />“We were surprised to see your announcement of the pending transaction when we believed that our last conversation with your advisers had addressed all of your remaining concerns,” CoStar Chief Executive Andrew Florance said in a letter to CoreLogic’s board, referring to the $6 billion deal.<br />CoreLogic shareholders would get 0.1019 share of CoStar for each CoreLogic share they own, according to CoStar’s proposal. CoreLogic said the deal with Stone Point Capital and Insight Partners remains in effect and that it is still urging shareholders to approve the agreement. The company will review CoStar’s proposal with outside legal counsel and financial advisers, it said.</td>

Some establishments along the state’s borders with Minnesota and Illinois, where rules are more stringent, have actually seen a boost in business.<br />In the most recent episode of dueling moves by the governor and legislature, Wisconsin residents experienced whiplash Feb. 4 when within the course of about an hour the state went from having a mask mandate, to not having one, to having one again.<br />“There is an inability to reach an agreement and move things forward,” said Charles Franklin, director of a statewide poll conducted by Marquette Law School. “What we have seen for almost a year now is legislative opposition to some of the governor’s actions, but then the legislature has not advanced its own proposal.”</td>

The shift has brought a wave of new business to Shopify, which sells subscription services that enable people to put up websites, accept online payments, and ship and track orders to customers.<br />But Shopify’s business model carries risks. Analysts expect the surge in e-commerce that drove much of the company’s growth to taper as the pandemic ebbs. “There could be a material deceleration in sales growth,” said Tom Forte, an analyst with DA Davidson.<br />Another risk: Many of the startups that use Shopify’s services are more likely to fail than grow meaningfully, said Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “How can you get capital, and how do you scale up in this kind of environment and this kind of uncertainty?” he said.<br />Most of Shopify’s more than one million customers are first-time entrepreneurs, said Harley Finkelstein, president of the Ottawa-based company, which will report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. “Imagine a future where everyone is an entrepreneur.

She was also accused of a second offense under a natural disaster management law, which has been applied in Myanmar against those who break pandemic-linked restrictions, the lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said.<br />Mr. Zaw wasn’t informed of the second allegation until he was briefed by the judge after the video proceedings, he said. A police spokesman didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />Protesters have been demanding for days that Ms. Suu Kyi, who commands immense popularity and was detained in her house in the capital, Naypyitaw, during the Feb. 1 coup, be set free. The coup ended a decadelong shift toward democracy, putting the military—which ruled for half a century before the transition—back in absolute control. Faced with international pressure and large street demonstrations, the generals have doubled down in recent days.<br />For the last two nights, they ordered near-total internet blackouts. In a show of force, tanks showed up in the streets of Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, on Sunday and Monday. Protesters familiar with military rule live in terror of nightly raids and arrests. Some neighborhoods have assembled teams to keep a watch and alert residents if security forces are sighted.</td>

      <td>Tech investor again rides wave of optimism, but enjoys stronger foundation than in 2000 internet bubble</td>
      <td>TOKYO—After 21 years,  SoftBank Group Corp.  is back on top.<br />Shares of the Japanese tech investor on Tuesday surpassed the peak they hit on Feb. 18, 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble. They closed at 10,420 yen, equivalent to $98.96, which was almost double their price a year ago, and topped the old split-adjusted record of ¥10,111.1.<br />Much about the  SoftBank  of two decades ago would look familiar to investors today, starting with its guiding principle of betting big on the next tech revolution. Then, as now, global stock markets were on a tear, startups were listing at eye-popping prices, and SoftBank was building a huge stable of private companies.<br />“Structurally, we’re at the beginning of the AI [artificial intelligence] revolution, just as we were at the beginning of the internet revolution” in 2000, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said at a press conference in Tokyo last week where the company reported around $11 billion in quarterly profit.<br />The differences are important, too. Analysts say today’s SoftBank, known for its $100 billion Vision Fund, is more capable of withstanding market turbulence, even if stocks take a dive again.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—Nine veteran pro-democracy activists appeared together in court Tuesday on charges related to the mass protests that rocked the city in 2019, in a trial that stands out for the number and prominence of the defendants facing prosecution.<br />They include 82-year-old pro-democracy campaigner Martin Lee, newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai and seven others who face charges of illegal assembly that carry possible sentences of up to five years in prison.<br />While the prosecution of Hong Kong’s opposition has become increasingly commonplace, the defendants in the trial beginning Tuesday are a Who’s Who of an earlier generation of activists who have been fighting for core issues like the rule of law and political participation since before the U.K. returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.<br />Mr. Lee is a U.K.-trained lawyer who co-founded the city’s first pro-democracy party and helped write Hong Kong’s foundational legal document, the 1990 Basic Law. Others charged include Margaret Ng, a 73-year-old barrister; Albert Ho, a 69-year-old lawyer and activist; Lee Cheuk-yan, a 64-year-old labor leader, and Leung Kwok-hung, also 64, a longtime politician and activist known as “Long Hair.”<br />Police arrested the group last April in coordinated early-morning raids that surprised many in the city, since those targeted were generally associated with peaceful activism and running for elected office—not the often bitter clashes between young protesters and the police. For many, the arrests signaled that authorities intended to go beyond prosecuting protesters who committed violence to crush the democracy movement itself.</td>

      <td>Spread of British and other variants is accelerating even as overall numbers fall, likely extending restrictions through the region’s winter</td>
      <td>The spread of highly contagious coronavirus variants is accelerating in Europe, outpacing an already-slow vaccine rollout and forcing governments to extend and possibly tighten restrictions on civil society and businesses to prevent a new surge in infections before the end of the region’s winter.<br />A shortage of vaccines in the European Union—only 4.8% of Europeans have been vaccinated since late December—means the continent hasn’t even started the race against virus mutations that many experts say will define health policy in coming months and years.<br />Most European countries are experiencing a steady decline in infections following months of lockdowns, yet the spread of the new variants first identified in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil—known as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 respectively—is accelerating, meaning these viruses are rapidly gaining ground under cover from the overall declining numbers.<br />The three variants now circulating in Europe are believed to be more easily transmitted, and potentially more dangerous, than the original pathogen that still makes up the majority of cases in Europe. There is also mounting evidence that some strains might be less susceptible to the vaccines currently authorized in the region, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.<br />The variant first identified in Britain accounted for 96% of viral samples examined at three major laboratories in England by early February, compared with just over a third at the beginning of December, according to the U.K. government.</td>

With cash reserves at his Long Beach, Calif.-based EPIC Entertainment Group running low, a grant would help him to keep paying his two workers.<br />A month later, the Small Business Administration has yet to say when the program will launch, and Mr. Sheldon said he has been confused by eligibility guidelines the agency has issued so far.<br />Feeling that he couldn’t afford to wait for clarity on such issues, Mr. Sheldon instead applied for a potentially much smaller amount under a separate coronavirus aid program of forgivable loans for small businesses that is available now.<br />“At this point, it’s either accept funding now and keep moving forward, or two people would have to be let go,” Mr. Sheldon said.</td>

Meanwhile, surging e-commerce deliveries are driving up demand for warehouses, particularly those leased to large companies like  Amazon.com Inc.<br />Foreign buyers “see that type of investment as effectively a corporate bond given by one of the largest companies in the world,” said Matthew Alshouse, a partner at law firm DLA Piper.<br />A subsidiary of France’s AXA Investment Managers in December bought a majority stake in 27 U.S. logistics facilities from Cabot Properties for $875 million.
