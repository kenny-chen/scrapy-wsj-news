      <td>A well-meaning social-media campaign to free young women kidnapped by Boko Haram galvanized rescue efforts—and may have spurred the jihadist group to expand its use of gender violence</td>
      <td>On the evening of April 14, 2014, a band of gunmen stormed into a girls boarding school in the northeast Nigerian town of Chibok and carried away more than 200 students who had been preparing for their graduation exams. The young women were taken to the remote forest hideout of a little-known Islamist sect named Boko Haram.<br />For weeks, almost no one seemed to notice the students were missing. Then the news went viral on  Twitter ,  prompting some of the world’s most recognizable people—Pope Francis, Kim Kardashian, The Rock, Michelle Obama—to fire off a hashtag that lighted up billions of phones: #BringBackOurGirls. Those four words quickly demonstrated the power of social media to advance a distant cause. The girls became a global priority. To free them, a number of the world’s most powerful countries sent their armed forces, drones, satellites and sophisticated surveillance equipment. And then, just as quickly, Twitter’s hive mind swarmed onto its next viral cause, the Ice Bucket Challenge, and never returned.<br />Yet those few days of tweets lighted a fuse that continues to burn years later. The rescue mission launched in 2014 has quietly and covertly evolved into a military deployment across four West African countries. Nigeria’s military, U.S. diplomats and terrorism specialists still express bewilderment that a short-lived series of tweets so profoundly shaped the conflict with Boko Haram and other jihadist groups, which continue to kidnap children for fame, footsoldiers and ransom.<br />Through hundreds of interviews with officials involved in rescue efforts and 20 of the Chibok girls who won their freedom, we found a yearslong trail of far-ranging yet unintended outcomes that neither the advocates nor the cynics who dismissed the campaign as “slacktivism” could have foreseen.<br />The frenzied international coverage inspired both a race to free the women and a shift in Boko Haram’s tactics. Within months, the group was boasting that it had kidnapped vastly more young women, ransoming some and dispatching others as its first female suicide bombers. “The hashtag unwittingly provided Boko Haram with a road map to use gender violence to further its global brand,” says Nigerian writer Tricia Adaobi Nwaubani, who has interviewed more than 200 of the Chibok families.</td>

      <td>Content moderation rules used to be a question of taste. Now, they can determine a service’s prospects for survival.</td>
      <td>Every public communication platform you can name—from  Facebook ,   Twitter  and YouTube to Parler,  Pinterest  and Discord—is wrestling with the same two questions:<br />How do we make sure we’re not facilitating misinformation, violence, fraud or hate speech?<br />At the same time, how do we ensure we’re not censoring users?<br />The more they moderate content, the more criticism they experience from those who think they’re over-moderating. At the same time, any statement on a fresh round of moderation provokes some to point out objectionable content that remains. Like any question of editorial or legal judgment, the results are guaranteed to displease someone, somewhere—including Congress, which this week called the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to a hearing on March 25 to discuss misinformation on their platforms.<br />For many services, this has gone beyond a matter of user experience, or growth rates, or even ad revenue. It’s become an existential crisis. While dialing up moderation won’t solve all of a platform’s problems, a look at the current winners and losers suggests that not moderating enough is a recipe for extinction.</td>

      <td>ROME—Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Cardinal Robert Sarah as head of the Vatican’s office for liturgy, removing an outspoken conservative and possible future pope from the ranks of Vatican leadership.<br />The Holy See Press Office announced Saturday that Cardinal Sarah had stepped down. No successor has been named.<br />The cardinal submitted his resignation as required by church law when he turned 75 on June 15 of last year. But the pope frequently lets cardinals serve two or three years past that age, though not past 80.<br />In accepting Cardinal Sarah’s resignation, the pope has removed a subordinate out of step with his approach to liturgy, homosexuality and relations with the Muslim world. The cardinal is a hero to many conservative Catholics, some of whom see him as a future pontiff. He will still be able to vote in a conclave to elect a pope until he turns 80.<br />Last year, the cardinal raised controversy with a book widely interpreted as an attempt to influence Pope Francis’ decision on whether to allow the ordination of married men as priests. The episode led to  embarrassment for the cardinal when retired Pope Benedict XVI asked to have his name removed as the book’s co-author.</td>

      <td>Tech billionaire joined with researchers to track infections; effort explored coronavirus immunity</td>
      <td>When Covid-19 shut down the U.S. economy in March, Elon Musk had a rocket to launch.<br />The billionaire’s space exploration venture, SpaceX, was planning to blast a crewed spacecraft into the sky in May and wanted to stay on schedule. That meant finding a way to keep facilities safely open and limit the spread of Covid-19, a challenge when tests were in short supply.<br />To monitor the prevalence of the virus among SpaceX workers nationwide, Mr. Musk and the rocket company’s top medical executive worked with doctors and academic researchers to build an antibody-testing program. More than 4,000 SpaceX workers volunteered for monthly blood tests.<br />This week the group published its findings, which suggest that a certain threshold of antibodies might provide people lasting protection against the virus. Mr. Musk is listed as a co-author of the peer-reviewed study, which appears in the journal Nature Communications.<br />“People can have antibodies, but it doesn’t mean they are going to be immune” to Covid-19, said Galit Alter, a co-author of the study who is a member of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard. Individuals who experienced fewer, milder Covid-19 symptoms generated fewer antibodies and were therefore less likely to meet the threshold for longer-term immunity, the study found.</td>

A steady stream of institutional demand has been credited with driving much of that rally. Billionaire hedge-fund managers disclosed purchases: Paul Tudor Jones called it a “great speculation.” A handful of companies, most notably  Tesla Inc.,  recently started buying it for their corporate reserves.<br />Yet determining a fair value for bitcoin is much harder than valuing stocks, investors say, both because bitcoin isn’t a traditional asset and because much about it is misunderstood.<br />“It’s a difficult asset class to value,” said  J.P. Morgan  analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, who estimates the value of one bitcoin could be as little as $11,000 or as much as $146,000.</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—A Russian court denied an appeal by Alexei Navalny, sealing an earlier ruling that would see the prominent Kremlin critic and anticorruption activist spend a lengthy sentence in a penal colony.<br />Mr. Navalny, whose detention in January sparked mass protests that mushroomed into a broader act of defiance against Russian President Vladimir Putin, was sentenced earlier this month for violating the conditions of a suspended sentence from 2014. Mr. Navalny was detained upon returning from Germany, where he spent months recovering from a poison attack that he blames on Mr. Putin. The Kremlin denies any involvement.<br />The rallies, which at one point saw over 40,000 people on the streets of Moscow and thousands more across the country, were met with a sweeping crackdown by the authorities, who detained more than 10,000. While Mr. Navalny’s allies have temporarily suspended large-scale protests until the spring, the protest wave has cemented his position as Mr. Putin’s most vocal critic and a potent threat to the Kremlin leader’s two-decade-old rule.<br />At the hearing on Saturday, Mr. Navalny appeared inside a glass cage for defendants and flashed a “V” sign for victory. He rejected the notion that he was hiding from justice, saying that his whereabouts were publicly known, and he described the legal process as absurd.<br />“If I was hiding, I wouldn’t be standing here in this aquarium,” Mr. Navalny told the court.</td>

      <td>Scientists say high rates of viral spread in a partially immunized population could encourage mutations that make virus harder to contain</td>
      <td>Scientists say the world has reached a precarious point in the Covid-19 pandemic, one where conditions are ripe for the rise of more new coronavirus variants that could complicate efforts to control the disease.<br />The virus continues to spread rapidly in many parts of the world, even as segments of the population have gained some degree of immunity as a result of having been infected or vaccinated.<br />Scientists say that combination—high rates of viral transmission and a partially immunized population—encourages the emergence of variants that are potentially more transmissible or more lethal. More transmission means more opportunities for the virus to evolve, they say.<br />“If everyone has immunity, then you have pretty much no virus circulating and the virus can’t adapt,” University of Bern molecular epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft said, adding that if no one within a population has immunity, then there’s no pressure on the virus to evolve. “That middle part, where you have a partially vaccinated population, or a partially immune population with lots of virus circulating, that’s kind of your danger point,” she said.<br />New variants could also reduce the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments and lead to reinfections among people who have already recovered from Covid-19, scientists say. The key to minimizing these problems, they say, lies with social distancing and other measures to reduce contagion as well as with ramping up vaccination efforts, which have lagged behind in many places.</td>

      <td>The months since tennis returned to action last fall have been one long experiment for players—in preparation, in logistics, and in not going crazy. They have been locked in hotel rooms, torn up training plans, and bounced from bubble to bubble. This winter, they traveled halfway around the world for an Australian Open that wasn’t guaranteed to happen.<br />But somewhere in all the uncertainty, Japan’s Naomi Osaka became the surest thing in tennis. Practically undefeated in any competitive match since the coronavirus hiatus last summer, Osaka on Saturday won the Australian Open by beating American Jennifer Brady 6-4, 6-3 in Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena.<br />Osaka, 23, now has four Grand Slam titles to her name, adding to the 2018 and 2020 U.S. Opens, plus her win in Australia in 2019. She has never lost a major final.<br />On a women’s circuit that has grown extremely deep—eight of the previous 17 majors had been won by first-time champions—Osaka has turned into a model of consistency. The last woman not named Serena Williams to rack up her fourth major was Maria Sharapova at Roland-Garros in 2012. And she did it without a pandemic dropping into her career.<br />“I think the thing that I’m most proud of is now mentally strong I’ve become. I used to be really up and down,” Osaka said before the final. “The quarantine process and seeing everything that’s going on in the world, for me it put a lot into perspective…I used to weigh my entire existence on if I won or lost a tennis match. That’s just not how I feel any more.”</td>

Panel of Experts that monitors the ban on transfers of weapons to Libya says companies controlled by Mr. Prince provided three aircraft to assist in sending helicopters and military contractors to help Russian-backed Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar in 2019.<br />The plan to send Western mercenaries to Libya developed as foreign weapons and fighters poured into the country in 2019 and 2020 from a variety of outside powers, including Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, deepening a conflict that has been ongoing since 2014, the report says, according to the diplomat.<br />Mr. Prince is likely to be referred to the U.N.’s Sanctions Committee, which could order a freeze on his assets or a travel ban, according to the New York-based diplomat and a former official with knowledge of the situation. The permanent members of the Security Council, including the U.S., Russia, or China, could veto any potential sanctions against Mr. Prince, who has had dealings with all three countries.<br />“Erik Prince had absolutely nothing to do with any operation in Libya in 2019, or at any other time,” a spokesman for Mr. Prince said in an email.</td>

The Reddit user, whose real name is Keith Gill, now holds 100,000 shares of GameStop worth about $4 million, the screenshot shows.<br />The post doesn’t indicate when the shares were purchased.

They closed Feb. 3 at $92.41.<br />Mr. Gill appeared at a congressional hearing about the GameStop frenzy on Thursday where he was asked by a lawmaker if he thought the stock was still appealing. “I do find that it’s an attractive investment at this price point,” he responded.</td>

      <td>His proposal this week is dead on arrival, but smaller bills might pass.</td>
      <td>Partisans on both sides during the Trump Presidency used immigration to bludgeon each other, but President Biden has a fresh opening for bipartisan cooperation. Now we’ll find out if Democrats want to reform immigration or keep using it as a political cudgel.<br />Mr. Biden made an opening offer Thursday with a bill by New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez and California Rep. Linda Sanchez. The bill is dead on arrival in Congress since it doesn’t improve border security and provides more or less blanket legalization to the country’s 11 million or so undocumented immigrants. “We must not start with concessions out of the gate. We are not going to start with two million undocumented people instead of 11 million,” Mr. Menendez said. “We will never win an argument that we don’t have the courage to make.”<br />GOP restrictionists during the Trump Presidency also introduced immigration bills that were essentially political statements. They went nowhere. The lesson for Democrats is they won’t win an argument in Congress or the public without making concessions to the other party and immigration realities.<br />Start with the bill’s eight-year path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and three years for some farm workers and young adults who were brought to the country illegally as children. No matter what restrictionists say, most of these folks will never be deported. Many have been here for decades and contribute significantly to the economy.<br />The young adults known as Dreamers are particularly sympathetic since they didn’t knowingly break immigration laws and live in legal limbo. Barack Obama granted them temporary legal status and work permits. As we’ve argued, he didn’t have the legal authority to do so since the Constitution grants Congress power to regulate immigration. But Congress also has a moral imperative to grant a reprieve after the government invited them to come out of the shadows.</td>

      <td>His CFPB pick wants a new agency to control politics and speech.</td>
      <td>In our age of a powerful administrative state and weak Congress, some of the most consequential government officials are the little-known heads of alphabet-soup federal agencies. One of them is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which was designed as its own regulatory fiefdom insulated from accountability. So it’s worrying that President Biden’s nominee to head the agency wants the administrative state to extend its reach into political speech.<br />Mr. Biden sent the nomination of Rohit Chopra, an Elizabeth Warren protégé and commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, to the Senate last week. Senators who want to understand Mr. Chopra’s thinking about the role of regulators in American democracy might crack open a report he co-authored in 2018 for the Roosevelt Institute. It envisions an unaccountable Washington “corruption” czar writing rules, issuing fines and working his will over politicians, think tanks and nonprofits.<br />If that sounds constitutionally suspect, well, it comes with the progressive territory. The Supreme Court ruled last year that the CFPB’s design was unconstitutional because its director, who is appointed by the President for a five-year term, could only be removed for cause.<br />The Court said giving a regulator that much power “clashes with constitutional structure.” But that’s nothing compared to Mr. Chopra’s proposed “Public Integrity Protection Agency” (PIPA), where the director would serve as many as 10 years, “subject to removal proceedings similar to that of a federal judge”—that is, effectively untouchable by the elected branches.<br />Unlike the CFPB, which regulates commerce and loans, Mr. Chopra’s even-less-accountable PIPA would regulate core political activities. The report proposes new restrictions on advocacy, declaring that the “use of think tanks and other nonprofit organizations to further the economic interests of its benefactors through policy research should be impermissible.”</td>

      <td>Finding an open appointment to get the Covid-19 vaccine was a headache, so 90-year-old Fran Goldman wasn’t going to be deterred by some snow. The walk was three miles, each direction. She dressed in layers and grabbed walking sticks. “It was not easy going,” Ms. Goldman told the Seattle Times. “It was challenging.”<br />Did we mention she had a hip replaced last year? But a trek in the snow will be worth it for two great-grandchildren. “I can’t wait to be able to hold them,” Ms. Goldman told the newspaper. Now there’s an antidote to the articles about public skepticism of the vaccines. Polls last year showing hesitancy were noteworthy, but two months into America’s vaccination program, the story is about demand.<br />Here’s another one, though not quite as uplifting. In Florida, which is prioritizing people 65 and older, two women aged 34 and 44 went to an Orange County immunization site “dressed up as grannies,” an official said Thursday. That made national headlines, although it’s not clear whether it was exaggerated.<br />Body-camera video released Friday shows little disguise, but both of the women had face masks and glasses, and one was wearing a gray hat. That said, the women “had altered their years of birth on their vaccination registrations to bypass the state system,” the Orlando Sentinel reported. They apparently had already received a first vaccine dose but were denied the second and issued trespass warnings.<br />A heroic story and a malicious one. Yet both are good signs of vaccine demand, since ending this pandemic depends on getting millions more shots into millions more arms.</td>

      <td>The new U.S. Administration hopes giving up leverage will get Tehran to talk.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s stronger relationship with allies and partners could give him an advantage over Donald Trump in foreign affairs. But his Iran strategy will test whether appeasement with friends produces better outcomes than standing strong alone.<br />Mr. Trump upset Iran, and America’s European allies, by leaving the 2015 nuclear deal and embarking on a “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign. Mr. Biden has said Washington would return to the accord and lift sanctions if Tehran returned to compliance, while the Islamic Republic demanded the inverse. Someone has to blink.<br />The White House hasn’t given in entirely, but this week wasn’t encouraging. On Thursday Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. is committed to resurrecting the nuclear deal after a meeting with his French, German and British counterparts. Later, the U.S. accepted a European offer to mediate with the Iranians, who have yet to respond.<br />Tehran ran circles around Barack Obama’s negotiators, many of whom have returned to the Biden Administration, so it wouldn’t be surprising if Iran now agrees to talks. Some informal negotiations are inevitable, but this was an especially bad week for the U.S. to take the plunge.<br />After rockets hit a U.S. base in Iraq this week, killing a contractor and wounding nine others, including a U.S. service member, the State Department vowed that the U.S. would “hold accountable those responsible.” An Iran-backed militia, with Tehran’s implicit or explicit consent, is almost certainly to blame. Yet the U.S. has responded with a major concession on Iran sanctions that will help empower such groups. Tehran will reasonably think Mr. Biden is so eager for talks that he’ll ignore attacks on Americans.</td>

      <td>Billionaire biotech investor Patrick Soon-Shiong is exploring a sale of the Los Angeles Times less than three years after buying it for $500 million, people familiar with the matter said.<br />The move marks an abrupt about-face for Mr. Soon-Shiong, who had vowed to restore stability to the West Coast news institution and has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into the paper in an effort to turn it around.<br />After The Wall Street Journal published this article, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Times said Mr. Soon-Shiong and his family “continue to invest in and plan for the future of the Los Angeles Times, and do not plan to sell.” A tweet on Mr. Soon-Shiong’s account said: “WSJ article inaccurate. We are committed to the @LATimes.”<br />When Mr. Soon-Shiong acquired the Times, the San Diego Union-Tribune and a handful of weeklies from  Tribune Publishing Co. , then called Tronc Inc., in 2018, it was met with great fanfare from staff and media watchers after years of turmoil and downsizing at the publications. At the time, he said that the sale represented the beginning of a new era and that he intended to do what it took to make the business viable for the next 100 years.<br />He has since grown dissatisfied with the news organization’s slow expansion of its digital audience and its substantial losses, the people said. He also has increasingly come to believe that the Los Angeles Times and San Diego Union-Tribune—together known as the California Times company—would be better served if they were part of a larger media group, they said.</td>

      <td>To follow the pianist into his thoughts can deliver a view from ‘inside of the music.’</td>
      <td>Essay collections don’t get much honor in the book industry, but I have a weakness for them. A compendium of unrelated or loosely related essays by an author you admire allows you to read it when you feel inclined without the discipline of following a book-length argument. Miscellanies by musicians and music critics are a particular favorite of mine, but good ones are rare. The tenor Ian Bostridge published a fine collection, “A Singer’s Notebook,” in 2011, and the critic and composer Robin Holloway’s “On Music: Essays and Diversions,” from 2003, contains some terrific criticism. Before that there is Samuel Lipman’s 1992 “Music and More” and Andrew Porter’s several collections from the 1970s and ’80s.<br />I was therefore eager to read Stephen Hough’s “Rough Ideas: Reflections on Music and More.” Mr. Hough (pronounced huff), a British pianist and an accomplished interpreter of a wide array of classical works, is one of a very few gifted musicians who are capable of writing with clarity and wit.<br />“Rough Ideas” is a gathering of Mr. Hough’s writings on music and performance, and a few on religion. “Many of the reflections in this book,” he explains, “germinated from articles first published in newspapers . . . and magazines” and from blog posts at the Daily Telegraph’s website. Presumably as a consequence of this germination, the pieces include no reference to the place and date of their original publication—a slight annoyance. Indeed, many of the essays, he writes elsewhere, were “unfinished musings on scraps of paper or saved as files on the go on my iPhone” until he used them for this collection.<br />Mr. Hough reminds me a little of Saul Bellow’s character Moses Herzog, who can’t stop scribbling his thoughts about everything, day and night. Do we really need a squib about Mr. Hough’s elderly Russian landlady who made a wonderful meal of beef stroganoff but who wouldn’t give him the recipe because, as she claimed improbably, “General Stroganoff wrote it out for me himself”? Then again, maybe these ramshackle observations work; “Herzog” is a great book.<br />Part of what makes Mr. Hough’s writing on music so appealing is that he writes as a performer, as if somehow from the inside of the music. His recordings of Johannes Brahms’s piano concertos—he plays the Romantic repertoire cleanly and crisply, without any of the histrionic banging one gets from some other famous performers—and here he writes of these two great concertos with insight. “The Second is the better piece,” he writes, “but the First is the greater piece. . . . The Second is better constructed, better orchestrated; themes are better developed; harmonies are better judged; textures are better balanced—but for me the First has a greater burst of pure, utter, natural genius. Its flame flares with such intensity, and with such promise of more to come ([Brahms] was only twenty-five when he wrote it), that I find myself overwhelmed by it in a way I’m not by the Second, written twenty-two years later.” To me, a non-performer, this sounds exactly right.</td>

      <td>‘When we lower our standards to pretend we know what we don’t know, we diminish the work and misinform society,’ says Prof. John Staddon.</td>
      <td>Durham, N.C.<br />When Prof. John Staddon read the “Statement to the Community Regarding Anti-Racism” sent out by Duke University’s president this summer, he was alarmed. The president, Vincent Price, promised to require “anti-racism and anti-bias training for every member of our faculty, student body, and staff.” To Mr. Staddon, that sounded more like indoctrination than academic inquiry. He responded in an open letter.<br />Mr. Price declared: “I cannot as a white person begin to fully understand the daily fear and pain and oppression that is endemic to the Black experience.” Mr. Staddon’s rejoinder: “Your reassurance is fine as an expression of empathy. I daresay you feel better, and possibly your African American audience does as well. But feelings differ: Unless the discussion can be moved from feelings to facts, no harmony is possible. Empathy, guilt, and good intentions are a dodgy basis for sweeping resolutions.”<br />Mr. Price affirmed that the “hard work before us” requires the community to “take transformative action now toward eliminating the systems of racism and inequality. . . . That starts with a personal transformation and . . . must end in institutional transformation.” Mr. Staddon countered that “this phraseology will strike many as more like psychotherapy or a call to religious conversion than a policy prescription. What are these ‘systems of racism and inequality?’ How have they affected Duke and how is Duke involved in them? Or are they societal concerns and thus the responsibility not of a university but of government, the church, and civil society?”<br />This isn’t the first time Mr. Staddon, 83, a tall, English-born American, has challenged the dogma of his peers. A professor of psychology, neuroscience and biology, he is something of a modern Cassandra, warning for more than three decades of the corruption of academia by political activists. As America becomes woke, his scholarly critiques read like prophecy.</td>

      <td>Among other errors, 70% of the doses the government bought aren’t yet approved by its health officials.</td>
      <td>Toronto<br />If you’re impatient with the pace of Covid-19 vaccine distribution in the U.S., count your blessings. At least you don’t live in Canada. As of Wednesday, my country had administered only 3.52 vaccine doses per 100 people, according to the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data website. The U.S., at 17.00, was doing almost five times as well. The figures were 80.07 in Israel, 25.04 in the U.K. and 5.40 in the European Union.<br />Why is Canada such a laggard among developed nations? The government of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau didn’t negotiate contracts with established drug companies. Rather, it quietly approved a working relationship between Canadian researchers and a Chinese vaccine maker,  CanSino Biologics Inc.  CanSino abandoned its project in August after multiple failures. Ottawa then had to rush through agreements with  Pfizer ,  Moderna and other companies. “I would not have put all our eggs in the basket of China,” Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole told reporters.<br />When Canada and other countries experienced a significant spike in Covid-19 cases last month (which has now subsided), Pfizer reduced its shipment to my country by more than two-thirds for several weeks. Moderna announced that only three-quarters of its vaccines would arrive in Canada during early February.<br />Other options are off the table for now. Although Canada purchased 398 million doses in all, more than 70% are vaccines that haven’t received approval from health officials. The Liberals have pointed fingers at drug companies and provincial governments.</td>

      <td>The grid is designed to shut down, and we’re designing it to shut down more often.</td>
      <td>In 2011 an earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, killing 18,500 people, wiping away neighborhoods, depositing fuels, sludge and toxic chemicals across a considerable landscape. And yet all anybody wanted to talk about was a nuclear power accident that killed nobody. This selective focus may well have contributed to an ill-advised evacuation that led to premature deaths. Angela Merkel thereupon kicked off a world-wide retreat from nuclear power that likely put paid to any hope of meeting the greenhouse targets named in the Paris accord.<br />We may be suffering a similar neurosis now. A cold snap that touches all of Texas with subfreezing temperatures is a once-a-century event, if that, and yet our discussion about it is rapidly becoming a self-defeating mess.<br />Twenty years old is a debate about whether America’s grid resilience is in some kind of crisis. For most Texans, this week’s outages were measured in hours and intermittent. They weren’t the five- and 10-day outages experienced by my neighbors in Rob-and-Laura land three or four times in the past 12 years. Texas water shortages due to burst pipes also have a Northeastern parallel. Suburban New Yorkers who rely on electric well pumps were reduced to flushing their toilets with lake or stream water.<br />Federal data are not much help. From 2013 to 2018, routine interruptions were steady; those attributed to “major events” grew sharply in the final two years. But one thing we’ve long known. By design, U.S. systems generate a lot more downtime (as much as 90% more) than systems in many European countries, where population density makes it cost-effective to bury power lines, where hurricanes and tornadoes are unknown, where forests were tamed or removed centuries ago, and where their idea of wilderness is our idea of a suburb.<br />In covering this week’s Texas outages, the Economist magazine couldn’t decide whether the world’s “climate crisis” or “America’s infrastructure crisis” was the right headline. The reality is more prosaic. Significant freezing episodes led to blackouts at least seven times from 1983 to 2011. In Texas, politicians, utility executives and citizens have repeatedly been asked by nature: Do you want to winterize your grid against rare winter outages or do you prefer lower rates? Lower rates kept winning, at least till now.</td>

Mr. Manchin, a centrist who represents a state that voted twice for former President Donald Trump, is seen as a swing vote in the Senate.<br />“I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget,” Mr. Manchin said in a Friday statement. “For this reason, I cannot support her nomination.”<br />The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Manchin’s statement.<br />The Senate has so far confirmed seven of Mr. Biden’s top nominees, all with bipartisan support. If the White House were to pull Ms. Tanden’s nomination or it failed to reach the 51 votes needed for confirmation, it would mark the first time one of Mr. Biden’s nominees has been blocked.</td>

Whether he will remain a significant player politically or not, only time will tell. To say that he “won’t win another national election” is an assertion which I question and find too unsubstantiated to consider valid.<br />It is disturbing that President Biden has signed more than 30 executive orders already, many of them of a very radical nature as is his constant mentioning of systemic racism and white supremacy. In his Inauguration Day speech he claimed he would unify the country, but he’s doing the opposite. His destruction of many thousands of jobs by closing the Keystone XL Pipeline, not following the science and delaying the opening of public schools very clearly show that he is a puppet of the far left of the Democratic Party.<br />There are many millions of Trump followers who are law-abiding citizens, and many not-so-radical Democrats who are now beginning to understand what is going on and know that this radical agenda, woke culture and hypocrisy will get us nowhere good. That, plus the coming tax increases, the underperforming economy, which will come accompanied by a tremendous increase in regulations, will most likely, in a short time, despite the very biased media, make President Trump look good.<br />Abel A.

There is no excuse for what happened on Jan. 6, but a reason it happened is the double standard allowed for the left and the media.<br />Ed Jenkins<br />Camarillo, Calif.<br /><br />No country-club, genteel Republican will win national office again, only fighters like Donald Trump. Donald Trump left office with knives and arrows stuck in his back from Democrats, the media and Republicans alike.

      <td>TIJUANA, Mexico—Hundreds of migrants crowded the pedestrian border crossing with the U.S. here Friday morning as the Biden administration let in the first handful who had been forced to wait in Mexico for their asylum claims to be resolved under Trump administration policy.<br />Biden administration officials had stressed in English and Spanish communications that only people contacted ahead of time would be allowed in Friday while others needed to register online and wait. A San Diego aid group set to receive the migrants said they were told by the government only 25 would be let in Friday.<br />The admissions are part of President Biden’s reversal of the Trump policy officially called Migrant Protection Protocols but generally known as Remain in Mexico. It required migrants seeking asylum, many of them families, to wait in Mexican border cities for their claims to be resolved, rather than in the U.S. as had previously been the case.<br />The waits have been prolonged by the Covid-19 pandemic that closed immigration courts handling their claims.<br />The administration announced last week that, beginning Friday, it would start allowing some migrants in the program to enter the U.S. The government said it is moving slowly because allowing in large numbers of people could pose a public-health risk.</td>

      <td>Why did New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s Health Department work so  hard for so long to prevent accurate disclosure of Covid deaths among the state’s nursing home residents? The governor has presented the scandal as simply a debate about the way deaths were categorized, while rejecting the notion that his policies increased mortality. His position will be harder to maintain after Thursday’s release of a new study from New York’s Empire Center for Public Policy.<br />Readers will recall that the Empire Center is the think tank that spent months trying to pry Covid data out of Mr. Cuomo’s government, which offered a series of unbelievable excuses for its refusal to disclose. Finally on Feb. 10—six months after the Empire Center filed a request under the state’s Freedom of Information Law, five months after it sued the government, and one week after a state court ruled that the Cuomo administration had violated the law and ordered it to come clean—Team Cuomo finally started coughing up some of the records.<br />The Empire Center’s new analysis of long-hidden data suggests that  a key Cuomo policy had disastrous results in the spring of 2020. After reviewing the information on deaths in long-term care facilities, Bill Hammond and Ian Kingsbury of the Empire Center report:<br />The study clearly suggests that Cuomo policy cost lives, and not just a few of them. According to the authors:<br />The Empire Center’s findings directly contradict what the Cuomo Health Department was saying last July—even as officials refused to disclose the underlying data that would have allowed the public to evaluate Cuomo claims.</td>

Friday marks the end of that 30-day period.<br />“The work to reduce our emissions has already begun, and we will waste no time in engaging our partners around the world to build our global resilience,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote on Twitter.<br />Mr. Trump argued that the agreement’s terms weren’t fair to the U.S. because other major emitters weren’t doing enough to cut emissions under the pact. Though Mr. Trump repeatedly said during his presidency that the U.S. was no longer a party to the agreement, the withdrawal became effective in early November 2020, near the end of his term, because it took time to formally exit the pact.</td>

In all, 57 people—including parents, college coaches, test proctors and others—have been charged, and more than 40 have pleaded guilty, including the ringleader, William “Rick” Singer, who is awaiting sentencing.<br />Mr. Caplan pleaded to felony conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest-services mail fraud for paying Mr. Singer to have a proctor change answers on his daughter’s ACT score. In addition to the month in prison, a U.S. District Court judge in Boston sentenced him to 250 hours of community service and a $50,000 fine.<br />Felony convictions often result in the loss of a law license, but a New York appellate court on Thursday agreed with an earlier disciplinary decision that a two-year suspension was enough. Retroactive to around the time of his sentencing, Mr. Caplan can practice law again in November.<br />An attorney for Mr. Caplan, 54 years old, said he “is deeply appreciative of the treatment he has received by the court and is committed to making amends for his conduct.”</td>

      <td>After a dispiriting year of living and working through video, women are investing in fashion and accessories that truly shine on-screen. How to make an impact from the waist up.</td>
      <td>IF WE’RE GOING to do this, then let’s do this,” declared Tanya Golesic over Zoom, flashing a wrist stacked with bangles and a kinetic gold cocktail ring. Ms. Golesic, the 49-year-old president of the Americas for shoe empire Jimmy Choo, initially surrendered to casual wear after leaving her New York home to shelter—and videoconference—in place on Long Island last spring. But once June rolled around, she snapped out of her sartorial slump, slipping into blouses and blazers with outsize sleeves and textural sweaters, all eventfully augmented by baubles. “I think people are over being boring…The whole idea of glamour is coming back.” She fantasizes about setting track pants on fire.<br />Over the past year, we’ve learned how to conduct everything from job interviews to divorces via computer screen. The halfhearted leggings-and-collared-shirt thing was fine when we naively thought confinement would last a few weeks. But the novelty of slobbing about in workout wear all day has waned. Now, thanks to some combination of optimism, sweatshirt fatigue and longing for a pre-pandemic world, many women are not only getting dressed for Zoom—they’re getting decked out.<br />“Feeling like you have a reason to look great is empowering,” said Mercedes Posey, a Dallas clinical operations project manager who has logged into video work calls, galas and girls’ nights. Throwing on such exuberant wares as can’t-miss-’em chandelier earrings, bright-pink tops and a pearl-dappled beret gives Ms. Posey, 35, something to look forward to. Her vivacious work outfits have become such a small-screen sensation that her colleagues protest on the rare occasions her camera’s turned off.<br />If you’re ready to elevate your own Zoom wardrobe, designers are conveniently offering plenty of tempting waist-up fodder this season. Miu Miu saw fit to embellish turtlenecks with crystals. Versace’s oceanic prints will pop against any Zoom background; and Alexander McQueen’s puffy sleeves (like those on the tromp l’oeil corset sweater shown above) cut a sumptuous silhouette on the screen. Swarovski’s new creative director Giovanna Engelbert has just unveiled a bevy of supersize crystal jewelry that, even if worn with a plain T-shirt, will inject even the most droning video call with sparkle. Ms. Engelbert, who designed her debut collection in lockdown, admitted that she “went bigger because of Zoom, probably.”<br />Harriet Hawksworth, the editor in chief at e-commerce platform Farfetch, has noticed a rabid appetite for bright colors, punchy prints (like Marine Serre’s signature crescent moons) and statement accessories. Chunky chain necklaces, hoops and headbands, like the red Prada one that inaugural poet Amanda Gorman wore indelibly at the inauguration, have proven popular. Such emphatic accessories “help you stand out from all the other tiny squares,” said Jennifer Behr, a New York designer known for crystal-covered headbands. Her sales have leapt 40% in the last two months compared with the same period last year.</td>

      <td>Staring at themselves on video has made women everywhere reconsider their beauty routines. Here, an expert guide to looking (relatively) flawless on camera.</td>
      <td>WHEN DID our Zoom screens become so cruel? When you spend some days confronting your own face almost continuously, minuscule flaws become magnified. It’s what New York dermatologist Dendy Engelman calls the Zoom effect. “Zoom is making people notice all of their small imperfections,” she explained. “We are used to seeing our faces statically in the mirror, rather than dynamically as we do on video,” added New York plastic surgeon Adam Kolker. Movements and expressions “often demonstrate facial aging more vividly.”<br />In the age of Zoom-induced self-scrutiny, interest in cosmetic procedures has held strong. Most popular, said Dr. Kolker, are “neuromodulators [like Botox] to decrease lines and injectable fillers [like Restylane and Juvederm] to minimize the perception of deeper wrinkles.” For Miami dermatologist Heather Woolery-Lloyd’s patients, Zoom has cast a spotlight on skin-tone and texture issues, which she addresses with chemical peels and microneedling. Dr. Kolker has also seen an uptick in more invasive surgical procedures. “Since people aren’t traveling or dining out, there is more disposable income to ‘treat yourself,’” said Dr. Engelman.<br />Carine Vinett, the New York-based founder of the Best Friend, a product that helps women zip up the back of their dresses solo, has always adhered to a robust skin care routine, but even she’s not immune to Zoom-inspired insecurity. “I’m the face [of my brand]…and my skin was looking dull and red on Zoom, which made me self-conscious,” she said. Her fix: getting Clear + Brilliant laser treatments and subtle filler in her cheeks, and incorporating products with active ingredients (like Shani Darden’s Texture Reform, which has a mild retinoid) into her daily regimen. “My skin looks brighter, and I’m actually wearing less makeup,” she said. Lindsay Holden, 40, the co-founder of Minneapolis-based haircare brand Odele, Zooms all day, between work meetings and her kids’ web schooling. “An hour rarely goes by that I’m not reminded of what I look like via screen,” she said. “It made me feel like I really needed to up my skin game.” She went from casual to religious eye-cream use, introduced a vitamin C serum (like that from Skinceuticals, below) and used her nighttime retinol more regularly (see one from Shani Darden, below). Cynthia Manick, 41, who Zooms as a project manager in Brooklyn by day and a performing poet by night, has amplified her beauty program, too. Her augmented approach includes a spin brush for cleansing; a rose-quartz gua sha for massaging; biweekly masks; and moisturizers (she rotates between Sunday Riley’s Water Cream and Osea’s Essential Hydrating Oil depending on her skin’s needs).<br />While Zoom has led many to intensify their routines, experts caution against overdoing it. “You do not want to overwork your skin, stripping it and harming its barrier,” said Dr. Engelman. Dry skin will put the signs of aging into sharper focus. “Keeping skin hydrated…will make imperfections disappear,” added Dallas and New York esthetician Joanna Czech.<br />The ideal skin care arsenal includes gentle cleanser, antioxidant serum, good moisturizer, mineral sunscreen (even when you’re inside all day) and a mild retinol. To decrease puffiness, Ms. Czech recommends facial self-massage. Strategically placed highlighter can also help. Using a blender brush, New York makeup artist and co-founder of Westman Atelier Gucci Westman sweeps it up the cheekbones and across the lids. “It’s perfect for adding warmth and definition,” she said.</td>

      <td>Injury can bring a country together. But this is a compound fracture to the national psyche.</td>
      <td>At Newsweek in the old days, they called it “the violin.” At Time, where I worked, we spoke of the “mood of the nation.” It referred to an article, leading the magazine’s national news section in certain weeks, that in a sequence of anecdotes, quotes and generalizations would tell Americans what they were feeling and thinking at that particular moment.<br />A stupid idea, I told myself when I sat down to write one of these things: How could anyone presume to describe the “mood” of more than 200 million people? And yet by the time I finished writing the piece, I often found I had changed my mind and decided the conceit had some validity—that it might honestly touch on thoughts and emotions that Americans shared for a moment. You could see the country whole—or glimpse it. It did not seem wrong to generalize as long as you didn’t get carried away. I found this was true even in the thick of the Vietnam War, the period that was the seedbed of the divisions of our own time.<br />Can there be such a thing as national mood in a country as big and diverse as the U.S.? Consider that the country’s moral, emotional and political atmosphere was radically different on Sept. 12, 2001, from what it had been on Sept. 10. You could say the same thing about Nov. 23, 1963, the day after John Kennedy’s assassination, and Dec. 8, 1941, after Pearl Harbor.<br />National mood may crystallize under the pressure of crisis: a sudden clarity. You didn’t need polls to understand it. We feel distinctive national moods in quieter times, too, though in more elusive, contradictory patterns. Sometimes the river is fairly smooth. Sometimes the country goes over Niagara Falls.<br />At worst, one tremendous mood will collide with another. It was no use for Abraham Lincoln to appeal in his first inaugural to the “mystic chords of memory”—to a reverence for the history that Americans had in common. Too late. The country went ahead with the Civil War.</td>

      <td>Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.</td>
      <td>When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won her upset victory against Democratic Rep. Joseph Crowley in 2018, she had the backing of the Democratic Socialists of America. What she lacked was a single endorsement from New York’s powerful unions. Since then, candidates supported by the DSA have scored more wins against union-supported incumbents. As New York heads into an election cycle that will shape the politics of America’s largest city for the next four years, unions and the DSA are on a collision course.<br />New York’s unions are a heterodox group, ranging from public-sector outfits like the United Federation of Teachers and District Council 37, which cherish the rich compensation they’ve won for members over the years, to more conservative trade unions like the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, which benefit when the city’s economy grows. Despite their sometimes divergent interests, these unions have always found enough common cause to become a central force in the city’s Democratic coalition. But they were caught off guard by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s appeal, especially in gentrifying neighborhoods where recently arrived young progressives embraced her antiestablishment campaign.<br />After her election, union leaders tried to play down their support for Mr. Crowley, arguing that they had little choice but to support an incumbent. “You’re constantly making pragmatic decisions about the relationships that you need to have if you’re a union that relies on the government to assist with some of the things that you need for your members,” Bob Master, local political director of the Communications Workers of America, told Jacobin magazine. “Young radicals need to understand this.”<br />But if labor leaders expected young radicals to accept the way things worked, they were naive. Quickly, DSA officials began plotting to infiltrate local unions and overthrow their leadership. In August 2019 Politico New York published a DSA memo outlining a “strategy for militant, democratic, classwide struggles” that included stinging assessments of some unions.<br />About the powerful United Federation of Teachers, DSA said: “Simply put, it is tremendously influential politically, but fails to exercise the full potential of its power. Its strategy rests on electing fairly centrist/conservative Democrats.” The New York Hotel Trades Council, with more than 35,000 members, “seems to have shifted towards accommodation in its relations” with management. A recent contract, the memo said, “attempts to impose a suffocating and prolonged period of employer-friendly labor peace.”</td>

      <td>The exuberant monuments of the French-American sculptor are the focus of a new exhibition at MoMA PS1.</td>
      <td>The artist Niki de Saint Phalle is perhaps best known for the sculptures she called “Nanas”—colorful, outsize women whose exuberant curves defy all notions of restraint or decorum. But for Saint Phalle, those ebullient figures were only a warm-up. “I felt compelled to prove that a woman could work on a monumental scale,” she wrote. She went on to create fanciful, building-sized constructions—women, dragons, monsters, towers—that double as artworks and habitable spaces.<br />“Niki de Saint Phalle: Structures for Life,” a new exhibition opening March 11 at MoMA PS1 in Queens, N.Y., will be the first New York show to survey the artist’s decades-long career, with an emphasis on her monumental projects. The more than 200 works on view include sculptures, maquettes, prints, drawings, books and jewelry—and of course, Nanas. “Clarice Again” (1966-67), standing not quite 7 feet tall, greets visitors in the show’s opening gallery. First appearing in the mid-1960s, “these big, happy women were a political statement” meant to counter what Saint Phalle saw as “regressive or patriarchal thinking,” said the exhibition’s organizer, PS1 curator Ruba Katrib. Despite their winsome charm, Saint Phalle wanted the Nanas “to become almost intimidating figures.”<br />Saint Phalle had a knack for embedding provocative ideas in playful forms. Born in 1930 to a French aristocrat father and French-American mother, she had what might seem a storybook life: a privileged childhood, immediate success as a teenage fashion model, followed by marriage to a childhood friend and early acclaim as an avant-garde artist. But that glossy exterior concealed a history of childhood sexual abuse that led Saint Phalle to a nervous breakdown at 23, when she was confined to an asylum in France. “These are things that she brought into her work constantly,” Ms. Katrib said, “processing them through her art.”<br />At MoMA PS1, the show’s first gallery focuses on Saint Phalle’s monumental projects. They include the “Stravinsky Fountain” (1983) in Paris, created with her longtime companion, the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely (1925-1991), as well as “Golem” (1972), a playground slide in the shape of a monster with three bright red tongues, made for a kid-filled neighborhood in Jerusalem. Commissioned as a child’s playhouse, “Le Dragon de Knokke” (1973-75), built in a seaside town in Belgium, holds a main room, kitchen, bath and second-floor sleeping area, along with a child-sized play area in the tail. In 1987, Keith Haring stayed there while painting a mural in Knokke, leaving behind—with Saint Phalle’s blessing—a frieze-like drawing along the interior stairway and balcony.<br />Roughly half the main gallery at PS1 is devoted to Saint Phalle’s magnum opus, “Tarot Garden,” which fills 14 acres of Tuscan countryside with sculptures and structures based on the 22 picture cards of the tarot deck. Work on the project began in 1979 and ended only with the artist’s death in 2002. The tallest structure in “Tarot Garden” tops out at roughly 50 feet; Saint Phalle herself lived for years in the sphinx-like work known as “The Empress,” which houses a bedroom and bath in one breast and a kitchen in the other.</td>

Beijing has also laid claim to disputed islands in the South and East China seas, staged shows of force against Taiwan, which it considers a breakaway Chinese territory, and moved to crack down on Hong Kong’s political autonomy and civil liberties.<br />The Biden administration has in its first month moved to renew relationships with allies as a way of competing jointly with China, while maintaining the overall tougher U.S. approach taken at the end of former President Donald Trump’s term.</td>

A House committee will hold a hearing next week with the acting Capitol Police chief and acting House Sergeant at Arms.<br />Lawmakers and other Capitol Police officers have questioned why the force was so unprepared for the attack.

Thomas showed exceptional talent, and was enrolled in 1857 at Central High School, which had a substantial curriculum in art and science.<br />There he expanded his technical skills and had his first exposure to perspective drawing. Following this, he entered the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1862, and took life classes drawing the nude model. All of these pursuits were critical factors in the shaping of his future career.<br />But what may have had the greatest impact on Eakins’s future were the lectures on human anatomy at Jefferson Medical College, which he attended in 1864, just as he was finishing work at the Pennsylvania Academy. He bypassed the Civil War, and at his father’s urging left for further study in Europe in 1866.</td>

      <td>To make real progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, President Biden and Congress will need to break with environmentalist dogmas.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration’s climate efforts seemingly began with a bang. Within days of his inauguration, President Biden announced a slew of climate-related executive orders, including plans to rejoin the Paris Agreement, cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and suspend new oil and gas leasing on public lands. Some of these actions will have a tangible impact. But much of what Mr. Biden announced was performative, offering succor to his environmental supporters but not much else. In truth, his ability to move the needle on U.S. emissions through executive action is extremely limited.<br />Consider that Obama-era regulations on power plant emissions, which President Biden may try to promulgate again, didn’t actually require significantly lower emissions than what will likely happen anyway, as natural gas and renewable energy continue to displace coal-generated electricity. He may, similarly, attempt to reinstate automobile fuel efficiency standards that President Trump dismantled. But with the nation’s auto makers already moving quickly to electric vehicles, the emissions benefits to be gained from another round of trench warfare over efficiency requirements for internal combustion vehicles are likely to be underwhelming.<br />Mr. Biden’s options are limited for other reasons on Capitol Hill. Notwithstanding the bold talk from Democrats and environmentalists, neither Congress nor the public appear to have much stomach for costly regulatory actions. Democrats simply do not have the votes to pass carbon caps, carbon taxes or a Green New Deal. And even were they able to do so, the history of such policies is not promising. Neither carbon trading systems nor carbon taxes, for instance, has done much to deeply cut emissions anywhere in the world.<br />If there is good news for President Biden, it is that U.S. emissions have been falling for the last decade, thanks in large part to years of federal investment in clean technology, from research and development to loan guarantees to tax credits. Today, wind, solar, battery and electric vehicle technologies are increasingly competitive in many parts of the country without ongoing subsidies or mandates. These policies have reliably been supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. So there is a path for Mr. Biden to accelerate progress on cutting emissions, one that depends less on defeating climate-skeptical Republicans in Congress and more on doubling down on the things that are working already: technology, infrastructure, economic productivity and partnerships with the private sector to accelerate innovation.<br />That path may sound easier. But it brings its own challenges, as it will likely require Mr. Biden to confront a number of longstanding environmental shibboleths that stand in the way of deeply cutting U.S. emissions.</td>

      <td>Justice Department veterans hope his appointment will bring a steady hand after a tumultuous period</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Five years after his Supreme Court nomination died in a political standoff, Merrick Garland is expected to get a bipartisan welcome during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday as President Biden’s choice for attorney general.<br />The federal judge and former prosecutor is likely to face questions about the Justice Department’s handling of a rise in extremist violence such as the  attack by Donald Trump supporters on the U.S. Capitol and, when Republicans have their turn, the destruction in Portland, Ore., and Seattle that followed Black Lives Matter protests last summer.<br />If confirmed, Judge Garland, a 1997 Clinton appointee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, would also oversee several politically sensitive investigations begun under the previous administration, including a criminal tax investigation into President Biden’s son, Hunter, and a special-counsel probe examining the origins of the FBI’s 2016 Russia investigation.<br />Mr. Biden has said he would defer to his attorney general on how to handle those inquiries, as well as on any decisions the department makes about whether to prosecute former President Donald Trump for offenses such as his alleged incitement of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by rioters trying to block confirmation of Mr. Biden’s win last November. Mr. Trump’s lawyers and allies have denied he incited the riot, and the former president was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial.<br />Judge Garland would supervise, as well, the historic antitrust case against  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google—the biggest such lawsuit in decades—filed by the department last fall, alleging the tech giant used anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly position in search and search advertising. Google denies the allegations.</td>

      <td>Tragedy marked the writer’s early life, but his career has been a celebration of the gifts of intellect and freedom.</td>
      <td>Simon Gray once marveled at the manifold successes of his fellow-playwright Tom Stoppard. “It is actually one of Tom’s achievements that one envies him nothing, except possibly his looks, his talents, his money and his luck. To be so enviable without being envied is pretty enviable, when you think about it.” Mr. Stoppard, now aged 83, has never taken that luck for granted. He’s had a long string of West End, Broadway and Fringe hits, four Tony Awards, an Oscar, several Oliviers, the Order of Merit and countless other honors; he is widely considered Britain’s greatest living playwright. But this triumphant tale had its origins in tragedy and dislocation, as we find in “Tom Stoppard: A Life,” by the empathetic, meticulous biographer Hermione Lee (author of previous lives of Virginia Woolf, Edith Wharton and Penelope Fitzgerald).<br />Mr. Stoppard was born in 1937 as Tomáš Sträussler in Zlín, Czechoslovakia, where his father Eugen worked as a doctor in a hospital run by the Bata shoe company, the gigantic corporation for which Zlín was the company town. When the Nazis entered the country in 1939 the hospital director arranged foreign visas for the Jewish doctors, including Eugen Sträussler. So Eugen, Marta and their two small boys, Petr and Tomáš, decamped to Singapore, where Eugen continued his work as a Bata physician.<br />This refuge lasted only two years, until the Japanese invasion. Marta and the boys got out safely but Eugen was killed when his ship was attacked. The remaining three Sträusslers fetched up in India, where they stayed four years, much of the time in Darjeeling where Marta worked in a Bata shop. Here Tomáš, aged 4, attended a boarding school at a house named Arcadia (a word that would re-emerge as the title of perhaps his best-loved play) and learned English. In 1945 Marta married a British Army officer, Maj. Kenneth Stoppard, who brought his bride and her sons back to England. They were to become, to all appearances, a wholly British family; the boys were renamed Peter and Tom Stoppard, the mother Bobby.<br />Ken Stoppard, the boys later realized, was anti-Semitic and xenophobic, and so Bobby did her best to bury her past—not so much in submission as in an effort to give her sons everything good that life might offer them. She ardently believed in the oft-mocked formulation of Cecil Rhodes, that “to be born English was to win first prize in the lottery of life”—a sentiment Tom would come to agree with. Bobby and her sons had not been born English but wished to become so, and to this end she concealed from the boys their Jewish background and the fact that all four of their grandparents and three of their aunts had died in the Holocaust, keeping her own trauma to herself. And Tom flourished in his new life. He was sent to an idyllically rural prep school. “At the age of eight,” he says, “I fell in love with England almost at first glance, never considering that the England I loved was, in the first place, only a corner of Derbyshire, and, in the second place, perishable.” Ken taught him “to fish, to love the countryside, to speak properly, to respect the Monarchy.” He played good cricket and was a boy scout.<br />The young Stoppard appears to have been too restless for academic success; his teachers noted a lack of “singlemindedness.” He left school at 17, eschewing higher education to work as a journalist in Bristol, where he landed a job on the Western Daily Press. It turned out to be a good move: Bristol’s cultural scene, in the 1950s, was animated, and Ms. Lee’s evocation of it provides us with a lovely piece of social history. With a journalist’s access, Mr. Stoppard discovered new worlds: “law courts, local government, theatre backstage, boxing matches, crime scenes, in fact ‘all of human life’ as the News of the World used to say.”</td>

      <td>Setting out to understand Russia from the outside, an author journeys through the cultures at its margins.</td>
      <td>In the summer of 1648, we learn a few pages into Erika Fatland’s “The Border,” a Cossack named Semyon Dezhnev embarked on an eastward mission to inform the fur-trapping nomads of the Siberian steppe that they were, in fact, subjects of the Russian czar, and to demand taxes (usually furs) accordingly. A skilled diplomat, effective in a job that was equal parts revenue collection and colonization, Dezhnev headed further and further east until, at last, he hit the then-unmapped strait that separates Russia from North America. Within a generation, though, his journey was forgotten, and in 1728 the strait was named after a later “discoverer,” the Danish cartographer Vitus Bering. Today, the larger of the strait’s two islands, Big Diomede, is considered to belong to Russia; the smaller, to Alaska. They are divided by a sound about 3 miles across, and the International Date Line runs down the middle. “In winter,” Ms. Fatland tells us, “when the sound is frozen, it is in theory possible, though of course strictly forbidden, to walk from the U.S.A. to Russia, from yesterday to tomorrow.”<br />There are stories like this aplenty in “The Border” (or, to use its full title, “The Border—A Journey Around Russia: Through North Korea, China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Norway, and the Northeast Passage”). Officially, the book is a travelogue-cum-cultural history, tracing the author’s journey across the 14 countries bordering the world’s largest country. (Of them, only the author’s native Norway was never occupied by Russia.) In practice, however, the book is a hauntingly lyrical meditation to the contingencies of history, the sheer arbitrariness of dividing lines and border posts, of namesakes forgotten and remembered, of successful and unsuccessful wars. Ms. Fatland sets out, she tells us (via Kari Dickson’s archly smooth, British-inflected translation), “to understand a country and its people from the outside, from the perspective of its neighbours,” to identify a quintessential “Russianness” through an investigation of the often-liminal spaces of its periphery.<br />The question, of course, has a political valence. The Russian self-imagination—as a “world in its own right,” one “neither European nor Asian, nor anything in between”—is at the heart not just of centuries of colonial expansion but also of the current geopolitical order. The Putin-era revival of the age-old idea of Moscow as the “third Rome”—as both the religious and imperial heart of modern Christianity, unsullied by such suspicious Western exports as liberal democracy and homosexuality—is inextricable from the wider narrative of Russian exceptionalism, used to justify everything from crackdowns on LGBTQ “propaganda” to political intervention in Crimea.<br />What Ms. Fatland succeeds in doing, to the book’s credit, is both greater in scale and more intimate than her stated aim. Through a series of slickly told, vignette-style chapters, moving from the uncanny valley of North Korean package tours to drunken revelry in the Georgian mountains, Ms. Fatland offers less an account of Russianness than of its subversion: a polyphonic vision of often-arbitrary identities, histories and voices. The idea that we can speak meaningfully about capital-h History comes across, in Ms. Fatland’s wry telling, as faintly absurd: Her interest is less in grand narratives than in, for example, a Kazakh woman’s decision to put German instant coffee into a Russian coffee tin, or the domestic dramas—over stolen household goods—that tear apart the elderly remaining residents of Pripyat, site of the Chernobyl disaster. The closest we get to an image of Russianness, as a national abstract, is “Russian Style Town,” an amusement park in Harbin, China, complete with scattered geese, bored-looking folk dancers, a vodka shop, and a concession selling Putin matryoshka dolls. There Ms. Fatland meets an elderly Russian woman who, unable to survive on her pension back home, makes a living as “local color”: Wearing full babushka garb, she poses for photos with tourists, for tips.<br />“The Border,” then, is less about monistic identity than its impossibility. The state-imagined Russia gives way to the diverse panoply of human beings who exist in dialogue with it, each with his own distinct and richly rendered understanding of his place in the world. It’s about Oleg and Victor, Russians who, while crowing about Russia’s superiority to other nations, snort that St. Petersburg and Moscow aren’t really Russian (too European), but neither is the Caucasus (“definitely not”). It’s about Aragalan, an ethnically Tuvan reindeer herder in Mongolia, who tells Ms. Fatland: “My wife is Mongolian, my children are Mongolian. The only thing that distinguishes me from other Mongolians is that I live in a lavvu and herd reindeer. And I don’t speak Mongolian very well.” If there is a common factor to experience, it is a shared sense of the arbitrariness of history: that any border could easily be moved, that any monument could easily be named for someone else.</td>

      <td>A writer goes in search of her forebears, but finds ‘too much past’ to tell the story straight.</td>
      <td>The Moscow-born writer Maria Stepanova reflects that she has been working on her book “In Memory of Memory” (New Directions, 432 pages, $19.95) since she was 10 years old, when she made the first abortive attempts to chronicle the story of her ancestors. As part of this lifelong obsession she has surrounded herself with their handed-down diaries, photographs and belongings and committed to sifting their contents for revelatory discoveries. Yet the work has always been coupled with a tinge of embarrassment. Despite being Russian Jews during a century of extreme tumult, her ancestors seem to have led resolutely ordinary lives, “well beyond the reach of the textbooks and their footnotes, in a place where all we can see is swirly-patterned wallpaper and an ugly old yellow butter dish, which survived its owner and the old world, and even the twentieth century.”<br />The hybrid book that Ms. Stepanova has finally produced presents gleanings from her family archives alongside the labyrinthine narrative of her “search for the past,” which she concedes is incomplete and in many ways unsuccessful. And amidst the personal artifacts are essay-like meditations on the tensions that inhere within any act of remembrance. The result is a rich, digressive, deeply introspective work that reminded me of James Agee’s “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men” in its tortured eloquence and unflinching self-scrutiny.<br />“There is too much past, and everyone knows it,” she writes at a moment of sharpened despair. The surplus means that memories are necessarily invidious and sorted into two sets, “the interesting and the less interesting,” those “fit for retelling and those . . . only fit for oblivion.” A fanatical, itemizing approach to history can help overcome prejudice, but even the most straightforward documentary material becomes distorted across time. In one searching chapter, Ms. Stepanova explores her love and distrust of photographs, which she thinks bring about “euphoric amnesia,” stimulating emotions that bear no relation to what the pictures originally signified.<br />A dialectic emerges in these omnivorous inquiries into artists and ideas. For every W.G. Sebald, whose novels are filled with painstaking historical inventories, there is an Osip Mandelstam, who believed that memory is “inimical,” an obstacle to experiencing the present. In Judaism, Ms. Stepanova writes, remembrance is a sacred duty; yet the word “dybbuk,” for a malign spirit in Jewish folklore, means “clinging to” and suggests the monstrous effect of being haunted by the past.<br />You can sense the decades of contemplation Ms. Stepanova has dedicated to these questions in the sparkle and density of her prose, which Sasha Dugdale has carried into English so naturally that it’s possible to forget you are reading a translation. This is an erudite, challenging book, but also fundamentally a humble one, as it recognizes that a force works on even the most cherished family possessions that no amount of devotion can gainsay. “Objects falling out of currency slowly lose their defining qualities and turn a new nonhuman face toward us,” Ms. Stepanova writes. “They return to the materials from whence they came, wax, paint, and clay. The past rewilds itself, oblivion springs up out of it like a forest.”</td>

      <td>For investors, that ‘gut feeling’ can be more powerful than they realize. Here’s how to listen to your gut without being ruled by it</td>
      <td>If only financial markets came with traffic signals: indisputable indicators of when it is safe to keep going, when you need to slow down, when you must stop. Imagine how much easier investing would be if you could rely on such green, yellow or red lights.<br />Unfortunately, these unambiguous signals don’t exist. Investors fill much of the absence with anecdotes and gut feelings, which can be more powerful than you realize. Such soft indicators can help you make hard decisions, but only if you rely on them in the right ways.<br />Consider the anecdotal feel of today’s markets.<br />Bitcoin’s price rose above $50,000 this week. Dogecoin, a digital currency intended as a joke, is up more than 1,000% in 2021. Margin debt, borrowed money that brokerage customers use to juice their trading, is up 42% from a year ago, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. For the week ending Feb. 12, bullish options bets by small traders ran at a near-record 16 times the average for the past two decades, calculates Jason Goepfert of Sundial Capital Research, a Minneapolis firm that tracks market sentiment.<br />On the other hand, the Federal Reserve expects to keep firehosing money into the economy and to hold interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future. That pushes the return on safe assets so low that they feel worthless to hold, shoving investors into riskier choices. Vaccines are reaching millions of people, and new coronavirus cases are falling fast, fueling hopes for a quicker and stronger economic recovery.</td>

      <td>In a booming oil town during the tumult of revolution and after, memories of beauty and suffering.</td>
      <td>When Umm El-Banu Assadullayeva, later called Banine, was just 12 years old, she became a multimillionaire. But “only for a few days,” she wryly recalls, “for I was soon woken at dawn by ‘The Internationale’ sung in the street.” The year was 1917 and the Red Army had arrived in Baku, Azerbaijan, the oil-rich Caucasus region where Banine’s family had become immensely wealthy (her grandfather bequeathed her those millions) and where intrusions—by the Russians, the Turks, the British, the Russians again—were as common as bloodbaths. In the year of Banine’s birth, for example, she notes that “it was the better-organized Armenians who were exterminating the Azerbaijanis in revenge for past massacres, while the Azerbaijanis made the best of it by storing up grounds for future slaughter.” And throughout childhood, she and her friends mimicked the mayhem. “On holidays we played at massacring Armenians,” the author recalls of summers by the sea, “a game we loved above all others. Heady with racist passion, we would sacrifice Tamara”—a timid companion—“on the altar of our ancestral hatred.”<br />The youngest of four daughters, Banine was born during the pogroms of 1905, and her mother, having fled the killings, died shortly afterward. Her father was later imprisoned under the Bolshevik regime, and in order to secure his subsequent passage to Europe, Banine, at age 15, married a man of influence whom she detested. These are just some of the tribulations running through “Days in the Caucasus,” a memoir, first published in 1945 and now keenly translated from the French by Anne Thompson-Ahmadova, which spans the tumultuous period from the author’s birth to 1924. Reflecting an era of bloodshed and terror, it should be a grim read. Instead, however, this account is an effervescent and irreverent feat of recollection and imagination—epic in sweep yet intimate in tone—that introduces the reader to an exotic, antique world and to characters so vividly drawn that their raucous voices seem to echo long after they have vanished from sight.<br />“We all know families that are poor but ‘respectable,’ ” the memoir begins. “Mine, in contrast, was extremely rich but not ‘respectable’ at all.” Playfully mirroring Tolstoy, Banine could be ushering us into a capacious 19th-century novel. And in a way she is. For what follows is a captivating drama of family, money, marriage and disaster that unfolds with deceptive ease and irresistible charm, thanks to the agility of a narrator who is both innocent girl and ironic observer. Recalling her German governess, for example, Banine writes: “She hoped to see us turn into Gretchens with delicate figures and easy sighs. But our forebears were keeping watch. Under their guidance, our hips fleshed out, our noses grew longer, our breasts swelled . . . and down, soft at first but quietly turning into thick hair, covered us in dark shadow.”<br />Pale governesses, pianos, culture: in the prewar years all emanated from Germany. Banine’s father even sported a Kaiser Wilhelm moustache (that monarch having endeared himself as a “protector of Islam and the Turks”). But the arrival from Moscow in 1915 of a refined young stepmother introduced Banine and her sisters to more varied European tastes. An English and a French governess deposed loyal Fräulein Anna while the works of Shakespeare and Maupassant supplanted Teutonic “sweet songs for blond children.” Banine’s wider world, enriched by oil fortunes, was already lively and relatively enlightened. (The first secular school for Muslim girls opened in Baku in 1901; the first opera in the Muslim world was performed there in 1908; newspapers thrived.) And the region’s enduring Russian presence, at first imperial then revolutionary, also influenced the girl’s consciousness, not to mention breaking her teenage heart when she fell in love with an ardent Bolshevik commissar. “To live is to be intense, passionate,” Andrey, her moody “prince” declares as he proposes elopement. “We will burn brightly together.” But Andrey runs away with Banine’s scandalous cousin instead, leaving our desolate heroine to marry the politically connected suitor who bears “a striking resemblance to an earthworm.”<br />Weightier events are recounted in a wonderfully dry tone reminiscent at times of Chekhov’s letters or of those sublimely droll novels of Eastern adventure such as Rose Macaulay’s “The Towers of Trebizond” (1956). Banine observes that during World War I “the Turks restored calm in Baku by hanging some poor wretch almost every day.” Peace, on the other hand, brings “talk of an independent Azerbaijan, Armenia, Karelia, Kazakhstan, and I don’t know what else: Independent, Autonomous, Proud, Free and Happy. Epithets accompanied by Republics and Republics combined with epithets rained down on the astonished peoples.”</td>

      <td>Thrift is in a bear market as even the riskiest borrowers rush to issue new debt. That world may not last forever.</td>
      <td>When money is readily available and almost free, why bother saving for a rainy day?<br />For corporations, the question is worth asking at a time when dollars might as well be falling from the sky. The average rate on so-called “high yield” bonds recently fell below 4% to a record low. In the late 1990s, even corporate borrowers with the best reputations paid average interest rates on the order of 7%. There is so much money looking for a place to go that companies are being contacted by investors asking if they would like to issue bonds rated below investment grade rather than the other way around.<br />It is a seller’s market for all manner of risk. While the 10 year U.S. Treasury Note yield has been edging higher since the summer, interest rates have mostly been in decline for decades. Policy makers at the Federal Reserve and other major central banks have indicated that major changes are unlikely anytime soon. Government rescue of private enterprises facing insolvency, once an unthinkable intervention, has become somewhat commonplace. As the Clovers once sang, though not about monetary policy, “your cash ain’t nothin but trash.”<br />The sentiment isn’t quite universal, though.<br />“We take a lot of pride in the Triple-A credit rating, and we see it as a potential competitive differentiator,” says Joseph Wolk, chief financial officer at  Johnson & Johnson ,  which is one of only two U.S. firms remaining with that sterling designation. Prudence helped the company, founded in 1886, survive two world wars, the Great Depression and other calamities.</td>

      <td>Selected by Selina Hastings, the author, most recently, of ‘Sybille Bedford: A Life.’</td>
      <td>By Diana Souhami (1998)<br />1. One of the most famous trials in London during the interwar years involved the writer Radclyffe Hall, who in 1928 shocked conventional society with the lesbian theme of her novel “The Well of Loneliness.” Viciously attacked by the editor of the Sunday Express—“I would rather give . . . [a child] a phial of prussic acid than this novel”—the work was eventually judged obscene and all copies of the book ordered to be destroyed. Devastating as this was, the case gave Hall, or “John,” as she was known among her friends, a celebrity she relished. Wealthy, arrogant and notoriously short-tempered, Hall dressed as a man, in a suit and tie, with her hair cropped short, cigar usually in hand. Diana Souhami describes with perspicacity and wit the life Hall led with her devoted lover, Una Troubridge. Ensconced in luxury in London, with a large staff and a chauffeur-driven Daimler, the two holidayed across Europe. They remained together nearly 30 years, despite Hall’s final affair with a young Russian woman, deeply resented by Una, who had to wait for Hall’s death before she could take her revenge.<br />By Gertrude Stein (1933)<br />2. It was in September 1907 that two expatriate Americans, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, met in Paris, where they remained, living happily together for nearly 40 years. While Stein, clever, vigorous and eccentric, became highly regarded as a writer, running a salon popular among the city’s avant-garde, Toklas remained shyly in the background, working devotedly as Stein’s lover, secretary, editor and cook. Stein’s account of this period, teasingly presented as though written by Toklas, is a mischievous and highly perceptive impression of life in the artistic world of the Left Bank. Among the many characters in Stein’s inner circle was Picasso, in appearance like “a good-looking bootblack,” as well as Braque, Matisse, Hemingway and T.S. Eliot. “The geniuses came and talked to Gertrude Stein and the wives sat with me,” records the fictional narrator. During World War I, the two women undertook voluntary work with American forces, which they enjoyed: “Gertrude Stein always said the war was always so much better than just going to America.” Although Toklas is presented as modest and self-effacing, Stein’s wicked wit is never far from the surface, one of the reasons this book would make her name.<br />By Sybille Bedford (1968)</td>

      <td>The new biotechnology called CRISPR offers the prospect of defeating lethal viruses and curing genetic diseases, even as it raises serious moral questions</td>
      <td>In the spring of 2014, Jennifer Doudna had a nightmare.<br />The Berkeley biochemist had helped to invent a powerful new technology that made it possible to edit the human genome—an achievement that made her the recipient of a Nobel Prize in 2020. The innovation was based on a trick that bacteria have used for more than a billion years to fight off viruses, a talent very relevant to us humans these days. In their DNA, bacteria develop clustered, repeated sequences (what scientists call CRISPRs) that can recognize and then chop up viruses that attack them. Dr. Doudna and others adapted the system to create a tool that can edit DNA—opening up the potential for curing genetic diseases, creating healthier babies, inventing new vaccines, and helping humans to fight their own wars against viruses.<br />But Dr. Doudna’s nightmare didn’t concern these happy prospects. In it, she was asked to meet someone who wanted to learn about CRISPR. When she entered the room for the meeting, she recoiled: Sitting in front of her was Adolf Hitler with the face of a pig. “I want to understand the uses and implications of this amazing technology you’ve developed,” he said.<br />Four years later, He Jiankui, a young Chinese scientist who had attended some of Dr. Doudna’s conferences, used CRISPR to create the world’s first designer babies: twin girls whose DNA had been edited when they were embryos to remove a gene that produces a receptor for the virus that causes AIDS. There was an immediate outburst of awe, and then shock. Arms flailed, committees convened. After more than three billion years of the evolution of life on this planet, one species (us) had developed the talent and the temerity to seize control of its own genetic future. We seemed to have crossed the threshold into a whole new age, perhaps a brave new world, summoning up images of Adam and Eve biting into the apple or Prometheus snatching fire from the gods.<br />Our newfound ability to edit our own genes raises fascinating—and troubling—questions. Should we alter our species to make humanity less susceptible to deadly viruses? That seems like a wonderful boon, especially amid the pandemic. And what about trying to get rid of deafness or blindness? Or being short? Or depressed? And if such remedies are possible and safe, why not go farther and allow parents to enhance their children, giving them higher IQs, stronger muscles, greater height, and a preferred hue of skin and hair?</td>

      <td>Glimpses of magic and mystery in origin stories from a panoply of cultures.</td>
      <td>Once upon a time, a Hopi story goes, Spider Grandmother spun the web that created humankind. In the Guarani tradition, the father of gods and men created himself within a cosmos of fog. A tale from the Nahua peoples tells of a storm-god emerging from the ocean as a star-spangled jaguar.<br />These are some of the origin stories told in “The Sea-Ringed World” (Levine Querido, 230 pages, $21.99), a collection of ancient sacred tales for readers ages 8-14 drawn from native cultures throughout the Americas. Written by María García Esperón, translated by David Bowles, and illustrated with arresting blue, black and white digital pictures by Amanda Mijangos, the stories have a dual quality of immediacy and remoteness: Moments of sharp clarity seem to wink amid great stirring clouds of hidden meaning.<br />In “Golden King,” for instance, a story from the pre-Columbian Muisca civilization, a king demands that a wizard retrieve his drowned wife and son, alive, from a fathomless lake. Closing his eyes, the wizard sees the beautiful woman sitting on an emerald throne, while the prince in her lap plays with a golden disc. “Your wife and your son are now gods beneath the waters,” the wizard says. “As such they ask you to institute a ritual: offerings of gold and emeralds.” But there is yet greater sacrifice: “You must offer yourself.” The story ends with the king daubing himself in resin and gold dust, raising his arms to the sky “like a resplendent human bird” and plunging to a willing death. Evocative and stirring, the stories in “The Sea-Ringed World” are mesmerizing to read aloud, though parents will want to brush up on their pronunciations before embarking. Names such as Ix Chebel Yax and Kookyangwso’wuuti are easier to say on the fly when you’ve checked the glossary first.<br />From modern-day Japan come seven enchanting vignettes involving a young dreamer in “Sato the Rabbit” (Enchanted Lion, 59 pages, $17.95), by Yuki Ainoya. Our hero in this compact little picture book (translated by Michael Blaskowsky) is a boy who wears a rabbit costume and sees all sorts of wonderful possibilities in the world. While watering the garden, he imagines—as we see in a beguiling painting—that a distant pond is “blowing water into the hose as hard as it can.” Noticing the sunset reflected in a puddle, Sato the Rabbit lifts up its rosy surface, like a luminous manhole cover, and finds himself transported to the sky. In another story, Sato cracks walnuts and discovers tiny loaves of bread and a pot of hot coffee inside one set of shells, a miniature bed and steaming bath inside another. The soft lines and delectable colors of Ms. Ainoya’s pictures, and their charming details (the walnut bath has a loofah and a little towel rack), will have 4- to 8-year-olds wishing they could climb into Sato’s world. Their parents may wish it, too.<br />Most of us will never get to see the northern or southern lights in person. These solar phenomena produce vast colored curtains in the night sky, but they’re viewable only from the top and bottom of the world. So the pleasures of “Seeking an Aurora” (Blue Dot, 32 pages, $17.95) are likely to be vicarious for most readers ages 3-7. Written by Elizabeth Pulford and illustrated by Anne Bannock, both New Zealanders, this quietly thrilling picture book chronicles the late-night excursion of a father and child. Having tiptoed through the house to avoid waking the rest of the family, the pair steps into frosty rural darkness: “Outside everything was still. Even the dogs were quiet, and the cows looked like prehistoric creatures, their noses streaming smoke.”</td>

      <td>The Greek comedian wasn’t afraid to challenge the powers that be. Or crack a dirty joke.</td>
      <td>The study of the languages and literature of ancient Greece and Rome—a discipline once considered so foundational it was simply known as “the classics”—has been under siege for decades. University enrollments in all humanities programs have declined; programs, especially in the classics, are imperiled. The idea of a Western canon deriving from the ancient world has been challenged by some left-wing educators even as it has been taken up by right-wing ideologues: its condition as a political football makes the field’s existence all the more fragile.<br />Although the times seem to be changing, the classics are still relevant today, perhaps more so than ever. “The glory that was Greece” comes in many flavors, shades, and accents. Students are often first introduced to its martial and tragic side. But, more than Homer or Sophocles, Aristophanes, the oldest of the comic playwrights, may be the man for our current moment. When political posturing and empty rhetoric cloud the air, the most vulgar hilarity feels like an antidote: Buffoonery and slapstick, ribald invective, and the sort of comedy that turns on farts and erections all provide a welcome respite—and in the hands of Aristophanes are powerful tools to help us see our problems afresh.<br />George S. Kaufman famously observed that “satire is what closes on Saturday night.” To which we may add that comedy is the most fragile and time-sensitive of all genres. Like the funnybones of audiences, jokes change, losing their zing through time. What survives? Broad strokes, dramatic situations and stock characters that can be accessed centuries after their first appearance. Many of today’s problems—war and peace, patriotism and xenophobia, sexual and power relations, gender issues—were around 2,500 years ago.<br />Seeing a play on stage is one thing, reading it quite another. The intellectual wit of Oscar Wilde—all that epigrammatic cleverness—does not require a mise-en-scène. Other kinds of comedy do. Luckily for us, Aaron Poochigian has re-animated Aristophanes, in glittering translations of four of his most 21st-century-appropriate plays. It will be interesting to see whether directors bring these versions to life.<br />In addition to their topical relevance—educational schemes, feminist plots, utopian visions, antiwar invectives—Aristophanes’ plays are virtually impossible not to translate well. They inspire their modernizers, encouraging flights of fancy. I once asked the late translator William Weaver whether working on Umberto Eco’s “The Name of the Rose” was difficult. “No,” he said, “because Umberto was so Rabelaisian in his linguistic extravagance that he welcomed all indulgence in the hands of his collaborators.” The same could be said for Aristophanes.</td>

      <td>The story of a spy who gets a second chance keeps its cards close to the vest.</td>
      <td>Alek Garin, the title character in Paul Vidich’s edgy espionage novel “The Mercenary” (Pegasus, 274 pages, $25.95), is a former CIA agent living in Greenwich Village in 1985. He accepts sporadic Agency work in the wake of a priority assignment blown to smithereens six years ago. (He failed to exfiltrate a KGB officer from Moscow.) Now the Agency wants Garin to try again, this time with a defector who insists Garin is the only person he’ll deal with. “Life rarely offers second chances,” Garin’s CIA contact tells him. “Don’t squander this one.”<br />Garin takes the assignment and joins the staff at the Agency’s Moscow Station with the cover job of “Consular Officer, Human Rights.” He meets with the defector (code name: GAMBIT) and learns why he demanded Garin, who “lost” a previous KGB veteran. “For me—and for you,” says GAMBIT, “it’s our lives. KGB officers don’t survive two failures, and I think the CIA is the same. . . . I trust a man who has as much to lose as I do.”<br />At first, “The Mercenary” seems an outstanding example of a familiar sort of spy saga. But there’s more to Alek Garin than most people know. Where did he learn to speak Russian? Why is his accent so odd? Family and professional secrets are revealed only gradually. We remain unsure how this conflicted character will fare in a Moscow full of political factions and Agency turncoats. “He’ll get GAMBIT across,” insists Garin’s superior. But at what cost?<br />Alex Berenson’s “The Power Couple” (Simon & Schuster, 421 pages, $28) features Rebecca and Brian Unsworth; she heads the FBI’s Russia counterintelligence desk, he’s a coder for the NSA. The demands of Rebecca’s high-pressure job have lately taken a toll on her husband and two teenage children: “Her workday left her barely enough time to be a mother or a wife.” Brian feels he’s become a mere supporting player in the movie of his wife’s life: “the spouse who shows up in a couple of scenes to humanize the lead character.”<br />But wife and husband are united in common cause when their 19-year-old daughter Kira is abducted in Barcelona during a family vacation. Rebecca pulls strings to get assistance from FBI contacts, and local authorities also help out. Was Kira grabbed at random or targeted because of her parents’ work? Mr. Berenson, a veteran storyteller, succeeds quickly in getting the reader to care about his main characters.</td>

      <td>The story of a family’s bifurcated fate shines a light on the history of postwar literature.</td>
      <td>Among the cultural figures who fled Hitler’s Germany to the United States—writers, artists, playwrights and movie makers, among others—there was one who, without quite the celebrity of some of his fellow émigrés, would find himself expanding the horizons of American book publishing. “Publishing is both a business and an art,” Kurt Wolff wrote in a letter from 1958. It demanded, he said, “the whole man, the whole life.”<br />Wolff himself never set down his own “whole life.” He was probably too modest or discrete. “What one can write is not interesting,” he once said about the possibility of writing his memoirs, “and what is interesting one cannot write.” Now his grandson, Alexander Wolff, offers an event-filled biography and, along the way, a captivating case study in the challenges faced by refugees attempting to remake a life. For “Endpapers,” Mr. Wolff, a longtime reporter for Sports Illustrated and a former journalism professor at Princeton, describes his approach as “an amalgam of history, journalism, and memoir.”<br />Kurt Wolff was born in 1887 in Bonn, Germany; his father, we learn, was Protestant, his mother Jewish by birth and Christian by baptism. After marrying Elisabeth Merck, whose family ran a major pharmaceutical company, Kurt Wolff launched his career in publishing, founding a firm in Leipzig before World War I. Blessed with an exceptional feel for the literary ferment of the time, he published writing by Joseph Roth, Heinrich Mann, Robert Musil, Max Brod, Franz Werfel, Karl Kraus, and (in German translation) Sinclair Lewis.<br />Lewis called Wolff “one of the most intelligent and promising publishers I have ever met.” Another of Wolff’s authors, Franz Kafka, was less impressed. “He is a very beautiful man, about 25,” he noted in a letter from 1913, having met Wolff in Leipzig the year before, “whom God has given a beautiful wife, several million marks, a pleasure in publishing, and little aptitude for the publishing business.” Even while serving in the trenches of the Western Front, Kurt continued to solicit and read manuscripts, including Kafka’s “The Metamorphosis,” which he brought out during the war.<br />In the Weimar years, as his marriage disintegrated, Wolff’s firm was hit by hyperinflation—one of its novels carried a five-million-mark price tag—and by the economic crash of 1929. Physically and fiscally spent, he was forced to shut his doors in 1930. His patronage of writers the Nazis would soon designate as “degenerate” didn’t help. In February 1933, he listened to radio reports of the Reichstag fire together with his fiancée and soon to be second wife Helen Mosel, whose exceptional literary discernment had driven her rise in the firm from unpaid intern to full-fledged editor of its art-book division. “These are madmen,” Kurt told her. “Pack!” Two days later, the couple fled Germany and would spend the next six years as refugees shuttling between Italy and France. With the outbreak of war in September 1939, they were designated as “enemy aliens” and sent to various French internment camps. As Wolff reported in a letter: “Eighty percent of my production was burnt by the Nazis and my publishing house put on a blacklist.”</td>

The Duchess of Sussex will also lose appointments including her patronage of the National Theatre.<br />“While all are saddened by their decision, The Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family,” the palace said.<br />A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said they remained committed to their duty and service to the U.K.</td>

      <td>Dogo Onsen, among Japan’s oldest bathhouses, still has unquenchable star power. Plus five other of the country’s most beloved hot springs and ryokans to book on your post-pandemic trip.</td>
      <td>For the Time Capsule series, we spotlight a cherished restaurant, hotel or landmark that’s changed remarkably little over the years. This week, we visit Dogo Onsen in Japan.<br />Legend has it that 3,000 years ago an injured white egret healed herself in springs—or onsen—burbling up beneath Shikoku, the smallest of Japan’s four main islands. The 8th-century Nihon Shoki, Japan’s oldest text, describes visits to those hot springs, later known as Dogo Onsen, by monks, princes and samurai lords who marveled at its therapeutic powers. Eventually, the wild springs were sheltered under wooden bathhouses, with separate sections established in 1635 for samurai, commoners and even, further downstream, horses. At the end of the 19th century, Dogo Onsen had fallen out of favor among the well-scrubbed elite until the local mayor, Isaniwa Yukiya, campaigned to dramatically renovate it. The new iteration emerged as a three-story spa castle complete with showy Japanese Baroque flourishes on the exterior and Mediterranean touches like marble, statues of deities and tile-work mosaics inside. Cheerleaders of Dogo’s comeback included 19th-century poet Masaoka Shiki, who popularized both baseball and haiku (and baseball haikus).<br />A 20-minute tram ride from Matsuyama city, Dogo Onsen became a popular international pilgrimage site after its wave-shaped gable inspired the design of the haunted bathhouse in the 2001 anime film “Spirited Away.” In the film’s wake, the onsen began drawing about 800,000 visitors a year. Unlike the outdoor baths found across Japan, Dogo is housed entirely inside. Guests, in cotton robes and socks, tiptoe through its warren of creaky hallways or slide open rattling glass doors to discover tatami-matted lounges with moon-shaped windows, an ideal place to sit and sip tea after a soak. The Imperial bath, with its gold- and silver-leaf shoji screens, is reserved for the emperor’s exclusive use, though visitors can catch a glimpse if they book a tour. In 2019, a seven-year refurbishment of Dogo’s upper floors began, but the two baths downstairs remain open even in the pandemic—with more rigorous cleaning and social-distancing rules in place. Admission costs $4; local mikan orange soap will cost you 50 cents extra (dogo.jp/en). Dogo Onsen’s nearby annex, opened in 2017, offers a replica of the Imperial bath, where even commoners can book a private soak.<br />Five other favorite onsen destinations around Japan<br />1. Nearly 3,000 hot-spring vents populate Kyushu’s onsen mecca, Beppu, which dates to the 8th-century. Regulars know to seek out the rustic rotemburo (outdoor bath) with thatched huts, hidden atop a hill in the city’s east. From about $6 a person for the day, yuno-hana.jp</td>

      <td>Despite a threadbare ad budget, the French brand was the best performer in the luxury industry last year</td>
      <td>Even with no place to go to flaunt their purchases, wealthy shoppers kept the tills ringing at  Hermès  during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Axel Dumas, the chief executive officer of the French maker of $10,000 Birkin and Kelly handbags, said Friday that sales at constant exchange rates fell 6% in 2020 compared with a year earlier. Competitors LVMH Moët Hennessy  Louis Vuitton  and Gucci-owner Kering both recently reported more severe declines of 16%. Hermès also had the best fourth-quarter performance across the luxury sector to date. The brand’s shares were up 6% in early European trading.<br />In hard-hit categories where many of its competitors are struggling, Hermès has bucked trends. Sales of the company’s watches increased by 28% in the fourth quarter.  Compagnie Financière Richemont ,  which makes Swiss watch brands Officine Panerai and Jaeger-LeCoultre, said sales at its specialist watchmakers division dropped 4% over the same period.<br />The growth is striking considering Hermès has one of the stingiest ad budgets in the industry, spending just 5% of its sales on marketing. Most of this goes on live events rather than media campaigns. Less desirable luxury brands need to plow up to one quarter of their turnover back into marketing to maintain sales growth.<br />So far, Hermès hasn’t resorted to the kind of aggressive price increases that other brands used during the pandemic to offset weaker volumes. Louis Vuitton lifted prices on certain handbags by up to 6% in May last year, according to Jefferies data. At closely owned Chanel, its best-known handbag is now around one-fifth more expensive globally than it was at the end of 2019. Hermès’s management said it would only increase prices by around 1% in 2021 to offset the cost of higher wages.</td>

      <td>In a new book, the former head of the once-mighty company admits he made mistakes but argues he faced ‘bad news almost every day’</td>
      <td>In the summer of 2001, weeks before Jeff Immelt became CEO of  General Electric ,  he was playing golf with friends at a country club near Chicago when a club member asked him what he did. “I work for  GE , ” Mr. Immelt replied, omitting his title. “Ah, GE! Jack Welch!” the man said. “I feel sorry for the poor son of a bitch who’s taking his place.”<br />The late Jack Welch was indeed a tough act to follow. The man dubbed the “manager of the century” by Fortune magazine quintupled the company’s revenues and increased shareholder returns 70-fold during his tenure from 1981 to 2001. At its 2000 peak, GE’s market capitalization soared to $600 billion.<br />Twenty years on, GE is a husk of its former self. The nearly 130-year-old conglomerate has shed some $500 billion in value and almost half its global workforce. Its profits have plunged, its stock has tumbled, and it recently paid $200 million to settle with the Securities and Exchange Commission over claims that it misled investors. GE has sold off many of its businesses, and it has cut its dividend to a token penny a share—a stunning fall for a one-time market leader in everything from lightbulbs to jet engines. Many point fingers at Mr. Immelt, 65, who led the company for 16 years until he was nudged out in 2017.<br />“It became clear right away that my main role would be Person to Blame,” Mr. Immelt writes in his new book “Hot Seat: What I Learned Leading a Great American Company,” which will be published Feb. 23. While he admits he made mistakes, he says he felt moved to write about his years at GE’s helm to highlight the often-dire context of his decisions. “I dealt with bad news almost every day,” Mr. Immelt says over Zoom from his home on Kiawah Island, off the coast of South Carolina.<br />Despite Mr. Welch’s hallowed legacy, Mr. Immelt says that many of GE’s problems were inherited. “I’d become CEO of a company where perception didn’t equal reality,” he writes. GE’s shares were overvalued, high returns from its pension funds inflated earnings, and the company relied too heavily on its financial division, GE Capital, which contributed nearly half the firm’s earnings in 2001 by loading up on debt and becoming overleveraged in the insurance business.</td>

      <td>A rush of cash into a leveraged volatility note might only pay off if disaster strikes the rest of the stock market</td>
      <td>GameStop mania may be over, but the ripples continue weeks later as newly minted retail traders flirt with various objects of affection. There were silver, marijuana stocks and dogecoin. Some observers are now pointing to an exchange-traded product that tracks volatility as a likely beneficiary of crowd behavior.<br />The  ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF ,  which carries the ticker symbol UVXY, might be the worst investment of them all because it isn’t really meant to be one.<br />“These products are expected to go to zero,” said Scott Nations, an expert on options and volatility and president of Nations Indexes.<br />The fund has been around since 2011, but swelled this week to its largest value ever, more than $2.5 billion in assets. This is despite the fact that its price has dropped by more than 99.99% over that time, sending about $5 billion of investors’ cash to money heaven. The fund gives investors 1.5 times exposure to futures contracts on the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX. That index reflects how choppy purchasers of options on the S&P 500 think the market will be over the following month.<br />At the moment, those futures are sharply in contango, which means prices are higher for more distantly expiring ones. While the VIX itself is fairly elevated now at about 22, futures contracts expiring in March are above 25 and those expiring in April are at about 28. To maintain their objective, owners of volatility ETFs effectively are daily sellers of the cheaper contracts and buyers of the more expensive ones, steadily eroding their value.</td>

      <td>Unusual hiring alliances created by U.S. businesses in 2020 are now bearing fruit.<br />When pandemic-related shutdowns devastated some industries and turbocharged others last spring, dozens of employers joined forces to match idled workers with open jobs. Companies with urgent staffing needs in industries such as healthcare, grocery and e-commerce formed large-scale matchmaking partnerships with companies in hard-hit sectors such as hospitality, retail and airlines to recruit workers who had been furloughed or laid off<br />Almost a year later, the partnerships have matched many tens of thousands of workers with open jobs, according to several companies involved in them. And labor specialists say they could be a model for future hiring alliances among employers.<br />“It’s really a very promising practice,’’ says Jane Oates, head of the nonprofit WorkingNation and an assistant secretary in the Labor Department during the Obama administration. “This strategy will outlast Covid-19,” she says, as it likely will take at least three years for the U.S. to regain lost jobs.<br />CVS Health Corp. formed hiring partnerships with 64 U.S. employers—including Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and Gap Inc.—as it raced to fill open positions in its stores, warehouses and call centers amid a coronavirus-fueled surge in its business last year. The pharmacy and insurance giant created dedicated hiring websites for its partners’ displaced workers and streamlined the selection process for some jobs. Of the more than 100,000 people whom CVS recruited from March to December last year, about 3,700 came from the new partnerships, according to a spokeswoman.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—Lawmakers from the U.K. and Canada criticized  Facebook Inc.’s  ban on Australian users sharing news articles, and they said the tech giant could attract more scrutiny around the world as authorities grow increasingly concerned about its market power.<br />Facebook removed news from its platform in Australia in response to legislation that would effectively compel it to pay traditional media companies for content. The Australian legislation, supported by media companies including News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co., has been widely watched globally and could offer a model for other countries that want to require big tech companies to pay publishers for their content.<br />Facebook previously warned that it could remove news if the legislation progressed, but its announcement still caught many Australians by surprise. Users in Australia woke up Thursday morning to find that the Facebook pages of Australian and international publishers appeared blank. Those who tried to post news links got a message saying the post couldn’t be shared. The tech giant also removed the pages of some government agencies, which it later said was inadvertent.<br />In the U.K., Julian Knight, the lawmaker who chairs the digital, culture, media and sport committee, tweeted that Facebook’s move was deeply irresponsible. The news blackout also called into question Facebook’s commitment to be a good global citizen, he said in the tweet.<br />“Australia is the canary in the coal mine now as far as social-media legislation is concerned,” he said.</td>

He was seen as heir apparent after serving as point man on Honda’s alliances with General Motors and Chinese battery maker  Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd.  He has worked on both electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles. The company has said two-thirds of its sales will be in those categories by 2030.</td>

Ms. Meng asked the court in London, where HSBC is based, to obtain documents that her lawyers said would prove she didn’t mislead the bank.

      <td>Oil-and-gas producers coming out of bankruptcy could be tempted to grow aggressively again with today’s higher prices</td>
      <td>Shale companies’ debts have been forgiven. Will investors forget?<br />Former drilling giants are testing their footing in the public markets after a near record number of reorganizations in 2020. It was the second-largest year for oil-and-gas producer bankruptcies—measured by debt volume—since the law firm Haynes and Boone started tracking the numbers in 2015.<br />Chesapeake Energy ,  once the second-largest natural-gas producer in the U.S., started trading on the Nasdaq last week as a shell of its former self: Its market capitalization is roughly $4 billion, a little over a tenth of what it was at its peak.  Whiting Petroleum  and  Oasis Petroleum  emerged from bankruptcy in late 2020, also at fractions of their heyday valuations. Their shares are up 59% and 65%, respectively, since they started trading after emerging from bankruptcy.<br />Their re-entry is well timed with oil prices back to pre-pandemic levels: U.S. benchmark oil prices are now more than $10 a barrel higher than what it costs an average U.S. producer to profitably drill a new well, and natural-gas prices are back above the $3 per million British thermal units mark, buoyed by cold weather.<br />Yet prime conditions can be a slippery slope for a boom-and-bust industry prone to drilling too much when prospects look up. The temptation is especially high when capital is easy to raise, as it is now with investors hungry for yield. While not many energy companies have tested the waters with new equity issues, plenty of investors are interested in buying existing shares: A broad basket of exploration and production companies have fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Borrowing is easy, too. Demand is sky-high for riskier bonds, a bucket that many energy companies’ debt falls into.</td>

They have also launched drones and missiles against a nearby military base and Jeddah’s international airport, which the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen said had been intercepted.<br />New disclosures about the incidents show the limits of Saudi Arabia’s defenses and the expanding reach of the country’s foes, even though none of the incidents have produced significant casualties. Although the kingdom’s military capabilities have improved in recent years, current and former U.S. officials say Saudi Arabia still has much work to do to better integrate its radars, Patriot batteries, short-range air defense guns and F-15 jets into an effective defensive system.<br />They also point to the difficulties of stemming attacks by Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, which continue to present a security threat despite vows by Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi to rein them in.</td>

But the economic backdrop is quite different.<br />To illustrate just how frenetic India’s market has become, compare it with other emerging markets dependent on oil imports. In U.S. dollar terms, the benchmark MSCI equity indexes for Indonesia, Turkey, the Philippines and Thailand are down by between 7% and 12% relative to their levels at the beginning of 2020.<br />India’s performance in fighting Covid-19 isn’t enough to justify such a wide gap: The International Monetary Fund estimates that a full recovery for India won’t come until some time in the first half of 2022. That’s faster than Thailand due to the latter’s dependence on international tourism, but slower than Indonesia, which should reach pre-pandemic levels of gross domestic product this year.<br />As in many places, more speculative forms of trading activity have surged: Turnover from proprietary investors reached its highest levels since 2009 in January, up more than 160% from a year earlier.</td>

But few of these investors are swearing off Chinese private markets, where they still hope to reap big returns.<br />Shock waves rippled through the investment world when China halted the initial public offering of Ant, which would have been the world’s biggest. The decision was signed off by President Xi Jinping after controlling shareholder Jack Ma infuriated government leaders by criticizing government financial regulation in an October speech, The Wall Street Journal reported.<br />For the past several years, the retirement savings of America’s police, firefighters and teachers have increasingly found their way to private companies in China such as Ant. Anxious to meet ambitious return targets in a low-yield world, large North American pension funds have committed growing sums to both global private-equity managers active in China and managers local to China, according to pension officials and their advisers and investment reports.<br />This has contributed to a larger boom in Chinese deal making for U.S. institutional investors. Private-equity-backed deals of $300 million or more in China involving exclusively U.S.-based investment managers totaled nearly $13 billion between 2010 and 2019, according to Preqin data. Deal activity peaked in 2018 at $3.78 billion. For investors and investment managers world-wide in 2020, private-equity investment in internet and technology in China was $52 billion, according to consulting firm Bain & Co.<br />In the wake of the Ant decision, some of the appointed bureaucrats and local union leaders who make up state pension boards across the U.S. have found themselves increasingly fretting over the sensitivities of Chinese government officials. But so far, they have decided not to make any major changes.</td>

Chinese authorities declined to give the WHO team raw data on these cases and potential earlier ones, team members said.<br />In examining 13 genetic sequences of the virus from December, Chinese authorities found similar sequences among those linked to the market, but slight differences in those of people without any link to it, according to the WHO investigators. The two sets likely began to diverge between mid-November and early December, but could possibly indicate infections as far back as September, said Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist on the WHO team.<br />This, and other evidence, suggest the coronavirus might have jumped to humans sometime during or shortly before the second half of November, she said, sickening too few people to attract attention until it led to an explosive outbreak in Wuhan. By December, the virus was spreading much more widely, both among people who had a link to the market, as well as others with no tie.</td>

He has implemented programs to make equity awards and provide financial-literacy training at the industrial companies the firm owns, including  Ingersoll Rand Inc.,  a pump and compressor maker, formed in 2020 through a roughly $9 billion merger with Gardner Denver Holdings Inc., a KKR investment.<br />Mr. Stavros, 46 years old, is now raising money to launch a nonprofit he plans to call the Center for Shared Ownership, to which he and his wife are pledging $10 million of their savings, he said. The organization will focus on providing companies with resources to help them adopt employee-ownership programs, funding academic research and potentially pushing for new government incentives.<br />Giving ownership to lower-level employees better aligns their interests with those of management and shareholders, makes them more engaged and creates a stronger culture, Mr. Stavros said. And at a time when rising inequality has led to populist uprisings and geopolitical instability, awarding shares to blue-collar workers can lead to greater social cohesion by helping lower earners—many of whom are racial minorities—build wealth, he said.<br />The wealthiest 10% of Americans owned $26.6 trillion of equities in 2020, an increase of more than 15 times since 1989. That compares with just $178 billion and an eightfold increase for the bottom 50%, according to Federal Reserve data.</td>

      <td>Semi-retired senior judges are stepping up to take on full criminal case loads, as every filing is watched closely</td>
      <td>D.C. DISTRICT COURT is flooded with cases from the Capitol riot, leading semiretired judges to take on full criminal case loads and thrusting usually-obscure magistrate judges into high-profile hearings whose every filing is watched closely by the public and news media. “The three Magistrate Judges of this Court are very experienced in managing voluminous workloads, and they have teamed together to address the recent surge in cases arising from the events on January 6th,” said Beryl Howell, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in D.C.<br />The court has 15 judges, three magistrate judges—who typically handle duties such as applications for arrest warrants, preliminary hearings and setting bail—and seven senior judges, who have stepped back from their full duties but continue to take cases on a reduced basis. Usually, just one magistrate judge a month has criminal duty, but the court has added a backup duty slot to deal with the crush from the riot. The situation is made worse by the fact that the D.C. district has the worst judges-to-magistrates ratio of any district in the country and has long relied on magistrates from other courts to help share the burden.<br />“Even before the January 6 attack on the Capitol, the criminal case load in D.C. had grown, but the sudden and substantial increase in cases in the six weeks since represents another order of magnitude,” said Jessie Liu, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom who was U.S. Attorney for D.C. from 2017 to 2020.<br />Cases will eventually be dispersed to the Senate-confirmed judges in the district and to judges who have taken on senior status, many of whom have volunteered to take on as many cases as active judges.<br />Because senior judges are stepping up to handle the influx, it is unlikely that Judge Emmet Sullivan, who has announced he will take senior status in April, would have to change his plans. “I plan to be as active as always,” Sullivan wrote in his notice letter to President Biden earlier this month.</td>

      <td>Investors intrigued by bitcoin’s surge but reluctant to buy it have some options for how to bet on the evolution of banking and payments. But they’re not cheap.</td>
      <td>Digital currencies have the attention of the mainstream. Even America’s oldest bank can’t ignore them.<br />Bank of New York Mellon ,  founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, announced last week it will help clients hold and transfer bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That followed an announcement from Tesla that the electric car maker purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. The combined excitement generated by two well-known companies likely played a role as the price of bitcoin hit $50,000 for the first time.<br />Many investors may justifiably feel that buying bitcoin or other tokens directly as a way to tap into this momentum is too speculative or volatile. But it may be time for even the crypto-agnostic to start thinking about getting exposure to the emerging ecosystem around bitcoin and other digital assets—not necessarily for the value of those assets themselves, but how finance and banking might evolve because of them.<br />After all, many longtime crypto proponents are already looking well past bitcoin as digital gold toward other developments, such as the use of crypto in commerce, lending and payments. The shape of this future is hazy: Bitcoin itself could be a major component, or it might be alternatives like so-called stablecoins pegged to dollars, or digital currencies issued directly by central banks.  Mastercard  said this month it plans to support some cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins, directly on its network.<br />For shares of big global institutions like Bank of New York or Mastercard, it could still be some time before crypto can move the needle more than macro factors like interest rates or consumer spending. So investors for now may be looking for more concentrated or direct exposures. There is a growing roster of listed companies that provide “pick and shovel” services across cryptocurrency and digital assets—though they aren’t cheap.</td>

      <td>Business surveys point to a further acceleration in manufacturing output, even as many service providers see continued declines</td>
      <td>Factories in Europe and Japan reported a faster pickup in activity during February, even as service providers saw deeper declines, reflecting the increasingly selective impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on global economic activity.<br />High infection rates at the turn of the year prompted governments in Europe and Japan to impose fresh restrictions on individuals and businesses. But in contrast to the early months of the pandemic, manufacturers have continued to recover, even as businesses offering services that traditionally require close physical proximity have seen fresh contractions.<br />February surveys of purchasing managers indicate that divergence became more pronounced, particularly for economies such as Japan and Germany that have long been big exporters of manufactured goods.<br />The strength of factory output augurs well for the speed of the global economic recovery later in the year, when vaccination programs that are already under way should enable those parts of the services sector that are now closed or severely restricted to recover.<br />“Assuming vaccine rollouts can boost service sector growth alongside a sustained strong manufacturing sector, the second half of the year should see a robust recovery take hold,” said Chris Willaimson, chief business economist at  IHS Markit ,  which conducts the surveys of purchasing managers.</td>

China had been silent on casualty figures until Friday, when it announced posthumous awards for the four soldiers.<br />As it made the announcement, China laid the blame on India, saying that its troops had “deliberately provoked incidents” by trying to “unilaterally change the status-quo of border control,” according to the PLA Daily, its main military publication.<br />Tensions remained high for months between India and China, which share a 2,000-mile border. They pointed fingers at each other for starting the fight, saying the other side was breaking established rules and boundaries for troop movements.<br />According to Indian officials, the violence started after Indian soldiers arrived in an area of the Galwan Valley on the border, to ensure that Chinese forces had decamped as part of an agreement struck between the two sides. They found that Chinese soldiers remained and had started building a new structure on what India considers its side of the de facto boundary. That sparked an argument, which led to the bloody clash.</td>

      <td>OTTAWA—Canada on Thursday weighed changes to criminal-sentencing laws that the country’s attorney general argued would address systemic racism in the justice system.<br />The proposed changes include the repeal of mandatory minimum sentences on all drug convictions and some firearm convictions, such as unauthorized possession and use of certain weapons in situations not linked to organized crime. Judges would be free to issue a sentence they deem appropriate under the circumstances. The government also will require police and prosecutors to consider other measures for simple possession of drugs, such as compulsory addiction-treatment programs.<br />Currently, mandatory minimum penalties for drug and some firearm convictions are between one to four years in prison. Convictions for simple possession of drugs carry penalties of fine, and possible prison time of six months to up to seven years, depending on the type of narcotic and other circumstances.<br />The changes are part of a broader push by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this year toward a more progressive agenda in areas such as social spending and the environment.<br />The proposed changes come as violent crime is on the rise in Canada, but is still well below the levels in the U.S. Incidents of violent crime such as assault and robbery rose in 2019 from the previous year by 11%, according to Statistics Canada’s most recent data. Offenses related to firearms were among the biggest increases. Homicides account for 0.1% of all violent crimes, and Canada’s murder rate is 1.8 per 100,000, versus the U.S. level of 5.</td>

However, the company generates the bulk of its revenue by selling ads on streaming channels and taking a share of the streaming service’s subscription revenue and ad inventory. The ad business has boomed as marketers, following their customers, are shifting more toward digital media.<br />The company’s total revenue rose to $649.9 million in the fourth quarter, up from $411.2 million a year earlier. Revenue at Roku’s platform business, which includes ad sales, jumped 82% to $471.2 million.</td>

      <td>He was a gifted entertainer and advocate, but in his later years certain flaws became more evident.</td>
      <td>I meant to talk about something else this week, but my thoughts keep circling back to Rush Limbaugh. His obituaries in the mainstream press were mostly judgment, no mercy. It’s not nice when malice gets a final, unanswered shot. On the conservative side, TV commentaries were cloying to the point of cultish. It gives a sense of horror to see people who are essentially cold enact warmth of feeling.<br />So here I give Rush without tears, and I guess the subtext has to do with the words “the base” in both a broad and narrow sense.<br />He was a remarkable figure, a phenomenon. At his height he was the most powerful radio personality since Walter Winchell, who rose in the 1930s after radio’s beginnings. Limbaugh helped save radio and certainly saved the AM band by pioneering a new form, the national conservative call-in show. This spawned an entire industry. Most important, he created a community—an actual community of, at his height, tens of millions of people who thought along with him every day and through that thinking came to feel less lonely, less like outsiders in their views. When Limbaugh came on the scene, conservatives had gotten good at electing presidents, but were largely left out of the national conversation on the airwaves.<br />To create a community of tens of millions of people in fractured, incoherent America was an astounding feat. To pretty much sustain it over 30 years was equally astounding.<br />It is perhaps ironic but probably inevitable that that community was created by a man whom one of his closest friends this week called “an isolate.” Knowing him slightly over a few decades, I believe the most important thing to him was his profession, his show—three hours a day, five days a week, unscripted, with sound elements and callers. Preparation was all-consuming. He had to be constantly plugged in, staying on top of the news, monitoring opinions, settling on the one he’d put forward. Three hours of live performance takes everything you have.</td>

      <td>The Biden Treasury has a plan to dodge Congress on IMF aid.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s first G-7 meeting Friday is teed up as the launch of his “America is back!” tour. We wonder if he’ll boast about Treasury’s plan to finance the largest share of an International Monetary Fund dump of $1 trillion into the global economy—without Congressional approval.<br />The official Treasury line is that it wants to work with international financial institutions to help “low-income countries who are struggling to respond to the pandemic.” Sounds nice until you look under the hood. What you see is a plan to use the IMF to subsidize mostly rich and middle-income countries, leaving the poor with little.<br />The vehicle is a new IMF allocation of “special drawing rights,” or SDRs. Don’t let the alphabet arcana mislead you. This is about real money, and the U.S. will foot the biggest bill. Created in 1969, SDRs were meant to settle international accounts if the supply of available gold was inadequate for supporting trade and growth. That problem never materialized, and when the gold-exchange standard was abandoned in 1973, this “paper gold” lost its raison d’être. SDRs have since been reinvented as a tool of international income redistribution.<br />When member nations want to use these paper credits—today worth about $1.44 each—they have to convert them into hard currency. Those seeking dollars bring their SDRs to the U.S., which has an obligation to exchange them for greenbacks. The country that converts the SDRs into dollars has to pay interest at the IMF, making the transaction the rough equivalent of a note with a coupon set at the three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate. Except the money never has to be paid back.<br />Past SDRs allocations total 204 billion—worth about $290 billion. But that’s pocket change for Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who says “the time to go big is now” and the IMF target is $1 trillion.</td>

      <td>NASA’s newest rover offers inspiration and soft power at a bargain.</td>
      <td>The landing of NASA’s newest Mars rover lacked the explosive visuals of its launch last July, but there’s nothing so stirring sometimes as the cheers of anxious relief from behind the glowing computers at mission control. A journey of 293 million miles ended around 4 p.m. Thursday, when the craft’s descent stage used a “sky crane maneuver” to lower the rover its final stretch to the surface.<br />That feat will probably be repeated this weekend by more than a few youngsters who can find enough LEGO bricks. But don’t be deceived by the scale: The Perseverance rover is 10 feet long and seven feet tall. Here on Earth it weighed 2,260 pounds, although in Mars’s weaker gravity the scale would read more like 866 pounds.<br />Oh, and the rover carries a helicopter with four-foot rotors, setting up mankind’s first Kitty Hawk moment on another planet, one with an atmosphere that’s only about 1% the thickness of Earth’s.<br />Perseverance’s mission is to poke around the Jezero Crater, a basin in Mars’s northern hemisphere that’s about 28 miles wide. NASA says the crater might have been a lake the size of Lake Tahoe, fed by a river that formed a delta, 3.5 billion years or so ago. The rover will scan for organic molecules and drill rock samples for a future return to Earth. Maybe someday Elon Musk can pick them up on his way home.<br />NASA says the mission has cost about $2.4 billion so far, which these days is a rounding error for the federal government. But NASA is also the kind of discretionary program that could come under increasing pressure as entitlement spending gobbles up ever more of the federal fisc. Mars exploration is worth doing for its own sake, to push back the veil of ignorance about a planet that was known to the ancient Egyptians and seen through a telescope by Galileo.</td>

      <td>His own pollster shows why he became a one-term President.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump launched a personal attack on Mitch McConnell this week after the Senate GOP leader called the former President “practically and morally responsible” for the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Mr. McConnell doesn’t need our defense, but we hope GOP voters aren’t buying Mr. Trump’s attempt to rewrite the history of the 2020 election.<br />Mr. Trump’s statement didn’t claim that he won the election, but it did begin to burnish the result by taking credit for every GOP victory while boasting that he “received the most votes of any sitting President in history, almost 75,000,000.” Joe Biden still beat him by more than seven million votes.<br />As important is why he lost, and for that look no further than Mr. Trump’s own pollster, Tony Fabrizio. His firm’s post-election analysis was first reported by Politico, but it’s worth resurfacing for Republicans to ponder.<br />Mr. Fabrizio looked at data from exit polls and AP’s VoteCast in 10 highly competitive states that Mr. Trump won in 2016. Mr. Trump lost five of them in 2020—Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin—while winning Iowa, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas a second time.<br />One stunning conclusion: Mr. Trump lost even though the electorate was more Republican in 2020 than in 2016. Mr. Fabrizio reports that Mr. Trump lost “largely due to a massive swing” among independents and erosion among Republicans. This helps explain how the GOP gained a dozen seats in the House even as Mr. Trump became the first President to lose re-election since George H.W. Bush.</td>
