      <td>The Girl Scouts perceived a grave threat from the Boy Scouts and tried to steer parents away from coed programs, documents show</td>
      <td>In May 2017, ahead of a meeting of the Boy Scouts of America’s top leaders, a Girl Scouts of the USA employee emailed a counterpart at the Boy Scouts to ask about speculation it was considering admitting girls into the historically boys-only programs.<br />For worried Girl Scouts executives, the reply was heartening. The Boy Scouts were discussing how to make their programs more accessible to families, but the organization still valued single-gender programs and wanted to “avoid any confusion that there may be consideration of coed scouting,” a Boy Scouts executive said in reply to the inquiry. The chief executives of both youth groups also spoke by phone, and the Girl Scouts came away reassured, according to internal emails released through litigation last month.<br />Even before these exchanges, the Boy Scouts were running focus groups on how to appeal to girls, reviewing market analytics and forming a team to consider possible retaliation from the Girl Scouts in the event the organizations turned against each other, according to internal emails filed in federal court. At the time, Boy Scouts executives were debating the merits of raiding the Girl Scouts’ youngest members for recruits, court filings show.<br />“Be aggressive, move faster and give a lot of serious thought to Girl Scout actions and be prepared to take them out,” one unnamed Boy Scouts executive wrote in a May 2017 message. The Girl Scouts would be upset, the executive wrote, but added, “We will prevail!”<br />The push within the Boy Scouts to recruit girls came as it faced an increasing threat of legal exposure over past failures to protect boys from sexual predators in the volunteer ranks. Lawsuits from abuse survivors were piling up, and states including New York, California and New Jersey were moving closer to suspending statutes of limitations on abuse claims, allowing victims to sue institutions like the Boy Scouts regardless of when the alleged misconduct occurred. The Boy Scouts have said the organization believes victims and is “deeply sorry for the abuse suffered because perpetrators used our program to harm innocent children.”</td>

      <td>Some nurses and other industry employees remain hesitant; officials are concerned because of their influence</td>
      <td>Efforts to disseminate Covid-19 vaccines as widely as possible are hitting an unexpected obstacle: health-care workers who decline the shots.<br />Officials from Ohio said recently that 60% of nursing-home staff so far haven’t elected to take the vaccine. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this month that state officials expect 30% of health-care workers offered the vaccine will ultimately turn it down. Two-thirds of the staff at a Florida hospital refused the vaccine this month, leaving so many unused doses that the facility started giving away shots to the general public.<br />The hesitancy among health-care workers concerns public-health officials who expected America’s front-line workers to serve as a model for others.<br />“Please get vaccinated,” Anthony Fauci, who is serving as President Biden’s chief medical adviser for the Covid-19 pandemic, said in a video message to health-care providers. “It’s important to protect yourselves, to protect your family, but as important, symbolically, as health-care providers, to show confidence in the vaccine so that other people in this country follow suit.”<br />In a survey of 1,563 respondents conducted in January by researchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation, 79% of U.S. adults who haven’t yet been vaccinated say they would be likely to turn to a doctor, nurse or other health-care provider when deciding whether to get a vaccination.</td>

In three days, many of these stocks gained more than most do in a decade. The hedge funds on the other side of these bets lost billions.<br />This movement is the culmination of nearly five decades of the democratization of markets set off by none other than the late founder of Vanguard Group, Jack Bogle.<br />For all the hyperventilating over this week’s financial revolution, though, investors should regard it as the latest phase in a long evolution—and unlikely to disrupt markets overall.<br />Still, this is a remarkable moment. It’s as if a bunch of couch potatoes watching a Los Angeles Lakers basketball game on TV belted down their beer and nachos, barged onto the court—and proceeded to block LeBron James’s shots and mercilessly dunk on Anthony Davis.</td>

      <td>In Personal Board of Directors, top business leaders talk about the people they turn to for advice, and how those people have shaped their perspective and helped them succeed. Previous installments from the series are here.<br />Sally Grimes landed her dream job last year when she became Clif Bar & Co.’s CEO. Taking the helm in the midst of a global pandemic tested this seasoned food-industry executive.<br />When she arrived at the company in June, her employees were already weary of juggling child care from home while trying to keep factories free of any coronavirus outbreaks. She also had to confront soft demand for snack bars—the pandemic curtailed visits to convenience stores, airports and other places where people typically purchase Clif’s products—as well as heightened competition from rivals.<br />“Early on in my career, I had the feeling that I had to be the smartest person in the room coming out of business school and that led to some mistakes,” she said. Since then, she said she learned a key lesson: “Humility is not the opposite of confidence. It’s the freedom for learning.”<br />The CEO grew up outside of Chicago. Her interest in brand management and the food industry began while she was a student at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business in the late 1990s. A lecture from a Kraft Foods executive piqued her interest, and she went on to get a job there. She was on the Kraft team that came out with Easy Mac, the first microwavable macaroni-and-cheese cups.</td>

      <td>Traders and politicians are making new, risky arguments about low interest rates to justify their actions</td>
      <td>The Wall Street bulls embracing sky-high stock values and the Washington pols embracing big deficits may be ideological opposites, but they have something important in common. Both draw sustenance from near-zero interest rates which make stocks more valuable and debt more supportable. And both risk taking this basically sound logic to extremes.<br />The rally in everything from big tech stocks to  Tesla Inc.  to bitcoin are all manifestations of what Wall Street calls “TINA” for “there is no alternative”: when bank deposits pay nothing and government bonds next to nothing, investors will grasp at almost anything in search of a return.<br />Directionally, this is not wrong. The value of an asset is its future income, discounted to the present using interest rates, plus a “risk premium”—the extra return you expect for owning something riskier than a government bond. A declining interest rate or risk premium boosts the present value of that future income.<br />This can certainly justify some of the market’s rally. The ratio of the S&P 500 to expected earnings has jumped from 18 in 2019 to 22 now, lowering the inverse of that ratio, the “earnings yield,” from about 5.5% to 4.6%. That happens to closely track the decline in the 10-year Treasury yield from 1.9% to around 1%. Low rates also help explain the outperformance of big growth companies like  Apple Inc.  and  Amazon.com Inc.,  for whom the bulk of profits lie far in the future.<br />Has this gone too far? In a blog post Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, worked out the intrinsic value of the S&P 500 assuming bond yields at 2% over the long run and an equity risk premium of 5%. The result: The S&P on Friday was roughly 11% overvalued.</td>

      <td>Manufacturers including  Whirlpool Corp.  and  Polaris Inc.  said their ability to meet increased demand for their products remains hampered by supply constraints and safety measures taken to protect workers amid the coronavirus pandemic.<br />People are buying long-lasting goods like exercise equipment, boats and camping gear at record levels. Normally, manufacturers would raise production to meet such demand. But doing business during the pandemic remains challenging, companies said during recent quarterly updates.<br />Many manufacturers continue to suffer from inventory shortages, a remnant from when plants were closed last spring. In addition, measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19, such as adding space between workers, are weighing on production. As a result, manufacturing backlogs hit a two-and-a-half year high in December, according to the Institute for Supply Management.<br />Slowdowns are compounding along supply chains, from ports to warehouses to factory floors, leading to higher costs. “You are seeing logistic costs going up, trucking costs going up, airfreight going up,” 3M Co. Chief Executive Mike Roman said in an interview.<br />Whirlpool said Wednesday that adding space between workers had slowed appliance output. Chief Executive Marc Bitzer said Whirlpool’s suppliers were experiencing the same drag. The company said some appliances would be in short supply until at least halfway through 2021.</td>

      <td>Hundreds of hours of work went into this season’s boldest fashions. WSJ. picks the top looks from the Spring 2021 couture shows.</td>
      <td>The spring 2021 couture season came to a close this Thursday, and though we’re still sequestered at home viewing the collections on screens, there was plenty to be inspired by. For his Valentino couture collection, Pierpaolo Piccioli created pared-back, even cozy-looking options for spring, in striking contrast to the epically proportioned, floating white gowns the label showed last season. He incorporated what some might consider loungewear, though the element of couture was not lost on a single stitch. One look features a yellow turtleneck finished with the ateliers signature budellini embroidery and a beige cashmere coat intricately woven with Lurex fringe. Sterling Ruby, too, focused on knitwear for his S.R. Studio. LA. CA. collection. A pair of denim trousers printed with images of the engines of American hot-rods was paired with a braided handknit sweater that felt suitable even for staying at home. Other collections had us dreaming of things we’ve had to put on hold this past year. At Chanel, Virginie Viard created a make-believe wedding day complete with a satin bridal gown as the finale. For her  Christian Dior  haute couture collection, Maria Grazia Chiuri upheld a sense of escapism with a collection inspired by tarot arts. A standout look with a striking gold brocade cloak was called the High Priestess, a tarot symbol of stillness and reflection. Valentino and Fendi both sprinkled men’s looks into their couture collections this year, marking a shift to gender neutrality that has been bubbling up from the ready-to-wear runways. Though these collections won’t reach anyone’s wardrobe until late spring, their debut brings a sense of optimism and opportunity to the start of the year. Below, we’ve chosen our 14 favorite looks from the season.<br />A lace mesh gown glistens with 180,000 silver pearls.<br />Mink slippers embroidered with glass pearls complete a taffeta marbled suit.<br />A relaxed ensemble is electrified with Lurex fringe outerwear.<br />A men’s look celebrates the understated side of couture.</td>

      <td>U.S. is catching up but most countries are way behind; Britain alerted world to new variant</td>
      <td>LONDON—Every week across the U.K., a fleet of courier trucks ferries chilled waste material from half a million Covid-19 tests to a genome-sequencing facility in Cambridgeshire, eastern England.<br />The daily operation is part of a Covid-19 surveillance system that has made the U.K. the world’s leading sequencer of the coronavirus genome and helped it to spot a more contagious, and possibly more deadly, variant of the virus that in most countries would have long gone unnoticed.<br />Viral sequencing—producing a kind of bar code for the virus—has in recent months emerged as crucial in the global hunt for versions of the pathogen that are better adapted to infect humans, evade vaccines and possibly to kill. Virus variants first identified in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil have provoked concern among experts.<br />The variant the sequencers uncovered in the U.K., which is now the dominant variety in the country, has a mutation that appears better able to bind onto human cells. Studies suggest it is 50% more transmissible than the previous prevalent variant while other research suggests it could be at least 30% more deadly.<br />New viral variants are more likely to be spotted in the U.K. than anywhere else. As of Jan. 29, the U.K. had submitted 44%, or around 190,000, of the genomes held in a global library run by the nonprofit Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, or Gisaid. That is around 5.1% of the nearly four million cases detected in the U.K.</td>

      <td>Governing coalition faces internal dissension; leftist Vice President Cristina Kirchner opposes spending cuts</td>
      <td>With Argentina broke, Finance Minister Martín Guzmán is pushing for a deal by May with the International Monetary Fund to repay $44 billion in debt. To win the IMF’s acquiescence, he’ll narrow a yawning budget gap, he said in an interview on Friday.<br />It is the traditional path that Argentina, which has defaulted nine times on sovereign debt, has taken when its economy has hit rock bottom, as it has now during a punishing pandemic that led to a 10% economic contraction 2020. But Mr. Guzmán said his plan falls short of the draconian austerity measures the IMF imposed with other governments.<br />“We are using the negotiations with the IMF as an opportunity to try to break with the patterns of the past,” said Mr. Guzmán, a Columbia University-trained economist.<br />The twist this time around is that Mr. Guzmán and President Alberto Fernández both belong to a party that has long railed against the IMF, blaming it for Argentina’s problems. And they face a formidable opponent within the governing Peronist coalition that is marshaling lawmakers against the IMF’s belt-tightening policies.<br />Vice President Cristina Kirchner, leader of a far-left faction, calls for strong state intervention and public spending to preserve the purchasing power of Argentine workers, a policy that marked her two terms as president.</td>

      <td>The progressive press decides that dissenters should be suppressed.</td>
      <td>Most Americans learn in school about flagship political excesses in U.S. history like Joe McCarthy’s 1950s inquisitions, the post-World War I Red Scare and the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. Yet a recent Washington Post opinion piece purports to explain “what the 1798 Sedition Act got right.”<br />The law banned a wide range of political speech and publication. It was passed by the ruling Federalists to suppress the rival Democratic-Republicans, whom they saw as seditious. The Post piece argues that though their solution was “flawed,” the Federalists had reason to worry about “unregulated freedom of the press.”<br />We highlight this as one example among many of the emerging appetite for viewpoint suppression among journalists, intellectuals and Democrats in the wake of the Trump Presidency. They increasingly see domestic enemies wherever they look, and are devising ways to use levers of power to restrict, regulate and boycott opposition. It’s an extraordinary and ominous turn in a democracy.<br />Many calls to sanction opposition media come from voices that claimed to be most alarmed by Donald Trump’s attacks on the free press. Margaret Sullivan, the Post’s media columnist, wrote this week that “corporations that advertise on Fox News should walk away,” declaring that the outlet’s “role in the 400,000 U.S. lives lost to the pandemic and in the disastrous attack of Jan. 6” has been “deadly.”<br />Nicholas Kristof of the  New York Times  called for “pressure on advertisers to withdraw from Fox News so long as it functions as an extremist madrasa.” He added that “cable providers should be asked why they distribute channels that peddle lies.” A CNN writer asserted that providers like  Comcast  “have escaped scrutiny and entirely dodged this conversation.” By conversation he means political bullying from the left.</td>

      <td>The Biden team shows no gratitude to the man who sped up the Covid shots.</td>
      <td>Johnson & Johnson  and  Novavax  this week reported that their vaccines were effective in clinical trials, and what fortunate timing. The U.S. urgently needs a supply boost. But at this juncture it’s also worth noting how former Operation Warp Speed chief Moncef Slaoui positioned the Biden Administration for a vaccine triumph.<br />One of Mr. Slaoui’s inspired ideas was to diversify the federal government’s vaccine bets with six manufacturers when nobody knew which, if any, would work. The vaccine candidates used different technologies—Moderna and  Pfizer -BioNTech (mRNA), J&J and  AstraZeneca  (adenovirus), and Novavax and  Sanofi -GSK (recombinant protein).<br />The J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines were hobbled by trial delays in the fall. But J&J reported Friday that its vaccine was 66% effective at protecting people from moderate to severe disease in a global trial, and 85% against severe illness. Early trial data from AstraZeneca suggests similar efficacy. Novavax reported Thursday its shot appears to be nearly 90% effective.<br />The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are about 95% effective, so it’s fortuitous that their trial results came first so their shots could inoculate the elderly and others most at highest risk. But even if somewhat less effective, the other vaccines may be good candidates for young people and boost supply this spring.<br />Operation Warp Speed removed the financial risk for drug makers by financing trials and manufacturing in advance so vaccines could roll out as soon as they are approved. This is the reason some 20 million Americans have already been inoculated. President Biden this week ordered another 200 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna to be delivered this summer.</td>

      <td>Beijing retaliates after Britain offers refuge from growing tyranny.</td>
      <td>To its eternal credit, the British government is honoring its promise to its former colonial subjects by offering a path to citizenship for Hong Kongers who hold British National (Overseas) passports and their family members. The need for such refuge became clearer on Friday as China retaliated by announcing that China will no longer recognize BN(O) passports as a valid form of identification or travel documentation.<br />For now Hong Kongers who want to leave can still use their Hong Kong passports unless there’s a warrant out for their arrest or bail restrictions. But Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian warned that China “reserves the right to take further measures.”<br />Hong Kongers fear Beijing could soon impose restrictions on the movement of money or assets. At the request of police, HSBC froze the bank accounts of pro-democracy lawmaker Ted Hui, who escaped abroad in December. Pro-Beijing lawmaker Regina Ip recently suggested that China should consider using “its nationality law to disallow dual nationality,” so Hong Kongers who flee may never be able to return. China could also restrict Hong Kong refugees’ freedom of movement by pressuring other countries to refuse to recognize BN(O) passports.<br />Meanwhile, the atmosphere in Hong Kong grows more stifling by the day. Earlier this month Hong Kong police arrested more than 50 former lawmakers and dissenters. Pro-democracy district councilors and lawyers are likely the next targets. Pro-Beijing lawmakers have also called for schools to install surveillance cameras in classrooms to ensure teachers aren’t making “subversive remarks” during lessons.<br />The message is clear: Hong Kong may become a place you can’t escape. So it’s a shame that last month Sen. Ted Cruz blocked legislation that would have made it easier for Hong Kongers to gain refugee or temporary protected status in the U.S. The Biden Administration has a chance to do better by the cause of freedom by following Britain’s excellent example.</td>

      <td>A FISA judge gives a former FBI agent a slap on the wrist.</td>
      <td>How can the American people take the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court seriously when it doesn’t do so itself? That’s our view of Friday’s sentencing of former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith, who admitted to falsifying evidence submitted to the court for a warrant to spy on onetime Trump foreign-policy adviser Carter Page.<br />Federal Judge James Boasberg spared Mr. Clinesmith prison in favor of 12 months probation and 400 hours of community service. The judge said the evidence persuaded him that “Mr. Clinesmith likely believed that what he said about Mr. Page was true.”<br />In their brief, prosecutors made clear how unlikely this is. The evidence of Mr. Clinesmith’s animus toward Donald Trump is considerable. As for being an honest mistake, remember that Mr. Clinesmith changed an email confirming Mr. Page had been a CIA source to one that said the exact opposite, explicitly adding the words “not a source” before he forwarded it.<br />In their brief arguing for prison time, prosecutors contended that Mr. Clinesmith’s behavior “struck at the very core” of the candor the FISA court “fundamentally relies on” and “allowed the FBI to conduct surveillance on a U.S. citizen based on a FISA application that the Department of Justice later acknowledged lacked probable cause.” Prison time for Mr. Clinesmith, they said, was also necessary to “deter others from committing similar crimes.”<br />Friday’s sentencing will fuel cynicism about two-tiered justice. While George Papadopoulos served time in prison for making false statements to the FBI, and a federal judge refused to drop charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn after the Justice Department said they had no basis, a top law enforcement official who abused his police powers while operating in secrecy escapes with probation.</td>

      <td>If little-informed members of the public can be egged on by social media to storm the Capitol, why can’t they be egged on to storm  GameStop  stock? They can be and were. The mistake, which will nevertheless be made, is treating an episode unique and singular in many respects as heralding a trend.<br />News is “man bites dog.” What often follows is a deluge of “analysis” about how men biting dogs is our new normal.<br />Happily, the bizarre market phenomenon that engulfed a few stocks like GameStop this week, and that resumed on Friday, is not likely to become any kind of new normal. Many episodes that command our attention tend to be self-correcting. The Capitol Hill stormers left a trail of selfies and social-media posts to help with their arrest. Though promoters of the GameStop bubble probably won’t land in jail, many are certain to end up losing their giant paper gains. Day traders might be able to drive GameStop shares temporarily from $20 to $483. They can’t make GameStop a $483 company.<br />The rebels behind this latest social-media phenomenon, unlike those who invaded Capitol Hill, seem to lack any cause at all. When asked what they are against, they’ve basically responded, “Whaddya got?” Answer: short sellers.<br />Usually seen as Wall Street’s sanitation engineers, shorts play a useful role in countering the market’s mechanical bias toward bullishness. In betting against the shares of videogame retailer GameStop and a few other troubled smallish companies, they did nothing to invite the hostility of the online hordes that decided to make their lives difficult. On the contrary, by taking their short positions, they actually gave long-term bulls a way to earn extra money by lending their own shares to assist the trades the shorts wanted to make. Many bulls likely have short positions themselves to hedge their long positions in companies like GameStop and the movie theater chain AMC.</td>

      <td>A plan to extend I-49 through a historically black neighborhood has divided Shreveport, La.</td>
      <td>Fights over whether to build freeways through city neighborhoods may seem like a thing of the past. It has been 65 years since Jane Jacobs successfully rallied opposition to Robert Moses’s plans for a highway through Manhattan’s Washington Square Park and 60 years since the Chrysler Freeway sliced through Detroit. But a version of this old fight is dividing Shreveport, La.<br />At issue is an $800 million plan to extend a 3-mile stretch of Interstate 49 through the historic African-American neighborhood of Allendale, where a few old shotgun houses, once synonymous with black poverty, still stand. The neighborhood is still poor. Fifty-four homes, some of them new, owner-occupied  structures built by a national nonprofit, and three historic black church buildings stand in the path of the proposed extension. A bipartisan coalition of local, state and federal representatives have joined forces with the Shreveport business community to target the properties for seizure via the government’s eminent-domain authority.<br />“The freeway would cause many of the newly built homes to be destroyed,” says Sharpel Welch of the nonprofit Shreveport-Bossier Community Renewal. “That’s years of revitalization down the drain.” Along with her husband, Emmitt, Ms. Welch runs a “friendship house” in Allendale, where they tutor and mentor neighborhood kids from streets where new homes sprout amid vacant lots. “It’s a David-and-Goliath situation,” she says, “but our neighbors are willing to fight.”<br />Once a regional center of the oil industry, Shreveport is the rare Sunbelt city that has been losing population—down 9% from its peak of 205,000 in 1980. Allendale is emblematic of the decline. Once a prosperous black enclave with 25,000 residents, it’s down to 6,000. “We are hemorrhaging population,” says Tim Magner of the Shreveport Chamber of Commerce. “We’re a city on the bubble, and we have to reinvent ourselves.”<br />Allendale is caught up in competing visions of how to bounce back. It’s a debate that pits a local urbanist architect allied with neighborhood families against the city’s business community. For the Chamber of Commerce and others involved in economic development, Shreveport’s best shot at revival is as a regional distribution center. I-49 stops at the north end of the city, and truck traffic must follow a slow-moving loop connector route, including local roads, to re-enter the highway south of town. Mr. Manger says the new road would link Shreveport directly to New Orleans, with its international container port, as well as to Dallas and the East Coast via I-20.</td>

      <td>French leader says West needs to act to rein in political extremism</td>
      <td>PARIS—French President Emmanuel Macron called for international regulation to curb the spread of ideological extremism in Western democracies, chiding tech companies and political correctness for allowing it to flourish.<br />Speaking to a group of reporters inside the Élysée Palace, Mr. Macron said the storming of the U.S. Capitol was a sign of the West’s failure to rein in social media platforms, allowing them to become incubators of hate, moral relativism and conspiracy theories.<br />The French leader chided tech companies—without naming them—for giving former President Donald Trump a platform to sow division for years before taking action.  Twitter Inc.  banned Mr. Trump’s personal account in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, citing the risk of further incitement of violence.  Facebook Inc.  announced a temporary suspension of Mr. Trump after the riot before extending that action indefinitely.<br />“All those who allowed President Trump to succeed waited until they were entirely sure that he had no power left to then wrap themselves in dignity and now say ‘Let’s take away his whistle,’” Mr. Macron said. “Why didn’t they shut down his accounts before all this happened?”<br />Mr. Macron said governments had delegated too much authority to tech companies by expecting them to act as stewards for Western democracy. “This is an issue for real international regulation,” Mr. Macron said.</td>

      <td>At least one of the more than 100 young women still missing after their abduction by Islamist militant group Boko Haram in the Nigerian town of Chibok almost seven years ago managed to escape her captors this week, according to family members and local officials.<br />Halima Ali Maiyanga told her family in a phone call Thursday that she was one of hundreds of captives who were able to flee amid a Nigerian military offensive against Boko Haram fighters in the Sambisa Forest in the country’s northeast.<br />The Chibok Association, formed after 276 girls were kidnapped from their high school in the town of Chibok in 2014, said several others had also won their freedom during the army’s push. More than 100 of thems were freed in 2016 and 2017 after a ransom payment and the release of some Boko Haram fighters by the government.<br />“Halima was in tears. She told us she was with the military and needed some clothes because she had nothing,” her brother Muhammad Maiyanga said. “We never thought we’d see her again.”<br />Ms. Maiyanga, now 22 years old, was 15 when she was kidnapped on the night before her year-end exams. Her older sister Maryam Ali Maiyanga managed to escape in 2017 along with an infant son born after her forced marriage to a jihadist fighter.</td>

      <td>Arnold Schoenberg’s ‘Pierrot Lunaire’ (‘Moonstruck Pierre’) so defied the melodic conventions of classical music that its premiere ended in violence.</td>
      <td><br /><br />The 1912 chamber piece “Pierrot Lunaire” (“Moonstruck Pierrot”) is a musical treasure—fascinating, enchanting in its range of instrumental colors, and deeply influential to all who came after. Yet its composer, Arnold Schoenberg (1874-1951), was for many simply the man who took a wrecking ball to centuries of musical tradition through his embrace of atonality. Much of his output engendered alarm and outright hostility. “Only a psychiatrist can help poor Schoenberg now,” wrote composer Richard Strauss to Alma Mahler in 1913. “He would do better to shovel snow instead of scribbling on music paper.”<br />Such reactions began even before the composer’s most radical departures from convention. Schoenberg’s string sextet “Transfigured Night” (1899), written when he was just 25 and now recognized as a Romantic cornerstone, was excoriated: “It sounds as if someone had smeared the score of [Wagner’s] ‘Tristan’ while it was still wet,” remarked a contemporary. A musical society in Vienna refused to allow the work to be performed because it contained one dissonant chord still unclassified at that time by any textbook (an inverted ninth, tame by today’s standards). Over the years, the complaints proliferated: At a 1913 concert conducted by Schoenberg in the Great Hall of Vienna’s Musikverein, the reaction to both the composer and his closest students, Alban Berg and Anton Webern, was even more violent than the one attending the infamous premiere of Igor Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” in Paris that same year.<br />Yet, Stravinsky, the composer most often regarded as Schoenberg’s rival for the affections of the cultivated music world, came to the late realization that Schoenberg had written “a body of works we now recognize as the epicenter of the development of our musical language.” Discussing Schoenberg’s “Pierrot Lunaire,” which had its premiere at the Berlin Choralion-Saal on Oct. 16, 1912, following 40 rehearsals, Stravinsky called it “the solar plexus as well as the mind of early 20th-century music.” The music, he admitted, 50 years after the work’s debut, initially had been “beyond me, as it was beyond all of us at that time.” At one performance “Pierrot” prompted an audience member to point at the composer and yell, “Shoot him! Shoot him!”</td>

The Supreme Court judges also overturned a third conviction, for kidnapping.<br />The court said it would explain its reasoning at a later date and ordered that he be set free from prison immediately if not wanted in any other case.<br />Washington and the Pearl family called on Pakistan to act swiftly to keep Mr. Sheikh behind bars. American officials also said Thursday that they were ready to take him to stand trial in the U.S. Mr. Sheikh, a British citizen, has been in prison since he was convicted in 2002 of kidnapping for ransom, terrorism and murder, and sentenced to death.</td>

      <td>Chevron’s careful strategy has helped it stay off radars of activist investors and regulators</td>
      <td>In a sector facing uncomfortable questions about the future, it helps to stay out of the spotlight.  Chevron  certainly managed to do that as its competitor  Exxon  Mobil faces scrutiny from activist investors and securities regulators.<br />Chevron took large write-downs earlier on in the pandemic, in line with European peers, potentially helping it stay out of asset valuation questions Exxon is facing. And while activist investors are pressuring Exxon to work on both environmental and growth sustainability, Chevron noted on Friday’s earnings call that it hasn’t faced similar pressures, noting that its investors prefer energy-transition investments that don’t erode returns.<br />Still, Chevron’s fourth-quarter results showed how far both U.S. energy giants are from recovery. For the full year, Chevron recorded a net loss of $5.5 billion, by far its worst performance in three decades and only the second time during that span that it posted an annual loss. For the quarter, the company’s revenue met Wall Street expectations, but one-off items spurred a surprise loss of $665 million.<br />There were still things to like. Chevron has been differentiating itself from Exxon through a more conservative strategy, keeping a lid on capital expenditures well before the pandemic hit. Operating cash flow, for example, was higher than analyst expectations, and its net debt ratio was 23%, even after having taken on borrowings associated with its acquisition of Noble Energy last year—well within its target range.<br />Strong fundamentals might be why Chevron has dodged the scrutiny that Exxon is facing regarding its steadily rising dividend. Both supermajors have stuck to promises to grow dividends; the difference is that Chevron can sustain it more easily. Dividends are eroding Chevron’s cash position at a much slower rate: For the full year, free cash flow minus dividends was negative $8 billion; Exxon burned through more in just the second quarter of 2020.</td>

No, not just yet, no.<br />So my cocktail needs to be an exhale of pure hell yes in the middle of it all. It’s an affirmation that punctuates the three-quarter mark in a day and carries me over the finish line. A utilitarian slug of whiskey won’t do for this moment of joy. For me, it’s a Manhattan or bust.<br />What’s so pandemic-perfect about the Manhattan is that it’s not hard to make and doesn’t require many bottles: just whiskey and sweet vermouth. My version usually starts with bourbon (though a rye-based Manhattan is also a thing of beauty) and ends with a Luxardo cherry or three. That bourbon-soaked gift at the bottom of the glass is a delicious reminder that the world hasn’t completely fallen apart, and neither have I.<br />Just the ritual of making a cocktail helps glue me back together.

      <td>WASHINGTON—A former FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to altering a document used to justify surveillance of a former adviser to Donald Trump was sentenced to 12 months of probation and 400 hours of community service on Friday.<br />In a teleconference hearing, Judge James Boasberg rebuffed requests from prosecutors to sentence former Federal Bureau of Investigation assistant general counsel Kevin Clinesmith to a prison term—finding that the media firestorm, coupled with the loss of his job and income were sufficient deterrents to similar conduct.<br />“Mr. Clinesmith has lost his job in government service—what has given his life much of its meaning,” said Judge Boasberg. “He went from being an obscure career government lawyer to standing in the eye of a media hurricane. He’s been threatened, vilified and abused on a nationwide scale,” the judge added.<br />Mr. Clinesmith addressed the court, expressing deep remorse for his actions and taking responsibility for what he described as a “critical error in judgment.” He’s the only person charged in Justice Department special counsel John Durham’s investigation into surveillance of Trump campaign associates during the 2016 election.<br />“I let the FBI, the Department of Justice, my colleagues, the public and my family down. I also let myself down. I will live with the consequences of my action as well as the deeply held feelings of regret, shame and loss caused by it for the rest of my life,” he said.</td>

      <td>Tech companies think the statute allows them to censor with impunity. The law is seldom so simple.</td>
      <td>Section numbers of federal statutes rarely stir the soul, but one of them, 230, stirs up much fear, for it has seemed to justify censorship. Relying on it, tech companies including Google and  Twitter  increasingly pull the plug on disfavored posts, websites and even people. Online moderation can be valuable, but this censorship is different. It harms Americans’ livelihoods, muzzles them in the increasingly electronic public square, distorts political and cultural conversations, influences elections, and limits our freedom to sort out the truth for ourselves.<br />But does the 1996 Communications Decency Act really justify Big Tech censorship? The key language, Section 230(c)(2), provides: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of . . . any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.” The companies take this as a license to censor with impunity.<br />That understanding is questionable. Law is rarely as clear-cut as a binary switch. To be sure, courts emphasize the breadth of Section 230’s immunity for website operators. But there is little if any federal appellate precedent upholding censorship by the big tech companies. The question therefore comes down to the statute itself. The answers should give pause to the companies and courage to those they’ve censored.<br />The fundamental problems are constitutional—the first concerning the Commerce Clause. Congress’s authority to enact Section 230 may seem indisputable because the Supreme Court has, since the New Deal, adopted an almost open-ended view of Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce. Yet congressionally emboldened censorship poses unique questions.<br />Originally, the Constitution’s broadest protection for free expression lay in Congress’s limited power. James Wilson reassured Americans in 1787—four years before the First Amendment’s ratification—that “a power similar to that which has been granted for the regulation of commerce” was not “granted to regulate literary publications,” and thus “the proposed system possesses no influence whatever upon the press.”</td>

      <td>The great black novelist wrote about whites, but white novelists of his day didn’t return the favor.</td>
      <td>I was ready to take a punch for James Baldwin. It was spring of 1992, and my one-man play about Baldwin, written at the request of the late actor Reggie Montgomery, had just been given a rehearsed reading at New York’s Lincoln Center. Most of the invited audience appeared enthusiastic, but in the foyer a naysayer approached me. Michael Thelwell, then a professor of African-American studies at Amherst College, told me many things about what he had just seen, the most polite being “Keep out.”<br />Mr. Thelwell and I had already had a discussion on the subject of a nonblack writer presuming to trespass on protected territory. The year before, when I spoke at Amherst on my biography of Baldwin, “Talking at the Gates,” Mr. Thelwell sat in the front row, harrumphing and fidgeting. In a preface to his verbal assault on me, he suggested that I, a Scotsman, would feel offended if he, a Jamaican, were to write about Celtic art and literature. He didn’t use the term “cultural appropriation” (though it was in use by that time, notably by Ralph Ellison, speaking in its favor), but that’s what was on his mind.<br />I might have felt flattered. Mr. Thelwell was among the contributors to a collection of essays published in 1968, “William Styron’s ‘Nat Turner’: Ten Black Writers Respond.” All 10 opposed Styron’s novel about a renegade slave in the state of Virginia in 1831. Mr. Thelwell’s essay is one of the most eloquent, and I had singled it out for praise in my biography.<br />Baldwin was not among the 10. His position was in direct conflict with theirs. “The Confessions of Nat Turner” is written in the first person of the black rebel leader. “He has begun the common history,” Baldwin said of Styron. “Ours.” Baldwin was not at the time in favor with the majority of black intellectuals. His homosexuality and his habit of mixing in white society were, in their eyes, marks against him.<br />Baldwin never changed his mind about what Styron had done, despite increasing disillusionment with white liberal opinion in the 1960s. Three years before his death in 1987, he said what he had been saying for years: “The conundrum of color is the inheritance of every American.” He was not talking directly about literature, but he then turned his attention to it: “The effort on the part of the Republic to avoid the presence of black people reflects itself in American literature fatally, to the detriment of that literature.” It is a less rhetorical but more subtle restatement of his support for Styron. Where were the white novelists of their generation who had chosen to follow the example of “The Confessions of Nat Turner”?</td>

      <td>The European Union’s drug regulator recommended use of a Covid-19 vaccine from  AstraZeneca  PLC, but the approval is unlikely to quell growing political furor over its effectiveness, production problems and availability.<br />Friday’s announcement from the European Medicines Agency, endorsing the vaccine’s use in people 18 and older, advances a shot that EU officials have considered critical in turning the tide of the pandemic in the region. But an EMA warning the shot hasn’t been sufficiently tested in people over 55 adds to manufacturing woes dogging the project and prompted fresh attacks.<br />Some Europeans—even high officials—have interpreted the lack of data  as meaning the vaccine isn’t effective.<br />“The real problem with AstraZeneca is that it hasn’t worked the way we expected. Because we’ve had very little information,” said French President Emmanuel Macron shortly before the EMA announcement. So far, he said, “everything seems to indicate that it’s quasi ineffective for people older than 65 years old, some say 60 years and above.”<br />Mr. Macron didn’t indicate how he drew that conclusion, and there is no publicly released data to support that.</td>

      <td>LONDON— Royal Dutch Shell  PLC’s Nigerian subsidiary has been ordered by a Dutch court to pay compensation for oil spills in two villages, a ruling that some lawyers say could encourage further cases against multinationals for pollution abroad.<br />The ruling against the energy giant is the latest step in a yearslong legal tussle over the case, which was first lodged in 2008 by four Nigerian farmers and Friends of the Earth Netherlands. They had accused  Shell  and its Nigerian subsidiary of polluting fields and fish ponds through pipe leaks in the villages of Oruma and Goi.<br />In its ruling Friday, the Court of Appeal in the Hague, where Shell has its headquarters, also ordered the company to install equipment to safeguard against future pipeline leaks. The amount of compensation payable related to the leaks, which occurred between 2004 and 2007, is yet to be determined by the court.<br />The case establishes a “duty of care for the parent company to play a role in the pollution abroad, in this case by having the duty to make sure there is a leak-detection system,” said Channa Samkalden, lawyer for the Nigerian farmers and Friends of the Earth Netherlands.<br />Shell argued that the leaks were caused by sabotage. In a statement following Friday’s ruling, the company said it was “disappointed that this court has made a different finding on the cause of these spills.” Shell didn’t say whether it would appeal against the verdict.</td>

States and local governments have been investigating opioid-industry players for several years, filing thousands of lawsuits that pushed Purdue into bankruptcy in 2019 and have resulted in multibillion-dollar settlement talks with other manufacturers and drug distributors.<br />A settlement, should one be reached, wouldn’t cover other potential legal liability, including legal claims that could be brought by Purdue or its creditors. Generally, bankrupt companies can sometimes bring legal claims against former advisers alleging advice provided resulted in management breaching duties they owe company stakeholders.</td>

      <td>People who have already had Covid-19 can be reinfected by the South African variant, a finding that could impact global fight against the pandemic</td>
      <td>JOHANNESBURG—A clinical trial of  Novavax Inc.’s  Covid-19 vaccine in South Africa produced a potentially worrying finding: Among the participants who didn’t receive the shot, an earlier Covid-19 infection didn’t appear to protect them against catching the disease again from a new strain of the coronavirus now circulating the country.<br />The trial is the first major analysis of how the South African variant functions differently in humans compared with earlier versions of the virus. Its findings are in line with earlier studies done in the laboratory that also showed that mutations in the new strain—which has been detected in 31 countries, including the U.S.—made it more resistant to antibodies triggered by a previous Covid-19 infection.<br />If confirmed by other vaccine trials currently under way in South Africa, the finding that people who have already had Covid-19 can get infected again by a new variant could have important repercussions for the world’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic. It suggests that reaching herd immunity through natural infection may be difficult if the virus mutates in ways that allow it to evade the human immune response.<br />“It has global implications,” said Shabir Madhi, the lead investigator of the South African Novavax trial and dean of the faculty of Health Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. “The immunity that was induced by the prototype virus is not protective” against the new variant.<br />But the Novavax trial, similar to some other late-stage trials of Covid-19 vaccines, also showed that the shots can produce a more powerful protection against the disease than a previous infection. Among South African participants who were HIV-negative, the Novavax vaccine was 60% effective at protecting them against symptoms of Covid-19.</td>

Today, nearly a year into the pandemic, she cares more about benefits she can use while working from her two-bedroom apartment in San Jose, Calif., such as free therapy and personalized advice on financial planning.<br />Luckily for Ms. Tracy, 31 years old, the financial-technology company where she works recently started offering both. She’s been relying on the advice of a retirement planner provided by her company for things like how much money to put in her Roth 401(k) versus a traditional one.<br />“I’ve called the financial professional at least three times,” said Ms. Tracy, a social-media and communications manager with BlueVine Inc., based in Redwood City, Calif. “It was just really helpful to talk to someone.”<br />Thanks to the intense competition for talent in Silicon Valley, the tech industry has long stood out for lavish perks that made employees feel as if they barely needed to leave the office. When the pandemic sent workers home last March, those same companies had to figure out how to keep their employees happy while they worked remotely. That brought on ukulele-building classes and virtual cocktail-making tutorials, along with a host of other, more meaningful benefits.<br />Now many companies are dusting off their return-to-office plans as the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines kindles hope for an end to the coronavirus’s persistent spread. In addition to sorting out the details of hybrid-work models, companies are figuring out which pandemic perks should eventually go away, and what needs to become permanent to keep recruiting and retaining the best talent.</td>

Some Islamic State fighters detonated explosive vests while others were shot dead, he said.<br />The operation took place less than a week after Islamic State carried out its worst attack on Iraqi civilians in years, a double suicide bombing on a busy Baghdad street that killed 32 people.<br />“Yasir’s death is another significant blow to Daesh resurgence efforts in Iraq,” said Col. Wayne Marotto, the spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, using the Arabic acronym for the group, in a tweet.</td>

      <td>Selected by the author of, most recently, ‘Britain at Bay: The Epic Story of the Second World War, 1938-1941.’</td>
      <td>By Julian Jackson (2003)<br />1. France’s surrender to the Germans on June 22, 1940, shocked the world. It had survived a more terrible ordeal from 1914 to 1918. What had gone wrong this time? The list of responsible culprits soon grew long: fascists, communists, Jews, the workers, the bourgeoisie, a sclerotic political culture, a shared spiritual malaise. Julian Jackson will have none of this. As Mr. Jackson shows in this brilliant re-examination of the Third Republic’s twilight years, France entered World War II a united, confident and powerful nation. Its cause was popular. Its army’s morale was good and much of its military equipment more modern than that of the Germans. But France fell anyway thanks to a devastating blow by a German army risking an all-or-nothing gamble. Mr. Jackson is particularly good on the quixotic atmosphere of the French headquarters in the final days. The commander-in-chief, Gen. Maurice Gamelin—brilliant and impervious to doubt—is depicted calmly eating a magnificent spun-sugar dessert at lunch while elsewhere disaster engulfs the French army.<br />By John Colville (1985)<br />2. When Winston Churchill succeeded Neville Chamberlain as Britain’s prime minister on May 10, 1940, he inherited, among other things, an assistant private secretary. Civil servant John “Jock” Colville greeted the news with dismay. It was “a serious disaster,” fellow Chamberlain loyalist R.A. Butler told Colville. “A half-breed American” had staged a coup. But Churchill’s energy and jocose enthusiasm quickly made Colville a devotee. The diary, assiduously kept, of this wry Whitehall courtier provides a fine vantage point for observing the high politics of 1940’s “finest hour.” The prime minister could be “impetuous, childish, violently offensive” when piqued, and full of bad ideas to which he stubbornly clung for far too long. Yet Colville deeply admired Churchill’s vim and vision (“he is full of fight and thrives on crisis and adversity”) and came to believe that his master, however flawed, was the indispensable man at the moment of decision.<br />By Stephen Bungay (2000)</td>

      <td>Eating high-fat, low-carbohydrate foods has helped many people battle obesity, diabetes and other health problems—even as livestock agriculture contributes significantly to greenhouse-gas emissions</td>
      <td>Choosing to avoid meat and eat a plant-based diet has never seemed so virtuous and necessary. Between the intrinsic cruelty of industrial livestock production and livestock’s climate footprint—estimated by the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization to be 14.5% of all greenhouse gases world-wide, significantly greater than that of plant agriculture—it has become increasingly difficult to defend the place of meat and animal-sourced foods in our diets. Jonathan Safran Foer, the novelist turned animal-rights activist, may have best captured this thinking in his 2019 nonfiction book, “We Are the Weather: Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast.” As he writes, “We cannot keep the kind of meals we have known and also keep the planet we have known. We must either let some eating habits go or let the planet go. It is that straightforward, that fraught.”<br />An essential part of this argument is the proposition that animal-sourced foods, and particularly red and processed meats, aren’t just bad for the planet but harmful for the people who eat them. As the journalist Michael Pollan famously urged in his 2008 bestseller “In Defense of Food,” that is why we should eat “mostly plants.” This has become the lone piece of dietary counseling on which most nutritional authorities seemingly agree. It creates a win-win proposition: By eating mostly (or even exclusively) fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes, while getting our proteins and fats from plant-based sources, we maximize our likelihood of living a long and healthy life while also doing what’s right for the planet.<br />But is it that simple? A growing body of evidence suggests it isn’t, at least not for many of us.<br />The other food movement that has won increased acceptance over the past decade is the low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet—keto, for short—which has emerged as a direct response to the explosive rise in the incidence of obesity and diabetes. More than 70% of American adults are now obese or overweight, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; nearly one in 10 is severely obese, and more than one in 10 is diabetic. An unavoidable implication of these numbers is that the conventional wisdom on weight loss—eat less, move your body more—has failed tens of millions of Americans.<br />These are the people who, sooner or later, may well experiment with alternative approaches, venturing into the realm of fad diets. They may try plant-based eating—vegetarian or even vegan—and if those don’t return them to health, try keto or one of the many variations on low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets, from the original Atkins diet to the South Beach diet to paleo to the latest trend, carnivore. If they find that an unconventional approach works for them, allowing them to achieve and maintain a relatively healthy weight without enduring hunger, that will be their motivation to sustain it. But because this way of eating is most easily accomplished with animal-sourced foods, they may come to believe that what’s good for them (and even their children) isn’t good for the planet.</td>

      <td>Movie was most-watched content on streaming platforms during Christmas week, Nielsen says, giving boost to fledging service</td>
      <td>“Wonder Woman 1984” gave the new HBO Max streaming service a much-needed boost, according to data from Nielsen.<br />The movie, which made its theatrical and streaming debut simultaneously on Christmas Day, was the most watched content on all streaming platforms for the week of December 21 through December 27, the ratings-measurement firm said.<br />According to Nielsen data, “Wonder Woman 1984” had nearly 2.3 billion minutes viewed in its first three days on WarnerMedia’s HBO Max. That topped second-place “Soul,” the new Pixar movie on  Walt Disney Co.  ’s Disney+, which had 1.7 billion minutes viewed. While minutes viewed for “Wonder Woman 1984” was 35% higher, its run time is 155 minutes and “Soul,” has a run time of only 107 minutes.<br />This is the second time Nielsen issued streaming ratings for the week of Christmas. Last week, Nielsen had reported that “Soul” was the most-watched content. HBO Max then gave Nielsen permission to share its data for the first time since the service was launched in May, leading Nielsen to reissue the numbers with “Wonder Woman 1984” on top.<br />While WarnerMedia hasn’t released any data on how “Wonder Woman 1984” has performed, HBO Max did add nearly five million activations of the service in December to bring its total to 17 million.</td>

      <td>Like its peers, the oil giant endured a tough 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic crushed demand for fossil fuels</td>
      <td>Chevron Corp.  posted its third consecutive quarterly loss Friday to close its worst year since 2016, as the global pandemic continues to weigh on the oil-and-gas industry and cloud hopes for renewed economic growth in 2021.<br />Chevron is looking to turn the corner on one of the most painful years in modern history for oil-and-gas companies. For the fourth quarter, Chevron posted a loss of $665 million. For all of 2020, the loss totaled $5.5 billion as the coronavirus sapped global demand for fossil fuels. Chevron reported nearly $3 billion in profit for 2019.<br />“We’ve demonstrated that we can survive a year unlike any other and come through it even stronger,” Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview. “Now we’ve got to come through this pandemic and see what the real state of the global economy is, and I think it’s going to be uneven.”<br />Chevron’s oil-and-gas-production unit posted $501 million in profit for the fourth quarter, but the results were weighed down by the refining and chemical businesses, as well as higher pension expenses and costs related to the $5 billion acquisition of Noble Energy last year.<br />Chevron’s share price has fallen about 20% over the past year, a steep decline but better than many of its peers. Investors have expressed more faith in Chevron than rival Exxon Mobil Corp. because it entered the downturn with a stronger balance sheet. Exxon had about $69 billion in debt as of September, while Chevron had around $35 billion, according to S&P Capital IQ.</td>
