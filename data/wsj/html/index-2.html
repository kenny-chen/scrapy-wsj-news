      <td>S&P 500 appears poised to climb to a new all-time high, building on its over 15% advance so far this year</td>
      <td>U.S. stock futures ticked up Tuesday, suggesting that the major benchmarks may extend their rally a day after closing at records.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced about 0.4%. Both indexes closed at all-time highs on Monday. Contracts on the Nasdaq-100 index climbed 0.4%, signaling that technology stocks will also gain.<br />Stocks are powering higher in the final days of the year, driven in part by the cheap money unleashed by central banks and governments to shield the global economy from the coronavirus pandemic. The S&P 500 index has climbed over 15% this year, building on its 29% surge in 2019, while the Nasdaq Composite Index has gained over 43% in 2020 alone.<br />“Some people are getting carried away by the race for records. The market momentum is pushing and exceeding these record highs,” said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro research at  ING Groep .  “They are fictive thresholds, but benchmarks can live their own lives and this is happening now.”<br />Trading volumes are also typically thinner in the final days of the year with many people on vacation, which can potentially amplify market moves.</td>

      <td>The use of Snapchat, Instagram or TikTok can fray or strengthen ties, depending on whether pals communicate the same way</td>
      <td>For many teenagers, the past year has been a blur of online classes, remote extracurriculars and virtual holiday celebrations. The shift to small-screen living might not seem like a major adjustment for teens already glued to their devices, but it has reshaped what is most critical to them: their friendships.<br />I interviewed five teenagers across the country to learn what nearly a year of living virtually has been like for them. A common theme is that their tech choices—or those of their parents and even their friends’ parents—dictate with whom they have stayed in touch. That was the case, to some extent, before the Covid-19 pandemic, but it has become starker in the months since many in-person interactions came to an abrupt end in March.<br />Nearly half of the 849 teens surveyed by Common Sense Media late last spring reported feeling less connected than usual with their friends after schools closed. Students who had once talked to certain friends every day in the school cafeteria or in the hallway suddenly lost touch with all but their closest pals once schools shut down, unless they happened to be connected on the same social-media apps. Some even lost touch with their best friends because of the technology they do or don’t use.<br />Here is how these teenagers say technology has dictated their friendships in the months since the pandemic altered their social interactions.<br />Ian Pase, a 16-year-old from Anaheim Hills, Calif., who has attended his public school remotely since the spring, prefers Snapchat to keep in touch with friends. “There are a lot of people who I’m not superclose friends with who I liked talking to in class but we don’t have each other’s social media so we can’t really communicate anymore,” he said. “I also have friends who don’t have Snapchat because their parents don’t allow them to have it. They use Instagram to text each other so there’s kind of a disconnect.”</td>

Investors include Tokyo-based trading company  Mitsubishi Corp.<br />The government-owned Japan Bank for International Cooperation said Tuesday it would lend slightly more than a third of the total $1.767 billion in financing for the project. It said the project would “contribute to economic development in Vietnam through the stable supply of electricity.” Japanese commercial banks and the Export-Import Bank of Korea are also providing financing.<br />The project has become a flashpoint in the debate over whether rich nations should continue supporting coal-fired power in developing nations with growing electricity demand.<br />Critics of the project include a group of international investors and Japan’s own environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, who is considered a potential future prime minister. In January, Mr. Koizumi said the project couldn’t gain the understanding of the international community.</td>

The fund managed by Blumberg’s American Ventures division will be the company’s fifth distressed fund since 1992 but the first one it has raised in the past decade, according to Philip Blumberg, founder and chief executive.<br />“In this market we expect discounts of up to 35%,” Mr. Blumberg predicted. “It will be the best buying opportunity since 2010.”<br />Numerous other investment companies also think that historic opportunities await because of the havoc wrought to the commercial property market by the pandemic. Their thinking is that prices will plummet because fear of contagion has kept people away from malls, airports and office buildings.<br />Other companies that have raised or are raising distressed funds include  KKR & Co. ,  Kayne Anderson Real Estate and Terra Capital Partners. Heavyweights like  Brookfield Asset Management  and Starwood Capital Group are sitting on billions of dollars in cash and capital commitments that could be used for that purpose.</td>

      <td>U.S. doesn’t need to reach full herd immunity before public spaces can begin phased reopenings</td>
      <td>As 2021 arrives, there is one question that matters most: How soon can we escape the Covid-19 pandemic?<br />The answer is as elusive as it is pressing. It is unknown what level of natural infection and immunization is needed to reach herd immunity in the population. It is also unknown how many people in the U.S. have already contracted the coronavirus. Whatever the answer to the question, trillions of dollars in economic activity are at stake, as are millions of livelihoods.<br />By some metrics, things have never been worse: U.S. hospitalizations are at a record high, and public-health experts continue to warn that things will get worse before they get better. With more than 19 million confirmed cases in the U.S., achieving herd immunity is a ways off. After all, that figure accounts for just 6% of the U.S. population. And with daily new cases still reaching well into the hundreds of thousands, it seems unrealistic to hope for Covid-19 to vanish in the new year. Worse, public polling has suggested that some adults won’t take a vaccine if offered.<br />However, the outlook for the year ahead is much brighter than those grim figures would suggest. Eradicating Covid-19 shouldn’t be necessary to begin a gradual return to schools, restaurants, concert halls and arenas.<br />While the challenge of vaccinating a large portion of the country is significant, it might not be as daunting as it first seems. There are roughly 333 million people in the U.S., but not everyone will need a vaccine right away. For starters, about 19 million people have a confirmed case. The true number of cases is likely much higher: Many patients with confirmed cases do not show symptoms, and some people who experience symptoms consistent with Covid-19 choose not to seek medical attention. Children make up a large share of the U.S. population, and there is little evidence that schools are hot spots for spreading the virus. That suggests vaccinating children shouldn’t be a prerequisite for returning to normal. So far, the shots available in the U.S. are only authorized for patients 16 and older.</td>

      <td>Competing bids to Salesforce’s offer didn’t emerge, even after news of firms’ merger talks surfaced</td>
      <td>One of the largest tech deals this year also shows why there might be a lot fewer of them in the future.<br />Salesforce.com ’s  $27.7 billion acquisition of  Slack Technologies ,  announced this month, was the largest to date for the hyperacquisitive cloud-software provider, as well as the second-largest deal so far in the software space—behind IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat in 2018, according to Dealogic. The high price Salesforce paid—representing 26 times Slack’s projected revenue for the next 12 months—led many to speculate that the company faced competition on the deal.<br />But that wasn’t the case. According to a regulatory filing last week detailing the background of the merger, Slack Chief Executive Stewart Butterfield said he received “informal messages” from representatives of two large, publicly traded U.S. technology companies on Nov. 25—the day The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks between the two companies. But those reps only “expressed a desire to discuss the market rumors,” according to Mr. Butterfield. No actual competing bids emerged.<br />That isn’t a surprise. Besides the rather generous valuation Salesforce was already offering, the most likely competition would have come from tech giants that are already under intense government scrutiny.  Amazon.com  and Alphabet’s Google in particular operate large cloud businesses that could have benefited from the addition of Slack’s popular messaging platform. But Google is now the subject of several antitrust lawsuits from the federal government and most states, while Amazon is dealing with its own government probes into how it competes in the retail and cloud-services sectors.<br />Microsoft ,  while not under the same level of scrutiny, was also an unlikely bidder. The software giant has become Slack’s primary competitor with the popularity of its Teams platform, which has been reporting superior growth numbers to Slack of late. Having its own history with government crackdowns would also likely make Microsoft think twice before spending top dollar to take out a competitor. Other tech giants will be making similar calculations for the foreseeable future.</td>

      <td>As the rollout of wind and solar picks up speed, solutions to bridge their intermittency are likely to take off too</td>
      <td><br />The rapid growth of wind and solar power comes with a well-known problem: They don’t work all the time. Energy storage is a solution investors should watch in 2021, even if it doesn’t yet lend itself to stock picking.<br />Governments around the world greatly raised their decarbonization ambitions this year. There is great uncertainty about how their promises will be delivered, but almost all scenarios involve massive building of solar and wind farms. As their share of power production grows, it will become crucial to bridge the times when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine.<br />Building wind and solar together can reduce the gaps, while gas-fueled power plants can provide a nonrenewable backup. Also helpful are demand-side response agreements—when big power consumers promise to cut their usage during pinch points in exchange for lower prices.<br />Even with all these methods, though, it will be necessary to store excess electricity for use in lean times.</td>

      <td>A handful of startups and larger firms are experimenting with nationally competitive, nonlocalized pay. Is the extra cost worth the added employee goodwill?</td>
      <td>Tech workers and employers alike are beginning to question location-focused pay scales. A handful of companies are moving to abandon them altogether.<br />In setting pay without regard for location, tech companies including Reddit Inc. and  Zillow Group Inc.  are making a potentially expensive gamble to retain talent and gain a hiring edge. The move can entail maintaining relatively high salaries of employees who are relocating, and adopting a revised scale for new hires. Though it is early, the move challenges a long-held, but not universal, notion that where people live should determine what they make.<br />Some big tech firms including  Facebook Inc.  were clear early on in the pandemic that people moving away from the Bay Area to less expensive cities would see a pay cut. Payment platform Stripe Inc. offered one-time bonuses for workers who moved out of San Francisco, Seattle or New York—and agreed to a pay cut of up to 10%.<br />But a pay cut for any reason can be bad for worker morale, said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis who researches pay determination. “Employers really have to do a bit of a dance to justify it to workers,” he said.<br />Workers considering more flexible work scenarios are themselves divided. A November survey of 600 tech workers by the job-search platform Indeed found that 60% of respondents would be willing to take a pay cut to work remotely permanently while 40% said they wouldn’t.</td>

      <td>Office-building landlords are hoping that the massive Covid-19 vaccination campaign launched in the U.S. this month will lead to millions of people returning to workplaces in 2021 after spending most of the pandemic working from home.<br />But it isn’t going to be soon. Rather, a widespread return probably won’t take place until the late spring or early summer of 2021 when enough people have been vaccinated in the U.S. for the population to come close to achieving “herd immunity,” according to public-health professionals and executives in the real-estate industry.<br />Moreover, the office world that will be reinhabited next year will look a lot different from the one that was hurriedly vacated in mid-March when the fear of Covid-19 sent much of the U.S. labor force into lockdown. During an initial transition period, office density likely will be low, workers will wear masks and a range of other safety precautions will be followed.<br />Long-term changes in the workplace will continue for years. Working from home and other remote locations, which became a necessity during the pandemic, will likely remain a major part of the workplace, employers and real-estate executives say.<br />Businesses that are highly competitive for top talent will likely begin opening small satellite offices in metropolitan areas and offering employees the option of working there, at home or in centralized headquarters—or a combination of the three. Design firm Gensler already is working with a half dozen Fortune 100 companies on such “hub-and-spoke” strategies, as they are becoming known in the office industry, said Joseph Brancato, co-chairman of the firm.</td>

Professional investors such as Stanley Druckenmiller and companies like Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. began investing this year. Companies like Robinhood Markets Inc. and  PayPal Holdings Inc.  allowed their customers to buy and sell bitcoin.<br />Despite those inroads, industry watchers say bitcoin must gain traction as a form of payment to become more ubiquitous. Spending it isn’t easy. Few merchants accept it, and many people are still unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency. Its use is generally limited to high-end purchases, like those at Mr. Dossa’s dealership.<br />Bitcoin, introduced in 2008, was designed to operate as a form of electronic cash, allowing users to exchange value as quickly and cheaply as sending an email. In practice, its adoption was hampered by several factors. In early years, it was difficult for average users to operate the digital wallets that stored their holdings. Many of the companies that tried accepting bitcoin in 2014 and 2015, including  Expedia Group Inc.  and Dell Inc., later quietly dropped it.</td>

It took them almost eight years to achieve the same growth following the seizure of global financial markets in September 2008.<br />That burst of bond-buying has revived a debate about quantitative easing, and how it might impose a fiscal cost on the countries pursuing it. But the circumstances in which to worry look fairly limited.<br />The logic goes like this: When the central bank buys bonds from commercial banks, the proceeds are credited to those banks in the form of additional reserves parked at the monetary authority. The central bank then pays interest on those reserves. In periods like the past decade when the market value of bond portfolios has swelled, that has been profitable for central banks.<br />But if interest rates were to rise, all that might reverse: The central bank would be paying higher interest on its reserves—very short-term liabilities—and the value of its long-maturity bondholdings would decline. That might leave the central bank requiring assistance from the fiscal authority to be recapitalized, or at the very least cut short the profit central banks return to their finance ministries.<br />The important factor is the circumstances in which major developed economies might face an unexpected rise in inflation. There is a great deal we still don’t really know about inflationary pressure. But if it came from an economy genuinely running hot, it is very likely that tax revenues would be rising anyway, more than offsetting any expense rising from central bank losses.</td>

      <td>U.S. regulators established industrywide requirements for remote identification of drones, along with new safeguards for flights over populated areas and at night, in a long-awaited effort to expand commercial use of the craft.<br />The pair of final rules issued Monday is intended to promote eventual widespread home delivery of small packages and a multitude of other applications for pilotless vehicles that are currently sharply restricted. But with a single announcement, the Federal Aviation Administration is formally pivoting from approving case-by-case exemptions to setting broad safety standards the industry has long sought.<br />The new approach, replacing stringent protections that currently bar practically all home-delivery options, go into effect in two months, but some requirements are likely to take years to implement.<br />The detailed regulations, which total more than 700 pages and parts of which had been in the works since the Obama administration, also aim to address concerns related to law enforcement, national security and privacy protection.<br />“They get us closer to the day when we will more routinely see drone operations such as the delivery of packages,” FAA chief Steve Dickson said in a written statement accompanying the rules. Mr. Dickson has told colleagues he intends to stay on under the Biden administration, according to people involved in the conversations, to fill out the remainder of his five-year term ending in 2024. The rules are unlikely to be affected by other personnel changes.</td>

Pricing can change based on investor feedback until the day before a company’s stock starts trading.<br />SAP CEO Christian Klein in July said the company would take Qualtrics public while remaining the majority shareholder.

      <td>Maybe the GOP will stand up on trade once Joe Biden is picking winners.</td>
      <td>President Trump will soon leave town, but his tariffs may be staying. Joe Biden hasn’t been exactly clear about his trade policy, so perhaps it’s time to point out one unsightly effect of the Trump tariffs: expanding the D.C. swamp.<br />Republicans who cheered when the Trump Administration picked winners and losers might soon find out what it’s like when the Biden Administration does it. Take Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who lobbied last year for a company in his state, SM Products, to get tariff exclusions on imported Chinese-manufactured saw blades.<br />In a Sept. 19, 2019, letter to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), four members of Missouri’s congressional delegation, including Mr. Hawley, argued that “it would not be beneficial to impair a small American company that does not have the financial resources or alternative supply chain options.” Since SM’s costs and prices are “locked in many months before delivery,” the legislators wrote, the Missouri company “must absorb the entire cost of the tariffs,” likely precluding profitability.<br />Join the club. Countless American businesses were in a similar situation. Most weren’t lucky enough—or connected enough—to have a U.S. Senator pleading their case. Yet you might be surprised. As Mr. Trump’s tariffs began to bite, Congress sent hundreds of letters to the USTR, supporting specific tariff exclusions. The examples here are taken from about 100 pages of correspondence from 2019, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request.<br />Mark Meadows, now the White House chief of staff, urged tariff exclusions in a Nov. 22, 2019, letter, aiming to prevent “severe economic harm to an important business in my district.” He said the USTR had “my wholehearted support in your work to combat Chinese intellectual property theft and industrial espionage.” But given how fast Mr. Trump’s tariffs were kicking in, “it was not possible for Fairfield Chair to develop a new relationship with a new supplier of similar quality.” Please, please don’t tax these beech wood components from China.</td>

      <td>President Trump finally signed the Covid-19 relief bill and 2021 budget on Sunday night, but not before giving a big assist to Democratic hopes of gaining control of the Senate in the two runoff elections on Jan. 5. Current GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is left this week trying to undo the significant political damage.<br />Mr. Trump had been insisting that Congress write checks of $2,000 each to most Americans, rather than the $600 in the bill. His own Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, negotiated the $600 figure. But after the bill passed, Mr. Trump decided that wasn’t enough.<br />Never mind that the $2,000 would go to tens of millions of Americans who have kept their jobs and maintained their incomes during the pandemic. It would also add some $350 billion or more to a federal deficit that is already into the trillions of dollars. The economy won’t benefit since the recipients aren’t going to change their behavior knowing it’s merely a one-time check.<br />Senate Republicans oppose the $2,000 for these sound reasons, but Mr. Trump has put them in a political spot. Democrats immediately joined Mr. Trump’s call for the $2,000, and on Monday House Democrats were expected to vote to approve the extra cash.<br />That leaves Mr. McConnell with a tough call of barring a vote as Democrats bang away in TV ads in Georgia against GOP incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Or he can hold a vote, which would split the GOP caucus and upset fiscally conservative voters. Either way it amounts to a Donald Trump in-kind contribution to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden.</td>

Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said Monday he would sign the bill, a move cheered by tenant advocates who said the state would be enacting one of the strictest eviction moratoriums in the country. Opponents said the legislation didn’t do enough to protect landlords and could prevent struggling building owners from paying their taxes.<br />The bill effectively bans all evictions statewide for 60 days, including those already in motion. After that, tenants who are unable to pay their rent because of the coronavirus pandemic can file paperwork to prevent or suspend eviction proceedings until May 1. Households where a member is at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 are also protected under the bill.<br />“You do not solve a public health crisis, you do not solve an economic crisis, by kicking people out on the street,” said state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, a Democrat from Brooklyn. “You solve it by keeping people in their homes.”<br />The state Senate voted Monday afternoon to approve the legislation, and the Assembly continued its debate into the evening.</td>

      <td>From Tokyo, a pointed Taiwan question for the President-elect.</td>
      <td>In a 2020 campaign with little foreign policy substance, the idea Joe Biden mentioned most was restoring alliances. Which alliances? With Mr. Biden’s inauguration less than four weeks away, some allies in the Asia-Pacific are apprehensive.<br />Last week Japan’s number-two civilian defense official told Reuters: “We are concerned China will expand its aggressive stance into areas other than Hong Kong. I think one of the next targets, or what everyone is worried about, is Taiwan.”<br />Yasuhide Nakayama added: “So far, I haven’t yet seen a clear policy or an announcement on Taiwan from Joe Biden. I would like to hear it quickly, then we can also prepare our response on Taiwan in accordance.” He also asked, according to Reuters, “How will Joe Biden in the White House react in any case if China crosses this red line?”<br />Hardliners in Beijing see democratic Taiwan as a separatist province and are determined to bring it under their control. They also want Taiwan’s advanced microchip technology. Meanwhile, opinion in Taiwan has moved against unification, especially as China reneges on its treaty obligations by arresting democracy supporters in Hong Kong. A Chinese military operation across the 110-mile Taiwan Strait during Mr. Biden’s term can’t be ruled out.<br />The loss of democratic Taiwan’s independence against its will would be a geopolitical earthquake. The Pacific balance of power would shift decisively in China’s favor. Asian countries would need to recalibrate their relationship with the U.S., with dramatic implications for global security and trade.</td>

      <td>President Trump signed into law another round of direct payments to households as part of a coronavirus aid package</td>
      <td>President Trump on Dec. 27 signed into law a roughly $900 billion coronavirus aid package that will provide a second round of stimulus payments to households. Here is what we know about who will receive the checks and how they will receive the money.<br />Households will get $600 per adult and $600 a child, down from $1,200 and $500 in the first round delivered earlier in the pandemic. That means a single parent with two children will get $1,800 now after receiving $2,200 in the spring.<br />In all, the government will spend $164 billion on the second round.<br />The payments start phasing out when individual adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000, when head-of-household income exceeds $112,500, and when income for married couples filing jointly exceeds $150,000. For individuals without children, the payments go to zero when income reaches $87,000; that is $174,000 for married couples. The numbers are generally based on 2019 income.<br />Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week, when Congress was finishing work on the package, that the first batch of payments could go out at the beginning of the Dec. 28 week. But Mr. Trump didn’t sign the package until Sunday night—six days after final congressional approval. A senior Treasury official on Monday said the department anticipates being able to make the $600 stimulus payments “on the same timeline as previously discussed.”</td>

      <td>Paternalism is the wrong approach. Patients need full information about the risks and benefits.</td>
      <td>Now that two Covid-19 vaccines have received emergency-use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, the conversation has turned to the crucial goal of persuading as many people as possible to get vaccinated. We worry that public-health authorities may follow strategies that do more harm than good.<br />The current communication strategy—built on listening to advice from trusted leaders—is paternalistic and outdated. Public-health authorities, politicians, sports heroes and celebrities are taking to the airwaves to tout the vaccines. Protecting people from doubt is central to the strategy. That entails suppressing questions rather than answering them. Any hint about vaccine imperfections could make people apprehensive and must be avoided. Anyone who rejects the vaccine is stigmatized as foolish and irresponsible.<br />A better approach to persuasion is to assume you’re speaking to mature, self-interested decision makers, offer transparent and comprehensive information about the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and engage patients in the decision-making process. Many medical treatments require consideration of the balance between harms and benefits. Over the past 40 years the practice of medicine has evolved to embrace a process known as shared medical decision-making, in which physicians provide patients with the best scientific information about benefits and risks, and patients make decisions in collaboration with their doctors, which balance their personal preferences with imperfect science and uncertain risks. The same decision isn’t right for everyone.<br />Applying shared decision-making to the coronavirus vaccine requires authorities to change their mind-set. Instead of pressuring patients to “do the right thing,” the emphasis would be on honest disclosure about what to expect. In recent FDA hearings for the  Pfizer  and the Moderna vaccines, multiple witnesses pointed to higher-than-expected side-effect rates. For both vaccines, these rates appear to be higher than those for other commonly used inoculations, such Pneumovax 23 and Shingrix, for which patients frequently report side effects.<br />In both Covid-19 trials, substantial majorities of participants in the vaccine group had local reactions at the injection site. More than half of participants experienced a systemic side effect like fatigue, headache or fever. In both studies there were a few cases of Bell’s palsy, a temporary or lasting partial paralysis of the face. These were attributed to chance because they were rare, but seven of the eight total cases in the two studies were among those who received the vaccine rather than a placebo.</td>

Trust me, today’s America is nothing like it was then. And even under segregation, the marginalization was not total. My father was a plumber, my mother a school librarian. We were treated kindly. The local shopkeepers wanted our business, but they also wanted to avoid trouble from the few who believed wholeheartedly in racial segregation.<br />The segregation wasn’t uniform. One doctor had a separate waiting room; the other didn’t. Ditto for the town’s two dentists. Once the 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawed separate facilities, things opened up very quickly.<br />Many of the authors, commentators and journalists who spend all their energy thinking and talking about race today fail to acknowledge how much has improved with regard to race in this country. There are countless successful black Americans today—doctors and lawyers, entrepreneurs and academics, journalists and artists, compassionate politicians and famous Hollywood actors. Their numbers will keep growing as long as we remember six things:<br />First, every life matters. Mine is not one cell more or less valuable than anyone else’s.

Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said that providers that ignore   this will face fines of up to $1 million and a revocation of all state licenses.<br />In addition, Mr. Cuomo said that the state attorney general’s office would now be handling a case involving ParCare Community Health Network, a health-care provider with offices in New York City and Orange County. State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said over the weekend that ParCare was being investigated by the state police for possibly obtaining the vaccine fraudulently and then transferring it to other parts of the state and administering it to the public without paying heed to the prioritization rules.<br />Ultimately, Mr. Cuomo said he wants “to send a clear signal” that the state won’t tolerate attempts to subvert the process it has put in place for vaccine distribution and administration.<br />“If you violate the law on these vaccinations, we will find out and you will be prosecuted,” he said.</td>

As for Mr. Swalwell’s China connection, the  New York Times  still refuses even to mention it.<br />But it isn’t just the Biden and Swalwell stories the press is missing.

The organization hopefully assumes some economic benefits from the legislation for an optimistic but still staggering net cost of $3.5 trillion over five years.<br />And for some reason, even though vaccines are being distributed, the  economy is growing and employment has increased for seven straight months—for a total of 12 million jobs added since the spring shutdowns—President-elect Joe Biden is still suggesting that much more massive government intervention is required.<br />In October CRFB estimated the Biden agenda would add more than $10 trillion in new spending over a decade (not even counting new Covid spending), partially funded by more than $4 trillion in new taxes. To make it happen Mr. Biden has introduced an economic team of activists largely unblemished by market experience.<br />The Biden program is bound to discourage entrepreneurial creativity. Yet nothing can seem to turn the Sanders frown upside down.</td>

      <td>The alt rock of an earlier decade is influencing artists like Post Malone, Phoebe Bridgers, Taylor Swift and more—many of whom were too young to experience bands like Nirvana and the Goo Goo Dolls firsthand.</td>
      <td><br /><br />On April 24, rapper and singer Post Malone, born Austin Post, strapped on a guitar and stood in front of a camera to perform Nirvana covers for more than an hour. The live-streamed event raised money for Covid relief and was one of the more successful early experiments in providing a concert experience during the lockdown, raising more than $500,000 with 200,000 people watching at one point.<br />Mr. Post’s own music—a spare and low-key hybrid of rap and pop—sounds nothing like Nirvana, but his rendering of the Seattle grunge band’s catalog led to hosannas from former Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, along with Kurt Cobain’s widow, Hole frontwoman Courtney Love. And this was even more notable since Mr. Post, age 25, was born in 1995, the year after Mr. Cobain died by suicide. The live-stream was one highly visible moment among many in 2020 that confirmed how thoroughly ’90s alternative rock—both the heavier and folkier varieties—has now become part of the musical conversation for those who were too young to experience it firsthand.<br />Among the most highly anticipated debut albums of 2020 was “Fake It Flowers” from 20-year-old Filipino-British singer-songwriter Beatrice Laus, who performs as Beabadoobee. In 2019, Ms. Laus released a single called “I Wish I Was Stephen Malkmus,” the frontman of the quintessential ’90s indie rock band Pavement. Her LP transports the thick guitar sound of that decade and its quiet-versus-loud choruses into the present moment. While plenty of indie rock bands have touched on grunge over the years, her record channeled the more accessible end of the genre and imparted a veneer of slickness. “Fake It Flowers” made some year-end lists, was a modest success on its own terms, and offers a glimpse at how the sound of ’90s rock might be integrated into the pop of the future.</td>

In signing the bill, the president called on Congress to increase the size of direct payments to Americans and said he wanted an investigation into alleged voter fraud and the repeal of a law concerning social-media companies.<br />Mr. Trump’s decision to sign the aid bill came after extensive lobbying from Republican lawmakers and advisers, said people familiar with the conversations.<br />Mr. Trump made the final decision Sunday during a phone call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), said a person with knowledge of the talks. But it came after days of consultation with aides and allies, among them former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.<br />Allies argued that blocking the bill could hurt the chances of Republicans running in a Georgia special election on Jan. 5 that will determine control of the Senate. They also urged Mr. Trump to consider his political legacy and encouraged him to sign the bill while still pressing Congress to do more.</td>

She was charged with aiding an enemy country and destabilizing the Saudi regime, as well as speaking with foreign journalists and diplomats, contacting Saudi dissidents living abroad and applying for a job at the United Nations.<br />The Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh, a tribunal set up in 2008 to try al Qaeda suspects, sentenced her Monday to five years and eight months in jail, starting from the date of her arrest, according to her family and people familiar with the case. A reduction for time served means she will likely be released in March on three years’ probation, with a five-year travel ban.<br />Ms. Hathloul, who has been kept largely in solitary confinement and held a two-week hunger strike in November to protest her prison conditions, has appeared physically weak in court, her body shaking and voice faint.

One tip in particular, he said, gave investigators a name and led them to places to search for forensic evidence to match to tissue found at the site of the bombing.

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday it has set its first-ever climate standards for commercial airliners and large business jets, aligning U.S. rules with global standards and giving jet makers eight years to comply.<br />The move follows years of momentum internationally to address the airline industry’s contribution to climate change. The sector accounts for about 2% of the global carbon emissions that are warming the planet, according to U.S. data and environmental groups. The EPA first proposed the rule in July while under legal pressure from environmental groups and amid concern from U.S. jet-makers about international sales.<br />The new rules create efficiency standards to limit carbon-dioxide and nitrous-oxide emissions from commercial airliners and large business jets in the U.S. starting in 2028. Aircraft companies have to apply the limits to any new designs starting this year.<br />The core of these regulations adopt metrics established by the International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations’ commercial-aviation regulator. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in July that the U.S. aviation industry had made it clear the agency should be adopting those standards to ensure consistency globally.<br />The EPA’s action helps prevent U.S. jets from getting shut out of the international market. U.S. manufacturers export three of every four aircraft they make, the EPA has said, and U.S. companies face the potential of losing those sales if their planes don’t meet international standards.</td>

      <td>PARIS—Three French soldiers were killed in Mali on Monday when their vehicle hit a bomb during operations under France’s counterterrorism mission in the West African nation, the French government said.<br />France has more than 5,000 soldiers deployed in an area spanning thousands of miles from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to Chad in the east. Over the past seven years, the forces have fought branches of Islamic State, al Qaeda and other militant groups, which roam the region’s isolated villages and threaten government forces in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and elsewhere.<br />The soldiers killed Monday were conducting operations around Hombori, a small town in Mali’s central Mopti province, as part of the French military’s Operation Barkhane campaign against Islamist militants across the Sahel region of Africa, authorities said. They identified the soldiers as Tanerii Mauri, Dorian Issakhanian and Quentin Pauchet. The three soldiers were from a military regiment based in the town of Thierville-sur-Meuse in the east of France, they said.<br />Their deaths bring French fatalities to at least 47 soldiers during the current operation and the short operation before it, which began in 2013. That includes an accident in November 2019, when two French helicopters collided during a mission in northern Mali, killing 13 soldiers.<br />The U.S. military has provided key support to the French operation, including drone surveillance and other intelligence-gathering activities. In 2017, Islamist militants killed four U.S. soldiers based in Niger.</td>

      <td>Short pieces from 20 Irish composers, a serial space opera and a trio of works inspired by famous diaries.</td>
      <td><br />With opera gone digital due to the Covid-19 pandemic, fans can experience voices, composers and opera companies they might never otherwise have heard. The Irish National Opera commissioned short (five- to eight-minute) pieces from 20 Irish composers. Recorded in Dublin’s Gaiety Theatre with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra and filmed in a lively variety of styles, the resulting “20 Shots of Opera”, available free, is an exhilarating jaunt through up-to-the-minute lyric creativity. Unlike the experience of losing yourself in the lengthy grandeur of more traditional operas, you absorb these intimate quick takes like jolts of recognition.<br />In the opening comedy, “Mrs. Streicher” by Gerald Barry, the best-known of the composers, a tenor sits at a table ranting furiously about servants and laundry, with interjections from a tuba. The text is from Beethoven’s letters. Several pieces explore separation: In Éna Brennan’s “Rupture,” a soprano duels with her inner, critical voice; in Hannah Peel’s “Close,” two women have an awkward first in-person, socially distanced date. One powerful group of works looks at death: In Alex Dowling’s “Her Name,” a sweet-voiced choirboy mourns his mother; Michael Gallen’s “At a Loss” is a large-scale diva turn, as the soprano awaits news of her mother’s death; Andrew Hamilton’s “Erth Upon Erth” is a wordless howl, starting with a woman’s mouth in close-up and ending with her zipped into a body bag on a gurney.<br />Operas made just for film can inspire highly creative visuals. “Verballing” by David Coonan employs black-and-white animation. A female police officer, getting schooled in how to question a murder suspect, sings just one word—“Yeah,” repeated higher and higher. The instructions appear only in type, and as the tension mounts, the background dissolves so that her white face floats in a sea of darkness. In the hilarious “A Message for Marty (or `The Ring’)” by Conor Mitchell, two sisters call out an ex (who dumped one of them by text); the jittery cellphone picture, the tacky costumes, and the escalating fury, plus a snippet of Wagner, is opera extremism in modern dress.<br />Most of the pieces are for women’s voices, exploring different timbres and expressivity. I was struck by the fierce intensity of mezzo Naomi Louisa O’Connell in Emma O’Halloran’s “The Wait,” and the simple, folk-like cadences of Benedict Schlepper-Connolly’s “Dust,” a lament for the natural world, poignantly sung by Michelle O’Rourke. And the insidiously floating and twisting soprano line of “Libris Solar,” sung by Claudia Boyle, made me want to hear something longer from composer Jennifer Walshe.</td>

      <td>Voters who chose him still have faith in public institutions. His goal should be to reassure the rest.</td>
      <td>Many Americans were taken aback when 126 members of Congress joined a specious lawsuit to overturn last month’s presidential election. It appeared to be the latest, most glaring evidence that the country’s commitment to its constitutional system is in decline. But there’s reason for hope. Hyperbolic calls to abandon the core institutions of American life—demands to forsake capitalism from the left, and vicious, norm-busting partisanship from Donald Trump’s Republicans—were defeated handily this year. The result of the presidential election showed that beyond repudiating President Trump, Americans are seeking renewal and revitalization.<br />To be sure, polarization is a real and serious problem. But this election was less about whether the U.S. would tack left or right, and more about whether the country would embrace compassion. Americans rejected the radical vituperation proselytized on the fringes and chose the optimistic tradition of social justice associated with Pope John XXIII. (I know that may sound strange coming from a practicing Jew, but here we are.) The man who decisively defeated Mr. Trump reflects the “silent majority” of Americans, who believe in renewing rather than revolutionizing our political and economic systems. Rooted in faith, Joe Biden’s promise to “save the soul of the nation” reflected his determination to address the political, economic and cultural alienation that fuels fervor on the far right and left alike.<br />Those who feel vindicated by Mr. Biden’s victory shouldn’t lose sight of how we got here—or how we got President Trump four years ago. A significant minority of the country is angry, and their anger is, at root, entirely legitimate. Trump supporters and the far left both sense that in today’s America the powerful few get ahead and don’t see, hear or value everyday people. I realize that people on either edge of the political spectrum naturally take offense at being lumped in with the other lot. But everyone who still champions democratic capitalism—and that’s most of us—needs to realize that the calls for revolution from right and left have a common foundation in grievance and estrangement.<br />Their uproar was a long time coming. Many of today’s radicalized voters come from families who sacrificed when the country went to war over phantom weapons of mass destruction and watched the responsible policy makers get off scot-free. Their communities were decimated by the financial crisis, and banks got bailouts while victims were left holding the bag. Today they struggle to afford college even as celebrities lie and cheat to get their children into elite schools. Over the years they’ve grown to believe that there are two sets of rules in the U.S.—one for the rich and powerful, and one for everyone else. They’re not entirely wrong.<br />But the solution isn’t to blow up the system, ignoring the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box. Nor is it right for proponents of America’s institutions to castigate, shun, cancel or demonize those who have lost faith. Both camps have become ideologically tribal, and Mr. Trump was particularly adept at exploiting the desire to find fellowship in grievance. But the first step in reconciliation or bridging a political divide is to control any impulse to dismiss the other side, and instead reach for mutual understanding. That’s why Americans should adopt Mr. Biden’s belief that everyone counts, that everyone’s voice matters, and that our collective responsibility is to ensure that the country can “grow together.”</td>

      <td>I was sworn in as U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey on Jan. 17, 2002. Six days later, Daniel Pearl, South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was kidnapped in Karachi, Pakistan. Pearl was investigating a story about the shoe bomber, Richard Reid, and had been promised by his kidnappers that they would take him to meet Sheikh Mubarak Ali Gilani. Pearl believed Sheikh Mubarak had information regarding Mr. Reid, the British terrorist who attempted to detonate an explosive device in his shoe aboard a Paris-to-Miami flight in December 2001. Pearl never met Sheikh Mubarak—the meeting was a setup—and he was never seen again. The killers released a videotape of Pearl’s murder.<br />The Pearl investigation was my baptism into the world of terrorism. We were all still reeling from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The FBI had set up a command center at the South Brunswick, N.J., headquarters of Dow Jones, the Journal’s publisher. Through the combined efforts of the Justice Department and Pakistani authorities, three men were identified as having taken part in the abduction. Their organization, the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty, had been sending ransom demands to the Dow Jones computer servers in New Jersey. Through great computer forensics, the task force of combined American and Pakistani authorities was able to identify and arrest three people, including the mastermind of the abduction, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh.<br />Mr. Sheikh already had a record of terrorism. In 1994, then a member of Harkat ul-Ansar, an Islamic militant organization, he was convicted of kidnapping four people, including an American in India. He was jailed in India but after his terrorist friends hijacked an Indian Airlines flight, Mr. Sheikh was freed in exchange for the passengers. With assistance from the Taliban, he made his way to Afghanistan.<br />Mr. Sheikh was indicted in March 2002 by a New Jersey grand jury for the kidnapping of Pearl resulting in his murder. The indictment is still viable and it is a case for which the U.S. can seek the death penalty. In announcing the indictment, Attorney General John Ashcroft also announced the unsealing of an indictment charging Mr. Sheikh with the kidnapping of the American tourist in India.<br />Mr. Sheikh and his co-conspirators were also charged in Pakistan. They were tried in 2002 and convicted. While his accomplices were given life sentences, Mr. Sheikh was sentenced to death. His appeal languished until April, when a Pakistani court ordered the release of all the defendants on the grounds that there was conflicting testimony at the original trial and insufficient evidence to support the murder charge. The Pakistani authorities have been fighting the release and have kept Mr. Sheikh jailed. But on Thursday the court again ordered his release.</td>

Public-health officials say that despite the introduction of the first two Covid-19 vaccines in the U.S., additional vaccines will be needed to meet demand and control the pandemic.<br />“We’ve come this far, this fast, but we need to get to the finish line,” said Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, which is helping to fund the Novavax study. “That will require multiple vaccines using different approaches to ensure everyone is protected safely and effectively from this deadly disease.”<br />The company didn’t say when it expects to generate results from the new study, but it will likely be spring at the earliest. Studies of the first two vaccines from  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna Inc.  took nearly four months for results to become available.<br />U.S. regulators authorized emergency use of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines this month. Large U.S. studies of two more vaccines, from  Johnson & Johnson  and from  AstraZeneca  PLC and Oxford University, could yield results and potential authorizations by February, federal officials said recently.</td>

      <td>Kelley Cutler was deeply skeptical when she took part in a monthlong pilot test of Reveri Health, a new digital hypnosis program, at Stanford University last year. The San Francisco social worker needed help quitting smoking, and only joined the program at her doctor’s urging.<br />“I was thinking it was nonsense and was never going to work,” says Ms. Cutler, 44, who had smoked for 25 years. Her first hypnosis session, which took place in person with a clinician, was so anxiety-producing that she had to have a cigarette afterward.<br />Reveri Health, one of a new generation of hypnosis programs and apps that make the practice easily accessible at home, then required her to take part in interactive, self-hypnosis sessions at home for a month. After two of the digital sessions, she was shocked to discover that she no longer felt like smoking. “The craving was really gone,” she says. “I can’t explain it. It doesn’t make sense.”<br />She hasn’t had a cigarette since. “This hypnosis is some crazy-ass voodoo,” she says. “And I mean that in a good way.”<br />Hypnosis is no longer considered crazy in the medical field, doctors say, but many patients, like Ms. Cutler, are leery. The practice has increasingly gained acceptance in the medical community, and in the last two years, the research into how and why it works has accelerated, with new studies on the use of hypnosis to alleviate anxiety; ward off pain; and successfully inhibit the fear circuitry structures in the brain.</td>

In both Europe and Asia, the idea of a border wall was turned on its head. No longer were walls built to keep invaders out but to keep people in. I have seen governments so loathed that minefields, guard towers and canine patrols were required to keep inmates, euphemistically called citizens, from escaping their borders. At its most benign, socialism requires compulsion and control of state media. A fair telling of this ill-conceived experiment might disabuse our young of its allure.<br />Conan M. Ward<br />Princeton, N.J.<br /><br />A warning against groupthink is useful. But a warning like Mr. Satter’s, solely against groupthink on the left, is only a warning against the left styled as a defense of liberal norms. Today’s right doesn’t like dissent, either. For many Republican politicians, accepting the election result would have “ended any hope of a career,” to use Mr. Satter’s words. Talk about an “attempt to impose a deluded version of reality.” The right’s leader cultivates a personality cult and campaigns against “enemies of the people.” These are core Soviet practices.</td>

Getting tougher economically will be, well, tough.<br />Despite four years of pressure from the Trump administration, China’s economy actually is stronger in some ways at the moment than is the economy of the West. Though China has plenty of its own problems, international capital is flowing in, not out. Within Asia, China actually has improved its trade position.<br />“China is in a strong negotiating situation,” says Josh Lipsky, director of programs and policy at the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center. He adds: “The centrifugal forces coming out of China are stronger than they were in 2017.”<br />Indeed, the International Monetary Fund projects that China’s economy will expand by 1.9% in 2020, which means it is likely to be the only major world economy to grow in this year of the coronavirus pandemic.

And guess what happens with credits and certificates if your new trip is more expensive than the original: United charges you the difference.<br />Confused?

      <td>A new book debunks popular myths, including ‘that your inner primal macho ripped hunter-gatherer ancestor is who you were meant to be.’</td>
      <td>One of the biggest myths about exercise is that it’s natural. If anything, human instincts lean more toward taking a nap. Want to feel bad about skipping a workout? Blame evolution.<br />Daniel E. Lieberman argues this theory in his new book “Exercised: Why Something We Never Evolved to Do Is Healthy and Rewarding,” which tips some of the fitness world’s most sacred cows. Everyone knows exercise is good for them, yet studies show most people don’t get enough of it. Mr. Lieberman set out to find out why, and the answers, he hopes, will help remove some of the shame people feel about their own inactivity that makes it even harder to get moving.<br />Mr. Lieberman criticizes people he calls “exercists” who brag about how much they work out and pass judgment on the less fit as unnaturally lazy. Those who take the escalator instead of the stairs are not guilty of the sin of sloth, he writes, but doing what they were evolved to do—saving energy only for what is necessary or recreational.<br />Other highlights from the book out Jan. 5: People who believe brutal cross-training workouts bring them closer to the brawny body that belonged to their ancient forebears probably are not familiar with research that shows Neanderthals were only slightly more muscular than today’s regular humans. Fitness buffs who think civilization’s pampering has muted our natural strength might not realize that a profoundly inactive couch potato moves more than a typical chimpanzee in a day. As for our natural talents, it bears noting that the average person runs as fast as a hippo.<br />Mr. Lieberman, 56, a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University, helped popularize barefoot running in the U.S. after publishing a paper in Nature on how and why people ran barefoot before the invention of shoes. In this book, the biological anthropologist hails the benefits of fitness and recommends beating the anti-exercise instinct by working out with friends and making commitments like registering for a race. His philosophy: Any movement is an improvement on none, more is usually better, and it is never too late to start.</td>

      <td>Treasury yields might finally have seen their historic low. The question is how long the Fed will slow their ascent.</td>
      <td>Long-term Treasury yields seem poised to move up in the first half of 2021, but the Federal Reserve may set a limit on how high they can go.<br />At 0.95%, the yield on the 10-year Treasury is up from the levels it plumbed earlier this year but is near a historic low. That reflects bond-market investors’ continued uncertainty about how strong the economy will be on the other side of the pandemic and whether higher inflation will take hold. It also reflects a promise from the Fed that it will keep its target range on overnight rates near zero until it sees evidence of a tight labor market and inflation has obviously cleared its 2% target rate, and that it will keep buying $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage bonds each month until jobs and inflation have made “substantial further progress.”<br />Investors’ hesitancy on the economy and inflation should ease as spring approaches, however. As more of the population gets vaccinated and warm weather returns, spending on services in particular will likely rebound. Inflation should pick up as well, in part because, starting in March, the year-ago inflation comparison will be with when the pandemic first hit, but also because rebounding demand will at least temporarily boost prices. As that occurs, belief in the Fed’s low-rate promise could start to wear thin. It is, after all, one thing for the central bank to say it will keep rates low when the country is still in the grips of a crisis and another when the crisis is receding.<br />But Fed officials also might try to limit how much Treasury yields rise. Memories of the 2013 “taper tantrum,” when expectations the Fed was about to reduce its bond purchases pushed yields higher, stifling the recovery, are still fresh. Moreover, after a yearlong policy review, the Fed this summer concluded that it should allow for catch-up periods after inflation has been below its target—effectively saying that it should keep rates lower than it has in the past. Next year could see the Fed taking pains to remind investors of that change in stance.<br />Still, the 10-year yield might need to be closer to 2% than 1% before the Fed starts complaining. The lowest long-term rates that investors will ever see might already have come and gone.</td>

But many employers still use minimum wages to set pay rates.

      <td>LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault faces the challenge of reviving Tiffany during a difficult time for the luxury industry</td>
      <td>Tiffany  & Co. shareholders are expected this week to approve a merger with  LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE  that would give the French luxury giant a big cut of the high-end jewelry market and close months of drama that nearly killed the $15.8 billion agreement.<br />Wednesday’s vote is also expected to cap a deal in which LVMH’s controlling shareholder, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, didn’t get his way.<br />Mr. Arnault fought for months to renegotiate the merger after the Covid-19 pandemic threw the luxury industry into turmoil. He asked the French government for help getting out of it and later enlisted a  Rothschild  & Co. banker to conduct back-channel talks with Tiffany, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Arnault, upset over Tiffany’s insistence on paying full shareholder dividends before the deal closed, demanded the jeweler lower the deal price by 11%, the people said.<br />Tiffany declined and pressed ahead with a lawsuit, filed in a Delaware court, to enforce the initial merger agreement.<br />In the end, LVMH agreed to buy Tiffany at a 2.6% discount from the original deal price. Tiffany made a $70 million dividend payment last week.</td>

      <td>The Chinese housing market has boomed, outstripping the rampant growth of the economy itself. This is how the nexus of households, local governments, banks and developers functions.</td>
      <td>A Chinese asset market that barely existed three decades ago is now one of the world’s largest and most important centres of leverage and economic activity.<br />The country’s property sector has developed at a breakneck pace, construction and asset prices have surged, and the country’s top real-estate developers have become some of the largest firms in the world.<br />Real-estate investment has outstripped GDP growth for the most of the last two decades, excluding brief periods of financial stress in 2008-09, 2015-16 and the first quarter of 2020, figures from China’s National Bureau of Statistics show. With negligible foreign investment, that means debt has mounted both at developers and the families buying the properties.<br />As recently as 1978, virtually no housing was privately owned in China. Creeping experimental reforms led to the beginning of wholesale privatization of the public housing stock in 1988. In the early and mid-1990s, the real-estate giants of today—and their future billionaire owners—were just coming into existence.<br />In December 1987, Shenzhen held its first auction of land use rights, a practice mimicking the sales conducted a few miles south in Hong Kong, still under British control at the time. The model would eventually be adopted by municipalities across the country and become a major source of funding for cash-strapped local governments.</td>

      <td>Company’s Hong Kong-listed shares slumped 8% Monday, extending a Christmas Eve selloff as investors reassess regulatory risks</td>
      <td>No longer China’s most valuable company,  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  has erased almost all its stock-market gains this year, just days after Chinese regulators signaled a major change in their posture toward the e-commerce behemoth and its finance affiliate, Ant Group Co.<br />Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed shares tumbled a further 8% on Monday, after China’s central bank released a harshly worded statement Sunday criticizing Ant’s business practices and instructing the financial-technology giant to shift its focus back to its mainstay—and less lucrative—digital-payments business.<br />The declines extended a stock selloff on Christmas Eve, taking Alibaba’s market capitalization down to $586 billion. Just two months earlier, it had hit a record of nearly $859 billion on expectations that Alibaba would profit handsomely from Ant’s public listing.<br />Alibaba’s swift comedown has led investors to reassess the regulatory risks faced by Chinese internet companies. Last Thursday, the country’s top commerce regulator said it is investigating whether Alibaba abused its dominant market position in online retailing through activities such as making merchants sell products exclusively on its platforms.<br />The hard part is figuring out “how much of the recent regulatory moves against Ant and Alibaba is politically based, how far it will go, and when it will be over,” said Alex Au, managing director at Alphalex Capital Management, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund. He said he is considering buying Alibaba shares if they fall further.</td>

      <td>For some traders, U.S. crude futures prices plunging below zero in April highlighted their flaws as a global benchmark</td>
      <td>A tumultuous year in oil markets left the energy industry reeling and gave fresh impetus to a perennial debate: What is the best gauge of crude prices?<br />The Covid-19 pandemic confined billions of people to their homes and shut or slowed portions of the global economy in 2020, crimping demand for oil. Depots, pipelines and vessels were flooded with crude, threatening to overwhelm the world’s ability to store it.<br />The crisis reached its crescendo in April, when the price of light, sweet U.S. crude futures dived below $0 a barrel for the first time. Some traders were paying others to take oil off their hands.<br />“What we saw was the single largest demand event in history,” said Peter Keavey, managing director for energy products at  CME  Group, owner of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where U.S. crude futures trade.<br />Prices have since somewhat recovered. But those jarring moves of the spring added urgency to arguments about whether benchmarks used since the 1980s adequately reflect the modern oil market. Newer gauges, including Shanghai-traded futures and a contract for Abu Dhabi’s Murban crude that will make its debut in March, are expected to grow in popularity.</td>

      <td>The SolarWinds hack has boosted shares of the former cybersecurity star, but the benefits aren’t so clear-cut</td>
      <td>Going from predator to prey back to predator again has been a profitable ride for  FireEye  investors. How it works out for the company itself remains to be seen.<br />High-profile network breaches have often been a boon for cybersecurity stocks, and the massive  SolarWinds  hack has been no exception. The NYSE FactSet Global Cyber Security Index has jumped 13% since the attack was reported on Dec. 13. The 12 largest pure-play vendors on that index are now up an average 20% in that time.<br />The attack used a flaw in the network-management software sold by SolarWinds, a Texas-based IT company that counts many federal agencies as customers. But ironically, it was brought to light by FireEye, which specializes in hack investigations and was itself a victim of the attack.<br />It has been a wild ride. FireEye’s shares sank 13% after it reported the breach of its own system on Dec. 8. That seemed like very bad news for a company that is often the first call for other companies who suffer an attack. Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard warned at the time that FireEye faced a clear risk of “reputational damage,” even as the company described the attack as the work of “a highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.”<br />But since more news has dribbled out about the scale of the attack and SolarWinds’ centrality to it, sentiment shifted hard. FireEye’s shares have soared 66% from their initial selloff and are now up 49% this month—beating out even other red-hot cybersecurity names such as  CrowdStrike  and  Zscaler  that analysts believe will be the primary beneficiaries of increased corporate IT security spending. Those two are up 44% and 32% for the month, respectively, and more than 300% for the year. SolarWinds, by contrast, has lost one-third of its market value since the attack became public.</td>

      <td>Grocery-delivery service Instacart Inc. once seemed like the perfect partner for supermarkets looking to break into e-commerce. After several years together, though, some grocers are starting to question the relationship.<br />Instacart’s technology provided a ready-made solution for grocery chains that hadn’t yet created options for customers to shop online. And it became even more attractive when delivery demand ballooned with the pandemic, providing armies of on-demand shoppers to fulfill orders in-store and deliver groceries to people’s homes.<br />But many supermarkets say they aren’t making money through Instacart, largely because the delivery company typically charges them a commission of more than 10% of each order. Some of Instacart’s retailer partners say the service holds too much control over customer interactions and expect it to take an increasing share of money that food makers spend on marketing. All that has put grocers in a bind, as delivery continues to boom and becomes a necessity.<br />“We don’t think we make money from an Instacart order,” said Mark Skogen, CEO of Skogen’s Foodliner Inc., which operates more than 30 stores under its Festival Foods brand and began offering Instacart about a year ago.<br />Delivery remains costly because his company pays Instacart a percentage of its online sales, Mr. Skogen said. The grocer still works with Instacart because it allows for higher revenue even if there is no profit.</td>

      <td>U.K. prime minister’s policies so far don’t suggest he wants to embark on a Margaret Thatcher-style economic revolution</td>
      <td>LONDON—British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ended a rocky year on a high note, with a free-trade agreement with the European Union under his belt and mass vaccination against Covid-19 under way.<br />Now that the country is unconstrained by most EU rules, he has a once-in-a-generation political opportunity to reshape the U.K. and define its post-EU direction. The big unknown is what he will do with that opportunity.<br />Brexit was billed by some of its longtime advocates as a way of unleashing a new dynamism in Britain by ditching Brussels’ red tape to create a low-tax, freewheeling “Singapore-on-Thames”—a phrase coined by a previous British Treasury chief, Philip Hammond—selling its goods and services across the world.<br />But Mr. Johnson isn’t a free-market Conservative in the mold of Margaret Thatcher. He has so far promised Britons more regulation, not less, with ambitious plans to raise the minimum wage and curb greenhouse-gas emissions. He has promised more state spending, not less, in order to “level up” an economy he says is too dependent on London and southern England.<br />Such policies enabled him to win big in last year’s election in districts traditionally hostile to the ruling Conservatives, while his dogged pursuit of Brexit alienated many of his party’s traditional allies in corporate boardrooms. All these tensions present a puzzle: If Mr. Johnson doesn’t want another Thatcher-style economic revolution, what does he want to do with Britain’s freedom from Brussels?</td>

      <td>Ant’s troubles may be particularly severe, but others should be watching their backs</td>
      <td>China’s latest salvo against one of its most well-known technology giants could portend a more perilous regulatory regime for others in the industry as well.<br />China’s central bank Sunday publicly criticized Ant Group, which owns one of the country’s two dominant digital-payment systems, for multiple regulatory failings and urged the company to rectify problems in some of its fastest-growing areas such as online lending. Ant was accused of engaging in regulatory arbitrage, showing contempt for regulatory compliance, and damaging consumers’ rights. On Thursday, China’s market regulator said it had launched an antitrust probe into Alibaba, which owns a third of Ant.<br />The writing has been on the wall for Ant ever since regulators forced the company to put a last-minute stop to its combined $34 billion of initial public offerings in Hong Kong and Shanghai last month. Ant will likely have to scale back some of its higher-margin, faster-growing businesses, such as online lending. The company has previously acted as an online platform for these loans without taking on much of the risk—an asset-light model that made investors give it a valuation above $300 billion before its IPOs ran aground, but was also likely a factor irking regulators. Ant may now have to put up more of its own capital and be regulated more like a bank.<br />Beijing’s one-two punch against the business empire of Jack Ma, the billionaire co-founder of Alibaba, clearly reflects his dwindling political fortunes, but it may also point to a shift in the regulatory environment for other technology companies. Many of the problems highlighted by regulators were well-known. Alibaba’s rivals, for example, have long complained about the company’s practice of forcing merchants to sell exclusively on its platforms, though Beijing hasn’t taken much concrete action to tackle this until now. The government last month issued draft rules against monopolistic practices on digital platforms.<br />Chinese technology giants have become so big partly because the government has imposed relatively few constraints on their growth. Tighter regulations could be good news if Beijing is going to lay out clear boundaries and rules, helping create a level playing field. But if it means more arbitrary regulatory actions related to political, rather than market missteps, that could be a nightmare for Chinese technology giants—and their investors.</td>

Fortunately, I learned that as a minority member of the house, and it’s probably a worthwhile experience for anybody who’s a Democrat today.”<br />Mr. Schimminger was first elected in 1976 in a district that includes north Buffalo.

      <td>Ordained in Rangoon, he urged his Buddhist co-religionists to despise British colonialism. His Dublin origins may have added to the fervor.</td>
      <td>The endearingly earnest authors of “The Irish Buddhist” describe their book as “a detective story across two centuries.” Although their sleuthing is mostly archival, the tale they assemble is captivating—a jigsaw-biography that pieces together the life of Dhammaloka, a “forgotten monk” who, we’re told, “faced down the British Empire.”<br />This last assertion may seem overstated—the British Empire was, after all, a vast and impregnable place in the first decade of the 20th century, when Dhammaloka was at his militant peak. Yet the monk, born in the Dublin area in the 1850s, did succeed in making an almighty nuisance of himself in Burma, a Buddhist colonial backwater that was then a province of British India. So much so that he was charged with sedition, the cardinal colonial sin.<br />Dhammaloka arrived in Burma as William Colvin—almost certainly not his real name—sometime before 1900, traveling from Australia (it is thought) via Ceylon and India. Already steeped in Buddhist learning, he was ordained as a monk in Rangoon in July of that year. The event was “no simple and quiet affair,” the book tells us, but a lavish ceremony funded by a local merchant. Gathered to see the “auspicious ordination of a European into the Buddhist order” were more than 100 monks and 200 laypersons. The officiant was a “particularly prominent” Burmese monk and scholar.<br />It’s likely that Dhammaloka regarded this treatment as entirely befitting. As the book’s authors—Alicia Turner, Laurence Cox and Brian Bocking, all professors of religious studies—write, the Irish Buddhist cut a “bombastic” public figure. The monastic name he chose for himself can mean both“realm of the law” and “light of the law” in Pali, the sacred language of the Theravada Buddhism practiced in Burma.<br />Once ordained, Dhammaloka embarked on a 10-year spree of deliberate confrontation with the British colonial authorities, mainly in Burma but also in Ceylon, Malaya, Hong Kong and Singapore. The authors tell us that the stock-in-trade of this “disruptive, border-hopping monk” was the “Buddhist revivalist” sermon, by which he addressed crowds of Burmese natives on the evils of Christianity. A stern advocate of temperance, he inveighed against alcohol; he also spoke out against the British military presence in Burma and elsewhere. His “three-part critique” of colonialism, the authors observe, centered on “the Bible, the bottle, and the Gatling gun.”</td>

      <td>Cleveland was missing four wide receivers in a 23-16 defeat against New York that could cost the team a playoff spot</td>
      <td>Early Sunday morning, the Cleveland Browns found themselves conducting a makeshift practice in a parking garage. They went over plays, assessed their roster and figured out how to play an NFL game just hours later without almost all of their top receivers had been sidelined by contact tracing.<br />Spending their morning in a frigid New Jersey garage was slightly less grim than how they spent their afternoon. They lost to the New York Jets.<br />The 23-16 loss could cost the Browns a spot in the playoffs, and it was the latest demonstration of how the virus that has upended a country and its most popular sport isn’t stopping as the season hits the home stretch.<br />The Browns were in this predicament after a player received a positive Covid-19 test result Saturday. Their facility was closed, their flight from Cleveland later in the day was delayed and a host of players were forced into league-mandated isolation as close contacts. Those players happened to include their most productive wide receivers, so they held the quick walk-through at the garage next to their hotel Sunday to come up with a game plan when they were missing the likes of Jarvis Landry.<br />It was clear throughout the game that Cleveland quarterback Baker Mayfield missed his usual weapons. He completed just 28 of 53 passes and lost two fumbles, including one late in the fourth quarter that ended the game. It was a crushing outcome for a franchise that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2002 and appeared on a path to break that drought. Then they lost to one of the NFL’s worst teams—the Jets hadn’t won a single game until last week after losing their first 13 games.</td>

One of the stars is former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm to lead the Department of Energy, and the choice suggests a return to climate corporate subsidies.<br />DOE’s main duties are to oversee nuclear sites, set efficiency standards and dole out government largesse. But her credential for Mr. Biden may be that, during her governorship from 2003 to 2011, Ms. Granholm handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to politically favored startups to create “green jobs.” Many of her bets failed.<br />Take fledgling electric-car battery manufacturer A123 Systems, which was awarded a $249 million DOE grant plus $125 million in state tax credits. Plagued by manufacturing problems, A123 went bankrupt in 2012. China’s Wanxiang Group bought most of its assets.<br />A123’s customer, Fisker Automotive, also went bust in 2013 after receiving a $192 million DOE loan with the goal of manufacturing a hybrid at a plant located in Mr. Biden’s senatorial backyard. Fisker was backed by prominent liberal investors including Al Gore. “Lobbying by all local politicians is said to have won the day for the Wilmington plant,” the Washington Post reported in 2013.<br />Ms. Granholm also offered battery manufacturer  LG Chem  $125 million on top of the $150 million in federal stimulus dollars it received. While LG Chem is still in business, its employees at the time were caught watching movies and playing games on the clock because they ostensibly had little productive to do.</td>

      <td>The FDA also eases its vigilance over cherry pie standards.</td>
      <td>Unknown to most Americans, the Food and Drug Administration has for decades regulated the ingredients, composition, flavor and appearance of many foods. In a small victory for consumer choice and food innovation, the FDA this month proposed liberating French dressing and frozen cherry pie.<br />The 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorizes the FDA to regulate the “standards of identity” of hundreds of food products to ensure uniform labelling. Ever wonder why some foods taste and look the same regardless of the brand? Credit the FDA.<br />The FDA requires ketchup to have a pH of 4.2±0.2 and lemon juice “may be used in quantities no greater than necessary to adjust the pH.” The consistency must also be such “that its flow is not more than 14 centimeters in 30 seconds at 20 °C.” Manufacturers have more leeway with hummus, aioli and pickle relish.<br />The FDA standards of identity have grown to occupy thousands of pages in the Federal Register and now serve mainly to fatten trial lawyers who can sue manufacturers if their labels don’t conform to government specifications. This is why some low-fat ice creams are labeled frozen dairy desserts.<br />Since 1950 the FDA has required that French salad dressing be made of oil, “acidifying ingredients” such as vinegar or lemon juice with vegetable oil constituting 35% by weight, though it need not include tomato paste. The FDA is especially vigilant on the threat from frozen cherry pie.</td>

      <td>Donald Trump ran for President on wiping out the Islamic State and stopping China’s economic predations. Edward Snowden’s illegal disclosures weakened America’s defenses against foreign terrorists and boosted Beijing’s cyber-espionage against the U.S.<br />So why are there murmurs that the President is considering a pardon for the unrepentant former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, who stole over a million American national-security documents and absconded to Hong Kong and then Moscow?<br />In office Mr. Trump was stung repeatedly by grandiose government leakers who thought they stood above the democratic process. That description also fits Mr. Snowden, who never formally registered complaints about U.S. intelligence policies while contracting for the government, but has since made himself a celebrity with claims of moral righteousness.<br />But Mr. Trump seems to be in a mood to break things as his term comes to a close, and Mr. Snowden’s defenders have sought to appeal to the President’s suspicion of the U.S. intelligence agencies to entice him toward a midnight pardon. The likes of Roger Stone and Senator Rand Paul suggest that Mr. Snowden is a useful figure in Mr. Trump’s campaign against the intelligence establishment.<br />It would be a travesty if the President fell for this. The victims of Snowden-style treachery are ordinary Americans, not Mr. Trump’s “deep state” foes. A pardon for Mr. Snowden’s behavior would invite more of it.</td>

      <td>The president-elect longs for ‘normal,’ but inherits an EU courting China and pushing out the U.S.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration is committed to restoring normal service in U.S. relations with Europe, but the truth is there is no “normal” left. The European Commission talks of a “new trans-Atlantic agenda for global change,” but the European Union is also rushing to complete a trade deal with China. The incoming administration finds itself at odds with the EU over trade and investment. The Biden crowd should ponder one of President Obama’s favorite lines, “The world is what it is,” and respond with as much realism and as little idealism as possible.<br />Trans-Atlantic relations may improve in tone, but their content has changed and was changing long before Donald Trump entered the White House. The Cold War ended three decades ago. The fruits of that American-led victory include a liberal, democratic and peaceful Europe. The worm in the apple is that the Europeans can act independently, whether as individual nations or in concert through the EU. The more independent they are, the less they want advice from Americans.<br />The post-Cold War divergence of American and European interests is usually attributed to the George W. Bush administration’s response to 9/11: the bungled interventions that set off a human wave of migrants and terrorism in Europe; the hostile behavior of the Department of Homeland Security, which remains a powerful disincentive to visiting the U.S. All true, but deeper processes were already at work.<br />The full quotation, from V.S. Naipaul, is: “The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it.” In 1945, most of Europe was nothing but rubble. By 1990 Western Europe had remade itself under American supervision and protection. The EU has since expanded to 27 states and sought to secure a place as an independent node in a multipolar world.<br />Strategic competition with the U.S. is a natural part of that effort. As Sweden’s then-Prime Minister Goran Persson said in June 2001, the EU is “one of the few institutions we can develop as a balance to U.S. world domination.”</td>

      <td>January will be tough but with sensible precautions the virus can be a manageable risk by spring.</td>
      <td>The novel coronavirus is about to make its last major stand, so prepare for the most difficult six weeks yet. But things will look up as spring approaches. Stay safe and try to avoid being the last person to get sick from Covid-19.<br />Next year will still require caution, but fear of Covid won’t dominate life after the winter recedes. Prevalence will decline sharply in the spring and summer. The virus may re-emerge in the fall, but it can be a manageable threat with the right precautions.<br />That said, relegating the pandemic to 2020 will require some changes. The virus is likely to become endemic, meaning it will continue to circulate but at a much lower level than the epidemic. If we are prudent, next fall could look like an especially virulent flu season in which the vaccines are a poor match. Most of the activities Americans enjoy will resume, though some of them will require precautions.<br />That starts with changes in the way people go to work. It should be frowned upon to come to work sick and try to “brave out” a cold. Testing for flu and Covid will be widespread with home tests. Many people may still prefer to wear masks in public venues, but they won’t be required. We will be more mindful of ventilation indoors and crowds in confined spaces.<br />These steps will have benefits that go beyond Covid. They’ll also slow the spread of other respiratory infections—including influenza, which exacts a huge toll each year. The flu caused more than 40 million symptomatic illnesses and 650,000 hospitalizations in the 2018-19 season, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A 2018 study in the journal Vaccine estimates the economic damage, including reduced productivity, at $11.2 billion a year. That figure may be conservative; some models say the burden is up to $87 billion annually.</td>

      <td>The federal government sues the chain for filling valid prescriptions in compliance with state law.</td>
      <td>Alcohol sales to adults are legal in all 50 states, and some substantial percentage of legally purchased alcohol is consumed by alcoholics, to their and society’s detriment. Imagine a federal lawsuit against a grocery chain for selling beer to adults without protecting alcoholics from buying it. Such a case would be groundless: No federal law limits beer sales to adults in this way.<br />The Justice Department last week announced a similarly groundless civil suit against  Walmart .  The complaint alleges that the chain’s 5,000-plus pharmacies fueled the opioid crisis by “unlawfully” filling prescriptions.<br />Like the hypothetical beer case, this case against Walmart mocks the rule of law. State laws require pharmacists to fill prescriptions that have been validly written by qualified medical practitioners. Pharmacists lack the expertise to second-guess doctors’ judgments about the appropriate necessity of a medication and the proper dosing for a particular patient. To write a prescription for a controlled substance—which includes all opioids—a physician must be qualified by the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Walmart complies with that federal rule.<br />When Walmart pharmacists have hesitated to fill legally written opioid prescriptions, they have often been subjected to state sanctions. The president of the Texas Medical Board threatened to issue “cease and desist orders” against pharmacists who “change amounts of opioids prescribed” or “override” a physician’s judgment, on grounds that doing so constitutes practicing medicine without a license. Wisconsin’s Board of Pharmacy threatened disciplinary action against a Walmart pharmacy because it “informed a local clinic that the Pharmacy would no longer fill controlled substance prescriptions from that clinic due to concerns of overprescribing.” Complaints against Walmart and its pharmacists for refusing to fill opioid prescriptions have been filed with or pursued by pharmacy boards in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia.<br />Under the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, when there’s a contradiction between valid federal and state law, the former prevails. But there’s no federal law requiring that Walmart pharmacists refuse to fill prescriptions that state law requires them to fill. The Controlled Substances Act creates only two circumstances in which pharmacists commit a federal crime by filling facially valid prescriptions for controlled substances.</td>

Follow me on a magical musical tour down one last rabbit hole before the lockdown looney tunes end. Music will set you free.<br />You’ve probably seen zillions of concert movies, from “Woodstock” and “The Song Remains the Same” to “American Utopia.” But I think a choice list of movies can lead us all the way to the essence of the 1960s-to-’80s music scene. Forget reading a book; that’s like swimming a marathon—we’ve got to see and hear the story.<br />Maybe we warm up with the daddy-issues biopics “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Rocketman.” Or the raunchy “The Dirt” about Mötley Crüe, who just have issues period. Or “Sid and Nancy.” But forget fiction. Let’s hear from real musicians. Don’t stop me now.<br />We’re ready for “Echo in the Canyon” about the music scene in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles—lots on Roger McGuinn and David Crosby of the Byrds (the Beatles’ favorite American band, it turns out). Their unique sound came from Rickenbacker guitars made in nearby Santa Ana. John Lennon played a Rickenbacker, and when someone from the company invited the band to a New York hotel to see the second-ever-made electric 12-string guitar, George Harrison grabbed it and changed pop music forever. Americans supplied the weapons Eric Clapton and other Brits used in the Invasion. We’ll learn the beginnings of the Beach Boys, mixing in The Mamas and The Papas, plus Stephen Stills and Neil Young of Buffalo Springfield. Is this that essence we’re searching for? Maybe, but it certainly reveals the origin of decades of American music.<br />The narrator of “Echo” is Jakob Dylan, Bob’s son. So next watch Martin Scorsese’s “Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story.” It’s about the 1975-76 ragtag bus tour of Dylan and a collection of musicians—there’s Joni Mitchell, and hangers-on like Allen Ginsberg. Be warned, there are a lot of fake Easter eggs in the documentary, including actress Sharon Stone in a Kiss T-shirt joining the tour.</td>

      <td>The five U.S. citizens and one permanent resident are pawns in a power struggle.</td>
      <td>Six Venezuelan-born Citgo executives were living and working in the U.S. in mid-November 2017 when they were summoned by Citgo parent PdVSA—the Venezuelan state-owned oil monopoly—to Caracas for a meeting.<br />The five naturalized U.S. citizens and one U.S. permanent resident were in good standing with the Houston-based firm. As they boarded the corporate jet, they couldn’t have known that they were headed for prison.<br />As the team convened in a PdVSA boardroom on Nov. 21, 2017, Venezuelan military intelligence swooped in to arrest them. They were charged with embezzlement, though the debt deal they supposedly cooked up to benefit themselves never happened. Last month, after a closed-door trial, they were declared guilty. Their sentences range from eight to 13 years. Appeals are expected.<br />Whether the six overstepped their authority at Citgo isn’t clear. But there is no doubt they were denied due process in Venezuela and are pawns in a wider power struggle. On one side of the chess board is strongman Nicolás Maduro. On the other is former Oil Minister and former PdVSA president Rafael Ramírez, now wanted on graft charges. In July Venezuela requested Mr. Ramírez’s extradition from Italy, though according to press reports his whereabouts are unknown.<br />Meanwhile, discrediting the apparatus he built during 12 years at the helm of Venezuelan oil policy is a Maduro priority, which likely explains the hauling in of the Citgo Six. Since the men were also working for a U.S.-based company now controlled by Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó—recognized by more than 50 democracies as the country’s rightful president—their arrest is also a way for Mr. Maduro to show he can still influence Citgo’s fate.</td>

Under the slogan #DisruptTexts, critical-theory ideologues, schoolteachers and  Twitter  agitators are purging and propagandizing against classic texts—everything from Homer to F. Scott Fitzgerald to Dr. Seuss.<br />Their ethos holds that children shouldn’t have to read stories written in anything other than the present-day vernacular—especially those “in which racism, sexism, ableism, anti-Semitism, and other forms of hate are the norm,” as young-adult novelist Padma Venkatraman writes in School Library Journal. No author is valuable enough to spare, Ms. Venkatraman instructs: “Absolving Shakespeare of responsibility by mentioning that he lived at a time when hate-ridden sentiments prevailed, risks sending a subliminal message that academic excellence outweighs hateful rhetoric.”<br />The subtle complexities of literature are being reduced to the crude clanking of “intersectional” power struggles. Thus Seattle English teacher Evin Shinn tweeted in 2018 that he’d “rather die” than teach “The Scarlet Letter,” unless Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel is used to “fight against misogyny and slut-shaming.”<br />Outsiders got a glimpse of the intensity of the #DisruptTexts campaign recently when self-described “antiracist teacher” Lorena Germán complained that many classics were written more than 70 years ago: “Think of US society before then & the values that shaped this nation afterwards. THAT is what is in those books.”<br />Jessica Cluess, an author of young-adult fiction, shot back: “If you think Hawthorne was on the side of the judgmental Puritans . . . then you are an absolute idiot and should not have the title of educator in your twitter bio.”</td>

The diagnosis eventually was reversed and she resumed flying.<br />The ruling supported Ms. Petitt’s claims that she was singled out for special scrutiny to try to keep her quiet about safety issues. Scott Morris, the judge who presided over the long-running litigation, determined that Delta punished and discriminated against a federally protected whistleblower without any evidence indicating her “performance as a pilot was deficient in any way.” According to the decision, “not a single witness questioned her flying acumen.”<br />The ruling says that “in this case, the squeaky wheel did not get the grease.” Instead, “it got unlawfully discriminated against in the form of a career defining” mental-health evaluation. Ms. Petitt has four decades of flying experience and a doctorate in aviation safety. Many inside Delta saw her safety concerns and warnings as valid and told her to brief managers about them, according to the decision, but simultaneously other company officials identified her as a candidate for psychiatric evaluation.<br />Issued before Christmas, the ruling contains strong criticism of Delta’s safety culture and more broadly warns against management’s use of compulsory psychological assessments “for the purposes of obtaining blind compliance by its pilots.”</td>

Holcomb’s advocacy for the tourniquet (“The Military Learned to Stop the Bleeding,” op-ed, Dec. 21): My fraternity at the University of Chicago, Phi Delta Theta, was geared toward physics, not parties. Fiscally constrained, we took in the occasional boarder. Rick Ames was one. We soon recognized him as a seldom-bathed alcoholic and searched for an excuse to kick him out.<br />One night in 1962 we found it—and then some. Rick severed an artery by jabbing his forearm through one of the house’s glass windows. A serpentine trail led me and a friend to a pool of blood.<br />Equally intense emotions of disgust and sympathy pulled me in opposite directions, but my Boy Scout training took over. I squeezed a pressure point to stop the bleeding and tourniqueted Rick’s arm, noting the time in huge magic-marker letters on his forehead.<br />Rick was wrapped in plastic garbage bags, carried over the rugs of the foyer and driven to the emergency room in some reluctant brother’s automobile. The next day our boarder’s bags were gone, his key was returned and he was forgotten.<br />It turns out Rick’s father was a CIA agent who eventually got Rick into the agency. From there Aldrich “Rick” Ames became the most notorious mole in CIA history, betraying at least 12 of America’s best secret agents in the Soviet bloc. Many of them were executed. Alas, I was a few pints of blood away from saving these fellows, but my Boy Scout training doomed them. The tourniquet works.</td>

      <td>The pitcher baffled hitters with a knuckleball and won 318 games over his 24-year major-league career</td>
      <td>Baseball Hall of Famer Phil Niekro, who pitched well into his 40s with a knuckleball that baffled big league hitters for more than two decades, mostly with the Atlanta Braves, has died after a long fight with cancer, the team announced Sunday. He was 81.<br />The Braves said Niekro died Saturday night in his sleep. He lived in the Atlanta suburb of Flowery Branch, where a main thoroughfare bears his name.<br />Niekro won 318 games over his 24-year career, which ended in 1987 at age 48 after he made one final start with the Braves.<br />Niekro also pitched for the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians and Toronto Blue Jays late in his career.<br />“We are heartbroken on the passing of our treasured friend,” the Braves said in a statement. “Knucksie was woven into the Braves fabric, first in Milwaukee and then in Atlanta. Phil baffled batters on the field and later was always the first to join in our community activities. It was during those community and fan activities where he would communicate with fans as if they were long lost friends.”</td>

      <td>The Bills host their first home playoff game in a quarter-century, but fans will likely be kept out.</td>
      <td>The Buffalo Bills have won the AFC East division for the first time in 25 years and secured their first home playoff game in almost as long. Thousands of jubilant Bills fans waited hours in the cold to greet the team, which arrived at the Buffalo airport at 1:30 a.m. after beating the Denver Broncos on Dec. 19 to clinch the division title. The die-hards were restless after being barred from Bills games all season. Whether Bills Stadium will join the 13 others that allow in fans before the playoffs may now depend on the wisdom of Howard Zucker—the state health commissioner, who signed off on New York’s now-infamous March 25 directive barring nursing homes from turning away Covid-positive residents.<br />I grew up in Buffalo in the 1970s and ’80s, lean times for Bills fans. When I left for college in 1990, the team promptly made it to the Super Bowl, but lost when Scott Norwood’s last-minute field-goal attempt drifted wide right. The Bills returned to the Super Bowl during my sophomore, junior and senior years but lost each time. In 1995, when I was 23, the Bills won the division but lost to Pittsburgh in the second playoff round. Little did I know I’d be 48 before when my team won the AFC East again.<br />Suffering is an integral part of being a Buffalo sports fan and so is loyalty. Possibly excepting the Green Bay Packers, I can’t think of a team more closely intertwined with its city’s identity and fortune than the Bills. In an otherwise hellish year, the team and its faithful—affectionately known as the “Bills Mafia”—finally have a reason to be hopeful and proud.<br />The coal in our Bills stockings is the absence of fans in the stadium. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has sent mixed signals about opening up Bills Stadium all season. On Sept. 30, he said he’d tour the stadium and meet with team leadership to “talk through” the issues around reopening. By Nov. 6, he backtracked and said that Dr. Zucker—whose nursing-home order led to the deaths of at least 6,200 people—had told him it would be “reckless” to allow any fans back into the (outdoor) stadium, which has a capacity of more than 71,000.<br />The governor never came to tour the stadium, but he recently said he’d “love nothing more” than to attend a Bills home playoff game. He insisted that Dr. Zucker’s Department of Health needs to green-light any deal to open up the stadium, including a cautious proposal to admit about 6,700 fans.</td>

      <td>Public rebuke is latest step by Beijing to rein in large companies after they took on what financial regulators regarded as excessive risk</td>
      <td>Chinese financial regulators moved to rein in Ant Group Co., the financial-technology giant controlled by billionaire Jack Ma, telling it to switch its focus back to its mainstay payments business and rectify problems in faster-growing areas such as personal lending, insurance and wealth management.<br />China’s central bank on Sunday criticized Ant for its behavior toward competitors and consumers, and what regulators said was problematic corporate governance. It said the company “despised” complying with regulations and engaged in regulatory arbitrage, without providing specifics.<br />The statement from the People’s Bank of China followed a Saturday meeting between the central bank, representatives of Ant, and China’s securities, banking and foreign-exchange regulators. It was presented as a Q&A with the PBOC’s vice governor Pan Gongsheng.<br />The public rebuke came less than two months after Beijing pulled the plug on Ant’s planned initial public offerings in Hong Kong and Shanghai on Nov. 3. The blockbuster IPO had been set to raise at least $34 billion—valuing Ant at more than $300 billion—but Chinese President Xi Jinping personally decided to halt the deal after Mr. Ma infuriated government leaders with a speech in which he criticized financial regulation, The Wall Street Journal has reported.<br />Ant said it appreciated the guidance and would comply with the regulatory requirements. The company said it would develop a timetable and a plan of action.</td>

      <td>Medical centers overrun with critical Covid-19 patients are using just a fraction of allotted supplies of the treatment</td>
      <td>Doses of monoclonal antibodies—Covid-19 therapies authorized for emergency use last month—are sitting unused in hospital pharmacies, even as cases surge across the country.<br />Hospitals say the rollout of the therapies has been stunted by a lukewarm response from infectious-disease specialists, who say they want more clinical trial data before using them on a regular basis. Medical centers are also grappling with a lack of awareness and interest from both the primary-care doctors who would normally prescribe the drug and patients who are offered it. And some places are dealing with a shortage of space and staff to administer the therapies.<br />When monoclonal antibody therapies from  Eli Lilly  & Co. and  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.  were approved for emergency use in November, health agencies were worried there wouldn’t be enough supply to meet demand. Now, health-care providers are administering just 20% of the doses they receive each week, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, the federal initiative to support development of new drugs, vaccines and diagnostics for Covid-19.<br />Monoclonal antibodies, which are also used to treat other diseases, work by taking a page from the body’s own natural antibody defenses, targeting specific spots on intruding pathogens. Eli Lilly’s bamlanivimab and Regeneron’s casirivimab-and-imdevimab cocktail target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and are injected intravenously. Early trial data of the therapies found they could reduce hospitalization or emergency visits among high-risk patients.<br />“Physicians are not ordering the drug,” said Michael Ison, an infectious-disease physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital who is helping lead the monoclonal-antibody rollout there and in the wider Northwestern Medicine health system, which includes 10 hospitals across the Chicago area and northern Illinois.</td>
