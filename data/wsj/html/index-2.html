      <td>Music-streaming giant’s new ventures in podcasting, advertising and artist promotion have a high bar, as valuation has surged</td>
      <td>Spotify  sees itself as much more than a music-streaming platform. Investors have long since gotten there.<br />The company laid out an ambitious vision Monday during a two-hour webcast, touting new and coming offerings for listeners, musicians, podcasters and advertisers. These include a new high-fidelity music-streaming service for subscribers, more tools for musicians and podcasters to expand their revenue streams and significant international expansion that will take the service into 85 new markets this year. For podcasting—which has been of particular interest to investors—Spotify has added a new eight-episode series with former President Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen.<br />A news dump, in other words. And one that pleased investors initially, sending Spotify’s stock price up 5% before a broad-based tech selloff pushed the shares back down into the red by the end of trading Monday. Spotify is still up more than 11% since the start of the year and about 138% over the past 12 months, well outperforming other hot streaming names such as  Netflix  and  Disney .  Shares of  Warner Music Group ,  which as one of the world’s largest record labels controls some of the most sought-after music Spotify’s subscribers listen to, have actually lost about 4% so far this year.<br />Opportunities beyond music streaming are a key draw for Spotify’s investors right now. The stock’s big surge over the past year has mostly come from hype over new podcast deals, with the likes of Joe Rogan, Kim Kardashian and DC Comics. Even the royal family is getting in on the action; Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made a brief appearance in Monday’s event to tout their own exclusive Spotify podcast, coming later this year.<br />But while the number of podcasts on Spotify tripled last year to 2.2 million, the company has yet to break out any financial details of the venture. The highly popular “Joe Rogan Experience” became exclusive to Spotify on Dec. 1, but the company would only say on its fourth-quarter call on Feb. 4 that the program “contributed positively to user growth on the platform.” In a note following the results, Brian Russo of  Credit Suisse  said the company’s outlook for the current year “does little to suggest this content is driving an inflection in the business.”</td>

      <td>Treasury prices rally, but traders worry about a reversal if inflation picks up</td>
      <td>The spread between the two-year Treasury yield and a key interest rate set by the Federal Reserve is the narrowest since the depths of the coronavirus market selloff, a potential sign of financial-system stress.<br />The two-year Treasury yield, which closed Monday at 0.113%, is 0.013 percentage point above the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER. It traded as low as 0.105% earlier in February. The Fed pays banks on the reserves held above and beyond those required by central-bank regulatory policy as part of its effort to maintain liquidity in the financial system.<br />When the coronavirus sent markets and the economy into a tailspin in March, the Fed cut IOER by 1 percentage point to 0.10%—alongside other interventions—to shore up short-term lending markets and support economic activity. The spread between IOER and the two-year yield has typically been above 0.05 percentage point since the Fed cut the rate to its lowest level ever in March.<br />Traders said the shrinking of this spread reflects appetite for short-term debt as investors gobble up safe assets and park their cash. It also highlights a key tension point in financial markets: to what extent is Fed support for markets taking asset prices to unsustainable levels, and how vulnerable does that leave bond markets and other areas exposed to sudden reversals.<br />Analysts have been watching Treasury auction results to gauge whether increased fiscal spending and a supply surge of Treasury bonds would push short-term Treasury prices down and yields up. So far, that hasn’t happened. But bond traders are concerned that inflation could rise in coming months and years as the government prints money to support the economy and cover future borrowing costs.</td>

      <td>Potentially misleading disclosures related to the pandemic attract closer scrutiny from regulators</td>
      <td>After its business was hit by the pandemic, retailer  Ulta Beauty Inc.  appears to have used some accounting cosmetics to add a gloss to its financial results.<br />Operating income at the once-fast-growing chain, which temporarily closed stores during the health crisis, plummeted to $13 million for the nine months through October, a fraction of the $613 million earned in the same period in 2019. Two coronavirus-related items affected the math: a $40 million impairment charge for the value of some stores that reduced the operating income, and $51 million of federal tax credits that increased it.<br />Ulta also reported a much healthier $98 million “adjusted operating income.” This tally, designed to strip out one-time items, added back the $40 million impairment cost, which boosted the adjusted number, but didn’t take off the $51 million of federal aid. If that aid had been removed, the adjusted-operating-income number would have been half of what the company reported.<br />About a year into the pandemic, regulators are ramping up their scrutiny of potentially misleading coronavirus disclosures by companies. A senior Securities and Exchange Commission official warned in December that companies should be consistent in positive and negative adjustments when showing the impact of the pandemic.<br />An Ulta Beauty spokeswoman denied cherry-picking data to flatter the adjusted metric. She said the impairment cost was a legitimate one-time charge caused by the impact of Covid-19 on some stores, not a direct cost of the pandemic such as cleaning supplies.</td>

Democrats have praised Mr. Becerra’s past work defending the Affordable Care Act and abortion access.<br />Mr. Becerra’s hearing Tuesday with the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will be followed by a hearing Wednesday with the Senate Finance Committee, which must vote to advance the confirmation to the floor for a full Senate vote.<br />In the evenly divided Senate, Democrats can confirm Mr. Biden’s nominees without any Republican votes, so long as they don’t lose any votes among their own ranks. Vice President Kamala Harris can cast a tiebreaking vote.<br />“We must ensure people have access to quality, affordable healthcare,” Mr. Becerra said in prepared remarks released ahead of Tuesday’s hearing. “If confirmed, I will work with you to strengthen our Medicare and Medicaid lifelines, reduce the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, and ensure we are accountable, spending resources wisely and effectively.”</td>

      <td>U.S. stock futures edged lower Tuesday as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony in Congress on the health of the economy.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked down 0.1%. The benchmark stocks gauge on Monday fell for a fifth consecutive day, its longest losing streak since last February. Contracts for the Nasdaq-100 retreated 0.6%, suggesting technology stocks will continue to lead the market lower.<br />A sharp rise in yields on U.S. government bonds in recent days has sapped investors’ appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. Shares in technology companies, which have powered the broader market higher for much of the past year, are seen as particularly vulnerable. That is because many tech companies’ valuations are tied to their future earnings potential. Those profits are less valuable in today’s terms when investors apply a higher discount rate.<br />The rise in bond yields “naturally does cause investors and cause markets to re-examine the view on equities,” said Paul Jackson, global head of asset allocation research at Invesco. Investing in government bonds is beginning to look more attractive for the first time in months, he said.<br />But “the level at which bond yields become truly problematic for equities is a long way from where we are now,” Mr. Jackson added.</td>

      <td><br />Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Saudi Arabia’s long-serving oil minister and the public face of the 1973 oil embargo that punctuated the country’s newfound role as an oil-market superpower, has died. He was 90.<br />Mr. Yamani, who suffered from poor health for years, died in London, Saudi state TV announced Tuesday. He is expected to be buried in his hometown of Mecca, his former colleagues said. His son Hani Yamani said he had died on Monday.<br />He served in the post for nearly 25 years, starting in 1962. At that time, the U.S.—not Saudi Arabia—dominated the global oil trade as the world’s biggest producer and consumer of the commodity. The Texas Railroad Commission regulated domestic oil prices, while American and British companies held sway over a chunk of overseas production.<br />When Mr. Yamani took over the oil ministry, Saudi Arabia was a middling producer in the oil-rich Mideast. But Saudi Arabia’s deposits, it turns out, were much bigger than its neighbors’, and soon the country’s output was soaring. Amid a wave of oil field nationalizations across the region, Mr. Yamani led talks to take control of the Saudi Arabia Oil Co., then a joint venture between the predecessors to  Exxon Mobil Corp.  and  Chevron Corp.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—Facebook Inc. reached a deal with the Australian government to restore news pages to the social media company’s platform, following a five-day suspension because of a disagreement over payment for content.<br />Facebook removed news from its platform in Australia last week, as legislation that would effectively require Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to pay traditional media companies for content worked its way through the country’s parliament. The legislation is being widely watched globally and could offer a model for other countries to compel tech giants to pay for content.<br />Facebook got some changes to the legislation as part of the deal. That includes requiring an additional round of negotiation with media companies before binding arbitration kicks in, as well as more acknowledgment of any deals Facebook reaches with publishers on its own, a government statement and government officials said Tuesday. In return, Facebook planned to restore news pages to its platform in Australia in the coming days, the statement said.<br />In a news conference, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told him that the company intends to strike commercial deals with Australian media organizations to pay for content. It did that later Tuesday, when Australian television and newspaper company Seven West Media Ltd. said it agreed to provide news to Facebook, though it didn’t immediately provide any details of the deal.<br />“There’s no doubt that Australia has been a proxy battle for the world,” Mr. Frydenberg said Tuesday. “Facebook and Google have not hidden the fact that they know that the eyes of the world are on Australia.”</td>

But it said it had tweaked its strategy as the pandemic had driven a surge in digital banking, sustainability had grown in importance, and as interest rates were likely to be “lower for longer.”<br />The bank said Tuesday that earnings fell 35% to $3.9 billion last year as the coronavirus pandemic roiled the global economy. HSBC set aside $8.82 billion in provisions for bad loans last year versus less than $3 billion in 2019.<br />Chief Executive Noel Quinn is leading the reorganization, though geopolitical tension has strained his ambition for the bank to be a financial bridge between China and the rest of the world. HSBC last year supported China’s imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong, which the U.S. and British governments opposed.<br />“We plan to focus on and invest in the areas in which we are strongest,” Mr. Quinn said. As part of that, the bank wants to be a market leader in serving rich Asian customers. Other areas that HSBC consider core include retail banking in Hong Kong and Britain, cross-border trade, and facilitating trade and capital flows into and across Asia.</td>

      <td>U.S. air-safety regulators were considering whether to mandate increased inspections of certain Pratt & Whitney engines before one powering a United Airlines Holdings Inc. flight broke apart Saturday over a town near Denver, the Federal Aviation Administration said.<br />The disclosure came as U.S. safety investigators said they found evidence of “damage consistent with metal fatigue” on one of the engine’s fan blades that had been largely ripped off. That loose blade apparently then sheared off part of a second blade that was also fractured, said Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, in a news conference Monday evening.<br />Mr. Sumwalt said investigators are probing why an outer covering known as a cowling detached, as well as why the damaged engine remained on fire even after fuel had been shut off by the flight crew.<br />Last weekend’s incident was third in a string of failures involving the same engine and aircraft types in recent years. American regulators had previously ordered stepped-up inspections of fan blades after an earlier engine failure on another United flight on a Boeing 777 in 2018. Then in December, an engine failed during a  Japan Airlines Co.  flight to Tokyo, prompting the FAA’s fresh scrutiny.<br />The FAA said Monday it had been “evaluating whether to adjust blade inspections” following December’s incident, after reviewing maintenance and inspection records and conducting a metallurgical examination of a fan blade fragment to determine the cause of a fracture in the engine failure.</td>

      <td>MEXICO CITY—The U.S.-born wife of imprisoned drug lordJoaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán was arrested Monday for allegedly helping her husband run his drug empire and carry out an escape from a maximum-security Mexican prison, the U.S. Justice Department said.<br />Emma Coronel, 31 years old, who married Mr. Guzmán when she was a teenage beauty queen, was arrested at Washington’s Dulles airport. For five years, as her husband was on the run and in prison, Ms. Coronel acted as Mr. Guzmán’s courier, sending instructions to associates that dealt with increasing heroin production, paying bribes, buying weapons, and trying to bust Mr. Guzmán out of prison, according to an arrest affidavit.<br />Ms. Coronel, believed to be Mr. Guzmán’s third or fourth wife, is charged with conspiring to distribute heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana in the U.S., according to the affidavit, signed by a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent. She couldn’t be reached for comment. Court records don’t list an attorney for Ms. Coronel.<br />The arrest of Ms. Coronel could add new friction to U.S.-Mexico relations. It comes months after the October arrest in Los Angeles of Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos, Mexico’s former defense minister, as he and his family arrived on a family vacation. A month later, U.S. officials dropped charges after Mexico complained that it had been kept in the dark about the U.S. investigation and threatened to cut off antidrug cooperation.<br />The former general was then returned to Mexico where he was eventually cleared of charges after Mexican prosecutors said the U.S. case was weak. The U.S. Department of Justice said it stood by its case.</td>

Its stock, trading around $40 in after hours trading Monday, implied a valuation for Lucid of more than $65 billion. That compares with the roughly $75 billion market capitalization of General Motors Co., which posted a pretax profit of $9.7 billion last year while selling approximately 6.8 million vehicles world-wide.<br />The deal shows the extraordinary appetite among stock investors for SPACs, particularly anything relating to electric vehicles. Amid the soaring value of  Tesla Inc.’s  shares in the past year, investors have rushed into startups in the sector, injecting hundreds of millions of dollars into new companies like  Fisker Inc.  and  Lordstown Motors Corp. —startups that announced deals to go public when they had employee counts in the dozens and had yet to create any revenue.</td>

There’s no such thing, there’s nothing ordinary about them,” Mr. Biden said during a speech at the White House. “People we lost were extraordinary.

Nearly a year ago, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.<br />“We have been fighting this pandemic for so long. We have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow. We have to resist viewing each life as a statistic,” Mr. Biden said, as he referenced the grief he felt after the deaths of his wife, daughter and son. “That black hole in your chest, you feel like you’re being sucked into it.

      <td>U.S. Supreme Court removed a hurdle for criminal probe when it rejected former president’s efforts to block subpoena for his financial records</td>
      <td>Manhattan prosecutors won a significant court victory in their fraud investigation into Donald Trump’s businesses after the U.S. Supreme Court denied the former president’s attempt to block a subpoena of his financial records.<br />Prosecutors had argued in court filings that Mr. Trump’s effort to keep his tax and financial records secret posed a significant obstacle to their complex financial investigation into possible bank, insurance and tax fraud. Now, the district attorney’s office will likely get the records from Mr. Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA LLP, within days, former prosecutors said.<br />Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance’s office hasn’t said publicly what it hopes to find in Mr. Trump’s tax records.  Former prosecutors said they may want to compare information on the tax records with documents they have already obtained. Mr. Vance’s office has subpoenaed information from Mr. Trump’s lenders and an insurer. Prosecutors also subpoenaed the New York City Tax Commission, which handles tax appeals, a city spokeswoman confirmed.<br />They may be looking for discrepancies between information submitted to tax authorities and financial institutions, which could point investigators to possible red flags. Knowingly submitting false information to a financial institution, and obtaining certain loans as a result, can be a New York state crime, former prosecutors said.<br />Investigators could be looking for “disparities that would show that on one hand, Trump was telling the IRS that he was completely broke, and on the other hand, telling financial institutions he was extremely rich,” said Duncan Levin, a former Manhattan prosecutor who isn’t involved in the current investigation and now works at the firm Tucker Levin.</td>

Kennedy International Airport were thrown a lifeline Monday when New York City extended the airport’s lease to 2060.<br />Plans to redevelop the airport in Queens stalled last year as the coronavirus pandemic decimated passenger numbers and airline revenue world-wide.<br />The airport’s operator, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, has spent the past year renegotiating deals with private-sector consortiums of airlines, terminal operators and developers, who were expected to finance more than $10 billion of the redevelopment plans.<br />But the negotiations were hampered by the airport lease, which was set to expire in 2050, leaving investors with too little time to complete lengthy construction projects, recoup costs and make a profit.<br />Seth Lehman, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, said Mayor Bill de Blasio’s decision Monday to extend the lease by 10 years should help developers secure financing and continue the airport’s modernization.</td>

      <td>Amazon bans a book as Democrats demand a wider media crackdown.</td>
      <td>Now that voters have turned the authoritarian GOP out of the executive branch and Congress, Americans should expect the open exchange of ideas to flourish again. Right?<br />Consider two events Monday. First, the conservative scholar Ryan Anderson announced that  Amazon  had purged his 2018 book, “When Harry Became Sally,” from its web store. The book criticizes recent progressive ideas about gender and especially the wisdom of sex-change procedures in children.<br />Amazon declined comment on the reasons for the ban, but comment is hardly needed. The tech companies have grown increasingly open about their ideological censorship.<br />Also on Monday, two Congressional Democrats wrote a stern letter to CEO Jeff Bezos about Amazon’s role in politics. If you took seriously the party’s promises to defend “democratic norms,” you might expect Democratic politicians would express concern about the world’s third-largest company by market capitalization trying to suppress a book on a contested political issue.<br />But the letter is a demand for more ideological censorship. “Our country’s public discourse is plagued by misinformation, disinformation, conspiracy theories, and lies,” write Reps. Anna Eshoo and Jerry McNerney. They quote a claim that right-wing media is “much more susceptible,” and demand to know why Amazon’s Fire TV carries certain conservative programs.</td>

      <td>The Justices demur on a case over Pennsylvania’s 10,000 late ballots.</td>
      <td>The Supreme Court on Monday declined to rein in last year’s judicial rewrite of Pennsylvania election law, despite three dissenting votes. What a missed opportunity to prevent future mischief. President Biden won by enough votes in enough states that this case wouldn’t change the outcome. But it could have cut the odds of a meltdown next time.<br />“Changing the rules in the middle of the game is bad enough,” Justice Clarence Thomas writes in his solo dissent. “Such rule changes by officials who may lack authority to do so is even worse.” The Constitution gives state legislatures the power to decide the “manner” of elections, but courts and officials last year ignored black-letter law.<br />Pennsylvania legislators unambiguously said mail ballots were due by 8 p.m. on Nov. 3. Yet the state Supreme Court, gesturing at a vague guarantee of “free and equal” elections, ruled that late-arriving votes would be valid through Nov. 6, even without proof of when they were mailed. In total, 10,097 tardy ballots showed up, 669 lacking legible postmarks. That’s plenty to create havoc in a tighter election.<br />In Minnesota, a Democratic state official settled a lawsuit from a progressive group by agreeing to accept mailed ballots a week past the legal deadline. Five days before Nov. 3, a federal court ordered those ballots—2,460 arrived and were counted, plus 802 rejected for still being late—kept separate, in case they had to be tossed. In other states, deadlines were extended and reverted by different judges.<br />Voters might not know which instructions to follow. Both campaigns might declare victory, which is what happened in a Pennsylvania state Senate race amid a dispute over undated ballots, as Justice Thomas recounts. “The decision to leave election law hidden beneath a shroud of doubt is baffling,” he writes.</td>

      <td>Some states’ tax revenues, finances are better than officials had projected when Covid-19 pandemic first hit</td>
      <td>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is expected to propose making a full payment to the state’s chronically underfunded pension system for the first time since 1996, a sign that the blow from the pandemic to all states’ finances isn’t as brutal as officials originally feared.<br />Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, will call for a $6.4 billion payment to the pension system in his budget address Tuesday, senior members of his administration said. The Murphy administration has been ramping up pension payments and originally intended on making a payment of $5.76 billion for the fiscal year that begins in July.<br />In New Jersey, as in many other states, tax revenues have outperformed earlier projections. When the pandemic hit, states projected revenue would drop off significantly. State revenues ended up falling 1.6% in fiscal year 2020 and were 3.4% lower than projected before the pandemic, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. While states expect revenues to fall 4.4% in fiscal 2021, which ends on June 30 for most, 18 states are seeing revenues come in above forecasts.<br />Federal aid for businesses and households helped prop up incomes and consumer spending across the U.S. Unemployment fell and economic activity picked up much faster than expected.<br />State and local budget shortfalls have been at the center of discussions in Washington since last spring over what to include in another economic relief package.</td>

      <td>The Trump years left the U.S. ceding ground for its exports. Biden can regain it, with the help of allies.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s announcement that America is back—ready to engage in the diplomacy that has been a hallmark of our leadership for generations—was music to the ears of those who believe U.S. leadership is essential to global order. Unfortunately, trade didn’t make the cut when the president outlined diplomatic priorities. This merits rethinking.<br />The U.S. and China are engaged in a strategic competition that will determine the shape of global politics this century. But when it comes to trade, a critical dimension of that competition, America is ceding the field.<br />In recent years, the U.S. has imposed unilateral tariffs and trade barriers on allies and adversaries alike. Controls on the trade of technology, while important for national security, have been unnecessarily broad and often unilateral. The U.S. withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). And it has, through a mixture of negligence and obstruction, hobbled the World Trade Organization. These actions undermined America’s leadership of the global trade system, to the dismay of our allies and partners and to the detriment of our firms and workers.<br />At the same time, China has expanded its trade footprint. Already the world’s largest exporter, China is rapidly displacing the U.S. as the largest trade partner for much of the world. Ninety countries traded twice as much with China as with America in 2018. Last year China surpassed the U.S. as the largest recipient of foreign direct investment.<br />As part of its global campaign, China signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership last year, a trade agreement that includes U.S. allies such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. It signed an investment agreement with the European Union in December and has announced a customs initiative with Eastern European countries. Beijing is planning new trade agreements with countries in the Middle East and Africa, as well as a regional agreement with Japan and South Korea.</td>

      <td>The link between sports fandom and physical and mental health is well documented. But the greatest beneﬁt is an appreciation for fair play.</td>
      <td>The main message of Larry Olmsted’s informative “Fans: How Watching Sports Makes Us Happier, Healthier, and More Understanding” is that sports fandom is good for you. People who support a sports team are on balance less depressed, less lonely, less angry, less tense, more extroverted and more satisfied with their social lives. And this mental buoyancy is by no means the end of it. As Mr. Olmsted explains, fans are also smarter, richer, more educated and physically more active. By the end of the book I was starting to feel sorry for all the poor saps who can’t see the point of sport. How do they live?<br />Mr. Olmsted, a journalist and the author of “Real Food/Fake Food,” has plenty of scientific references to back up his claims. Still, as he is aware, it is not always clear which is the cause and which is the effect. Are the benefits due to the fandom, or the other way around? It isn’t hard to see how rooting for a team might raise your spirits—it enrolls you in a ready-made community and keeps you entertained through the long winter evenings. But in other cases the story is less straightforward.<br />Take the association Mr. Olmsted cites between fandom and higher academic grades. Perhaps watching sports does do something to quicken your wits. But it seems just as likely that a sharp mind is a requirement for signing up in the first place. Football, for instance, can be daunting in its complexity. As someone who did not grow up with the sport, I can testify to the commitment and study needed to appreciate its finer points. It is a wonderful game, but it is not designed to appeal to those with limited powers of analysis and concentration.<br />The same question about direction of causation arises with fandom and physical fitness. Mr. Olmsted describes how the Olympics and other high-profile sporting events lead to increases in the number of people who go running, cycling or skiing. But he doesn’t extend the argument to the main American spectator sports. One can see why. It is a curious quirk of history that the U.S. has ended up with leading sports that are not only intellectually demanding but simply too physically difficult for ordinary mortals to play. Perhaps it is true that football fans have above-average fitness. But that is certainly not due to their fandom’s moving them off their couches and onto the playing field.<br />The rest of the world provides an interesting comparison. Mr. Olmsted’s focus is by no means exclusively American, and he notes more than once that soccer and cricket are the dominant sports world-wide. But he fails to observe that, by contrast with American spectator sports, both soccer and cricket are open to anybody who is able-bodied, and are supported by huge pyramids of amateur leagues, with millions participating well into their middle years. It would have been interesting to know if any comparative data show that this international contrast matters to the connection between fandom and physical fitness.</td>

      <td>What if it had been up to Congress to choose the president Jan. 6?</td>
      <td>After the Jan. 6 riot ended, Congress proceeded with the formality of certifying the presidential election. But imagine how contentious the day might have been if Congress’s role had been more than a formality. If no candidate had achieved an Electoral College majority—because of either a three-party split, faithless electors or a 269-269 tie—Congress would have chosen the president.<br />Absent an electoral majority, the 12th Amendment requires the House (the newly elected one, seated on Jan. 3) to choose the president from among the top three finishers. But representatives don’t vote individually. Instead, each state delegation casts a single vote for president from the top three finishers, and a majority of states are needed—a constitutional anomaly, as it departs from the House’s democratic structure. In the current House, although the Democrats have a slim majority, Republican state delegations outnumber Democratic ones, 27-20 (the Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania delegations are evenly split). The current House would presumably elect a Republican despite its Democratic majority.<br />But if the House had more evenly split delegations—23 states have an even number of seats—it is entirely possible that no candidate could get the required majority of 26 states in the House. Likewise in a three-candidate race. If that came to pass, the vice president-elect—chosen by the Senate from the top two candidates absent an electoral majority—would become acting president on Inauguration Day.<br />This process poses potential conflicts of interest for congressional leaders. In an evenly split Senate, the incumbent vice president would cast the deciding vote. In eight of the past 10 elections, the vice president was on his party’s ticket. And if Congress fails to choose either a president or a vice president, the House speaker would become acting president on Jan. 20.<br />Another problem: What if the House elects a president of one party and the Senate elects a vice president of the other? The vice presidency was once an administrative backwater, but these days the vice president has an office in the West Wing and participates in the most intimate discussions of the administration as it develops policies. A partisan rivalry would likely prompt the president to exclude the vice president. But then the vice president wouldn’t be ready to take over if the president leaves office or is temporarily incapacitated.</td>

      <td>For progressives, Asian-American achievement is an embarrassment.</td>
      <td>The North Thurston Public Schools in Lacey, Wash., made headlines in November when their “equity report” classified Asian-Americans along with whites instead of as “students of color.” Apparently the Asian-Americans were doing too well academically to be students of color. After what the district said was “an overwhelming public response,” it admitted its “category choices” had “racist implications” and dropped the equity report from its website.<br />To normal Americans, it makes no sense. How are Asian-Americans not “people of color”? But give the North Thurston folks credit for following progressive logic to its conclusion. Modern progressive theory more or less divides the nation between the oppressors, defined as whites, and the oppressed, defined as everyone else. In this framework, achieving success puts you on the side of the oppressors and thus makes you white or “white-adjacent”—even if your family came from China or India.<br />Calling it progressive to send children of color the message that achievement is white is an irony lost on the woke. Bigoted laws such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 or actions such as the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II were once thought among the worst stains on American history left by anti-Asian racism. But these days the characterization of Asian-Americans as the “model minority” triggers the woke.<br />“Asian-Americans are caught in a bind—condemn the system of white supremacy and privilege along with other people of color or be ‘banished’ from the victim group as white-adjacent,” says Wenyuan Wu, executive director of Californians for Equal Rights. “The end goal here is to pit people against each other as if our hyphenated identities are bigger than our common destiny as Americans.”<br />The principal reason for this is the fact of Asian-American achievement. This is an embarrassment to progressives because it undermines the claim that structural racism dooms nonwhite citizens to the margins of the American dream. So Asian-American achievement must either be dismissed as somehow white or sacrificed at the altar of equity.</td>

      <td>As climate moves to the center of the world stage, activists will lose influence over policy.</td>
      <td>President Biden laid down a climate marker in his inaugural address: “A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear.” He returned to the theme in his speech last week to the Munich Security Conference, calling the climate crisis “existential.”<br />For environmentalists, those are welcome words. The Trump years saw the U.S. leave the Paris Agreement while pursuing aggressive deregulation at home. Climate change is now back on the national agenda.<br />There are two mistakes observers can make about this new era of climate diplomacy. The first is to think it won’t last or will be limited to rhetoric. Climate skeptics and fossil-fuel interests should brace themselves. The fight to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions and to shift the world’s energy systems toward much lower emissions isn’t going away. Key positions up and down the government bureaucracy will be filled by committed greens who have thought long and hard about how to use the powers of the regulatory state to achieve green goals. A host of new policies—and new regulations—are sure to come.<br />Those who dismiss ideas like the “green new deal” as mere left-wing fantasies miss the enormous appeal of these programs for corporations looking for new business opportunities. It isn’t only renewable energy companies looking for government mandates and funding. It’s major auto manufacturers dreaming of replacing every gasoline-powered car and truck on the planet with an electric vehicle—and reaping the public-relations reward of looking virtuous. It’s construction companies looking to replace the existing energy infrastructure.<br />But if skeptics underestimate the effect the climate movement will have on the world’s economy, greens are in danger of overestimating how much their efforts will help the polar bears. Paradoxically, as climate change assumes a more prominent place on the international agenda, climate activists will lose influence over climate policy.</td>

Mr. Neumann stepped down under pressure as CEO in the wake of the IPO debacle.<br />The negotiations have been rocky at times and there is no guarantee they will produce an agreement, but if there is one, it could be finalized in the coming days, the people said.<br />Should there be a settlement, it could be followed by another deal as WeWork is also in talks to combine with a special-purpose acquisition company, a move that would finally convert it into a public company.</td>

      <td>Seattle Mariners chief executive Kevin Mather resigned Monday after the public revelation of a disastrous appearance before a local Rotary Club, in which he disparaged foreign players for their English skills, potentially alienated top prospects heralded as the franchise’s saviors and insulted the team’s most veteran leader.<br />If that weren’t enough, Mather also incurred the wrath of Major League Baseball and the players’ union by admitting to what the Major League Baseball Players Association views as bad-faith tactics teams use to delay their top prospects’ free agency. That topic is a running hot spot in the tense relationship between the two sides, at a time when they are about to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement.<br />For that reason, the fallout from Mather’s virtual appearance at a Bellevue Breakfast Rotary Club event earlier this month will continue to reverberate long after he disappears from the sport. His remarks to the local Rotarians, which surfaced on YouTube over the weekend, provided a rare glimpse into the inner workings of MLB’s executive class at a perilous moment for the game’s future.<br />The Mariners sought to depict their highest-ranking employee as a lone actor rather than a representative of MLB’s values. “[Mather’s] comments were inappropriate and do not represent our organization’s feelings about our players, staff and fans,” Mariners chairman John Stanton said Monday afternoon. The Mariners have not made the playoffs since 2001, the longest drought in major North American professional sports.<br />As baseball gears up for its most contentious labor battle this year since the strike of 1994, the players’ union seized on Mather’s speech. It described his comments as  “a highly disturbing yet critically important window into how players are genuinely viewed by management “ that “represents an unfiltered look into club thinking.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The House Budget Committee approved the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package Monday, setting up a vote in the full House later this week.<br />The Budget Committee on Monday officially fused together different portions of the legislation that had advanced earlier this month in nine different House committees. A full House vote is expected Friday or Saturday.<br />The bill moving through the House would provide $400-a-week unemployment benefits through Aug. 29, send $1,400 per-person payments to most households, provide billions in funding for schools and vaccine distribution, expand the child tax credit, broaden child-care assistance and bolster tax credits for health insurance. It would also increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over four years, a point of division among Democrats.<br />“We are in a race against time. Aggressive, bold action is needed before our nation is more deeply and permanently scarred by the human and economic costs of inaction,” House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D., Ky.) said Monday before the vote. “We are going to pass this legislation and we are going to turn this pandemic and economic crisis around.”<br />In the past month, new Covid-19 cases have declined as vaccines rolled out to more Americans, and economists have upgraded their outlooks for the year. But officials including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have said the $1.9 trillion package is needed to dig out of the economic slump induced by the pandemic.</td>

      <td>At last, Joe Biden, Anthony Fauci and CNN are no longer presenting New York Democrat Andrew Cuomo as the model governor in pandemic response. The question now is how many lives were lost due to his reckless policy of forcing vulnerable populations to accept greater risk of infection—and then hiding the results. Nursing homes were not the only places forced to accept Covid-positive patients.<br />Maria McFadden Maffucci writes at National Review: “Cuomo’s edicts put another vulnerable population in inexcusable peril: New Yorkers with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) living in group homes.” Ms. Maffucci writes:<br />Guess how that worked out for disabled New Yorkers. As is Cuomo custom, the state government withheld crucial information from public disclosure. Therefore scientists and policy makers had to try to make sense of limited data. Ms. Maffucci says that researchers often had to rely on voluntary reporting from advocacy organizations.<br />The available data told another highly disturbing story. Last year a study in Disability and Health Journal titled “COVID-19 outcomes among people with intellectual and developmental disabilities living in residential homes in New York state” reported some dismal statistics:<br />If the Cuomo government ever allows a full accounting, perhaps researchers can estimate the precise impact of the directive to facilities on accepting Covid-positive patients.</td>

      <td>An anti-inflammatory drug can help reduce the risk of death in people hospitalized with Covid-19, a new clinical trial indicates, reviving hopes—and debate—about a medicine that many physicians had abandoned after earlier clinical-trial failures.<br />A U.K. study of more than 4,000 hospitalized patients showed that people who received the rheumatoid arthritis drug tocilizumab plus steroids had a 20% lower risk of death after 28 days compared with patients who received steroids and standard care only, according to preliminary results posted online this month.<br />The results haven’t been published yet in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, but U.S. scientists are paying attention to them because of the reputation of the University of Oxford researchers who conducted the study. In June, the same Oxford researchers were the first to prove that the cheap and widely available steroid dexamethasone significantly reduced Covid-19 deaths, a finding that led to the drug becoming a standard treatment for most hospitalized patients.<br />Researchers say Oxford’s study may have succeeded where others failed because it included a much larger number of patients, whose average age was about 63, and included only patients with high inflammation measured in lab tests and low blood-oxygen. The data could lead to the drugs becoming more widely used, especially if they are included as suggested or recommended treatments in guidelines crafted by influential organizations such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health or the Infectious Diseases Society of America.<br />“There have been a lot of studies before this one that suggested a possible benefit and others that seemed not quite as compelling,” said Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. “I think what we were waiting for was a really large scale, well-designed study—and I think we may now have that.”</td>

Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement the agency is seeking “efficient ways to modify medical products that either are in the pipeline or have been authorized for emergency use to address emerging variants.”<br />The agency also announced new guidelines for makers of diagnostic tests and monoclonal-antibody drugs about how those companies can best adapt their products to address mutations now cropping up in the U.S.<br />Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s center for biological products, which evaluates vaccines, told reporters Monday the analysis of whether vaccines prevent the new strains of Covid-19 will involve a few hundred research subjects over a couple of months. That would be faster than vaccine trials, which so far have involved thousands of research subjects over several months, followed by an FDA analysis.<br />The federal agency has been criticized for taking up to three weeks just to analyze the clinical study of a new vaccine from  Johnson & Johnson .  J&J said its vaccine was 72% effective in the U.S. in preventing moderate to severe Covid-19 infection. This compared with 57% in South Africa, where the mutant strain has been prominently present.</td>

While vaccines also suppress new infections, the effect isn’t as pronounced.<br />The information appears to vindicate the U.K.’s policy of stretching limited vaccine supplies by delaying a second shot to up to 12 weeks after the first, while also emphasizing the extra protection that comes from a second shot.<br />The data include an analysis of the effect of vaccinations among the elderly, a study looking at infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare workers, and a broad look at vaccinations in Scotland that covered more than five million people.</td>

      <td>Regarding Alan S. Blinder’s “The Risks of Skimping on Covid Relief” (op-ed, Feb. 18): I might have agreed with Prof. Blinder if the problem today was one of inadequate aggregate demand, as it was in the 1930s and after 2008, but that is not the situation. His focus on traditional macroeconomic policy misses that today’s needs are to help the specific sectors impacted by the pandemic and the people suffering the greatest negative impact from it. It isn’t a problem of inadequate aggregate demand nor an issue of widespread, across-the-board unemployment. Look at the increase in savings rates and the all-time highs in the stock market to realize that sending checks based on prior years’ income with no attempt to target the aid to people who actually were hurt by the pandemic wasn’t the proper policy.<br />How can sending checks to a retired couple whose combined  income has remained steady at $150,000 a year in any way address the problems we currently are facing? A household with school-age children and adults who are now working at home and drawing the same (if not higher) salaries they did in 2019 would be much better served by programs aimed at getting schools reopened rather than receiving a stimulus check. There is no benefit to the travel-industry workers who have lost their jobs nor the restaurant workers whose places of employment close. These are the people who need help. Increasing aggregate demand won’t lead to more demand for air travel, rental cars and hotel stays as long as people are afraid to travel, nor will it increase restaurant employment as long as these places are precluded from being fully open due to health-department restrictions.<br />Bill Powar<br />Palo Alto, Calif.<br /></td>

      <td>The transportation sector currently represents more than 28% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.</td>
      <td>Holman Jenkins’s “EVs Are the Lowest Climate Priority” (Business World, Feb. 10) completely misses the mark. The transportation sector currently represents more than 28% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions per data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency—more than any other sector of the U.S. economy. Cars and light-duty trucks make up nearly 60% of those emissions, without any noticeable decrease in recent years. By way of contrast, carbon emissions from the U.S. power sector are at their lowest level in more than 30 years and continue to fall, as nearly 40% of our nation’s electricity comes from carbon-free sources.<br />Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time, and America’s investor-owned electric companies are well-positioned to continue to be part of the climate solution. This includes taking advantage of the great strides made from emissions reductions in the electric sector to help reduce transportation-sector emissions by increasing the number of nonemitting electric vehicles on U.S. roads. In other words, EVs are a top climate priority and an effective and proven lever to reduce emissions.<br />We look forward to leveraging our progress and to working with the Biden administration on policies that help drive electrification and reduce emissions from the transportation sector.<br />Tom Kuhn<br />President</td>

Additionally, there are critical pre-emptive measures, focusing global surveillance on origins of viral transmission, that will significantly reduce such needs in the first place: We know that over 62% of human emerging diseases derive from zoonoses, a disproportionate number in selected taxa (particularly bats, carnivores, rodents), and in those species that geographically reside mainly in Asia, tropical Africa and latitudinal/longitudinal hot spot regions. Together with information about which populations of these species are closer in proximity to humans, a comprehensive global network will complement organizational changes and provide early warning signals to curtail the chances of future pandemics.

      <td>What do you do when the facts change? If policy makers stick to their priors, they risk inflation.</td>
      <td>‘When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?”<br />There are competing accounts of the authorship of this affirmation of the importance of empiricism to the intellectual method. It used to be claimed for John Maynard Keynes. As with almost every quotable observation of the last 150 years it has been attributed to Winston Churchill. Most people now think it was more likely the work of Paul Samuelson.<br />Whoever said it first, it seems almost quaintly nostalgic in our age of individual epistemic autonomy, when facts are infinitely fungible and take second place to our ideological priors. An updated version of the adage might be: When the facts change, I deny them, ascribe them to some malevolent opponent, and then imagine another set of facts that allow me to leave my mind unchanged. What do you do, sir?<br />We’ve seen plenty of this epistemic nimbleness in the last year, with scientific claims that large gatherings threaten public health except when they’re in service of racial justice, or that political violence threatens public order only when it comes from the right.<br />As Samuelson could attest, economics is more prone to the temptations of fact-selectivity than any other discipline, and our current macroeconomic policy debate is no exception.</td>

      <td>The lack of frank debate feeds Islamists and the far right, who would impose illiberal solutions.</td>
      <td>The European debate on immigration, integration and Islam has intensified. In part this is a response to terrorist attacks, the preaching of radical Islam, and the re-emergence of extreme right-wing and populist parties. But the big, underlying change has been the influx of migrants from the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.<br />More than 3.7 million people have arrived illegally in Europe since 2009, the majority of whom have applied for asylum. Roughly half arrived in 2015 alone. Two-thirds of the newcomers were male. Around 80% of asylum applicants were under 35. The great majority have come from Muslim-majority countries.<br />The flow of migrants has abated in the past few years, but large numbers of people still attempt to reach Europe, even during the pandemic. Last year Europe saw more than 336,000 first-time asylum applications and 114,300 illegal entries from January through November.<br />One consequence has been a change in the position of women in Europe. Many Muslim migrants don’t feel or express contempt for women. But some do—enough to drive a trend.<br />One shocking event that drew attention to this trend was the wave of sexual assaults on New Year’s Eve 2015-16 in Germany. According to German police, more than 1,200 women were assaulted, of whom 24 said they were raped. The perpetrators often acted in gangs, attacking lone women. Of 153 suspects in the city of Cologne, nearly all were foreign, including 103 from Morocco and Algeria. Sixty-eight were asylum seekers.</td>

The 49-year old exile, who ran a furniture shop in Cape Town, was making a delivery to a customer when he was attacked.<br />Police, who announced their inquiry late Sunday, said a preliminary investigation points to robbery as a motive. But the Rwanda National Congress party, many of whose senior members are living in exile, said the killing was an assassination that followed a pattern of murders ordered by the Rwandan government against opponents inside and outside the country.<br />“While investigations are going on to determine the exact cause of Mr. Bamporiki’s assassination, the incident resembles assassinations that happened before, where the victims were lured by people they knew; but who fatally betrayed them to death,” the party said.<br />A Rwandan government spokesman didn’t respond to calls for comment. The government has denied that it targets dissidents abroad. Some pro-Rwandan government accounts on Twitter blamed the killing on the infighting within the ranks of Rwanda National Congress party.</td>

      <td>A group of activist investors thinks  Kohl’s  can do better, but that may be easier said than done.<br />An investor consortium with a combined 9.5% stake in Kohl’s is attempting to take control of the department-store chain’s board, nominating nine to its 12-person board. The investors are calling for a plan to grow sales and are pitching a sale-leaseback of some of Kohl’s real-estate assets, among other changes.<br />But Kohl’s faces industrywide problems. For more than a decade now, department stores have been losing market share to discounters, which grew quickly starting in the recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis. The pandemic has made things worse with online retail grabbing more share and apparel brands shifting focus to direct-to-consumer sales.<br />In fact, Kohl’s is the best-performing of the struggling bunch, making it a curious target for activists. For the nine-month period ended Oct. 31, 2020, its top line declined 26% from a year earlier.  Macy’s ,   Nordstrom  and  Dillard’s  all lost roughly 35% in the same period. Both operating margins and returns on invested capital declined between 2011 and 2019 at Kohl’s, but its numbers are still mostly better than those peers.<br />Sale-leasebacks could help juice returns for a while, but holding on to assets isn’t such a bad strategy either. Macy’s, for example, managed to raise $3.15 billion in credit last year to bolster liquidity, using its real estate as collateral. The move helped the department-store chain distance itself from bankruptcy.</td>

Elizabeth Dole, and the room collectively had almost seven decades in the Senate.)<br />“It was just Bob and Joe, not Mr. President,” Mr. Dole said in describing their meeting in an interview afterward. The two men, one a working-class kid from Scranton, Pa., and the other a farmland boy from Kansas, overlapped in the Senate for almost a quarter of a century. Mr. Dole eventually became the Republican leader, Mr. Biden a powerful Democratic committee chairman.<br />Yet they have another, more personal bond. Both have survived grievous hardships in their lives. Mr. Dole endured body-shattering wounds on a World War II battlefield, and Mr. Biden the deaths of a wife and two children. Both found ways to march on. So perhaps it isn’t surprising that they have an amicable relationship: “We were friends then, and we are friends now,” Mr. Dole said.<br />Naturally, these two friends discussed why the Senate they both love—and really, all of Washington—doesn’t work better right now. And maybe, as Bob Dole heads into battle once more, this time against cancer at the age of 97, his advice again can offer courage and wisdom to a capital that seems short of both.<br />“We did talk about how we were able to work together in the Senate when we both were there, one a Democrat, one a Republican,” said Mr. Dole. “We worked across the aisle and we compromised. We couldn’t solve everything, but most everything we could work out.”</td>

Lockdowns and the lack of travel have caused many gathering places to close or reduce their staff. Since February 2020, the leisure-and-hospitality sector has shed nearly four million people, or roughly a quarter of its workforce. As of January 2021, 15.9% of the industry’s workers remained unemployed; more than any other industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br />As a result, millions of hospitality workers—a group that includes everyone from front-desk clerks to travel managers—are trying to launch new careers. Some have transitioned to roles that tap skills honed over years of public-facing work in high-pressure environments. Others have seized the moment to remake themselves for different occupations. Many remain conflicted about leaving an industry they say continually provides new experiences and engenders lasting relationships.<br />A year ago, Ellen White was head trainer at Public Kitchen on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. There, she schooled the restaurant’s workers on the finer points of high-end service.<br />Ms. White supported herself working in restaurants for nearly two decades while acting, until she was furloughed from her restaurant job when the pandemic took hold last spring.

It also said it had raised more than a half-billion dollars at a valuation of $29.5 billion for the company, a sevenfold increase from a funding round less than a year earlier.<br />However, Roblox’s listing plans hit another snag earlier this month when the Securities and Exchange Commission requested changes to how it accounted for the sale of virtual currency called Robux. The company said those issues have since been addressed.<br />Roblox, founded in 2004, makes a free online platform with tens of millions of games. The company’s user base soared through the pandemic as stay-at-home orders meant more people spending time online. It counted nearly 33 million daily active users last year, up from about 18 million the year prior.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Treasury may be able to facilitate climate stress tests on U.S. banks and insurers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday, though the tests likely wouldn’t impose capital requirements or limit dividend payouts as existing stress tests do.<br />Ms. Yellen, speaking at the New York Times DealBook conference, said the tests would be carried out by the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators and not the Treasury. But she said the Treasury, which helps shape regulatory policy toward U.S. financial firms, may be able to facilitate the tests.<br />“I think it’s not envisioned that this would have the same status in terms of limiting payouts and capital requirements,” she said, referring to the annual bank stress tests the Federal Reserve already conducts. “But I think they would be very revealing both to regulators and to the firms themselves in terms of managing their own risks.”<br />Ms. Yellen has said she intends to create a hub within the Treasury to review the tax policy incentives and financial stability risks related to climate change and will appoint a senior official to lead the review.<br />Regulators around the world have warned of the dangers climate change poses to the financial system, including the risk of more severe weather events such as flooding or wildfires that threaten physical assets that underpin bank loans. Banks’ business may also be altered as countries reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, including more widespread use of electric vehicles and shifts to renewable energy resources.</td>

      <td>Is it possible to choose which Covid-19 vaccine you get?<br />For now, you’re unlikely to have a choice. Medical experts say it’s important to take whichever vaccine is offered to you, and both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that are currently authorized in the U.S. have been shown to be highly effective at preventing disease. As vaccine supply increases and more options become available in the coming months and years, there may be more scope for doctors to recommend  different types of shots for different populations.<br />Currently, there is a little bit of wiggle room for people who are determined to get one vaccine over another. People who have registered for vaccination can try to call vaccine sites directly to find out whether they have  Pfizer  or Moderna shots. But many places don’t inform people ahead of time about which vaccine they will get during the appointment.<br />In the early stages of the rollout, Pfizer’s vaccine has been more likely to be offered in hospitals, medical centers or large vaccine sites that have the ultracold storage that it was initially believed to need. Moderna’s shots, by contrast, have had less-extreme cold-storage requirements, making them more accessible for smaller pharmacies or offices in addition to larger venues. But now a new study has indicated that Pfizer’s vaccine can be stored and transported at temperatures similar to what a consumer freezer provides. If the FDA approves the change, that should make Pfizer’s vaccine more accessible.<br />If and when the FDA authorizes the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, it’s also likely to help serve areas without access to high-grade cold storage, says Kathleen Neuzil, director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.</td>

      <td>THE FOUR FOUNDERS of Fubu—childhood friends Daymond John, J. Alexander Martin, Keith Perrin and Carlton Brown—never imagined the fashion brand would make it this far. As Mr. Perrin recalls, when the quartet got together in the Hollis neighborhood of Queens in New York to start the label in 1992, “our mindset was we had to make as much money as we can because we don’t know how long this thing is going to last.”<br />Yet last it has. Fubu (an acronym for “For Us, By Us”) is nearing its 30th year in business, remarkable longevity that’s comparable to that of powerhouse brands like  Nike  and Ralph Lauren. The founders admit that Fubu’s public profile has faded in the past decade or so. At its peak, around 1999 to 2002, the company was grossing $350 million a year according to its founders. “We were on such a grand scale in the ’90s and early 2000s that anything less than that, I guess, to our audience felt like we went away,” said Mr. Brown during a recent Zoom interview conducted with all four founders.<br />Over the last few years, the brand has been orchestrating a relaunch the founders hope will appeal to the generation of ’90s babies born after Fubu debuted. The plan has included collaborations with Puma and  Urban Outfitters ,  as well reissues of the sort of baggy logoed gear that was inescapable on MTV and in the pages of XXL magazine through the ‘90s and early 2000s. Most recently, Fubu has relaunched its affordable suiting line in partnership with Karako, a Manhattan tailoring label, and added new licensees in Europe and South Africa.<br />Some Gen-Z style icons have embraced the revitalized Fubu. In January singer Lil Nas X posted a photo on his Instagram of himself wearing a $129 camo Fubu hoodie, while that same month NBAer Kyle Kuzma arrived at a game in a full Fubu corduroy sweatsuit.<br />As the founders tell it, hard-earned lessons from their three decades in business are culminating in this brand refresh. Early on, the foursome was preternaturally skilled at grassroots marketing. Long before social media and influencers who post #sponsored-content, Fubu was seeding free products to everyone from reverends to rappers, expanding its footprint through grassroots outreach. With very low overhead, Fubu managed to get valuable press from musicians in particular. During the heyday of MTV and BET, you could see Fubu clothes in videos for acts like Brand Nubian, Mariah Carey and O.D.B.</td>

      <td>The latest grounding of  Boeing  planes isn’t the start of another 737 MAX debacle. But it is more unwelcome publicity for an already battered U.S. aerospace industry.<br />On Sunday, airlines around the world followed Boeing’s recommendation and stopped flying all 777 jets with engines manufactured by Pratt & Whitney, a division of U.S. conglomerate Raytheon. This followed problems on a United Airlines flight Saturday that scattered engine debris over a Denver suburb. The Federal Aviation Administration will order inspections of all the affected aircraft, given the precedent of a similar incident in 2018.<br />While the extent of the problem is still unclear, it is likely to affect only a subset of a small subset of the global fleet.<br />Pratt is one of three companies to have made turbofan engines for the jet since it started flying in 1994. According to data provider Cirium, only 8.3% of all 777s in operation use the PW4000 engines in question, with another 12% sporting  Rolls-Royce  equivalents. The rest are serviced by  General Electric ,  which has been the exclusive supplier of all the longer-range 777 variants that Boeing has produced since the mid-2000s.<br />United is the top user of Pratt-powered 777s—and the only one in the U.S.—followed by Japanese carriers ANA and  Japan Airlines ,  as well as  Korean Air  and  Asiana Airlines .  Yet the immediate logistical challenges for airlines may be limited. The affected 777s are the kind of big, old jets that airlines have kept in storage during the Covid-19 crisis. Out of 127 in operation, according to Cirium, 67 were already parked.</td>

      <td>Intelligence and law-enforcement agencies may be on shaky legal ground in purchasing the data, report says</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A new Treasury Department watchdog report warns that law-enforcement agencies may not be on firm legal footing when they use cellphone GPS data drawn from mobile apps without obtaining a warrant first.<br />In a review of the Internal Revenue Service’s use of a commercial platform that allowed the agency to track cellphones, the Treasury Department inspector general for tax administration said that a landmark 2018 Supreme Court case might preclude the warrantless tracking of criminal suspects through location data generated by weather, game and other apps. The report encouraged stricter controls on use of the data.<br />Many government lawyers have concluded that the decision in Carpenter v. United States doesn’t apply because it addresses data held by cellphone carriers that contain a subscriber’s personally identifying information, rather than GPS location data drawn from apps, which doesn’t.<br />The watchdog’s report is only a recommendation, and its interpretation of the law hasn’t been blessed by any court. Yet it is the first known government analysis to raise serious doubt about the legality of law-enforcement and intelligence agencies purchasing highly revealing information generated by U.S. cellphones and other digital services.<br />The audit, requested by Sens. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) and Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), examined the IRS Criminal Investigation division’s use of a commercial software platform provided by Venntel, a company that sells to the government access to GPS data gathered from apps. Venntel’s parent company, Gravy Analytics, caters to corporate clients. The IRS experimented with Venntel’s platform as an investigative tool in 2017 and 2018 but stopped using the software.</td>

The small-scale plant in Fremont, Calif., will make batteries for smaller devices such as radios and smartwatches. Enovix is scouting a location for a second factory that will also build batteries for smartphones, and aims to start selling batteries for electric vehicles after 2025.<br />A longer-lasting, quicker-charging and cheaper battery is essential for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, improved solar-energy storage and advancements in key technologies such as augmented and virtual reality. Enovix has plenty of company:  QuantumScape Corp. , which builds solid-state batteries—a design that is free of liquid, greatly reducing fire hazards—went public last year through a SPAC deal and has a market capitalization of more than $22 billion, though it projects no meaningful revenue before 2026. China-backed Microvast Inc., which builds batteries for electric buses and other commercial vehicles, said this month it would go public through a New York-based SPAC in a deal valued at about $3 billion.<br />A SPAC deal was “the opportunity of the day,” said Enovix Chief Executive Harrold Rust. “But we have got to build the company and hit our numbers, and if we do that I think we will be a valuable company regardless of what the stock market does.”</td>

      <td>Firm transfers part of Hong Kong operations to Singapore office to reduce exposure to potential Chinese scrutiny, sources say</td>
      <td>Two co-founders of China’s Boyu Capital, a leading private-equity firm set up by a grandson of former Chinese President Jiang Zemin, have relocated to Singapore with a share of the company’s operations from its Hong Kong headquarters, according to people briefed on the move.<br />Boyu’s tilt toward the Southeast Asian city-state of Singapore was mainly driven by concerns over the ebbing clout of the elder Mr. Jiang, 94 years old, whose patronage has buttressed the firm’s success, the people said.<br />The transition, which began in late 2019, has coincided with Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s efforts to curb the influence of retired Communist Party elders and tighten Beijing’s control over the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.<br />Compared with Hong Kong, Singapore offers Boyu greater distance from potential scrutiny or adverse action by authorities in Beijing, these people said. Boyu’s Singapore office, its first presence outside China, provides a potential refuge from political intrigue within the party, they said, and helps the firm diversify from its base in Hong Kong, where business confidence has been shaken by unrest and Beijing’s efforts to stamp out dissent.<br />Launched a decade ago by Alvin Jiang—the former leader’s grandson—and three co-founders, Boyu has won a reputation for being a well-connected and savvy China-focused investor, whose backers have included Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and Singaporean state investor Temasek Holdings.</td>

Joe Manchin of West Virginia said he would oppose Ms. Tanden, citing her past statements and tweets criticizing Republicans.<br />Democrats control a narrow majority in the 50-50 Senate because Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie. But Ms. Tanden’s nomination wouldn’t have enough support to move forward if Mr. Manchin joins all Republicans in voting against her.

In January, 5,707 children arrived at the border alone, up from 4,855 the month before.<br />The numbers are smaller than in 2018 and 2019, when waves of children and families overwhelmed border-patrol stations and migrant shelters.<br />But this time, government capacity is limited: The child-shelter network run by the Department of Health and Human Services to house migrant children has reduced its capacity by 40%, and as of Friday, shelters were 93% full.<br />“They’ve seen very large growth in a very short period of time,” said Mark Greenberg, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan Washington think tank, who oversaw the shelter network during the Obama administration. “The closer you get to 100% capacity, the harder the system is to manage.”</td>

      <td>The highly transmissible Covid-19 virus variant that first emerged in the U.K. can partially evade a commonly used coronavirus test. Some health authorities are using that fact to their advantage.<br />As more-transmissible variants emerge as a concern in the fight against the virus, the vast majority of Covid-19 diagnostic tests haven’t been affected. But for a handful, including one from diagnostics giant  Thermo Fisher Scientific  Inc.,  a section of the test can’t pick up on variants including the U.K. variant that have a specific mutation, the company, laboratories and health officials who have processed its tests said.<br />Yet the other parts of the tests still work. So if a test comes up positive for Covid-19 but that portion of the test fails, that could indicate that the samples contain the U.K. variant. Some laboratories are exploiting the bug to more quickly find cases that might be caused by the fast-spreading variant.<br />“It’s actually been a benefit for public health to be able to monitor,” Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said at an online event last week. “There was a silver lining there.”<br />The tests in question are PCR tests: molecular tests that search for specific portions of the virus’s genetic code and amplify them. They are often performed in a lab. The large majority of Covid-19 diagnostic tests, including both molecular and rapid-antigen tests, are able to flag known Covid-19 virus variants as a positive test result.</td>

The president and his advisers have for weeks been quietly discussing the matter with members of Congress and senior Capitol Hill aides, according to people familiar with the matter, and Mr. Biden is optimistic that a compromise can be reached.<br />The exact contours of the new round of investments in the economy remain to be determined. Mr. Biden during his presidential campaign outlined his interest in new infrastructure investments and measures to combat climate change and boost manufacturing jobs, as well as improving access to child care and seeking ways to increase racial equity.<br />The prospect of another pricey package is already raising concerns among some Republicans. Congressional aides also said that while there is bipartisan interest in funding infrastructure improvements, there will be tension between progressive lawmakers who want expansive proposals that address longstanding Democratic priorities and moderates and Republicans who support less expensive, more tailored measures.</td>

      <td>Macquarie earned a windfall when the deep freeze in Texas sent energy markets into a tailspin</td>
      <td>The deep freeze that plunged millions of Texans into darkness last week produced a windfall of up to $215 million for  Macquarie Group Ltd. , an Australian investment bank that is active in U.S. power and gas markets.<br />The extreme weather froze wind turbines and oil-and-gas wells, closed oil refiners and prompted power stations to trip offline, sending a jolt through energy markets. Wholesale power prices rocketed, as did spot prices for natural gas in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Arkansas.<br />The turbulence led to a bonanza for Macquarie’s commodity traders, who specialize in sending gas and electricity to clients such as utility companies in unusual situations.<br />The bank bumped up its guidance Monday for earnings in the year through March to reflect the windfall. It said that net profit after tax would be 5% to 10% higher than in the 2020 fiscal year. That equates to an increase of up to 273.1 million Australian dollars, equivalent to around $215 million. In its previous guidance, issued Feb. 9, Macquarie said it expected profits to be slightly down on 2020.<br />“Extreme winter weather conditions in North America have significantly increased short-term client demand for Macquarie’s capabilities in maintaining critical physical supply across the commodity complex, and particularly in relation to gas and power,” the bank said.</td>

      <td>In a world changed by the pandemic, the hotel chain’s key to recovery may be mixing business with pleasure</td>
      <td>Marriott International ’s  late Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson, who died last week, told Forbes in 2019 that he wanted his company to be “as big as possible.” His boldest move came back in 2015 when he announced that Marriott would acquire Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, adding brands that appealed to travelers’ interests and values such as design, fashion, youth and productivity. Now Marriott is hoping Mr. Sorenson’s biggest deal can be its savior.<br />If big was Mr. Sorenson’s mission, he succeeded. Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood made it the largest hotel chain in the world. Over the course of Mr. Sorenson’s decade-plus tenure at the top, Marriott’s stock more than tripled, keeping most of his long-term shareholders happy.<br />Until last year, at least, when some of its portfolio’s strengths became its biggest weaknesses. Nearly half of Marriott’s hotel rooms are now in urban areas, while upscale rooms make up about a third of its portfolio. In 2019, 60% of its room nights booked were for business travel. In 2020, the coronavirus hit urban and upscale hotels the hardest in the hotel industry, according to data from hotel-analytics firm STR. Perhaps worst of all, business travel essentially evaporated overnight. At the height of the pandemic in April, Marriott temporarily had to shut more than a quarter of its hotels, while revenue per available room was down 90% year on year.<br />But at least some of Marriott’s die hard investors seem relatively undeterred, even while trends remain severely depressed. On Thursday, Marriott said it swung to its first full-year loss since 2009. It also said occupancy rates in the U.S. and Canada fell from the third to the fourth quarter to just 35%, less than half of the world-wide occupancy levels the company saw in 2019 overall. Meanwhile, the company declined to give a substantive 2021 outlook, except to say that the impact of Covid-19 would continue to be material to its results.<br />Marriott’s stock is up 44% over the past six months and is nearly back to pre-pandemic levels, signaling investors’ faith that its business will fully rebound, and quickly. There are certainly signs this could be the case: Marriott said occupancy rates in mainland China, where the virus has eased, reached 60% in July and remained above that level for the remainder of the year. However, the company also reported high volatility around renewed increases in the virus, noting occupancy in the country has fallen to 40% year-to-date for that reason. That volatility is certainly something investors should keep in mind as they bet on Marriott’s recovery: Analysts aren’t forecasting that Marriott’s revenue will recover to anywhere close to 2019 levels this year.</td>

      <td>Short-term imbalances between supply and demand may justify a 10-year high for copper prices, but staying there would prove more challenging</td>
      <td>Copper prices jumped to just above $9,000 a metric ton in New York in early trading Monday, leaving the metal up 14% this year at its highest level in almost a decade. But wide-eyed talk of a new commodity supercycle is premature.<br />Supercycles are long-running, broad-based commodity bull markets like the one from the late 1990s until the early 2010s. Copper rebounded rapidly after the 2008 crash and didn’t peak until early 2011. But it’s unlikely the favorable conditions that held then will be replicated—particularly in China.<br />During that post-financial-crisis surge in copper prices, China began perhaps the most rapacious expansion of construction in its history: The amount of real estate floor space on which construction began rose by more than 40% in 2010. In 2011, real estate starts were more than twice what they were in 2007.<br />There is little prospect of a repeat performance now. China’s recovery owes more to its near-eradication of Covid-19 for most of 2020 than the sort of no-holds-barred stimulus seen in the U.S. and other developed economies. Indeed, Chinese M2 money supply rose slower than that of the U.S., eurozone, U.K. or Japan last year. The government is concerned with the leverage of major real-estate companies, and households in general, and won’t permit another debt-driven surge in building. Nor is there likely to be a boom in infrastructure investment above what was expected before the pandemic.<br />There are legitimate long-term bullish factors for some commodities, including copper. The metal is needed for electric and hybrid vehicles. But that doesn’t explain why copper is up 45% from pre-pandemic levels, when those long-term applications already were well-known—nor why it is rallying with oil, which certainly won’t benefit from a more decarbonized future.</td>

      <td>How a company uses carbon emission offsets can help identify risky businesses</td>
      <td>Investors need to dig into the details of net-zero emission plans to assess their value and risks. Thankfully there is a handy shortcut.<br />Companies face rising costs of carbon dioxide emissions. European Union credit costs reached a record high of nearly €40 a metric ton, or about $48, this month. Levies of over $100 are expected in many countries by 2030. Given the very limited information available about companies’ carbon footprints and cleanup plans, analyzing how they use CO2 reduction techniques can be a helpful shortcut to identify risky businesses.<br />All industries will be affected, and heavily polluting ones face significant financial risk. Oil and coal producers face existential questions. The challenge is also particularly acute in so-called hard-to-abate industries: airlines, cement, long-haul trucking, plastics, shipping and steel. Many investors would like to distinguish the leaders from the laggards.<br />A commitment to cut emissions is a good start. Nearly 1,400 companies have promised to reduce their net CO2 emissions to zero by 2050, according to the UN’s Race to Zero campaign. However, patchy disclosure of carbon footprints and uncertainty about how markets will evolve over the decades mean investors can struggle to understand a company’s plans and associated risks. Reporting standards will help, once agreed.<br />Meanwhile, one useful indicator is how much a plan relies on carbon reduction techniques or offsets such as planting trees or carbon capture projects. Offsets are widely used, but even some companies in the hard-to-abate sectors, such as global shipping giant Maersk and steel producer  Thyssenkrupp ,  plan to decarbonize without them.</td>

The brand, one of the youngest in the famed sparkling wine region, is known for its metallic bottles that cost hundreds of dollars each.<br />The investment, LVMH and Jay-Z said, is aimed at growing Armand de Brignac through LVMH’s global distribution networks while drawing upon the conglomerate’s vast resources within Champagne wine country. It comes at a difficult moment for Champagne: The pandemic canceled weddings, soirees and other occasions to pop corks, cutting sales of the wine by around 20% last year. The two sides didn’t disclose the value of the transaction.<br />“We were working really hard to maintain a brand that was growing faster than the staff we had and bigger than some of the expertise we had,” Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, said in an interview. “We’d been in this 15 years, not a hundred.”<br />The partnership shows how European luxury brands are now embracing Black recording artists and hip-hop culture to appeal to a younger, more diverse clientele. Rihanna and LVMH launched a cosmetics line, Fenty Beauty. The rapper Gucci Mane and his namesake brand, the Italian fashion house Gucci, have collaborated on a collection. Dior, an LVMH brand, has used the rapper A$AP Rocky as a featured model in several menswear collections. Streetwear has become a staple of luxury fashion.</td>

Now  SoftBank  is hoping for a repeat in South Korea.<br />Coupang, a fast-growing Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010, filed this month for an initial public offering in New York that could come as early as March. It is expected to value Coupang at more than $50 billion, the most for a foreign company since Alibaba in 2014—creating another windfall for SoftBank’s Vision Fund. The Japanese company is a 38% owner, a stake it acquired by investing a total of just $2.7 billion since 2015.<br />Coupang has quickly become Korea’s largest e-commerce player, according to Euromonitor International—booking $12 billion in revenue last year, its IPO prospectus says, compared with $2.4 billion in 2017. While still unprofitable, the company narrowed its losses by about a third last year. Coupang has spent heavily building its own delivery network and fulfillment centers, helping it entice customers with next-day delivery and easy returns.<br />As in other countries, e-commerce grew strongly in Korea during the pandemic. But online shopping has long been popular there, and will account for 28.9% of retail sales in 2021, market researcher eMarketer forecasts—second only to China. Korea’s population density helps: About half of the country’s 52 million people live in Greater Seoul, making it easier for Coupang to achieve the fast delivery it promises.<br />Coupang has unseated  eBay  as the market leader, but the sector remains fragmented. One of the strongest competitors is local giant Naver, whose leading position in search and payments has helped it push into online shopping too. Its e-commerce revenue last year was up 38% from 2019, and it has partners in  CJ Logistics ,  one of Korea’s largest logistics companies, and  BGF Retail ,  which runs its largest convenience-store chain.</td>

      <td>Protesters use live-streaming, messaging apps and social media to exchange plans and alert one another of danger</td>
      <td>Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets across Myanmar in response to calls by activists for a general strike, mounting what appeared to be one of the largest demonstrations against this month’s coup and signaling to the country’s military that resistance to its takeover isn’t likely to abate.<br />Protesters have rallied every day for more than two weeks. The Feb. 1 coup abruptly ended Myanmar’s decadelong democratic shift and returned the country to military rule, with the hugely popular civilian politician Aung San Suu Kyi detained in her house and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces in absolute control. Hundreds of others have since been detained, including politicians and activists, and nights bring internet blackouts and the fear of police raids and other attacks.<br />Monday’s massive turnout, accompanied by the closure of many shops and other places of work, comes after police fired on protesters on Saturday, killing two people. More than 30 others were injured in the incident, which took place in the city of Mandalay. A message on state-run TV late Sunday warned that protesters were pushing people down a path of confrontation where they would suffer a loss of life.<br />The demonstrations don’t have a leader, but participants have mobilized crowds using phone calls, texts, live-streaming, messaging apps like Signal and social-media websites to exchange plans and alert fellow protesters.<br />Arising at 5 a.m. Monday, Thaw Zin drove around Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, to map out the locations of police barricades, street closures and convoys of military vehicles—details he shared with a core group of friends, whom he calls “proliferators of information,” who in turn relayed the tidbits to others to help plan the day’s demonstrations. An hour later, he was at a prominent protest site, hanging up posters from an overpass before police arrived.</td>

      <td>Starting in 2022, internet-lending platforms will have to fund at least 30% of every loan they make jointly with commercial lenders</td>
      <td>China’s banking regulator formalized rules that will force Ant Group Co. and other online lenders to have more skin in the game when they make loans with banks, dealing a blow to a burgeoning business that helped drive Chinese consumer spending in recent years.<br />Starting in 2022, internet-lending platforms in the country will have to fund at least 30% of every loan they make jointly with commercial lenders, which include banks, trust companies, and finance companies. Individual banks will also be subject to new caps on how much they can lend together with online partners, according to regulations published on Saturday by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.<br />Several analysts on Monday said the rules are aimed at large technology companies including Ant and WeBank, a large online lender backed by  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  Both have become big originators of unsecured loans to individuals and small businesses by working with dozens of commercial lenders that supply most of the funds. Ant and WeBank declined to comment.<br />Ant, in particular, has come under intense regulatory scrutiny since its blockbuster initial public offerings were pulled in early November last year. The owner of Alipay, which has more than a billion users in China, has partnered with around 100 commercial lenders, including many small regional banks and trust companies, to make loans to hundreds of millions of individuals, raking in large profits in the process.<br />At the end of June 2020, Ant had the equivalent of $267 billion in outstanding consumer loans, accounting for nearly a fifth of the country’s outstanding short-term household debt. Just 2% of that total was funded by the Hangzhou-based company. Its consumer-lending services, Huabei and Jiebei, have supplied credit to many free-spending young people in China who don’t qualify for bank-issued credit cards.</td>

Its sweeping purchases have helped reduce borrowing costs for governments and companies across the region.<br />In the first two weeks of February, the ECB bought bonds issued by subsidiaries of London-based companies such as oil major  BP  PLC, consumer retail giant Unilever PLC and beer and spirits maker  Diageo  PLC, the central bank’s weekly filings show. It doesn’t disclose how much it spent on the bonds.<br />Both the Bank of England and the ECB are buying corporate bonds to keep credit markets functioning smoothly after the coronavirus pandemic dealt a blow to the global economy. But the BOE buys a far smaller volume of bonds, and imposes more rigorous eligibility requirements.<br />Rates are also lower in Europe. The yield on investment-grade corporate bonds in Europe was at 0.3% on Friday, compared with 1.7% in the U.K., according to  ICE  indexes.</td>

They sent workers home, and brought them back again. They held emergency meeting after emergency meeting. They shared their own homes and lives with staff in video calls and personal words. They tried to save the world, through vaccines and bleach wipes or even just getting folks enough toilet paper.<br />This was leading a company in 2020, through the worst crisis most bosses have witnessed in their careers. Working through it was often painful, but there are things we can learn from all of it—the actions of upstarts and veterans, the missteps and failures, and the groundbreaking wins.<br />The Wall Street Journal’s Leadership Lessons From the Covid-19 Crisis, available to download for Journal subscribers, spotlights how leaders adapted to a challenge unprecedented in our modern times, including takeaways from their experiences.<br />The tactics on display include both old-school styles harking back to the days of Jack Welch (see  Emerson Electric ’s  David Farr), and more modern approaches. I’m all for the new wave of empathetic leadership that we’ve seen some executives move toward recently, but these case studies suggest there are circumstances that call for nonstop hours, tough feedback and seemingly impossible goals, as was the case at  Moderna ,  which developed a Covid-19 vaccine. Keep it fair, of course, but when the whole world is watching, and the outcome is literally a matter of life and death, sometimes you need a hard-charging leader pushing you forward.</td>

In 2016, Senate Republicans refused to grant him one after President Barack Obama nominated him for the Supreme Court. Republicans and Democrats alike are hailing the nominee, who spearheaded domestic terrorism investigations for the Justice Department in the 1990s, as expertly qualified both to fight the threat of extremist violence and to restore morale, stability and institutional integrity to a Justice Department roiled by political storms in recent years.<br />The federal judge and former prosecutor will highlight critical tasks that he would take on if confirmed, including overseeing the prosecution of “white supremacists and others” involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to prepared remarks released over the weekend.<br />Judge Garland would also pursue strong enforcement of civil-rights law, citing the Justice Department’s original mission to enforce amendments that provided broader rights and protections for Black Americans that grew out of the Civil War.<br />“That mission remains urgent because we do not yet have equal justice,” he plans to say. “Communities of color and other minorities still face discrimination in housing, education, employment, and the criminal justice system; and bear the brunt of the harm caused by pandemic, pollution, and climate change.”</td>

That is the largest such gap between the two indexes through Feb. 19 since 2000, according to Dow Jones Market Data.<br />The leadership by small companies goes back even further. Over the past six months, they are beating the S&P 500 by nearly 30 percentage points as investors anticipate greater fiscal spending from the Biden administration.<br />Among some of the biggest gainers: hydrogen fuel-cell company  Plug Power Inc.,  fast-food chain  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc.  and retailer  Macy’s Inc.  All three stocks have more than doubled in the past six months and are up at least 30% in 2021.<br />Smaller companies are more tied to the domestic economy than their large-cap counterparts, which make more money overseas. Economically sensitive sectors such as energy, materials and banking also account for more of the Russell 2000 than larger indexes. These cyclical groups were battered by the pandemic but are now powering markets to records.</td>

These seats would be given to some of the more than 200 Hong Kong-resident members of China’s top political advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the people said.<br />The plan is part of sweeping changes presaged by the chief of Beijing’s office on Hong Kong affairs, Xia Baolong, in a speech on Monday in which he said that Hong Kong’s executive, legislature and judiciary must comprise “true patriots.” In his first public speech after taking the office in early 2020, Mr. Xia called anyone who opposes the governments of China or Hong Kong “destroyers” who shouldn’t be able to exert influence in the future.<br />Mr. Xia didn’t specify any proposed electoral changes, but the people familiar with the plans said details of the legislation are being completed ahead of the March 5 opening of the National People’s Congress, China’s legislature. Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who has a low public-approval rating, hasn’t said whether she intends to run for a second five-year term next year.</td>

Declining bond prices result in rising yields, which have stoked concern that highflying stocks are starting to look less attractive than assets considered to be risk free.<br />“As the yield goes up, there is more demand for [government bonds] in relation to other assets,” said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. “How much are you willing to pay for stocks?

Mr. Ryu’s defection in 2019 occurred just two months after Pyongyang’s acting ambassador to Rome, Jo Song Gil, defected to Seoul.<br />The number of recent ambassador-level defections from North Korea shows Kim Jong Un’s control over the regime’s bureaucracy may not be as strong as his father’s or grandfather’s, said Cheon Seong-whun, a former South Korean national security official. However, he cautioned against reading too much into the defections as a sign of the regime’s fragility.<br />“We should be wary of interpreting the series of defections as a sign of weakness of the Kim Jong Un regime,” Mr. Cheon said. Most North Koreans have a tendency to rally around their leader against outside pressure, he said.</td>

      <td>Having a sense of humor can defuse tension and build camaraderie among co-workers. But when jokes go too far, they can alienate, anger and offend your colleagues.</td>
      <td>Should you be funny at work?<br />Nail it, and humor can bond teams, boost your career and make even the most boring and stressful jobs bearable. Miss, and you can face awkward silence on Zoom, offended colleagues—or even worse, public ridicule on social media.<br />“Best-case scenario, they promise never to go on  Twitter  again,” management professor Brad Bitterly says of those who broadcast bad jokes out to the world. “Worst-case scenario, they also lose their job and are publicly shamed.”<br />OK, so that’s not great. Plus, if comedy is tragedy plus time, what are we supposed to do amid a deeply unfunny public health crisis and exceedingly serious national conversation around politics and race? At a moment when so many of us could use a laugh, we’re all terrified of stumbling.<br />Mercifully, it’s not that hard to get right, those who study humor told me.</td>

      <td>Relations sour at a critical negotiating period for the state’s budget</td>
      <td>The relationship between New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and leading lawmakers of his own party has hit a nadir amid questions over the Democratic governor’s handling of Covid-19 in nursing homes.<br />Democrats who control the state Senate plan to pass a bill this week requiring additional approval of any future executive orders, which Mr. Cuomo has been issuing to manage the pandemic, according to a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat from Yonkers. Republican lawmakers are talking about impeachment, but Democrats dismissed their effort as disingenuous.<br />On Thursday, lawmakers from both parties said they would publicly grill State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker over the state’s delay in releasing a fuller tally of nursing-home deaths as well as a controversial March 25 department directive that said nursing homes couldn’t refuse to admit Covid-positive patients.<br />Mr. Cuomo and his aides have responded forcefully to critical lawmakers both recently and over the course of his time in office, and the governor said on Friday that he would be more aggressive in addressing critics of his actions on nursing homes. Dr. Zucker said the March 25 directive was consistent with federal guidance at the time and was necessary to preserve hospital capacity.<br />But pressure tactics that normally happen in private are bursting into public view and, some legislators said, have only steeled their positions.</td>

      <td>His administration appears to have engaged in a coverup to frustrate federal oversight.</td>
      <td>The Cuomo administration’s alleged misreporting of nursing-home deaths in New York is serious, perhaps meriting federal criminal charges.<br />On March 25, 2020, Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order requiring New York nursing homes to admit hospitalized patients who had tested positive for Covid-19. The order also prohibited nursing homes from requiring hospitalized residents deemed “medically stable” to be tested before admission or readmission. By the end of the summer New York had more than 32,000 Covid deaths, the highest in the nation and more than double any other state. If New York were its own country, it would have ranked among the top 10 for Covid deaths. The number of deaths translated to the country’s second-highest death rate—more than three times the national average.<br />What caught the Justice Department’s eye was Gov. Cuomo’s claim that New York’s nursing-home deaths were lower than many other states’ and that his March 25 order didn’t contribute to the extremely high number of New Yorkers who died from Covid. Given the virus’s disproportionate effect on the elderly, sick and frail, this seemed unlikely. On Aug. 26, Justice’s Civil Rights Division, relying on its jurisdiction to investigate government-run facilities under the federal Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, asked the Cuomo administration for data on New York’s publicly run nursing homes, which account for less than 5% of nursing homes in the state.<br />In September, New York produced data showing it had underreported Covid deaths in government-run nursing homes by a third. The undercounting appeared to be due to several factors. First, when a nursing-home resident who contracted Covid died after being transported to a hospital for treatment, New York didn’t count it as a “nursing-home death.” Second, New York didn’t include deaths occurring before the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began requiring Covid reporting from nursing homes in mid-May. CMS made reporting prior Covid deaths optional, and New York apparently elected to keep the information to itself.<br />But New York officials knew the data they reported to CMS only went back to mid-May. The Cuomo administration misled the public when it relied on that data to claim in late September that the state’s total nursing-home deaths were low.</td>

      <td>Speculative manias are in the air, as evidenced by the recent price surges for bitcoin, a digital asset with a fundamental value of zero, and  GameStop ,  a declining retailer. Along with the other economic trends—a strong recovery, surging commodity prices and an uptick in inflation—those asset bubbles have a clear cause: the massive expansion of money and credit.<br />Yet America’s fiscal and monetary masters are turning a blind eye. They are focused solely on mending the labor market. With the fervor of messiahs, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen tell us the only way to save the labor market and reach full employment is to continue to pour fiscal and monetary fuel on the fire. But their prescriptions and prophecies, modeled on the playbook of the 2008 financial crisis, are not valid today.<br />After that crisis, the Fed began quantitative easing, which massively expanded its balance sheet. At the same time, commercial banks were busy shrinking their loan books and writing off losses from mortgage debt and securities, which meant the Fed’s injections did little more than offset the contraction of commercial bank balance sheets. As a result, money growth from 2010-19, as measured by the Fed’s broadest money measure, M2, averaged only 5.8% a year.<br />While money on the Fed’s books grew rapidly, money in the hands of the public grew slowly. Spending and inflation were restrained, and the postcrisis recovery was anemic with inflation persistently below the Fed’s target. In contrast, China’s money-supply growth exploded in 2009 and 2010, averaging 23% a year. China achieved a strong recovery as a result, but also a jump in inflation, which moved from minus 1.8% in July 2009 to 6.5% by July 2011. Money matters.<br />Fast-forward to February 2020. Since then, the quantity of money in the U.S. economy, measured by M2, has increased by an astonishing $4 trillion. That’s a one-year increase of 26%—the largest annual percentage increase since 1943.</td>

      <td>Companies won’t make permanent investments in new employees based on temporary revenue.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration says if Congress passes the proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill, we won’t have to “wait for years for the economy to return to full employment,” as two members of the Council of Economic Advisers put it in a recent White House blog post.<br />It’s the right goal. In April 2017, the unemployment rate dipped below what the Congressional Budget Office projected as full employment. It stayed there until the pandemic. That created intense competition for employees and drove wage growth at or above 3% for 20 consecutive pre-pandemic months. By 2019 median family income hit a record high, the poverty rate declined to a record low, and income inequality decreased for the second year in a row.<br />The jobs picture is all but certain to improve in a year when people are getting vaccinated and states are opening their economies. The labor market will improve in the coming months if the government does nothing. But massive spending will hurt more than it helps.<br />Business owners recognize that government spending can put more money into circulation and may result in increased sales. But they also know that government largess—no matter how generous—is finite. If you believe a revenue source is going to dry up, you don’t invest in growth and hiring based on its continuing.<br />Say you owned a restaurant and sales increased because your competitor next door burned down, but he had insurance and would rebuild. You’d certainly appreciate the increased sales, but you wouldn’t hire more permanent employees, because you know the increased revenue is temporary.</td>

      <td>Gov. Greg Abbott inadvertently gives Mexico protectionist arguments in energy.</td>
      <td>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s decision last week to ban natural-gas exports to Mexico temporarily was shortsighted and counterproductive for his state.<br />This isn’t to dismiss the suffering in Texas. But Northern Mexico, which was also in the deep freeze, is the Lone Star State’s largest trading partner and its biggest market for natural-gas exports. Trying to use a state edict to cut off Mexican power generators in a crisis was a public admission that in Texas’s eyes, customers south of the border don’t rate.<br />As the cold snap ends, gas exports will resume and life will go on as before for Texas gas suppliers. But Mr. Abbott has handed Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador a cudgel with which to beat Mexico’s economic liberals, who opened energy markets to private investment and trade in 2014. It is their fault, AMLO argues, that Mr. Abbott has the power to leave them shivering in the dark.<br />This claim is nowhere near the truth—I’ll get to that in a minute—but AMLO used it last week to launch a new blitzkrieg against energy competition, foreign and domestic, in Mexico. The world-class demagogue from Tabasco, who thrives on nationalism, now has the bit in his mouth. Over time it could cost Texas gas suppliers.<br />The Abbott decree was likely not even legal. “Force majeure” clauses in contracts might allow the interruption of shipments due to an act of God. But a governor doesn’t have jurisdiction to shut down international trade unilaterally.</td>
