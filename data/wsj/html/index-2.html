      <td>WASHINGTON—A Republican senator said he would object to the results of the presidential election when Congress holds a joint session next week to certify Democrat Joe Biden as the winner, a move that would force lawmakers to vote to affirm the states’ tallies but has no chance of overturning the outcome.<br />“Millions of voters concerned about election integrity deserve to be heard,” tweeted Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. “I will object on January 6 on their behalf.”<br />President Trump has blamed voter fraud for his defeat in the November election, but no significant evidence emerged that would challenge the result. Recently departed Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department hadn’t found evidence of widespread voter fraud that could reverse Mr. Biden’s election victory.<br />The Trump campaign has continued to try to challenge the results in court, and on Tuesday it asked the Supreme Court to overturn Mr. Biden’s victory in Wisconsin.<br />Federal law requires Congress to count and certify the results of each state’s electoral vote in a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, but lawmakers can raise objections. It takes one member of the House and one senator to formally object and force debate and votes in both chambers.</td>

      <td>Theaters have faced a rough year with the coronavirus pandemic, but the financial upsides they offer filmmakers should help secure their future.</td>
      <td><br /><br />Since Netflix released its first film, “Beasts of No Nation,” five years ago, the rise of streaming services has transformed the distribution of feature films to audiences around the globe. In 2020, Covid-19 took a sledgehammer to the theatrical market, and chaos ensued. With Warner Bros. breaking a longstanding precedent, thanks to its recent decision to release its entire 2021 slate simultaneously in movie theaters and on HBO Max, the fate of the theatrical business is under assault. But those who predict the early demise of the theatrical release may be proved wrong.<br />First the good news. During the pandemic, the demand for quality content has remained incredibly high. Disney+ reached 70 million subscribers far more quickly than anticipated as people want to find great entertainment options. With streamers offering low-cost subscriptions, millions of additional people can access world-class content at an affordable price. This has helped revitalize several subgenres that were waning theatrically, among them the romantic comedy (see 2019’s “Always Be My Maybe”) and the live-action family film (such as “The Christmas Chronicles” franchise).<br />It is also hard to imagine certain hits, like “The Queen’s Gambit,” a captivating but niche period drama miniseries about chess, being as successful in a nonstreaming world. In addition, streaming allows audiences to encounter movies that were otherwise largely overlooked in their initial theatrical release. The critically acclaimed “First Cow” had a small footprint at the cinema but has now found a far larger audience thanks to online distribution.</td>

      <td>Tiffany  & Co. executives will be happy that the final hurdle to the jeweler’s bumpy union with  LVMH  Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has been removed. The French buyer might be more preoccupied with how to make the pricey deal pay off.<br />On Wednesday, Tiffany’s shareholders gave their approval for a slight discount to the original merger terms. The jeweler now has a sticker price of $15.8 billion, down from $16.2 billion. It is still a good result for investors who at one stage feared the deal could collapse. They cash out at a 33% premium to the value of the shares before news of talks between the two sides first leaked in October of 2019, even though the pandemic has shrunk the brand’s revenue.<br />After the deal closes in early January, five top executives at Tiffany will receive golden parachutes worth $100 million in total, and LVMH will begin an overhaul.<br />Jewelry has performed better than other luxury products during the pandemic. Global sales will be down 15% in 2020 compared with last year’s levels based on Bain & Company estimates. By comparison, high-end watches and clothing will decline at double that rate.<br />Tiffany might still underperform the global jewelry market, though. The company’s sales were down by one-quarter over the nine months through October. It relies on tourists for a chunk of sales, particularly at its Fifth Avenue flagship in New York, and its engagement-ring business is suffering as couples delay marriage.</td>

That is, research not motivated by practical applications and not conducted by private companies, but motivated by the simple goal of understanding how the natural world works and conducted largely in public institutions.<br />Second is the essential role of governments and public funding, not only to support the basic research, but also to provide the legal framework essential for a market economy. I don’t deny the crucial role of private enterprise from that point onward, but to conclude that pharmaceutical companies and Operation Warp Speed deserve the vast bulk of the credit for the development of the vaccines is a selective reading of how science works.<br />William Horns<br />Fitchburg, Wis.<br /></td>

It is so important, in our world threatened by critical theory and cancel culture, to understand where we came from and the importance of freedom and individual responsibility in delivering us from the “darkness” and “oppression.” Your courage in sharing Paul’s words to the Galatians is one reason that I’ve been a subscriber for more than 60 years.<br />William Beattie<br />Danbury, Conn.<br /><br />I was struck by the ocean of difference in depth between neighboring opinion articles on Christmas Eve. Royster’s “In Hoc Anno Domini” ends by appealing to the best parts of human nature: “And so Paul, the apostle of the Son of Man, spoke to his brethren, the Galatians, the words he would have us remember afterward in each of the years of his Lord: Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.”</td>

      <td>Alan Ayckbourn takes on the trio of roles in his 1994 work about a musical prodigy who died of an overdose in Stephen Joseph Theatre’s radio-play version.</td>
      <td>Alan Ayckbourn, a great playwright who masquerades as a popular entertainer, remains abundantly active at age 81. Not only does he continue to write—80 plays to date—but he acted in a radio play of his own, “Anno Domino,” that was webcast in May by Scarborough’s Stephen Joseph Theatre, the company Mr. Ayckbourn led from 1972 to 2009. Now he has given us a second radio play, “Haunting Julia,” first staged in 1994 and newly adapted and directed by the author for audio-only performance, in which he plays three parts with seemingly casual virtuosity.<br />“Haunting Julia” is a latter-day ghost story about a Mozart-like musical prodigy who died of an overdose of sleeping pills at the age of 19 and with whose suicide the play’s three characters are still obsessed 12 years later. Joe, her smothering, uncomprehending father, has turned Julia’s home into a music-center-cum-shrine that is the setting of the play. He persists in believing, all evidence to the contrary, that there was something suspicious about the stated cause of her death: “I’ve had policemen and doctors and psychiatrists all trotting out their favorite scenarios or whatever they call them, and they all amount to a load of so much boiled cabbage.”<br />Andy, Julia’s now-married boyfriend, discovered her corpse the day after she killed herself and believes that she was “completely screwed up from the day she was born by a father who never let her alone for a second….Her only refuge was her music.” Ken, the third character, is a mousy mortuary attendant who claims to have psychic powers and offers his services to the skeptical Joe. “There are things that you catch a sense of—that you know are happening…have happened…are even about to happen…and there’s nothing you can do about it,” he explains. “Not a thing.”<br />“Haunting Julia” is a ghost story in the sense that inexplicable things take place in it (none of which I will describe here). But it is, I think, better understood as a psychological drama about the devastating emotional damage wrought upon people who find it impossible to come to terms with the untimely death of a loved one. Seen from that point of view, it is singularly well suited to the moment, a tale of grief for the age of Covid-19, though there is much more to the play than that. Among other things, Mr. Ayckbourn is also inviting us to speculate on the nature of artistic talent and the way that it can distort the personalities of those who are blessed—or cursed—with it. In Julia’s words, as reported by Ken: “It’s the music….It’s—like a great cloud in front of the sun…It’s blotting out [my] life.”<br />In addition, he rings fresh changes on the underlying theme of his oeuvre, the near-insurmountable difficulty that men and women have in communicating with one another, usually because, as Ken hints, the men aren’t trying hard enough: “We’re like radio sets. But mostly we’re all switched on to transmit, you see. Even when we think we’re listening to each other, we’re not really. We’re actually busy thinking up what we’re going to say, even before the other person’s finished saying what they’re saying.” Scary things happen in “Haunting Julia,” at some of which you will likely jump in your seat, but the play’s deeper emotional resonance comes from its exploration of the male-female divide.</td>

      <td>A desperate mother of two mixes pragmatism with optimism in Phyllida Lloyd’s stirring feature.</td>
      <td>A small Irish film called “Herself,” directed by Phyllida Lloyd, has arrived just in time to take its rightful place as one of 2020’s special pleasures. (It’s playing in select theaters before going to Amazon Prime Video on Jan. 8, 2021.) But small compared to what? If measured by likely budgets, a couple of hundred films on the scale of this one could have been made for the cost of, say, “Wonder Woman 1984.” But “Herself” bulks far larger than any would-be blockbuster with a shriveled spirit if measured by depth of feeling, sheer delight and genuine surprise, even shock. And there’s a startlingly fine performance in the title role by Clare Dunne, who, with Malcolm Campbell, wrote the screenplay.<br />Ms. Dunne is Sandra, the mother of two endearing little girls and the partner of a carpenter, Gary (Ian Lloyd Anderson). His gifts for self-scrutiny and self-control are roughly equal: that is to say, this infantile brute will almost surely kill Sandra if she stays with him any longer. Domestic abuse is the trigger for what follows, but the film is too concerned with the complexities and contradictions of life to be about only one thing. Its next concern is housing—and that’s not the last one either.<br />A waitress at a pub, Sandra also finds time to clean and care for a physician, Peggy O’Toole (Harriet Walter, from “Killing Eve”), who’s back home in Dublin recovering from having broken her hip in a field hospital in Africa. But Sandra doesn’t have the money to rent or buy a safe haven for herself and her children. All three of them are stuck in a public-housing hotel room until she comes upon a promising notion in the form of a tiny house—specs and plans available for free on the internet—that can be built for £35,000, or around $47,000.<br />It’s easy to imagine the feel-good appeal of such a construction project selling an outline, treatment or elevator pitch that leads to a script being written and a film being made in which the mom manages to get the money and build the house. That corresponds roughly to what happens here, but very roughly, since, as I said, home building is only part of an uncommonly rich fabric that constitutes the film as a whole. Another way of putting it is that “Herself” has a largeness of spirit that finds room for its passionate, funny and fiercely desperate heroine and everyone who rallies around her. A couple of scenes threaten to cross the line between joy and sentimentality. For the most part, though, the film makes goodwill plausible by making evil equally so.<br />Sandra, as written and played by Ms. Dunne, is driven by terror and sustained by love for her daughters, Emma (Ruby Rose O’Hara) and Molly (Molly McCann). Depending on the moment, her thought processes are brilliantly clear or touchingly wishful. Both modes collide when she makes an earnest appeal at a welfare office. Given her dim prospects for breaking out of the poverty cycle, and the cost of the welfare hotel, the government would save huge sums, she explains, by lending her the money for the house. Her logic is impeccable and her proposal is, of course, doomed.</td>

      <td>A ‘Masterpiece’ mystery stars Glenda Jackson as an elderly woman with dementia who struggles to convince those around her about the seriousness of a friend’s disappearance.</td>
      <td>Glenda Jackson, two-time Oscar winner and former member of the British Parliament, returns to the small screen for the first time in nearly three decades in “Elizabeth Is Missing,” a mystery that puts a few poignant spins on some conventions of the genre. Has a crime actually happened? Why will no one listen? And how unreliable is our unreliable witness?<br />Having made a triumphant re-emergence on the London stage in 2016 as King Lear, Ms. Jackson brings a kindred squall of wintry ferocity to Maud Horsham, a woman with dementia who insists, to deaf ears all around, that her friend Elizabeth has disappeared. In her 80s, Maud lives alone—under the close supervision of her long-suffering daughter, Helen (Helen Behan)—and gets through her day on sticky notes: “Don’t forget to lock up”; “Coffee helps memory”; and “Today Elizabeth’s house gardening.” While digging about with Elizabeth (Maggie Steed), Maud finds half of an old, lacquered compact, of the type women would have carried in the late 1940s—precisely when Maud’s sister, Sukey (Sophie Rundle), disappeared without a trace. When Elizabeth fails to show up the next day at the “Sally Army” (the local Salvation Army thrift store), Maud immediately assumes the worst—she has a sticky note, after all, confirming that Elizabeth was supposed to arrive. We viewers, however, aren’t quite sure whether Maud, in her mental wanderings, isn’t conflating Elizabeth’s no-show with the truly traumatic mystery of her sister’s disappearance 70 years past.<br />This 90-minute “Masterpiece” presentation of “Elizabeth Is Missing,” for which Ms. Jackson won a BAFTA after it aired in the U.K. last year, keeps one guessing throughout, although the experience is very much about the lead performance; it comes very close to too close for comfort for anyone who’s dealt with a person with Alzheimer’s. The frustrations of Maud—and her family, of course—are expressed with a sympathetic eloquence by Ms. Jackson and her co-stars, notably Ms. Behan and Nell Williams as Katy, Maud’s plucky, punky granddaughter. But Ms. Jackson, who is in her 80s herself, also makes Maud’s physical fragility an element of the suspense—she seems to be falling forward wherever she goes, and you’re never sure she’s going to reach a destination. Maud’s mental state is something else: Her own failing memory infuriates her, but so does the dismissive attitude she gets from those around her, including a policeman who assures her with a chuckle that all available units on land and in the air are looking for Elizabeth. For all the villainy in “Elizabeth Is Missing,” his is perhaps the most repellent. But no one takes Maud seriously—just as no one believed the local madwoman (Cara Kelly) who haunted their village back in 1949, and who seemed to know how and why—and with whom—Sukey had vanished.<br />“Elizabeth Is Missing” was adapted by Andrea Gibb from the 2014 novel by Emma Healey, who based her book on her grandparents and not only understood how dementia appears to the outside world but the conflict it generates in the hearts of those who live with it—not just those afflicted themselves, but those who are entrusted with their care and who eventually become strangers in their eyes. Ms. Jackson has always shown herself to be an exacting and gifted artist, but Maud Horsham is the kind of role that requires much more out of a performer than just actorly craft. And that, happily, is what we get.</td>

Tiffany Haddish mourns the loss of casual sex, Natasha Rothwell sends up TV cops, Rachel Brosnahan bids farewell to pants, and Patti Harrison says a few words about the downfall of “rich girl Instagram influencers.”<br />“This is a shocking loss,” she says, “for their family, fans, followers and their branded partnerships with Smartwater.”</td>

      <td>We asked 200 design pros which trends feel fresh vs. finished. They forecast a hunger for hushed, murky rooms and hardware-less cupboards—and a quick fade for farmhouse white and open kitchen shelving.</td>
      <td>DESIGNERS LIKE Lance Thomas see the serendipitous upside of 2020’s quarantine. “It has forced homeowners to evaluate how they live in their homes, how it makes them feel,” said the principal and co-owner of Thomas Guy Interiors in Lake Charles, La. And judging from some of the incoming trends our panel of design pros identified, the feeling most people seek is cushy, coddling comfort. Rich, deep colors replace the chilly white of Modern Farmhouse décor. Earthy, touchable materials push aside the glitz of lacquered finishes and shiny fabrics. When Andrew Kline, design director at New York’s Workshop/APD, called out nubby bouclé fabric and warm woods such as walnut, he commented, “I think this speaks to that need to create a cocoon at home, so that when you shut down your laptop and dim the lights, you’re no longer in your ‘office.’” Here, the decorating styles our experts consider past their “best before” date and the trends that will replace them in 2021.<br />While we still need me-time in the bath to maintain our sanity, the white-on-white loo has lost its allure. “Bathrooms have become less austere, less like operating theaters,” said Boston designer Mally Skok. Once-popular materials are faltering. “Bookmatched marble is so beautiful, but it’s almost echo-y white. It feels cold,” said Ms. Skok. And Sara Hillery, a designer in Richmond, Va., finds fabricated quartz looks too manufactured: “Design trends are headed toward a softer, more natural look, and these man-made options fall short.”<br />Meanwhile, the al fresco shower has acquired powerful appeal, part of the continuing push to “make the outdoor as well-designed and comfortable as the indoor,” as New York architect West Chin put it. San Francisco designer Jay Jeffers, who often installs showers like the one at right on clients’ properties in Napa Valley, points to the dreamy sense of escape they conjure. “You’re almost in a different world—Mexico or the Cayman Islands or Anguilla—somewhere else that’s not your home.”<br />Miami designer Allen Saunders, among others, foresees a rejection of slick surfaces in general. Mr. Jeffers zeroed in on shiny fabrics, a played-out way to bestow a design scheme with glossy glamour. “They give this connotation of a dressier room, which people are just not as excited about these days,” he said. As pillows or upholstery, these light-catching lamés and shimmery satins not only look chilly, they skimp on tactile comfort. “They’re a little harder in terms of their touch and hand,” he said.<br />We’re gravitating to touchable textiles like velvet, mohair and soft bouclé, said Robbie McMillan, co-owner and lead designer of AubreyMaxwell in San Francisco. “Bouclé is everywhere,” concurred Mr. Kline. “We have nowhere to go in our Chanel blazers, so we’re translating the look to sofas,” he said. Elizabeth Cooper, another Bay Area designer, highlighted furry alternatives such as alpaca (see the Arhaus pillow at right), while Bethesda, Md., designer Marika Meyer likes the tactility of crewel embroidery.</td>

      <td>Biden’s DHS pick led virus responses and implemented DACA; awarding of green cards to wealthy, politically connected investors will likely draw scrutiny</td>
      <td>If there is something supporters and opponents of Alejandro Mayorkas agree on, it is that President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for Homeland Security secretary would bring a wealth of experience to the job.<br />As the department’s deputy secretary during the Obama administration, Mr. Mayorkas led responses to Ebola and the Zika virus, along with strengthening the department’s cybersecurity capabilities—experiences that will be crucial as the country faces a continuing pandemic and a recent high-profile hack of government servers.<br />Having served as the head of the government’s legal-immigration agency before then, he would bring more immigration experience than any previous secretary, an asset in the eyes of the Biden team, who want someone in place to begin quickly unwinding President Trump’s immigration agenda. That combination would also come in handy if, as many analysts predict, one of Mr. Mayorkas’s first crises on the job becomes a surge of migrant children and families arriving at the southern border.<br />That record raises issues for some GOP senators, who point to what they view as serious missteps as reasons he isn’t fit for the job. Mr. Mayorkas, while serving as U.S. attorney in Los Angeles in the late 1990s, advocated for President Bill Clinton to grant clemency for the son of a political ally. At DHS, the department’s inspector general criticized his handling of green cards for wealthy investors connected to prominent Democrats.<br />Republicans boycotted his 2013 hearing to become deputy secretary, and he ultimately won confirmation on a 54-41 party-line vote. Should Republicans retain control of the Senate after the Georgia Senate runoffs in January, those same issues will likely dominate Mr. Mayorkas’s nomination hearing.</td>

Then on Wednesday, Fulham requested that its game against Tottenham be rescheduled just hours before it was due to kick off due to “a number of players showing symptoms,” the league said.<br />This comes on top of the league reporting a new high of 18 positive cases from its most recent round of testing and at least one manager, Southampton’s Ralph Hasenhuttl, coaching his team from home this week. The timing of the surge couldn’t be worse: the holiday period is the densest part of the Premier League’s schedule and teams have been visibly exhausted.<br />“Match at 6 p.m…We still don’t know if we play,” Tottenham’s exasperated manager José Mourinho wrote on Instagram before his game was postponed. “Best league in the world.”<br />The entire Fulham squad was due to be retested in the hopes of making its next game against Burnley on Sunday. Manchester City, meanwhile, expected Sunday’s trip to Chelsea to go ahead after a new round of testing returned no further positives, the league said.</td>

The government’s information minister said all the members of the cabinet were safe following the attack. A deputy minister of public works was killed in the attack, officials said.<br />“The cowardly terrorist act that targeted Aden airport is part of the war being waged against the Yemeni state and our great people, and it will only deepen our resolve to fulfill our duties” said Maeen Abdulmalek Saeed, the prime minister in the new government, in a tweet.<br />The Yemeni interior ministry affiliated with the Saudi-backed government said 22 people were killed in the attack and more than 50 wounded. The local branch of Doctors Without Borders, the international medical relief charity, said it was preparing for a “mass casualty” event.</td>

      <td>New research shows that the psychological benefits of dog ownership are real —and especially valuable during the pandemic.</td>
      <td>Psychologist Susan Pinker explores new discoveries in the science of human nature. Read previous columns here.<br /><br />Last summer my life was upended when I was given an oversize 4-month-old puppy for my birthday. Otis’s arrival created joy and anxiety in equal measure. Already well into the pandemic, my husband and I wondered what effect this shaggy, disoriented creature would have on us. Would he provide comfort? Or would his chewing, nipping, soiling, lunging and barking only multiply our stresses?<br />By April 2020, the adoption rate for dogs in the U.S. had increased by more than 30%, according to Sara Kent, CEO of the nonprofit database Shelter Animals Count. By year’s end, spending on pet care and supplies had reached a record $99 billion. Lots of Americans expect dogs to lift their spirits, it seems.<br />We’re not alone: A new study of the human-dog relationship during the early days of the pandemic, by Liat Morgan and her research team at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of British Columbia, found that in Israel, too, dog adoptions ramped up as social and economic restrictions increased. Disasters like earthquakes and floods usually prompt people to give up their pets, but the study found that during the pandemic, far fewer people relinquished their pets to shelters—a trend echoed in the U.S., said Ms. Kent.</td>

      <td>Its monomaniacal pursuit undermines other values—true equality among them.</td>
      <td>President-elect Biden promises “the single most diverse cabinet, based on race, color, based on gender, that has ever existed in the United States of America.” Diversity, and its brother-in-law Inclusivity, is at the center of progressive politics and of woke culture. But what is its true value?<br />Diversity is a serious plank in the platform for equality generally: equality, be it noted, not of opportunity but of result. Diversity—in universities, corporations, government, TV commercials—is in part a deliberate attempt to make amends for past injustices. The intention is to bring minority groups out from their positions of marginality into the center of institutions, politics and culture generally.<br />Universities employ deans and associate provosts whose entire task is to foster diversity. One such person was recently hired “to realize an ideal Northwestern University where community members are challenged to engage differences as strengths in an environment that ensures equality of access, opportunity, participation and representation.” When I spoke to a friend who teaches at Northwestern about what seemed to me the emptiness and unnecessary expense of such a job, he corrected me, at least partly, by pointing out that without such an administrator for diversity the school might be denied federal funds for scientific and other projects.<br />There’s nothing wrong with the idealistic yearning for equality unless it gets in the way of other important goals or goods. The ideal of promised equality under communism, for example, annihilated the ideal of personal liberty. The political philosopher Isaiah Berlin often wrote about the conflict that arises when two good qualities compete. Great goods, Berlin thought, sometimes cannot live together: “We are doomed to choose, and every choice may entail an irreparable loss.” Is diversity, in higher education and in politics, always the right choice?<br />In contemporary higher education, diversity competes with intellectual authority, based on scholarly and scientific accomplishment. These days, diversity is all but victorious and intellectual authority well in retreat. This leaves no one in a position to set or determine educational standards. University presidents, once educational leaders, now focus on fundraising and public relations. The heads of academic departments tend to accept their jobs not out of a desire for intellectual leadership but to reduce their teaching loads. Because of this want of intellectual authority, universities have now been on the slide for many years.</td>

      <td>Louisiana Rep.-elect Luke Letlow died of Covid-19, just days before the Republican was set to be sworn in as a new member of Congress, his spokesman said Tuesday. He was 41.<br />Mr. Letlow won a runoff election this month to replace his former boss, Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham, who represents the Fifth Congressional District in the state. It is the state’s largest district and mostly rural, covering the northeastern and central parts of the state.<br />“The family appreciates the numerous prayers and support over the past days but asks for privacy during this difficult and unexpected time,” said Andrew Bautsch, the Letlow family representative.<br />Mr. Letlow was set to be sworn-in on Jan. 3. Though new to elected office, he wasn’t new to Congress. He served as Mr. Abraham’s chief of staff, interned for former Republican Rep. John Cooksey, and worked for Republican Bobby Jindal when Mr. Jindal was in Congress and later served on his gubernatorial staff, according to the Monroe News Star newspaper.<br />He is survived by his wife and two young children. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said on Twitter he had spoken to Mr. Letlow’s wife, Julia, and offered his condolences. Other Louisiana officials mourned the loss.</td>

      <td>Today’s challenge is different. Beijing has economic power Moscow could only dream of.</td>
      <td>American relations with China are at their lowest point in 50 years. Some say Donald Trump has bequeathed Joe Biden a new cold war, which they define as intense competition without shooting. But it is not yet a cold war, and Mr. Trump isn’t the sole source of the problem.<br />In the past decade, Chinese leaders abandoned Deng Xiaoping’s moderate policy of biding their time. They became more assertive, building artificial islands in the South China Sea and coercing Australia economically. On trade, China tilted the playing field with subsidies to state-owned enterprises and forced intellectual-property transfer. Mr. Trump was clumsy in responding with tariffs on both allies and China, but he was correct to defend against Chinese companies like Huawei, whose plans to build 5G networks pose a security threat.<br />It is a mistake, however, to think we can decouple our economy completely from China without enormous economic costs. That is why the cold war metaphor is misleading. In the Cold War, the Soviet Union was a direct military and ideological threat to the U.S., and the two countries had almost no economic or social interdependence. The U.S. does half a trillion dollars in trade annually with China, not to mention the millions of social interchanges like tourism. China has learned to harness the creativity of markets to authoritarian Communist Party control in ways the Soviets never mastered.<br />The U.S. and its allies aren’t threatened by the export of communism—few are taking to the streets in favor of Mr. Xi’s ideology—but by a hybrid system of economic and political interdependence that China can manipulate. More countries count China than the U.S. as their leading trade partner. Partial decoupling on security issues like Huawei is necessary, but total economic decoupling would be costly, and few allies would follow suit.<br />Moreover, with regard to the ecological aspects of interdependence such as climate change and pandemics, the laws of physics and biology make decoupling impossible. No country can solve transnational problems alone. The politics of global interdependence involves using power with others as well as over others. For better and worse, we are locked in a “cooperative rivalry” with China in which we need a strategy that can accomplish two contradictory things at the same time. This isn’t like Cold War containment.</td>

Queen Elizabeth II is expected to give her formal assent to the legislation at around midnight, the final step in the U.K.’s legislative process.<br />The tight timetable reflects the need to ratify the agreement before the end of the year, or risk economic disruption and legal uncertainty as a yearlong transition period to smooth the U.K.’s EU exit comes to an end. Many lawmakers opposed to Brexit said they would vote reluctantly in favor of the U.K.-EU treaty, as the only alternative is a messy close to the saga.<br />Speaking in Parliament at the opening of Wednesday’s debate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the treaty represented a new beginning for the U.K. and the EU.<br />“What we wanted was not a rupture but a resolution—a resolution of the old, tired, vexed question of Britain’s political relations with Europe, which has bedeviled our postwar history,” he said.</td>

      <td>NEW YEAR’S resolutions never worked for me, but perimenopause got me to rethink my cooking and eating for the long haul.<br />The random pain, indigestion, fatigue and inflammation led me to ask my mother, 85, about going through “the change.” She sympathized but explained that her generation of Vietnamese women didn’t know of menopause. “It didn’t exist to us. We just endured,” she said. “Stay busy so you don’t focus on it.”<br />My contemporaries told another story. “It takes over your life,” one friend said. “It’s something different every day,” said another. My primary-care physician offered practical advice: Monitor what’s going on and if it doesn’t stick, you’re likely OK.<br />Many of my issues were gut-related—hardly surprising, given my career. For nearly 20 years I’d been paid to cook, eat, drink, travel and write. Dealing with a BMI on the edge of being overweight and negotiating renegade hormones, my 50-year-old body called for a course correction. Not prepared to give up entirely on foods I relish, I struck a new balance by consuming less refined sugar and white rice, and majorly boosting my vegetable intake. That didn’t mean I relegated meat to a side dish or cancelled it altogether, but I did commit to sourcing my meals from both the plant and animal kingdoms.<br />During the pandemic, I’ve gravitated to comforting dishes like Chinese mapo tofu, which combines a few ounces of meat and a pound of tofu in a satisfying blend that’s just rich enough. It got me thinking about tofu as a versatile flavor sponge and ultimately led me to combine it with a mix of ground meats in a made-over meatloaf.</td>

True, with interest rates near zero, money is cheap—but it isn’t free. Adding that much to the national debt for stimulus of questionable efficacy now consumes political and financial breathing room that might be better saved for later.<br />The political appeal is obvious. Mr. Trump would get credit for showering more money on Americans. Democrats, who initially wanted $3 trillion of stimulus instead of last week’s $900 billion, hope to embarrass congressional Republicans into either voting for something they don’t want or crossing Mr. Trump.</td>

      <td>Chinese economic strength seems likely to continue in 2021 as global trade keeps recovering and consumers regain confidence</td>
      <td>China began 2020 negotiating a treacherous exit from an extended trade war, and then was immediately plunged into the battle against Covid-19. Twelve months later it has emerged, improbably, as the large economy in the best shape.<br />That strength seems likely to continue in 2021 as global trade keeps recovering and Chinese consumers—badly hit by the lockdowns in early 2020—regain their confidence. In the second half of the year, slowing real-estate and infrastructure investment could prove to be headwinds, although China still seems likely to outperform most major economies. In the longer term, the nation’s outlook still depends on how it manages deteriorating relations with developed democracies and whether President Xi Jinping’s strategy of cross-fertilization between the state and China’s dynamic private sector can really deliver higher efficiency and technological progress.<br />The case for slowing investment in real estate—a big chunk of the economy which also tends to drive global commodity markets—is straightforward. With retail sales and private-sector investment already back to growth and exports roaring, the policy rationale for keeping mortgage rates low to goose construction is less compelling. Short-term borrowing rates already have risen substantially since June and now sit roughly where they were in late 2019. Mortgage rates, which fell much less than short-term borrowing rates to begin with this year, seem likely to follow soon. Meanwhile weaker gains in house prices and pricier bond financing will squeeze developers.<br />Luckily, China’s consumers are in decent shape to pick up the slack. China’s household savings rate was still about 3 percentage points higher in the third quarter of 2020 than in late 2019 before Covid-19 hit, notes Oxford Economics—implying further room for catch-up growth in spending. Meanwhile, on the external front, China may lose some export market share in late 2021 as other industrial economies ramp back up, but since the overall global economic pie will be growing faster, China’s shipments will probably hold up, too.<br />Further out, the picture gets more uncertain. With China and the European Union poised to sign a long-stalled bilateral investment treaty, Biden administration efforts to isolate Beijing may be off to a rocky start. But in the longer term, European governments and companies may still struggle to explain to citizens or customers why they are so willing to overlook China’s human rights abuses, including the large-scale internment of China’s Uighur minority in Xinjiang. And China’s demographic advantage is eroding rapidly, meaning boosting productivity is critical. Its pivot toward an import substitution-like economic strategy in high technology carries substantial risk, especially without much-needed financial reforms.</td>

      <td>The holiday season is almost over, but for many gift-givers, the tab won’t come due until well into 2021.<br />Millions of U.S. consumers, looking to stretch their dollars and avoid taking on new credit-card debt during the coronavirus pandemic, flocked in recent months to “buy now, pay later” offers from financial-technology companies including Affirm Holdings Inc.,  Afterpay Ltd.  and Klarna Bank AB.<br />In November, the cumulative number of U.S. shoppers that had opened an Afterpay account exceeded 13 million, and 7.5 million of them had made a purchase using Afterpay in the previous 12 months. Also in November, purchase volume among Afterpay’s U.S. users reached more than 1 billion Australian dollars, equivalent to more than $770 million and roughly triple the level a year earlier. (Afterpay is based in Australia and reports its figures in the local currency.) Klarna had counted 11 million total U.S. users as of October, two million of which used the Klarna app in the preceding month. The number of annually active Affirm users reached 3.9 million as of Sept. 30, up 63% from a year earlier.<br />“You think of the Zooms of the world, for example, the delivery services of the world—some businesses were really lucky to do well during Covid, and I think we were one of those really fortunate businesses,” said David Sykes, the head of Klarna’s U.S. unit.<br />Investors are taking notice. The price of shares in Afterpay, which trade in Australia and the U.S., has quadrupled since the start of 2020. Affirm filed paperwork last month with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering that could value the San Francisco startup at as much as $10 billion, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Klarna recently became one of Europe’s most valuable privately held tech companies after a fundraising round pegged the worth of the Swedish company at $10.65 billion.</td>

Instead, incumbents and rookies alike feasted on a base of shut-in customers eager for more things to watch.<br />The largest streaming services are expected to finish 2020 with combined U.S. subscriber numbers more than 50% higher than a year ago, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from market-research firms MoffettNathanson LLC and HarrisX.<br />They enjoyed a captive audience. The coronavirus pandemic triggered lockdowns that sent millions of Americans home, leaving many people with more time to watch movies and shows from the couch. The virus also prompted movie theaters to shut down and sports leagues to go on hiatus for months, further boosting streaming services’ appeal.<br />“Instead of a streaming war, there’s been streaming coexistence and parallel growth,” said Dritan Nesho, HarrisX’s chief executive. New services such as Walt Disney Co.’s Disney+ grew rapidly without necessarily harming established players such as  Netflix Inc.  and Hulu, he said.<br />“Disney+ did not displace existing services,” Mr. Nesho said. “It complemented them.”</td>

The scenic property, in a high-end neighborhood called Shouson Hill, includes six low-rise buildings with 26 apartments and a rooftop swimming pool.<br />A representative of the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong previously said the sale of the Shouson Hill compound was purely the result of a business decision, made as part of a global reinvestment program by the State Department.<br />The deal didn’t close on Dec. 30 as scheduled. On Wednesday, Hang Lung said it was informed last week by Hong Kong’s Land Registry that the sale can’t be completed without the written consent of the Chinese government.<br />China’s imposition of a national-security law on Hong Kong this year has helped stoke tensions between Washington and Beijing.

      <td>THE LAST THING anyone needed was another virtual meeting. And yet, in October, more than 1,100 fans of radicchio tuned in to “Rad TV,” a day’s worth of YouTube programming to fete their favorite bitter vegetable. Academics retold its history (did you know radicchio only became a staple in Italy in the 20th century?), plant breeders shared growing techniques, chefs demo’d recipes such as radicchio tarte tatin and grilled radicchio salad with anchovy dressing.<br />Bitter vegetables don’t usually have fan clubs. But radicchio, a kind of chicory, has earned a passionate following of small farmers, chefs and plant breeders who prize its capacity to grow in cold temperatures—keeping farmers busy during the slow season—as well as its flavor and range of vivid hues. Most of us know (and most supermarkets offer) the densely layered, burgundy-leaved Radicchio di Chioggia. Other tempting varieties include the pale-green, speckled Variegato di Castelfranco, the delicate, pink Rosa del Veneto and the oblong, almost tentacled Rosso di Treviso Tardivo. These are seasonal, available now through early spring.<br />Besides being gorgeous, the fresh, grilled or wilted leaves set off the season’s rich, fatty foods and add much-missed freshness to a winter plate. And unlike those wimpy, bagged salad greens, radicchio will last weeks in the fridge.</td>

It commits Beijing to end forced technology transfers and increase transparency over how it subsidizes firms.<br />European officials say they are gaining more than they are giving in the deal, which has won backing from leaders of all 27 EU countries but still needs their governments’ formal approval and will face a vote in the European Parliament. The Europeans also say the pact provides similar advantages to those the U.S. gained when it signed its “phase-one” trade agreement with China, which took effect early this year.<br />Critics of the deal in both the U.S. and Europe say that even if it gives the EU short-term commercial gains, it binds the bloc’s economy more closely to China’s and could help build the increasingly authoritarian country’s economic might just as Western leaders are working to check it.<br />U.S. officials have also expressed concern that the accord will help Beijing deflect external pressure to reform its state-driven economic model. Critics say Beijing has acceded to long-sought European requests in part because it wants to divide Brussels and Washington.</td>

It stressed that vaccine recipients would still get a second dose, just three months later than planned.<br />Some provinces in Canada have been delaying the second dose to inoculate more people at once, and Belgium is considering a similar approach.</td>

Instead it has started using third-party employees, a first for the company.<br />Gig-economy companies say reclassifying workers as employees would add to costs, reduce workers’ flexibility and result in lost jobs.

      <td>Regulatory outlook appears promising, and Covid-19 vaccines could give the industry political capital</td>
      <td>In the year ahead, investors should expect Big Pharma to have its wallet open. Investors hunting for buyouts should think big.<br />Total deal volume for the drug industry has reached $253 billion globally so far this year, according to Dealogic. That is down from a record $432 billion in 2019. The onset of the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with election-related uncertainty over future industry regulations meant fewer large deals were agreed upon.<br />Investors are expecting that to change, and for good reason. For starters, the regulatory outlook seems far brighter than some had feared. President-elect Joe Biden did vow to implement tough new drug-pricing measures during the campaign. But with the pandemic still unfolding, it is unlikely to be a priority for the administration.<br />The ultimate balance of power in the Senate is still uncertain, but the blue wave that investors feared ahead of the election didn’t materialize. Even with a narrow Democratic majority, getting broad legislation through the Senate will be a challenge. And while Big Pharma is always a popular target for politicians, the industry might get some political capital from having developed safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines in record time.<br />As such, deal activity has picked up lately. This month,  AstraZeneca  agreed to purchase  Alexion Pharmaceuticals  for $39 billion in cash and stock, and  Eli Lilly  agreed to buy gene-therapy startup  Prevail Therapeutics  for $880 million in upfront cash and more than $1 billion if certain development milestones are reached.</td>

      <td>LONDON—The U.K. authorized a Covid-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC, opening the door for the rollout of millions of doses in a country where infections have surged amid a more infectious variant of the virus.<br />The green light represents the third emergency-use approval of a Western-developed vaccine this month and comes as cases rise sharply in the U.S. and Europe. A shot developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and Germany’s  BioNTech  SE and one by  Moderna Inc.  have both been cleared in the U.S. and are being distributed there.<br />AstraZeneca’s shot—less effective in clinical trials than its rivals’ injections—won’t be available in the U.S. until the Food and Drug Administration reviews large-scale trials still being conducted there and decides to authorize its use.<br />The U.K. authorization comes as the country battles a new, potentially more contagious variant of the coronavirus, which has now also been recorded in the U.S.<br />The mutated virus triggered travel bans recently on visitors and goods from Britain, ratcheting up the political urgency for a speedy vaccine rollout here. Pfizer’s shot is already available in the U.K., and Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Dec. 21 that half a million of the first of a two-dose regimen had been administered.</td>

      <td>Activist call to evaluate strategic options could help chip maker make some painful choices</td>
      <td>Chip making is a complicated business. Fixing a broken chip maker is more complicated still.<br />Such was laid bare by a letter to  Intel Corp.  Tuesday from well-known shareholder activist Dan Loeb of Third Point. The letter comes months after the chip maker disclosed new problems with its latest manufacturing process that put it even further behind  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , or TSMC. It also comes just a few weeks before Intel is expected to announce whether it will begin outsourcing some future manufacturing needs to its rival, as part of an effort to rectify the problem. That announcement is expected in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call, scheduled for Jan. 21.<br />Mr. Loeb appears to disfavor this strategy, citing the “vital role” Intel plays in national security by maintaining domestic chip-making capabilities. But his suggestion that Intel engage a “reputable investment advisor” to help it evaluate whether it should even remain an integrated chip manufacturer could add to the problem, as the most natural buyers for Intel’s manufacturing operations are all overseas. Advanced Micro Devices Inc., or AMD, spun off its manufacturing arm more than a decade ago. That business, GlobalFoundries, is now majority owned by an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government.<br />And any buyer will be left with the same vexing problem of how to catch up to TSMC if it wants to remain competitive. New chip-making processes spend years in development before they get to high-volume manufacturing. And even if Intel fixes the issues it reported in July for its 7-nanometer process under development, the company is still well behind TSMC, which is already shipping even more advanced chips at 5 nanometers—including  Apple Inc.’s  new processors for its latest generation of iPhones.<br />But Mr. Loeb also called on Intel to evaluate the “potential divestment of certain failed acquisitions,” which might prove to be more helpful in the meantime. While he didn’t specify any particular deals, the company’s two largest to date—programmable chip specialist Altera and driver-assistance systems designer Mobileye—have done little to change its fortunes. Pressure from an activist could give Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan the cover needed to unwind some of those deals, which could raise capital and help Intel focus on the problems at hand.</td>

      <td>The Fed’s stance means the greenback’s weakness is likely to continue, but that isn’t a disaster for investors who position themselves correctly</td>
      <td>There are many reasons to expect a weaker U.S. dollar next year and perhaps for longer, but none more important than the new policy stance of the Federal Reserve.<br />The U.S. dollar briefly rallied in March due to its haven role in investment portfolios. Since then, it has dropped around 12% against a trade-weighted basket of currencies as the U.S. turned out to be even harder hit by the coronavirus pandemic than most major economies.<br />As vaccines are rolled out and the global economy snaps back, this trade won’t necessarily run in reverse. Rather, currencies of countries that export commodities and manufactured goods are likely to keep strengthening against the dollar, as would be seen in a typical global recovery. Some Asian exporters already are quietly intervening to limit their currencies’ rise.<br />But this time, reasons to expect a weaker dollar run even deeper. For several years before the pandemic, U.S. interest rates on both the long and short ends of the yield curve were substantially higher than in Europe and Japan—a major source of strength for the U.S. currency. That premium has largely disappeared, though, as the Fed lowered short-term rates to near zero and launched a new round of asset purchases. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes has fallen from almost 2% at the start of the year to around 0.93% now.<br />Granted, that is still well higher than the 0.02% and minus-0.58% yields on 10-year Japanese and German government bonds, respectively. But real yields in the U.S. are in fact lower on an inflation-adjusted basis, points out markets economist Simona Gambarini of Capital Economics. In the U.S., the core consumer-price index was 1.6% higher than a year earlier in November. That compares with slight deflation in Japan and the eurozone.</td>

Families and attorneys they hired to represent the activists haven’t been allowed to contact them. The defendants were appointed attorneys from the mainland, and their trial was held behind closed doors this week.<br />“They didn’t have proper legal representation, were detained in secret for months and the verdict was handed down after a secret trial,” said Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy politician who has been coordinating with the families of the 12. “The whole legal process is a joke but with serious consequences—we don’t even know how to appeal the sentence.”<br />The U.S. called for the release of the activists earlier this week. Foreign diplomats attempted to attend the trial but weren’t allowed inside.</td>

      <td>In Italy over 11% of the banks’ assets are in government debt, a record</td>
      <td>European banks are doing something that got them into trouble years ago: loading up on government debt, a trade investors call the “doom loop.”<br />Banks in the eurozone, stuffed with excess cash thanks to Covid-19 central bank relief efforts, bought close to €200 billion, the equivalent of $245 billion, in government debt of their home countries in the year to September. That has raised their holdings by 19% to €1.2 trillion, according to the European Central Bank.<br />This comes against the backdrop of massive government and central bank support packages that have buoyed assets. The ECB has been buying big quantities of eurozone government bonds, keeping their prices stable and making the investment safe for banks.<br />The fear is that behind the support lies increasingly fragile government finances, as countries borrow aggressively to counteract the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />It rekindles memories of Europe’s last financial crisis early last decade. In 2012, what started as a struggle by weaker eurozone countries to repay debts turned into a financial-sector crisis. Banks held mountains of government bonds that fell in value, triggering a spiral of ratings downgrades that sent bank borrowing costs up, leading to a credit crunch that slowed economic growth. That hit government finances and perpetuated the doom loop between banks and their sovereigns.</td>

The default occurred just weeks after the company, Yongcheng Coal & Electricity Holding Group Co., raised the same amount from a sale of three-year-debt.<br />The series of events spooked investors, triggering price declines that pushed up bond yields and raised borrowing costs for other companies.<br />The National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors, a self-regulatory organization overseen by China’s central bank, said Chengxin failed to conduct on-site investigations and interviews with Yongcheng’s management personnel. It said the ratings firm didn’t take steps to verify and investigate delays in salary payments and debt-repayment arrangements, and didn’t adequately disclose the company’s credit risks.<br />Chengxin has been suspended from rating new interbank bond issues for three months, the NAFMII said.

Argentina will now permit elective abortion up to the 14th week of pregnancy, scrapping current legislation that only allows the procedure when a pregnancy results from rape or when a mother’s health is at risk.<br />The outcome was a blow to the ever-expanding evangelical movement and the Catholic Church in the country of 45 million. Pope Francis, who was born in Argentina, had actively backed antiabortion groups.<br />It is a momentous victory for a feminist movement, known for its green bandannas and energetic demonstrations, that didn’t give up even after the senate had rejected an abortion legalization bill just two years ago.<br />Although the movement had been around for years, it had gained strength following huge protests in 2015 triggered by the slaying of a 14-year-old pregnant girl.

Mr. Sheikh was originally sentenced to death and has been imprisoned for the past 18 years. The kidnapping charge carries a sentence of only seven years.<br />Pakistani authorities have been searching for a way to keep Mr. Sheikh detained—including appealing to the country’s Supreme Court to reinstate the conviction. Acting U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said Tuesday that if the authorities are unsuccessful, the U.S. was prepared to take the man into custody and pursue the case in the American court system.<br />“We remain grateful for the Pakistani government’s actions to appeal such rulings to ensure that he and his co-defendants are held accountable. If, however, those efforts do not succeed, the United States stands ready to take custody of Omar Sheikh to stand trial here. We cannot allow him to evade justice for his role in Daniel Pearl’s abduction and murder,” Mr. Rosen said.<br />The late Mr. Pearl was a veteran Wall Street Journal correspondent. While serving as the newspaper’s bureau chief for South Asia and reporting in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi in January 2002, he was kidnapped and killed by Islamic extremists. At the time, Mr. Pearl was reporting for an article about religious extremists in Pakistan as part of the paper’s coverage in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S.</td>

      <td>The feds seek billions in penalties for filling valid opioid prescriptions.</td>
      <td>One benefit of the Trump era has been the relative absence of dubious lawsuits against business. An exception is the Justice Department’s new suit against  Walmart  for filling opioid prescriptions.<br />The lawsuit in federal court in Delaware claims that Walmart “failed to detect and report at least hundreds of thousands of suspicious orders” and that as a pharmacy it “unlawfully filled thousands upon thousands of invalid controlled-substance prescriptions.” These actions enabled opioid abuse and “helped fuel a national crisis,” the feds say.<br />The complaint alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations, but it is really a 160-page exercise in scapegoating a company because it is well-known and has deep pockets. Walmart doesn’t push pills on opioid addicts. Its pharmacists fill valid prescriptions written by doctors who are licensed by their states and registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).<br />When Walmart’s pharmacists catch a prescription that appears fraudulent or forged, they are trained to refuse to fill it and document the incident. Walmart says it has passed tens of thousands of leads about suspicious prescriptions to state and federal law enforcement. It's the job of the DEA and state medical boards to investigate and revoke doctors’ licenses and prescribing privileges if there’s wrongdoing.<br />Yet the DEA rarely imposes such restrictions on physicians, and Walmart has no authority to act on its own. When pharmacists have refused to fill questionable prescriptions, doctors have sometimes sued for defamation and patients have sometimes sued for discrimination. Several states have prohibited pharmacists from interfering with the doctor-patient relationship by second-guessing valid prescriptions.</td>

      <td>‘Why can’t I show the truth?’ Zhang Zhan dared to ask.</td>
      <td>A Chinese court Monday sentenced 37-year-old Zhang Zhan to four years in prison for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” but her real offense was telling the truth about the government’s early mishandling of Covid.<br />Ms. Zhang rushed to Wuhan in early 2020 to report on the coronavirus outbreak and the government’s response. She visited hospitals and crematoriums, interviewed terrified Wuhan locals, posted more than 120 video clips on YouTube, and shared her insights with foreign media. On  Twitter  she observed that “the party flags and red symbols at many neighborhood entrances all indicate that epidemic-prevention isn’t important. Protecting regime stability that has been impacted by the pandemic is the actual goal.”<br />Ms. Zhang’s reporting came as Beijing was trying to gaslight the world into believing it had responded to the outbreak competently and transparently. She knew the risks of contradicting the official narrative. She had reported on the disappearance of other journalists.<br />“Maybe I have a rebellious soul . . . I’m just documenting the truth. Why can’t I show the truth? I won’t stop what I’m doing because this country can’t go backwards,” Ms. Zhang said in one video clip obtained by the BBC.<br />In mid-May, Ms. Zhang went missing, and her friends learned she’d been arrested. Her lawyers say authorities have restrained and force-fed her after she went on a hunger strike. Zhang Keke, her attorney, has described how she recites passages from the Bible for comfort but “feels psychologically exhausted, like every day is a torment.” Ms. Zhang appeared in court Monday in a wheelchair, her lawyers said.</td>

The split-second decision to open fire on Tamir, based on the officers’ stated belief that the toy gun was a real threat, didn’t meet that burden, according to the department.<br />“Although Tamir Rice’s death is tragic, the evidence does not meet these substantial evidentiary requirements,” the Justice Department said.</td>

      <td>U.S. troops can’t be everywhere forever. But the Trump Administration hasn’t made a good case for its recently announced withdrawal from Somalia in Northeast Africa.<br />President Trump has often expressed his skepticism of American commitments abroad, but the Administration’s move on Somalia was relatively quiet. Mr. Trump ordered the military to “reposition the majority of personnel and assets out of Somalia by early 2021,” according to a Pentagon statement this month. “While a change in force posture, this action is not a change in U.S. policy,” the statement said. “The U.S. will retain the capability to conduct targeted counterterrorism operations in Somalia.”<br />Even if it can achieve some objectives from outside the country, it would be losing the influence that comes with the 700 U.S. troops in Somalia. Americans are still vulnerable in countries like neighboring Kenya, and the U.S. needs multiple outposts to fight active terrorist groups.<br />Since Islamic State lost its physical caliphate in Syria and Iraq, unstable parts of Africa have become more appealing for jihadists looking to claim territory and plot attacks on the West. ISIS has a small presence in Somalia but the greatest threat is al-Shabaab.<br />The U.S. has launched at least 50 airstrikes this year against the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabaab. Mr. Trump said in a June letter to congressional leaders that some U.S. forces in Somalia also “advise, assist, and accompany regional forces, including Somali and African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) forces, during counterterrorism operations.”</td>

Do you anticipate the end of Covid-19 having a similar effect?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Jan. 12. The best responses will be published that night.<br />A Tale of Two Pandemics<br />At the beginning of the pandemic, I was concerned that my elderly mother, a hairdresser, continued seeing clients at their homes despite San Francisco’s shelter-in-place orders. After all, we should have been performing our new American duty—staying at home. I pleaded with my mother to close her business, citing the grim data emphasizing increased mortality among elderly populations plastered on every front page. Reluctantly, she sheltered for a week, but soon the income loss became too much.<br />Untimely car and dental troubles depleted the savings we hoped to ration throughout the pandemic. Local and federal aid barely covered three months of living and business expenses. Every $20 haircut quickly became more valuable than our health. The irony was not lost: To survive the pandemic, we had to risk infection.<br />Meanwhile, a supposedly united America preened over its noble self-isolation—even celebrities shared the quarantine struggle, tweeting and streaming from their lavish homes. In actuality, the images populating social media were only half the story. The U.S. experience was divided: Those that possessed adequate financial capital could freely perform their civic duty while working-America compromised their safety for necessities. My low-income family was excluded from visions of a safe, socially distant society, sparking endless debates over stimulus packages that, if substantive, could allow us to shelter.</td>

      <td>Presidents are often at the mercy of unpredictable factors like the business cycle—and pandemics.</td>
      <td>President Trump’s supporters tout the economy’s pre-pandemic performance as evidence that tax cuts and deregulation were making America great again. Detractors look at the data and find these policies wanting or outweighed by the harmful effects of Mr. Trump’s aggressive approach to trade and his isolationist approach to immigration.<br />Both views are misguided. A closer look at the data from the past four years exposes the folly of inferring anything about a presidential administration from how the economy performed. Consider these four lessons:<br />Lesson 1. Presidents often get credit or blame for the economy even though uncontrollable events often matter more than policy. Consider the data for Mr. Trump’s full term. Based on the latest forecasts, the economy will have grown since the beginning of 2017 at an annual rate of about 1.5%, the worst performance of any president since Herbert Hoover. Job growth has been even more dismal, at around three million jobs lost over the past four years.<br />These numbers are obviously meaningless in assessing Mr. Trump’s economic policies given a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. While one could debate the effect on the economy of the president’s mismanagement of the public-health crisis, no one would argue that the GDP and unemployment numbers are reflective of his regulatory reforms or immigration restrictions.<br />The same point applies to other years too, even if the magnitude and causes are not nearly as stark. For example, Mr. Trump’s supporters sometimes credit him with turning the economy around because growth increased from 1.7% in 2016 to 2.3% in 2017. But much of the change is explained by an increase in the pace of exports caused by the 0.7 percentage point pickup in the growth rate of America’s trading partners in 2017. Giving Mr. Trump credit for that “turnaround” makes about as much sense as blaming him for “ruining” the economy with his terrible four-year growth rate.</td>

      <td>Covid-19 worsened a shortage of coins. Capitalism is solving the problem.</td>
      <td>Making change used to be a bit of a joke. A memorable “Saturday Night Live” parody ad in 1988 imagined the “First CityWide Change Bank,” which gave its customers the denominations they want: “If you come to us with a $100 bill, we’re not going to give you 2,000 nickels—unless that meets your particular change needs.”<br />Nowadays getting the change you want is no laughing matter. In many cities making change has become a cash cow for some because of the great U.S. coin shortage. Covid has limited banks hours and shut down the retail businesses that often return coins to circulation. It doesn’t help that Americans have a tendency to dump coins in shoeboxes and never use them again, keeping many in-circulation quarters and pennies sequestered.<br />Nickel-and-diming isn’t going away, even in the digital age—though it’s quarters in particular that are in high demand. Americans still need coins at laundromats, to pump air in their tires at gas stations and for old fashioned parking meters. It’s costly to retrofit coin-operated machines.<br />Don’t panic. Washington is coming to the rescue with its usual turtlelike agility. Officials at the U.S. Mint concede that “sometimes coins are not readily available.” The Mint’s director, David J. Ryder, has asked consumers to “help get coins moving by using exact change when making purchases, taking your coins to financial institutions, or turning them in for cash at coin recycling kiosks.” He says that production of coins is rising now given the demands.<br />As usual, the free market is way ahead of the government. Customers at the Pennsylvania-based Wawa convenience-store chain can change their coins for bills and come away with a free coffee. For one week in July, the Community State Bank in Wisconsin gave a $5 bonus for every $100 worth of coins turned in. My son tells me that San Francisco even has an active secondary market of enterprising entrepreneurs hanging out and serving as, well, “change agents.” A couple of quarters go for as much as a dollar, a roll of 40 for $11 or $12.</td>

Italy as a country ranks low on every index of efficient, accountable governments and effective legal systems. Criminalizing policy disappointments and managerial errors is a symptom of this failure, not its cure.<br />Still, the particulars of the indictment being sought by relatives of early victims will ring bells for many Americans: the shipping of infected persons to nursing homes, failure to test patients who couldn’t be connected to China, failing to order lockdowns sooner, worrying about the potential impact on businesses.<br />The U.S. remains in a similar phase of denial, with every failure related to testing, mask promotion, etc., spun as a missed chance to extinguish Covid altogether. When the reality principle intrudes, here’s suspecting the greatest failure will be the one we are least willing to acknowledge or even understand: It began with our strange reticence to acknowledge the reality of mild (and, as it turned out,  asymptomatic) Covid.<br />Any alert person knew from the get-go that, amid the exigencies of Wuhan, Chinese doctors were failing to detect mild cases, and that thousands of these cases were likely being exported to the world. Whatever the horrors in Wuhan’s hospitals, they happened not because Covid-19 is an extravagantly deadly respiratory infection. They happened because a flu-like disease had been allowed to spread unrecognized for months in an urban population unprotected by any prior immunity or vaccine.<br />Yet it instantly became a U.S. journalistic trope to accuse anyone mentioning the flu of “downplaying” the new disease—downplaying anything being the worst sin in journalism.</td>

On Dec. 18 my blog, The Naked Dollar, revealed a list of race-based demands from 120 Dalton teachers. The Naked Dollar isn’t particularly well-known, but the story quickly went global.<br />The demands read like a manifesto to codify permanently the “oppressed” status of black students and teachers. Among them:<br />• Expand the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to at least 12 staffers. That works out to about one for every 100 students and would cost at least $1.5 million a year. What will they do all day? No doubt ferret out ever subtler racist infractions, real or imagined. The diversity industry needs friction to survive, so it perpetually reworks the definition of racism.<br />• Reroute 50% of contributions to Dalton to the New York public school system. An effective 50% tax rate on donations—the lifeblood of any private school—is a good way of ensuring that alumni close their wallets. How will the school pay all those diversity officers?<br />• Compensate “any Black student or student of color” who participate in antiracism initiatives or has his images used in school publications. Financial favoritism based solely on skin color seems an invitation to a civil-rights lawsuit.</td>

      <td>Biological classiﬁcation conforms perfectly with the patterns of evolutionary relationships evidenced by anatomy, physiology and genetics.</td>
      <td>The great but grumpy biologist J.B.S. Haldane was once asked what evidence would disprove evolution, whereupon he growled: “Fossil rabbits in the Precambrian.” He was referring to the evolutionary fact that complex multicellular creatures came along later than simple, unicellular ones. A bit surprising, perhaps, that one of the foremost evolutionary geneticists of the 20th century immediately reached for a paleontological example, but Haldane’s reply was well-suited for public consumption, because then—as now—when most people thought of evolution, they were likely to conjure images of dinosaur fossils.<br />Donald Prothero is a research associate in vertebrate paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. When I learned he had written a book that examined 25 different discoveries relating to evolution, I assumed that he, like Haldane, would deploy paleontology in making his case. Mr. Prothero’s book is indeed tilted toward examples from the world of ancestral creatures, but, refreshingly, also guides the reader through impressive discoveries in embryology and molecular genetics.<br />“The Story of Evolution in 25 Discoveries” is a parade of self-contained vignettes, often including biographical sketches of the scientists who made and interpreted each discovery. This particular story begins (like everything else) with the big bang, followed by the fascinating tale of how science gradually came to understand the age of the Earth: From biblical literalism; through Lord Kelvin’s famous underestimate, in the 1890s, of 20 million years; to our current understanding of 4.5 billion years. Then comes a whirlwind tour of evolutionary change as it occurs, in real time, among microbes, plants, insects, fish, birds and mammals, obliterating the creationist canard that evolution hasn’t even been witnessed, let alone studied.<br />Some of the most impressive evolutionary stories involve common body plans, technically known as homologies. Thanks to Mr. Prothero, I now know that Aristotle first noticed this widespread phenomenon, of which Darwin wrote: “What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include similar bones, in the same relative positions?” Curious indeed. And strongly suggestive of common descent—or, for anti-evolutionists, of a Creator’s insistence on sticking with the same divine blueprint, or “archetype,” even when other more direct routes should have been available. The Darwinian story provides scientific insight into why homologies occur, whereas the theological story simply reiterates that they occur.<br />And on we go, to the embryonic similarities of otherwise distantly related creatures (“ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny”) and then biogeography (“the sinking of Noah’s Ark”), which shows, among other relevant findings, that the flora and fauna of islands resemble those of nearby continents—a phenomenon that wouldn’t necessarily be expected if each had been a special, independent creation. The story of life continues, detailing how living things within natural categories share those common body plans, or, as Darwin put it, how “organic beings have been found to resemble each other in descending degrees, so that they can be classed in groups under groups.” As a result, instead of being arbitrary, our system of biological classification conforms perfectly with the nested, branching patterns of evolutionary relationships demonstrated by anatomy, physiology and genetics. Moreover, as Mr. Prothero points out, “if life had been specially created rather than evolved, there would be no reason for the molecular systems to reflect this pattern of similarity seen in megascopic features . . . [and] not even Darwin could have dreamed that the genetic code of every cell in your body also shows the evidence of evolution.”</td>

      <td>This adaptation of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels is a comic journey into dystopian ideas.</td>
      <td>Terry Pratchett’s Discworld, the setting of 41 novels by the phenomenally prolific author, was carried on the back of four elephants and a turtle. Its TV incarnation, “The Watch,” is carried by Richard Dormer, Northern Irish actor and “Game of Thrones” veteran. His Commander Sam Vimes, as we see in episode 1, begins his career as an idealistic member of what passes for a police force in the Discworld locale of Ankh-Morpork. But after the emptying of “9321 bottles of booze,” the loss of “68,242 brain cells” and the neutering of law enforcement by the city’s administration, he has become a combination of Popeye and Keith Richards, a scowling, ambling, slightly addlepated detective who will still rise—albeit with considerable difficulty—to the occasion.<br />The advantage of adapting someone as celebrated as Pratchett, who died in 2015, is that his work comes with a built-in fan base. The downside is that said base generally takes its dystopian fantasy very seriously, even work as comic as Pratchett’s. And the fans already have an idea of what it should look like and who should play whom. I am no Pratchett authority, but Mr. Dormer presents a more than acceptable Vimes, with his antic comedic flair, the fractured cowboy rhythms of his gait and Clint Eastwood-inspired cigars that migrate from one side of his mouth to the other as he ponders the great questions of his place and time. Among them: How can the villainous but conflicted Carcer Dun (Samuel Adewunmi) still be alive, when Vimes saw his old friend-cum-foe fall to his death 20 years before? How can he not have aged a day? Is Carcer’s evil plan somehow connected to the magic afoot at Unseen University? And is a missing library book connected to the dragon attacks besieging the city?<br />And what of the City Watch, which Pratchett made the subject of so many novels? Behind every truly memorable act of predictive fantasy lies a serious idea, Pratchett’s being the benighted wisdom of the Ankh-Morpork authorities: Shortly after Vimes joined the Watch, the crime-ridden city decided to recognize and authorize guilds devoted to specific illicit pursuits—a Thieves Guild, an Assassins Guild, a Drug-Pushers Guild, even an Alchemists Guild. As long as the malefactors stayed within their quotas, they were immune to arrest or prosecution. Crime rates actually dropped. But the effect on the Watch was devastating. Dispiriting. Dissipating. Just look at Vimes.<br />The revitalization of the force is effectuated by several near-simultaneous occurrences: The re-emergence of Carcer, of course; the introduction to the Watch of Constable Carrot (Adam Hugill), a fresh-faced and very tall young lad who was raised by dwarves (and tries rather cluelessly to enforce what we’d normally think of as law); and the arrival of Lady Sybil Ramkin (Lara Rossi), a self-possessed and very capable all-around force of justice who rankles Vimes but allies with him to track down Carcer and thwart dragons. Along with them are the mysterious Angua (Marama Corlett), who happens to be a werewolf; the forensics expert Cheery (Jo Eaton-Kent) and, making an occasional cameo appearance, Death himself (Wendell Pierce).<br />The first episode of “The Watch” will play Thursday on AMC+, then again during a two-episode presentation Sunday night at 8 p.m. on BBC America with subsequent episodes materializing on AMC+ and BBC America every Sunday. “The Watch” can’t be taken as seriously as that erstwhile Sunday night staple, “Game of Thrones.” On the upside, it’s a lot more fun.</td>

      <td>The genre, which takes familiar sounds from electronic pop, rap and dance and intensifies them through compression, distortion and exaggeration, broke into the mainstream this year thanks to figures like 100 Gecs and A.G. Cook.</td>
      <td><br /><br />On Dec. 4, electro-pop outfit 100 Gecs released a new holiday-themed song, “Sympathy 4 the Grinch.” The track by the duo Dylan Brady and Laura Les is an impossibly fast and frenetic number that welds the pogoing bounce of ska with the explosive choruses of pop-punk while adding a thick coating of distorted electronics to chirpy, pitched-up vocals. Like many songs by 100 Gecs, it’s polarizing, beloved by fans for its infectious energy but seemingly designed to clear the room of anyone who doesn’t connect to their aesthetic. For those in the latter camp, it’s as annoying as music gets. The genre? It’s usually called hyperpop, and 100 Gecs, along with London producer A.G. Cook, are among its most visible proponents.<br />Hyperpop artists take familiar sounds from electronic pop, rap and dance and intensify them through compression, exaggerating the elements that scanned as “artificial”—programmed drums, Auto-Tuned vocals, the blaring synths found in videogames—to create a cartoonish wall of noise that embraces catchy tunes and memorable hooks. The music zooms between beauty and ugliness, as shimmery melodies collide with mangled instrumentation. The genre tag was originally applied in 2014 to Mr. Cook’s London-based collective and label PC Music, but now reaches much further: In August 2019, streaming platform Spotify, responding to the growing popularity of 100 Gecs, created the hyperpop playlist to highlight this scene. Many of the tracks found in the site’s survey, which currently has almost 150,000 subscribers, are created by teenagers, some as young as 15. It’s a style utterly of this moment that is also difficult to pin down, since it is continuously mutating.<br />Mr. Cook and 100 Gecs had a big year in 2020—as did hyperpop as a whole. The latter released a remix album, “1000 Gecs and the Tree of Clues,” and its two members, individually and collectively, produced music for more than a dozen songs by others, including British singer Charli XCX and bawdy Maryland rapper Rico Nasty. A.G. Cook, who is Charli XCX’s creative director, co-produced and co-wrote her excellent album “How I’m Feeling Now,” released in May; co-wrote and co-produced “Shiver” by Jónsi, frontman of Icelandic dream-rock band Sigur Rós; and issued two albums under his own name, the 49-track “7G” and the concise “Apple.” These are the most visible products of the genre’s current wave, but the scene around the sound goes much deeper and is fueled by the digital culture created by teenagers.</td>

The company has raised other forms of capital in Israel in the past from both banks and equity partners.<br />“Kushner is considering the option of issuing bonds on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange,” a company spokesman said. “The company has had years of success working with Israeli institutions as both a borrower and a partner.”<br />Israel’s bond market has become a growing source of capital for U.S. real-estate companies, including Extell Development, Silverstein Properties Inc. and Starwood Capital Group.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked an effort by Democrats to hold a vote on sending bigger stimulus checks to many Americans, amid growing calls within the GOP for the larger coronavirus-relief payments sought by President Trump.<br />The Kentucky Republican, without committing to hold a vote, said the Senate would address Mr. Trump’s demands to boost the size of the checks to $2,000 from $600 as well as his concerns about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which regulates online speech, and his complaints about purported election fraud. Mr. Trump has blamed fraud for his defeat in the November election, but no significant fraud has emerged.<br />“This week the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus,” Mr. McConnell said, without offering further details. A person familiar with his thinking said Mr. McConnell was considering putting all three items into one bill.<br />The comments came after several Republican senators, including two competing in runoffs soon that will decide control of the Senate, said they would support larger checks.<br />Mr. Trump signed a Covid-19 aid bill into law Sunday but said that the $600 payments in that package were too small. The House then moved to vote to increase the size of the checks to $2,000, which passed Monday night 275 to 134, with 44 Republicans joining almost all Democrats in support.</td>

      <td>A scientific advisory committee had advised lower limits on sugar and alcohol, citing health risks</td>
      <td>The federal government on Tuesday issued new dietary guidelines that keep current allowances for sugar and alcohol consumption unchanged, rejecting recommendations by its scientific advisory committee to make significant cuts.<br />The scientific committee, which was composed of 20 academics and doctors, had recommended cutting the limit for added sugars in the diet to 6% of daily calories from 10% in the current guidelines, citing rising rates of obesity and the link between obesity and health problems like Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The committee also recommended lowering the limit for alcoholic beverages for men to one drink per day from two, matching the guidance for women. It pointed to research linking greater alcohol consumption to a higher risk of death.<br />The new guidelines do include the scientific committee’s recommendation that children under age 2 consume no added sugars at all. This is the first time the guidelines have included recommendations for babies and toddlers. Added sugars are those found in processed foods—in everything from soda to breakfast cereal—as well as honey and sugar itself. They don’t include sugars naturally found in foods like fruit and milk.<br />The dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years, have a wide impact: They shape school lunch programs, mold state and local health-promotion efforts, and influence what food companies produce.<br />The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services reviewed the committee’s recommendations, which were released in July, and decided not to include the lower limits because “the new evidence is not substantial enough to support changes to quantitative recommendations for either added sugars or alcohol,” said Brandon Lipps, deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at the USDA. Mr. Lipps said that the new limits recommended by the scientific committee didn’t meet a “preponderance of the evidence” standard required by law.</td>

The genius of capitalism is that it harnesses human greed to the common good—but greed itself remains a sin. We are reminded of this every time a company uses foreign slave labor to bring down prices or calculates that the lawsuits arising from a safety glitch will cost it less than fixing the danger before anyone gets hurt. It may be good business, but it’s bad living.<br />Capitalism is a boon to humanity, but Marley was right: Mankind remains our business as well, and fairness, honesty and generosity should govern the heart even in the pursuit of profits.<br />It’s a fallen world. No system will fix it. Socialism errs in thinking it can force sinful humans to be what they are not. Capitalism errs in thinking that putting sin to good use will transform it into virtue.

      <td>Chunky clogs have become improbably trendy, with brands like Chanel, Hermès and Louis Vuitton offering high-fashion takes. Here, the footwear’s surprising history, from Dutch workers’ shoes to the Paris runways.</td>
      <td>ON HER FIRST date with Joe Biden, in 1975, Jill Biden, then a college student at the University of Delaware, immediately noticed his shoes. As she later recounted, “I had been dating guys in jeans and clogs and T-shirts, he came to the door and he had a sport coat and loafers and I thought, ‘God, this is never going to work, not in a million years.’”<br />As the incoming first lady observed, the divide between the clogged and the unclogged can seem vast. On the one side, bohemian aplomb; on the other, an uptight suspicion of any shoe that shares an etymology with plumbing mishaps. But reader, she married him. Is the gap really as yawning as we assume it to be?<br />It’s certainly narrowing, especially now that both mass-market and luxury brands are bringing new designs to eager consumers. In September,  Crocs  released a collaboration with the Puerto Rican rap star Bad Bunny that sold out in 16 minutes. And this season, Hermès, which is better known for handbags with yearslong waiting lists, is releasing its anticipated iteration; priced at $990, it’s in the new category of luxury clog. The Hermès design comes on the heels of  Louis Vuitton ,  Gucci, Dior and Chanel versions, not to mention more affordable offerings from Everlane and Gap, all of which are late to the party compared with No. 6, the New York brand whose earthy pairs made wood-soled shoes a fashionable class signifier 15 years ago.<br />This clog blossoming suggests not just a high-fashion takeover of a shoe formerly associated with artisans and hippies, but its newly broad appeal.<br />As with everything this year, the growing visibility of clogs has been shaped by the pandemic. With less of a reason to wear formal shoes, either because of unemployment or closed offices, clogs’ slip-on, slip-off ease is understandably appealing. And perhaps because their comfort and support makes them a favorite of health care workers, 2020’s superheroes, they’ve taken on an associative feel-good glow.</td>

In arguing for an end to lockdowns once vulnerable populations have been vaccinated, their analysis assumes that there is a binary outcome from Covid-19 infections: Either it kills you or it’s no threat at all.<br />Follow-up studies, however, have demonstrated that long-term cognitive and behavioral problems are common, affecting up to 20% of hospitalized survivors and up to 10% of patients with a much milder disease. There are a significant number of Covid patients who are left with chronic respiratory problems, chronic anosmia and cardiac sequela, and these problems aren’t limited to the elderly. The rest of the population is also at risk and must be protected, even if immediate death isn’t likely.<br />Most Americans would love to see the end of our public-health measures, but this is far too soon.

Does the need to shut down discussion, out of fear or plain rage, have its roots in genetic or environmental factors? We should study that, too.<br />Tom O’Hare<br />Charlestown, R.I.<br /><br />Mr. Riley quotes Flynn’s remark: “To advise scholars that they should not systemically investigate race and IQ seems to me to raise the question of what we are afraid of.” The Trump era has provided a bit of clarity on how one might begin to answer that. We aren’t afraid of the evidence or the truth about racial differences. We are afraid of individuals who wield great power and demonstrate little appreciation of the finer points. Do we need to go public with findings that we know will be used to substantiate distorted conclusions?</td>

That would mark its second straight monthly decline bigger than 14% and largest monthly drop since January. Prices are more than 25% below a peak hit in late October and have suffered four daily drops of at least 6% this month, a period of outsize volatility punctuated by Monday’s 8.5% slide and Tuesday’s recovery.<br />Natural-gas prices often gyrate in the winter because demand in the season is driven by how frequently people use their heaters. The power-generation fuel is used as the primary source of heat for roughly half of the homes in the U.S., so speculative investors often position for demand and prices to rally in the colder months of the year.<br />Recent weather forecasts show warmer temperatures spreading across the U.S. in the next few weeks, though, driving an unwind of bullish bets and fresh price declines.<br />“It is becoming increasingly apparent that the market will need to gradually discount another warmer-than-normal winter,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.</td>

And how do my beliefs compare with the widening spectrum of beliefs about America?<br />Many populist conservatives believe that America was at its best in the 1950s, when men were men and women were women, manufacturing dominated the economy, white Christians dominated the culture, patriotism was unquestioned, and divisive social issues hadn’t entered the public agenda.<br />I believe in America the way liberals do—not as perfect, but capable of being made “more perfect.” I believe in America the way Abraham Lincoln did at Gettysburg when he promised a new birth of freedom built on the foundation of the Declaration of Independence. I believe in America the way Martin Luther King Jr. did when he rooted his dream in the American dream and denominated the unpaid promissory note to black Americans in the principles of the declaration. I believe in America the way that Bill Clinton did when he declared in his 1993 inaugural address, “There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.”<br />There are those who don’t believe that America ever was, or ever can be, worthy of devotion. On the far left, some argue that America is irredeemably marked by slavery, conquest and genocide. They are right that we should seek to understand and to teach history fully, without glossing over its brutalities. But it is one thing to be honest about the past, another to use it as proof of a national original sin that can never be expunged. At the end of this road is despair—or revolution.<br />On the far right there are those who give America’s original sin a different name—liberalism. They claim that the Declaration of Independence inspired by John Locke has led us down the primrose path. A polity based on individual rights liberates appetites and destroys morality, they say, and the civil law created to protect liberty becomes the source of its destruction. At the end of this road lies theocracy, which could only be achieved at the point of the sword, or withdrawal into faith communities whose existence is protected by the polity their members scorn.</td>

Optimism about the world economy at the beginning of 2020 had a barrel of Brent crude at $70. Then came a pandemic that was in almost no company’s—or country’s—emergency plans. The general view of something called SARS-CoV-2 was initially conditioned by the experience of SARS-1 in the early 2000s, which had about 8,000 cases world-wide and fewer than 800 deaths.<br />But by March the highly transmissible coronavirus was precipitating a world-wide shutdown, the worst global recession in 74 years, and the constriction of movement by both car and plane. That led to a plummeting of global oil demand and a price collapse that saw prices go “negative,” or below zero, as producers paid people to take their oil away because storage tanks were filled to overflowing.<br />The rebound from negative prices and the stabilization of the market was made possible by unprecedented production cuts by the group that calls itself OPEC-plus—the 13 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and a group of 10 other producing nations led by Russia. That U.S.-brokered agreement got oil prices up into the $40 to $50 range of Virus Alley, blocked at one end by the virus and at the other by the uncertain prospect for vaccines. Now that vaccines are here, prices have moved to the $50 end of the alley. But will they rise into that higher band of $50 to $65 that will enable companies to start spending and attract investors?<br />In the short term, such a rebound will be challenged. The resurgence of the virus is again leading to shutdowns, reducing economic activities. A clear indication of this was provided by the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., when  IHS Markit ’s  weekly survey showed that gasoline demand had fallen to a level last seen in 1997. But on the expectation of widespread vaccinations by the spring, IHS Markit estimates that global economic growth in 2021 will reach 4.5%. While this will cancel out the 4% decline of 2020, small business and other sectors will be left devastated.</td>

      <td>Activist hedge fund says it has taken significant stake in Intel, calls for changes to preserve U.S. edge in semiconductor industry</td>
      <td>Activist hedge fund Third Point LLC is urging  Intel Corp.  to consider strategic changes after a year in which the U.S. semiconductor giant suffered new product delays and lost its rank as America’s most valued chip company.<br />Third Point said in a letter Tuesday to Intel Chairman Omar Ishrak, “We suggest the board retain a reputable investment advisor to evaluate strategic alternatives, including whether Intel should remain an integrated device manufacturer and the potential divestment of certain failed acquisitions.”<br />Intel said it “welcomes input from all investors regarding enhanced shareholder value. In that spirit, we look forward to engaging with Third Point LLC on their ideas towards that goal.”<br />Intel, which both designs and builds its own chips, said this year that it would consider outsourcing the manufacturing of some of its most advanced chips. The company is expected to decide soon where it will make future generations of processors.<br />Third Point said Intel risks triggering broader implications for U.S. tech supremacy if it fails to act. “Without immediate change at Intel, we fear that America’s access to leading-edge semiconductor supply will erode, forcing the U.S. to rely more heavily on a geopolitically unstable East Asia to power everything from PCs to data centers to critical infrastructure and more,” the letter says.</td>

      <td>A New Jersey man is suing local authorities who he says wrongly arrested him based on a false facial-recognition match, in a case that risks further inflaming debate over the utility and accuracy of the fast-emerging technology.<br />The man, 33-year-old Nijeer Parks, spent more than a week in jail after police detained him in February 2019 on charges of shoplifting, assault and drug possession related to a Jan. 26 incident that year at a Hampton Inn hotel in Woodbridge, N.J., according to a complaint filed in New Jersey Superior Court.<br />The criminal case was dismissed in November 2019, according to a court official in Middlesex County, where Woodbridge is located. Mr. Parks is now seeking unspecified damages, according to the complaint, over allegations including false arrest, civil-rights violations and emotional distress.<br />The New Jersey state police, Woodbridge police and prosecutors in Middlesex County didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. New York state police officials, whom the Woodbridge police sent photographs for facial-recognition comparison, said their records showed they didn’t provide any leads in the case.<br />Police increasingly have adopted facial-recognition software into their crime-solving arsenal. Advocates say it is an effective new technology that has helped solve many cases, but the tools have drawn growing scrutiny in law enforcement in part because of the potential consequences of a false match.</td>

      <td>Lawmakers have called for an investigation into the tech giants’ contract, dubbed ‘Jedi Blue,’ which allegedly allowed for auction rigging</td>
      <td>State attorneys general said in a lawsuit earlier this month that a 2018 business agreement between two digital advertising giants,  Facebook Inc.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google, was an illegal price-fixing deal. Lawmakers are calling for further investigation. The companies say it was above board.<br />The Wall Street Journal viewed part of a recent unredacted draft version of the lawsuit, which elaborates on allegations in the redacted complaint filed in a Texas federal district court.<br />Ten Republican attorneys general, led by Texas’ Ken Paxton, say Google gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a ubiquitous tool for allocating advertising space across the web. This and other conduct by Google, they allege in the final lawsuit, harms competition and deprives “advertisers, publishers and consumers of improved quality, greater transparency, increased output and/or lower prices.”<br />Previously unreported details from the draft, including contract terms and company documents, shed light on the legal battle ahead and the relationship between two tech giants who have called each other competitors even as they hold an ever-widening share of the digital advertising market.<br />A Google spokeswoman declined to comment on specific terms of the deal. She said the states’ “complaint misrepresents this agreement, as it does many other aspects of our ad tech business. We look forward to making our case in court.”</td>

      <td>Flight from Miami to New York is aircraft’s first in U.S. since being grounded nearly two years ago following deadly crashes</td>
      <td>American Airlines Group Inc.  put passengers back on  Boeing Co. ’s 737 MAX for the first time in the U.S. since the aircraft was grounded nearly two years ago following two deadly crashes.<br />American Flight 718 departed Miami International Airport around 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday and landed at New York’s LaGuardia Airport at 1:10 p.m. American said the flight was mostly full and that airline President Robert Isom was among the passengers.<br />Daily round-trip flights between Miami and New York are the start of American’s plans to gradually return the MAX to service. An American spokeswoman said the airline has begun announcing aircraft types during boarding to make sure passengers are aware when they are flying on a MAX. American will also alert passengers if they are suddenly scheduled to fly on a MAX due to a schedule change, she said.<br />David Seymour, American’s chief operating officer, said gradually reintroducing the MAX would help build customer confidence and give passengers flexibility if they initially prefer to fly on other aircraft. He said in an interview earlier this month that American pilots and flight attendants are confident of the plane’s safety.<br />“We would have never brought the aircraft back if they were not comfortable,” he said.</td>

      <td>Vermont is a tough place to visit this winter, but if you don’t want to socialize, here’s where to quarantine cozily</td>
      <td>HIDING OUT in Vermont’s snowy Green Mountains presents some challenges during Covid-times—but that’s the allure. The state’s strict regulations, wide-open spaces and intelligent epidemic management have led to one of the country’s lowest rates of infection. A tough place to visit, Vermont requires all out-of-state travelers to quarantine for seven days if they have a negative Covid test or 14 days without one—either before they leave home or after arrival. The state also limits locals and visitors alike from gathering with people from other households. Lodgings and restaurants and even ski resorts, however, are open at limited capacity.<br />The obstacles have kept most visitors at home, but if you don’t mind quarantining and don’t want to socialize, Vermont can be your own private snow globe this winter. And if you’re a skier, 50% lower capacity on peak weekends on the mountains means 50% fewer people scraping off the powder. We recommend these three, extra-safe lodging strategies, all focused on southern Vermont counties with even lower Covid rates than the rest of the state. Strap on your snowshoes.<br />The owners of the Homestyle Hotel Inn + Restaurant in Ludlow recently took over a motel in an 1830s building across the street and turned it into the Main + Mountain Bar and Motel. The transformed hostelry’s second-floor accommodations feature cool hues of white and gray, with live-edge headboards and white subway tile.<br />Covid-safety bonus: The motel has contactless check-in and pickup from the bar downstairs, and every room’s doors and windows open to the outside. Best of all, this fall the owners closed the hotel part of their property across the street and turned its former guest rooms into private dining rooms for the Homestyle Restaurant.<br />Surroundings: The homey mill town of Ludlow has emerged as one of Southern Vermont’s best dining destinations, and is about a five-minute drive from the access road to Okemo Mountain.</td>

      <td>European Union member states formally backed last week’s trade deal between the U.K. and the EU setting out post-Brexit trade, security and economic ties.<br />The agreement, which will be signed by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU’s top two officials on Wednesday, will come into effect provisionally on Jan. 1, pending the European Parliament’s vote on the accord in early 2021. The U.K. Parliament is expected to approve the agreement on Wednesday.<br />Approval had been widely expected following the agreement announced between the two sides on Christmas Eve. Negotiations lasted through most of 2020.<br />Formal approval by U.K. lawmakers is likely to be a formality, given Mr. Johnson’s majority in the House of Commons and the expected support from most lawmakers from the main opposition Labour Party.<br />Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com</td>
