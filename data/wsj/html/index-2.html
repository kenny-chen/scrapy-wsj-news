It couldn’t be determined if the men have U.S. attorneys.<br />A fifth individual, Niloufar Bahadorifar, a California resident, was charged with providing financial services that supported the kidnapping scheme and conspiring to commit fraud, money laundering and sanctions violations, though she isn’t charged with the kidnapping plot.

      <td>At least 10 Republicans would need to join every Democrat for bipartisan pact to pass the Senate</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Republicans sounded fresh alarms about the financing of a roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, questioning whether its cost would be fully covered as lawmakers tried to iron out the final details of the bill.<br />Eleven Senate Republicans have joined 11 members of the Democratic caucus to endorse the infrastructure agreement, which is still under construction and aims to spend $579 billion above projected federal investment in roads, bridges and water projects.<br />But some of those Republicans said that the agreement’s plan to raise funds from enhanced enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service may still prove problematic, depending on the scope of the new authority given to the tax agency. Republicans have also raised concerns that the revenue measures, which also include public-private partnerships, may not ultimately cover the cost of the plan.<br />Those two issues could peel off Republican members of the group, which is set to meet Tuesday evening to work through the remaining questions, lawmakers said. In the 50-50 Senate, at least 10 Republicans would need to join every Democrat in support of the infrastructure agreement for it to pass.<br />“Where we’re really going to have challenges when we meet is on the payfors. The tax gap concerns me somewhat in terms of the impact you could have on businesses,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R., N.C.), one of the Republicans who had previously endorsed the infrastructure framework, said referencing enhanced IRS enforcement.</td>

      <td>A divided federal appeals court on Tuesday held that the federal government may not bar federally licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to law-abiding citizens under 21 years old, potentially setting up the issue for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide.<br />The 2-1 decision by the Richmond, Va-.based Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals marked the first time that such a high-level court so explicitly extended the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms to younger adults. The disagreement foreshadows a potential Supreme Court review.<br />“Despite the weighty interest in reducing crime and violence, we refuse to relegate either the Second Amendment or 18- to 20-year-olds to a second-class status,” wrote Circuit Judge Julius N. Richardson, who was appointed by former Republican President Donald Trump.<br />The plaintiffs were two adults under 21 from Albemarle County, Va., who were prevented from buying handguns from a licensed dealer, including a 19-year-old woman who wanted protection from an abusive ex-boyfriend.<br />In 2018, they filed suit challenging a federal law that limits federally licensed gun dealers from selling handguns and their ammunition to people under 21. Congress first enacted the restriction in the late 1960s, responding to a surge of violent crime committed by young people.</td>

      <td>Editor’s note: This Future View discusses the idea of the student-athlete in light of recent rule changes regarding their compensation. Next, we’ll ask, “What has your experience been with critical race theory during your college years or earlier?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before July 27. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Athlete-Students<br />The “student-athlete” was always more of an ideal than a reality. In my time in collegiate tennis at the University of Tennessee, it was a common saying that the name should be changed to “athlete-student.” We all knew where priorities truly lay. Any current or former student-athlete could quickly tell you how compliance with NCAA limits on practice and training hours is rare, while enforcement of restrictions on benefits is utterly disproportionate. But it’s not only the NCAA and athletic departments; many student-athletes view their collegiate sports experience as a necessary stepping-stone to a professional career, with academics as an afterthought or even an obstacle.<br />Many schools and athletic programs, especially the non-revenue-generating ones, continue to respect the student-athlete ideal as something at which to aim. The upper echelons of collegiate sports, however, have long stopped trying, and the trend toward some form of compensation there will help align the rules with the reality. The student-athlete will continue to exist elsewhere, in some form, but don’t kid yourself into thinking the ideal can ever coexist with record-breaking TV-rights deals.</td>

      <td>His escalating rhetoric is meant to justify the unjustifiable, H.R.1.</td>
      <td>The Democratic narrative on voting is becoming unglued. “The 21st-century Jim Crow assault is real,” President Biden claimed Tuesday. “We’re facing the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War—that’s not hyperbole,” he said in the same speech. “The Confederates back then never breached the Capitol, as insurrectionists did on January the 6th.”<br />As Mr. Biden apparently sees it, the latest Civil War is in Texas, where state lawmakers want to make voting “so hard and inconvenient that they hope people don’t vote at all.” On Monday more than 50 Democrats from the Texas House absconded to Washington, D.C., to deny their chamber a quorum. “I left because I am tired of sitting as a hostage,” one lawmaker told the awaiting press at Dulles airport, “while Republicans strip away the rights of my constituents to vote.”<br />This partisan rhetoric is detached from the facts. We’ve already gone through the misrepresentations of Georgia’s and Florida’s voting laws. What’s proposed in Texas? First, the bills would end two practices that Harris County pioneered last year amid the pandemic: drive-through voting and 24-hour voting. These options were used disproportionately by nonwhites. Perhaps they made sense when every Texan was urged to stay six feet from every other Texan.<br />But if the Legislature doesn’t want them to be permanent, then reverting to the pre-Covid status quo of 2019 is not some epochal loss for voting rights. Gov. Greg Abbott argues that drive-through voting breaks the traditional privacy of the polling booth. “Are you going to have people in the car with you?” he asked. “It could be somebody from your employer or somebody else who may have some coercive effect on the way that you would cast your ballot.”<br />As for 24-hour voting, it isn’t unreasonable to think polling-place mischief might be more likely at 3 a.m. Public confidence can be undermined by even false claims about what happened in the dead of night, including President Trump’s wild allegations about ballot “dumps.” The Texas bills would allow broad voting hours: 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. in the Senate version, or 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. in the House version.</td>

      <td>‘Transitory’ price increases are now up 5.4% year-over-year.</td>
      <td>How do you define transitory? Three months? A year? Or is it two? Inquiring minds want to know after Tuesday’s report that the consumer price index rose 0.9% in June. Consumer prices are now up 5.4% from a year earlier, so what the Federal Reserve means when it dismisses these price increases as “transitory” takes on growing economic and political significance.<br />The June increase was nearly twice what economic forecasters predicted, which isn’t reassuring. The inflation optimists are dismissing the June increase as the result of “special” factors that are likely to ease. Used car and truck prices rose 10.5% in the month, accounting for about half the increase in core CPI. No doubt vehicle prices won’t keep rising at that rate, but then that’s also what we were told when they rose 10% in April. This won’t reassure the non-affluent Americans who buy used cars.<br />Price increases were widespread across the economy, which suggests factors that may not be transitory. Food prices rose 0.8%, and energy prices 1.5% in the month. The Fed likes to strip out food and energy prices, which are volatile, to examine core inflation. But the core increase was also 0.9% in June.<br />Year-over-year core prices are up 4.5%, which is less than for all consumer prices, but is still well above the Fed’s target of 2% a year. The last time core prices rose 4.5% in a 12-month period was 1991 and the Fed’s benchmark short-term interest rate was above 5%. Today it’s near zero.<br />These price jolts aren’t likely to stir Fed Chairman Jerome Powell when he testifies on Capitol Hill this week. That’s because Mr. Powell is getting the inflation he wanted. The Fed’s new policy, which it unveiled last year, says that to achieve its 2% inflation target it is willing to tolerate inflation above that for some time. Congratulations, you’ve got it.</td>

      <td>A diplomatic push for fair elections in December would serve U.S. interests.</td>
      <td>President Obama’s biggest regret, he told “Fox News Sunday” in 2016, was “failing to plan for the day after” the 2011 intervention in Libya, which toppled dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Joe Biden has a chance to make amends.<br />Largely forgotten by the U.S. and its allies, Libya has become a center of human trafficking and the source of a migrant crisis in Europe. It has suffered from a decade of civil strife and fractured leadership. Its oil reserves, Africa’s richest, are at risk of coming under Turkish and Russian control. The solution: free and fair elections and the removal of all foreign forces.<br />Libya effectively has two governments. Russia supports the eastern one, led by the Libyan National Army, the country’s only unified force, under the command of Gen. Khalifa Haftar. In the west, militias, some Islamist in character, fight among themselves when they aren’t fighting Gen. Haftar.<br />Turkey’s military, seeking to ensure access to the Mediterranean Sea for energy exploration, backs the western Islamist militias. In April, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Ankara and Libya’s western Government of National Accord were committed to a 2019 maritime demarcation in the eastern Mediterranean. The agreement directly threatens a January 2020 energy deal between Israel and Greece. The latter doesn’t want Mr. Erdogan to have further influence around its shores. An uneasy cease-fire has held in Libya since October, but both Turkey and Russia are reinforcing by building air and naval bases.<br />The U.S. has largely stayed out of Libyan affairs since the 2012 Benghazi debacle. But Washington can take responsibility by insisting on free and fair elections. “We’d like the U.S. to remove all foreign forces in Libya, and we hope the U.S. will pressure all groups in Libya to make sure the elections in December will take place,” says Abdulhadi Soliman, spokesman for the Fezzan Libya Organization, a nonprofit based in the southwestern part of the country.</td>

      <td>The split bill is good for him. It complicates life and minimizes losses for congressional Democrats.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s insistence on splitting his infrastructure package into two bills—one bipartisan, the second to be passed along party lines—is good for him but will make life complicated for congressional Democrats. Mr. Biden can get credit for trying to enact his party’s most extreme positions, while not paying the price for succeeding politically as Barack Obama did in 2010.<br />Conservatives shouldn’t rejoice about the policy implications. By using executive action, Mr. Biden will go further left than any predecessor, but not as far as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders demand. But when it comes to legislation, the partisan “budget reconciliation” process will force Senate Democrats to blame each other, not Mr. Biden or irrelevant Republicans. Moderates like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema will save the president from his party’s excesses and absorb progressive ire for his failure to deliver.<br />Mr. Biden will happily defend civility, bipartisanship, “pay fors” and other process arguments unlikely to excite anyone outside Washington, rather than referee internal Democratic policy fights. His insistence on passing the first infrastructure bill with 10 Republican votes to overcome the Senate filibuster keeps more-radical policies out of the bill and focuses spending on hard infrastructure like roads and ports, which is popular with voters. Mr. Biden will still get enough green spending to appease center-left voters, but he’ll employ a rope-a-dope strategy with Mr. Sanders’s followers, allowing them to expend their energy pushing congressional Democrats while he offers mild and vague encouragement.<br />The stakes are high for 2022 because the margins are so narrow. Speaker Nancy Pelosi can lose only four seats and maintain her majority, yet seven House Democrats represent districts Donald Trump won. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s margin is a single senator.<br />Republicans have faced narrow majorities and internal divisions before. Tea-party activists were often less angry at Democrats for passing ObamaCare than at Speaker John Boehner and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell for failing to get rid of it; they grudgingly respected Democrats for using whatever means necessary to accomplish their liberal goals. Sen. Ted Cruz became a hero to many by encouraging the House to use the appropriations process to defund ObamaCare, a fight that angered leadership and led to a government shutdown. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives will be similarly motivated to fight with their fellow Democrats.</td>

      <td>The latest bill would outlaw ‘detestation’ but not humiliation.</td>
      <td>Toronto<br />Canada believes in free speech, but not the way the U.S. does. The U.S. Supreme Court held “hate speech” laws unconstitutional in R.A.V. v. St. Paul (1992), but its Canadian counterpart reached the opposite conclusion two years earlier. Hate speech can be a crime or a civil offense here, and these laws have led to long, costly battles involving columnist Mark Steyn, political activist Ezra Levant and several pastors in Western Canada.<br />Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wants tighter restrictions. In May he introduced Bill C-10, which would put internet speech under the jurisdiction of the broadcast regulator, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. Opposition parties on both the right and left pushed back, but Mr. Trudeau, who leads a minority government, adjusted the bill to win support from the leftist New Democrats and Greens. The House of Commons passed the bill, but the Senate decided in June not to hold any summer committee meetings, putting Bill C-10 on ice at least until fall.<br />On June 23, however, Mr. Trudeau’s government introduced Bill C-36, which would amend the Criminal Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act by toughening provisions against online hate speech. The bill illustrates the difficulties in establishing such an offense. It would define hate speech as “communication that expresses detestation or vilification of an individual or group of individuals on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.”<br />But then comes a putative clarification: “For greater certainty, the content of a communication does not express detestation or vilification . . . solely because it expresses mere dislike or disdain or it discredits, humiliates, hurts or offends.” By what objective standard could a court or a human-rights tribunal distinguish between “detestation” and mere humiliation?</td>

      <td>No company has dominated national commerce as much as the Tata Group in India. Yet it has been family-run for most of its existence.</td>
      <td>Drive on any highway in India—which you’d do only if your craving for risk matched your appetite for hot naan—and chances are that a perilously laden truck will hurtle past you with the words “OK Tata” painted on its rear fenders. In this signature slogan of the country’s roads, the second word is a pun playing on the way Indians say goodbye to each other as well as on the name of the venerable business group that made the truck.<br />The story of this Indian company turns out to be about much more than heavy-goods vehicles. Founded in 1868, the Tata Group has been at “the top of the corporate pyramid” in India for the better part of a century, Mircea Raianu writes, the closest business enterprise to function as a “state within a state” in that country since the founding of the East India Co. (the aggressively mercenary forerunner of the British Raj). Mr. Raianu, a historian at the University of Maryland, is guilty of no hype when he titles his book “Tata: The Global Corporation That Built Indian Capitalism.”<br />Americans are most likely to know the Indian conglomerate through its Tata Consultancy Services, a global behemoth with market capitalization of roughly $160 billion. At the turn of the present century, TCS offered low-cost data-processing services to Western companies, “giving rise,” Mr. Raianu tells us, “to the ‘off-shoring’ model that would come to dominate” the information-technology services industry. Think of those calls in which you’re talking to an “Ethan” or “Amy,” their Indian accents (almost) masked by rigorous training in American speech patterns.<br />No other company has dominated the history of its national commerce and industry quite as much as the house of Tata in India, where it is one of the few major businesses still regarded as unstained by overt corruption. Although family-run for most of its existence—the stubborn Indian norm for merchants—the Tata company was from an early date “unusual” among India’s corporate groups (Mr. Raianu says) in employing professional executives and “talented nonrelatives.” The company also “kept its distance from the state” in both colonial and postcolonial times. It gave only lukewarm support to the Indian National Congress, which meant that the Tatas had few political chips to cash when the Congress party came to govern a free India. It paid a harsh price for this aloofness when Air India—the Tatas’ thriving aviation arm—was nationalized by Prime Minister Nehru in 1953.<br />The irony is that the Tatas were somewhat anticolonial in their British-era operations, pursuing access to American expertise and technology as a means, Mr. Raianu says, “of countering British domination.” From World War I to the Great Depression, the American connection allowed the Tatas to “circumvent restrictive colonial state policies” designed to favor British-owned over Indian businesses. In turn, Tata served as America’s best friend in India and a conduit for American influence. This warmth was to recede, of course, as the socialist Nehru and his successors embraced the Soviet Union in the years of the Cold War.</td>

      <td>A majority of American fourth- and eighth-graders can’t read or do math at grade level, according to the Education Department. And that assessment is from 2019, before the learning losses from pandemic school closures.<br />Whenever someone asks me about critical race theory, that statistic comes to mind. What’s the priority, teaching math and reading, or turning elementary schools into social-justice boot camps?<br />Given that black and Hispanic students are more likely to be lagging academically, it’s a question that anyone professing to care deeply about social inequality might consider. Learning gaps manifest themselves in all kinds of ways later in life, from unemployment rates and income levels to the likelihood of teenage pregnancy, substance abuse and involvement with the criminal-justice system. Our jails and prisons already have too many woke illiterates.<br />Wealthier parents will make sure their kids receive a decent education, even if it means using private schools or hiring tutors. But the majority of children are relegated to the traditional public-school system, where progressives now want to prioritize the teaching of critical race theory. In addition to being a horrible idea, the timing couldn’t be worse. As the country rapidly diversifies—for more than a decade, U.S. population growth has been driven primarily by Asians and Hispanics—liberals want to teach children to obsess over racial and ethnic differences. What could go wrong?<br />Recently, the nation’s two largest teachers’ unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, announced that they had jumped on the bandwagon. At its annual meeting earlier this month, the NEA adopted a proposal stating that it is “reasonable and appropriate for curriculum to be informed by academic frameworks for understanding and interpreting the impact of the past on current society, including critical race theory.” More, the organization pledged to “fight back against anti-CRT rhetoric” and issue a study that “critiques empire, white supremacy, anti-Blackness, anti-Indigeneity, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society.” There was no proposal vowing to improve math and reading test scores, alas.</td>

      <td>Art market roars back as crypto-collectors and millennials in Asia drive sales on everything from NFTs to blue-chip art</td>
      <td>After a turbulent year, Christie’s said Tuesday that millennials in Asia and cryptocurrency collectors are splurging on blue-chip art, bidding up everything from jewelry to Jean-Michel Basquiat.<br />Christie’s sold $3.5 billion of art during the first half of the year, up 75% from the first seven months last year when the pandemic upended its entire calendar and compelled the London-based house to delay its marquee May series to midsummer.<br />“We’re seeing a very strong rebound,” said Chief Executive Guillaume Cerutti, adding that 87% of its offerings found buyers during the first half of the year.<br />The total includes $2.7 billion in art sold online and during live-streamed auctions as well as $850 million in privately brokered art sales. The house also appears close to recapturing its pre-pandemic momentum, with its latest auction total falling just shy of the $2.8 billion in art it auctioned off during the first half of 2019. Private sales have already surpassed pre-pandemic levels, the house said.<br />Rival Sotheby’s declined to comment on its sales, but a recent report from auction research firm ArtTactic said it found the house had auctioned roughly $2.8 billion in art during the first half. Phillips said it would release its sales figures later this month. The same ArtTactic report estimated the boutique auctioneer auctioned off around $425 million in art.</td>

      <td>WILMINGTON, Del.—Elon Musk said Tesla bought SolarCity Corp. for one fundamental reason: to become more than a car company.<br />The Tesla Inc. chief executive made the argument as he wrapped up two days of sometimes feisty testimony in court, defending the roughly $2.1 billion tie-up completed in 2016 at a time both Tesla and SolarCity were financially struggling.<br />Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights III, the presiding judge in a shareholder lawsuit, drilled into that deal logic at the end of Mr. Musk’s testimony. “Tesla was facing headwinds, had its own issues,” the judge said. “And so why is it at this moment that Tesla is pursuing this acquisition of a solar company?”<br />“The goal is not to be a car company. There are plenty of car companies,” Mr. Musk responded. “But an electric car company is part of a sustainable energy future, as is solar and stationary storage.”<br />A group of shareholders is alleging that Mr. Musk controlled the takeover while having a financial interest in both companies, that many of its directors were conflicted and that Tesla overpaid for SolarCity. Mr. Musk has said he didn’t dictate the deal process or price and recused himself from the shareholder vote.</td>

      <td>Karen Gillan, Angela Bassett, Lena Headey, Carla Gugino and Michelle Yeoh star in Navot Papushado’s supercharged reimagining of the crime film genre involving a group of female contract killers.</td>
      <td>Back in 2013, the director Quentin Tarantino declared the horror-thriller “Big Bad Wolves” the best film of the year. It may well have been true. But the American director’s affinity for the Israeli feature was no surprise—it was, after all, Tarantino-esque: violent but cinematic, socially conscious without sermonizing, irreverent, audacious and a toppler of movie tradition. With their award-winning “Wolves,” Navot Papushado and his directing partner, Aharon Keshales, made the Israeli movie industry safe for something it had never seen before, genre films.<br />“Gunpowder Milkshake”—such a great title—finds Mr. Papushado directing on his own this time (from a screenplay by himself and Ehud Lavski) and operating in the world of unstoppable contract killers, female division. But he continues to push boundaries, propelling the increasingly moribund crime film into a pastel-hued world of eye-popping artifice and hyperviolence. The effect, at times, is abstract expressionist, the choreography and camera moves creating their own context—one that takes flight from the narrative and occupies a universe of color and movement that transcends the copious bloodshed being served up, hot and cold.<br />Not everyone’s cup of mayhem, assuredly. As compensation for the busy visuals, the storyline will be a comfortable one, especially to fans of “La Femme Nikita,” “Léon: The Professional,” “Gloria” and any number of large-caliber ancestors. The attitude is decidedly tongue-in-cheek. The tone of the acting is so heightened it’s a shock no one gets a nosebleed.<br />Sam (Karen Gillan), a seemingly invincible hitwoman working for an outfit called The Firm, hasn’t seen her mother, Scarlet (Lena Headey), in 15 years: Scarlet pulled the trigger on the wrong person, it seems, and had to skedaddle, but not before helping train Sam in the martial, ballistic and paramilitary arts. Sam, understandably, has issues of the maternal variety: When she’s dispatched by her handler, Nathan (Paul Giamatti), to settle accounts with The Firm’s accountant—he has absconded with a considerable sack of cash and securities—she finds that the alleged embezzler was only trying to ransom back his daughter, who’d been kidnapped by a gang in horror-movie masks. Defying orders, Sam insists on not just getting the money back but rescuing the imperiled young Emily (Chloe Coleman)—and she doesn’t even have to kill the kidnappers: They’re so eager to betray each other they all wind up dead. But they also blow up the money. Which prompts The Firm to withdraw its protection of Sam, leaving her the target of all kinds of people with all kinds of vendettas.<br />“Gunpowder Milkshake” would be a pretty obvious feminist parable even without the trio of “librarians” who comfort Sam with advice and artillery. Carla Gugino is the dainty but lethal Madeleine; Michelle Yeoh is the quietly deadly Florence; Angela Bassett is the snarling Anna May, who is angry with Sam for never stopping by their bookish armory, where the volumes contain handguns of various sizes and the larger-caliber weapons have monikers like “Jane Austen,” “Virginia Woolf” and “Charlotte Bronte.” All three actresses have impressive action-movie credentials (Ms. Gugino in the “Spy Kids” films, Ms. Yeoh in “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” Ms. Bassett in “Black Panther,” to cite just a few examples) but they have seldom left behind quite this number of casualties. Mr. Papushado requires them to thump a virtual army of male perpetrators, something they do with considerable style.</td>

      <td>Two groups hailing from Lubbock, Texas—one an American classic and the other an up-and-coming regional favorite—release records that pay tribute to their country roots.</td>
      <td>A longstanding source of amusement among Texas music aficionados is the title chosen for a posthumous collection of country-tinged Buddy Holly recordings—“Holly in the Hills.” Anyone even remotely familiar with the territory around his native Lubbock, where those recordings were made, a decade earlier, knows there are no green Appalachian-style hills in sight, the area being famously arid and flat.<br />It’s regularly assumed that that vast, unvarying West Texas landscape produces remote, laconic musical loners, but in practice the territory has been home to a series of gregarious and verbally effusive outfits, from Holly’s day to our own. Two new albums from Lubbock-born bands—the genuinely iconic Americana veterans the Flatlanders, and the relatively young but practiced Flatland Cavalry—illustrate the point while heralding the geography.<br />The Flatlanders, singer-songwriters Joe Ely, Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Butch Hancock, have all had notable and distinct individual careers since they first joined forces in 1972, and after, they belatedly won recognition as a group in the 1990s. Mr. Ely is a rocker and honky-tonker as leathery as Johnny Cash; Mr. Gilmore, a sweet-voiced, spiritually inclined folk and country artist; Mr. Hancock, a more literary, rasp-voiced ironist. Yet their strong camaraderie and shared sensibility is unmistakable and has lasted nearly five decades.<br />Out now is their first new Flatlanders album in a dozen years, “Treasure of Love” (Rack’em Records/Thirty Tigers), built on the simpatico sorts of songs from classic country, blues, roots rock, folk and literary singer-songwriter genres—categories they have melded and which have defined the band from the first. Eleven are favorite numbers they have recorded but never spruced up for release until the Covid-19 break, and there four new originals.<br />From the deep country catalog come the honky-tonk title track, an early George Jones song delivered with prominent pedal steel by their buddy and album co-producer Lloyd Maines; Mr. Ely’s acoustic take on Ernest Tubb’s 1940s confessional “I Don’t Blame You”; and a jaunty version of Tex Ritter’s “Long Time Gone,” the trio working close harmonies similar to those used in the Everly Brothers’ version. There are charming Gilmore-sung versions of Leon Russell’s “She Smiles Like a River” and Bob Dylan’s “She Belongs to Me.” And fellow Texas songwriters are represented by Hancock takes on Townes Van Zandt’s moody “Snowin’ on Raton” and Mickey Newberry’s more comical “Mobile Blues.” The distinctive, frisky Hancock style is also central in his three originals, which include “Mama Does the Kangaroo.” (It’s a dance.)</td>

Following the report, Jim Goodnight and John Sall, who co-founded SAS decades ago and still run the company, had a change of heart and decided not to sell to Broadcom, the people said. Whether another suitor for SAS could emerge isn’t clear.<br />Some SAS employees saw the company as a strange fit for efficiency-focused Broadcom, some of the people familiar with the matter said. SAS is known for a tightknit culture and has a sprawling North Carolina campus with amenities including a yoga studio and a disc golf course.<br />Cary, N.C.-based SAS sells analytics-, business-intelligence and data-management software to enterprises. The company traces its roots back to the 1960s, when universities teamed up to analyze troves of agricultural data through a program called the Statistical Analysis System.<br />Broadcom, a semiconductor powerhouse built largely through acquisitions, has been on the hunt for a deal to beef up its presence in the corporate-software market. Its chief executive, Hock Tan, said earlier this year the company would look at buybacks and possibly debt repayment, if it didn’t make an acquisition by the end of the fiscal year. That typically ends in late October or early November.</td>

He also criticized Republicans who oppose Democratic-sponsored voting legislation in the Senate.<br />“Hear me clearly: There’s an unfolding assault taking place in America today—an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote and fair and free elections,” Mr. Biden said. “An assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are as Americans.”<br />“We’ve got to act,” Mr. Biden said as he ended his speech at the National Constitution Center, knocking his fist against the podium.<br />Voting issues have become a top priority in both parties this year. Republicans say the changes they have pushed in states such as Georgia and Texas, which include new limits on mail ballots and more identification requirements for voters requesting a mail ballot, are aimed at improving election security. They also say the federal government shouldn’t interfere with voting rules set by states.</td>

On 17 of the past 18 days, the seven-day case average was higher than the 14-day average, also suggesting cases have been rising nationally.<br />The uptick follows a significant slowdown in Covid-19 metrics after a deadly winter surge, when newly reported cases peaked at around 240,000 cases a day in mid-January, and it comes as public-health officials push to reinvigorate the nation’s vaccination campaign and get shots to undecided or isolated Americans. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly all recent Covid-19 cases and deaths from the disease are among unvaccinated people.<br />In Los Angeles County, the country’s most populous, new cases recently exceeded 1,000 for three consecutive days, the first time in months it has done so, according to data from the county’s Department of Public Health.<br />Health officials there said transmission of Covid-19 is increasing among younger, unvaccinated individuals. Of the 1,094 new cases reported on Saturday, 83% were under age 50, according to the public-health department. The department also blamed the spread on increased interaction, summer socialization and new variants of concern, like Delta, which was first detected in India.</td>

      <td><br /><br />The human-shark dynamic defines dysfunctional. We sometimes eat them; they sometimes eat us. We probably scare them; they definitely scare us. But both creatures are capable of making bad romantic choices if you go by “MechaShark,” which shows just how much love can hurt, especially below the surface.<br />Presented as part of Discovery’s annual “Shark Week”—which began Sunday and has been presenting the finest in shark programming since 1988—“MechaShark” opens a watery window into the mating rituals and mechanics of great whites. It is an area about which very little is known, according to coral-reef ecologist Marc Erdmann, who, with shark researcher Kina Scollay and vehicle designer Alister Baxter, travels to New Zealand’s Foveaux Strait, which is suspected of being the elusive mating ground of great whites. Why that spot? Because the team, a year earlier, spotted a number of sharks with fresh wounds. And knowing what they do know about sharkish courtship, they suspect love is in the air. Or at least under the water.<br />There is a considerable amount of pulsating music and editing that buoys a general tenor of terror in “MechaShark.” We sometimes have to rely on the observations and the awed reactions of the show’s hosts regarding the size and proximity of certain of the fish, because everything is visually relative and we don’t always have a reference point—except for MechaShark itself. The title “character” is actually a jet-propelled, shark-shaped cage designed and built by Mr. Baxter (who has done design work on several Hollywood movies) and in which Mr. Scollay ventures beneath the surface in the hope of observing shark mating.</td>

The request seemed appropriate for a grand, 6-bedroom, 8 bathroom home a stone’s throw from the swank Beverly Hills Hotel.<br />The family room had good bones—a 10-foot coffered ceiling (which Mr. Saghian said gives the space a “more upscale look”), french doors that opened onto a covered patio and a natural stone fireplace—so no major renovations were required. But the interior designer, who founded his eponymous Los Angeles-based firm five years ago and has said he’s inspired by “the opulence and glamour of Old Hollywood,” was challenged with balancing the client’s stylistic desires with more practical considerations in the room where they spend most of their time.<br />“They have a dog and three kids who are high school and college age. They have friends over all the time, they eat here and do homework here.”<br />For high-use pieces, like the large sectional, Mr. Saghian chose performance fabrics that can withstand a plethora of stains and be easily cleaned. “It is now much easier to create a beautiful, high-style room that is also durable,” he noted of the result, adding. “I do think, in the end, that it’s very glamorous.”</td>

      <td>An HBO Max reunion special features not only Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer but David Beckham, Malala and more.</td>
      <td>‘It’s about that time in your life when your friends are your family,” producer David Crane recalls during the unabashedly sentimental “Friends: The Reunion,” describing the “one-sentence pitch” that he and co-creator Marta Kauffman devised for their famously popular sitcom, birthed on Sept. 22, 1994. If you were living through that particular time of your life during the 10-year run of “Friends,” the show might hold the same place in your heart that the Beatles do for Boomers.<br />If you ever wanted to hear Lady Gaga’s version of “Smelly Cat” replete with gospel chorus, then “Friends: The Reunion” is certainly the show for you. And if you don’t know exactly what that means, it will still entertain. The show’s principal cast—Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, Courteney Cox, Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer—all seem very happy to be here, though Mr. Perry seems a bit more downcast than the others. Mr. LeBlanc is the most witty, charming and relaxed returnee; the rest seem virtually unchanged, though not unmoved by the circumstances.<br />Along with clips, quips and bloopers, the show features a virtual parade of familiar faces as well as total unknowns from around the globe all testifying as to how important the program was to them. As far as can be determined, neither soccer legend David Beckham nor Nobel laureate Malala was ever on “Friends,” but they’re big fans and so they are here. That Malala would have been about 7 when the “Friends” finale aired on May 6, 2004, is a testament to how the show has never really gone away and seemingly never will: The old episodes have time-traveled though reruns, VHS tapes, DVD boxed sets and their current iteration as streaming content on HBO Max—something of which this special serves as a not-uncalculated reminder.<br />The inescapable James Corden, impersonating an interviewer, poses questions of the how-does-it feel/tell-us-about-it school of journalistic inquiry during the onstage portion of the show. The awkwardness can be painful. “Do you stay in touch?” he asks, with Ms. Kudrow offering a diplomatic “not every day” and Mr. Perry muttering, “I don’t hear from anyone.” You’re not sure he’s kidding.<br />Most of the time, Mr. Corden’s role is head cheerleader, waxing adorational and introducing notables in the audience, including Mr. Crane, Ms. Kauffman and executive producer Kevin S. Bright, who provide a lot of interesting background on the creation of the show, notably the struggle to cast it. A number of the guests are “surprises,” though longtime “Friends” watchers would have been more surprised if these individuals didn’t show up. The absence of certain other folk will likely raise hackles among the fan base.</td>

That policy, if maintained in Florida, would result in the company being fined up to $5,000 for each passenger affected, it said.<br />The Miami-based company filed the lawsuit Tuesday against Scott Rivkees, the state surgeon general, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Norwegian asked the court to block and declare unlawful the enforcement of the ban on requiring proof of vaccination. Norwegian only sued Dr. Rivkees because he is the state official who has authority to enforce the ban, according to the company’s complaint.<br />Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in May said, “Your personal choice regarding vaccinations will be protected, and no business or government entity will be able to deny you services based on your decision.”<br />The Florida Department of Health didn’t respond to a request for comment.</td>

      <td>Unrest triggered by the arrest of former President Jacob Zuma risks worsening the surge in coronavirus infections, causing food insecurity</td>
      <td>JOHANNESBURG—Violence and looting in parts of South Africa, triggered by the arrest of former President Jacob Zuma, are broadening to reflect more deep-seated problems in the continent’s most developed economy, where a third pandemic lockdown is exacerbating economic pain and joblessness that has disproportionately affected the poor.<br />Police, now bolstered by a small deployment of soldiers, struggled for a third day to contain crowds ransacking warehouses and shopping centers in the economic capital of Johannesburg and the port city of Durban. In hospitals, doctors already stretched by a record wave of Covid-19 infections had trouble caring for the injured, with many nurses and other staff unable to come to work because of roadblocks and the broader insecurity, officials said.<br />The country’s police ministry warned that the continued blockage of some of South Africa’s main transport routes could within days lead to shortages of food and other essentials and that mass gatherings could prompt a fresh rise in Covid-19 cases. At least 72 people have died amid the instability, officials said Tuesday, some trampled to death in shopping-center stampedes.<br />“People are tired and frustrated with the whole situation,” said Abram Lekganyane, who usually sells durags, sunglasses and masks at a stall at the Pan Africa Shopping Centre in the Johannesburg township of Alexandra. Mr. Lekganyane said he checked on his wares in a nearby storage facility and saw people leaving with everything from plasma televisions to sound systems and groceries.<br />“The spark may have been Zuma. Now it’s a revolution against the lockdown, because nothing is being provided,” he said.</td>

      <td>In an HBO drama, Kate Winslet stars as a small-town detective haunted by her tragic past and the unsolved disappearance of a local girl</td>
      <td>The title of this sterling drama set in a small Pennsylvania town is a clear sign of things to come. “Mare of Easttown” (begins Sunday, 10 p.m., HBO) is, namely, a seven-part series whose powers derive as much from its enthralling focus on that town and its society as from the unsteady life and career of its heroine, known simply as Mare, a police detective born and raised there.<br />Kate Winslet’s eloquent command of the role is obvious from the outset. Our first look at Mare shows her jarred awake from a deep sleep in the early morning by an elderly citizen who thinks she’s seen a prowler. But the detective isn’t upset, and she is patient with the woman. She’s at home in this world she’s known all her life. She’s also divorced, and her self-esteem hasn’t been advanced by learning that her former husband has found a new woman to make him happy and is about to marry her. Furthermore, her mind is on the job she holds and the torments that go with it. The case of a young woman from Easttown who has been missing for a year haunts her, and it doesn’t help that the girl’s anguished mother has taken to public denunciations of the police department and particularly Mare for their failure to find her. There is, in addition, the weight of the past, which includes never-ending thoughts about Mare’s son, who took his own life.<br />For all that, she has a life of her own—one she shares with her entertainingly dour mother, Helen (a delectable Jean Smart); her teenage daughter, Siobhan (Angourie Rice); and not least with her beloved 4-year-old grandson, child of the son who took his own life. She has a circle of friends, including the sister of one of the criminals she chased down. She’s the kind of detective who threatens the utility company with action if it doesn’t turn the heat back on in the freezing houses of people she’s come to know in her line of work.<br />For all the worries that pursue her, the memories that haunt her, she manages to live that life with gusto. In this she’s like everyone else in Easttown, a world of people with troubles. The atmosphere of crisis is pervasive—people suffer, they drink, they rant—and it’s a testament to the writing (Brad Ingelsby wrote the script) that no moment in this saga ever feels even remotely unreal. The first episode alone delivers a generous taste of the bottomless rage that comes spewing forth from new husbands, furious that they have to foot expenses for children who have come with the marriage—even things like diapers. Or, as in the case of a father who has found a new love life, outrage at being confronted by the mother of his child seeking help from him to pay for his son’s necessary ear operation. The battling isn’t always about money, either. Among the younger set, text messaging a former boyfriend can, if it falls into the wrong hands—i.e., the ex-boyfriend’s new partner—result in death threats.<br />Yet, there’s also neighborly kindness, life goes on, and there are celebrations. One of them, in which Mare plays a significant role, is the gala held in honor of the 25th anniversary of the high-school basketball championship—a victory in which Mare played a leading part. On this night, despite a limp resulting from a fall while chasing a suspect, she’s looking seriously glamorous. Enough to win the attention of a man new to the town—a novelist (Guy Pearce) who has a job as writer-in-residence at a nearby college.</td>

There are other countries that want to help Afghanistan, we are talking to them as well. It is a versatile process.”<br />Talks were continuing with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other U.S. officials, he added.<br />The Taliban reacted to the news by condemning Turkey for “extending the occupation of our country at the behest of and in agreement with America,” and the group warned that the Turkish troops that remain in Afghanistan will be considered occupiers and be dealt with accordingly.<br />“Responsibility for all consequences shall fall on the shoulders of those who interfere in the affairs of others and make such ill-advised decisions,” the Taliban said Tuesday.</td>

      <td>Starring Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany, the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s foray into old-time TV gets the genre right, but not much else.</td>
      <td>Even those viewers fully indoctrinated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its intersecting adventures, rococo mythologies and legion of superheroes may be confused by “WandaVision.” They’ll be wondering, among other things, why the characters themselves aren’t more visibly confused: If you found yourself in a postmodern remake of “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” not knowing how you got there or why, wouldn’t you discuss it with your spouse? If only to get your stories straight?<br />“WandaVision” finds Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), the lethal prestidigitator—aka Scarlet Witch—of various Marvel movies, and her similarly credentialed “synthezoid” husband, Vision (Paul Bettany), trapped in the world of ’60s sitcoms. At least they seem to be trapped. As of “Avengers: Endgame” Vision actually seemed to be dead. So the entirety of “WandaVision” could be a dream born of grief, taking place under Wanda’s Breck Girl hairdo.<br />At any rate, the befuddled couple seem to know who they are, but not whose lives they’re inhabiting, though the answer seems to be the Andersons, Ricardos and Petries (“Father Knows Best,” “I Love Lucy” and “Dick Van Dyke”). Their world at the outset is black and white. They have theme music. The era is late-’50s/early ’60s, although by episode 2 the presiding aesthetic is that of “Bewitched” (1964-72) and by episode 3 color has arrived, along with allusions to “The Brady Bunch” (1969-74). Like Vision, things move quickly, including a surprise pregnancy. Occasionally, a regularly scheduled radio program is interrupted by a squawking voice pleading through the static: “Who’s doing this to you, Wanda? Can you read me?”<br />“WandaVision” marks the so-called MCU’s entry into episodic TV—previous Marvel shows have been outside the MCU corporate umbrella—and only three episodes were made available for review. Which is a shame: Not until the end of episode 3 do matters seem poised to coalesce, and up till then “WandaVision” is a crashing bore.<br />The plot points are a Whitman’s Sampler of sitcom clichés deftly disinterred and tweaked—the forgotten anniversary, the dinner with the boss, the nasty neighbor lady who must be appeased. The writing is freakishly accurate in capturing the period humor, or lack thereof—Jac Schaeffer, the show’s creator, is also credited as lead writer, and she has perfect pitch for the kind of almost-funny gag lines that infested so many ’60s-’70s sitcoms and needed a laugh track to push them over the line into vaguely amusing. As an exercise in cloning, it’s all morbidly fascinating: The re-creations of the various classic shows and their styles display both a knowledge of and deep affection for old-time TV; the shooting styles, fashions and palettes are dead-on and the incremental changes taking place in ’60s society are reflected just the way they were in Big Three network prime-time programming.</td>

      <td>People are increasingly relying on apps like TikTok and 1 Second Everyday to sync bite-size home videos to the beat of a song. Here, how to make your own modern video diary.</td>
      <td>IN THE MIDST of New York City’s lockdown, Grey Vila, an artist who uses gender-neutral pronouns, was stuck an hour and a half away from their girlfriend. To cope with the separation, the pair began editing minute-long video tributes to their relationship, using TikTok to collage snippets of footage from their pre-pandemic life together. Once the reunited couple could record again, the montages multiplied. Set to upbeat music, they mirror the credits of a coming-of-age film: skateboards going down a ramp; a flash of the Williamsburg Bridge; a fruit-laden picnic blanket. “It makes you feel good about yourself and what you do with your time,” said Mx. Vila, 20.<br />As re-entry generates moments worth capturing again, people are increasingly turning to apps like TikTok and 1 Second Everyday to string short video clips together into shareable montages. Dr. Karen Sutherland, a Queensland, Australia, lecturer who studies social media, called the videos “today’s version of the photo album.”<br />TikTokers have been using the app for basic video-editing since it was released. But earlier this summer, users began a trend of syncing videos from their camera rolls to a particular, 17-second clip from the song “Swing Lynn” by Harmless. “Put 27 videos to this sound and let it romanticize your life,” their captions typically insist. (The app will automatically sync preselected videos to change on beat, ideal for a montage.) Hundreds of thousands of iterations now exist.<br />Cesar Kuriyama, founder of the app 1 Second Everyday, said he saw downloads more than double this year from March to June—when many Americans were receiving vaccinations. Launched in 2013, the app functions as a sort of video diary. If the TikTok trend encourages users to create a collection retroactively, 1SE works cumulatively. Users can take a single, second-long video every day (no sweat if you forget), which the app saves on a calendar and merges into a chronological series with a tap. Some users choose to make a monthly montage, while others prefer a time capsule for the year. A timestamp in the lower corner of each clip, similar to those on old-school videos, adds to the sense of time passing.<br />That throwback feeling was what prompted Corrie Lewis-Bishop, 54, to start filming her own monthly 1SE videos, which she shares on Instagram. “They reminded me of those short three-minute films from the ’70s and ’80s, those old yellowy family videos,” she said. A ceramicist in Port Talbot, Wales, she began making the collections for her art, but was soon including photos and videos of sunsets, outfits of the day and friends caught mid-laugh or midsentence. “There’s a built-in immediate nostalgia,” she said.</td>

If interest in the Paralympic program exceeds the current capacity, organizers will expand it to include another wave, a USOPC spokeswoman said.

Meanwhile, Covid-19-related production delays sidelined past honorees such as “Succession,” making more room for newcomers.<br />Streamers pushed cable and broadcast networks further to the margins in some categories. In the race for best comedy series, streaming shows claimed seven out of the eight nomination slots, up from three nominations in that category last year. They included some surprises, including Netflix’s “Karate Kid” update “Cobra Kai,” and “Emily in Paris,” which was heavily panned and emerged as a cult phenomenon.<br />Action-driven shows muscled in on prestige dramas, with  Amazon ’s  twist on the superhero genre, “The Boys,” nominated for best drama series, and joining “The Mandalorian,” which was nominated in the category for the second year in a row. Other drama-series nominees included past winner “The Handmaid’s Tale” (Hulu) and “Lovecraft Country,” a horror-driven HBO show that was canceled after one season.<br />Among the drama series, repeat nominees “Pose” (FX) and “This Is Us” (NBC) helped hold the line for TV networks. Among comedy series, NBC’s four-time nominee “black-ish” was the lone broadcast series in the pack.</td>

Calk, the founder and former chairman of the Federal Savings Bank in Chicago, was found guilty on both counts he faced: financial-institution bribery and conspiracy to commit financial-institution bribery. Federal prosecutors said Mr. Calk pushed the bank to approve the loans to Mr. Manafort, despite multiple red flags, because he hoped to be named secretary of the Army.<br />Mr. Calk’s lawyer, Paul Schoeman, argued at trial that Mr. Calk thought he was making profitable loans—which were unanimously approved by the bank’s loan committee—and said Mr. Calk wasn’t acting in bad faith. Instead, Mr. Schoeman said, Mr. Manafort and one of the bank’s loan officers were defrauding the bank Mr. Calk had dedicated his life to building.<br />Mr. Schoeman couldn’t immediately be reached for comment after the verdict.<br />The three-week trial in Manhattan federal court dealt with characters and issues familiar to other scandals of the Trump presidency, including Mr. Manafort’s business dealings, the chaos of former President Donald Trump’s transition team and the role of wealthy political neophytes in the administration.

JustInvest provides tools for investors and advisers to build bespoke portfolios.<br />The purchase gives Vanguard another way to deepen ties with advisers. Vanguard oversees some $7.9 trillion in assets. Of that, about $3 trillion has already come into Vanguard through advisers, brokerages and other such middlemen.<br />Vanguard expects to announce its agreement to buy JustInvest as soon as Tuesday. Vanguard will gain over a dozen new employees and roughly $1 billion in assets managed by JustInvest through the purchase. It couldn’t be learned how much Vanguard is paying for the company.<br />Financial advisers using JustInvest’s software can, for example, quickly screen out oil polluters, take bigger positions in gun makers or automate the task of optimizing after-tax returns. Each client’s investments can then be managed separately. JustInvest’s legal name is one word, however the firm more commonly goes by Just Invest as two words.</td>

      <td>Attempts to predict what the automotive industry will look like in 2030 only serve to highlight how uncertain its future really is.<br />On Tuesday,  Volkswagen  updated its long-term strategy under the tagline “new auto.” Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess and his team laid out how they saw the vehicle business changing this decade and how the company would use its scale as the market leader in Europe and China to take advantage.<br />Volkswagen expects electric vehicles to gradually replace traditional ones—so far so uncontroversial. But the market leader in Europe and China also is preparing for explosive growth in “software-enabled revenues.” Its presentation implied that this business might be almost as big as that of selling EVs by 2030.<br />The parallel is with smartphones:  Apple  gets much of its growth from selling services through its iPhones rather than the devices themselves. As cars become connected to the internet and updatable, in-vehicle services seem likely to proliferate. If cars ever become autonomous, freeing drivers to be passengers and even undermining the current dominant model of car ownership, demand for services could skyrocket.<br />Volkswagen isn’t the only one preparing to sell services.  Ford ’s  strategy day in May made much of the opportunities an “always-on” relationship with its customers might bring.  General Motors  has promised an investor event later this year to explore the area.</td>

      <td>The U.S. budget deficit narrowed to $2.2 trillion during the first nine months of the fiscal year from the same period a year earlier, with the gap between spending and revenue shrinking as the recovery from the pandemic-induced slump boosted tax collections.<br />Outlays for the first three quarters of the government’s budget year rose 6%, to $5.3 trillion, the Treasury Department said Tuesday. Spending has been boosted by pandemic-related costs that included tax credits, expanded unemployment compensation, emergency small-business loans and stimulus checks to households.<br />Federal revenue during the period rose 35% when compared with the previous year, to $3.1 trillion, largely due to higher receipts from individual and corporate income taxes.<br />For the month of June, the U.S. deficit was $174 billion, roughly a fifth of what it was a year earlier. Revenue rose 87% in June to $449 billion, while spending decreased 44% to $623 billion.<br />While receipts are rising as consumer and business spending picks up and employers add jobs, supply-chain challenges and a lack of workers for lower-paying jobs are headwinds to growth.</td>

      <td>Zionsville, Ind., a town of about 30,000, is a few hours south of Flint, Mich., by car. So when evidence emerged in 2014 that Flint’s water supply was dangerously contaminated, a Zionsville business executive, Megan Glover, began looking into ways to test the water coming from her own family’s tap. What she uncovered surprised her—not that the local supply was contaminated, but that a testing kit typically cost $3,000, an exorbitant amount most families in her neighborhood would never consider. So Ms. Glover did the most American thing possible: She researched the issue, developed a more affordable alternative, founded a company, sought out investors (my venture firm among them) and emerged as CEO of 120Water, a successful enterprise that now helps monitor the quality of the nation’s water supply. (Zionsville’s water turned out to be clean.)<br />The basic arc of Ms. Glover’s story—identifying a pain point, then creating a venture to provide a solution—is common in the nation’s premier tech hubs. That is largely because the talent and capital required to build a successful venture are widely available to entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, New York and Boston.<br />What makes Ms. Glover’s story remarkable is that she, like a burgeoning community of other tech entrepreneurs around the country, managed to build a successful venture without those ready-made advantages. In ways few of us predicted, the pandemic is poised to make Ms. Glover’s story much more common in the farthest-flung corners of the American economy.<br />Many have noted that talent and capital are starting to move out of the nation’s three major tech hubs and into various more affordable cities like Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Tulsa, Okla. But most are missing the more important point: The nation’s tech workers likely won’t work on the same kinds of projects that dominated their time when they were ensconced in their hubs. Entrepreneurs who previously worked in tech bubbles—places that have produced far too many photo-sharing apps—will suddenly be exposed to a wider range of real-world challenges that they likely would never have encountered without the pandemic.<br />Entrepreneurs are innately curious, looking to bump into ideas and people that can unearth problems to solve and opportunities to seize. But founders are unlikely to stumble into problems in sectors to which they have no exposure. And that is why the geographic diffusion of tech will change the industry at its very core. It is much harder to understand what bedevils the lives of people living in, say, Fayetteville, Ark., if your life rarely exposes you to people living outside the social and commercial networks of places like San Francisco or Cambridge, Mass.</td>

      <td>It’s worth examining the academic roots of a phrase that has become a catch-all.</td>
      <td>At its recent annual meeting, the National Education Association adopted an agenda item stating, “It is reasonable and appropriate for curriculum to be informed by academic frameworks for understanding and interpreting the impact of the past on current society, including critical race theory.”<br />Becky Pringle, the teachers union’s president, declared that “if this grand experiment in democracy is to succeed,” then “we must continuously do the work to challenge ourselves and others to dismantle the racist interconnected systems and the economic injustices that have perpetuated systemic inequities.”<br />Asked about the NEA’s decision, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that President Biden believes “children should learn about our history,” including the view that “there is systemic racism that is still impacting society today.”<br />With this statement, Mr. Biden has plunged headlong into a roiling national debate about critical race theory, and it isn’t clear he can win it. The issue has become central to the cultural agenda that Republicans hope to ride to victory in the midterm elections. The share of Americans who believe its impact on our society will be negative is twice as large as those with a positive assessment. Only 16% strongly support teaching critical race theory in public schools, compared with 29% who strongly oppose it.<br />Between Feb. 1 and June 13, Fox News mentioned critical race theory more than 1,300 times. Christopher Rufo, a young conservative activist who was instrumental in persuading President Trump to issue an executive order restricting diversity training throughout the executive branch, has a remarkably effective strategy. It’s no secret: In a well-known tweet, he described his plan for turning critical race theory “toxic” by putting “all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category.”</td>

      <td>Altus Power is the latest company in a slower-growing solar-power segment to go public via SPAC merger</td>
      <td>Two of today’s hottest investing trends are coming together: clean energy and special-purpose acquisition companies. Recent merger announcements in the space show that SPACs could be an effective growth engine for some corners of the renewable energy industry that have lagged behind as the industry overall has boomed.<br />Altus Power, a commercial and industrial-scale solar company, announced a merger Tuesday with a SPAC sponsored by  CBRE Group ,  giving Altus a market capitalization of $1.58 billion. The deal follows another solar-related SPAC announcement last week for concentrated solar power company Heliogen.<br />The kinds of renewable energy that investors are comfortable with—such as utility-scale solar and wind—are precisely the type of assets that already have hungry capital chasing them, whether yield-hungry pension funds or banks growing more conscious of social, environmental and governance criteria. Developers of such projects might find the extra costs and requirements of public listings not worth the trouble.<br />By contrast, Altus Power’s market—it targets installations on the roofs and parking lots of commercial properties—has been the slowest-growing solar segment. That is in large part because not all customers have standardized credit ratings, which makes it difficult to raise cheap financing from lenders. Lack of cheap financing in turn makes it harder for companies like Altus to chase more business. Assessing credit is easier for utility-scale solar, whose customers tend to be investment-graded utilities; and residential solar, whose customers all have FICO scores.<br />With that in mind, Altus’ tie-up with commercial real estate giant CBRE seems to make a lot of sense. The deal will give Altus access to CBRE’s clients, and the real-estate firm might have useful insights as to whether or not certain types of clients are creditworthy. The company is also eyeing ways to get more fees from existing customers by adding battery storage and electric-vehicle charging stations.</td>

      <td>The antitrust offensive and power grab will end with her wings melting in the courts.</td>
      <td>It’s a touch ominous when a bureaucrat begins her tenure by sending bipartisan procedural safeguards to the paper shredder. Federal Trade Commission Chairman Lina Khan wasted no time making confetti of the guardrails at the FTC, including the Obama administration policy statement placing minimal limits on how the agency could use its theretofore undefined power to police “unfair methods of competition.” Shredding the statement clears the way for Ms. Khan’s attempt to remake antitrust law in her image (“Lina Khan’s Power Grab at the FTC,” Review & Outlook, July 6). With the announcement of a global gag order on FTC staff, Ms. Khan has made it clear the FTC will now speak with one voice—hers.<br />All that has been overshadowed by an executive order aimed at competition and loaded with goodies, good intentions, new regulatory regimes and a blissful ignorance of unintended consequences (“Joe Biden, 20th Century Trustbuster,” Review & Outlook, July 10). Some of its pronouncements, like occupational-licensing reform, are to the good. But the FTC’s competition authority is about to become a free-for-all for the Biden administration to reshape the economy. One wonders how the Republicans going along with all this to “get Big Tech” are feeling right now; I’m guessing “played.” If not, they’ll catch up soon enough.<br />Imagining the FTC as Icarus flying without the constraints of history, economics or law is a fun thought experiment, but we’ve been here before. Ms. Khan’s initial steps are indicative of a regulatory overreach that will end with the FTC’s wings melting in the courts. This path does not lead to incremental, much less radical, change. I predict early headlines that appease a rabid base, frustration for FTC staff and a new, volatile partisanship at the agency, but actual results that leave unsatisfied the progressives aching for radical change.<br />Joshua D.

All the pieces were in place—staff, a board, resources—but we had to apply for recognition by the IRS as a 501(c)(3). It took more than 18 months to get a response. When the IRS’s response letter came in May, it seemed to examine in great detail the faith that informs the organization. It felt strange to have a bureaucrat examine our religion, belief in the Bible and how we believe our faith impacts the world.<br />Then came this sentence: “The bible teachings are typically affiliated with the [Republican] party and candidates. This disqualifies you from exemption under the IRC Section 501(c)(3).”<br />Because we believed in and taught the Bible, the IRS disqualified us from charitable recognition.

      <td>As designers and DIYers look for a finishing flourish and a way to visually expand a room, they’re adding pattern to the ceiling—known as the fifth wall</td>
      <td>APOLLINA BAKER had every intention of papering the walls of her children’s craft room. Then reality set in. “Paint splatter and markers often end up all over the walls,” said the attorney turned design consultant in Dripping Springs, Texas. “We decided to install wallpaper on the ceiling only.” She chose Hygge & West’s Daydream, in which blue swallows swirl through cotton-candy clouds. “The room seems so much bigger and taller with the ‘sky,’” said Mrs. Baker.<br />That perception-altering effect of papering the ceiling—and its sheer exuberance—has design experts and DIYers looking up. “More of our customers are making a statement through wallpapering the ceiling,” said Elizabeth Rees, founder of Chasing Paper in Milwaukee, Wis. “It provides an unexpected design moment, something we’ve been looking to create this past year.” Wrapping an entire room like a present skews maximalist, but you can add a more subtle dimension with textured neutrals like grasscloth. “People are starting to realize how much design potential has been hanging above their heads,” said Adam D’Agostine, chief marketing officer of A-Street Prints, another wallpaper company, in Randolph, Mass.<br />If your room otherwise features wall treatments with presence and a graphic rug, ignoring the topside is like wearing a ball gown without a tiara. “It’s a balance story,” said Karen B. Wolf, an interior designer in Short Hills, N.J. “With a patterned ceiling wallpaper, you tie the room together.”<br />For cohesion’s sake, paint walls and/or trim a shade you pull from the ceiling paper, suggested Dina Holland, an interior designer in Needham, Mass. A white perimeter looks unfinished, “like you started but got scared,” she said. In her children’s craft room, Mrs. Baker painted the built-in desk and cabinets in Farrow & Ball’s Stone Blue, picking up the color of the birds overhead. Mrs. Holland gave a powder room (shown) personality by combining sparse fish graphics on the walls with a dense coral print above, varying scale to give the eye a place to rest.<br />A couple of precautions: A pattern that relies on an up/down orientation to make sense can create discord because you come at the ceiling from multiple directions, noted Cathy Purple Cherry, a designer in Annapolis, Md. And removal can be quite challenging. But don’t let that dissuade you. Powder rooms in particular lend themselves to ceiling design, Mrs. Purple Cherry added, because visitors sit with little to do but check out the room, “and it’s kind of a peek-a-boo moment.”</td>

      <td>Keeping powder dry might be right move in this environment</td>
      <td>Sometimes playing for the long term means forgoing a dollar today.<br />Many investors will look past  JPMorgan Chase ’s  reserve release and related profit bump in Tuesday’s quarterly earnings report to measures of core revenue generation, particularly net interest income. Investors have generally hoped that measure would have started to look better by now.<br />As the bank previously indicated it would do, it lowered its net interest income guidance for 2021 to about $52.5 billion from $55 billion. Meanwhile, the company lifted its forecast for 2021 operating expenses by $1 billion to about $71 billion. These moves both hit future preprovision net revenue, a key measure many investors look at that excludes swings in loan-loss provisions.<br />None of this should be very surprising to investors. JPMorgan is making good on Chief Executive James Dimon’s longstanding view that this isn’t the right time to load up on low-yielding securities such as Treasury bonds, instead keeping powder dry ahead of what could be a very strong economy with inflation driving rates higher. JPMorgan’s average cash deposits with banks grew 14% in the second quarter versus the first quarter, while its investment securities portfolio was basically flat. Average quarterly loan assets, meanwhile, were up just 1% across the bank.<br />Investors should take note of a technical move here, too: The bank put more of its investments into the held-to-maturity bucket, rather than keeping them available for sale. That makes it harder for the bank to sell bonds and redeploy the money, but it importantly protects the bank’s capital levels from swings in the value of those securities. Preserving capital will be critical to have the flexibility to do more lending and payouts in the future.</td>

      <td>Inflation is unlikely to spiral any higher but could be stronger than in the pre-pandemic years for some time</td>
      <td>“Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice.” Robert Frost wasn’t writing about the inflation debate, but he might as well have.<br />A hint of fire is what we are seeing now. The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that consumer prices rose 0.9% in June from May. That put them 5.4% above their level a year earlier, marking the biggest on-the-year gain since June 2008. Core prices, which exclude food and energy to better reflect inflation’s trend, were up 4.5% from a year earlier, for the biggest gain since November 1991.<br />The big question now is to what degree those price increases are transitory. Comparisons with a year ago are still a bit messy, after all, since prices softened in the early stages of the Covid-19 crisis, while some of the factors pushing inflation higher seem unlikely to have much staying power. Used-car prices, for example, were up 45% from a year earlier—a result of the supply-chain issues that have limited the availability of new cars even as demand for vehicles has continued to grow.<br />Indeed, at least for now it looks as if inflation from a year ago may have reached its peak. The easy year-over-year comparisons are about to end, prices for many commodities have stopped rising on a monthly basis, and wholesale used-car prices have turned lower, economists at BofA Global Research point out.<br />That doesn’t mean the all-clear signal on inflation has been sounded. A swiftly growing economy, tightening job market and continuing supply-chain issues seem a ripe environment for prices to keep rising. There is evidence that consumers’ inflation expectations have shifted higher, which in itself makes for a more inflationary environment. Finally, the pandemic has brought about shifts in spending patterns that could continue to put upward pressure on prices.</td>

      <td>Costs are surging for many goods as the Covid-19 pandemic eases, but the impact is uneven</td>
      <td>Inflation heated up in June, driven by continued strong consumer demand and lingering supply constraints. Overall consumer prices rose 5.4% in June from the previous year, the highest 12-month rate since August 2008, the Labor Department said Tuesday.<br />But consumer prices don’t all move at the same pace or for the same reason. To get a sense of where inflation is heading, it helps to look at price movements item by item.<br />There are four main trends underlying the June inflation report. First are the items where prices fell sharply at the start of the pandemic and that are now returning to their pre-pandemic levels. Second are items where prices have temporarily risen above their pre-pandemic levels due to supply constraints and could come down. Third are items where prices are likely settling at a permanently higher level. And fourth are items where price increases have slowed rather than accelerated as a result of the pandemic, at least for now.<br />These trends exert competing forces on overall inflation as the economy adjusts to a new normal, said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics.<br />“It’s very unlikely a year from now we’d be seeing this continued type of rate of change in inflation,” she said.</td>

      <td>Thailand and Indonesia say they will give a booster shot to healthcare workers who received Sinovac</td>
      <td>Thailand became the latest country to signal waning confidence in a Chinese vaccine against the highly contagious Delta variant, saying it would offer booster shots of Western doses to healthcare workers.<br />Healthcare workers who received two doses of the vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. would be given a third shot made by either  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  or  AstraZeneca  PLC, Thailand’s health ministry said Monday. Those who had only one dose would receive AstraZeneca as their second.<br />The decision to mix the vaccines makes Thailand the latest country to show reservations about whether Chinese vaccines work well enough to protect medical workers against the Delta variant, which was first detected in India and is thought to be far more contagious than earlier versions of the virus. The strain has spread to at least 98 countries.<br />Indonesia said last week that it would offer medical workers a booster shot from  Moderna Inc.  Around 90% of the country’s medical staff have received two doses of the Sinovac vaccine, but hundreds have fallen ill from Covid-19, reducing medical manpower amid a surge of the virus, according to Indonesia’s health ministry and doctors’ groups.<br />Sinovac didn’t respond to a request for comment.</td>

      <td>One of the most unforgettable moments in the history of international basketball came during a press conference in the 1992 Olympics, when Charles Barkley offered a comprehensive scouting report of the Dream Team’s next opponent.<br />“I don’t know anything about Angola,” he says, “but Angola’s in trouble.”<br />That grainy clip sounds as outdated as it looks now that the U.S. appears to be a team in trouble. Not since Barkley was in Barcelona and the Americans began sending their best NBA players on a mission to destroy the rest of the world in basketball have they looked so vulnerable before the Olympics.<br />When the Nigerian men’s national basketball team had the misfortune of facing the Americans in 2012, for example, they lost by 83 points in the single biggest Team USA beatdown since they endangered Angola. The final score was a bit closer in their tuneup for the Tokyo Games on Saturday: Nigeria 90, U.S. 87.<br />One shocking loss for the heavily favored Americans in a friendly exhibition was unexpected but not too unsettling. Then they lost again on Monday to Australia.</td>

      <td>A new theory that reactivated older viruses are driving some of the coronavirus’s debilitating symptoms is gaining traction among some patient advocates</td>
      <td>More long Covid-19 patients are pushing to investigate what they believe is fueling some of their debilitating long-term symptoms: dormant viruses that have been reactivated by the coronavirus.<br />An estimated 10% to 30% of all Covid-19 patients suffer from symptoms weeks and months after first getting the illness, including many young, previously healthy people whose initial Covid-19 cases were mild. Symptoms can include brain fog, fatigue, shortness of breath, racing heart beat and an inability to tolerate physical or mental exertion.<br />Public health officials around the world are trying to figure out exactly what is causing the symptoms; the National Institutes of Health earlier this year unveiled a major initiative to study long Covid-19, backed by $1.15 billion in funding. Yet scientists still know very little about the causes of the condition, and have even fewer treatments to offer.<br />Most people—whether they have had Covid-19 or not—have dormant, normally harmless viruses in their body that they contracted years earlier. Among the most common are the herpes family of viruses. That includes the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes mononucleosis, as well as human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), which causes the common childhood illness sixth disease, the herpes simplex viruses, and herpes zoster, a reactivation of the chickenpox virus that can cause shingles. Such viruses can be reactivated at times by stress, including infections.<br />Some long Covid-19 patients and advocacy groups are urging doctors to test more regularly for reactivated viruses. With so few treatment options for long Covid-19, they say, it makes sense to see if a herpes antiviral drug might relieve symptoms. Some doctors say it is worth more testing and further study. Others say the tests are difficult to interpret—and that even if a latent virus does reactivate, it is unclear whether that is causing long Covid-19 symptoms.</td>

      <td>The kingdom under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed to create vital non-oil industries. It hasn’t happened.</td>
      <td>RIYADH—Saudi Arabia’s crown prince pledged five years ago to unshackle the economy from oil by 2020. But as the world’s top crude exporter seeks to maintain growth and generate jobs, the kingdom is redoubling its commitment to hydrocarbons and veering away from greener energy sources.<br />Saudi Arabia’s move to dial back its longer-term plans is bringing it into conflict with other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, such as the United Arab Emirates. The U.A.E. fears demand for crude will dry up faster than the Saudis think and is looking to sell as much as possible to finance the growth of other sectors such as tourism and technology. Saudi Arabia wants to go slow and extend the support it gets from crude further into the future. Last week, talks at OPEC broke down over whether to boost crude output.<br />“The Saudis want to drive at 60 miles per hour and the Emiratis want to go at 100,” said Ayham Kamel, Mideast head at political-risk advisory firm Eurasia Group. “The crown prince has realized that panic movement away from oil is actually not in Saudi Arabia’s interest.”<br />Under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia had aimed to have kicked its oil dependency by now. In 2016, he unveiled a plan to attract foreign capital and build industries beyond oil, such as manufacturing cars and weapons. The plan, dubbed Vision 2030, aimed to transform Saudi Arabia into an industrial powerhouse and move the kingdom away from the boom-and-bust cycles of global oil markets.<br />But while non-oil industries grew 2.9% in the first quarter from a year ago, the kingdom’s oil sector still contributes up to 80% of the country’s budget revenues, according to the World Bank. The bank said 88% of Saudi Arabia’s foreign income is from oil exports. And the share of oil sales in Saudi Arabia’s gross domestic product has actually increased to 24% in 2019 from 19% in 2016 when oil prices crashed, according to the World Bank.</td>

      <td><br />The world wants everything from Simone Biles, and she keeps on giving it. She pulls off some of the most difficult skills in gymnastics better than any of her competitors, then adds unimaginable ones. She takes an improbable winning streak and extends it again. Competing at 24 years old and showing everyone that she’s stronger than she was at 19—her age when she near-swept the 2016 Olympics in Rio—she is a real-time refutation of the assumption that late adolescence spells the end of a top gymnast’s career.<br />It’s all the more remarkable because of everything she’s had to get through to be here.<br />When I spoke to Biles via Zoom in late May, she was at her home in Spring, Texas—briefly—in between competitions. At the U.S. Classic held in Indianapolis a few days earlier, her first time under the bright lights after a 19-month pandemic layoff, she debuted the hardest vault in the history of women’s gymnastics, a Yurchenko double pike that lit up social media. She had a day off as she traveled back to Texas and was in the gym again the next day to prepare for national championships a week later.<br />Biles says that gymnastics, and the laser focus that training and competition demand, gives her a chance to ignore everything else. “It gives me a break; it’s kind of my safe zone,” she says.</td>

Both measures were up significantly from a year ago and better than the expectations of analysts polled by FactSet, who forecast profit of $10.25 a share.<br />This spring’s rapid U.S. economic recovery, helped by the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and extensive business reopening and hiring, energized banks’ deal makers. Corporate chieftains and buyout firms put hundreds of billions of dollars to work in big-ticket acquisitions. Investors gobbled up billions of dollars of stock sold by startups in marquee initial public offerings and private fundraising rounds. Goldman’s investment bankers brought in $3.61 billion in fees in the second quarter, up 36% from last year’s second quarter.<br />Goldman was an adviser on many of the quarter’s largest deals, including  AT&T Inc.’s  combination of its WarnerMedia division with  Discovery Inc.,  Medline Industries Inc.’s sale to a group of private-equity firms and  Microsoft Corp.’s  $16 billion acquisition of  Nuance Communications Inc.<br />Buoyant stock markets also fueled Goldman’s asset-management division, which includes funds and investments the bank manages for itself and for clients. Its revenue more than doubled to $5.13 billion. Results were boosted in part because the value of Goldman’s investments in public and private companies swelled as the stock market hit multiple new records.</td>

      <td>JPMorgan Chase  & Co. on Tuesday said second-quarter profit soared compared with a year ago, when the bank was stockpiling funds to prepare for a painful recession.<br />The nation’s biggest bank posted a profit of $11.95 billion, or $3.78 per share, compared with $4.69 billion or $1.38 per share a year ago. That beat the expectations of analysts, who had predicted $3.20 per share.<br />Yet revenue fell 8% to $30.48 billion from $33.08 billion a year ago, the result of depressed lending margins and lower trading revenue. Analysts had expected $29.97 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.<br />The divergence between profit and revenue is largely due to the extraordinary conditions of the second quarter of 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic appeared poised to decimate the economy. Then, JPMorgan set aside $10.47 billion to prepare for a wave of loan defaults. This quarter, the bank continued to free up pandemic loan-loss reserves, releasing another $3 billion and boosting its bottom line.<br />The second quarter will likely prove to be an in-between period for big banks like JPMorgan. Businesses that boomed throughout the pandemic, especially trading and investment banking, are slowing down from record paces. Corporate clients that last year nervously rushed to raise money are now flush with cash. Last year’s market chaos, which can be ideal for trading, has quieted now that the U.S. has gotten the pandemic under control.</td>

Gov. Greg Abbott called the special session after Democratic House members walked out before a voting deadline at the end of the regular legislative session in May, denying the body a quorum needed to vote on the proposed legislation.<br />House Democrats staged another walkout Monday, and dozens boarded chartered planes bound for Washington, D.C., where they hope to draw national support for their fight against the bills. The legislators will have to remain out of the state for weeks to successfully run out the clock on the 30-day special session. The Texas House requires at least two-thirds of its 150 members to be present to conduct official business.<br />In the House, which is scheduled to convene at 10 a.m. Tuesday, remaining members are expected to move for a “call of the House” to record who is there. Those present can then vote for absentee lawmakers to be arrested by law enforcement officers and forced to return to the chamber.<br />State Rep. Matt Shaheen, a North Texas Republican, said he and his colleagues would look at all options for getting Democrats to return to Austin. He said he would certainly vote to arrest the Democrats but acknowledged it was unlikely out-of-state law enforcement would be able and willing to do so to make them comply with legislative rules.</td>

United has also announced plans to buy 15 new supersonic jetliners being developed by Boom Technology Inc.<br />None of these new aircraft have flown yet, and it will be years before any of them carry passengers. The companies said they expect the new plane, known as the ES-19, to begin service by 2026.</td>

      <td>Scientists investigate possible fixes in race to understand blood clots linked to shots</td>
      <td>Johnson & Johnson ,   AstraZeneca  PLC and the University of Oxford, along with outside scientists, are conducting early-stage research into whether potential modifications of their Covid-19 vaccines could reduce or eliminate the risk of rare but serious blood clots associated with the shots, according to people close to the process.<br />Fast-developing clues into how the clots form—driven in part by independent scientists in Europe, the U.S. and Canada—are boosting hopes of identifying the cause and possibly re-engineering AstraZeneca’s shot by next year, according to some of these people. It is too early to know whether either shot can be modified, or whether doing so would make commercial sense, these people say.<br />A J&J spokesman said the company supports “continued research and analysis as we work with medical experts and global health authorities.” AstraZeneca has said it is “actively working with the regulators and scientific community to understand these extremely rare blood-clotting events, including information to drive early diagnosis and intervention, and appropriate treatment.”<br />Apart from the scientific hurdles, modifications might require changes to ownership rights or regulatory approvals. Still, the unprecedented scale and urgency of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout could fast-track the scientific research and legal issues, scientists say, just as it accelerated the development of the vaccines in the first place.<br />The risks of clotting combined with low blood platelets—a rare condition termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, or VITT—following the AstraZeneca shot are roughly 1 to 2 per 100,000 vaccinations, according to U.K. and European tallies of cases.</td>

      <td>When pro cyclist Lachlan Morton set out on his improbable adventure to ride the entire Tour de France route unsupported, even he couldn’t be sure he’d make it to Paris. The task ahead of him involved more than 3,200 miles of road. Not only was he riding all 21 stages, he was also covering the distance between them entirely on his bike and without team support.<br />But in the predawn hours of Tuesday morning, Morton rolled onto the Champs-Elysées. He hadn’t just survived. He survived with five days to spare—the Tour peloton, which started hours ahead of him, won’t hit Paris until Sunday evening.<br />Morton, who rides for the EF Education-Nippo team, had set out to recapture some of the buccaneering spirit of the grueling early Tours, long before tailored nutrition, roadside hotels, and plush team buses—all while raising money for World Bicycle Relief.<br />To complete his old-school lap of France, he spent 220 hours in the saddle over 18 days, pushing across 3424 miles and climbing nearly 215,000 feet that took him up the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the notorious Mont Ventoux (twice). He slept outdoors in a bag that forever seemed damp and ate only what he could buy along the way in gas stations, cafes, and an endless string of boulangeries.<br />“It’s really well beyond what we thought was possible,” EF team director and former Tour de France rider Jonathan Vaughters wrote in a text message. “We (and he) thought he’d hit Paris about 12 hours before the race…if he made it at all.”</td>

      <td>PARIS—France’s Competition Authority fined Google $593 million for allegedly violating orders to negotiate paid deals with news publishers, raising pressure on the company in a global fight over how and whether tech companies should pay for news.<br />The French regulator said that Google had violated its April 2020 orders that the  Alphabet Inc.  company must negotiate with publishers for the right to show snippets of their content in its search results. Those orders came after complaints from publishers that Google was sidestepping France’s implementation of a new European Union copyright directive.<br />Google has since reached paid deals with some French news publishers, such as Le Monde and Le Figaro, but not with others such as Agence France-Presse.<br />Isabelle de Silva, head of the competition authority, said the fine—among the larger fines from the French regulator in recent years—takes into account the “exceptional seriousness” of the alleged violations.<br />“When the Authority imposes orders on companies, they are required to apply them scrupulously, respecting their letter and spirit. In this instance, unfortunately, that was not the case,” Ms. de Silva said.</td>

Tokyo’s tight schedule of 339 Olympic events over 19 days leaves no room for postponement.<br />An early warning of the possibility of one Covid-positive athlete taking down others came from the Dutch gymnastics delegation late last week. All gymnasts and staff had been vaccinated, a spokesperson for their sports federation said. One of them nonetheless tested positive shortly ahead of their planned departure to Japan.<br />The result was that the entire men’s and women’s teams stayed grounded in the Netherlands. Everybody was tested again. Nobody else came back with a positive test, and the men’s team, which was not deemed to include any close contacts, departed for Tokyo on Sunday. The women’s team, the spokesperson said, is continuing to train individually in Heerenveen, with frequent testing, and will leave for Tokyo on Wednesday if all the results remain negative.<br />Since the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic, the virus has been a wily foe for anyone trying to operate sports around it, with the possibility of silent, airborne transmission from people with no obvious symptoms, and an incubation period of up to 14 days.</td>

      <td>A scramble for natural gas is creating pockets of scarcity in the global market, boosting prices for the fuel and for the electricity generated by burning it.<br />Rampant demand in China is sucking in chilled cargoes of gas from the U.S., after a year in which American energy companies throttled back production. A drought in Brazil has added to the competition by curtailing power output from hydroelectric dams.<br />Searing heat in Canada and the Pacific Northwest has also lifted gas demand. Some places are missing out, like Pakistan, where a shortage of gas and the delayed onset of the summer monsoon have prompted power outages.<br />Europe, in particular, is feeling the pinch. With vessels of liquefied natural gas heading to Asia, buyers on the continent have struggled to replenish tanks and caverns after a long and cold winter. Storage levels are the lowest for this time of year in a decade, said Natasha Fielding, a gas analyst at Argus Media.<br />The price of gas at a trading hub in the Netherlands shot to a record $13.10 per million British thermal units in July, according to S&P Global Platts data going back to 2004. Barring mild temperatures this winter, gas prices are likely to remain elevated globally for at least another year, according to Chris Midgley, head of analytics at the commodities-data firm.</td>

      <td>Amazon, Walmart and others are targets of ‘item not received’ fraud, which surged during pandemic</td>
      <td>Retailers say they are seeing a sharp increase in a type of return fraud in which consumers claim they never received their online orders even though they did.<br />The practice, known as “item not received” fraud, took off during the pandemic, when warehouses were backed up and carriers were overwhelmed by a surge in e-commerce orders. In some cases, consumers are hiring professional fraudsters, who market their services on social media and advertise refunds of as much as $20,000 at chains such as  Amazon . com Inc.,  Walmart Inc.  and  Target Corp.<br />“This type of fraud really skyrocketed with Covid-19,” said Dajana Gajic-Fisic, who heads e-commerce risk operations for Finish Line Inc. and the U.S. arm of  JD Sports ,  sellers of athletic shoes and apparel. Both companies are owned by JD Sports PLC. “There were a lot of people with a lot of time on their hands, and they researched how to do this,” Ms. Gajic-Fisic said.<br />Here is how it works. A consumer places an online order with a retailer. After the package arrives, the consumer—or the professional refunder the consumer has hired—calls the retailer’s customer-service department and says they didn’t receive the package.<br />Professional fraudsters research the return policies of individual retailers and know the loopholes, said Karisse Hendrick, founder of fraud-prevention company Chargelytics Consulting. “They game the system through trial and error,” she said. “Sometimes they’ll use an insider who has worked in customer service for a particular retailer.”</td>

      <td>U.S. consumer prices likely continued to climb swiftly in June, as the economic recovery gained steam and demand outpaced the supply of labor and materials.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate that the Labor Department will report the consumer-price index increased 5% in June from a year ago, matching May’s increase and continuing the highest 12-month rate since 2008. The so-called core price index, which excludes the often-volatile categories of food and energy, likely rose 4% from a year before, they estimate.<br />The index measures what consumers pay for goods and services, including clothes, groceries, restaurant meals, recreational activities and vehicles. Economists also think it increased a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in June from May.<br />Consumers are seeing prices rise for numerous reasons, as the U.S. economic recovery picks up. Richard F. Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp., said the main driver of June inflation was booming demand that outpaced the ability of businesses to keep up. Another factor, he said, was the recovery in prices for air travel, hotels, rental cars, entertainment and recreation—all services hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />“Demand is coming back very rapidly, and businesses are normalizing prices in the sense that they are making up for declines” earlier in the pandemic, he said.</td>

West Texas Intermediate futures, a key U.S. gauge, rose 0.4% to $74.41 a barrel.

The reading was far stronger than the 23.2% growth forecast by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, defying concerns that China’s post-Covid export boom was coming to an end.<br />China’s exports, a key engine of the country’s economic rebound after the coronavirus outbreak, had shown softness in recent months in the face of rising raw material costs, weakened overseas demand for Chinese-made goods and global shipping delays.<br />Lockdown measures introduced in late May to tame a flare-up in Covid-19 cases in the southern province of Guangdong, an economic and export stronghold, had economists worried about a prolonged impact on trade in Shenzhen’s Yantian port, one of the world’s busiest.<br />Tuesday’s data, however, have allayed some economists’ concerns.

      <td>Hg is investing around $1 billion in private-equity-backed financial-reporting software company insightsoftware, according to a filing made Tuesday with U.K. regulators.<br />The equity investment values insightsoftware at about $4 billion, and gives Hg joint control of the company alongside private-equity firm TA Associates, the document said.<br />Boston-based TA and ST6, a consultancy formed by software executives that advises private-equity funds, formed insightsoftware in 2018, and private-equity firm Genstar Capital joined as an investor the following year. Genstar and ST6 will stay on as minority shareholders in the company.<br />Based in Raleigh, N.C., insightsoftware makes financial-reporting and performance-management software used by over 28,000 customers. As it has grown, insightsoftware has also expanded its product offerings to budgeting, planning, tax, disclosure and other types of software.<br />The idea behind the company “was to build the leading enterprise software vendor to the office of the [chief financial officer], one that could handle all of their needs,” said Hythem El-Nazer, managing director at TA. Since its 2018 founding, insightsoftware has made 17 acquisitions and its revenue has grown from about $35 million to about $350 million, with a goal to hit $1 billion in the next few years, said Mr. El-Nazer.</td>

      <td>IFIT Health & Fitness Inc. will acquire Sweat, an online fitness training platform, ahead of an initial public offering that is expected in the fall, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />IFIT is buying Sweat, which was co-founded by trainer Kayla Itsines and CEO Tobi Pearce in 2015, for around $300 million, some of the people said. IFIT plans to keep Sweat, which is based in Australia, as a stand-alone brand and Ms. Itsines and Mr. Pearce as executives.<br />IFIT is beefing up its content offerings ahead of its anticipated IPO. The company, which owns NordicTrack, was recently valued in excess of $7 billion in its most recent round of funding in late 2020 and is expected to attain a valuation in excess of that in its IPO.<br />Should the company debut as planned later this year, it is expected to tap a market hungry for fast-growing companies in the busiest year for public offerings on record. IFIT’s closest competitor,  Peloton Interactive Inc.,  made its debut in late 2019, and while its stock price has tumbled this year after a recall of its treadmills, investors had raced into the stock. Even with the pullback, Peloton shares have more than quadrupled from their IPO price.<br />IFIT, formerly known as Icon Health & Fitness Inc., has been moving swiftly with its IPO plans and confidentially filed papers recently with the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the offering.</td>

The position requires Senate confirmation.<br />Commerce declined to comment. Mr. Estevez, currently a consultant with Deloitte Consulting LLP, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />During the Obama administration, Mr. Estevez was principal deputy undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics. Before that, he had other Pentagon positions overseeing logistics and managing the Defense Department’s vast supply chain.</td>

That means its customers may not get new Dreamliners for much of the traditionally busy summer travel season.<br />Boeing halted handing over Dreamliners to airlines in late May, after federal air-safety regulators declined to approve the plane maker’s proposed method of inspecting the jets for previously disclosed production defects. It was the second such pause in the past year.<br />It wasn’t immediately clear how the current delivery halt would affect Boeing’s Dreamliner production, but one person familiar with the matter said the company is expected to slow down its previously disclosed monthly output of five planes as it addresses the quality issues.<br />Boeing declined to comment.</td>

The Iraqi government has ordered an investigation into the cause of the fire, which continued after midnight local time.<br />Following an emergency meeting with ministers and top security officials, Iraq Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi suspended the hospital director, the head of the regional health department and the province’s head of civil defense. He also ordered that all three be detained during the investigation.<br />The fire amplifies the public pressure on Iraq’s government as it deals with crumbling infrastructure, an continuing economic crisis, the coronavirus pandemic and an array of security problems.</td>

      <td>Medicare officials are beginning a review of  Biogen Inc.’s  new Alzheimer’s drug to decide whether to standardize coverage of the medicine nationally, a widely-anticipated step that would allow the government to place limits on who can receive the medicine.<br />The review of Biogen’s drug, called Aduhelm, will include an analysis of published clinical studies and medical society guidelines, as well as two public hearings later this month to assess the therapy’s benefits, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said on Monday.<br />The so-called national coverage determination will decide whether Aduhelm is a “reasonable and necessary” treatment. If so, Medicare, the federal government’s health-insurance program for the elderly, is required by law to pay for it.<br />Yet it could still place restrictions on the drug, such as by limiting it to patients who match the criteria approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.<br />“We want to consider Medicare coverage of new treatments very carefully in light of the evidence available,” said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. “Our process will include opportunities to hear from many stakeholders, including patient advocacy groups, medical experts, states, issuers, industry professionals, and family members and caregivers of those living with this disease.”</td>

      <td>Biden sounds the right notes but there’s more the U.S. can do.</td>
      <td>The remarkable protests in Cuba this weekend show that the Cuban people still yearn for a life free of tyranny despite decades of repression. President Biden hit the right note on Monday by expressing American support for the protesters, and let’s hope he follows through by increasing pressure on the regime.<br />Protests aren’t uncommon in Cuba, where most people live in desperate poverty while a narrow governing elite benefit from a state-owned economy that depends on dollars and euros from abroad. But Sunday’s uprising was unusual it that it developed almost spontaneously and expanded across the island as the message spread on social media and apps like Telegram.<br />The protests weren’t planned or organized. Cubans massed in the streets to register their opposition to the economic fallout from Covid-19, which has been mismanaged on the island; widespread shortages of food and medicine; and the numerous daily blackouts from failing electric power.<br />Protesters picked up the cry of freedom and sang the popular “Patria y Vida” (Homeland and Life) as a way of repudiating Che Guevara’s revolutionary slogan “Homeland or Death.” Social media is dangerous to the dictatorship because it allows people to share their dissatisfaction and feel they aren’t alone.<br />This time is also different because Fidel Castro is dead, his brother Raúl no longer holds an official position, and successor Miguel Díaz-Canel has no claim to legitimacy beyond the military and intelligence services that back him. The public’s willingness to risk arrest by heading into the streets is a signal that their suffering is so great that most Cubans have nothing left to lose.</td>
