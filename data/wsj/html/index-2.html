      <td>Aung San Suu Kyi appeared before a court in a closed video hearing on Tuesday in connection with cases filed against her since Myanmar’s military ousted her government in a coup, though the lawyer appointed by her party wasn’t permitted to attend and learned from the judge later that police had accused her of two offenses.<br />Police had earlier filed charges against Ms. Suu Kyi over walkie talkies found in her house that they say were illegally imported. She was also accused of a second offense under a natural disaster management law, which has been applied in Myanmar against those who break pandemic-linked restrictions, the lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said.<br />Mr. Zaw wasn’t informed of the second allegation until he was briefed by the judge after the video proceedings, he said. A police spokesman didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />Protesters have been demanding for days that Ms. Suu Kyi, who commands immense popularity and was detained in her house in the capital, Naypyitaw, during the Feb. 1 coup, be set free. The coup ended a decadelong shift toward democracy, putting the military—which ruled for half a century before the transition—back in absolute control. Faced with international pressure and large street demonstrations, the generals have doubled down in recent days.<br />For the last two nights, they ordered near-total internet blackouts. In a show of force, tanks showed up in the streets of Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, on Sunday and Monday. Protesters familiar with military rule live in terror of nightly raids and arrests. Some neighborhoods have assembled teams to keep a watch and alert residents if security forces are sighted.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—Nine veteran pro-democracy activists appeared together in court Tuesday on charges related to the mass protests that rocked the city in 2019, in a trial that stands out for the number and prominence of the defendants facing prosecution.<br />They include 82-year-old pro-democracy campaigner Martin Lee, newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai and seven others who face charges of illegal assembly that carry possible sentences of up to five years in prison.<br />While the prosecution of Hong Kong’s opposition has become increasingly commonplace, the defendants in the trial beginning Tuesday are a Who’s Who of an earlier generation of activists who have been fighting for core issues like the rule of law and political participation since before the U.K. returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.<br />Mr. Lee is a U.K.-trained lawyer who co-founded the city’s first pro-democracy party and helped write Hong Kong’s foundational legal document, the 1990 Basic Law. Others charged include Margaret Ng, a 73-year-old barrister; Albert Ho, a 69-year-old lawyer and activist; Lee Cheuk-yan, a 64-year-old labor leader, and Leung Kwok-hung, also 64, a longtime politician and activist known as “Long Hair.”<br />Police arrested the group last April in coordinated early-morning raids that surprised many in the city, since those targeted were generally associated with peaceful activism and running for elected office—not the often bitter clashes between young protesters and the police. For many, the arrests signaled that authorities intended to go beyond prosecuting protesters who committed violence to crush the democracy movement itself.</td>

      <td>The spread of highly contagious coronavirus variants is accelerating in Europe, outpacing an already-slow vaccine rollout and forcing governments to extend and possibly tighten restrictions on civil society and businesses to prevent a new surge in infections before the end of the region’s winter.<br />A shortage of vaccines in the European Union—only 4.8% of Europeans have been vaccinated since late December—means the continent hasn’t even started the race against virus mutations that many experts say will define health policy in coming months and years.<br />Most European countries are experiencing a steady decline in infections following months of lockdowns, yet the spread of the new variants first identified in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil—known as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 respectively—is accelerating, meaning these viruses are rapidly gaining ground under cover from the overall declining numbers.<br />The three variants now circulating in Europe are believed to be more easily transmitted, and potentially more dangerous, than the original pathogen that still makes up the majority of cases in Europe. There is also mounting evidence that some strains might be less susceptible to the vaccines currently authorized in the region, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.<br />The variant first identified in Britain accounted for 96% of viral samples examined at three major laboratories in England by early February, compared with just over a third at the beginning of December, according to the U.K. government.</td>

      <td>Crude prices have made up their pandemic losses, but further gains are clouded by questions regarding where all the excess barrels went</td>
      <td>Oil is on the move: Both Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices have broken the $60-a-barrel mark, taking the commodity’s price back to where it was before the pandemic. But a mystery still casts a cloud over its recovery.<br />The unsolved question has to do with what is commonly referred to as the case of missing barrels, or the amount of oil that is unaccounted for by the International Energy Agency. It is a mystery that resurfaces every couple of years, particularly when there is a shock in energy markets.<br />In the first half of 2020, for example, the IEA determined that, based on its estimate of oil supply and demand, there was a global inventory increase of 1.39 billion barrels. Out of this, it observed that roughly a quarter had gone into spare storage in countries that are part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, while 8% was in floating storage and in transit. The remaining 68% was unaccounted for.<br />There is always some oil that isn’t tracked, but the number has been growing in more recent oil-market shocks. Last year’s reached a record: The volume of missing barrels in the first half of 2020 was the largest recorded gap between observed and implied inventories since at least 1990, according to an analysis from Bassam Fattouh, Andreas Economou and Michal Meidan of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. In fact, it was almost 10 times as large as the imbalance seen in the second half of 2008 when the global financial crisis hit.<br />One common explanation for the discrepancy is that these barrels simply don’t exist and that it reflects imprecise measurement. Demand is observed with lags, and supply is observed imprecisely, particularly from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, as the Oxford Institute report notes. “The IEA collects data from the governments. So if the government data is off, they’re off,” notes energy economist Philip Verleger. He suggests that the jump in missing barrels could be due to rather mundane reasons: More employees have been laid off or are working from home during the pandemic, which could have led to flawed data collection from primary sources. If true, it is a potentially bullish scenario for oil prices—it means there is much less crude out there than thought.</td>

      <td>Regulation beefs up consumer protection on retirement accounts</td>
      <td>The Labor Department said late last week that it will build upon a Trump administration regulation governing advice that affects the trillions of dollars in retirement accounts, rather than replace it.<br />The measure, which goes into effect Tuesday, will cause many rollovers, in which hundreds of billions of dollars move annually from 401(k)s to individual retirement accounts, to be more heavily regulated. It also gives investors who feel they have been given bad rollover advice the right to file a lawsuit or arbitration claim.<br />Because investment fees tend to be lower in 401(k) plans than in IRAs, “financial firms have a strong incentive to get you to move money out of your 401(k) plan into an IRA, where they can manage it more profitably,” said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America.<br />“This is a signal from the Labor Department that they are going to continue to beef up consumer protections to ensure rollover recommendations are really in consumers’ best interests,” she said.<br />The regulation also will hold advisers to IRA owners to a higher standard when it comes to managing conflicts of interest, including those that arise in the sale of products such as variable annuities that pay commissions or other sales incentives, said Fred Reish, a lawyer who specializes in employee benefits.</td>

The offering will help round out a somewhat disjointed set of Goldman banking products, which include savings accounts, unsecured personal loans and budgeting software that carry the Marcus brand and a credit card with  Apple  Inc.  that doesn’t.<br />With Marcus Invest and a forthcoming Marcus checking account, “we get to the point where we can be someone’s primary banking relationship, meaning we can be the digital bank on your phone,” said Stephanie Cohen, who was promoted to global co-head of Goldman’s consumer and wealth-management division in September after a stint as the bank’s strategy chief.<br />Among the beta testers for the Marcus Invest app was Chief Executive David Solomon.

But some investors say they are being compensated well for the risk—and Chinese companies are still less likely to run into financial trouble than their American counterparts.<br />As of Monday, yields on an ICE BofA index of Chinese offshore high-yield corporate bonds stood at 9.18%, a roughly 4.5-percentage-point premium over U.S. yields. That gulf has largely been driven by a rally pushing down U.S. yields and contrasts with an average difference over the last 10 years of 2.15 percentage point.<br />At the same time, about 2.5% of Chinese offshore high-yield debt by face value is likely to default this year, according to forecasts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. credit analysts led by SooChong Lim. The bank’s equivalent U.S. forecast is 3.5%.<br />“China high-yield is extremely cheap versus U.S. high-yield,” said Jean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging-markets fixed income for BNP Paribas Asset Management.</td>

      <td>In the long-term, stocks mostly go up. That single piece of advice has formed the core of many trillions of dollars of investment decisions. But it isn’t without detractors.<br />One of the counterarguments sometimes cited is Japan: The Nikkei 225 hit 30000 for the first time in three decades this week, but still hasn’t reached its 1989 zenith.<br />But that ignores the reality of reinvested dividends: Returns for most investors squirreling money away over a period of years are clearly positive.<br />If an investor had entered the market in December 1989, the very peak of the Japanese equity bubble, it may well have looked pretty bleak at times. For considerable periods over the past 32 years, an investor saving around 10,000 Japanese yen, the equivalent of about $95, per month would have been better off having kept it all in cash.<br />But right now, that stock investor would be sitting relatively pretty. A 10,000 Japanese yen investment in the MSCI Japan stock index each month since December 1989 would now be worth around 7.7 million yen—against around 4.4 million yen for the same money in a bank account offering a 1% interest rate.</td>

Gen. Russel Honoré to lead a review of the security infrastructure, interagency processes, and command and control. In a letter to House members on Monday she said, “It is clear from his findings and from the impeachment trial that we must get to the truth of how this happened.”<br />The commission could satisfy Democrats who want to see Mr. Trump and others held to greater account for the Jan. 6 riot after the former president was acquitted Saturday in a Senate impeachment trial. Seven Republicans joined all 50 Democrats in voting to find Mr. Trump guilty of inciting the insurrection. That fell short of the 67 Senate votes needed to convict.<br />Some Democrats, however, have suggested—as did Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell in a blistering speech about Mr. Trump after Saturday’s vote—that the best venue is outside Congress.<br />“I think there’s grounds for further proceedings, both civil and criminal, against former President Trump,” Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos,” noting he supports a 9/11-style commission.</td>

      <td>Parler, the social network popular with conservatives, has come back online after going dark when some tech companies withdrew their services in the wake of the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol.<br />Amazon.com Inc.  removed Parler from its cloud-computing service a little over a month ago, effectively knocking the network offline.  Apple Inc.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google removed it from their respective app stores. The tech companies said Parler had violated terms-of-service agreements, citing some of the content posted on the app.<br />On Monday, Parler said it was relaunching its service, which it said had grown to over 20 million users. “We’re thrilled to welcome everyone back,” Mark Meckler, Parler’s interim chief executive, said in a statement. “Parler is being run by an experienced team and is here to stay,” he said.<br />The social-media company said its new platform was “built on robust, sustainable, independent technology.” It said it was focused on restoring service to existing users during the first week and that new sign-ups would come after.<br />Parler’s Internet servers are now hosted by SkySilk Inc., which operates out of a Los Angeles-area data center, according to Doug Madory, director of Internet analysis with the network-monitoring firm Kentik Inc.</td>

      <td>Jan. 6 was a shameful day. A mob bloodied law enforcement and besieged the first branch of government. American citizens tried to use terrorism to stop a democratic proceeding they disliked.<br />There is no question former President Trump bears moral responsibility. His supporters stormed the Capitol because of the unhinged falsehoods he shouted into the world’s largest megaphone. His behavior during and after the chaos was also unconscionable, from attacking Vice President Mike Pence during the riot to praising the criminals after it ended.<br />I was as outraged as any member of Congress. But senators take our own oaths. Our job wasn’t to find some way, any way, to inflict a punishment. The Senate’s first and foundational duty was to protect the Constitution.<br />Some brilliant scholars believe the Senate can try and convict former officers. Others don’t. The text is unclear, and I don’t begrudge my colleagues their own conclusions. But after intense study, I concluded that Article II, Section 4 limits impeachment and conviction to current officers.<br />Everyone agrees that “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors” exhaust the valid grounds for conviction. It follows that the list of persons in that sentence—“the president, vice president, and all civil officers”—likewise exhausts its valid subjects.</td>

      <td>Washington was a savvy packager of his own personal virtues. He knew that if you don’t engage in a bit of self-aggrandizement, you lose.</td>
      <td>Playacting is a necessary part of democratic politics, for good and ill. Just as a great actor by definition doesn’t appear to be acting, the successful politician must convince other people of his own virtue and competence without appearing to be concerned with what people think of him. To put the point brutally, you can’t win elections if you’re unable or unwilling to tell people, or somehow to communicate to them, how great you are.<br />I have often thought the great exception to this rule must be George Washington. He did not seek the presidency of the new republic but had to be implored to fill it. I was wrong. The nation’s first president, as David O. Stewart shows in “George Washington: The Political Rise of America’s Founding Father,” carefully cultivated his reputation with the aim of winning preferment at every stage of his adult life. Washington, writes Mr. Stewart at the midpoint of his subject’s public career, “had captured the holy grail for public actors, operating as a politician with extraordinary success while at the same time not seeming to be one at all, with all the negative baggage that the label has always carried.” After 16 years as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses and six as a county magistrate and town trustee, “almost no one thought of him as a political operator, nor would they in the future.”<br />I was prepared to dislike the book. What I suspected was that Mr. Stewart would present Washington as a canny careerist who failed upward—that is, who escaped accountability for his mistakes and rose to the top of Revolution-era political life by means of charm and guile. Again I was wrong. The book is nothing like that. Mr. Stewart has written an outstanding biography that both avoids hagiography and acknowledges the greatness of Washington’s character, all while paying close attention to his rarely voiced but no less fierce political ambitions. He does not flinch from the cruelty of American slavery and Washington’s part in it, but situates him in the time and place of his origins rather than in ours. Mr. Stewart’s writing is clear, often superlative, his judgments are nuanced, and the whole has a narrative drive such a life deserves.<br />Washington was not excessively handsome (although to be fair he was far better looking in his youth and middle age than the famous Gilbert Stuart portrait suggests) but his mien and gait were legendary. Innumerable contemporaries remarked on his graceful walk and gestures, which combined with his physical dimensions (six feet tall, broad shoulders) to make crowded rooms go quiet upon his entry. He refined that advantage by his attire: “In a memorandum for a tailor,” Mr. Stewart notes, “he specified the number of buttonholes in his coat, its length, and the width of the lapels.”<br />“The chief part of my happiness,” Washington wrote in 1755, “[is] the esteem and notice the country has been pleased to honor me with.” He had achieved that esteem and notice by his account—and an accurate account it was—of a battle in which his own side was defeated, partly as a result of Washington’s poor choice of ground, but in which he exhibited spectacular bravery and endurance. He met with little success in other battles of the French and Indian War, not always through his own fault, but he maintained an ability to inspire the troops under his command with trust and courage.</td>

      <td>This has been one of the shortest and coldest diplomatic honeymoons on record.</td>
      <td>It hasn’t been the most promising start. Less than a month into Joe Biden’s presidency, and his administration is already engaged in spats with China, Russia and Iran. It is also discovering that U.S. allies are not quite as happy with Mr. Biden’s Feb. 4 announcement that “America is back” as many Democrats might have hoped.<br />In Asia the administration’s Myanmar policy—imposing sanctions that signal displeasure without materially affecting the army’s ability to rule—has attracted little enthusiasm. On Feb 15, India’s foreign minister hailed Indo-Japanese cooperation on regional infrastructure projects that link Myanmar with its neighbors, a not-so-subtle signal that India intends to go on cooperating with Myanmar no matter what Washington wants. Simultaneously, the large portion of the Indian press that supports the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is aflame with resentment that Vice President Kamala Harris’s niece, Meena Harris, seems to be siding with protesters against BJP policies.<br />European leaders are also dismissive of American moralism. French President Emmanuel Macron denounced the importation of U.S.-academic and cultural wokeness as a threat to the French way of life, while pragmatists on the Continent are pushing to strengthen economic relations with Russia and China—virtually ignoring the Biden administration’s efforts to raise the pressure on human-rights abusers in Moscow and Beijing. With the U.S. trade representative’s recent announcement that Trump-era retaliatory tariffs on European wine, cheese and food imports aren’t going away soon, this has been one of the shortest and coldest diplomatic honeymoons on record.<br />In the Middle East, Iran is showing no eagerness to ease the administration’s path back into the 2015 nuclear deal. And both Israel and the conservative Arab states resent the American shift in that direction. As for restless NATO ally Turkey, Mr. Biden promised during the campaign to help President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s opposition. The new administration has so far criticized a crackdown on pro-LGBTQ student demonstrators and called on Ankara to release the dissident Osman Kavala.<br />Closer to home, the unceremonious cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline miffed Canadians. The Biden administration appears headed for a fight with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over deforestation in the Amazon basin—a sensitive issue for the Brazilian right. Mexico’s left-populist President Andrés Manuel López Obrador delayed congratulating Mr. Biden on his election, passed a law limiting U.S.-Mexican collaboration over drug trafficking, and offered political asylum to Julian Assange.</td>

      <td>Workers have more to fear from well-meaning pols than from capitalism.</td>
      <td>As these things always do, it started out with the best intentions. In January the City Council of Long Beach, Calif., adopted an ordinance requiring large grocery-store chains to pay employees an extra $4 an hour. The idea was to reward them for the risks they took by doing their jobs amid the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />It didn’t turn out that way. In response to the ordinance,  Kroger Co.  announced it would close two Long Beach supermarkets. Once again, workers were sacrificed to greed. As local union leader John Grant told the Washington Post, “it’s reckless capitalism run amok.”<br />But is it?<br />As one of the world’s largest retailers, Kroger makes an easy villain. But instead of blaming “reckless capitalism,” might the fault lie with the reckless politicians who passed this measure? Thanks to their intervention, instead of finding an extra $4 an hour in their paychecks, nearly 200 grocery workers will now have no paychecks at all unless they are transferred to another store or find another job. It’s but the latest illustration of economist Thomas Sowell’s dictum that whatever a government might set it at, “the real minimum wage is always zero.”<br />What happened to these workers is worth bearing in mind as Congress debates whether to raise the federal minimum wage. For though the Long Beach ordinance was called “hero pay” and meant to be temporary, it operated as a minimum-wage increase for the affected grocery workers. And just as the Long Beach City Council passed it unanimously and without much thought that it could end up doing more harm to these workers than good, those now pressing Congress to include the $15-an-hour federal minimum wage in its Covid-19 relief package ask us to believe the costs would be nonexistent or minimal.</td>

      <td>‘By far the most difficult challenge was reporting that Trump had gotten something right.’</td>
      <td>Alexander Nazaryan of Yahoo News writing for the Atlantic, Feb. 11:<br /><br />Covering the [Trump] administration was thrilling for many journalists, in the way that I imagine storming Omaha Beach must have been for a 20-year-old fresh from the plains of Kansas. He hadn’t signed up for battle, but there he was, liberating France. France, by the way, is where Trump called American soldiers who’d fallen in combat “suckers” and “losers.” When this magazine first reported those comments, Trump’s supporters denounced the Atlantic story as preposterous and offensive, even as outlet after outlet confirmed the reporting. They failed to realize that the preposterous and the offensive were the twin beacons of the Trump presidency. Journalists were merely going where he led. This was our Omaha Beach. . . .<br />By far the most difficult challenge was reporting that Trump had gotten something right. This had a surreal, faintly futile quality, like trying to narrate a traffic jam play by play. I am thinking, in particular, of Trump’s push to reopen schools throughout the spring and summer. The push was poorly thought-out, rushed, and ineffective. It was also worth fighting for, only woe to the journalist who argued as much, as the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof would discover. To simply point out that Trump had improbably managed to alight on the correct course of action was to have written a favorable profile of Osama bin Laden.</td>

Pilots involved in some of the accidents have expressed concern about potential problems affecting nose wheels.<br />All of the planes suffered damage after touching down on the runway, according to the NTSB spokesman; no fatalities or serious injuries were reported.<br />An informal group of M600 pilots involved in the accidents is pushing for government action, arguing the common link appears to be a nose-gear problem during otherwise normal touchdowns, causing the planes to veer from the center of the runway. Steering is controlled through pedals that also move the plane’s rudder, a vertical panel on the tail.<br />In two of the accidents, aviators at the controls said, efforts to control the direction of the nose failed as they careened off the strip, causing severe damage that resulted in scrapping aircraft that can cost about $3.5 million apiece.</td>

It was the first of its kind to show such a high level of efficacy for Pfizer’s vaccine for those aged 70 and over, due to the limited scope of the earlier clinical trials, according to the healthcare provider.<br />The study was done so that each vaccinated individual was tested against an unvaccinated person who had a similar profile, including their risk level for infection, risk level of developing serious illness and overall health.<br />“It is now unequivocal that Pfizer’s vaccine against the coronavirus is incredibly effective in real life one week after the second dose, just as was found in the clinical study,” said Ran Balicer, Clalit’s chief innovation officer and one of the study’s authors, in a Hebrew statement published Sunday with the study.

The current outbreak began in late January, but was only identified as the Ebola virus on Sunday, health officials said, suggesting it may have spread substantially in the intervening weeks.<br />The outbreak four years ago left more than 11,000 dead across West Africa. The new outbreak comes as the continent grapples with a steady rise of coronavirus infection rates, driven at least in part by a more transmissible variant first detected in South Africa.<br />The outbreak also comes shortly after Congo, which has faced more Ebola outbreaks than any other nation in the world, also detected cases in the restive region of North Kivu. Health experts hope the availability of an Ebola vaccine will help bring the outbreak swiftly under control.<br />Guinea’s health minister Remy Lamah on Monday said the government was successfully identifying those at risk and was well prepared to combat a new resurgence. “The government calls upon the population in the affected areas to respect prevention measures,” he said.</td>

Herein is the paradox of the left’s climate agenda: The less we use fossil fuels, the more we need them.<br />A mix of ice and snow swept across the country this weekend as temperatures plunged below zero in the upper Midwest and into the teens in Houston. Cold snaps happen—the U.S. also experienced a Polar Vortex in 2019—as do heat waves. Yet the power grid is becoming less reliable due to growing reliance on wind and solar, which can’t provide power 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<br />While Texas is normally awash in gas and oil, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees the state’s wholesale power market, urged residents this weekend to conserve power to avoid power outages. Regulators rationed gas for commercial and industrial uses to ensure fuel for power plants and household heating.<br />Texas’s energy emergency could last all week as the weather is forecast to remain frigid. “My understanding is, the wind turbines are all frozen,” Public Utility Commission Chairman DeAnn Walker said Friday. “We are working already to try and ensure we have enough power but it’s taken a lot of coordination.”<br />Blame a perfect storm of bad government policies, timing and weather. Coal and nuclear are the most reliable sources of power. But competition from heavily subsidized wind power and inexpensive natural gas, combined with stricter emissions regulation, has caused coal’s share of Texas’s electricity to plunge by more than half in a decade to 18%.</td>

      <td>Record label will be spun out of Vivendi by end of year—positive news for investors, with possible exception of Amsterdam listing</td>
      <td>The world’s largest music company is finally going solo, although not in the usual venue.<br />On Saturday, Universal Music Group’s French owner  Vivendi  said that it will spin off its music business and list it in the Netherlands later this year. It had already broached the idea of taking the record label that works with Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift public in 2022. Strong investor appetite for music assets since the pandemic began might explain the accelerated timeline. The news sent Vivendi’s share price up one-fifth on Monday.<br />Once the spinoff is complete, the French company steered by billionaire Vincent Bolloré will still hold one-fifth of Universal. Chinese tech giant  Tencent  will own 20% after recently exercising an option to up its stake in the music giant at a €30 billion—equivalent to $36 billion—valuation. The remaining 60% will be handed to Vivendi investors in a special distribution.<br />Shareholders have been pushing for the move as a way to unlock value in the music business for years. Vivendi’s shares have traded at an average discount of around 10% to its sum-of-the-parts valuation since late 2017, according to Barclays analysts. Soon, investors will be able to get exposure to Universal directly rather than having to buy shares in the sprawling French conglomerate.<br />Although organizers of live concerts are suffering during the pandemic, streaming services have benefited as consumers spend more time listening to music. Spotify grew its monthly active users to 345 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 27% increase compared with the same period a year earlier. Major record labels such as Universal and Warner are raking in more royalties from digital music platforms as a result. In the third quarter, Universal’s streaming revenue increased by 23%, the fastest growth it has recorded since early 2019.</td>

      <td>Andy Kessler’s “Mediocrity Is Now Mandatory” (Inside View, Feb. 8) equates Reed College’s grading philosophy, which measures academic achievement by intellectual growth, with fragility and claims that Reed’s faculty “don’t even bother with meaningful grades.” Mr. Kessler cites the grading policy at Reed as evidence that diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives threaten to dethrone merit and promote a culture of mediocrity. This conjecture indicates a fundamental misunderstanding and mischaracterization of Reed’s approach to learning.<br />First, a conventional letter grade for each course is recorded for every student at Reed. In fact, Reed is renowned for an absence of grade inflation that reflects the rigor of our academic program and the high standards set by the faculty. This being said, it is true that letter grades are not shared with students unless requested. Instead, students receive robust ongoing feedback on their work, including lengthy comments on papers and exams. This practice fosters content proficiency, more creativity and intellectual curiosity, and stronger outcomes. Furthermore, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives actually lead to a more meritocratic society by giving more students access to top-quality education.<br />Demonstrating the power of our approach, Reed ranks fourth in the nation among colleges and universities in the percentage of graduates who go on to earn doctoral degrees. Bottom line, we know that when meeting the challenges of “real life,” the grades you received in college don’t matter if you didn’t learn the material.<br />Prof. Kathryn C.

      <td>Regarding John Bolton’s “Beijing Won’t Let America ‘Compartmentalize’ Climate Change” (op-ed, Feb. 4): It is naive to think that, in John Kerry’s words, climate change would ever be treated by the Chinese as “a critical stand-alone issue.” In fact, the Chinese will slow roll us on this crucial topic, as they do on every other matter, and at best offer toothless concessions on the climate in exchange for the U.S. ignoring the Uighurs, abandoning Taiwan and handing the South China Sea over to the Chinese navy.<br />The Chinese government has no choice but to come to grips with the effects of climate change in China. No nation burns more coal, has worse smog or more heavily pollutes the environment. There are more cars in China than in any other country, many without pollution controls of any kind, and more coal-burning power plants than in any country in the world. Even a totalitarian government like China’s will have to respond to the demands of its own citizens for cleaner skies and an end to lung-damaging pollution. The U.S. would be well advised to leave China out of the negotiations on any treaty, have the other nations of the world negotiate and sign it and then let China decide if it wants to be the international pariah of climate change.<br />James F.

      <td>JOHANNESBURG—The World Health Organization approved  AstraZeneca  PLC’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use on Monday, clearing the way for the first shipments of free vaccines in the West’s main effort to inoculate the world’s poorest nations.<br />Many developing countries rely on the WHO’s emergency-use listing—which signals that a vaccine is considered safe and effective and that its supply chain has been checked—to authorize the shots at home. It also triggers purchase orders that Covax, a WHO-supported initiative, made with vaccine manufacturers.<br />The Covax facility, which is financed mostly by Western governments and charitable groups such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, aims to supply some 2.27 billion vaccine doses this year to 145 countries, the majority free of charge. Doses produced by AstraZeneca and its manufacturing partners are expected to make up about a third of that effort, and more than half of the supply in the first half of the year.<br />“Today’s announcement…allows everybody to access vaccines,” said Deusdedit Mubangizi, who heads the WHO unit that approved the listing.<br />The initial approval covers doses produced by AstraZeneca and South Korea’s SK Bioscience. A separate emergency-use listing for the same shots made by the Serum Institute of India is expected to follow as early as Tuesday.</td>

However, her appointment was blocked by the Trump administration, which said she lacked experience on trade issues.<br />Earlier this month, shortly after South Korean Trade Minister Yoo Myung-Hee pulled out of the race, the Biden administration backed Ms. Okonjo-Iweala. She will be the WTO’s first African leader and her term, which starts March 1, will end in August 2025 unless renewed.<br />“The challenges facing the WTO are numerous and tricky, but they are not insurmountable,” Ms. Okonjo-Iweala said after being appointed. “There is light at the end of the tunnel if we work together in a transparent manner that builds trust.”</td>

Tali Farhadian Weinstein and Alvin Bragg worked as federal prosecutors in the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York, respectively. Lucy Lang, Diana Florence and Liz Crotty are alumni of the Manhattan district attorney’s office.<br />Running on the most reformist platforms are the three remaining candidates, all of whom have never worked as a prosecutor: Tahanie Aboushi, a civil rights attorney, Assemblyman Dan Quart, who is also a civil litigator, and Eliza Orlins, a Manhattan public defender.<br />All of them are campaigning on an overhaul of the justice system with promises that were once on the political fringes but are now hallmarks of the progressive prosecutor movement.<br />The Democratic primary, on June 22, is seen as the decisive election for the four-year job, as no Republican with strong appeal has emerged. Mr. Vance seems increasingly unlikely to run for a fourth term. A campaign spokesperson said she expects him to make an announcement about his intentions in the next few weeks.</td>

The show chronicles his rise as one of the country’s pioneering conceptual artists and includes everything from a rarely seen 1960 woodcut portrait of his mother, Dorothy, to his signature wordplay paintings. Also included are a pair of vellum drum skins on which he’s recently written slang he heard growing up, like “I never done nobody no harm.”<br />“Everything has an original source, and for me, that’s Oklahoma,” Mr. Ruscha said in a recent interview from his studio in Los Angeles.<br /><br />Since finding fame in the mid-1960s, Mr. Ruscha’s wry works have been steadily collected by major museums like the Museum of Modern Art and have resold for as much as $53 million at auction. Yet until now, he has never had a solo museum show in Oklahoma, where he lived from age 5 to 18.</td>

A decent man up against impossible odds, Gerald Ford’s self-estimation was shared by the American people, who drove him unceremoniously off the dealer’s lot of history and parked him out back.<br />There’s no such modesty in our modern political age. When a group of former Republican political consultants came together a little over a year ago to do what they could to destroy the Republican president, they saw no presumption in calling themselves the Lincoln Project.<br />Now that we know a little more about the performance and standards of the group, it looks more like the Edsel Project. Like its automotive predecessor, it was an expensive and wasteful machine that sucked a lot of money from overoptimistic, slightly credulous and ultimately very disappointed financial backers.<br />The collective’s name was intended to evoke not a high-caliber car but the highest-caliber president. That’s where it really fell short. The more we learn about the antics of this posse of political opportunists, the more resemblance they bear to the 45th president, whose character they deprecated, rather than the 16th, whose mantle they preposterously claimed.<br />Using a political campaign as a vessel for personal financial aggrandizement, thriving on the oxygen supplied by an endless succession of ratings-hungry television hosts, deploying a rare knack for nasty personal and vituperative rhetoric, and in the case of one of them, allegedly indulging a voracious appetite for sexual predation—if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, these guys must have idolized Donald Trump.

He has just gone to work for the new Biden administration. But he didn’t sign on for any traditional domestic economic job.<br />Instead, he now is deputy national security adviser.<br />That makes him the embodiment of a quiet but revolutionary way of thinking about America’s national security. Economic policy and foreign policy no longer are separate. Instead, the Biden administration, worried about American competitiveness around the globe, is making them one and the same.<br />This line of thinking about national security already was under way in the Trump administration, but President Biden and his aides are turbocharging it.

      <td>Members of a WHO origin probe have conflicts of interest.</td>
      <td>The world needs to learn all it can about the origins of the novel coronarivus, and the World Health Organization has been investigating. But there’s increasing reason to question the effort due to China’s lack of cooperation and conflicts of interest on the WHO team.<br />A Beijing-approved WHO delegation recently concluded a 12-day visit to Wuhan, where the virus emerged more than a year ago. The group visited local hospitals and sites like the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and Huanan Seafood Market. But such field trips aren’t very helpful without unhindered access to raw data. The Chinese government, which controls research into Covid-19’s origin, has limited WHO access to such information.<br />Chinese officials are spinning that Covid-19 came from outside China. Some Communist Party functionaries have suggested the virus was imported through frozen food, but few scientists take the idea seriously. Many believe it arrived through “zoonotic spillover,” passing perhaps from bats, through another species, to humans. Another theory is that the virus came from a laboratory such as the one in Wuhan.<br />The WIV has conducted controversial “gain of function” research on coronaviruses. Such experiments can provide viruses with new capabilities—such as the ability to infect a different species. The U.S. State Department has said “several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019” and had “symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.” This is important to investigate.<br />Yet the recent WHO trip ended with a propaganda coup for Beijing. Peter Ben Embarek, head of the WHO team, declared the lab hypothesis “extremely unlikely” and “not in the hypotheses that we will suggest for future studies.” Mr. Embarek said he had spoken with lab personnel extensively, and “they’re the best ones to dismiss the claims.” But apparently the frozen-food theory was worth looking into.</td>

Ivy League conference presidents rebuffed the proposal almost immediately, conference executive director Robin Harris said.<br />It’s a sign of the fierce pressure the eight Ivy League universities are under as the conference heads into a possible second year without sports as the coronavirus pandemic drags on.<br />The Ivy League was the first conference to call off athletic competition back in March 2020. Nearly one year later, the conference is still on the sidelines with no clear plans to restart.<br />The extended pause that was once seen as prudent is now a point of contention.</td>

      <td>A day before the inauguration, as Lady Gaga rehearsed “The Star-Spangled Banner” in Washington, D.C., wildfires burned in Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Ventura counties in California, shocking climatologists who had never witnessed the state’s fire season extend into January. NASA had just announced that 2020 tied with 2016 for the warmest year on record. As the Covid-19 pandemic drove city dwellers to search for places that felt surer, safer—Vermont, Kansas, Idaho—the FBI began arresting Americans who had rioted in the U.S. Capitol. Online sales of “prepper” gear (gas masks, food preservation kits) were brisk.<br />Bill Gates was at his lakeside compound in Seattle, gearing up for his next effort to save the planet from mass extinction. For 20 years, Gates has been studying the twin global afflictions of disease and poverty. These efforts led him to consider climate change and its vexing impact on civilization. This month, Knopf will publish his latest book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster. Remarkably, given the state of the world, it is an optimistic, can-do sort of book, chock-full of solutions for a problem President Jimmy Carter began warning about in 1977.<br />Last month’s inauguration of President Joe Biden had a big influence on Gates’s outlook. An earlier draft of the book included measures for a second Donald Trump term. In November, after the election, he edited these parts out, including provisions for how U.S. state and foreign governments could account for an absence of federal support. Another Trump win, Gates says, would have left us “holding our breath for four years and trying not to turn blue.”<br />“I hope Joe Biden stays healthy,” he had told me during our first virtual interview in December, while seated in a glass-walled conference room at Gates Ventures known as the fishbowl, where he has been taking meetings and relying on the  Microsoft  Teams platform during the pandemic.<br />Seattle’s Lake Washington glints over his shoulder, where far below a distant motorboat leaves a wake as Gates slips into his preferred posture, slouched with an ankle across a knee in an ergonomic conference-room chair. Gates, who is 65, has already confronted intractable problems, from trying to eradicate polio to epic rivalries with Steve Jobs and Google. The co-founder of Microsoft also sounded the alarm early about the need to prepare for a global pandemic. Climate change is yet another challenge Gates has served onto his own plate.</td>

      <td>On Instagram, thousands of amateur fashion influencers post outfit photos each day—often begging their partners, friends or even their kids to be their personal photographers</td>
      <td>WE ARE LIVING in the golden age of the “fit pic.” Contrary to what it might sound like, a fit pic is not an indulgent, muscle-baring selfie. The term usually describes an outfit photo, documenting what a person is wearing from head to toe.<br />On Instagram, which launched in 2010, the fit pic has exploded into a mainstream phenomenon. Over 144,000 photos are currently hashtagged #fitpic. The posting of fit pic after fit pic has even become a full-time job for fashion influencers like Caroline Daur (over 2.8 million followers), Bryan Yambao (over 590,000 followers) and Reese Blutstein (over 328,000 followers). These careerist fit-posters are careful to “tag” each item they’re wearing, so their followers—and, maybe more importantly, the brands on display—know the handbag is from Gucci and the loafers are Loewe.<br />But countless average folks, with non-fashion day jobs, also occupy the fit-pic universe. While a full-fledged influencer might have the time and resources—including, say, a professional photographer—to capture just the perfect shot, part-time posters, who dash off a fit pic before ducking into their cubicles or between Zoom calls, do not. Which raises the question: Who exactly is taking the picture?<br />Several savvy Instagrammers I reached out to explained that they employ a self-timer and a tripod, lending pro polish to their solo fit pics. Others said they’ll beg patient friends to step in as their personal Annie Leibovitzes during coffee runs or after a social lunch.<br />Often though, the burden of shooting a fit pic falls on one’s significant other. Partners Justin Andrada, 24, and Melissa Yan, 25, both work in the financial sector in California’s Bay Area and share a passion for good clothes. During quarantine last year, they started @whatyoudressingfor, a joint Instagram account documenting their outfits. They’re lucky to have each other “on set”—one aims the iPhone while the other walks back and forth in frame with careful indifference. Then they switch roles. As Mr. Andrada explained, while working from home, they didn’t have a chance to show off their carefully calibrated outfits to friends or even strangers on the street. At least their Instagram followers (so far numbering 157) could appreciate Ms. Yan’s swirly Kapital fleece, or Mr. Andrada’s Evan Kinori jacket worn over a Lady White Co. hoodie.</td>

Several schools said Covid-19 made it difficult to gather the data they must submit to be ranked.<br />More than bragging rights hang in the balance—though there are plenty of those, too. Schools say a good showing in rankings can draw interest from prospective students, stoking application volumes, as well as plaudits or pans from alumni who continue to track their alma mater long after leaving campus.<br />Overall, 62% of programs plan to participate in some rankings, while 10% don’t plan to cooperate for any lists this year, according to a survey of business-school admissions officials by Kaplan, the education subsidiary of the Graham Holdings Co.<br />Bloomberg Businessweek suspended its 2020 ranking, the only major list to do so. Dozens of notable schools were missing from the Economist’s list published last month. Nine schools that normally take part in the FT’s list chose not to participate, a spokeswoman said.</td>

Over 150 million Americans are under some kind of winter advisory, the National Weather Service said Monday.

      <td>The sharing economy started as a way to fill spare bedrooms and reuse old power drills. It now includes the rich flying around in private jets.<br />Last week, troubled Canadian manufacturer Bombardier said it would cease production of its storied Learjet before the end of 2021, and would cut 1,600 jobs. The writing had been on the wall for the light-jet line for some time, as buyers shifted toward heavier private planes.<br />Ironically, some now see better prospects for the Learjet’s market segment than for most in the embattled aviation industry. Analysts at Jefferies expect private aircraft deliveries to rise 10% this year, after a 24% decline in 2020, led by light and medium-size jets. Heavy ones are forecast to keep falling.<br />This is partly because of travel restrictions on long-range destinations, but it could also be an early sign of yet another transformation within private aviation.<br />Last week, Dubai-based private-aviation company Vista Global said new members for its VistaJet subscription service, in which customers pay per hour flown and have guaranteed access to a plane within 24 hours, increased 29% last year. Its sister brand XO tripled its sales of new memberships.</td>

Then the buzzy stock plunged nearly 80%.<br />GameStop’s volatile ride is hitting the portfolios of individual investors like Mr. Vergara who purchased the stock in a social-media-fueled frenzy. These casual traders say GameStop was their “YOLO,” or “you only live once,” trade. They bought around its late January peak, betting it would continue its astronomical climb. While some cashed out before it crashed, others who hung onto their shares are in the red.<br />Mr. Vergara, a 25-year-old security guard in Virginia, started investing four years ago after deciding he wanted to retire young. To save money, he drives a 1998 Honda Civic, eats a lot of rice and lives with his dad. He stashed his savings mostly in diversified index funds, which are now valued at about $50,000. Then Mr. Vergara, a longtime reader of the WallStreetBets page on Reddit, saw others posting about buying GameStop shares and the stock’s colossal rise.<br />He didn’t want to touch his index-fund investments, so instead he got a personal loan with an 11.19% interest rate from a credit union and used it to fund most of his GameStop purchase. He bought shares at $234 each.<br />GameStop shares started the year around $19, zoomed to nearly $350 (and almost hit $500 in intraday trading) in late January, and then began to spiral back to earth. The shares closed Friday at $52.40, down 85% from the peak close.</td>

It was one of the many strange expressions of the brain fog that has plagued the social worker in Wichita, Kan., ever since she contracted the virus last November.<br />Ms. Shaffer is a Covid long-hauler, someone who suffers from chronic symptoms for weeks or months after their initial infection. After her failed early attempts to return to the hospital, she hasn’t worked a full day since she got sick, and has no idea if or when she will go back in person.<br />“I’m a trained therapist and clinical social worker, but cannot complete even the most basic tasks before me,” says Ms. Shaffer, 52. She recently started working from home, though she hasn’t yet clocked an eight-hour day.<br />It isn’t easy for Covid long-haulers to return to work. Scientists are just beginning to understand the mysteries of chronic Covid, also called long Covid or post-acute Covid. It can lead to various symptoms after initial infection, including severe fatigue, cognitive issues, digestive problems, erratic heart rates, headaches, dizziness, and fluctuating blood pressure.<br />It’s unclear exactly how many people suffer long-lasting symptoms. But studies suggest it’s a significant portion of the more than 107 million people with confirmed cases around the world. Some 26% of 1,733 Chinese Covid patients discharged from a Wuhan hospital between January and May 2020 still experienced fatigue six months after acute infection, according to a study published in January in the Lancet.</td>

It will be hosted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Japan, Germany, Italy, the U.K. and Canada.<br />The White House said Mr. Biden would also focus on the global economic recovery “including the importance of all industrialized countries maintaining economic support for the recovery and collective measures to build back better.…President Biden will also discuss the need to make investments to strengthen our collective competitiveness and the importance of updating global rules to tackle economic challenges such as those posed by China.”<br />Mr. Biden will also raise concerns about climate change, the White House said.

      <td>He may run again, but he won’t win another national election.</td>
      <td>The Senate failed Saturday to convict Donald Trump on the single House impeachment article of inciting an insurrection, but the 57-43 vote was no vindication. The statements by Senators who voted to acquit make clear that he escaped conviction mainly—perhaps only—because he is no longer President.<br />Seven Republicans joined every Democrat in the most bipartisan conviction vote in history. While short of the 67 votes needed to convict, most Republicans didn’t defend Mr. Trump’s words or actions on Jan. 6 or his attempts to overturn the election. As we’ve written before, Mr. Trump’s behavior was inexcusable and will mar his legacy for all time.<br />That was the essence of Sen. Mitch McConnell’s post-trial remarks. The GOP leader voted against conviction but explicitly because he said the Constitution reserves the impeachment power only for Presidents while in office. Scholars disagree on this point, and there are good arguments on both sides. Mr. McConnell leaned on the writing of the 19th-century Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story. But he also noted that impeaching a private citizen had no “limiting principle,” and could set a dangerous precedent.<br />This is no mere “technicality,” as Democrats and their media echoes are calling it. Democrats spent days invoking the Constitution in the trial, but suddenly it’s a technicality after the trial. Most Republicans also cited the constitutional claim that Mr. McConnell used to justify acquittal, as did the Senators in 1876 who acquitted the former Secretary of War, William Belknap, after he had resigned in the only other ex-post trial.<br />But Mr. McConnell was lacerating in his criticism of Mr. Trump’s words and actions, which he blamed for deceiving and motivating supporters who had assembled on Jan. 6 at the President’s urging and became a mob. “Former President Trump’s actions that preceded the riot were a disgraceful, disgraceful dereliction of duty,” Mr. McConnell said. “There’s no question—none—that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The end of the Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump sets the stage for his successor to pursue his agenda with a Congress no longer encumbered by the wrenching task of accounting for the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />The reality for President Biden, however, is that in pursuing priorities from pandemic relief to measures to address climate change and infrastructure renewal, he will have a difficult time achieving the bipartisanship the Senate showed in the trial that failed to convict Mr. Trump.<br />To the disappointment of congressional Democrats, Mr. Trump on Saturday evening was acquitted on the charge that he incited the Jan. 6 riot because House managers fell short of the 67 Senate votes needed to convict. But seven Republicans—some staunchly conservative on many issues—joined all 50 Democrats in voting to find Mr. Trump guilty of inciting the insurrection, the most bipartisan support for conviction in a presidential impeachment.<br />Republicans, who no longer control the White House or either chamber of Congress, are now divided between those who back Mr. Trump and those who wish he would fade away. For many, the path to recovering power will mean uniting those two factions around a common cause.<br />By the Sunday morning after the impeachment trial, it was clear that one cause will be to rally in opposition to Mr. Biden’s agenda, and the GOP’s most strident voices were already signaling that fight. “My goal is to win in 2022 to stop the most radical agenda I’ve seen coming out of the Democratic presidency of Joe Biden,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) on Fox News.</td>

He was 90 years old.<br />President Alberto Fernández decreed three days of mourning.<br />Often seen surrounded by models and posing with his red Ferrari, Mr. Menem projected a flamboyant, bon vivant persona that reflected the prosperity he sought during his decadelong rule beginning in 1989. His tenure was marked by the adoption of the Washington Consensus, a package of economic measures promoted by the U.S. and multilateral lenders that included cutbacks in social spending, privatizations of state-run companies and pensions, and pegging the value of the national peso to that of the U.S. dollar.<br />For a time, those actions tamed the hyperinflation and food riots that had weighed on Mr. Menem’s predecessor, allowing Argentines to access credit, splurge on trips to Miami and import German automobiles. But the measures also laid the groundwork for a severe debt crisis that plunged the South American nation into turmoil and opened the door to a series of leftist populist leaders.<br />The phrase “pizza and Champagne” was used to describe the new Argentine society and the nouveau riche that sprouted during Mr. Menem’s time in office, said veteran journalist and television presenter Jorge Lanata. In cultural terms, Mr. Menem’s rule “coincides with the peak of cocaine in Argentina, easy money and superficial success,” Mr. Lanata said, “which we are still paying for.”</td>

In 10 of his cases, including one involving an employee at a meatpacking plant, the workers died.<br />Every claim has been denied. The insurers that denied the claims have said it can’t be proved that the workers were infected on the job. Mr. Rivero said he plans to challenge the denials in court.<br />Determining where a person contracted Covid-19 is proving to be a difficult legal puzzle. In many workers’ compensation cases, carriers said individuals were most likely infected in their off hours, while workers’ attorneys said their clients’ Covid-19 cases were directly linked with unsafe job environments.<br />Insurance carriers and business groups feared at the start of the pandemic that they would be overwhelmed by workers’ comp claims related to Covid-19. That concern intensified as more than a dozen states passed laws giving some employees including nurses and firefighters a presumption of eligibility, or access to workers’ comp coverage without requiring them to prove infections occurred on the job.<br />Those fears turned out to be unfounded. Workers filed hundreds of thousands of virus-related claims in 2020, but those cases, according to state and industry data, were more than offset by a steep drop in non-Covid-19 claims as layoffs, shutdowns and remote work reduced the number of workplace accidents and injuries.</td>

A widespread return isn’t expected to begin until the late spring or early summer, according to business leaders and recent worker surveys. But the slow return could signal that a significant increase in employees returning to work will lag behind progress made on containing the pandemic.<br />Office employees started to head back to work through the summer and early fall in some parts of the country as lockdowns eased and the spread of Covid-19 slowed. An average of more than 27% of workforces were back at their desks by mid-October in the 10 large U.S. cities tracked by Kastle Systems, a security company that monitors access-card swipes in more than 2,500 office buildings.<br />That rate in those 10 cities was down to 23.8% of workers the first week of February, slightly down from the 24.2% the previous week, Kastle said.<br />The same barriers that have kept most people at home for nearly a year remain. Employers are hesitant to ask workers to come back because they can’t assure them they won’t get sick from returning.</td>

It tries to do two jobs—be as mobile as a phone and as powerful as a computer—and in doing so, it makes compromises. But I’m realizing its versatility outweighs the compromises. Proof? Lately, I’ve found myself reaching for my iPad far more often than my MacBook. Here’s why:<br />• The iPad is faster. It takes far less time to boot up and load apps than my Intel-powered MacBook Pro. When I get a phone call, I can fire up the iPad and immediately start taking notes with a keyboard or the Apple Pencil.

      <td>Working across the aisle is a key part of his appeal to swing voters—and Mitch McConnell knows it.</td>
      <td>When you work in the White House, you reserve only the toughest of tough decisions for the president. If the best option is clear or obvious, the staff signs off before it reaches the Oval Office. As President Biden wrestles with a pandemic, a stalling economy and the GOP’s recalcitrant leadership, every potential move comes with serious trade-offs. Like every president, Mr. Biden’s success will be determined by how deftly he balances policy and politics as well as his short- and long-term objectives.<br />Mr. Biden’s legacy will be defined largely by how well he handles Covid-19 and whether he can rev up the economy. His pledge to unify the country distinguished him as a candidate. Because many voters view bipartisanship as a core part of his character, abandoning it risks undermining his central appeal to swing voters and others. Keenly aware of the president’s situation, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is looking to force him into a no-win choice between a short-term legislative success and long-term bipartisanship. Mr. Biden’s challenge is to avoid Mr. McConnell’s trap—to pursue the robust pandemic relief package the country needs without destroying his relationships with moderate Republicans who will be crucial to passing his plan to “build back better.”<br />Mr. McConnell is playing the long game as always. He knows that Mr. Biden won’t scale back the funding required to get the country past this long, dark winter. As minority leader, he can’t stop Democrats from using the tools provided through the budget reconciliation process; he used the same strategy when championing tax cuts in 2017. He wants to make Mr. Biden’s coming legislative victory as costly as it can be politically, framing it to the public as evidence that the president’s professed devotion to bipartisanship was merely lip service. If senators come to believe that the president is stiff-arming Republicans, Mr. McConnell will more easily convince his GOP colleagues to join him in obstructing the rest of the president’s agenda.<br />This is not only an economic debate; it’s a political balancing act. The near-term risk of sliding into a double-dip recession is much more dangerous than the possibility that inflation may return this summer. If the nation slips into another recession, the president will quickly lose his political capital. In other words, the country can’t afford for Mr. Biden to abandon today for tomorrow, and Mr. McConnell is using that reality as leverage. As President Clinton’s tenure made clear, tough, single-party economic fixes passed at an administration’s outset can open the door to bipartisan successes down the line.<br />That said, Mr. Biden can’t ignore the political risk of steamrolling the GOP. A majority of Americans (especially independents) want him to follow through on his promise to work across the aisle. If “build back better” is the north star for this administration, Mr. Biden will need Republicans who vote against the relief package to work with him on climate, infrastructure, education and more.</td>

That means being in fresh air, under trees and away from cars and concrete—on a regular basis. And, no, the Peloton doesn’t count.<br />“There’s an urgent need emerging in science and at the gut level to increase the nature experience. This field is just exploding,” says Gretchen Daily, a professor of environmental science at Stanford University.<br />The benefits have been clear to scientists for some time, but the pandemic has made the matter more urgent. The physical and emotional toll the virus has taken, especially in urban areas with little green space, has galvanized doctors, researchers and others to tap into nature’s therapeutic effects.<br />Spending time in the woods—a practice the Japanese call “forest bathing”—is strongly linked to lower blood pressure, heart rate and stress hormones and decreased anxiety, depression and fatigue.</td>

      <td>European banks are using the pandemic to make changes investors have wanted for years: slash jobs, shut branches and force customers online.<br />Germany’s second-largest lender,  Commerzbank AG , said Thursday that it would cut a third of its domestic staff and almost half of its bricks-and-mortar presence after pressure from U.S. shareholder Cerberus Capital Management. Bank mergers under way in Italy and Spain are expected to close thousands of overlapping branches. Business consulting firm Kearney predicts one-quarter of Europe’s 165,000 bank branches will be gone in three years.<br />Banks are one of Europe’s economic weak links, and they have been slow to change. Compared with U.S. peers, European banks struggle to make enough money to support lending growth. They came into the Covid-19 crisis still digesting a mountain of bad loans from the sovereign-debt crisis that started more than a decade ago.<br />The pandemic injected urgency into the situation. The European Central Bank has leaned on banks to reform and has paved the way for cost-saving mergers. National governments, long resistant to approving bank mergers that would result in job cuts, have changed their tune. Dreary stock-market valuations have spurred CEOs to act.<br />“The pandemic, to some extent, has been a catalyst for banks to bite the bullet and start addressing these weaknesses in a more radical way,” Andrea Enria, head of banking supervision at the ECB, said recently.</td>

That jump in spending shows there is “significant pent-up demand for necessities” while higher-income groups “pulled back the reins” on spending, he said.<br />Other data suggest an improving outlook for consumer spending. Weekly claims for unemployment benefits fell the week ended Feb. 6 to a level well below an early January peak, a sign layoffs are easing. Employers resumed hiring in January, when the unemployment rate declined to 6.3% from 6.7%.

Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.), who voted to acquit.<br />Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican, said as he left the Capitol: “It’s an uncomfortable vote and time will tell, but…I don’t think there was a good outcome there for anybody.” Mr. Thune also voted to acquit Mr. Trump.</td>

She was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump last month on the allegation that he incited the violence at the U.S. Capitol.<br />Then on Friday night, she released a statement detailing a conversation on Jan. 6 between Mr. Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) that she said Mr. McCarthy had relayed to her, helping inform her vote.<br />After an extensive back and forth over whether to call witnesses on Saturday, the House managers and the former president’s counsel agreed to have Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the lead impeachment manager, read Ms. Herrera Beutler’s statement explaining how Mr. McCarthy’s recollection of his call with then-President Trump on Jan. 6 prompted her to vote to impeach Mr. Trump. Mr. Raskin then entered the statement into evidence.<br />In the call, Mr. Trump initially claimed the protesters were linked to antifa, Ms. Herrera Beutler said in her statement, referring to the loose network of antiracist, antifascist protesters.</td>

The suit also alleges David Calhoun, then the lead-director who later became CEO, exaggerated to journalists the degree to which directors attended to safety concerns between and in the wake of the two crashes.<br />The suit alleges that Mr. Calhoun, who became CEO in early 2020, conducted a public-relations campaign that “insisted the board acted with more urgency and was more engaged than it actually had been” following the two crashes that killed 346 people in October 2018 and March 2019.

      <td>Our favorite Valentine’s Day flower was already a symbol of passion in ancient Greek mythology</td>
      <td>Historian Amanda Foreman searches the past for the origins of today’s world. Read previous columns here.<br />“My luve is like a red red rose,/That’s newly sprung in June,” wrote the Scottish poet Robert Burns in 1794, creating an inexhaustible revenue stream for florists everywhere, especially around Valentine’s Day. But why a red rose, you might well ask.<br />Longevity is one reason. The rose is an ancient and well-traveled flower: A 55 million-year-old rose fossil found in Colorado suggests that roses were already blooming when our earliest primate ancestors began populating the earth. If you want to see where it all began, at least in the New World, then a trip to the Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument, roughly two hours’ drive from Denver, should be on your list of things to do once the pandemic is over.<br />In Greek mythology the rose was associated with Aphrodite, goddess of love, who was said to have emerged from the sea in a shower of foam that transformed into white roses. Her son Cupid bribed Harpocrates, the god of silence, with a single rose in return for not revealing his mother’s love affairs, giving rise to the Latin phrase sub rosa, “under the rose,” as a term for secrecy. As for the red rose, it was said to be born of tragedy: Aphrodite became tangled in a rose bush when she ran to comfort her lover Adonis as he lay dying from a wild boar attack. Scratched and torn by its thorns, her feet bled onto the roses and turned them crimson.<br />For the ancient Romans, the rose’s symbolic connection to love and death made it useful for celebrations and funerals alike. A Roman banquet without a suffocating cascade of petals was no banquet at all, and roses were regularly woven into garlands or crushed for their perfume. The first time Mark Antony saw Cleopatra he had to wade through a carpet of rose petals to reach her, by which point he had completely lost his head.</td>

      <td>In an age of political division, plays like ‘Othello’ and ‘The Merchant of Venice’ offer lessons in understanding difference</td>
      <td>The anger and unwillingness of many Americans to listen to those with different opinions is a serious societal problem. But the solution to this toxic state of things must begin on the level of the individual, with the way we listen and speak to relatives, neighbors and colleagues whose views may be diametrically opposed to our own. Lessons for modeling this kind of empathy can be found in literature—above all, in Shakespeare, whose plays are a great antidote to extremism and mean-spiritedness.<br />The renowned literary critic Harold Bloom asserted that Shakespeare “invented the human,” reflected in the rich interior lives of his characters. But it’s not just that Shakespeare’s characters are recognizably human; it is that the plays are constructed to make us more human. They elicit empathy for people whose backgrounds, situations and bodies are different from our own—characters we might otherwise dismiss, dislike or even abhor.<br />“The Merchant of Venice,” written in the late 1590s, was Shakespeare’s breakthrough play in this regard. The plot is principally taken from a 14th-century Italian tale, “Il Pecorone” (“The Simpleton”), about a young merchant who borrows money from a Jewish moneylender and offers a pound of his own flesh as security. But in that story the moneylender is an uninflected villain, while Shylock, the equivalent character in Shakespeare’s play, is given psychological depth and pathos. “Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?” Shylock demands with poignant insistence. He explains that he has been made a villain by the Christian society that mistreats him: “The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.”<br />In “Othello,” Shakespeare extends the same idea into a new context. Othello is a Moorish general in the Venetian army who wins the love of a Venetian noblewoman, Desdemona, with his martial exploits. But Iago, a junior officer, preys on Othello’s insecurity as a Black man in a white society, insinuating that Desdemona’s decision to marry him is “unnatural” in light of her “clime, complexion, and degree.”<br />What is often missed in this play is how much the scheming, villainous Iago is also a target of prejudice. The English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge famously referred to Iago as being driven by “motiveless malignity,” but Shakespeare offers clues that the character’s malevolence is generated by a deep sense of grievance. Iago, a coarse, lower-class soldier, never has a speech like Shylock’s “Hath not a Jew eyes,” but he explains bitterly in the play’s first scene that he is deeply resentful at having been unfairly passed over for promotion: “’Tis the curse of service,/ Preferment goes by letter and affection, /And not by old gradation.” The man promoted in his place is the inexperienced but more refined Cassio, whom Iago convinces Othello is having an affair with Desdemona.</td>

      <td>Lawmakers have sweeping plans to change the foundational covenant between the government and internet platforms. Some experts are cheering, others are wondering if they’ll be burning down the internet rather than saving it.</td>
      <td>Change is likely coming for Section 230, the law that protects online platforms from being held liable for things users say on them. As one of his last acts as president, Donald Trump attempted to strike down the law. President Biden has also said it should be revoked.<br />More than 20 proposals to update Section 230 have surfaced on the Hill, originating from both sides of the aisle. Sens. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and John Thune (R-S.D.), plan to reintroduce one of them, the PACT Act, in the coming weeks, says Sen. Thune. A competing bill was recently proposed by a trio of Democratic U.S. senators on Feb. 5. Its intention, as its backers wrote, is to make social-media companies “accountable for enabling cyberstalking, targeted harassment and discrimination.”<br />There is broad agreement among experts and politicians that Section 230 won’t be eliminated, but that’s where accord ends. While many believe an update of the law is necessary and imminent, many others think most attempts to alter it are dangerous. And despite a flurry of ideas for modernizing the law, it’s not clear where it falls in Congress’s priorities in light of all the other challenges facing the country.<br />The heads of some Big Tech companies, notably  Facebook ’s  Mark Zuckerberg (in October) and  Microsoft ’s  Satya Nadella (on Wednesday) have said they welcome more clarity on what sort of speech should be allowed under Section 230. Meanwhile, Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey on Tuesday proposed a more “market-driven” approach to addressing the desire to update Section 230. Even if legislation is passed, it’s not clear exactly what sort of cases will be brought to test the updated law, or what precedents those decisions will establish. And hashing it out in the courts could take years.<br />“Section 230 touches on everything from election integrity to online social-media bias,” says Klon Kitchen, who was until recently director of the Center for Technology Policy at the politically conservative Heritage Foundation. If we try to solve all the problems of the internet by making changes to this one law, he adds, we’ll be overwhelmed by their unintended consequences.</td>

      <td>National security adviser says it is imperative World Health Organization report be free of China’s intervention</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration issued a formal statement criticizing China over refusing to provide World Health Organization pandemic investigators with data on early Covid-19 cases that could help explain how the virus spread.<br />“We have deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of the Covid-19 investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement issued on Saturday. “It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government.”<br />“To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one, China must make available its data from the earliest days of the outbreak,” Mr. Sullivan said.<br />The WHO investigators are part of a team that this past week completed a monthlong mission in China aimed at determining the origins of the pandemic. Chinese authorities refused requests to provide raw data on 174 cases of Covid-19 that they have identified from the early phase of the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.<br />The Chinese provided their own analysis of data and information, saying that they had found no evidence of the virus. But the WHO team wasn’t allowed to view the raw underlying data on those studies, which could allow them to conduct independent analysis on how early and how extensively the virus began to spread in China, team members told The Wall Street Journal, describing heated conversations.</td>

The agreement is essentially three separate one-year deals, giving Bauer the option to return to the free-agent market after each season. It calls for him averaging $42.5 million in compensation in 2021 and 2022, far surpassing any of his peers.<br />It’s after that when things get really interesting. Bauer’s contract is structured so that it’s unlikely he exercises his option for the third season, making it a three-year deal that really isn’t for three years.</td>

Former President Donald Trump, who often relied on a cadre of informal advisers to inform his decisions, had created one new task force and one new office by the same point in his administration, and former President Barack Obama had set up five new panels.<br />Mr. Biden’s aides and backers say the proliferation of panels—including two unveiled this week to coordinate government efforts on carbon-reduction technologies and to review the national-security aspects of the administration’s China strategy—demonstrates a deliberative approach to governing that seeks to incorporate expert input.<br />“This is how a normal administration operates,” said Chris Lu, who managed Mr. Obama’s first-term cabinet. “It brings together experts from inside and outside the government to provide the best advice in order to solve big problems.”</td>

But the firms’ nondisclosure of the agreement with the members of the Sackler family who own Purdue, and whose interests are at odds with company creditors, skirted bankruptcy rules meant to reveal potential conflicts of interest, bankruptcy experts said.<br />Earlier this week, Michael Quinn, a lawyer representing five people with wrongful death and personal injury claims against Purdue, questioned whether the 2018 defense agreement restricted what Skadden and WilmerHale could disclose to creditors as they have probed whether they can recover billions of dollars from the drugmaker’s owners. Even though the law firms have represented Purdue for years, they have additional obligations to company creditors while the company is in chapter 11.<br />A separate committee of Purdue creditors has been probing the transfer of billions of dollars from Purdue to the Sacklers before the company filed bankruptcy, according to court documents. The committee is examining if these roughly $10 billion in transfers to the Sacklers can be recovered for the benefit of Purdue creditors, court papers say. Mr. Quinn said in his letter he is concerned that the obligation in the defense agreement to keep Sackler information confidential conflicted with Skadden’s and WilmerHale’s duties in bankruptcy to Purdue and its creditors.<br />The Sacklers have consistently denied throughout the bankruptcy case that the transfers were improper and said more than half the money was used to pay taxes or invested in international ventures. However, they offered to cede control of Purdue and pay a $3 billion cash settlement to resolve creditor claims against them.</td>

Mr. Biden’s campaign website said he would make a priority of passing a law against domestic terrorism “that respects free speech and civil liberties,” though it is unclear if that would entail creating a broad statute. The Biden administration has yet to make any recommendations and is considering civil-rights concerns, a senior administration official said earlier in February.<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation can robustly monitor international terrorists with the goal of disrupting plots before they occur.

They all have their cameras on. When Ms. Anderson’s fourth-grade daughter received her report card recently, there was a note from the teacher saying she seems distracted during class.<br />“I’m getting chastised for a distracted environment?” said Ms. Anderson, of Eugene, Ore., who teaches college students online. “I’m not going to have my young children alone in their rooms doing their work. There is no winning solution.”<br />Districts were hesitant to make cameras a requirement in the fall, out of respect for family privacy. Besides increasing anxiety for some kids, the live look into students’ living quarters—not only by teachers, but also by fellow students—might pose equity issues.<br />As students enter the midway slump of a trying school year, after months of full or partial remote learning, more districts around the country are requiring students to turn on their cameras. While educators have seen positive results in grades and participation, the debate continues.</td>

      <td>The tech-bro uniform is on its way out. Here’s how a new generation of women in tech is changing the status quo, starting with what they wear.</td>
      <td>Off Brand is a thrice-monthly column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />EVERYONE KNOWS what the male tech-bro uniform is. Lowly software engineers and island-buying titans alike favor jeans, sweatshirts and sneakers in faded shades of  Twitter -blue and Windows-gray. Casualness is a club for men in Silicon Valley, and dressing down is the secret handshake. In “Uncanny Valley,” Anna Wiener’s 2020 memoir of 2010s San Francisco startup life, she wrote, “Bars were overrun with men in their twenties wearing corporate-branded T-shirts...Men who wore stability running shoes to nightclubs.”<br />For women—who still fill fewer than 25% of technical roles at the leading tech companies as reported by Statista—navigating fashion is a minefield. Vinthujah Balasubramaniam, a 29-year-old founder of a start-up in Montreal and product manager at a tech company, said that the latter’s CEO dresses in a hoodie and shorts, and what is emphasized is “the value that you deliver as a person.” As a result of this culture, she said, her “idea of what a professional outfit is has changed.”<br />Historically, women navigating a career in tech cope by gravitating toward one of two extremes. Some do their best to blend in with the male engineers in cotton sweatshirts, drab slim pants and washable sneaker-ish Rothy’s flats. Meanwhile women in financing, sales and leadership positions often adopt full Ted-Talk looks, assembling outfits from brightly colored designer pieces. During Marissa Mayer’s stint as Yahoo’s CEO, a Vogue writer called her “an unusually stylish geek” in a 2013 article. The HBO show “Silicon Valley” satirized the binary choice these two tracks represent: female-engineer characters lurked in the background in slouching jeans, while the show’s VC execs wore sleek power dresses.<br />But, beyond just fitting in, what about personal taste or expression? Today, a small but significant subsection of women in tech is challenging the status quo of the industry’s dress codes. They’re wearing tops with exaggerated proportions, androgynous pantsuits in sorbet shades, and unapologetically large earrings. This rebellion might reflect geographical splintering: Covid has all but erased those mythological Bay Area campuses where worker bees gathered hoodie-to-hoodie to eat kale in the sunshine. Or perhaps it’s due to the strengthening of social networks on TikTok and Instagram, where women in tech connect via Instagram and Tiktok handles and hashtags like “womenintech” and “stemschicks.”</td>

      <td>There’s hardly a more rewarding aspect of travel than strolling a new locale, like a modern-day flâneur. The experience is especially sweet when you see something unexpectedly stunning, as I did some years ago in Riga, Latvia. I knew about its Art Nouveau district, yet when I came upon Albert Street, lined with pastel-hued buildings festooned with faces, figures, peacocks, flowers and other Art Nouveau motifs, I was stopped in my tracks by their beauty.<br />Paris, Brussels and Barcelona are famous for their elegant, undulating Art Nouveau architectural treasures, but this style, which thrived from about 1890 to 1910, is prominent throughout Europe, in big cities and small towns alike. Many can be explored online—starting with Riga, which claims to have the largest concentration of Art Nouveau buildings in the world.<br />The Riga Art Nouveau Museum is particularly memorable. Once the home of architect Konstantīns Pēkšēns, it has a graceful façade decorated with plant and animal designs. The interior, including its spiral staircase—a delightful match of swirling and geometric patterns on the banister and the walls along the way—has been restored, room by room, to its glory days in the early 20th century, viewable in a photo gallery on the website. History tells us why that was needed: These beautiful rooms were requisitioned for communal housing during the Soviet occupation, each one assigned to a separate family.<br />To see other Art Nouveau edifices, you might start with a 55-minute documentary on YouTube called “Art Nouveau Without Borders.” Partly funded by the European Union, this video focuses on cities in the Danube River basin, making stops from Vienna to Oradea, Romania. Well-narrated, the film briefly relates how Art Nouveau, which celebrates natural forms, originated in reaction and opposition to the stilted academic style of the 19th century. It also tells viewers the monikers used for the style in different countries, such as Jugendstil in Germany, Secession in Austria and Arte Joven in Spain; provides the names of leading architects; and showcases very impressive buildings, pausing at times for interviews with art historians.<br />The video visits well-known examples of Art Nouveau, particularly in Vienna. There’s the white-cube Secession building, topped by a brilliant gold dome of laurel leaves, and the gorgeous Church of St. Leopold, whose white and gold interior is crowned by a mosaic depicting the ascension of souls into heaven.</td>

Along with arms sales and the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen, it includes an assessment of whether the U.S. has done enough to hold Saudi officials accountable for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and other aspects of the two countries’ ties, U.S. officials said.<br />During his campaign, Mr. Biden called Saudi Arabia a “pariah.” Since then, the new administration has struck a different tone, stressing the U.S. will help defend the kingdom against attacks from Iranian-backed forces in the region, even while calling for an end to the civil war in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia intervened in 2015.<br />While relations have frayed over the past decade, Washington and Riyadh still need each other on multiple fronts, from grappling with Iran to coordinating counterterrorism and energy policies, the current and former officials said.<br />“It’s pretty hard to envision any kind of a strategy in the region that can work if the Saudis aren’t some part of it,” said Dennis Ross, who served in key Mideast roles under Republican and Democratic presidents.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—House Democrats and Donald Trump’s defense team are preparing for closing arguments Saturday on charges that he incited last month’s riot at the Capitol, in what are expected to be abbreviated remarks before a final vote on whether to convict the former president.<br />The Democrats, led by Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, and Mr. Trump’s lawyers will each have two hours to wrap up their cases. The defense team said it plans to use only half its time.<br />Many Republican and Democratic senators sitting as jurors have said they have largely made up their minds, essentially ensuring Mr. Trump’s acquittal in his second impeachment trial and the fourth presidential impeachment trial in American history. In a vote Tuesday on the constitutionality of trying a former president on impeachment charges, only six Republicans sided with the chamber’s 50 Democrats. It would take 67 votes to convict Mr. Trump.<br />With the outcome not in doubt, the question will be how many Republicans join Democrats in voting to convict. Much of the focus was on Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.), who on Friday was photographed studying notes that said “the House managers did not connect the dots” between Mr. Trump’s Jan. 6 speech and his supporters’ attack on the Capitol, resulting in the deaths of five people including a Capitol Police officer. Mr. Cassidy later said that was one of two news releases his staff had prepared—one for each position—and that he still hasn’t made up his mind.<br />Also at issue was whether either side would attempt to subpoena witnesses or enter new evidence. Senators of both parties have said they didn’t need to hear from witnesses, which would require lengthy depositions, prolonging a trial that both Republicans and Democrats have said they want to wrap up.</td>

Together, the roughly 300 civil liberties lawsuits related to Covid-19 represent the most significant test in more than a century of the emergency powers of state governors and the scope of liberty in dire times.<br />A review of rulings on emergency measures shows that federal and state courts have been reluctant to second-guess governors, upholding widespread restrictions on travel, gatherings and commerce. On the federal bench, judges appointed by Republican presidents were less deferential, but overall, the courts have given more weight to the government’s interest in controlling disease than to the rights of individuals and business owners.<br />When judges did push back against state orders, their sharpest scrutiny was reserved for restrictions on religious worship and abortion access.</td>

That progress—highlighted in cockpits managed primarily by computers, totally autonomous helicopters and automated aerial-refueling tankers—is likely to show up in future civilian aircraft, advanced air-traffic-control systems and a range of drone applications.<br />Skeptics worry automated systems sometimes reflect software developers’ desire to incorporate new capabilities without full testing. They point to examples of high-profile stumbles ranging from glitch-prone radio communication systems to software problems that have deprived pilots of adequate oxygen at the controls of jet fighters.<br />Unlike commercial automation, “there aren’t any regulators or outsiders to scrutinize Pentagon efforts,” said Najmedin Meshkati, a human-factors expert who teaches at the University of Southern California. “You really have to do your homework before integrating emerging new applications with older technology.”<br />But already, programs meant to supplement and eventually replace human operators are accelerating in every branch of the U.S. armed services.</td>

      <td>Airlines had opposed such a measure; CDC reiterated guidance that Americans refrain from travel</td>
      <td>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday it won’t currently recommend mandatory Covid-19 testing before domestic air travel, a proposal it had been weighing but met with strong objections from the airline industry.<br />“At this time, CDC is not recommending required point of departure testing for domestic travel,” the CDC said. “As part of our close monitoring of the pandemic, in particular the continued spread of variants, we will continue to review public health options for containing and mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the travel space.”<br />The CDC announcement comes after chief executives of major U.S. carriers—including  American Airlines Group Inc.,   United Airlines Holdings Inc.  and  Southwest Airlines Co. —met on Friday with White House officials. The meeting included Jeffrey Zients, who is coordinating the administration’s Covid-19 response.<br />The CDC didn’t offer an explanation for its decision and reiterated existing guidance urging the public not to travel amid the pandemic. In its statement, the CDC emphasized that people should still get tested before and after traveling and self-quarantine for at least seven days post-travel to reduce risk.<br />Airlines had broadly supported the international testing rules imposed by the Biden administration last month, but balked at the prospect of mandatory testing prior to domestic flights, fearing that it would crush already-depressed appetite for travel.</td>

      <td>Key moments and themes as Trump’s lawyers mounted their defense</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The fourth day of the Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump offered a chance for his lawyers to dispute Democrats’ charge that Mr. Trump was responsible for the riot that took place on Jan. 6. Then senators were permitted to ask both sides follow-up questions. Here are eight takeaways from Friday:<br />Mr. Trump’s defense team called Democrats’ allegations that he incited the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot “patently absurd.” “No thinking person could seriously believe that the president’s Jan. 6 speech on the Ellipse was in any way an incitement to violence or insurrection,” Trump lawyer Michael van der Veen said. He called the impeachment trial another part of a “witch hunt” by Democrats.<br />The defense team aired several montages of quick-cut footage of Democratic lawmakers using the word “fight,” arguing that Mr. Trump’s use of the word on Jan. 6 wasn’t unusual and is standard political fare. The video also included now-President Biden saying if he were in high school he would take Mr. Trump “behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.” Other clips the defense used were on the milder side, including a clip of Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia vowing to keep up the fight in a speech about mine workers’ health and retirement benefits. “Spare us the hypocrisy and false indignation,” said Mr. van der Veen. Democrats said the presentation made a false equivalence.<br />One of the defense team’s lawyers, Bruce L. Castor Jr., said Mr. Trump’s supporters couldn’t have taken his speech on Jan. 6 as a call for political violence because he was only urging members of Congress to fight to keep him in power—or else face primary challenges for re-election. “Listening to it as you have here, unedited by us, is it possible that President Trump’s disdain for political violence could be any clearer to the persons listening as he was speaking? Is it possible that his words could have been misunderstood?” Mr. Castor said. “I suggest to you that is impossible.”<br />Another of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, David Schoen, accused House Democrats of manipulating evidence and showing selectively edited videos and images during their presentation. A senior aide to the Democratic impeachment managers said that they had to re-create a tweet—because Mr. Trump’s  Twitter  account had been taken down—and there was an extraneous check mark but the text was the same. The Democrats said the defense’s accusation about selective video editing was false and accused Mr. Trump’s team of the same thing.</td>

      <td>The Louisiana Republican, a prolific note-taker during the proceedings, is a surprise swing vote</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Sen. Bill Cassidy emerged this week as a wild card in the trial over whether former President Donald Trump incited the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, and he said Friday he still hasn’t made up his mind.<br />The Louisiana Republican surprised colleagues Tuesday when he voted with Democrats to assert the constitutionality of the trial and move ahead with the proceedings. Headed into the final days of the case, he has walked a fine line. He said that he has found the Democrats’ arguments compelling and had questions for Mr. Trump’s lawyers. But he also has insisted that his recent action didn’t indicate whether he would vote to convict Mr. Trump.<br />“The American people are counting on us actually coming to this with a mind ready to receive information,” Mr. Cassidy said. “And, yes there’s people on both sides of it who want your mind made up right now. But there’s a lot at stake here.”<br />Mr. Cassidy didn’t state his position Friday. He was photographed reviewing notes of a document that appeared to point toward acquittal, but later said it was one of two press releases his staff had prepared for each position. “If I had flipped the page, you would have had the one going the other way,” he said.<br />The notes he held read: “the House managers did not connect the dots to show President Trump knew that the attack on the Capitol was going to be violent and result in the loss of life.”</td>

      <td>Four pharmaceutical companies in settlement talks with states to resolve claims related to their involvement in the national opioid crisis stand to reap about $1 billion each in tax breaks if a combined payout of more than $26 billion is finalized, according to company filings.<br />The drug distributors  McKesson Corp. ,  AmerisourceBergen Corp.  and  Cardinal Health Inc.,  along with  Johnson & Johnson ,  plan to deduct the payouts from their taxes, filings show.<br />Cardinal, which expects to pay $6.6 billion as part of the settlement, said in a regulatory filing earlier this month that it anticipates receiving a $943 million tax benefit as a result of losses it incurred because of the payout charge. The company said it has filed for an income tax refund it expects to receive in the next 12 months.<br />Cardinal, based in Dublin, Ohio, said $420 million of the benefit would come from offsetting profits from prior tax years when there was a higher corporate income-tax rate, taking advantage of a provision created by Congress as part of its Covid-19 economic-relief package last March<br />“We recorded a net operating loss for tax purposes in our second quarter, which, as permissible under current federal law, will be carried back to recover previously paid federal taxes,” a Cardinal spokeswoman said in an email.</td>

      <td>Braving traffickers and angry seas, Sadeka found herself trapped on a remote island; ‘all the women here’ think about suicide</td>
      <td>In mid-March, Sadeka Bibi set off with a small bundle of her belongings for an unmarked spot on the side of a road in southeast Bangladesh, filled at once with hope and fear.<br />A truck would meet her there, drive her to a place near the shore about an hour south, and she’d get on a boat that would ferry her illegally to Malaysia, where a man she had never met was waiting to marry her.<br />She knew it was dangerous. The boat could capsize. She could be beaten, starved or extorted by human traffickers. She could die. Or, like the 10 previous attempts she had made to get across, her escape could be thwarted by rough seas or border authorities. Still, to Sadeka, a 21-year-old Rohingya refugee from Myanmar, making the journey seemed like the only way for a fresh start.<br />It was either that or languish behind barbed wire, potentially for the rest of her life, in the world’s largest refugee camp, her immediate family scattered across three countries.<br />Sadeka’s story is the Rohingya’s in microcosm. Driven to the brink of destruction by rampaging soldiers, human traffickers and hostile governments, a community that was once believed to have numbered well over a million in Myanmar has been sundered, not by a single action, but by a series of blows that have left a people with no place to call home.</td>
