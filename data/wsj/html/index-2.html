      <td>Conservative banker defeats protégé of leftist ex-president Rafael Correa, setting the country on pro-business path</td>
      <td>Ecuador on Sunday elected a conservative former banker and supporter of free-market policies as president over his populist opponent, setting the country on a pro-business path.<br />Guillermo Lasso, 65 years old, received over 52% of the vote to clinch the presidency, his third attempt at running for office. He defeated Andrés Arauz, a 36-year-old leftist economist and protégé of powerful ex-president Rafael Correa. Mr. Arauz conceded with more than 95% of votes counted.<br />Mr. Lasso will inherit a bruised economy and health crisis as the Covid-19 pandemic rages across South America. From Brazil to Peru and Chile, hospitals are being pushed to the brink as infections surge to record levels, crimping hopes for an economic rebound.<br />“For years, I’ve dreamed about the possibility of serving Ecuadoreans, so the country progresses. Today, you’ve made that possible,” Mr. Lasso said to cheering supporters. “We’ll build a more just country, with more prosperity for everyone.”<br />While voters in Ecuador chose a right-wing candidate, in the first round of presidential voting in neighboring Peru voters appeared to go to the far left. An Ipsos exit poll showed presidential candidate Pedro Castillo, a socialist who favors undoing three decades of market-friendly policies, leading a field of 17 other candidates. Peru will hold a second round vote in June between the top two finishers.</td>

He won by one stroke with a 10-under par performance for the tournament that overcame a serious wobble down the stretch.  He could finally exhale and slip into a green jacket.<br />The victory completed the rise of a 29-year-old who burst onto the scene at this very course a decade ago and became one of the sport’s bright young talents and one of Asia’s all-time greats even before this win that quickly vacillated between near certitude and epic disaster.<br />“Hopefully, I’ll be a pioneer,” Matsuyama said afterward.</td>

Cafe Studios charges subscribers for access to exclusive podcasts, a business model that Mr. Bankoff said he is interested in exploring.<br />“Vox Media is a company that is built on talented, creative people who connect and create authority and community with large audiences,” Mr. Bankoff said. “And that’s precisely what Preet and the Cafe team have done.”</td>

      <td>Churches play a vital role sheltering migrants, who are overwhelming U.S. and Mexican authorities.</td>
      <td>Matamoros, Mexico<br />‘Americans don’t know how this country is, Mexico,” Yaimin Fuentes Caña says. “The Mexicans extort Cubans, Hondurans, anyone who comes here to this country. This country is super violent.”<br />The 38-year-old migrant speaks from experience. He says he fled Cuba after authorities roughed him up because he refused to participate in the communist dictatorship’s sham elections. He requested protection in the U.S., but under the Trump administration’s Migrant Protection Protocols, asylum seekers were required to wait in Mexico for their cases to be adjudicated. Mr. Fuentes Caña says that since he arrived in Matamoros in May 2019, he’s been kidnapped several times and released only after paying the cartels a ransom. Corrupt officials and criminals extort migrants every chance they get, he says, and the cartels also pressure migrants to pay up for a coyote and enter the U.S. illegally: “Imagine: Who doesn’t pay, doesn’t last. You never see them again.”<br />Mr. Fuentes Caña finally found refuge at a seminary turned shelter in Matamoros, supported by Texan Christians. It’s one of dozens that have sprung up on both sides of the border to help with the unfolding humanitarian crisis. These makeshift shelters provide migrants with food, a bed, showers—and a modicum of protection against the corrupt officials, cartels and criminals who are making a fortune exploiting those fleeing persecution or seeking a better life in America. To the benefit of migrants, many of these rogues get superstitious about meddling with churches and their ministries.<br />President Biden is phasing out the Migrant Protection Protocols and gradually admitting asylum seekers who enrolled in the program. Mr. Fuentes Caña is still waiting for his turn to enter the U.S. legally, and he’s determined to abide by the law because he wants to reunite someday with his wife and five children, whom he left behind in Cuba. But the pastors I interviewed said other migrants misinterpreted Mr. Biden’s policy as a sign that the U.S. border is now open to them.</td>

      <td>The progressive goal is a House-like body run by big-state majorities.</td>
      <td>Between the drive to eliminate the legislative filibuster and the campaign to add new states for partisan advantage, the U.S. Senate hasn’t been under this much political pressure since the passage of the 17th Amendment (on the direct election of Senators) in 1913. The enduring influence and legitimacy of America’s legislative upper house has long distinguished the U.S. from many less stable democracies. But a new majoritarian ideology threatens to upend that achievement.<br />As early as this week a House committee will advance a partisan and constitutionally suspect bill to add Senators by making Washington, D.C., the 51st state. The Senate’s traditional 60-vote requirement to pass legislation hangs by a thread. A great deal has been written about the merits of both issues, but it’s wrong to see them in isolation. They are political manifestations of a fundamental challenge to the Senate as an institution that is worth understanding—and repudiating—in its own right.<br />Debate over the Senate’s structure—two Senators for each state, regardless of population—is as old as the nation. At the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, delegates from the larger states, especially in the South, wanted Senate seats apportioned according to population. They were outvoted, as smaller states like New Jersey didn’t want to forfeit their influence in the new federal government the Constitution created. The large states’ size would be reflected in the House of Representatives. This Great Compromise was essential to the Constitution’s ratification.<br />The design became a part of America’s civil religion. As James Madison (a large-stater at the convention) wrote in the Federalist, equal state representation in the Senate would guard “against an improper consolidation of the States into one simple republic.” The ability of states like Florida and New York, or Wyoming and Delaware, to pursue different policies remains a vital outlet for America’s national partisan divisions.<br />Yet today, like so many other features of the Constitution, the Senate’s equal weighting of states finds itself under siege in the press and academy. “Minority rule” has become a buzzword among pundits calling for smashing the filibuster and expanding the Senate.</td>

      <td>A new report shows how the prolonged school shutdown has hurt kids.</td>
      <td>Americans are only beginning to understand the damage from keeping so many students out of the classroom for the past year. It’s the greatest outrage of the pandemic, and maybe the most destructive. A new report by the nonprofit Great Public Schools Now quantifies the harm so far to children in the Los Angeles Unified School District.<br />L.A. schools will finally begin opening this week after more than a year of distance learning, though educational offerings will still be far from normal. Despite overwhelming evidence that it is safe for children to attend class in-person, the teachers union has long resisted a return to the classroom and issued over-the-top demands. Throughout the fall 2020 semester, the report notes, elementary-school students in L.A. received fewer than two hours a day of synchronous instruction on average—less than half as much as in the Long Beach and San Diego school districts.<br />The L.A. district considers students engaged merely for logging on to the online teaching platform. Yet even by this low standard, the Great Public Schools Now report finds that “over 13,000 middle and high school students were consistently disengaged in fall 2020,” and “an additional 56,000 did not actively participate on a daily basis.” In January and February, some 22,800 students missed three or more days of class a week.<br />During the 2020-2021 school year, 37% of Los Angeles kindergartners exhibited basic literacy skills, compared to 57% a year before. A fall 2020 assessment showed that only one in three middle- and high-school students displayed grade-level reading and math skills.<br />The learning losses are especially acute among poor and minority students. The report raises alarms about “a surge in the percentage of students receiving Ds and Fs in fall 2020, with students of color and students from low-income houses experiencing the highest number of failing grades.”</td>

      <td>Producer prices rise 1% in March as supply-side constraints bite.</td>
      <td>Congratulations to those who want higher inflation. You’ve got it. The U.S. on Friday reported a rise of 1% in producer prices for March, double the consensus prediction of economists. Prices are up 4.2% in the last year, with goods prices up 7%.<br />The year-over-year increase is higher in part because of low, pandemic-induced numbers from 2020. The recent acceleration is also related to constraints on the supply of goods, while demand surges as the pandemic eases and consumers spend their pent-up savings and government checks.<br />For these reasons, Federal Reserve economists say inflation will be “transitory,” receding later this year as supply constraints ease. Let’s hope they’re right. But the Fed may also be underestimating the impact of its wide-open monetary policies despite an economy that will boom as the pandemic lockdowns end and the jobless rate continues to fall at a rapid rate.<br />The yield on the 10-year Treasury note popped to 1.66% on Friday, though down from its peak for the day. Investors will be watching Tuesday’s report on consumer prices for more inflation clues. The U.S. has never before pursued government-spending and monetary expansion of this magnitude with a hot economy, and the Fed says it will wait for durable inflation to appear before changing. Good luck.</td>

      <td>Dozens of chief executives and other senior leaders gathered on Zoom this weekend to plot what several said big businesses should do next about new voting laws under way in Texas and other states.<br />Kenneth Chenault, the former chief executive of  American Express Co. , and Kenneth Frazier, CEO of  Merck  & Co., urged the leaders to collectively call for greater voting access, according to several people who attended. Messrs. Chenault and Frazier cautioned businesses against dropping the issue and asked CEOs to sign a statement opposing what they view as discriminatory legislation on voting, the people said.<br />A statement could come early this week, the people said, and would build on one that 72 Black executives signed last month in the wake of changes to Georgia’s voting laws. Mr. Chenault told executives on the call that several leaders had signaled they would sign on, including executives at  PepsiCo Inc.,   PayPal  Holdings Inc.,  T. Rowe Price Group Inc.  and  Hess Corp. , among others, according to the people. PayPal confirmed it has signed the statement. PepsiCo, T. Rowe Price and Hess didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.<br />As more companies and their leaders have spoken out on the issue in recent weeks, their stands have drawn the ire of Republican state and federal legislators who say companies are miscasting the matter and shouldn’t act as shadow lawmakers. Meanwhile, progressive activists and others who oppose the laws have said that the actions leaders are taking aren’t strong enough. Many CEOs now feel a duty, or pressure, to make their views explicitly known to employees and others, executive advisers said.<br />Plenty of companies remain wary of wading into politically charged areas. One executive from a Fortune 100 consumer-products company said board members, employees and vendors are pressing leaders to speak out, but doing so could put a bull’s-eye on the company.</td>

      <td>Digital proof would allow Americans to visit family in the hospital, not keep folks out of restaurants.</td>
      <td>The idea of a “vaccine passport,” which would let people prove they’re inoculated against Covid, has been swept up in a political debate over personal liberty. But this misunderstands how these apps are likely to be used. Passports would empower consumers by giving them more control over their own health information.<br />Millions of Americans now have index cards noting their vaccine lots and dates. But your doctor and health plan don’t necessarily have that information. The card could get lost and is easy to forge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requires states to maintain databases as a condition of vaccine shipments. But there are more than 60 separate systems—some large states like Texas have a few, and New York City has its own. The record system uses an existing arrangement for childhood-vaccination programs: It was set up years ago so pediatricians can ask these sites for records that a child has been vaccinated.<br />The federal government needed to set up a record system quickly, before the country could reach a consensus about how consumers should store this information. Instead, states were asked to work off of the existing system with no obvious plan for consumer access; the priority was getting shots in arms.<br />In some cases, health plans are notified that you have received a vaccine, at least if you volunteer your insurance card when vaccinated. But that doesn’t help the millions who are uninsured or get the shot at a mass vaccination site or other nonstandard place like an optometrist’s office.<br />As a result, there’s no easy way to prove you’ve been vaccinated. You’d need cryptographically signed data that can’t easily be forged—a digital card that enables you to retrieve and store testing and vaccination information in a secure and verifiable way, via either an app or a QR code.</td>

      <td>It prevented Southern senators from blocking debate and created the conditions for consensus.</td>
      <td>The debate over the future of the Senate’s legislative filibuster has focused on the simple use of majority power to crush the opposition. While the future of America’s bicameral legislature and the balance of power created by the Founders is riding on this debate, many have lost sight of the true nature and value of the Senate, an institution that takes time and requires compromise to find long-term answers to major issues. Critics have linked the filibuster to Jim Crow segregation, but the tactic actually played a crucial role in passing civil-rights legislation and ensuring it was accepted by the South.<br />Rule 22, which establishes a procedure called “cloture” to end a filibuster, was created to provide a way to close debate with support of a supermajority in the Senate and move to pass legislation. The rule protected the minority’s rights while allowing a compromise to be achieved that would ultimately result in legislation being passed.<br />For the first 47 years after Rule 22’s enactment in 1917, there were only five successful attempts to cut off debate in the U.S. Senate. A few senators felt so strongly about their right to extended debate that they vowed never to vote for cloture, even for legislation they supported.<br />There were several successful filibusters of civil-rights legislation between 1917 and 1964. But after President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, President Lyndon B. Johnson decided to make the Civil Rights Act his chief legislative priority. He worked with Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Minority Leader Everett Dirksen to maneuver the bill through the challenges of senators who planned to filibuster.<br />It began with Mansfield meeting with Georgia Democrat Richard Russell, the leader of the senators opposed to the Civil Rights Act. Mansfield promised there would be no tricks and he would keep Russell fully informed of Mansfield’s actions as he guided the bill through floor debate. Some insisted the bill should be driven through and passed as quickly as possible, but Mansfield treated every senator equally and fairly. He believed legislation should be addressed “not in the seeking of short-cuts, not in the cracking of nonexistent whips, not in wheeling and dealing, but in an honest facing of the situation and a resolution of it by the Senate itself.”</td>

      <td>The Chinese Communist Party recently imposed sanctions against us for our work on the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. It’s part of a desperate attempt to silence international scrutiny of Beijing’s abysmal human-rights record, particularly its genocidal policies against the Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang and its persecution of other religious minorities.<br />We won’t be intimidated or silenced. We appreciate Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s support, and we are proud that USCIRF has long been at the forefront in exposing the Communist Party’s egregious religious-freedom violations. In fact, we’re flattered by the Chinese government’s recognition for our work in defending religious freedom in China, as we join an increasing list of courageous American, European and other officials on whom the party has likewise applied sanctions for standing up to a regime that has violated its obligations under the Genocide Convention.<br />Meanwhile, Beijing’s threats gave us a glimpse into the state-led oppression under which so many Uighurs, Tibetans, Christians, Falun Gong practitioners and others are forced to live.<br />Given the Communist Party’s oppression at home and increasing aggression abroad, we must continue to stand with our partners to expose, condemn and hold the Chinese government accountable. Beijing’s belligerent rhetoric and actions demonstrate that international criticism and scrutiny of its human-rights record are effective. Genocide and crimes against humanity are deeply damaging to China’s image and undermine its ambition to project itself as a global power.<br />The Communist’s Party’s hostile actions are also counterproductive. They’re helping solidify a coalition of governments to counter such aggression. In this regard, this international coalition should take several immediate actions. Congress should pass the Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which creates a “rebuttable presumption” that bans all goods exported from Xinjiang. The U.S. government and like-minded partners should continue to impose targeted sanctions on Chinese agencies and officials responsible for severe violations of religious freedom and human rights.</td>

But the league’s practice of engaging with the Castros as if the regime were normal has had the opposite effect. It has added to the isolation of Cuban dissidents.<br />San Isidro’s brave musicians, performance artists, writers and intellectuals, who are overwhelmingly people of color, are a prime example. They have to work extra hard against the myth, strengthened by years of major-league complicity, that Fidel and Raúl Castro ended social injustices, including the marginalization of black Cubans.<br />As recently as 2018, Major League Baseball sought a deal with Raúl under which Havana would send players to the U.S. and baseball would garnish their salaries and send the dollars back to the dictatorship—as if the players were the regime’s property rather than the teams’ employees.</td>

Along the way, he tries to show why they are so widespread. His focus is on “the allure of fad psychology,” as he puts it, and on the ways in which “both individuals and institutions can do a better job of resisting it.”<br />We all remember the self-esteem programs that beguiled grade-school educators in the 1980s and 1990s. The idea was that, by handing out more prizes and encouraging self-affirming rhetoric, young people would do better in their studies and in life generally. But, as Mr. Singal notes, self-esteem failed to “ ‘unlock the gates’ of success.” Nor did it help to reduce—as promised—crime, teen pregnancy and a host of other social ills.<br />Then there was power-posing for women in the workplace: the claim that, by adopting assertive positions (legs astride, hands on hips) for two minutes before, say, going into a job interview, or while giving a presentation, a new confidence will be engendered as well as an improved status among otherwise dismissive men. A TED talk by an originator of power-posing and its chief evangelist, a Harvard psychologist, garnered 61 million views. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook was a fan. But it turned out that standing like Wonder Woman didn’t give women the promised testosterone boost and confidence they sought.<br />A MacArthur Fellowship-winning social psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania championed a mental trait called “grit” (aka stick-to-itiveness). Teaching “grit” became a wildly popular way to build character or boost grades in school-aged children across the country. It didn’t deliver. As Mr. Singal notes, established concepts such as conscientiousness and IQ were far better at predicting performance.</td>

In Washington, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council declined to comment.<br />Iran and the remaining five parties to the 2015 nuclear accord converged in Vienna last week to negotiate a road map for the U.S. to return to the agreement, which the Trump administration left in 2018. Their objective is to find a way for President Biden’s administration to lift sanctions on Iran if Tehran agrees to comply with the 2015 pact, which was developed to curtail the growth of Iran’s nuclear capability, and keep it from developing nuclear-weapons technology.</td>

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal are forecasting a 40% annual increase, a sharp reversal from the 6.6% contraction in the year-earlier period. Similar to the exports, the country’s import sector is expected to see 25% growth in March, reversing a year-earlier decline of 0.9%.<br />U.S. consumer prices are expected to pick up in March, a potential signal of building inflation pressures amid a big dose of fiscal stimulus, rising consumer spending and supply-chain bottlenecks. Most policy makers and many economists, however, are forecasting that relatively strong consumer-price gains will be short-lived.<br />Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks virtually to the Economic Club of Washington. Mr. Powell is likely to maintain the central bank’s mantra on inflation—that any upward pressure on consumer prices from fiscal stimulus “will be neither particularly large nor persistent.”</td>

Mr. Biden said last week he planned to meet with Republicans, beginning Monday, in an effort to see where common ground can be found.

But some Democrats have also aired disagreements over the size and makeup of the proposal, meaning party leaders face a challenge keeping the rank and file in line.</td>

Adding a loose structure to each day, allotting certain types of activities to mornings or afternoons, “gives you focus and patterns to work from.

The bill would make it easier for gig workers and other independent contractors to unionize and set an enforceable timeline for union-employer negotiations to commence.

Those surveyed by The Wall Street Journal boosted their average forecast for 2021 economic growth to 6.4%, measured as the change in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. If realized, that would be one of the few times in 70 years that the economy has grown so fast.<br />“We had an incredible shock, but look how fast we’re bouncing back,” said Allen Sinai, chief global economist and strategist at Decision Economics Inc. “We’re in the early stages of recovery, and we’ve got three to five years to go. I think we’re going to end up in a boom.”<br />Economists expect growth to slow to 3.2% next year, which would still make 2021-22 the strongest two-year performance since 2005.<br />That boom might have a potentially troubling side effect. Inflation, as measured by the consumer-price index, is expected to jump sharply from 1.7% in February when March data is released Tuesday.

      <td>Too many people leave work too early or too late. It doesn’t have to be this way.</td>
      <td>It’s one of the most-important decisions many of us will ever make. And we often get it wrong.<br />I’m talking about retirement—and specifically, when to do it. If you are lucky enough to be able to determine your own retirement date, be grateful that this change is not being forced upon you. But also be aware that it isn’t a simple decision. Many of us know friends who thought they were emotionally ready but later regretted having retired. And we know colleagues who thought they were not ready, and then got sick or died young, filled with regret that they had missed out on a phase of life that could have been wonderful.<br />It doesn’t have to be this way. After seeing hundreds of individuals and couples in psychotherapy over many years, and writing a book on retirement, I believe that retirement-timing mistakes can be the exception rather than the rule. The key is to know what questions to ask yourself—and how to understand the answers.<br />To that end, here are eight questions that I think can make all the difference.<br />1. Every Sunday night, as I anticipate returning to work, do I look forward to finishing tasks, seeing friends and colleagues, and perhaps learning something new? Or do I dread another week of tedious tasks and difficult people?</td>

      <td>Champions of the accelerating push for solar energy around the world are confronting a previously overlooked challenge: The industry’s supply chains are heavily reliant on Xinjiang, a Chinese region the U.S. government and others say is the scene of genocide against local ethnic minorities including the mostly Muslim Uyghur inhabitants.<br />About half the world’s supply of polysilicon, an essential ingredient in most solar panels, comes from this part of northwestern China, where human-rights groups and U.S. officials say China runs a sprawling network of internment camps that the U.S. says have held more than 1 million Uyghurs, a Muslim minority group.<br />Some in the renewable-energy industry say they fear that polysilicon and other essential materials that come from Xinjiang could have links to forced labor. And lack of unrestricted access to Xinjiang means it is difficult to ensure suppliers aren’t somehow linked to human-rights abuses.<br />Global pressure to curb trade with Xinjiang is building. Both the U.S. and the European Union are weighing legislation that could lead to import bans on more products from the region, including polysilicon. The U.S. already banned imports of Xinjiang-produced cotton and tomatoes in January.<br />Many Western solar companies are already scrambling to cut exposure to the region, fearing their industry will be spotlighted next.</td>

      <td>A lot of savers shift gears after leaving work. Here’s what to consider before making that move.</td>
      <td>Target-date funds are a staple of employer-sponsored retirement funds, due in part to their ease of use. The funds adjust allocations over decades, starting with big equity exposures, then glide gradually into more fixed income.<br />But some investors don’t stick with them, particularly after they retire. Thinking they can do a better job of managing their money than a target-date funds’ manager, some investors shift the money into individual retirement accounts where they invest in other types of funds.<br />Is that the right move? Here are six things to consider before quitting a target-date fund:<br />1.  Target-date funds are short on customization<br />While one of the marketing points of target-date funds is that the funds are supposedly designed for the expected retirement year, the actual target dates typically are five years apart. That means investors usually end up choosing a fund with the date closest to the year in which they plan to leave full-time work. But retirement dates can change. The dates chosen can be off by years—as can someone’s preferred risk level.</td>

      <td>LONDON—The death of Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth’s husband of more than 73 years, sharpens the spotlight on their eldest son Prince Charles, who is increasingly tasked with managing the House of Windsor’s complex private affairs as well as matters of state.<br />No person has waited so long to rule the British realm as Prince Charles. The 72-year-old, also known as the Prince of Wales, is the longest-ever serving heir to the British throne. And while both he and his father have played a supporting role to Queen Elizabeth for decades, they have taken differing approaches.<br />His father, the Duke of Edinburgh, was a straight-talking former naval officer who made a virtue of steadfastly deferring to his wife while helping steer family matters behind the scenes.<br />The prince has strained to conform to the royal convention of political neutrality, campaigning on issues around the environment, designing his own town and launching a brand of organic food. The prince’s vision for a more slimmed-down, low-cost monarchy is starting to take shape but he has struggled to corral the family amid a series of mishaps and scandals.<br />His efforts to reframe the role of the Prince of Wales as an agent for change has brought both praise and criticism. Opinion polls regularly show Prince Charles trails other members of the royal family in terms of popularity.</td>

      <td>Businesses and governments across the West are gearing up to counter China’s dominance in a key component of modern technology: the magnet.<br />But the dozens of companies jostling for government support will struggle to establish a supply chain to rival China’s rare-earth magnet industry, which has a decadeslong head start and steadfast state support, analysts and executives say.<br />Powerful magnets made of rare-earth minerals are essential components in electric-vehicle motors, wind turbines and other technology. China mines over 70% of the world’s rare earths and is responsible for 90% of the complex process of turning them into magnets, analysts say. That dominance gives Beijing sway over makers of various fast-growing technologies.<br />The U.S. government is investing tens of millions of dollars in efforts to mine and process rare earths. President Biden in February signed an executive order directing a review of supply chains for critical materials, including rare earths. His recent infrastructure plan also pledged investment in rare-earth separation projects. Officials in Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia are getting their checkbooks out too.<br />Yet Western companies are mostly years away from contributing to a stable supply of rare earths, or processing them into separate minerals and turning them into useful products like magnets, analysts say.</td>

It generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the company annually, the documents show. In its lawsuit, Texas alleges that the project gave Google, a unit of  Alphabet Inc.,  an unfair competitive advantage over rivals.<br />The documents filed this week were part of Google’s initial response to the Texas-led antitrust lawsuit, which was filed in December and accused the search giant of running a digital-ad monopoly that harmed both ad-industry competitors and publishers. This week’s filing, viewed by The Wall Street Journal, wasn’t properly redacted when uploaded to the court’s public docket. A federal judge let Google refile it under seal.<br />Some of the unredacted contents of the document were previously disclosed by MLex, an antitrust-focused news outlet.<br />The document sheds further light on the state’s case against Google, along with the search giant’s defense.</td>

There is no guarantee the company will ultimately be sold.

With risk tolerance rising broadly and private-equity investors sitting on mountains of unspent cash, the firms have been testing the waters lately on megabuyouts again, including at  Royal KPN  NV and  Toshiba Corp.</td>

A spokeswoman for SKI declined to comment.<br />The settlement comes just ahead of a Sunday deadline for the Biden administration to potentially veto the trade commission’s decision. President Biden has made electric vehicles and the batteries that power them a core component of his proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure program. As part of that plan, he has proposed investing $174 billion in spurring uptake of electric vehicles.<br />The fate of the Georgia factory has major implications for Ford and VW, which are counting on the new assembly complex to build batteries for electric models such as Ford’s F-150 pickup truck and VW’s ID.4 crossover.

      <td>HONG KONG—A year after Covid-19 swept through China, the virus is under control. Now authorities have to motivate a population that feels little urgency to get vaccinated by using a mix of social pressure, incentives, education and coercion.<br />While surveys show vaccine acceptance remains high, the motivation to go out and get inoculated is lagging in the world’s second-largest economy given low infection rates.<br />China’s public health officials say the aim is to get 40% of the population vaccinated by summer. With the country administering more than 4.5 million shots a day in the past week, 161 million had been given by the end of Friday, according to the National Health Commission. Oxford University data-tracking project Our World in Data said about 11% of China’s population had received at least one dose.<br />That is a long way from herd immunity—which would require about 80% coverage—and compares with about a third of the U.S., according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />Another challenge for China is the low efficacy rate of its vaccines currently in use. Preliminary data suggest that they range somewhere between 50% to 80%. To optimize the protection rate, China was looking into, for example, adjusting the dosage, adding an extra shot or changing the interval between injections, George Gao, director of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said Saturday.</td>

      <td>The death of Prince Philip, at the center of public life for 75 years, marks generational shift in the life of a nation</td>
      <td>For the people of Britain, which mythologizes its role in World War II, the death of Prince Philip on Friday marks more than the loss of a figure who has been at the center of British public life for three-quarters of a century.<br />It signifies the changing of the guard within the monarchy and the nation more broadly from the generation that lived through that conflict and whose life arc encompassed the U.K.’s imperial zenith as well as its loss of empire and a shrinking global role.<br />Queen Elizabeth, the prince’s wife, remains on the throne, approaching her 95th birthday and apparently in good health. But Philip’s death severs one prominent link with what many Britons see as a heroic past and has provided the monarchy and the country with a chance to reflect on the future.<br />Prince Charles, heir to the throne, is a different character from his direct and forceful father. He is taking over management of family affairs and, increasingly, moving into roles that have so far fallen to his mother. The country, just out of the European Union, is finding where it fits on the world stage.<br />In some ways, Prince Philip, who was 99 years old, was a vestige of an earlier era that predated World War II, one in which the royal families of Europe intermarried. Born a prince of Greece and Denmark, he was, like his wife, descended from Queen Victoria.</td>

      <td>With big changes coming to iPhones, small online merchants are bracing for lost sales. ‘Why is Apple now the decider?’</td>
      <td>If  Apple  is King Kong and  Facebook  is Godzilla, mom-and-pop online merchants are worried they’re the screaming, scattering citizens who are about to get stomped as these two giants battle it out.<br />What’s at issue is a seemingly small change to the iPhone and iPad operating system that upends the past decade of the online ad industry, by prompting users to choose whether or not they’d like to be tracked by the apps they use.<br />Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook says the iOS update, currently rolling out, is about respecting user privacy. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has accused Apple and Mr. Cook of a power grab, an attempt to take control of data that has long been widely available to advertisers and data brokers. Facebook launched an ad campaign insisting that those who will be most hurt by Apple’s changes are small and medium-size businesses, which represent the majority of the social network’s more than 10 million advertisers.<br />Anything Facebook says about the virtues of it having unfettered access to our data should be greeted with an appropriate level of skepticism. But, according to small-business owners who advertise heavily online, and the agencies that help them, Facebook is speaking truth about how Apple’s shift might disproportionately affect them. What’s more, the privacy-minded ad tools the iPhone maker is offering instead likely won’t provide the same clear view of target customers.<br />It’s possible that businesses will end up having fewer insights into their ad spending—and paying more for less-effective advertising. Whether this change is enough to harm a business depends on its size, maturity and what sort of goods it sells.</td>

      <td>All the outmoded things you should purge from your wardrobe—plus, some updated men’s and women’s spring styles to take their place</td>
      <td>LAST MONTH, I discovered I was unfashionably out of date. I was headed to a socially distanced lunch in New York when a glimpse at my reflection in a store window made me cringe: My leggings were paired with no-longer-trendy “ugly” sneakers. A puffer jacket, worn to stay cozy while dining in a curbside hut, planted me solidly in 2017, the year I bought the voluminous chubby at  H&M .<br />After a year when serious concerns took precedence, there’s no shame in being blissfully stuck in a bygone era. But as we emerge from our Zoom cocoons, the time is ripe for reassessing our fashion choices and stepping up our wardrobes for a post-pandemic era—within reason, of course. “Seven-inch stilettos don’t line up with what we’re going through right now,” said New York fashion-brand consultant Dani Stahl. And don’t let beautiful celebrities be your sole style guides—they can make almost anything look fabulous. “What looks dated on one person is supercool on another,” she said. “If [model] Bella Hadid puts on tight jeans, it’s current, but elsewhere can look off.” That means they’ll be “off” on me, I think, and many, many others.<br />What makes an outfit outdated? Recognizable fads—like message-print T-shirts or early aughts-era no-show socks—are outfit poison, and fallbacks like chinos and shapeless cardigans are cringeworthy relics. A garment’s cut, too, can read “outmoded.” “You don’t want to look like you’re in a jacket from 30 years ago, so updated fits come into play,” said Paul Stuart creative director Ralph Auriemma. He suggested tailored sportswear for a sleeker, modern fit.<br />As we plan our re-entry outfits, comfort remains a factor, said Tracy Margolies, Saks Fifth Avenue’s chief merchant, “but people want to be stylish.” That’s why stifling skinny jeans, for instance, bow to straight-leg options and roomy denim joggers. Below, 10 men’s and women’s styles that will subtly date you—and advice on how to bring your wardrobe back to life.<br />Why They’re Out: In my college years, I called dresses from the commercially quaint British brand Laura Ashley “Heidis,” named for the classic children’s book by Johanna Spyri about an orphan growing up in the Swiss Alps. Today’s frilly, floral dresses—described by many as “cottagecore”—nod to Laura Ashley’s 1980s Liberty-print frocks and conjure a campy frivolity at odds with our 2021 selves. “Cottagecore sounds like a house muumuu…it’s very dated,” said Ms. Stahl, the fashion-brand consultant.</td>

      <td>There’s a lot of confusing information out there. You have to know which resources are worth your time.</td>
      <td>My wife and I would like to move when we retire. For better or worse, there’s no shortage of articles and lists that identify the “best” destinations. Can you point us toward some resources or starting points that might be better than others?<br />You’re right: The amount of information about where to retire can be overwhelming—and puzzling. The “top” locales today are all but certain to be supplanted by new favorites tomorrow. (Few writers or editors are in the business of reprinting the same rankings year after year.) And while some lists are based on analyzing reams of data—affordability, climate, access to healthcare, crime rates, etc.—others are more concerned with “personality,” the feel and look of a town or city.<br />In short, clarity is hard to come by. As an expert on retirement hot spots once told us: “The more I delve into it, the more I realize how much guess, by-gosh suppositions, bias and plain bull goes into this business.”<br />What follows are books and online resources that we think are helpful:<br />“America’s 100 Best Places to Retire” (make sure you get the sixth edition) looks at a range of destinations, and groups some in categories such as best college towns, mountain towns, “undiscovered” towns and “main street” towns. The book, edited by Annette Fuller. is a spinoff from a publication that might ring a bell: “Where to Retire,” the leading magazine in this field. The pandemic, though, has forced “Where to Retire” to suspend operations.</td>

      <td>Big consumer brands like  Coca-Cola Co.  and  Delta Air Lines Inc.  for years have positioned themselves as forces for promoting what they see as social good—an approach they displayed last summer after the death of George Floyd.<br />Coca-Cola turned off its Times Square billboard for a day. Delta flew Mr. Floyd’s body to his family in Houston. The Atlanta-based companies were among the scores of big corporations around the country that pledged an array of money and initiatives toward racial justice amid the upheaval that Mr. Floyd’s death while in police custody unleashed.<br />Now, business leaders are facing new pressures from progressive activists to prove that those commitments were more than just talk. As activists press companies to condemn new voting legislation, CEOs are again finding themselves walking a difficult line on emotional, political issues, risking blowback from all sides.<br />CEOs “put themselves on this path” by engaging on social issues in response to their employees and partly as a form of marketing, says Harris Diamond, former chief executive of ad giant McCann Worldgroup. “Once you open up that door, you have to live by it.”<br />The recent contentious fight over a Republican-led voting law in Georgia has illustrated the challenges. Civil-rights activists pressured Delta and Coca-Cola to take public stands against the law, which the groups have called restrictive and racist. Some of the companies’ own employees echoed those concerns.</td>

A doula is a trained, nonclinical health professional who provides intellectual, physical and emotional support to mothers during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. Ms. Spencer underwent training and certification in 2019, and worked occasionally at the hospital last year.<br />Ms. Spencer says she first meets with people giving birth to discuss their needs. She teaches them about the labor process, breathing techniques and different positions, and about hydrotherapy and other options in assisting deliveries. “We are trying to create a calming environment to facilitate a positive and memorable birth experience,” she says. Then, once it is time, she is with the mother throughout labor.<br />Ms. Spencer was born near Boston Medical Center. “I grew up in that neighborhood, on welfare in the inner city. It’s important for me to be giving back to my community of origin,” she says. The hospital serves primarily low-income Black and Brown families, including some refugees and immigrants.</td>

My son and his wife turned down many more items than they accepted. Much of what I had hoped to “upsize” to them stayed in my basement and attic.<br />What wasn’t easy to predict, however, was how complicated this seemingly simple transaction could be. It involved multiple perspectives, across multiple generations. It showed how possessions, when held up to the light, often lose the very qualities that prompted us to set them aside. And, in my case, it offered a glimpse of a future that I’ve thought about—and looked forward to—for years.</td>

      <td>Amazon . com Inc. employees in Alabama who sided against unionization said they had broad concerns about job security and grew convinced that their pay and benefits might not markedly increase with the help of a union.<br />The resounding victory for Amazon, the nation’s second-largest private employer, came after it organized what proved to be a successful local campaign, highlighting the company’s strengths and questioning the union’s benefits. Nationally, Amazon grew vocal in pushing back against criticism about its workplace conditions, including when a top executive engaged in disputes with members of Congress on Twitter.<br />Analysts say the defeat of unionization will strengthen Amazon after what has already been a year of tremendous growth and success fueled by the pandemic. The tech giant’s revenue last year soared 38% to $386 billion, and its profit nearly doubled, as it added 500,000 people to its global workforce.<br />Some workers said Amazon helped steer their vote against unionization. Other employees said they didn’t need convincing by Amazon and were against unionizing from the start.<br />Amazon pointed to its minimum wage of $15 an hour, double the state’s minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, which is also the federal minimum. The company also highlighted its healthcare and retirement benefits.</td>

The bad news is that financial assets have never been so expensive at the start of a recovery.<br />Stock markets have shaken off concerns about rising bond yields and are setting new highs. As of Friday, the S&P 500 index is up 10% this year.<br />Analysts usually compare share prices to the earnings companies generate, which is what investors ultimately have a claim on. Nobel laureate Robert Shiller uses data stretching back as far as 1871 to calculate price/earnings ratios, averaging profits over a decade, adjusted for inflation, to correct for economic booms and busts—a metric known as the Shiller P/E, or cyclically adjusted P/E ratio (CAPE).<br />The S&P Composite 1500 is trading at a CAPE of 37. That is more than twice the historical average, though still less than the dot-com bubble peak of 44. It reached 33 before the 1929 crash.<br />The problem with an “everything rally” is that, yes, everything is now expensive. Among stocks, even many pandemic-stricken cyclical industries such as airlines aren’t cheap anymore. And with interest rates at record lows and economic growth accelerating, bonds are looking stretched too. Treasurys could offer some value, but 10-year yields are still under 1.7%. As for corporate bonds, the extra return they offer relative to government paper has fallen to near its recent historic low.</td>

      <td>Eric Haze, 60, an artist and graphic designer working in New York since the 1970s, on his 1962 Plymouth Savoy, as told to A.J. Baime.<br />Cars are like love. You do not get to choose when it is going to happen. The car finds you, wherever it is, in whatever condition it is in. My 1962 Savoy first popped up in an online ad in 2016. I was living in Brooklyn, and the car was being sold by a guy whose family owned the oldest auto parts dealership in Fresno, Calif. I knew what I was looking at from the photos.<br />For many reasons, it was a gem. It was completely original, rust-free, original paint and interior. The downside: It was in pieces. The fenders were off, the hood was off, the drivetrain wasn’t completed and the seats were out.<br />Now, to understand why this car was so appealing to me, let me take you back to my childhood in Manhattan. I have been a freak for anything on wheels in motion since I was a kid. My friends and I built and traded bicycles up until we were driving. I had my first car at 18—a Datsun 240Z, the poor man’s  Porsche  back then.<br />My friends and I developed a passion for Chrysler and Plymouth Super Stock cars, from 1962 to 1965. [Plymouth was a division of Chrysler, and Super Stock is a production car modified for performance, by the factory itself.] The year 1962 was a transitional year in which American car companies began engaging in a racetrack-driven competition for speed, design and sales. Chrysler and Plymouth cars were class leaders, and their heritage speaks for itself.</td>

      <td>Let’s take the lessons of the past year and apply them to the post-pandemic world</td>
      <td>When the full story of Covid-19 is written, it will likely emphasize the physiology of the disease. We will understand the scientific nature of the virus, its tenacious binding to the lung and brain, and the cascade of symptoms and immunologic reactions that determine its run through the body.<br />More subtle and complicated, however, has been its disproportionate psychological impact on the lives of aging individuals who avoided the disease itself by largely staying at home and isolating themselves. If we didn’t know it or believe it before the pandemic, the hard reality is now unavoidable: Social isolation cripples and it kills.<br />As a doctor I knew the science of social isolation before the pandemic. But the pandemic has opened our eyes to the tragic consequences of loneliness in a way that was impossible before. Now, as life slowly returns to normal, let’s not close our eyes to what we’ve learned. Let’s acknowledge that despite our best efforts and technology, there is a missing element to living life by text, phone and video chat that must be illuminated and studied. And let’s make sure to take the lessons of the past year and apply them to our post-pandemic world.<br />Consider one of my patients, who is a sad reminder of what I’ve seen both in my practice and in my community. From the very first waves of coronavirus that hit Miami Beach, she was fastidious about staying at home and dutifully avoiding all the previously enjoyable rhythms of life, including her beauty salon, weekly card game and favorite lunch spot. At age 90, she was among the most vulnerable of the population, and only after her second vaccine did she begin to tentatively venture out.<br />But she is not the same person I knew at the outset. She is more hesitant and skittish about leaving her home, more irritable at her adult children’s admonitions, and more depressed by the losses of friends and social opportunities.</td>

      <td>After failed campaign, West Virginia lawmaker learned how to build a coalition embracing labor, business and social conservatives</td>
      <td>Joe Manchin’s path to becoming the Democrats’ most confounding U.S. senator started with a rejection within his own party.<br />Mr. Manchin, then a state senator and small-business owner, was running for West Virginia governor in 1996, his first bid for statewide office. He had built a business-friendly, culturally conservative profile during 15 years in the legislature, supporting job-creation incentives for business and opposing abortion rights. Banking and insurance groups endorsed him, along with the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association.<br />But an important set of players—the state’s labor unions—viewed him as an enemy, in large part because he had voted to scale back injury awards in the workers’ compensation system. At union gatherings, coal miners wore T-shirts with Mr. Manchin’s name crossed out. Bumper stickers featuring a bloody hatchet reminded workers of his vote. “Don’t forget workers’ comp” was a union battle cry.<br />Mr. Manchin lost the Democratic primary to a union-backed candidate. But the defeat set off a course correction that helps to explain his political buoyancy today as the rare Democrat representing a solidly Republican state, as well as his insistence on bipartisan cooperation in the Senate, often to the frustration of his own party.<br />Once viewed by unions as hostile, Mr. Manchin, after 1996, found issues on which he could advocate for union interests and began a campaign to convince organized labor that he would adopt an inclusive governing style that would give it a seat at the table in policy debates.</td>

The bill is facing a tough battle in the evenly divided Senate in coming weeks, after the House version of the bill passed 220-210 with no Republican support.<br />Proponents say the bill is necessary to protect access to the polls, especially for minority voters. They also argue that it is crucial now because many GOP-controlled state legislatures are considering their own laws to tighten voting rules, saying they would improve election security. (You can see a guide to Georgia’s new rules here.) Republicans argue that the bill amounts to a partisan, federal takeover of elections that would make voting less secure.<br />Here is a look at what is in the roughly 800-page bill, known as the For the People Act.<br />Big chunks of the For the People Act lay out rules regarding voting. Bill authors say new national minimum standards are needed to ensure access to the polls, while Republicans argue that states should retain flexibility on how they run elections and that the proposal would represent a federal takeover of voting rules.<br />States currently have wide latitude on questions such as early voting and vote-by-mail options. Some federal restrictions on changes to election practices in Southern states, which had been a core provision of the Voting Rights Act, were nullified by the Supreme Court in 2013.</td>

      <td>Retails analysts are predicting a rise in post-pandemic retail therapy, focused on dresses, heels, and other going-out looks. For inspiration, look no further than the icons of revenge style: Tina Turner and Princess Diana, both in the zeitgeist again.</td>
      <td>Off Brand is a column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />FOR A 1984 appearance on Late Night with David Letterman, Tina Turner, then 44, emerged in a microscopic black leather miniskirt, black top, fishnets and serious high heels. There to promote her first big solo record, “Private Dancer,” with its hit “What’s Love Got to Do With It,” she was in the midst of a Lazarus-like resurrection after leaving the abusive Ike Turner in 1976. As chronicled in the new HBO documentary about Ms. Turner’s life, “Tina,” the singer’s comeback was accessorized by body-conscious looks by Bob Mackie and Azzedine Alaïa and a punky bleached mullet. Her “revenge look,” as it’s come to be known in the zeitgeist, was one for the ages.<br />Along with other icons like Princess Diana—whose assertive post-Charles style is well chronicled—Ms. Turner’s late-in-life makeover is providing new inspiration to those eager to leave the pandemic behind. As the prospect of a vaccine-fueled social renaissance emerges, people are shopping again. Anecdotally, many of these purchases appear to be the kind of daring “going-out” fashions that are also associated with breakups and other big life changes. In fact, there’s a term for this exuberant post-slump spending: “revenge shopping.”<br />A 1980s photograph of Tina Turner in a cutaway leather Alaïa minidress is one of the images on the Instagram account @revengelooks, which also includes spicy styles from Nicole Kidman, Naomi Campbell, Brad Pitt, and other stars in their single heydays. The handle is run by Eloise Moran, a Los Angeles-based British writer who also posts to @ladydirevengelooks and is writing a book about Princess Diana’s style. She said that the ur-example of revenge style is the little black dress by Greek designer Christina Stambolian that the princess wore to a 1994 Serpentine Gallery event just after Prince Charles admitted on television that he had cheated on her.<br />Ms. Moran sees a clear parallel between this kind of splashy, public revenge look and the current post-pandemic urge to dress up. She explained that while “the idea of revenge dressing before may have been linked to getting out of a bad breakup or even losing a job and wanting to show that you’re doing okay,” what’s happening post-pandemic is “a different type of revenge because it’s this collective feeling that people just want to reject the entrapment of the past year. I think ultimately it’s about freedom.” This might mean buying a piece that’s a bit more revealing than you’d normally buy, after a year covered up at home. Or a pricey designer item, to compensate for that vacation you didn’t take.</td>

If you have it, call your provider and ask what types of cancellations and postponements your policy covers.<br />Then look over your individual vendor contracts to see what photographers, caterers and florists have to say when it comes to rescheduling.<br />“When vendors receive requests to reschedule, they have missed out on money for a specific day and may request the initial contract to be paid in full,” said Marsha Barnes, founder of The Finance Bar, a service that promotes financial wellness for women and couples.<br />Additionally, some vendors have increased their pricing as a result of safety measures that weren’t in place pre-pandemic, Ms. Barnes said.</td>

      <td><br />Salem, Mass.<br />At the center of the Peabody Essex Museum’s recently expanded South Asian Art galleries are five large paintings from M.F. Husain’s 1971 series on the Mahabharata epic about a family divided by war. In one painting, a yellow line slices the composition, bisecting a female nude. In another, two silhouettes mirror each other’s gestures, but one is black, the other fuchsia, and arrows beneath them point in different directions.<br />They are a powerful metaphor for the 1947 Partition that split the subcontinent into Pakistan and India and, here, Husain’s paintings underscore the break between the two sections of this inaugural installation. The first consists of 19th-century works that merchants, officers and sailors—members of the East India Marine Society of Salem—brought back as souvenirs; the second presents a lively and varied selection of mid- and late-20th-century works that Chester and Davida Herwitz collected from the 1970s through the 1990s.<br />The aim is not to chronicle a history of South Asian art—there is no chronological order or mention of, say, the Company School or the Progressive Artists Group. Instead, Siddhartha V. Shah, the museum’s curator of South Asian art and director of education and civic engagement, wants us to experience the works from many perspectives and doesn’t hesitate to reach out and occasionally give us a little shake.</td>

Royal Navy ships at sea will also participate to acknowledge the prince’s role as an officer during World War II.<br />Similar gun salutes were held in 1901 and in 1965 for the deaths of Queen Victoria and Winston Churchill, and are a tradition dating back to the 18th century. The custom is to fire 21 rounds, with an additional 20 rounds added when fired from a royal park.<br />The funeral for Prince Philip, who died Friday aged 99, will be a more restrained affair partly because of Covid-19 restrictions and also because he preferred a low-key ceremony. There will be no lying in state and no state funeral, the last of which was for Churchill. Buckingham Palace has already advised members of the public to stay away from royal residences and refrain from laying flowers. A traditional sign announcing the death of the prince and placed on the gates of Buckingham Palace was later removed to avoid attracting onlookers.<br />Royal funerals are typically much grander affairs, and the way Prince Philip’s death is marked will likely have little bearing on preparations for the eventual passing of Queen Elizabeth, the 94-year-old head of state.</td>

      <td>Cryptocurrency giant, which runs largest U.S. bitcoin exchange, plans to go public Wednesday</td>
      <td><br />Cryptocurrency giant Coinbase Global Inc. is gearing up for what investors expect to be a blockbuster stock-market debut, though doubts persist about its lofty valuation.<br />Coinbase plans to go public Wednesday through a direct listing on the  Nasdaq Stock Market .  The company, which runs the largest U.S. exchange for bitcoin and other digital currencies, could achieve a bigger market capitalization than any of the world’s traditional exchange operators. But it faces a number of threats, including competition in the fast-evolving cryptocurrency industry, that could undermine its stock price in the long run.<br />Based on the price of Coinbase shares in private-market trading earlier this year, the company is worth $91.5 billion on a fully diluted basis, securities filings show. And Coinbase reached that valuation even before releasing blowout results for the first quarter, when it benefited from a huge rally in the price of bitcoin.<br />During the first three months of 2021, Coinbase attracted 13 million new users and estimated it generated earnings of $730 million to $800 million on revenue of $1.8 billion. Even at the lower end of that earnings range, that’s more than twice its profit for all of last year.</td>

      <td>Masks, long waits and higher prices are now part of dining out as more restaurants reopen amid the pandemic</td>
      <td>After a year of start-stop openings, seating restrictions and delivery experiments, your favorite eatery is likely seating diners again. More U.S. restaurants reopened in February than in any month since last spring, when some cities first started loosening restrictions, according to  Yelp Inc.  Reopenings remained elevated last month, the Yelp data shows. While restaurants are trying to resume normal service, some pandemic practices will remain. Here’s what you need to know:<br />They are getting closer. Seventy-five percent of U.S. restaurants are now open for business and the number of people eating out is nearing pre-pandemic levels, according to reservation booking site OpenTable. It’s best to call ahead, though. About 10% of the 778,807 restaurants that existed prior to the pandemic have closed for good, market-research firm Datassential said last week.<br />Every state now allows limited on-site dining, though local officials say occupancy limits could tighten again if coronavirus cases keep rising. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday urged people to avoid indoor dining for two weeks given the rise in cases there. Some counties in California, for example, continue to prohibit indoor seating, though the state expects to lift restrictions by June if case numbers fall.<br />Warming weather gives restaurateurs and diners more options. “I’m building huge patios,” said Jim Armstrong, a Denver tavern owner who expects to seat at least 40 people outside his pubs when possible.<br />Most states still require diners to wear masks when not seated at their table. More than a dozen states, including Texas, Florida and Georgia, have scrapped public mask mandates, though some cities continue to enforce them and many individual businesses ask customers to keep wearing facial coverings.</td>

For unions, the time appeared ripe to organize workers in an expanding sector and an environment where labor unions traditionally have operated: a large blue-collar site where many employees do similar jobs.<br />The effort failed despite President Biden’s endorsement, his stated goal of creating more union jobs and a renewed embrace of labor by many congressional Democrats.<br />Last year, more union members worked for the government than for private-sector employers, according to the Labor Department, showing the public sector is now the stronghold of organized labor. Teacher strikes and protests in 2018 and 2019 won pay increases and other concessions in Arizona, West Virginia, Los Angeles and other states and cities, and more recently, educator unions influenced plans to reopen schools during the pandemic in Chicago and elsewhere.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A divided Supreme Court ordered California to permit in-home prayer meetings even while similar secular gatherings remain restricted by Covid-19 regulations, the latest in a string of high court orders directing officials to subordinate public-health measures to religious exercise.<br />The court’s 5-4 unsigned order, issued shortly before midnight Friday, provided the clearest direction yet to lower courts that are hearing religious challenges to public-health measures.<br />The decision comes after a pastor in Santa Clara County challenged coronavirus-related restrictions against in-home gatherings, which prevented him from bringing congregants to his residence for prayer meetings and bible study.<br />Public-health regulations are suspect “whenever they treat any comparable secular activity more favorably than religious exercise,” the court said. “It is no answer that a state treats some comparable secular businesses or other activities as poorly as or even less favorably than the religious exercise at issue.” Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and the three appointees of former President Donald Trump, Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, formed the majority.<br />“California treats some comparable secular activities more favorably than at-home religious exercise, permitting hair salons, retail stores, personal care services, movie theaters, private suites at sporting events and concerts, and indoor restaurants to bring together more than three households at a time,” the court said, and therefore the regulation of at-home religious gatherings violates the First Amendment’s protection for religious exercise.</td>

The 18.2 billion yuan fine is equivalent to 4% of the company’s domestic annual sales, the regulator added. Under Chinese rules, antitrust fines are capped at 10% of a company’s annual sales.<br />Alibaba’s business practices limited competition, affected innovation, infringed on the rights of merchants and harmed the interests of consumers, the regulator said.<br />”Alibaba accepts the penalty with sincerity and will ensure its compliance with determination,” the company said. “To serve its responsibility to society, Alibaba will operate in accordance with the law with utmost diligence, continue to strengthen its compliance systems and build on growth through innovation.”</td>

The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the IPO filing could come as soon as this week. The U.K.-based company plans to list on New York’s Nasdaq with the ticker symbol VACC.<br />The company was started by two Oxford scientists who helped lead the Covid-19 vaccine development  and who spun Vaccitech out of the university in 2016, with the goal of turning laboratory discoveries into commercial products. A key part of the vaccine technology uses an altered form of chimpanzee cold virus to ferry genetic material into humans to boost the immune system and fight infection.<br />Vaccitech has been aiming for a listed valuation of around $700 million, with backers estimating it could be a $1 billion company by year-end, The Journal reported last month.  The company recently raised $168 million in new funding as a step toward a share offering.<br />It had $4.8 million in revenue last year and a loss of about $17.7 million and hasn’t generated any revenue from product sales, according to Friday’s filing. It said Vaccitech aims to raise $100 million—a figure generally put in debut IPO filings as a placeholder to be adjusted during marketing of the company.</td>

      <td>His panel on court-packing tilts sharply to the legal and political left.</td>
      <td>President Biden on Friday announced his Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court, which is better understood as the commission on packing the Supreme Court. The White House is trying to make this seem like routine political business, but don’t be fooled.<br />Packing the Court hasn’t been actively debated since FDR’s attempt flopped in the 1930s. Then again, many things Democrats are doing these days haven’t been tried since the 1930s. Democrats had a meltdown over Donald Trump’s three High Court appointees, and Mr. Biden’s commission idea was a way to appease progressives and avoid taking a firm position during the 2020 campaign.<br />“The Commission’s purpose is to provide an analysis of the principal arguments in the contemporary public debate for and against Supreme Court reform, including an appraisal of the merits and legality of particular reform proposals,” says a White House press release. “The topics it will examine include the genesis of the reform debate; the Court’s role in the Constitutional system; the length of service and turnover of justices on the Court; the membership and size of the Court; and the Court’s case selection, rules, and practices.”<br />The commission will have an unwieldy 36 members, who tilt markedly to the political left. The co-chairs are Bob Bauer, Barack Obama’s former White House counsel, and Cristina Rodriguez, a former official in the Obama Justice Department. Mr. Bauer has argued publicly against court-packing, but he’ll have his hands full with the commission.<br />The White House release says Duke law professor Guy-Uriel Charles “writes about the relationship between law and political power and law’s role in addressing racial subordination.” Caroline Fredrickson is a former president of the American Constitution Society, the left-wing legal lobby. Michael Waldman runs the Brennan Center for Justice, the highly partisan legal shop at NYU that wants to restrict political speech.

      <td>Big Labor pulled out all the stops to organize an Alabama warehouse.</td>
      <td>For five months the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union pitched itself as a savior to employees at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama, but the workers have now said no thanks. By a preliminary vote of 71% to 29% tallied Thursday and Friday, the employees turned down the chance to unionize and declined to join the left’s aggressive campaign against employers.<br />In the vote overseen by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) at Amazon’s warehouse in Bessemer, 55% of the 5,876 eligible employees cast votes, a larger turnout than the union predicted. Voting ran for nearly two months until March 29, giving workers ample time to consider their choice.<br />The outcome is an embarrassing blow to Big Labor and its allies, who saw the effort as the start of a wave of organizing at Amazon and other large employers. Union president Stuart Appelbaum told the press during the vote that the retail giant “does not respect the health and safety of its employees, not even their human dignity.” He added that “Amazon has 800 warehouses in the United States, so the fight is just beginning.”<br />Politicians threw their weight into the fight and made it almost a national cause. President Biden told workers “your health, your safety, higher wages” were on the line in a video, a rare intervention in a union vote by a sitting President. Sen. Bernie Sanders addressed employees at the warehouse, urging them to “take on the wealthiest guy in the world,” a reference to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.<br />Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio also endorsed the union drive at Bessemer as a response to Amazon’s censorship of conservative books and other sins. But he might pay more attention to workers if he wants the GOP to be the working-class party.</td>

      <td>The latest migrant numbers show much more than a seasonal increase.</td>
      <td>The White House has tried to pass off the migrant surge at the U.S.-Mexico border as nothing more than a routine seasonal sojourn. “It happens every year,” President Biden said in a news conference last month. New York Rep. Ritchie Torres called the crisis “more of a cyclical occurrence than a unique consequence of the Biden Administration policy.”<br />Bad timing, as the latest data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows. CBP said this week that there were more than 172,300 encounters with migrants on the Southwest border in March, a 71% increase over February. That’s up from 103,731 in March 2019 and 50,347 in March 2018.<br />That includes a record 18,890 unaccompanied children, compared to 9,380 in March 2019 and 5,244 in March 2018. CBP also reported 53,623 encounters with family units last month, a 173% increase over February and the most since the peak of the 2019 border crisis. In 2020 the pandemic kept numbers low.<br />There is a seasonal element to this, but the current surge is a much more serious spike related to the incentives provided by Biden Administration rhetoric and policy. The U.S. now expels single adults under a pandemic emergency measure known as Title 42, but it allows children who cross the border illegally alone to stay. The Biden Administration has also released into the U.S. large numbers of families who crossed the border illegally with young children. Migrant parents recognize this as a chance to gain entry.<br />U.S. facilities for housing migrants are overcrowded and the border patrol is overwhelmed. The humanitarian crisis will continue to worsen unless the policy incentives change.</td>

As the U.S. economy reopens more fully, comparative data is emerging about the 50 states that illuminate how much of the economic harm was self-inflicted.<br />The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) recently published state personal income and GDP data for the fourth quarter and 2020 calendar year. Most states suffered a massive decline in GDP in 2020’s second quarter as governors followed the advice of public-health officials to shut down businesses to “flatten the curve.”<br />But the new data show that states that allowed businesses to reopen sooner, and maintained fewer restrictions for the rest of the year, recovered by year-end. Real GDP for private industries fell 1.3% nationally at an annual compounded rate between the first and fourth quarters, according to BEA.<br />Yet there was large variation among the states. Hawaii’s economy declined the most (-9.9%)—no surprise given its dependence on tourism. Wyoming (-6.6%) and other energy-producing states were also slow to bounce back. New York’s (-5%) recovery was third worst, and even New Jersey (-2.3%) and Connecticut (-0.3%) fared better. Utah performed the best, growing 4.3%. It also has the sixth lowest per capita Covid death rate.<br />Northeast states were slammed hardest in the spring, so governors in the region were understandably more cautious about easing business restrictions. Yet New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo kept many businesses shut all summer despite ample hospital capacity and fewer Covid cases. He let retail and restaurants in New York City partially reopen in the fall, but then reimposed a near-total lockdown in December. New York’s economy never awoke from its spring coma.</td>

The district was a hot spot of abolitionism and the fledgling women-rights movement.<br />Rochester, on the region’s western edge, was home to Frederick Douglass, ex-slave and celebrated orator, who published his abolitionist newspaper, the North Star, in a church basement. The village of Seneca Falls, on Cayuga Lake, was the site of the first women’s rights convention, in 1848, with its seminal Declaration of Rights and Sentiments. A medical school on Seneca Lake was the first to award a degree to a woman, Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell.<br />Then there is Auburn, which sits at the northern tip of Owasco Lake. The town is at the heart of Dorothy Wickenden’s “The Agitators,” an absorbing and richly rewarding chronicle of three principled women who fought on behalf of abolitionism and women’s rights. The title comes from Lucretia Mott, a prominent feminist, abolitionist and Quaker who proudly modeled herself on the early Friends—social activists whom she once described as “agitators, disturbers of the peace.” Ms. Wickenden, executive editor of the New Yorker, traces the Auburn women’s lives with intelligence, compassion and verve. In an earlier book, “Nothing Daunted,” she told the story of two Auburn girls who left home to become teachers in the wilds of Colorado in 1916.<br />The most famous member of the Auburn trio is Harriet Tubman, whose life story is well-known. Born into slavery in Maryland, she escaped to Philadelphia in 1849, when she was in her 20s, only to return to her home state as a conductor on the Underground Railroad that carried escaped slaves to freedom. During the Civil War, she worked as a scout, spy and nurse for the Union Army.<br />Auburn was one of Tubman’s stops on the Underground Railroad. Close to Lake Ontario, it was a jumping-off point for Canada, where fugitive slaves could be assured of safety. In Auburn, Tubman was introduced to Martha Coffin Wright and Frances Miller Seward, who opened their homes to the freedom seekers she sent their way. Giving a meal and a bed to a runaway slave was an act of courage in an era when the Fugitive Slave Acts of 1793 and 1850 imposed harsh penalties on those who helped escapees. On the night that the first fugitive arrived in the Wrights’ kitchen, Martha felt “a sense of satisfaction unlike any she’d ever experienced,” Ms. Wickenden writes. “She was violating a law she could not tolerate, transforming her kitchen—the symbolic heart of woman’s sphere . . . —into a place of political asylum.”</td>

      <td>A Brexit dispute threatens to upend the Good Friday Agreement I worked hard to finish 23 years ago.</td>
      <td>The nationalist Catholic politician John Hume and I completed what became known as the Good Friday Agreement 23 years ago Saturday. It was designed to end the 35 years of violence that had cost thousands of lives in Northern Ireland and beyond, and to deal with the sectarian divisions that had allowed terrorism to fester. Today tensions are returning, as the agreement is in danger from a dispute over Brexit.<br />At the time, the Ulster Unionists, the party I led, had to swallow many unpalatable compromises. Terrorists were released from prison. Those who had taken part in terrorist activities were encouraged to participate in democracy; some leaders of terrorist groups became members of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Fundamental changes were made to the police, which had borne the brunt of the terrorist campaign.<br />Political structures were set up for cooperation between the North and South—a development that many unionists viewed with suspicion, believing that the point was to draw Northern Ireland away from the U.K. Similar structures had led to the collapse of the 1973 Sunningdale Agreement between the British and Irish governments. But we managed to find a solution.<br />Despite these compromises, the majority of people in Northern Ireland endorsed the Good Friday Agreement. They did so on the belief that Northern Ireland’s constitutional position within the U.K. couldn’t be changed without their consent. At great political and personal cost I secured that commitment from the governments in London and Dublin, Mr. Hume’s Social Democratic and Labour Party, and the leadership of Sinn Féin, an organization that, then as now, desired to see Northern Ireland incorporated into the Republic of Ireland to the south. All parties agreed that any constitutional change to the province’s status would require the assent of the people of Northern Ireland in a referendum. This commitment is stated clearly in the first declaration of the agreement.<br />Despite strong opposition from members of my own community, who resented the concessions to those engaged in republican violence, I campaigned for a “yes” vote in the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement, arguing that it protected the union and put the future of Northern Ireland in the hands of its people. Voters put their trust in my assurances and supported the agreement.</td>

      <td>The Biden administration is favoring Singapore and Vietnam over Thailand, a treaty partner since 1833.</td>
      <td>President Biden has promised to work closely with allies and partners around the world. But he seems to be overlooking Asia’s U.S. ally of longest standing, Thailand. Mr. Biden’s Interim National Security Strategic Guidance omitted Thailand from its list of friends and allies in the Indo-Pacific.<br />The guidance commits the U.S. to “deepen our partnership with India and work alongside New Zealand, as well as Singapore, Vietnam, and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states.” Of the four countries mentioned, only New Zealand shares Thailand’s designation as a major non-NATO ally. Thailand, which ranks among the world’s top 25 countries by gross domestic product, was similarly left off the 40-country invitation list for Mr. Biden’s April 22 Global Climate Summit.<br />In 1833 the U.S. and Thailand signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, America’s first treaty with any country in Asia. The two countries have been strategic allies since the signing of the Manila Pact in 1954. The importance of the U.S.-Thai strategic relationship was renewed in the 2012 and 2020 Joint Vision Statements for the Thai-U.S. Defense Alliance. The U.S. typically engages in more than 400 military exercises and other interactions a year with Thai counterparts.<br />Thailand and the U.S. also have a long and deep history of cooperation in law enforcement. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has been working closely with the Royal Thai Police since 1963 against narcotics trafficking. Thailand is also one of only five countries in the world to host an International Law Enforcement Academy run with the U.S. Since its founding in 1998, ILEA Bangkok has trained more than 22,000 law enforcement professionals from around Asia.<br />Thailand is strategically positioned in the middle of Asean, and Asean is at the heart of U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy. As the Biden administration develops its foreign policy and national-security strategy, it should leave no doubt of its commitment to the country’s oldest ally in Asia.</td>

      <td>In post-Katrina New Orleans, Louisiana built a system that serves the needs of students, not adults.</td>
      <td>The Covid-19 pandemic has brought into focus a stark choice: Will we respond to the enormous disruption of schools by rethinking education, or will we double down on an outdated industrial-age system created to prepare kids for the last century?<br />New Orleans faced a similar dilemma after Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005. Louisiana’s Legislature had in 2003 created a Recovery School District to turn around failing schools, but the storm’s devastation accelerated the process. The RSD was responsible for dozens of schools, which became charter schools. Students were freed from traditional attendance zones and allowed to pick their schools. Thousands of teachers were asked to reapply for their positions.<br />Louisiana in subsequent years allowed funding to follow the student, but the most effective way to improve student performance, which correlates with higher lifetime earnings and better socioeconomic outcomes, is great teaching. Louisiana reformed its teacher compensation and tenure laws, tying them to student outcomes as part of an effort to reward great teachers.<br />New Orleans recently became the first major city where all public-school students attend charter schools. Graduation and retention rates and student test scores increased; 62% of students attended the state’s lowest-performing schools (F-grade) in 2004-05, but that share fell to 8% by 2018. To help disadvantaged students narrow the achievement gap, some New Orleans schools adopted a competency-based approach to learning as opposed to one based on seat time. Others formed partnerships with Teach for America and hired teachers with nontraditional backgrounds. Some schools offered specialized curricula focusing on math and science.<br />When it comes to reforming the nation’s schools, the hardest challenge will be convincing teachers unions of the need to make big changes. Once they concede the status quo is untenable, building consensus on the necessary changes is much more likely.</td>

      <td>The smallest avians have always captured imaginations—sometimes to their own detriment.</td>
      <td>I can’t recall when I saw my first hummingbird, but I clearly remember my son’s first sighting. He was 6, on the porch swing of his great-grandmother’s lakeside cottage in the Adirondacks. “Wow,” he said. “That’s an awfully big fly.”<br />The iridescent little buzzer was hovering above us for quick nips of sugar water from a hummingbird feeder suspended from the porch rafters. After reading “The Glitter in the Green,” Jon Dunn’s fantastically informative book about hummingbirds, I now know with certainty that it was a Ruby-throated Hummingbird. Why? Because that is the only species of Trochilidae that breeds in the northeastern United States.<br />Mr. Dunn, a natural-history writer and photographer, lives in Scotland’s Shetland Islands, which are devoid of hummingbirds, since they are found exclusively in the Americas. He became fascinated with the cabinet of hummingbirds he saw as a boy in London’s Museum of Natural History; unlike the blue tits and goldfinches he knew from his home in England’s Somerset countryside, these tiny, jewel-like birds looked as if they were “dipped in rainbows.”<br />In his pursuit of what he calls “the glitter in the green,” Mr. Dunn cooked up a plan to see as many of the more than 300 species of hummingbirds as he could—particularly rare or threatened varieties which turn up in terrains at “the very limits of what [is] possible for [their] kind.” His quest takes him the full length of hummingbirds’ 9,000-mile range in the Americas, from a few hundred miles south of the Arctic Circle in Alaska, where he seeks the migrating Rufous Hummingbird, to a few hundred miles north of the Antarctic Circle in Tierra del Fuego, in search of the Green-backed Firecrown.<br />Along the way, Mr. Dunn spots dozens and dozens of spectacular varieties, whose descriptive names often reference gemstones, flowers and classical myths. In Costa Rica alone, his many finds include Crowned Woodnymphs, Blue-throated Goldentails, Band-tailed Barbthroats, Canivet’s Emeralds, Lesser Violetears, Magenta-throated Woodstars and Black-crested Coquettes. (Many are pictured in this book, but you can see more in the  documentary narrated by David Attenborough, “Jewelled Messengers,” which includes an extraordinary mating dance by a male Wire-crested Thorntail, set to a pulsing tango.)</td>

      <td>At its height, the empire of Chinggis Khan drew strength from flexibility.</td>
      <td>The Mongols have been ill-served by history, the victims of an unfortunate mixture of prejudice and perplexity. In popular memory Chinggis Khan exists chiefly in relation to the European and Chinese civilizations he threatened, and the rhythms and contours of steppe life are incomprehensible. Reflecting on “The Historian’s Craft” (1949), Marc Bloch decried his peers’ tendency “to assign an arbitrarily chosen and strictly pendulum-like rhythm to realities to which such regularity is entirely alien. It is an impossible task. Naturally, we do very badly at it. We must look for something better.”<br />Marie Favereau’s “The Horde: How the Mongols Changed the World” is something better. The author, an associate professor of history at Paris Nanterre University, negotiates her subject’s pressing challenges, namely: to explain an equestrian regime to what is, in early 2021, the most sedentary readership imaginable; to demonstrate that Mongol primacy and relevance did not end with Chinggis Khan; and, at last, to cast aside the “enduring stereotype of parasitical nomads.”<br />The Mongols of repute date to the 13th century, when they emerged as the dominant clan among an overlapping network of pastoral nomads and blood feuds around the Orkhon Valley. Chinggis Khan—born Temüjin, named for an enemy Tatar captured on the day of his birth ca. 1160—avenged his father and the politically motivated kidnapping of his wife, Börte, by defeating and subsuming his rivals, the Merkit, Tatars, Naiman and Kereit. In 1206, Temüjin restyled himself Chinggis (“mighty” or “universal”) Khan. A “golden lineage” was established—his descendants, Ms. Favereau notes, “did not all rule, but only they had the opportunity to serve as sovereign”—and refractory neighbors were integrated by the sword. Violent proclamations were faultlessly thorough: “We shall measure the Tatars against the linchpin of a cart, and kill them to the last one”; Merkit prisoners were to be enslaved and dispersed “here and there down to the last one.”<br />Chinggis’s true aim, however, was not annihilation so much as absorption, which conferred legitimacy and compounded economic and military power. The vanquished were separated and distributed among families and the army. “The similarity of nomads’ lifestyles” and the prospect of social advancement smoothed the process of assimilation, as did the starkness of the choice presented to former adversaries: “rejecting Mongol control was perilous, joining the society and furthering its expansion was profitable.” As Ms. Favereau writes, “the regime created a social and political order that was simultaneously novel and traditional, flexible enough to provide opportunities to the non-ruling class and rigid enough to centralize power.”<br />To the west, in the lower Volga region between Moscow and the Caspian Sea, lay the Qipchaqs, who had wandered from northern China centuries before and now provoked Mongol ire by giving refuge to Merkit rebels. Chinggis dispatched his eldest son and heir apparent, Jochi, to set an example. In 1217-18, the Merkit remnants were crushed. Some 20 years later, so, too, were their Qipchaq protectors. Jochi’s death, in 1227, preceded Chinggis’s by six months. His versatile community of followers in the western steppe, who in the coming centuries, Ms. Favereau contends, “took a foremost role in the future of its Russian, European, and Mediterranean neighbors,” would be known as the Horde.</td>

      <td>What is the universe made of? Physicists have answers but no unified theory explaining everything.</td>
      <td>What’s God got to do with it? Given that the majority of physicists are agnostics at best, I have always found it puzzling that my community is so obsessed with God’s mind, whether or not God plays dice, the God particle and seeing God—and now with Michio Kaku’s  “The God Equation.” Title notwithstanding, this is an excellent book written by a masterful science communicator elaborating on a subject that is his research home turf—superstring theory. The prolific author of multiple popular science books, Mr. Kaku is a futurist, broadcaster and professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York. He is also the host of the wildly successful and popular weekly radio program Science Fantastic. If there is anyone who can demystify the esoteric mathematics and physics of string theory, it is he. And in this wonderful little book, that is precisely what he does—explain in clear and simple terms the conceptual breakthroughs, the blind alleys and the unanswered questions—in the search for a grand unified theory of everything. Most of all, what I like best is that he remains open to the possibility that there may ultimately not be a single unifying theory after all, encoded into a single tidy equation.<br />The dream to synthesize all known physical forces has been a longstanding challenge; many physicists, including Einstein, have embarked on the pursuit and failed. The four fundamental forces of nature are gravity, electromagnetism, the “weak force” responsible for radioactive decay of some nuclei, and the “strong force” binding the atomic nucleus together.<br />When Newton discovered the laws of gravity, he accomplished the phenomenal task of connecting the celestial and terrestrial with a universal theory of gravitation that accounted both for a falling apple and the orbit of the Earth around the sun. Subsequently, as physicists uncovered additional fundamental forces in nature—electromagnetism, the weak force and the strong force—they set about combining all of them into ever-grander theories. Mr. Kaku traces each of these pivotal moments of unification, describing the key insights that permitted those breakthroughs and bringing us to the precipice, where we currently stand, stymied. The ultimate challenge—to unify gravity and quantum mechanics—is yet to be accomplished. To highlight how momentous unification would be, Mr. Kaku ends the book with a quote from Stephen Hawking: “it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we would know the mind of God”—hence, I suppose, the God equation.<br />Mr. Kaku argues persuasively that every time physicists have decoded one of the four fundamental forces of the universe, it not only revealed the secrets of nature, but radically revolutionized society too. He connects Newton’s laws to the invention of the steam engine and the launch of the Industrial Revolution, while Michael Faraday’s later discovery of electric and magnetic fields powered the electrical age. Mr. Kaku offers a superb description of how electrical transmission works, connecting the dots from Faraday’s equations to Edison’s and Tesla’s experiments and then to our illuminated, “electrified” life today. Eventually we come to the revolution of quantum mechanics—the description of matter on the smallest scale—which shook the very core of physics. The subsequent applications that came out of the quantum revolution, the transistor and laser, ushered in a world dependent on electronics.<br />“The God Equation” dazzles in its account of the unfinished quest for a grand unified theory. As Mr. Kaku describes, controversies have dogged the unified theory project from the very start. Faraday was the first to propose a unification of gravity and electromagnetism. In 1832 he conducted a set of experiments from London’s Waterloo Bridge and dropped magnets, hoping to find some quantifiable effect of gravity. Alas, the experiment failed, though he remained convinced that the effect existed, perhaps at an undetectable level. In 1947, one of the founders of quantum mechanics, Erwin Schrödinger, famously held a press conference to announce victory—he claimed to have a unified field theory. He did not—embarrassingly, his version could not even explain the nature of electrons and the atom. The other illustrious co-founders of quantum mechanics, Werner Heisenberg and Wolfgang Pauli, followed suit and failed as well. The first real major step came with the discovery of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which provided a quantum theory of electrons and light. Then came the connection to the best current description of the strong nuclear force with the development of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The standard model of particle physics that consolidates the zoo of subatomic particles emerged from these developments, bringing us to a “theory of almost everything.” The quest to unify all four fundamental forces in the universe has unfortunately stalled here. I write this on the heels of an announcement by Fermi National  Laboratory of a potential discovery, a likely hint for the existence of a possible additional force of nature—which, if it stands up, reveals the existence of physics beyond the currently accepted standard model.</td>

      <td>Archaeogenetics has changed our picture of how ancient Homo sapiens spread—and who they met.</td>
      <td>In the mid-20th century, the discovery that the carbon-14 isotope decays at a fixed rate unleashed the “radiocarbon revolution”—by measuring how much the carbon in material had decayed, an estimate could be made as to its age. Organic matter was now datable, as long as it had been part of a living organism in the last 50,000 years or so, and the study of prehistory was changed forever. Radiocarbon dating remains a basic tool of archaeology, and we are now living through an even greater revolution, what the scientist Johannes Krause and journalist Thomas Trappe call, in their bracing summary of what we have learned so far, “archaeogenetics”—the study of ancient DNA.<br />Every cell in your body contains copies of your DNA, the unique set of instructions that ultimately make you you. Your DNA came from your parents, who in turn inherited their DNA from their parents, in a continuous line stretching back to the first humans and beyond. DNA is thus a kind of organic record of ancestry, and in the billions of nucleotide base-pairs that comprise your genome, there lies an encoded story of how you came to be.<br />Commercial ancestry companies have cashed in on our natural, if solipsistic, curiosity about these individual histories. In reality, these companies will sequence your personal genome, compare it to massive datasets using a proprietary algorithm, and sell you back—as Messrs. Krause and Trappe put it—“folklore.” Even so, as many customers can attest, direct-to-consumer genetic testing can be fun, surprising and unsettling, when cherished family myths are debunked or unexpected relatives appear in the family tree.<br />Something similar is happening to our collective human story, thanks to the archaeogenetics revolution. This revolution is built on two interrelated technical advances. The first is known as high-throughput sequencing, technology that has made it exponentially faster and cheaper to decipher genomes. While the Human Genome Project took 10 years, billions of dollars and a world-wide collaboration to first map a human genome, today a lab with a single sequencing machine can process 300 human genomes in one day.<br />The second breakthrough is the ability to recover and identify ancient DNA. If you want to have your personal genome sequenced, you will swab some saliva. The dead can’t do that. Worse, from the moment a person dies, their cells stop replicating, and the DNA inside starts falling apart. Although the idea of sequencing ancient DNA has been around for decades, confident recovery of ancient DNA remained elusive. The biggest problem was, and is, contamination: Stray bits of DNA are everywhere, especially in the soil.</td>

      <td>While crowned heads were losing their power in Europe, unrest elsewhere inaugurated monarchies.</td>
      <td>In late 1805, Napoleon Bonaparte scored his famous victory over the Austrian and Russian armies on the wintertime battlefield of Austerlitz. At almost the same time half a world away, courtiers in the Sri Lankan kingdom of Kandy were celebrating their recent triumph over Anglo-Indian forces with an epic poem, the “Ingrisi Hatana” (“English Battle”), set down on palm leaves.<br />Austerlitz has long been seen as a turning point in the age of revolutions, roughly 1770 to 1850, that ushered in the modern world. Napoleon’s victory dealt a body blow to a European old regime already tottering from the spread of republicanism and popular sovereignty. But historians have given far less attention to Britain’s nearly simultaneous defeat by Kandy. It hardly rates a mention in the many histories of the revolutionary era, which tend to focus on Europe and the Americas.<br />In “Waves Across the South: A New History of Revolution and Empire,” Sujit Sivasundaram turns this perspective on its head by looking at the age of revolutions from the Indian and Pacific Oceans. A professor of world history at the University of Cambridge who has written well-received scholarly books on colonial science and early British Sri Lanka, Mr. Sivasundaram guides the reader smoothly through the expanses of the oceanic south. His account, enriched by deep archival research and the use of visual and material evidence, has a human scale and texture sometimes lacking in similar global histories.<br />The book unfolds as an inward-spiraling tour of the region. It begins with chapters on the Pacific islands and southern Africa, at the two extremes of the southern ocean, continues north to the Persian Gulf, then rounds the curve to Australia. It comes to rest on the Indian subcontinent, the region’s strategic center that was also—and not coincidentally—the heartland of the 19th-century British empire.<br />The familiar ideas and figures of the Atlantic revolutionary era, from democracy to George Washington, are at best ghostly presences in this reoriented revolutionary history. Mr. Sivasundaram instead gives main billing to a “surge of indigenous politics” that tilted heavily toward monarchism.</td>

      <td>A ship raised from the depths helps tell the story of a pivotal naval battle in the War of Independence.</td>
      <td>Among the most striking exhibits at the National Museum of American History in Washington is the well-preserved Revolutionary War gunboat Philadelphia. In 1935, the sturdy vessel was raised from the depths of Lake Champlain, where she had lain undisturbed since being sunk by British gunfire on Oct. 11, 1776. Remarkably, one of the vessel’s three guns was still loaded, and the 24-pound iron cannon ball that sent her to the bottom remained lodged in her hull.<br />Technically classed as a “gondola,” but unlike any craft seen plying the canals of Venice, the Philadelphia is both the oldest surviving ship of the United States Navy and a remarkable relic of a year in which American independence hung in the balance.<br />The Philadelphia was lost when     a flotilla commanded by Benedict Arnold defied a far stronger British fleet in an encounter off Valcour Island, on Lake Champlain’s western shore. The fortunes of the rival forces, and the events that set them in motion, are explored in Jack Kelly’s vividly written “Valcour: The 1776 Campaign That Saved the Cause of Liberty.”<br />The confrontation followed a tense summer when the demoralized and smallpox-ravaged survivors of the disastrous American invasion of Canada regrouped around Fort Ticonderoga,   a famed but dilapidated stronghold at the southern end of Lake Champlain. There they anxiously awaited a British strike from the north.<br />Such retaliation demanded naval supremacy. With no freshwater fleet capable of facing the four vessels that the Americans had recently acquired, the British needed to assemble one  as quickly as possible. Because rapids on the Richelieu River blocked easy access from the St. Lawrence, they established a shipyard above them   at St. Johns, just across the Canadian border. Meanwhile, the patriots reinforced their own flotilla, constructing craft like the Philadelphia at Skenesborough (modern-day Whitehall, N.Y.).</td>

      <td>Some animals hardly deteriorate as they get older. New therapies could help humans to achieve the same healthy longevity.</td>
      <td>Every year that you’re alive, your risk of dying increases by 10%. This starts out innocuously enough: In your 30s, your odds of death in any given year are less than one in 1,000. But compounding 10% per annum starts to add up frighteningly quickly: By age 90, if you’re lucky enough to make it that far, your odds of not making your 91st birthday are roughly one in six.<br />We all know, of course, that we’re more likely to die as we get older and accept this as a fact of nature. Those of us who make it far enough expect to be confronted with frailty, disease and death caused by our bodies’ degeneration with time. If you cast the net a bit wider, however, this fact of nature appears less immutable. Some species of tortoises, for example, have a risk of death that doesn’t seem to change with age in adulthood. Though these wrinkly, lumbering beasts might not seem like ideal ambassadors for aging well, by the statistical definition of aging—how fast your risk of death increases with time—these tortoises hardly age at all.<br />This phenomenon is known as “negligible senescence.” Some kinds of salamanders and fish, tiny pond creatures called hydra, and burrow-dwelling rodents called naked mole-rats all have a risk of death unrelated to how long ago they were born. This often means that they live much longer than closely related species. Mice might live to 3 years old but naked mole-rats can survive into their 30s.<br />A secret of the tortoises’ longevity is that their cells can divide more than twice as many times as human cells before becoming aged or “senescent.” Naked mole-rats are more enigmatic, aging in similar ways to us at the microscopic level; other biological mechanisms appear to keep them healthy regardless. The crucial result is that these animals don’t just live a long time, but they do so in good health. You would be hard-pressed to tell which adult naked mole-rats are the oldies. They maintain everything from muscle mass to fertility until extreme old age, scurrying around fit and healthy and even reproducing.<br />So do we humans have to age the way we do? Rapid progress in the biology of aging is leading us to wonder whether humans could take our first tentative steps towards negligible senescence by treating the aging process itself. The aim of biogerontologists working in this fast-developing field is to maximize not lifespan but healthspan: the number of years we spend free from disease, disability and impairment. No one wants to live to 130 if it includes a 50-year stint in a nursing home at the end. Extended healthy life is less attention-getting than eternal life, but pursuing preventive treatments that target the underlying cause of most human suffering could lead there and to a profound revolution in medicine.</td>

      <td>Cable operator Charter Communications Inc. told consumers to say goodbye to competitor Windstream Holdings Inc. when it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019. That farewell message could be costly following a bankruptcy judge’s ruling Thursday.<br />Judge Robert Drain of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y., said that Charter, which operates under the Spectrum brand, must pay more than $19 million in damages for sending “literally false and intentionally misleading” mailers urging customers to switch telecom providers after Windstream filed for chapter 11.<br />The legal fight highlights the ways companies can try to capitalize when a competitor files for bankruptcy, and the perils that can invite. Mailers that Charter sent to Windstream customers in March 2019 said they should switch to Spectrum “to ensure you are not left without vital Internet and TV services” because of the bankruptcy and told consumers to say “Goodbye, Windstream. Hello, Spectrum.”<br />The ads were mailed in envelopes with a color strip mimicking the bright pink and purple color scheme Windstream had used in its own advertising, court papers said, a similarity that Windstream argued was meant to confuse its customers.<br />Jude Drain agreed, ruling that Charter, which could appeal, used misleading advertising to attract Windstream customers and therefore violated the automatic stay, a legal shield forbidding businesses from meddling with customer deals when a competitor files for chapter 11 protection.</td>

      <td>Florine Stettheimer’s wry 1942 ‘The Cathedrals of Art’ sends up the city’s storied museums and the elites in their orbit.</td>
      <td>She was the society insider and the artistic outlier. Florine Stettheimer (1871-1944) gathered about her the most fervent modernists of the 1920s and ’30s—the likes of Marcel Duchamp, Alfred Stieglitz, Georgia O’Keeffe, Virgil Thomson and Gertrude Stein—whose intellectual and aesthetic energies shaped their era. As a painter she discarded all the prevailing definitions of modernism and painted just as she pleased. She invented her own visual language—purposefully naïve, sly, theatrical and allusive. It both celebrated and mocked her own rarefied milieu—upper-class bohemian life in Manhattan between the world wars.<br />Her sensibility is on full display in the four satirical allegories created between 1929 and 1942 of Manhattan’s secular “shrines” of cosmopolitan life—Broadway, Fifth Avenue, Wall Street and Art. In the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, they are considered her master works. These symbol-packed fantasies are populated with fond and sardonic likenesses of individuals instantly recognizable to a contemporary audience. Worldly and witty, they are comedies of manners. She called them “Cathedrals.”<br />“The Cathedrals of Art,” the last in the series, was the world within New York she knew best—the Met, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art. She stages them as a theatrical triptych of the art establishment against which the newly formed American avant-garde struggles to gain a foothold.<br />Stettheimer gloried in artifice, mingling reality and fantasy. Her style is gossamer, alive with joyful reds, pinks and yellows accented with black and dark blue and thick strokes of gold on a radiant white ground. The scene has the noise and color and light of a comic opera in which many incidents occur simultaneously. But beneath the disarming froth there is rigor and structure. Peopled with sinuous miniature portraits of New York art world luminaries, each smugly ensconced in his or her own orbit, it parodies both the art establishment’s insularity and the self-consciousness of American modernism desperate for establishment acceptance.<br />She loathed pretention and no one escaped her elegant ridicule, including herself. She appears at the lower right labeled as commère, the gossip, under a gold-trimmed canopy, self-mockingly dressed as a bride in white, at last grown young (she was then in her 70s and never married). Opposite is her compère, the master of ceremonies. He is the interior decorator Robert Locher, in the pose of Apollo but dressed like a waiter. In the foreground, at the foot of the Met’s grand red-carpeted staircase, new American Art in the guise of a naked infant drawing a picture is being ushered into this High Temple of Art.</td>

The names that she was called along the way include The Iron Butterfly, Fancy Nancy, The Evita of Bel-Air, Mommie Dearest, The Ice Queen and Attila the Hen.<br />When the future first couple met in late 1949, Ronald Reagan was a broken man—literally. He showed up for their first date leaning on two canes, after having spent months in traction from an accident that shattered his thighbone in a half dozen places.<br />Spiritually, Reagan was in what he described as a “deep freeze.” He was approaching middle age and his movie career, never particularly illustrious, was hitting bottom. His first wife, Jane Wyman, had gotten bored with him and walked out, taking their two children with her. And he carried with him the emotional scar tissue of his precarious childhood as the son of an alcoholic.<br />“Then along came Nancy Davis,” he would later say, “and saved my soul.”</td>

      <td>President would raise discretionary spending by 8.4% to $1.52 trillion with focus on Democratic priorities</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden is seeking more funding for education, healthcare, research and renewable energy next year in a $1.52 trillion spending plan reflecting his vision of an expansive federal government that tackles issues ranging from climate change to racial inequality.<br />The preliminary plan released Friday by the White House would raise discretionary spending by 8.4%, or $118 billion, from the $1.4 trillion authorized last year, excluding emergency measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Discretionary spending is the part of the budget that Congress shapes through the appropriations process.<br />Nondefense spending would rise 16% next fiscal year to $769.4 billion. Spending on defense would increase 1.7% to $753 billion—much less than Republicans are likely to support but more than called for by progressives, who pushed for cuts during the Trump administration.<br />The proposal fulfills some of Mr. Biden’s campaign promises, including more money for schools in high-poverty areas, cancer research and investments to address climate change. It drew immediate opposition from some Republican lawmakers, who called it an intrusive expansion of federal power.<br />The request would lift nondefense spending as a share of gross domestic product to 3.3%, roughly in line with its average over the past 30 years, officials said. It will be followed later this spring by a full budget proposal that includes mandatory spending programs such as Social Security, tax increases and the impact over the next decade on deficits, debt and the economy.</td>

      <td>A Wharton study says wages will fall.</td>
      <td>Sometimes the president calls his next proposed spending blowout an “infrastructure” bill and sometimes he calls it a “jobs” program. The Biden plan may end up destroying plenty of both. A new analysis of the president’s “American Jobs Plan” from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School finds that over the next decade the Biden scheme would reduce U.S. economic growth, capital stock, wages and hours worked. But there is something that the plan would increase—federal debt. In short, it’s a disaster for U.S. investors, workers and taxpayers.<br />The Wharton crew doesn’t think the results would get all that much better in succeeding years, with one significant exception. The analysis does see a benign impact on the federal budget after 2031 because the plan’s spending is scheduled to end while the new taxes are intended to last forever. But how often do massive Washington subsidy schemes fail to get renewed by Congress?<br />Whether or not one expects Washington to suddenly embrace spending discipline in 2031, the private economy will continue to suffer, according to the Wharton projection. The authors note that the tax provisions discourage investment, and therefore they offer the following forecast:<br />This may be the end of the brief and bizarre argument that the Biden spending splurge would be a job creator. The trouble seems to have started last week with a suspect claim from the president:<br />The boast was highly misleading because even if one buys the analysis from the source cited by the White House—a report from government-friendly economist Mark Zandi and a colleague at Moody’s Analytics—their report also forecast that more than 16 million jobs would be created if the plan did not pass and Mr. Biden just left the economy alone.</td>

Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has said his administration is discussing the creation of a standardized record for people to show they have been vaccinated. In Texas, Gov.

Andrew Cuomo introduced Excelsior Pass, a program that allows people to prove their vaccination or Covid-19 status via smartphone app or printout. Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order last month prohibiting businesses from requiring patrons or employees to provide documentation certifying Covid-19 vaccination.
