Bernie Sanders, (I., Vt.) the chairman of the Budget Committee, called Ms. Tanden late Tuesday night to tell her about the postponement, one person familiar with the conversation said.</td>

      <td>Several states and countries require visitors to show a negative Covid-19 test or face a quarantine. Do-it-yourself kits are the easiest solution, but just make sure you’re using the right kind.</td>
      <td>SPRING IS ALMOST here, and if your escape fantasies run to more than a short drive to Aunt Susie’s in the Poconos, odds are you’ll be booking a Covid-19 test along with your air tickets. Many destinations—Hawaii, Maine, most of the Caribbean and even Aspen, Colo.—will let you avoid a quarantine if you’ve recently tested negative for the virus. But you might need to submit to multiple tests during your getaway. A post-arrival screen is required in some places, including Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jordan and Rwanda. If you’re abroad, the U.S. State Department specifies that everyone returning to the U.S. show proof of a negative Covid-19 test. Although more people are getting inoculated against the virus, a vaccine alone won’t ensure access to most destinations, including the U.S.<br />One way to avoid endless clinic visits? Self-administered Covid tests you can take at home or in your hotel. Last year the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began greenlighting DIY tests under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), while other options come with a seal of approval from airlines: Delta, for example, has teamed with Azova (azovahealth.com/test/delta), which offers home saliva tests for travelers for $119 or $115 at some  Costco  locations. Both require a video observation call during the actual test, insisted upon by some destinations. You can even double up on kits, packing one in your bag in case you need a second one.<br />Hawaii has also begun a pilot program with biometrics company Clear, whose Health Pass app lets travelers access at-home tests, as well as in-person test locations, from a list of approved providers. The app also allows users to whisk results directly to the airline on which they’re flying to the Aloha state.<br />Other home test services include LabCorp’s Pixel and Vault, to which the  JetBlue  website refers fliers. Customers sign up online to get the test kit and a return envelope to send the sample—nasal swab or saliva, depending on the type you order—back to the lab. Results are usually posted within 48 to 72 hours after you’ve taken the test.<br />Take care that your test meets the requirements at your destination; many request a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) lab test, although the more rapid antigen version is now more widely accepted. An even faster way to dispense with testing might soon be available: The FDA has recently approved new tests that will deliver results at home in 30 minutes—eliminating the agonizing wait for a timely result. As of now, however, it’s unclear when—or if—they’ll be accepted by travel destinations.</td>

      <td>Lucid Motors has a better claim than most to be the next Tesla, but Reddit-reading investors in the company taking it public are looking too far into an uncertain future</td>
      <td>Is electric-vehicle company Lucid Motors worth $11.75 billion, $24 billion or $57 billion? The one thing investors can be sure of is that the lower the valuation they buy at, the better their chances of making returns.<br />Lucid, one of the most promising startups trying to follow Tesla’s lead in EVs, announced a merger late Monday with Churchill Capital IV or CCIV, a special-purpose acquisition company founded by Michael Klein. Bloomberg reported talks last month, and since then the market value of CCIV, which consists of $2.1 billion in cash, has ballooned to $9.1 billion amid much discussion on Reddit. As the deal allocated CCIV shareholders 16.1% of Lucid’s equity, the implied market value of the combined companies is now roughly $57 billion—even excluding the impact of shares and warrants held by Michael Klein and his team that are due to vest.<br />That valuation, which compares to about $45 billion for  Ford Motor ,  was even higher before the transaction was officially announced: CCIV shares plunged 39% Tuesday. It was a rough day for Tesla’s stock too, particularly in the morning, as investors weighed the prospect of rising interest rates and a consequent “rotation” away from expensive tech shares. Yet the terms of the transaction—notably some valuation numbers backed by hardheaded negotiations—may also have helped sober CCIV investors up.<br />CCIV agreed to pay $11.75 billion for Lucid’s existing business. Add the blank-check company’s $2.1 billion in cash and another $2.5 billion in cash from institutional investors and you get postdeal equity of $16.3 billion. But the company also cited a valuation of $24 billion. This is because the institutional investors agreed to buy into CCIV at $15 a share—a 50% premium to its net asset value but far below its current share price. Apply that premium to the entire equity and you get roughly $24 billion.<br />What all these numbers spell out is that different investors are buying Lucid at different prices. Those who invested in CCIV at the outset are paying the least. Institutions such as Fidelity and  BlackRock  that are getting shares through the secondary fundraising are paying more. And anyone who buys CCIV stock now is paying by far the most, even after Tuesday’s correction.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A decision on whether raising the minimum wage as part of President Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief package is acceptable under the Senate’s rules is expected as soon as Wednesday, kicking off what could be a fraught negotiation among Democrats on the provision.<br />Staff for both Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans are set to meet Wednesday morning with Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough over the proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, a plank of Mr. Biden’s relief plan.<br />Democrats are using a process called reconciliation to pass the aid package with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes required for most legislation. But reconciliation also comes with Senate rules on what proposals can be approved under the special procedure—including that the provision be directly tied to the budget. The nonpartisan parliamentarian will hear arguments from both parties and is expected to make a ruling on Wednesday or Thursday on the question.<br />A favorable ruling from the parliamentarian on raising the minimum wage through reconciliation will open the door for lawmakers to increase the federal minimum wage for the first time since 2009. But then Democrats will have to agree on exactly how to do so.<br />“It will be a whole caucus discussion because you still have to have 50 votes,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), a proponent of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, said.</td>

      <td>It was about 7:30 a.m. on a Friday when I asked the new Echo Show 10 to read me the news. I walked toward the coffee machine, bleary eyed, and poured my morning cup. When I finally looked up in the Echo Show’s direction, it had turned to meet my gaze. As I walked back over, the screen panned again. In the morning light, I could see the device’s pea-size, motion-detecting camera challenging me to a staring contest I’d never win.<br />After experiencing the auto-tracking technology for the first time, I felt a mix of awe and dread. Not only can  Amazon ’s  devices see and hear us—now, they can follow us, too. It doesn’t have wheels. It’s more like a dog who watches you get kibble from the pantry as he sits like a good boy.<br />The Echo Show 10, which begins shipping Thursday, has a 10.1-inch screen connected by a robot arm. At $250, it’s also the company’s most expensive Echo.<br />Like other Alexa devices, this one can set timers and control your smart lightbulbs. And as a speaker, it sounds great. But the main idea is that its screen is visible whenever you look up, displaying your  Netflix  show or the next step in a recipe. And if you’re multitasking on a video call, the camera and robot arm will keep you in frame.<br />At first, the autonomously moving screen was more creepy than cool. After a few days, that unnerving feeling dissipated. At some point, the robo-screen actually started to make sense.</td>

The Portland, Ore.-based company serves some 6,500 clients across 60 countries, including the Los Angeles County Public Works Department, New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection and  Balfour Beatty  PLC.<br />One of the people familiar with the deal said that Innovyze has roughly tripled its annual revenue under EQT’s ownership.<br />EQT created the water infrastructure business in 2017 through the combination of two technology units it had acquired out of larger corporations: XP Solutions and Innovyze. At the time, the firm was attracted to what it saw as a relatively low level of technology adoption among water utilities compared with other industries such as healthcare or finance, according to partner Arvindh Kumar, who joined EQT in early 2020 to lead the firm’s U.S. investments in technology, media and telecommunications.<br />“We thought that over a longer period of time it [would be] a very attractive market where there would be growth and adoption of technology solutions to help utilities,” Mr. Kumar said.</td>

      <td>Concerns about Slack acquisition have weighed on the stock ahead of year-end results</td>
      <td>Salesforce . com has been in the doghouse with investors before. The way out this time will require a bit more attention to the bottom line.<br />The cloud software pioneer that is perennially in growth and deal mode announced its biggest move yet three months ago. That was the acquisition of  Slack Technologies —a messaging and collaboration platform for businesses that is popular but has yet to turn a profit. At $27.7 billion, Slack was nearly twice the size of Salesforce’s second-largest deal, which was the acquisition of Tableau Software in mid-2019. The deal also capped a run in which Salesforce acquired 28 companies in a five-year span, with reported values totaling $54.3 billion, according to FactSet.<br />Slack, in other words, was just the latest in a long string of deals that have grown more expensive over the years. But investors have taken a particularly dim view of the transaction. Salesforce shares have shed nearly 10% of their value since The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks between the two companies on Nov. 25. That contrasts with a 6% gain for the S&P 500 Software & Services Group and a 17% rise by the BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index over the same period. The price tag represented about 26 times Slack’s projected revenue for the next 12 months—more than twice the multiple paid for Tableau—and Salesforce didn’t even face competition on the deal, according to regulatory filings detailing the background of the merger.<br />That provides a challenging setup coming into Salesforce’s fiscal fourth-quarter results, scheduled for Thursday afternoon. The quarter is typically a strong period for the business, historically representing at least 45% of the company’s billings for the full fiscal year. But investors have been concerned about the rationale for the Slack deal, and the impact it will have on Salesforce’s margins. Slack is projected to show about $47 million in operating losses for the fiscal year ended January. An investor survey by Bernstein Research in December showed 84% of respondents believed the deal to be “value destructive” for Salesforce investors.<br />Salesforce already included Slack in its initial projection of 21% revenue growth for the fiscal year ending next January, so the potential for further upside from top-line growth guidance may be limited.</td>

      <td>Mortgage rates reached their highest level since November last week, cooling off home purchase and refinance applications ahead of the all-important spring selling season.<br />The average rate on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 2.81% in the week ended Feb. 18, the highest since the second week of November, according to mortgage-finance giant  Freddie Mac .  A measure of mortgage applications fell 11.4% over the same week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.<br />Improving Covid-19 vaccination rates in the U.S. and expectations of a large federal stimulus package in the coming weeks drove benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields, which are closely tied to mortgage rates, to their largest weekly gains in more than a month last week. Demand in safe-haven assets such as government bonds weakens when investors feel optimistic about the economy.<br />“Higher rates are a signal of expectations of faster growth and a stronger job market ahead,” said Mike Fratantoni, the MBA’s chief economist. “This last week, rates have turned faster than many people had anticipated.”<br />Rising rates sometimes prompt borrowers to put their mortgage plans on hold for a few weeks, Mr. Fratantoni said. Measures of purchase and refinance activity fell 11.6% and 11.3%, respectively, in the week ended Feb. 19, according to MBA data.</td>

Her decision is expected Wednesday or Thursday, according to lawmakers and aides.<br />Reconciliation is designed to help lawmakers pass legislation tied to the budget quickly with just 51 votes, rather than the 60 required for most bills to advance. That means Democrats will be able to pass the bill without any GOP votes, so long as they don’t lose any Democrats.<br />To qualify for the special fast-track procedures, measures have to be directly tied to the budget. Specifically, they have to have a meaningful fiscal impact that can’t be “merely incidental” to the policy proposal. If not, the provision can be challenged under the “Byrd rule,” named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.).<br />The Byrd rule also prevents any provision of the bill from adding to the deficit beyond the bill’s budgetary window, unless lawmakers find a way to offset its cost through the committee that has jurisdiction over that provision.</td>

Coca-Cola, in particular, is gearing up for a contentious constitutional fight against the government, with $12 billion on the line.<br />Others—including  Newell Brands Inc.  and  Maxim Integrated Products Inc. —stand to lose millions under Treasury Department regulations issued in 2019, but say they remain confident the rules will eventually be thrown out and aren’t recording the costs.<br />“For them to say the tax authority has got it all wrong, that’s a pretty bold statement,” said Jack Ciesielski, an accounting expert and owner of R.G. Associates Inc., an investment research firm. The more conservative approach is to recognize the cost, note the legal dispute and reverse the cost later if the company prevails, he said.</td>

But it also stems from how, even as the Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc, those stocks did so well.<br />With the daily tally of new Covid-19 cases falling rapidly, millions of vaccine doses going into arms each week and another round of government support looking as if it is on its way, a return to something like normal in the months ahead is looking more and more likely. And with that prospect of recovery, bond investors have become less enamored with the safety of long-term Treasurys, pushing rates higher. The 10-year note’s yield is now 1.36%, compared with 0.88% just three months ago, marking its highest level in a year.<br />For most U.S. companies, the all-clear signal that the Treasury market has started sounding is a good thing. As Americans get back to doing things like eating out at restaurants, heading out on vacations and going to the mall, sales could flourish. Considering how much money has built up in a lot of people’s bank accounts during the pandemic and how much pent-up demand there is for all the things they did before the pandemic, there could be a bit of a boom.<br />For the shares of those companies, on the other hand, the rise in long-term rates provides a bit of a challenge: The higher that yields go, the more competitive bonds are with stocks. The challenge is hardly insurmountable, however, considering that the better economy that yields are heralding makes for better profits. That is why as often as not in recent years, periods of rising Treasury yields coincide with stocks rising, too.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—Australian legislation effectively requiring  Facebook Inc.  and Google to pay news outlets for content cleared its last major parliamentary hurdle, capping a multiyear effort that could set a global precedent for regulating the tech giants’ relations with publishers.<br />As its spat with the Australian government over the proposed media code deepened, Facebook last week followed through on a threat to remove news from its platform in the country. After the government agreed to small changes to the legislation, Facebook said Tuesday that the news would be restored.<br />In general, the code compels tech companies and news publishers to submit to binding arbitration if they can’t reach a deal on payment. The amendments announced Tuesday include requiring an additional round of negotiation before binding arbitration kicks in, as well as more acknowledgment of any deals Facebook reaches with publishers on its own.<br />Alphabet Inc.’s  Google also initially opposed the legislation, at one time threatening to shut down its search engine in Australia. Recently, though, it opted instead to sign content deals with a number of publishers—including  News Corp ,  which owns big newspapers in Australia as well as Dow Jones & Co., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal.<br />News Corp has supported the law.</td>

      <td>Competition in the electricity-supply business promised reliable power at a more affordable cost</td>
      <td>Texas’s deregulated electricity market, which was supposed to provide reliable power at a lower price, left millions in the dark last week. For two decades, its customers have paid more for electricity than state residents who are served by traditional utilities, a Wall Street Journal analysis has found.<br />Nearly 20 years ago, Texas shifted from using full-service regulated utilities to generate power and deliver it to consumers. The state deregulated power generation, creating the system that failed last week. And it required nearly 60% of consumers to buy their electricity from one of many retail power companies, rather than a local utility.<br />Those deregulated Texas residential consumers paid $28 billion more for their power since 2004 than they would have paid at the rates charged to the customers of the state’s traditional utilities, according to the Journal’s analysis of data from the federal Energy Information Administration.<br />The crisis last week was driven by the power producers. Now that power has largely been restored, attention has turned to retail electric companies, a few of which are hitting consumers with steep bills. Power prices surged to the market price cap of $9,000 a megawatt hour for several days during the crisis, a feature of the state’s system designed to incentivize power plants to supply more juice. Some consumers who chose variable rate power plans from retail power companies are seeing the big bills.<br />None of this was supposed to happen under deregulation. Backers of competition in the electricity-supply business promised it would lower prices for consumers who could shop around for the best deals, just as they do for cellphone service. The system would be an improvement over monopoly utilities, which have little incentive to innovate and provide better service to customers, supporters of deregulation said.</td>

Swipe fees, which merchants pay when a customer pays by card, are often higher on online purchases.<br />The swipe fees, known as interchange fees in industry parlance, are a perpetual source of contention between merchants and card companies. Though invisible to consumers, they are glaring to merchants, which often end up paying fees of about 2% of their customers’ credit-card purchases. The fees are set by the card networks, such as Visa and Mastercard. Merchants pay them to the banks that issue the cards.<br />Cash use as a share of U.S. payments has been declining for years, but merchants say Covid-19 has accelerated the shift. Even customers who are shopping in stores are shunning cash during the pandemic, which also means more swipe fees for businesses.<br />Savage Race, a small business that organizes obstacle-course races, has seen sales plummet during the coronavirus.

Now, some governors are proposing tax increases.<br />Prominent proposals include calls to raise billions of dollars across several states through taxes on the income and capital gains of higher earners.<br />Unlike the federal government, states generally can’t borrow to plug budget holes. After accounting for existing federal aid, states might need to come up with about $56 billion in spending cuts or revenue increases to balance their budgets through the fiscal year that ends in most states in June 2022, according to an estimate from Moody’s Analytics.<br />Budgetary pressures vary greatly among states, despite calls for more federal aid in general and tax hikes in some locales. In New York, state revenue collected from April through December 2020 was 4.1% lower than in the year-earlier period, according to data from the Urban Institute think tank.<br />In New Jersey, the drop was 2.4%. With tax revenue outperforming earlier projections, Gov. Phil Murphy on Tuesday proposed making a full payment to the state’s pension system for the first time since 1996. California has done even better, with revenue collections growing 1.2%, boosted by strong earnings for high-income taxpayers and a rallying stock market.</td>

Investors said a rise in government bond yields, driven by improving growth prospects and rising inflation expectations, has accelerated a rotation out of the tech stocks that led markets higher during the pandemic, and into the stocks best placed to benefit from an end to lockdowns.<br />“This really is a function of economies reopening,” said Brian O’Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum Investment Funds. “Bond yields are rising because of good vaccination rates in the U.S. and U.K. and it’s prompting a simple rotation away from everything that did well last year, the stay-at-home stocks, to the ones that didn’t, the go-outside stocks.”<br />“It’s a good story in some ways, in that the market is trying to price in that economies are going to reopen,” he added.</td>

      <td>Myanmar’s coup highlights the awkward dynamics for foreign businesses involved in countries where the armed forces have their own business interests</td>
      <td>The military seizure of power in Myanmar doesn’t just have political and diplomatic implications, but economic ones too.<br />Though rare in the West, heavy military involvement in nondefense parts of the economy is commonplace in many parts of the world. The recent events in Myanmar show some of the awkward dynamics for foreign businesses that get involved in countries where the armed forces have their own business interests, and how the military can be a drag on prosperity.<br />From the outside, it might seem obvious that military involvement in the economy is a bad thing: Generals aren’t businessmen and may use their clout to intimidate potential competitors or otherwise extract economic rents. That isn’t accurate in every case. During President Park Chung-hee’s military dictatorship in South Korea, an authoritarian central government facilitated development even when most of the actual business was technically in private hands. A rich seam of contracts for material during the Vietnam War helped to fuel the growth of some chaebols, such as Hyundai.<br />But in other cases, it is clear that skeptics’ instincts are pretty much on the money. In Egypt, for example, the military directly or indirectly employs millions of civilians, but without any concrete strategy for development—a more clear-cut case of rent extraction from the productive parts of the economy. Research published by the Center for Comparative and International Studies based on more than 100 countries suggests that benefits of GDP growth from democratization decline when the military has more political power, and are fully erased in cases where the armed forces are particularly influential.<br />The truth is that there are far more situations in the world where a powerful military contributes to Egypt-like outcomes than South Korea-like outcomes. Myanmar is certainly one of the former. The country’s GDP per capita, adjusted for purchasing-power parity, was a little over $5,000 last year, less than half of Vietnamese and Indonesian levels, two countries that aren’t wealthy even by regional standards.</td>

      <td>A showdown in Australia is being watched as a test case for the rest of the world</td>
      <td>Facebook Inc.  on Tuesday agreed to restore news to its platform in Australia, following a five-day blackout that came amid a standoff with the country’s government over a proposal that would force tech companies to pay news publishers for content.<br />The current showdown, which also involves  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google, represents the boiling over of a long-simmering question around the world: Should big tech platforms have to pay publishers for the news articles that populate their sites?<br />Google and Facebook say they help publishers by delivering traffic. In their view, requiring the tech companies to pay to display news content violates the principles of open linking that make the web work. Publishers say that the primary reason they don’t get paid is the power imbalance between them and the tech platforms, whose role in the distribution of their stories is so important that publishers feel they have little choice but to assent to tech companies’ terms.<br />Copyright laws differ by country, but in the U.S. the news headlines and snippets turned up in Google searches are typically considered a fair use of that content under copyright law—meaning that a company can display those snippets without having to negotiate a license fee from the copyright holder. Determining what should count as fair use is complicated; it includes weighing such factors as whether a news snippet on a tech platform could be considered a replacement for the full article, which would harm the publisher.<br />Whether Google’s and Facebook’s current use of news content is fair use isn’t known because the courts haven’t tried a case. A key legal decision from 2007 offers a guiding principle for what copyright lawyers expect today. In that case, Perfect 10, a publisher of pornography, had sued Google, claiming the thumbnail photographs indexed in Google’s image search had hurt its business. The Ninth Circuit sided with Google, primarily because it saw Google’s search engine as a “pointer” to Perfect 10’s content, not a replacement for it.</td>

The matter also raises questions about which publishers should get paid for news content and how much.<br />Facebook’s deal with Australia gives it a path to avoid required payments to publishers for news content, so long as the company works toward reaching agreements with publishers on its own accord.<br />“We appreciate the government has created flexibility to move forward making deals with publishers, while giving us 30 days’ notice before a designation,” said Campbell Brown, Facebook’s vice president of global news partnerships. If Facebook’s negotiations with individual Australian publishers fail to satisfy the government, the company could reimpose its news ban rather than be forced to comply with the new law’s terms for setting payments.<br />“I am hopeful there will not be a need for that step,” Ms. Brown said.</td>

      <td>MEXICO CITY—Mexico’s lower house of congress passed a controversial bill that gives priority to the state-owned power utility over private generators, threatening to overturn the electricity market and putting billions of dollars of private investments in jeopardy.<br />Lower house lawmakers voted 304-179 to pass the bill that cancels key parts of the 2013 energy overhaul giving private and foreign investors a greater role in the electricity sector.<br />The ruling Morena Party backed the legislation, which was submitted early this month by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a fervent opponent of the energy opening made under his predecessor.<br />Mexico’s main opposition party, the conservative National Action Party, said the changes would push up generation costs and electricity rates, prove detrimental to the environment and unleash international arbitration and constitutional challenges.<br />Opposition lawmakers objected to a number of articles in the bill, although the objections were expected to be overruled by the majority. The bill will then go to the Senate, where approval is almost guaranteed, said Senate Majority Leader Ricardo Monreal.</td>

      <td>Biden’s regulators are ignoring the electrical grid’s vulnerability.</td>
      <td>You’d think the Texas blackouts would trigger some soul-searching about the vulnerability of America’s electrical grid. Not in today’s hothouse of climate politics. The Biden Administration is already moving to stop an examination of grid vulnerability to promote unreliable renewable energy sources.<br />Regulators have been warning for years that the grid is becoming shakier as cheap natural gas and heavily subsidized renewables replace steady coal and nuclear baseload power. “The nation’s power grid will be stressed in ways never before experienced” due to “an unprecedented resource-mix change,” the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned in 2011.<br />It added: “Environmental regulations are shown to be the number one risk to reliability over the next one to five years.” But the Obama Federal Energy Regulatory Commission(FERC) refused to consider how climate policies would affect reliability. Since 2011 about 90 gigawatts (GW) of coal capacity have shut down, replaced by some 120 GW of wind and solar and 60 GW of gas power capacity.<br />But renewables don’t generate power around-the-clock as gas, nuclear and coal do. Gas plants depend on just-in-time fuel deliveries, which aren’t reliable in extreme weather. Government-made pipeline bottlenecks constrain deliveries in the Northeast. Liberals also say Texas could have better weathered the Arctic blast if its grid didn’t rely almost entirely on in-state power.<br />But the Southwest Power Pool, north of Texas, and the Midwest power grid—both of which rely heavily on wind backed by gas—also experienced power outages last week due to declining surging demand, wind production and gas shortages. California relies on gas and imports to back up its solar power. But last summer California couldn’t get enough power from its neighbors amid a heat wave that strained the entire Western grid. Hydropower from the Northwest and coal from Utah couldn’t stop blackouts.</td>

      <td>A new journal from students who refuse to be cancelled.</td>
      <td>Most college administrators are no doubt exhausted by constant student demands that range from the type of cereal served in the dining hall to the latest intersectional fad. So those running the University of Chicago must be pleasantly surprised by the arrival of Chicago Thinker on their campus this school year. It’s an online journal by conservative and libertarian students who refuse to be canceled.<br />Their mission statement makes the point: “We demand not to be coddled. Embracing the experience of unfettered inquiry and free expression is precisely the point of these years of intense study: to rigorously confront and challenge our most deeply-held beliefs—and to emerge from the experience as more thoughtful, informed human beings.”<br />They build on a firm foundation. In 2015 the university released a statement reaffirming its commitment to “free, robust, and uninhibited debate and deliberation.” In 2016 the university’s incoming freshman received a letter informing them that “we do not support so-called trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial and we do not condone the creation of intellectual safe spaces where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.”<br />The Chicago Thinker’s latest posts include stories on the “insane COVID rules and snitch culture” at today’s universities, a definition of conservatism offered “in defiance of egregious caricatures,” and a piece on “how leftism ruined ‘Stargirl,’” a superhero TV series based on the character from DC Comics. Good for the Chicago Thinker—and even more for the university that promises never to coddle the students running the publication.</td>

Grid failures will only become more common as the left continues to sabotage America’s No. 1 power source.<br />Prior to starting graduate school, I worked as an engineer on natural-gas pipelines in Texas. I saw how a radical, antiscience faction on the political left does everything in its power to make building, operating and maintaining gas pipelines prohibitively difficult. Pandering to these activists and voters, Democratic leaders impede natural-gas projects through punitive regulations, endless reviews and flat-out refusals to approve new projects. Ironically, those quickest to blame natural gas for this current crisis in Texas are the ones who have worked the hardest to create barriers to the improvement, modernization and expansion of America’s pipelines.</td>

Ms. James launched the investigation into Mr. Prude’s death thereafter.<br />On March 23, Rochester Police Department officers took Mr. Prude, who had a history of mental illness, into custody after responding to reports of a person acting erratically. Mr. Prude died in a hospital seven days later.<br />The Monroe County Office of the Medical Examiner ruled Mr. Prude’s death a homicide.

      <td>Gov. Lamont makes a smart decision to base eligibility on age.</td>
      <td>‘I’m going to focus on the old business motto, KISS: Keep it simple, stupid.” That’s how Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont put it Monday in announcing his decision to base Covid-19 vaccine eligibility strictly on age. The more states prioritize social “equity,” the more complicated and inequitable vaccine distribution becomes.<br />After seniors older than age 65, Connecticut had planned to vaccinate “essential workers” and younger people with underlying health conditions like diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recommended these groups be prioritized to “mitigate health inequities” and “promote justice.” Younger minorities are more likely to be “essential workers” and have comorbidities.<br />But as Mr. Lamont explained, “A lot of complications result from states that tried to finely slice the salami and it got very complicated to administer. . . The CDC said grocery and food service workers [get priority]. Then we started getting calls of, ‘I’m not in a grocery [store] but I’m in a convenience store and it’s a convenience store that serves . . . we have doughnuts, we have coffee, we have food.’ How about, ‘I’m a big box store, but I also have food; I think we should all be prioritized as well.’ . . . Those are the type of questions we had. And it was very difficult.”<br />Or how about people a few pounds short of the public-health definition of obesity? If they ate more doughnuts, could they qualify?<br />The Democratic Governor is right that complexity is the enemy of speed. It’s also the enemy of equity. Decisions about who is or isn’t an “essential worker” are arbitrary. Many people in their early 60s are retired, including large numbers of public-safety workers.</td>

      <td>Investigators are trying to understand interplay between broken fan blades and engine cowling, which was ripped away</td>
      <td>The midair breakdown of a jet engine that spewed a trail of metal over a Colorado town is putting regulatory focus on the design and strength of engine coverings.<br />Four minutes into the Honolulu-bound United Airlines flight from Denver on Saturday, pilots and passengers heard a loud bang, and the plane’s right engine began vibrating, according to the National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary analysis of the cockpit’s voice recorder. Within 20 minutes, the plane had landed on the runway back at Denver International Airport, with no injuries to anyone on the ground or aboard the plane.<br />However, large pieces of debris plunged from the sky, landing in yards and a soccer field. Photos and videos taken by passengers show the airplane’s right engine, stripped of its front coverings, oscillating and in flames.<br />Investigators have homed in on a fan blade that had weakened over time and broke off at its base. That fast-spinning blade remnant appears to have sheared a second blade roughly in half. But investigators are still trying to understand why the engine’s front external cover, known as the cowling, was then ripped away, according to NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt. Something similar happened in a handful of other engine failures caused by broken fan blades in recent years.<br />“Certainly, we don’t expect the cowling to separate like that,” Mr. Sumwalt said this week, during a briefing with reporters. He added that the safety board’s investigators would examine the engine’s maintenance and inspection records.</td>

      <td>Stories of decline, reform and survival in a post-Fukushima Japan already hobbled by economic stagnation and an aging society.</td>
      <td>Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, Japan was buffeted by crises. Economic stagnation left the country with dim prospects. An aging society compounded the problem. Younger Japanese barely remember the era of wealth that catapulted their nation to the world’s No. 2 position.<br />Nature struck an even deeper blow to the country’s psyche. On March 11, 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake occurred off the northeastern coast of Honshu, triggering a devastating tsunami. More than a quarter million people were displaced and nearly 20,000 were killed. A meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant followed. The world watched in horror as the greater Tokyo area, with a population of 38 million, seemed at risk. The Japanese people averted that nightmare, but 10 years later the trauma of what could have been still lingers.<br />In “Every Human Intention: Japan in the New Century,” American journalist Dreux Richard offers an eclectic collage of stories about Japan in the decade since the earthquake. Three complex dilemmas organize Mr. Richard’s idea of Japan: decline, diaspora (or immigration) and reform.<br />The strongest in the series are the stories from Japan’s increasingly depopulated rural towns. Mr. Richard visits the port city of Wakkanai, on the northernmost tip of the country. Once a thriving economy, Wakkanai has declined as the region’s fishing stock was depleted and trade with the nearby Russian island of Sakhalin evaporated. Mr. Richard presents a rich array of voices to capture the city’s public-policy challenges as well as the plight of its elderly. Efforts at revitalization are regularly rebuffed. “I’m annoyed by the notion that people in Wakkanai should feel chastened,” laments the city’s former mayor, Yokota Kōichi, “that a city in decline should dare nothing.”<br />To explore the difficulties faced by Japan’s African immigrants—which officially number almost 22,000 but are estimated to be up to twice that with visa overstayers—Mr. Richard relies mostly on Prosper Anyalechi, a permanent resident from Nigeria who has been in Tokyo since 1991, to tell his own story. Expectations for Mr. Richard’s insights ought to be high, as the author reported extensively on the subject for the Japan Times newspaper between 2011 and 2016. According to Mr. Richard, few African migrants have more than a tenuous claim to a home in Japan; most live in isolation away from the society that hosts them. They have limited access to legal visas, and many who seek opportunity there end up staying beyond the term of their permits.</td>

Nor is it merely an attempt to prohibit employment discrimination against sexual minorities. A 2020 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court already does that.<br />The Equality Act would go much further by making it illegal to distinguish “identity” from biology and thereby prioritize transgender people over women. By erasing sex as a distinct legal category, the measure threatens to open up female-only spaces and opportunities designed to increase representation for girls to biological men, which can endanger the safety of women and girls.<br />The Equality Act would threaten the existence of women’s prisons, public-school girls’ locker rooms, and women’s and girls’ sports teams. It would limit freedom of speech, freedom of association, accurate data collection, and scientific inquiry. It would threaten the rights of physicians who doubt the wisdom of performing life-changing, reproduction-limiting procedures, and parents who seek to protect their minor children from such treatment.</td>

      <td>The ex-senator had said he might seek the Republican nomination</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Former Republican Sen. David Perdue of Georgia said he wouldn’t seek a return to the Senate in 2022, one week after announcing he was exploring a bid and filing early paperwork to do so.<br />“After much prayer and reflection, Bonnie and I have decided that we will not enter the race for the United States Senate in Georgia in 2022. This is a personal decision, not a political one,” Mr. Perdue said in an email to supporters Tuesday, referring to his wife. “I am confident that whoever wins the Republican primary next year will defeat the Democrat candidate in the general election for this seat, and I will do everything I can to make that happen.”<br />Mr. Perdue lost a runoff race for re-election in January to his Democratic opponent, now-Sen. Jon Ossoff. The runoff was needed because, in Georgia, statewide officials must win more than 50% of the vote—a threshold no Senate candidate cleared in November.<br />In his statement, Mr. Perdue said that he would work with Georgia officials to “correct the inequities in our state laws and election rules.” Top state election officials, many of whom are Republicans, have said the November elections and subsequent runoffs were conducted fairly.<br />The announcement came after Mr. Perdue said last week that he would consider running for the seat now held by Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who defeated Republican Kelly Loeffler in a different runoff last month. Mr. Warnock must run again because his race was a special election to fill the remainder of a term vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson, who retired due to illness. Mr. Ossoff was elected to a full, six-year term.</td>

      <td>Macron and Merkel respond coolly to Biden, and public opinion backs them.</td>
      <td>President Biden set out to declare a triumphant U.S. return to the trans-Atlantic alliance. “America is back,” the president said in his speech this week to the Munich Security Conference. The leaders of France and Germany promptly made it clear that the four years of the Trump presidency had changed the relationship.<br />France’s President Emmanuel Macron renewed his call for Europe’s “strategic autonomy,” which would require the Continent to be prepared to defend itself. Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel bluntly stated that the interests of the U.S. and Europe wouldn’t always converge, which most listeners took as a reference to the European Union’s recent trade pact with China, along with Germany’s determination to complete the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline from Russia. The U.S. may be back, but it can’t expect to reclaim its old seat at the head of the table.<br />Underlying the muted response to Mr. Biden’s speech is what the European Council on Foreign Relations calls a “massive change” in European public opinion toward the U.S. The group’s recent poll finds: “Majorities in key member states now think the US political system is broken, that China will be more powerful than the US within a decade, and that Europeans cannot rely on the US to defend them.”<br />These beliefs are driving fundamental changes in European policy preferences. “Large numbers think Europeans should invest in their own defense,” the poll found, “and look to Berlin rather than Washington as their most important partner. They want to be tougher with the US on economic issues. And, rather than aligning with Washington, they want their countries to stay neutral in a conflict between the US and Russia or China”—a stance endorsed by at least half the electorate in each of the 11 countries surveyed.<br />In every country except Poland and Hungary, pluralities agreed with the statement that after voting for Donald Trump in 2016, the American people can no longer be trusted. In Germany, a majority endorsed this sentiment.</td>

      <td>Hey Australia, the 1830s called and they want their media business model back.<br />It sounds terrible to modern ears, but in the early days of the newspaper industry, the “party press era,” papers were PR organs. Their job was to win elections and capture lucrative government advertising. Australia apparently seeks to create a similar dynamic, albeit with a legal and regulatory cloak thrown over it. Why should we care? Because legislators everywhere are watching closely. They see the same opening to suborn—er, support—a free press made vulnerable by the collapse in digital ad revenues. Our own venerated Sen. Bernie Sanders is among them.<br />Australia’s rationale is disingenuous even by political standards, exploiting the unpopularity of Google and  Facebook  as a foil. No matter how often it is insinuated otherwise, the U.S. internet ad giants do not steal newspaper content; they send millions of readers to newspaper websites every day and help them generate billions of dollars in ad views.<br />The problem is that the advertising these readers see doesn’t pay nearly as well as advertising did in pre-internet days. This isn’t Google’s and Facebook’s fault but Australia’s Parliament nevertheless would put the onus on them to compensate publishers for the fact that their news products, while still valued by readers, no longer are valued quite so highly by advertisers.<br />Google promptly surrendered, recognizing a threat by politicians to dictate its core search results. It agreed to funnel payments to local media owners through a different window, greasing them for participating in a separate project called News Showcase. (The Journal’s publisher is a recipient of such a deal.) This seems to have satisfied the politicians for now.</td>

He survived but required about 100 stitches to close his wounds. Other victims have been less fortunate.<br />In Milwaukee last September, a 36-year-old Hmong American named Ee Lee was sexually assaulted in a city park and died at a hospital from “blunt force trauma to her head.” The suspects fled on bicycles.<br />In San Francisco last month, Vicha Ratanapakdee, 84 and originally from Thailand, was on his regular morning walk when a passerby knocked him to the ground and ran away. Ratanapakdee died from his injuries a few days later. Across the Bay, in Oakland’s Chinatown, police have documented an uptick in assaults, particularly on the elderly. On Jan. 31, a man was caught on camera in separate incidents approaching a 91-year-old man and 55-year-old woman from behind and shoving them to the pavement. The woman lost consciousness.<br />“It’s not unique to Chinatown or to the Asian community, the increase in crime we’ve seen across the city and across the county,” said the district attorney for Alameda County, which includes Oakland, at a news conference earlier this month. “But we have seen in the last several weeks and month a very specific increase in crimes committed against Asians.”</td>

      <td>Jeff Blackburn, a top  Amazon.com Inc.  executive and close aide to Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, is leaving the company after taking a yearlong sabbatical.<br />Mr. Blackburn announced his departure in a memo to the company Tuesday reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. He said he isn’t retiring and would soon share what he will be doing next.<br />“I hope that, on the margin, I pushed [the senior executive] team and Amazon to be even more bold, see around corners, think big,” Mr. Blackburn wrote. “What an amazing 22 years it has been together—I will cherish it, forever.”<br />Mr. Blackburn’s departure comes after a wave of leadership changes at the online commerce giant. Mr. Bezos said earlier this month he would step down as CEO to become executive chairman after heading the company for more than 26 years. Jeff Wilke, a longtime executive and CEO of Amazon’s consumer-facing businesses, is retiring from the company on Monday.<br />Mr. Blackburn and Mr. Wilke were once seen as potential successors to Mr. Bezos. Andy Jassy, who has long headed Amazon’s booming cloud-computing business, is succeeding Mr. Bezos. He is set to start as CEO in the third quarter.</td>

      <td>Arturo Di Modica said he felt sorry for America after the Black Monday crash in October 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank nearly 23%.<br />Using what he said was more than $300,000 of his own money, the Italian-born sculptor created a 7,000-pound bronze bull—composed of 23 pieces welded together—and installed it near the New York Stock Exchange late one night in December 1989. “I saw people who had lost everything and I didn’t like that so I worked to create something beautiful for young Americans,” he said later.<br />The New York police initially looked Mr. Di Modica’s gift bull in the mouth. Noting that he had no permit to install the statue, dubbed Charging Bull, the police hauled it away. A few days later, the city allowed the bull to be placed near the northern tip of Bowling Green park, also in Lower Manhattan. “It was just too good to lose,” said Henry Stern, then commissioner of the city’s parks department.<br />Since then, the statue has amused millions of passersby and startled a few. “I don’t like that cow!” wailed one 3-year-old boy upon seeing it in 2003. It has endured attacks by vandals wielding paint and a metal object. In 2010, another artist swaddled the sculpture in a coat made of yarn.<br />Mr. Di Modica died Feb. 19 in his hometown of Vittoria, Italy. He was 80 and had suffered from cancer and other ailments.</td>

The severity of his injuries is not clear at this time. No cause for the crash, in the Rancho Palos Verdes area, was given, and the vehicle in the single-car wreck suffered “major damage,” according to authorities.<br />While the full extent of Woods’s injuries aren’t known, the accident is the latest chapter in a long series of vehicular mishaps that in the past have knocked him off course in his quest to be golf’s greatest player ever.  His first car accident in 2009 kicked off a sex scandal, and eight years later he was found asleep at the wheel with painkillers in his system. These defined the epic downfall of an athlete who experienced a meteoric rise unlike few others, only for him to be back atop the golf world once again when he won the 2019 Masters.<br />Woods, 45 years old, said in January that he had recently undergone back surgery, the latest in a string of ailments that threw arguably the greatest golfer ever off course. He appeared on TV for an interview over the weekend at the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club in the Los Angeles area, which he hosts, though he didn’t say when he would be healthy enough to return. The car that crashed appeared to be a Genesis vehicle.</td>

      <td>The disease will continue to take a heavy toll even if the shots work, government advisers project</td>
      <td>LONDON—By the middle of this year, all adults in Britain are due to be offered a Covid-19 vaccine in what is on course to be the fastest inoculation rollout in a major Western country. But disease modelers advising the U.K. government recently made a sobering projection: 56,000 more Covid-19 deaths by the summer of next year, even if the country tiptoes out of lockdown and the vaccines work.<br />The study points to the uncomfortable prospect that even with an effective vaccine, the virus will continue to take a toll on society and that some restrictions may have to be periodically reintroduced to control the coronavirus’s spread.<br />The conclusion: Businesses and governments around the world need to prepare to live with Covid-19, accepting that the virus won’t disappear but equally that lockdowns cannot go on forever once hospitalizations are brought down to manageable levels.<br />“We cannot escape the fact that lifting lockdown will result in more cases, more hospitalizations and sadly more deaths,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Parliament on Monday as he mapped out a slow and conditional route out of lockdown. “There is therefore no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain or indeed a zero-Covid world.”<br />The caution doesn’t undermine the value of a successful vaccine rollout. New data released Monday showed that Britain’s vaccination program—which has given at least one shot to more than a third of the country’s 53 million adults—has significantly lowered infections and cut serious illness by even more.</td>

      <td>Blow from Covid-19 pandemic to state’s fiscal health is smaller than feared</td>
      <td>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is proposing a $44.8 billion budget that boosts spending on education, economic-development programs and pension payments, as state revenue collections continue to outperform the dire predictions made at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The governor’s spending plan calls for about $200 million to help jump-start the economy with grants and loans for small businesses and other initiatives and an increase in education spending of more than $600 million. Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, also has proposed making a $6.4 billion pension payment for the fiscal year beginning in July, which would be the first full payment to the state’s underfunded retirement system since 1996.<br />In a recorded budget address released Tuesday, Mr. Murphy said the state needs to begin planning for its future beyond the pandemic.<br />“It is the time for us to also lean into the economic policies that will not just get us through the remaining months of the pandemic, but which will supercharge our re-emergence from it and the recovery that awaits on the other side,” said Mr. Murphy, who is up for reelection this year.<br />The Murphy administration will now begin budget talks with leaders in the Democratic-controlled state Legislature. State Sen. Paul Sarlo, the Democratic chairman of the Senate budget and appropriations committee, said Mr. Murphy’s budget plan was a “reasonable proposal that makes use of anticipated resources to address the expected needs of the people of New Jersey.”</td>

      <td>Soleil Moon Frye reprises her role in a reboot of the boundary-breaking sitcom.</td>
      <td>‘Punky Brewster,” the “Punky-Powered” sitcom of the mid-’80s starring the bubbly Soleil Moon Frye, had a relatively brief life on NBC, another in syndication and was the inspiration for a Saturday morning cartoon. The very phrase “Saturday morning cartoon” summons up the kind of nostalgia that Peacock’s rebooted “Punky Brewster” is intended to kindle. Rather than the fragrant recycling effort it actually suggests.<br />This is not the fault of the cast. Ms. Moon Frye—who was 8 years old when she made her debut as Punky—has maintained enough of a presence on various TV series that fans won’t be too shocked that she’s now playing a 40-ish divorced mom of three, living in the spacious Chicago apartment left to her by her adoptive father, Henry (who was played in the original show by George Gaynes; the late actor’s photo occupies a place of honor in the new, Punkified living room). She is a charming presence, and so are the young actors playing her kids—the teenage Hannah (Lauren Lindsey Donzis), the younger Diego (Noah Cottrell) and the even younger and evidently gender-curious Daniel (Oliver De Los Santos). Daniel and Diego are adopted; Hannah seems to be the biological child of Punky and her ex, Travis (Freddie Prinze Jr.), who, like Seinfeld’s neighbor Kramer, is given to barging in unannounced and often at inopportune times. Given that Punky’s resuscitated sex life is to be a recurring part of the storyline, this open-door policy could well lead to situations of the lowly comic and cringe-inducing variety. Likewise, the fact that Hannah and Punky are both dating, and even run into each other one night with their beaus in tow.<br />The overall tone of “Punky Brewster” redux feels like it’s been hidden under someone’s mullet since 1984. What distinguished the show from the competition then and now is the adoption angle, which is a significant one: The original “Punky Brewster” was a landmark of sorts, in that Punky had been abandoned by her mother at a shopping mall and became the first regularly scheduled prime-time network foster child (Henry adopted her in season 2). The new show’s prepubescent wild card, its element of conflict, its chief purveyor of precocious wisecrackery, is Izzy (Quinn Copeland), who has also been abandoned by her mother, and thus worms her way into Punky’s heart and home. Izzy has been the biggest escape artist at Fenster Hall—the same facility from which Henry had to extract Punky after she entered the system back in 1984—and has been under the jurisdiction of social worker Cherie (Cherie Johnson, of the original series), who apparently greases the bureaucratic wheels so Punky can immediately foster Izzy.<br />Unlike the old show, this “Punky Brewster” doesn’t make much out of the hard facts of foster care—it doesn’t make much of a deal at all about the fact that Punky’s mother calls her on the phone at the end of episode 1, after 36 silent years. (Mom goes all but unmentioned for several subsequent episodes.) Punky tells her indignant threesome that they don’t just need to make space for Izzy in their apartment, “you need to make space for her in your hearts.” Everyone groans, including the kids. But in both versions of the show, the catalyst is the relatively rare occurrence of outright child abandonment that situates their characters. The intentions are good—mainstreaming adoption and foster care in pop culture. But the real-life foster-care system is much more concerned with children separated from their parents over alleged negligence or abuse, which is often the result of poverty. It would be interesting to see a show tackle foster care from that angle. This is not that show.<br />It is, instead, a gently comic program in which every episode has a moral and which mines its own past in various ways—Punky’s unbridled color sense and her mismatched sneakers, for instance. But if viewers are looking for a blithe skip down Memory Lane, “Punky Brewster” trips on the untied laces of its pink and orange Converse. The incessant laugh track, for one thing, is a throwback to the general mediocrity of so many network comedies of the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, and is a means of strong-arming giggles out of its more vulnerable and sentimental viewers. It’s difficult to tell whether the dialogue by executive producers Steve and Jim Armogida (“School of Rock,” “Grounded for Life”) is as insipid as it seems or if that laugh track is just throwing things off balance and stifling the rhythm. Much of “Punky Brewster” would be funnier, and perhaps even endearing, if it weren’t trying quite so hard to be both.</td>

      <td>Move by Jair Bolsonaro to place army general atop oil giant seen as meddling in state firm</td>
      <td>SÃO PAULO—The financial future of Brazilian oil giant  Petrobras  hung in the balance Tuesday as its board met to decide whether to approve President Jair Bolsonaro’s controversial appointment of an army general to the company’s helm in an apparent bid to force the firm to subsidize fuel prices.<br />Mr. Bolsonaro’s nomination of Gen. Joaquim Silva e Luna, who served alongside him under Brazil’s 1964-85 dictatorship and has no experience in the oil industry, has roiled markets, wiping billions of dollars off Petrobras’s market value and raising fears about government meddling in the economy.<br />While the board meeting was scheduled to end late Tuesday, people close to the deliberations said the 11 members may delay the decision on whether to back the president’s move or defy him. A delay will only create more uncertainty, analysts said, prompting possible further losses at the company.<br />Petrobras’s shares on Tuesday climbed 8%, recovering some of the ground lost the day before, when they plunged roughly 20%, the second-biggest daily loss in market value since the early 1990s, according to Economatica, a São Paulo-based analysis firm. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stocks index rose 2% by Tuesday afternoon and the real strengthened slightly against the dollar.<br />The right-wing president’s intervention at Petrobras was widely seen among investors as a pivotal moment in his two-year-old administration, a sign that he was going to put politics above economics ahead of his 2022 re-election bid. Subsidizing fuel prices would likely cost the state firm billions of dollars a year, crippling its finances and diminishing its ability to find and produce more oil.</td>

A grandmother and three grandchildren died in a house fire as they were trying to stay warm, the Chronicle also reported.

Several others died from carbon-monoxide poisoning after taking unsafe measures to stay warm, according to the county’s top executive.

Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona are the only two Democrats to say outright they oppose increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, up from $7.25 currently. But 10 other Senate Democrats haven’t signed onto stand-alone legislation increasing the minimum wage to that level, and some have voiced objections to the current structure of the pay boost, setting the stage for possible revisions.<br />“Everyone is going to have things that they want to see in the bill, and we’ll work hard to see if we can get those things in the bill, but job number one is to pass the bill,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) told reporters Tuesday.<br />The legislation, which is backed by President Biden and expected to pass the House later this week, would provide $400-a-week unemployment benefits through Aug. 29, send $1,400 per-person payments to most households, provide billions in funding for schools and vaccine distribution, expand the child tax credit, broaden child-care assistance and bolster tax credits for health insurance.</td>

      <td>Your editorial “Texas Spins Into the Wind” (Feb. 18) misplaces the blame for the rolling blackouts in Texas on its “frozen turbines.” Here in Michigan, we have more than a thousand wind turbines that operate without failure in far more severe winter weather than Texas has ever seen. The difference is that our wind turbines are equipped with optional cold-weather packages; apparently the turbines in Texas are not. This is an extra-cost option that wind-turbine manufacturers offer, just as auto makers offer optional cold-weather packages for the cars they sell. Michigan gas pipelines and power plants are also winterized, and continue to operate in severe weather. It isn’t the fault of wind-turbine technology that some of the wind turbines in Texas froze; it was the result of a cost-cutting purchase decision that backfired.<br />This isn’t the first time. Ten years ago, in February 2011, Texas had unusually cold weather that led to power plant failures (both wind and gas) causing 3.2 million customers to lose power. Then, as now, more power was lost from frozen gas facilities than frozen wind turbines; only 6% of their electricity came from wind at that time. There was an investigation, of course. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reported a key finding: “The lack of any state, regional or reliability standards that directly require generators to perform winterization left winter-readiness dependent on plant or corporate choices.” Texas power producers could have equipped their wind turbines and gas systems for this weather.

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden’s largely smooth cabinet selection process hit a rough patch this week, as Neera Tanden’s nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget is in deepening peril and some Democrats are discussing potential candidates to replace her.<br />Two other nominees faced skeptical Republicans in confirmation hearings on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Senate confirmed Linda Thomas-Greenfield as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Tom Vilsackas agriculture secretary. Merrick Garland, Mr. Biden’s nominee for attorney general, is also expected to be confirmed with bipartisan support next month.<br />California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, Mr. Biden’s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, faced questions Tuesday from Republicans who said he is too liberal and lacks public-health experience. “I’ll say what I’ve said to him privately. I’m not sold yet,” said Sen. Richard Burr (R., N.C.), the ranking Republican on the committee.<br />Several Republicans on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee suggested they weren’t satisfied with responses from Rep. Deb Haaland (D., N.M.), Mr. Biden’s nominee for interior secretary, at a separate hearing and wanted to hear more from her.<br />Mr. Biden’s nominees can win confirmation in the Senate without Republican votes as long as all Democrats support them. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) is undecided on both Mr. Becerra and Ms. Haaland, his office said, and he threw Ms. Tanden’s nomination to lead OMB into doubt late last week when he said he would oppose confirming her.</td>

Unfortunately the Obama path rarely achieved the stated results. What comes to mind is the contradiction between President Biden’s pronounced priorities and the real-world impact of his early achievements, such as they are.<br />Shutting down the Keystone XL pipeline works against his overarching desire to move toward full employment. In addition, the alternatives to movement of oil by pipeline will exacerbate our carbon footprint and global-warming concerns. The minimum wage of $15 per hour guarantees a net reduction in entry-level jobs across the country and has dire consequences for very small businesses. Strong statements on foreign-affairs matters that have nothing behind them diminish U.S. influence, don’t inspire “global admiration for U.S. values” and are a disservice to our allies abroad. Close affiliation with Black Lives Matter doesn’t send a positive message to the overall U.S. population. The actual implications of President Biden’s policies as currently advanced don’t enhance peace and prosperity.

      <td>In Netflix’s six-part documentary, historian interviews and bloody re-enactments tell the story of the country’s civil war.</td>
      <td>The ostensible subjects of “Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan” are dubbed “the mounted knights of old Japan” and while a properly romantic description, it falls a bit short: The sword-wielding martial artists of the feudal era (1185-1868) have not only taken up residence in the Western imagination but created ornate, interlacing connections between pop cultures East and West. Akira Kurosawa, for instance, who was a student of John Ford, portrayed his heroes like the gunslingers of the Old West, or even Prohibition gangsters. Detective novelist Dashiell Hammett’s 1929 “Red Harvest” was the basis for Kurosawa’s “Yojimbo,” which in turn inspired Sergio Leone’s “A Fistful of Dollars,” which inspired the Bruce Willis movie “Last Man Standing.” Beneath all the intersecting fictional mayhem lay feudal roots. Most of us samurai-movie fans just don’t know where or what they are.<br />The experts in “Age of Samurai” certainly do. And they tell far more than the average viewer is going to be able to consume over the six parts of the documentary series, which is devoted to the history, traditions and politics not just of the samurai but of Japan itself. It is as much about the “Age” as of the “Samurai” and follows a familiar path familiar to Netflix documentary viewers: Historians and other academics and authors comment on the story being retold, while dramatic re-creations follow it—often, in this case, to harrowing effect. According to one of the interviewees, samurai, a word that originally meant “servant,” were “probably the greatest warriors the world has ever known.” This is precisely the kind of unprovable hype that might turn a viewer off, though the dramatic portions of the program strive to make it seem so: The descriptions, accounts and dramatic re-enactments of the “melee combat” conducted with the legendary katana (samurai swords) result in geysers of blood, rolling heads and certainly are meant to impress viewers with not just the degree but the intimacy of the violence that occurred between rival clans, which used the samurai as their infantry.<br />It’s a fascinating narrative retold and begins here in 1551 with the death of Oda Nobuhide, head of the powerful Oda clan at a time when the central government of Japan had collapsed and incited civil wars across the country among the various power- and land-hungry daimyo, or warlords. The principal character, beginning with episode 1, is Oda Nobunaga, the unpredictable, bloodthirsty and ultimately brilliant son of Nobuhide who would become the first “great unifier” of Japan, but not before modernizing military strategies and introducing firearms into what was previously an arena of hand-to-hand combat.<br />“Age of Samurai” has an international cast of academicians, some quite captivating, on hand to deliver a historically substantiated account of the samurai and their emerging nation. They include the historian-authors Stephen Turnbull, David Spafford, Tomoko Kitagawa and others, all of whom seem to agree on almost everything that happened, which seems odd: Aren’t historians supposed to disagree? One might expect more clashing of academic katanas, but they are as unified as Japan would be, more or less, when the feudal bloodletting was over.</td>

      <td>Men whose style skews casual are zeroing in on the coziest things around: outrageously soft fleece trousers</td>
      <td>IF YOU BELIEVE that shlumpy, elastic-waisted sweatpants sit at the extreme end of casual wear, well, you are wrong. Push further into the realm of comfort and you will find fuzzy fleece pants, perhaps the most notable achievement in wearable coziness. Cut like a roomy sweatpant (often with a similarly accommodating elastic waist) but fabricated in a highly insulating plush material, fleece pants are like a Patagonia Retro-X jacket transplanted onto your legs. Could it get any cozier than that?<br />Fleece pants are not a recent creation. Back in the 1990s, Gene Han, the owner of Hatchet Outdoor Supply Co., a clothing shop with locations in Brooklyn and Los Angeles, recalls seeing fleece pants from labels like ACG— Nike ’s  techy, hiking-inspired sub-label. This winter, though, he’s witnessed an unprecedented demand for his shop’s stock of the teddy-bear-plush pants from nature-focused labels Gramicci and Manastash. “We are totally sold out….I wanted some for myself while I’m stuck at home and I couldn’t even pick them up,” he said.<br />It’s not just that they’re stupendously soft. Mr. Han (whose shop also sells sweatpants) considers fleece pants toastier and therefore “superior” to sweats. Converts concur. Fleece pants are “like wearing a blanket for each of your legs,” said Kyle Bevilacqua, 36, a New Jersey-based corporate tax attorney who bought a pair of furry fleece trousers from New York’s 18 East about a year ago. Mr. Bevilacqua, who is a runner, initially got the pants because he wanted “something super warm to wear” to winter races.<br />As a source of insulation, the fleece pants exceeded his expectations and have since infiltrated his daily winter wardrobe. He wears them with waffle-knit sweaters and, for maximum coziness, a fleece sweatshirt. On super cold days, Mr. Bevilacqua said, “they became this really great thing to throw on to run out and grab a coffee or just take a walk around town.” The highly textural trousers also provoke envying comments: “I’ve gotten a few ‘those look so incredibly warm.’”<br />Kendall Riley, 29, a software consultant in Lawrence, Kan., snags compliments, too, when he wears one of his three pairs of Gramicci fleece pants, which are cut a bit like a straight-legged five-pocket jean. “I had someone say that ‘they’re really fun,’” he said. Recently, he posted a photo of himself in the fluffy bottoms on Instagram and a friend’s mother messaged him to ask where she could get them for her son. Mr. Riley tends to pair the fluffy pants with simple fare like a navy sweatshirt or a matching tan Patagonia fleece.</td>

      <td>Cruise line shares are trading up on reopening hopes alone</td>
      <td>If you are confused by the savage recovery of so-called “reopening” stocks, you are clearly overthinking things. Yes, sectors like hotels, amusement parks and casinos are soaring, even as revenues remain severely depressed. But markets’ new mantra seems to channel the age-old design principle: “Keep it simple, stupid.”<br />Look no further than cruise stocks. Shares of the three major cruise lines are up an average of 53% over the past six months, even though there has been little in the way of an actual restart in the industry. As  Royal Caribbean  Group’s chief executive officer, Richard Fain, said on his company’s fourth-quarter conference call Monday, most of its ships are still sitting idle after almost a year, and most of its global operations have been suspended at least through April. Meanwhile, Carnival Corp. apparently has decided that if it can’t sell cruise tickets, it will just sell stock instead. The company said on Monday it was raising $1 billion in common stock, also indicative of strong investor demand for the sidelined industry.<br />Hope floats, apparently. Estimates compiled by Visible Alpha show analysts expect Royal Caribbean’s revenue to remain down from 2019 levels by 74% this year and not exceed pre-pandemic levels until 2023. UBS analyst Robin Farley argues that while bookings look to be down for the second half of this year on an absolute basis compared with a normal year, booking volume is likely to be well above service capacity, given cruise lines’ plan for a phased re-entry of select ships at a time. She also noted cumulative advance bookings for the first half of next year are within historical ranges and seem to be at higher prices, a sign of pent-up consumer demand.<br />An analysis of booking trends done by cruise review site Cruise Critic is also encouraging. The site said it saw a 40% increase in cruise shoppers in January versus December, with the majority of bookings for trips this year rather than next year. But future cruising may be contingent upon certain protocol being put in place: 81% of Cruise Critic readers polled in January and February said they would cruise if there was a vaccination requirement to sail. While it is still unclear at this point what the regulations will be for future passengers to cruise, Royal Caribbean’s Mr. Fain did refer to vaccines as “the ultimate weapon” on Monday.<br />Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Woronka argued in a note this week that historically it has “proven unwise to fight a thesis trade”—in this case pent-up demand for vacations—no matter what consensus expectations may be. The risk, he notes ironically, is that analysts’ forecasts will catch up to or even exceed those of investors. This would set the stocks up for disappointment if actual earnings fall short of estimates once cruising resumes.</td>

Andrew Cuomo did something wrong in his handling of Covid-19 in the state’s nursing homes, according to a poll released Tuesday.<br />The poll by Marist College Institute for Public Opinion found the Democratic governor’s job-approval rating had slipped below 50%. Of the 953 adults surveyed Feb. 15 to 17, 49% said they approved and 44% said they disapproved of the job he is doing. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.<br />“Cuomo’s approval rating, which was sky high in the summer, has returned to its pre-pandemic level,” Marist Poll Director Lee M. Miringoff said. “Should Cuomo decide to seek a fourth term, these results suggest it will be a challenge. That said, his current numbers are comparable to what they were when he faced the voters last time.”<br />It is the third poll released amid weeks of rising criticism of the way Mr. Cuomo’s administration delayed a fuller accounting of the number of New Yorkers who died at long-term-care facilities. Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Mr. Cuomo, said the results varied between polls, and two other surveys showed the governor’s job approval above 50%.<br />“We remain focused on fighting this pandemic, administering as many vaccines as possible, and safely and smartly reopening our state,” Mr. Azzopardi said.</td>

      <td>The coronavirus pandemic has caused another kind of pervasive affliction, Harvard researchers say: loneliness.<br />More than one-third of 950 Americans reported feeling lonely at least “frequently” in the previous four weeks, according to a newly released survey by researchers at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, conducted in October. That’s higher than the quarter of respondents who recalled feeling serious loneliness in the two months before the pandemic, and 28% of respondents said they had experienced increases in the frequency of their loneliness. Young adults and mothers felt especially isolated, the survey reported.<br />Social disruption has hit people in myriad ways: A college student living back at home may feel disconnected from their normal social life, while an overworked parent may feel detached from their usual support system. And even people managing to cultivate an active Zoom-led social life may still feel disconnected.<br />But it is possible to take steps to reduce loneliness, says Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer in Harvard’s Graduate School of Education who directs the Making Caring Common project, which has studied community and interfamily relationships over the course of the pandemic.<br />Dr. Weissbourd spoke with the Journal about the rise in loneliness and what we can do about it.</td>

The fund employed so-called alternative strategies, including volatility and betting on and against stocks, according to disclosures.<br />Halting redemptions is an unusual move, since mutual funds offer freedom to cash out at any time, and it suggests severe problems at the firm. Third Avenue Management LLC halted redemptions in one of its credit funds in 2015, a move that shocked the market, left a black mark on the firm and spurred worries about the wider bond market.<br />Infinity Q said in a statement that the firm is “cooperating with the SEC investigation” and has cut off Mr. Velissaris’s access to trading.</td>

      <td>Senate Republicans are eager to get aid where it’s needed, reopen schools and encourage work.</td>
      <td>Democrats are anxious for any excuse to blow up the Senate filibuster, the last procedural hurdle to one-party government. Their latest is that Republicans oppose the president’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package. Despite having passed five bipartisan Covid-19 relief bills to date—including one barely seven weeks ago—they claim our opposition demonstrates historic intransigence.<br />No, it demonstrates that the $1.9 trillion bill is a clunker. It would waste hundreds of billions of dollars, do nothing meaningful to get kids back to school, and enact policies that work against job creation. The Congressional Budget Office’s recent analysis of the plan found that more than a third of the proposed funding—$700 billion—wouldn’t be spent until 2022 or later, undermining the administration’s claim that the massive price tag is justified for urgent pandemic-related needs.<br />The Biden stimulus is unsound economic policy. High unemployment isn’t the result of too little money in American pockets; it’s because of the pandemic. Sending out checks won’t get consumers back into restaurants, bars, salons, malls, hotels or airplanes. Near-record levels of savings are evidence that consumers are able to spend. When Covid is finally in the rearview mirror, they will come roaring back. Congress should target assistance to those who need it and help speed the delivery of vaccines—not borrow hundreds of billions more to check items off a political wish list, deepening the nation’s debt and risking inflation.<br />The bill is also filled with bad policies and sloppy math. It calls for $350 billion for states and localities. If you live in New York, you might think that sounds about right because the pandemic severely exacerbated your state’s existing financial woes. But New York is the exception. Florida hasn’t even had to dip into its rainy-day fund. California has a multibillion-dollar surplus. Utah’s revenues rose by double digits.<br />JP Morgan  found that 21 states had revenue increases in 2020. Other states drew on rainy-day funds—which is what they are there for. Only a few are in severe financial distress. The same is true of cities and counties: Some are hurting, but the great majority aren’t. Most local tax revenue comes from property taxes, which are far less volatile than sales or income taxes. Sending out hundreds of billions of dollars to states and localities regardless of need is both wasteful and harmful. It would create incentives for the mismanagement that got some states into fiscal trouble in the first place.</td>

      <td>Beijing is obsessed with viruses, but not biosafety. We are paying a high price for its lapses.</td>
      <td>The Chinese Communist Party is obsessed with viruses. Its army of scientists claim to have discovered almost 2,000 new viruses in a little over a decade. It took the past 200 years for the rest of the world to discover that many. More troubling is the party’s negligence on biosafety. The costs and the risk to world health are enormous, as evidenced by a novel coronavirus that escaped Wuhan. This situation can’t continue. The world must hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable and punish Beijing if it fails to uphold global biosafety standards, including basic transparency requirements.<br />The most recent example of this malfeasance is playing out around us. The evidence that the virus came from Wuhan is enormous, though largely circumstantial, and most signs point to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or WIV, as the source of Covid-19. In America, concern about the site is now broad and bipartisan. The Biden administration stated that it has “deep concerns” about the World Health Organization’s investigation into the early days of the pandemic, particularly Beijing’s interference with the investigators’ work.<br />The world has known for a long time that WIV poses a huge risk to global health. Two 2018 State Department cables warned of its biosafety problems. They even predicted that SARS-CoV-2’s ACE2 receptor, identified by WIV scientists, would enable human-to-human transmission. Yuan Zhiming, then director of WIV’s biosafety level 4 lab, warned, “The biosafety laboratory is a double-edge sword: It can be used for the benefit of humanity, but can also lead to a disaster.” He listed the shortfalls prevalent among China’s biology labs, including a lack of “operational technical support, professional instructions” and “feasible standards for the safety requirements of different protection zones and for the inoculation of microbiological animals and equipment.”<br />The Chinese public took note, with several bloggers alleging that WIV’s virus-carrying animals are sold as pets. They may even show up at local wet markets. After the Wuhan outbreak, one since-disappeared blogger asked a WIV researcher to debate the lab’s biosafety practices in public. The offer was ignored.<br />Beijing has a moral and legal obligation to take biosafety seriously, especially given the kind of research going on at WIV. In 2015, WIV’s Dr. Shi Zhengli co-wrote an article titled “A SARS-like Cluster of Circulating Bat Coronaviruses Shows Potential for Human Emergence” in which she admitted that her team had engineered “chimeric” and “hybrid” viruses from horseshoe bats. In a 2019 article titled “Bat Coronavirus in China,” Ms. Shi and her co-authors warned, “It is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China.” At the time, WIV housed tens of thousands of bat virus samples and experiment animals.</td>

      <td>Macy’s  belongs to an endangered species in the world of retail. That comes with one benefit: Every sign of life can be enough to keep investors on board.<br />Macy’s did have a better holiday season than expected. Net sales were down 18.7% in the quarter ended Jan. 30 compared with a year earlier, better than the 22.6% decline that analysts polled by Visible Alpha expected. But that was still a steeper revenue decline than the 14.4% drop that department stores around the country experienced over the same period, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.<br />The retailer also benefited from fewer product returns compared with previous holiday seasons—thanks in large part to customers buying less clothes. Home, beauty, jewelry and watch categories were popular this holiday season.<br />Net income was a positive surprise, coming in at $160 million compared with the $14.3 million analysts expected. That was mostly thanks to greatly reduced operating expenses. The department store chain reduced operating costs by $900 million for the full year and expects to keep expenses at that depressed level going forward. For the full year, Macy’s incurred a net loss of $3.9 billion.<br />It is important to remember that behind Macy’s cost reductions are expectations that it will sell less going forward. Macy’s thinks fiscal 2021 net sales will be 15.5% lower than fiscal 2019 levels at the high end of its guidance. That’s not a high bar: Sales also declined in 2019.</td>

      <td>Black News Channel has expanded its reach more than 20-fold in about seven months, part of its new chief executive’s ambitious plan to shake up the cable-TV news landscape and provide an alternative that looks through the lens of Black Americans.<br />Since he took over the channel last July, Chief Executive Princell Hair has struck distribution deals with  Comcast Corp.’s  Xfinity,  AT&T Inc.’s  DirecTV,  Dish Network Corp.  and others, boosting its potential audience to more than 52 million households from roughly 2.5 million.<br />Mr. Hair also led a revamp of the network’s lineup, signing high-profile commentators Charles Blow and Marc Lamont Hill, whose shows will provide coverage and analysis the network’s executives and newscasters believe Black Americans aren’t getting anywhere else.<br />“We’re standing on the forefront of a tremendous opportunity when you look at the stories of the past year: the pandemic, the George Floyd murder and the ensuing civil unrest, a very contentious presidential election, record unemployment, and all of these stories disproportionately impact Black and brown communities,” Mr. Hair said in an interview. “These are the stories that we have to get out.”<br />When Mr. Hair, a TV veteran whose resume includes stints at  CBS ,  CNN, Turner Broadcasting and NBC Sports, took the helm in July, he said he commissioned research and analysis to see what was needed to attract viewers. The research showed that Black Americans feel underserved with news coverage choices, and that the community is an untapped driver of economic growth.</td>

In two rounds of voting, the ruling party, Georgian Dream, cemented its hold on power. The party’s creator, metals and real-estate tycoon Bidzina Ivanishvili—who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s—is largely believed to influence the government from behind the scenes.</td>

Tesla Inc.  had fallen 2% after dropping as much as 12% in early trading, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1% after an early decline of 4% put it on track for its worst day since September. The index is down 6% from its peak Feb. 12, as rising U.S. interest rates prompt a broad re-evaluation of investor growth expectations, and on track for a sixth straight decline—its longest pullback in a year.<br />Tesla, whose 743% surge last year highlighted the tech-led market rebound from the coronavirus selloff, is now down for 2021 and has lost a quarter of its value since the electric-car maker said on Feb. 8 that it had spent $1.5 billion on bitcoin in an effort to boost returns on cash.<br />Other investor favorites were also recovering after being hit hard in early trading.  Moderna Inc.,  the maker of a major Covid-19 vaccine, was down 7% after falling as much as 13%.  Apple Inc.  dropped 2% and  Amazon.com Inc.  fell 1%.<br />The tech companies have emerged as favorites among small investors who have piled into stock and options trading over the past year, with the Nasdaq rising 44% in 2020. But the scale of the rally has prompted concerns that many of the stocks are overvalued, making them vulnerable to sudden slumps.</td>

      <td>Schools are getting billions they can spend over nearly a decade.</td>
      <td>Perhaps you’ve heard that the $1.9 trillion House spending bill is meant to provide “urgent” and “emergency” relief. But did you know that the Covid emergency in America’s schools will apparently last through 2028?<br />The House proposal showers K-12 schools with nearly $129 billion. That’s on top of the $13.2 billion allocated in last spring’s Cares Act and the $54.3 billion in December’s bipartisan splurge. According to the Congressional Budget Office, schools have spent only a fraction of that previous $67.5 billion. It’s hard to spend money when schools aren’t open for classroom instruction since unions have resisted returning to work in much of the country.<br />Because of this leftover cash, CBO estimates that a mere $6.4 billion of the new aid package will be spent for K-12 schools in the 2021 fiscal year. That’s right—only $6 billion of $129 billion will be spent during the pandemic emergency.<br />CBO estimates that $32.1 billion will be spent in fiscal 2022 on K-12 schools, $32.1 billion in 2023, $25.7 billion in 2024, $19.3 billion in 2025, $9 billion in 2026, $2.6 billion in 2027, and $1.3 billion in 2028.<br />In other words, this isn’t about Covid relief. School districts can spend the funds on a wide range of options—from sanitizing classrooms to “continuing to employ existing staff of the local educational agency”—and the money is fungible. This means that, after the pandemic eases perhaps as soon as this year, school districts are likely to use the money to pad their bureaucracies and teacher payrolls. One of the bill’s few limitations is that local educational agencies must spend 20% of their funds to address “learning loss” with interventions such as summer school or extended-day programs. This would require more money for teacher pay or additional hiring for union dues-paying positions.</td>

That was exponentially higher than the average price, which was $21.18 per megawatt hour in 2020, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or Ercot, the nonprofit that controls the grid.<br />Now power retailers and municipal utilities are trying to figure out how to pass on the billions of dollars in costs to customers, some of whom face bills in the thousands of dollars that may need to be stretched out over time.<br />In Denton, a North Texas university city that suffered outages and natural-gas supply shortages, city leaders are looking to borrow up to $300 million to cover fuel expenses from last week, which amounts to around $2,000 for each of the city’s 150,000 residents.</td>

Iran has rejected direct negotiations with the U.S., as long as American sanctions remain in place and the U.S. remains outside the 2015 deal. But European officials have warned Iran in recent days that it risks deepening its isolation if it misses the opportunity for direct talks with Biden administration officials, who would attend as guests in the informal meeting.<br />“These diplomatic contacts have to be discreet but I am reasonably optimistic” that Iran will join talks, the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said Monday.<br />Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei said Tuesday that Iran was “looking into the European side’s proposal of an informal meeting for a dialogue.”<br />Meanwhile, citing the U.S. refusal to lift sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, Iran on Tuesday followed through on a previous threat, saying it would no longer grant United Nations inspectors daily access to its nuclear facilities, or provide round-the-clock security footage of its activities at these sites. Iran will also bar the U.N. atomic agency from inspecting other sites where it suspects nuclear-related work might be taking place.</td>

      <td>Democrats’ $1.9 trillion relief package includes stimulus payments, jobless benefits, vaccine funding and more</td>
      <td>Democrats in Congress are racing to meet a mid-March deadline for President Biden’s coronavirus relief package before existing benefits like enhanced unemployment insurance expire. Here’s an overview of the $1.9 trillion legislation, which they are looking to pass with only Democratic votes. The package includes some elements, such as a $15 minimum wage, that might not survive intraparty negotiations or Senate rules.<br />The House and Senate passed a budget resolution earlier this month that allows them to craft a $1.9 trillion relief package. The size of the package has stayed the same since it was unveiled by President-elect Biden during the transition period, and after he rebuffed a proposal by a group of 10 Republicans who argued for a $618 billion bill.<br />The Biden administration says the package is the right size and that the economy needs relief on that scale in order to bring down real unemployment rates that the Federal Reserve estimates to be around 10%—accounting for misclassifications in government data and people who have exited the labor force—and to alleviate the economic hardship faced by millions whose lives and jobs have been disrupted.<br />“We think it’s very important to have a big package that addresses the pain this has caused,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently.<br />But Republicans have pointed to falling infection rates and unspent funds from previous relief packages as a reason to wait on any further stimulus. Meanwhile, many private economists have raised their growth outlooks for the year.</td>

      <td>Cryptocurrency prices fall sharply as enthusiasm for risky assets pauses</td>
      <td>This year’s furious rally in cryptocurrencies lost steam Tuesday, knocking prices for bitcoin and ether from recent highs, alongside drops in other risky assets including tech stocks.<br />Bitcoin fell 11% to $47,145 after hitting a record of $58,332 Sunday, according to CoinDesk. The decline lowered its market cap—the value of all bitcoin in circulation—to $878 billion, down from more than $1 trillion last week. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by total market value, fell almost 13% to $1,523.<br />A broad turn in markets toward caution, coupled with historically high prices, likely triggered the correction, analysts and investors said.<br />“The types of moves we were seeing in 2021 were parabolic,” said Joel Kruger, a strategist at cryptocurrency exchange LMAX Digital. “When you see moves like that, it’s obvious these markets are going to be due for a pullback.”<br />Assets—crypto or otherwise—that gained the most during the pandemic have slipped in recent days as investors bet on economies opening up. U.S. government bond yields have risen to their highest level in a year. When yields on safe bonds rise, that makes speculative assets, such as cryptocurrencies and shares in companies with profits far in the future, less attractive.</td>

      <td>A much-anticipated strategic update continues the bank’s frustratingly slow pivot toward Asia, only with lower shareholder returns</td>
      <td>Another year, another familiar-sounding strategic update at  HSBC .  The behemoth’s need to reiterate its pivot to Asia underlines what a slow, awkward process it is.<br />The London-headquartered, China-focused bank announced full-year results on Tuesday. As at peers, revenues were hit by lower interest rates globally and chunky allowances for pandemic-related loan losses. Unlike at investment-banking rivals, the bump in trading revenues from HSBC’s own trimmed-back business was a meager offset. A much-anticipated new strategy amounted to more of the same—except for lowered shareholders returns.<br />The shares fell in early trading, extending a year of underperformance. For much of the past decade the stock has traded at a premium to most European peers because of HSBC’s strong business in Hong Kong and mainland China, both profitable, fast-growing markets. But that gap has narrowed considerably in the past year, likely for two main reasons: Investors want faster organizational change, and they are concerned that HSBC’s trademark business model of bridging East and West is getting more difficult.<br />The bank broadly delivered on its 2020 targets. However, return on tangible equity or ROTE fell to just 3.1% from 8.4% a year earlier, and dividends were suspended at the British regulator’s request. The pandemic seems a valid excuse. The real disappointment was in its guidance for future returns. Target ROTE has been reduced and delayed, even with an additional $1 billion in cost cuts. Dividend expectations were pared back too: The growing quarterly payment has been replaced with a 40% to 55% payout ratio, possibly topped up with buybacks or special dividends.<br />Strategically, the bank is still focused on shifting more assets from Europe and the U.S. into Asia, as well as increasing its wealth management business and making its operations more digital. The direction of travel makes sense, but the pace remains frustratingly sedate, particularly as competition in the region is picking up. Discussions continue about long-mooted exits from retail operations in France and the U.S.</td>

Additionally, Tether agreed to publicly release quarterly statements detailing its reserves.<br />The attorney general’s office said the companies made several public misrepresentations, regarding the dollar reserves backing for tether in 2017 and a situation in 2018 when Bitfinex lost access to about $850 million of its customers’ funds that it had placed with an outside company.<br />When Bitfinex lost those customer funds, it borrowed money from the tether reserves to cover the loss, something it didn’t disclose publicly. That money has since been paid back, though Bitfinex is still trying to recover the original $850 million.<br />The settlement ends a long-running saga that had been keenly followed in the crypto industry. Both Bitfinex and tether are key cogs in the trading markets. If the attorney general’s office had charged them criminally, it could have had ramifications for the market as a whole.</td>

      <td>Concerns over Chinese geopolitical aggression prompt smaller European countries to block Chinese companies from public bids</td>
      <td>BRUSSELS—Some European countries are starting to block Chinese involvement in their economies, drawing closer to positions advocated by the U.S. amid growing anxiety in Europe over China’s increasingly aggressive geopolitical posture.<br />Governments from the Baltic to the Adriatic seas have recently canceled public tenders that Chinese state-owned companies were set to win, or are moving to ban Chinese companies from investing or contracting in their countries.<br />The shifts have been prompted by a mix of national-security concerns and disappointment with the performance of Chinese contractors, say officials involved in the decisions. Several of the canceled projects fell within China’s world-wide infrastructure initiative, Belt and Road, which has disappointed several participating countries.<br />The shift is largely taking place in smaller European countries, adding to tensions within the European Union, where big countries still largely favor maintaining business links with China.<br />Romania and Lithuania are taking broad measures to exclude Chinese companies from certain public procurements. Other moves are more targeted. Authorities in Slovenia, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Romania have suspended public tenders involving Chinese companies for work on nuclear-power plants, highways, rail lines, security scanners and a shipping-container terminal. Greece is debating whether to allow a Chinese shipping company to increase its majority stake in the country’s largest port.</td>

      <td>The bank said it struck a deal with Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonsini to take over the stock plans it manages for thousands of clients</td>
      <td>Morgan Stanley  is betting a partnership in Silicon Valley will lead to new long-term clients for its wealth-management business.<br />The bank said Tuesday that it struck a deal with Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati to take over the stock plans the law firm manages for thousands of clients. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Startups often offer stock as part of an employee’s pay. Wilson Sonsini created its own stock-plan software decades ago to help clients track the value of their employees’ holdings as companies matured from early-stage startups and raised outside money to finance their growth.<br />Morgan Stanley is pushing into stock-plan administration as an early entree into the financial lives of a new generation of customers. Some of those clients, the bank hopes, will turn to it for more lucrative services, such as advice, as their needs grow more complex. The digitization of finance has unleashed low- or no-cost services, such as commission-free trades and zero-fee investment funds, that money managers are deploying to attract new clients.<br />The Wilson Sonsini agreement aims to give Morgan Stanley a leg up in cementing connections with startups and their employees before a possible public offering. Some will become millionaires overnight; Google Inc., LinkedIn,  Twitter Inc.  and  Lyft Inc.  are among the companies the law firm helped take public.<br />Morgan Stanley paid $900 million to acquire Solium Capital Inc. in 2019, adding a platform that specialized in privately held firms and last year bought E*Trade Financial Corp., which manages stock plans for hundreds of companies, for $13 billion.</td>
