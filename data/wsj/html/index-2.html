      <td>The move by Trump allies, including Ted Cruz and James Lankford, isn’t expected to succeed in overturning President-elect Joe Biden’s win</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Eleven current and incoming Republican senators said they would vote to reject the Electoral College votes of some states on Wednesday as not “lawfully certified” unless Congress appoints a commission to conduct an emergency, 10-day audit of the election results.<br />Although none of the challenges are expected to succeed, they could slow down the process and give President Trump’s allies a high-profile chance to demonstrate their loyalty to him. The move also highlights deepening divisions within the Republican Party over whether to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election as legitimate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and other Senate GOP leaders have congratulated Democrat President-elect Joe Biden and have urged their colleagues not to join in efforts to dispute the outcome.<br />The GOP senators who signed onto the effort are Ted Cruz of Texas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Mike Braun of Indiana. It was also joined by Senators-elect Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.<br />By law, Congress must hold a joint session on Jan. 6 to ratify Mr. Biden’s 306-232 Electoral College win. Objections from some Republican senators and House members are expected to force debate and votes in both chambers of Congress. Majorities in both the House and Senate would have to agree for the challenge to be successful, an extremely unlikely prospect given that Democrats control the House.<br />In a statement released Saturday, the senators and senators-elect said the commission was needed because the 2020 presidential election was rife with “unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities.”</td>

Analysts surveyed by FactSet on average expected 493,000 Tesla deliveries in 2020. Tesla said it produced 509,737 vehicles last year.<br />The company’s resilience during the pandemic that has reduced road travel and damped auto sales globally has fueled investor exuberance for the electric-car maker. Its stock soared more than 700% last year.<br />Chief Executive Elon Musk, via Twitter, hailed the figures as a “major milestone,” adding that during the early days of Tesla he wasn’t certain the company would make it—a sentiment he has previously expressed.<br />Tesla in the coming months faces a difficult task as it looks to introduce additional vehicle models and open new factories in Germany and Texas as part of Mr. Musk’s growth ambitions.</td>

      <td>Hotel owners are bracing for a difficult 2021, as the sector continues to reel from a historic drop in bookings caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Even though the industry’s worst year in living memory ended with a glimmer of hope, many in the industry expect the celebrations to be short lived.<br />The start of Covid vaccinations in the U.S. and Europe raised the prospect that people would start traveling again and sent shares in hotel owners and operators soaring. But investors and analysts say bookings will take years to rise back to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, the industry faces growing financial stress as property owners struggle to pay their mortgage bills, wages and other expenses.<br />Despite the record drop in bookings, many hotels have been able to stay open thanks to debt relief from banks and temporary government aid like the Paycheck Protection Program. Now some lenders are starting to lose patience, brokers and investors say, which could lead to an increase in foreclosures and distressed-property sales in the first half of 2021.<br />For hotel owners, “it’s all about survival,” said Greig Taylor, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners LLP.</td>

      <td>History suggests that the president-elect should insist on strong decision-making processes and deal firmly with staff misbehavior</td>
      <td>As President-elect Joe Biden builds his administration, he has drawn on his long experience in national politics, filling key positions with White House veterans and a sprinkling of newcomers. But the success of Mr. Biden’s administration will depend not just on who gets big jobs but on the thoughtful management of his team. The new president needs a staff and cabinet that are cohesive in debate and unified in action.<br />Administration infighting is inevitable, but it needn’t be paralyzing. Mr. Biden’s goal should be to manage conflict, not to eliminate it. History points to three primary levers at his disposal: recognizing and managing ideological conflict, maintaining a strong decision-making process and dealing firmly with staff and cabinet misbehavior.<br />The most frequent White House divisions are along ideological lines. President Ronald Reagan’s administration was plagued by clashes between moderates, led by White House chief of staff James A. Baker, and committed conservatives, led by counselor Edwin Meese. Mr. Baker, in particular, was a master leaker and infighter. Still, when Reagan chose Mr. Baker over Mr. Meese as chief of staff, he directed Mr. Baker to “make it right with Ed.” The two joined with deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver to form the “troika” that ran the early Reagan White House.<br />The lack of trust among the troika members wound up leaving them joined at the hip, reluctant to let each other meet privately with Reagan for fear that the others might use facetime with the president to their advantage. This need to stick together applied even after Reagan was shot in 1981. When the troika visited his hospital bed together, Reagan joked, “I should’ve known I wasn’t going to avoid a staff meeting.” Yet getting the perspective of the two main competing ideologies within the GOP helped Reagan to hold on to both sides.<br />President Bill Clinton also used his ideologically divided staff to his advantage. His team initially pulled his administration leftward with an unsuccessful health care initiative, a tax hike and a push to end the Pentagon’s ban on gay people serving in the military. The liberal drift contributed to the Democrats’ loss of both houses of Congress in 1994. Smarting, Mr. Clinton brought in a secret adviser—whom he code-named “Charlie”—to help moderate his administration. This adviser’s tactics and mysterious identity unnerved liberal White House staffers like George Stephanopoulos and Harold Ickes, who found that progressive decisions made by day would shift to the right overnight.</td>

Many of these people said they would prefer remote work all five days of the workweek.<br />Another set of 10,000 employees surveyed by the Becker Friedman Institute for Economics at the University of Chicago say they felt the work-from-home situation was either just as productive or more so than the office. Some told the researchers that home was 30% more productive.</td>

      <td>Urban guys are wearing technical outdoor gear from brands like Patagonia, And Wander and the North Face. They look like they could summit Everest—but they’re probably just running to Starbucks.</td>
      <td>GORPCORE, named for the trail-mix acronym that’s short for “good ol’ raisins and peanuts,” represents the convergence of outdoorsy gear and more quotidian men’s fashion. Think of the technical parkas and backpacks you’d wear while nibbling on nuts and dried fruit during a hike up a mountain. Now transfer that same gear to city streets, maybe paired with your prosaic sneakers.<br />The term “gorpcore”—coined by New York Magazine’s style site the Cut in 2017—has been bubbling up in men’s fashion for a few years. It emerged as an outdoor-specific offshoot of the 2010s’ normcore trend, which recontextualized humble, pragmatic clothes as lust-worthy fashion. The defining gorpian image might be a photo of taciturn singer Frank Ocean trekking to a Paris fashion show in 2019 wearing a fitted, clementine-orange jacket by 159-year-old Swiss mountaineering brand Mammut and a greenish beanie from 32-year-old North Vancouver outdoor brand Arc’teryx, with bluejeans and hiking boots. He looks as if he’s wandered off the Pacific Crest Trail and into the Tuileries.<br />That Mr. Ocean wore Arc’teryx and Mammut during fashion week and not, say, Prada is telling. Gorpcore is not about designer labels cynically co-opting the outdoor look, creating fragile mountaineering boots that look the part but would falter on the trail. It’s about a deep appreciation of genuine, all-weather brands stretching from Japan’s And Wander to California’s Patagonia.<br />Those two brands represent two distinct classes of gorpcore. And Wander, a Tokyo-based label founded in 2011, is one of several relatively new brands that sell high-design gear that could nevertheless withstand a toe-tingling winter squall. Think fleeces with reflective details and sturdy pocket-packed poly pants. Also in this category: fellow Japanese labels Snow Peak and F/CE, the Swedish cold-weather brand Houdini, and Gyakusou, a  Nike  offshoot focused on running garb.<br />The other class of gorpcore brands—including REI, Marmot and Patagonia—are long-established stalwarts traditionally valued for placing function over design. Freshly coveted by young gorpcore fanatics, this group includes seasoned global brands like Helly Hansen (Norway) and Goldwin (Japan), and cultier, trail-rooted labels such as Gramicci, Manastash and La Sportiva.</td>

This year has begun with a vaccine,” he said at a news briefing in New Delhi on Saturday.<br />The U.K. authorized the vaccine earlier this week, and India is one of the first countries to follow suit.<br />The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine could be a good fit for India and other developing countries thanks to its price, convenience and expected global reach. AstraZeneca has promised to make as many as three billion doses available in 2021—more than any other Covid-19 vaccine maker—and at a cheaper price.</td>

      <td>Enduring power of China’s state-owned enterprises looks like a potential Achilles’ heel</td>
      <td>Can China’s hybrid state-capitalist economy learn to worship—or at least genuflect a bit deeper—at the altar of efficiency? As relations with wealthier, technologically advanced countries deteriorate, that is probably the most crucial economic question of the 2020s.<br />There are signs of real progress, much of it ironically driven by foreign pressure and the fear of stagnation as links with more open economies erode. But the enduring power of Chinese state-owned companies and their pull over the financial sector still represent huge vulnerabilities.<br />One clear and underappreciated example of progress is in intellectual property. Rhetoric from Washington notwithstanding, a majority of U.S. companies actually say IP protection in China is getting better, albeit from a low base, according to an American Chamber of Commerce survey this summer. Since 2014, China has set up a system of specialized IP courts and litigation has exploded, with over 481,000 IP cases in 2019, up nearly 50% from 2018.<br />New bankruptcy courts are also helping dispatch struggling companies more quickly, which could help address China’s chronic problem with “zombie” companies and free up scarce resources. The average length of bankruptcy cases in China is high: around 1.6 years on average over the past decade, or 60% longer than in the U.S., according to a recent National Bureau of Economic Research working paper.<br />But cases handled by the special courts—now roughly half of total bankruptcies, up from a negligible percentage in 2011—proceed about 35% more quickly than those in regular civil courts. Bankruptcy cases have also skyrocketed in numerical terms, rising from less than 5,000 in 2015 to nearly 19,000 in 2018 according to the Supreme People’s Court of China.</td>

      <td>New York City officials plan to administer 1 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine by the end of January, as the city moves to increase vaccination efforts beyond health-care workers and first responders and into communities hit hard by the coronavirus.<br />Mayor Bill de Blasio said the goal was attainable, although challenging, and would include opening up 250 vaccination sites inside school gymnasiums, community health centers and at some facilities currently used to test for the virus.<br />The city would also need support from the federal and state governments, including additional authorization to vaccinate those who are in groups of different priority for receiving the shot, the mayor said.<br />“We need to go into overdrive now. We need every day to speed up and reach more people,” Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a news conference Thursday.<br />So far, the city has administered a fraction of the vaccines it has received since being granted authorization in mid-December, according to city data. As of Dec. 31, the city has administered 88,410 doses of the more than 430,000 it has received, according to city data. The priority has been among health-care workers, and most vaccine doses have been given at local hospitals and nursing homes, officials said.</td>

Russia, they say, is therefore unlikely to back off from such tactics, even while facing U.S. sanctions or countermeasures.<br />“For a country that already perceives itself as being in conflict with the West practically in every domain except open military clashes, there is no incentive to leave any field that can offer an advantage,” said Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at Chatham House think tank.<br />The scope of Russia’s cyber operations has grown in tandem with Moscow’s global ambitions: from cyberattacks on neighboring Estonia in 2007 to election interference in the U.S. and France a decade later, to SolarWinds, seen as one of the worst known hacks of federal computer systems.</td>

      <td><br />The eurozone has always had a fundamental weakness compared with the U.S. when dealing with financial and economic crises: While its 19 countries share a currency and interest-rate policy, they have no common tax-raising or spending power.<br />In 2020, the European Union took a big step toward correcting that deficiency by starting to issue bonds on behalf of all member countries, known as common bonds. Beginning in 2021, some common bonds will be repaid through taxes raised by the EU itself.<br />This fiscal role for the EU is meant to be a one-off, but policy made in the teeth of a crisis—in this case the coronavirus pandemic—often sticks. Many investors and analysts say that a central ability to make taxation and spending decisions at the EU level will become permanent going forward.<br />Europe’s leaders signed two support packages to help the 19 eurozone members and eight other countries that don’t use the euro cope with the Covid-19 crisis. Almost €40 billion, equivalent to almost $49 billion, of bonds were sold in 2020, and another €210 billion of bonds are expected to be sold in 2021, according to Pictet Wealth Management. Total funding from bond sales for the packages is expected to total €850 billion.</td>

      <td>Congress is set to hold a joint session Wednesday to ratify Democrat President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win in the November election, in a final step ahead of his Jan. 20 inauguration. Some Republicans plan to raise challenges to some of the states’ results, alleging election irregularities. Their objections could force debate and votes in both chambers of Congress.<br />None of the challenges are expected to succeed, but they could slow down the process, and they give Trump allies a high-profile chance to formally challenge the election results. Here are some questions and answers about how events will play out.<br />The law specifies that Congress is to convene at 1 p.m. Jan. 6 for a joint meeting to officially count and validate the 538 electoral votes that have been certified by the 50 states and District of Columbia.<br />Under the process, Vice President Mike Pence, acting in his constitutional role as the president of the Senate, opens up all the certificates reflecting the vote tallies sent by the states. He hands them to “tellers,” who are people appointed from the House and the Senate to read the ballots and verify the results. The tellers then read the states’ certificates in alphabetical order, starting with Alabama and ending with Wyoming, stating that the certificate from each state “seems to be regular in form and authentic.” Mr. Pence has the power to recognize any lawmaker who objects.<br />Any lawmaker can challenge a state’s Electoral College votes, but it takes one member of the House and one senator to formally object to a state’s result and bring the challenge to a vote by lawmakers. The objection must be in writing.</td>

      <td>In the first exhibit to focus on the artist’s portraits on paper, over 100 works capture the progression of time in the visages of the painter and four other frequent subjects.</td>
      <td>New York<br />For anyone seeking refuge from pandemics and politics, nothing could be more healthful than “David Hockney: Drawing From Life” at the Morgan Library & Museum (through May 30). A show intimate and expansive, it makes the polished parquet floors and high ceilings of the galleries glow with warmth and love. Originating at Britain’s National Portrait Gallery, it is also the first exhibit to focus on Mr. Hockney’s portraits on paper.<br />Mr. Hockney is one of the few modern artists (along with Calder and Matisse) guaranteed to convey unabated pleasure. Matisse famously said he wanted to make “an art of balance, of purity and serenity…a soothing, calming influence on the mind, something like a good armchair which provides relaxation from physical fatigue.” Calder’s mobiles, his playful circus of light-as-air objects in three dimensions, bring smiles to adults and children alike.<br />For his part, Mr. Hockney fills his pictures with clarity imbued with charity that anyone can understand. Born in 1937, he is also, perhaps, the last in a line of Old Masters who have profited from academic training. That he honors tradition and simultaneously reinvents it (and himself) testifies to his energetic abundance.<br />Like Rembrandt and Picasso, both of whom are kindly overseeing presences here (as is Ingres, superb draftsman, master of the line), Mr. Hockney has been constantly self-revising and experimental. From pencil, pen and ink, charcoal, crayon, watercolor and gouache, through etching, lithography, photography and collage, to pictures on iPhone and iPad, there is practically no medium uncongenial to his talent.</td>

      <td>With many parents working from home and home schooling their children, an hourlong escape to the gym, even a home gym, is a luxury. If you’re finding it hard to make time for your workout, try including your kids.<br />“It’s important for your kids, no matter their age, to see you make movement a priority,” says Samantha Campbell, owner of Deep Relief Peak Performance Athletic Training Center in Haiku, Hawaii, on the island of Maui. “It could be as simple as a family walk before or after dinner.”<br />Ms. Campbell says she found it easier to carve out time for workouts when her daughter, Kiana Turpin, was younger. “I could place her in one spot while I worked out or hold her and do lunges or squats,” she says. “Now that she is 2 ½ years old, she can walk and talk and has her own ideas of what she wants to do.”<br />Rather than ditch her workout, Ms. Campbell creates ways to involve her daughter, and husband, Neil Turpin, which might be as simple as having her daughter call out the color of the cup Ms. Campbell and Mr. Turpin will perform a toe tap on.<br />With older children, Ms. Campbell suggests turning exercise into play. She often gamifies workouts for her training programs specifically designed for kids ages 5 to 13. “The more competitive you make an activity, the more excited kids are to do it,” she says. And both adults and kids tend to stick with workouts that feel fun. Here, Ms. Campbell shares six ideas for exercises that will challenge your core strength, reaction time, agility and cardio while getting the whole family involved.</td>

Mr. Gibbs, a 31-year Yum veteran who became chief executive officer a year ago, went from advancing the company’s expansion strategy to contending with thousands of closed restaurants.<br />Many large fast-food companies have since largely rebounded from the early pandemic shutdowns, and Yum’s U.S. comparable sales rose in the third quarter from a year ago. But Mr. Gibbs says he is rethinking how Yum—which has upward of 50,000 restaurants, more than any other fast-food chain—can serve and deliver more to-go food longer term.<br />He is plotting a future where ordering fried chicken ahead online is routine, and Pizza Hut customers can get their orders placed in their trunks without having to enter a restaurant.<br />Meanwhile, hundreds of its U.S. Pizza Hut locations that mostly did dine-in business have closed permanently.</td>

All that was left was for No. 2 Clemson to reach the final as well, setting up another rematch of teams that have already squared off in three of the last five title games.<br />But in an appropriate twist for this chaotic pandemic season, the Crimson Tide’s opponent will be No. 3 Ohio State. The Buckeyes delivered a stunning 49-28 knockout over the Tigers on the back of a big night by Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields, who threw six touchdown passes and bested Clemson superstar Trevor Lawrence, the presumed No. 1 pick in the next NFL draft.<br />Ohio State, a seven-point underdog in the Sugar Bowl, was playing without several starters due to coronavirus contact tracing. Yet the Buckeyes picked apart Clemson’s vaunted defense, avenging Ohio State’s bitter semifinal loss to Clemson a year ago in a game marked by controversial calls.<br />“It didn’t sit well in our mouth when we lost that game,” said Ohio State Coach Ryan Day of the 2019 Fiest Bowl. “So to come out and win the way we did [tonight], it was big.”<br />Alabama earlier earned its fifth trip to the national championship in six years by steamrolling No. 4 Notre Dame 31-14 in the Rose Bowl, which this year was relocated to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, from its namesake home in Pasadena, Calif., due to rising Covid-19 infection rates in Southern California.</td>

Louie Gohmert and several Arizona Republicans who unsuccessfully ran to be presidential electors—didn’t have standing to file the case.<br />The New Year’s Day order was the latest of dozens of state and federal court decisions rejecting efforts by President Trump and his allies to overturn the Nov. 3 presidential election, which Mr. Biden won with 306 electoral votes over Mr. Trump’s 232. Mr. Biden also defeated Mr. Trump in the nationwide popular vote, 81 million to 74 million.<br />Congress is to meet on Jan. 6 in a ceremonial session where electoral votes will be counted and the presidential election formally concluded.<br />Mr. Gohmert, who is from Texas, and the Arizona Republicans sued Mr. Pence in an effort to strike down the Electoral Count Act, an 1887 law that prescribes congressional procedures for finalizing presidential elections. Rather than perform the ceremonial role of opening electoral certificates from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as the law directs, the vice president, as president of the Senate, held the sole power to decide which votes to count, the lawsuit argued.</td>

      <td>No longer a drab exercise in dieting or self-denial, salads have become a sharp, spicy reflection of the best in culinary trends</td>
      <td>As 2021 begins, the dish I find myself craving the most, slightly to my surprise, is salad. The version I’ve been making most often lately is a concoction of raw Brussels sprouts, shredded finely and mixed with a Vietnamese-inspired dressing of garlic, mint leaves, chillies, fish sauce, rice vinegar, lime juice and cashew nuts. I don’t eat this salad because it is healthy—though it undoubtedly is—but because it wakes up my taste buds quicker than a double espresso. With its brightness and crunch, it tastes as close as I can get to a fresh start.<br />The rules of salad have changed. To be a salad eater is no longer an act of dieting or denial. Now you can eat salad because you want to eat it. The word no longer needs to bring to mind a flavorless bowl of cold tomatoes and watery lettuce. Rather, it could be any combination of crisp and sharp ingredients that you happen to find in your refrigerator and feel like having with dinner. A carefully made salad, as food writer Nigella Lawson writes in her new cookbook “Cook, Eat, Repeat,” will lift the spirits and “add poetry to the prose of everyday life.”<br />Growing up in Britain, as Ms. Lawson also did, I often looked to the U.S. for salads that were fuller and more generous than ours, which might consist of a couple of disks of undressed cucumber with some raw onion and vinegary beetroot. I dreamed of America’s Caesar and Cobb salads, with their flavorful dressings and lavish scatterings of croutons.<br />There have been many ages of salad at the American table. Perhaps no other dish has undergone so many transformations over the decades. Salads hold up a mirror to the changing culinary obsessions of the times, from the curious gelatin-based concoctions of the 1940s to the baked goat cheese and frisée salads of the 1980s to the raw kale of the 2010s. When salade Niçoise became fashionable in the 1960s, it reflected the new popularity of foreign travel to Europe. This mixture of tuna and black olives and green beans seemed deeply sophisticated compared with the old deli staple of tuna salad made with mayonnaise and chopped celery.<br />It can be hard to remember how the vast choice of salad stuff now compares with a few decades ago. Take radicchio. These bitter purple-and-white leaves were almost unheard of among American cooks until the mid-1970s, when in the space of six months it seemed that every expensive restaurant in New York added radicchio to its menu, starting with Le Cirque.</td>

      <td>From computers and money to relations with China, 1971 changed the world in many ways.</td>
      <td>Fifty years ago, America entered a magical year. Any year could hold moments of great significance, but 1971 stands out. After a decade of upheaval, the country was seeking a new start. These events launched it.<br />• Henry Kissinger’s secret trip to China. In the late 1960s, President Nixon and Mr. Kissinger began thinking that establishing diplomatic relations with China would serve as counterweight to tensions with Moscow. Nixon made some encouraging but vague statements, and Mr. Kissinger tried communicating through French and Pakistani emissaries with little progress.<br />Many believed the sticking point was U.S. recognition of Taiwan and the “two Chinas” policy. But declassified documents released by the National Archives in 2001 revealed that China was eager for dialogue. As historian William Burr observed, while many have written about America’s intention to play the China card, “it is the rare policymaker who understands that the United States may also be the object of other nations’ card playing.”<br />Mr. Kissinger’s secret July trip to Beijing triggered the greatest shift in global politics since the end of World War II. It paved the way for Nixon to meet Mao Zedong the following year and kicked off 50 years of diplomacy, trade and travel between China and the U.S. Recent tensions only confirm the complex motivations that launched the relationship. The card playing continues.<br />• The arrival of phone competition. With little fanfare, the Federal Communications Commission issued an opaque decision that marked the first blow to  AT&T ’s  monopoly in long-distance and business telephone service. The beneficiary was MCI, a tiny company that was about to change the communications world by introducing competition. Following the FCC decision, the company’s visionary leader William McGowan raised $110 million—then one of the largest startup funding rounds—to construct a new national telephone network that would end extravagant prices for long-distance calls. He fought through nearly a decade of litigation until the landmark 1980 ruling that broke up AT&T and gave MCI access to switched network connections required for competition.</td>

      <td>Anthony Fauci is being clobbered after admitting to the  New York Times  that he publicly lowballed his estimate of the Covid-19 herd immunity threshold, but it’s ludicrously late in the day to discover that “messaging” has been going on.<br />Dr. Fauci’s early pooh-poohing of masks to preserve supply for medical personnel at least was defensible for the larger good. Not until summer did he admit the test-and-trace miracle cure was no such thing given the realities of asymptomatic spread. To this day, test-and-trace serves as the magic X in every pundit piece, allowing the author to claim that our failing mommy and daddy (a k a government) let us down by not enacting this simple solution.<br />Of course it’s gibberish: 40% of Covid cases are asymptomatic; 80% of symptomatic cases are mild and indistinguishable from cold or flu so the sufferer has little reason to seek testing. Our borders are porous. So far we have tested only about 80% of Americans even once. We’d have to test 330 million every few days to catch a useful percentage of Covid cases while they’re still infectious. Add contact tracing and the numbers are clearly impossible. But because the strategy was useful in a South Korean context our politicians go through the motions here.<br />Another messaging snafu poked through last summer. CDC’s Robert Redfield admitted our testing might be catching only 10% of cases—i.e., the circus that fills hours of media airtime is doing nothing to control the epidemic or even measure it.<br />Official lying about things large and small has been a staple of Covid politics: the letters to college students threatening them with arrest if they don’t quarantine, the interstate travel “bans” that were never enforced, the death counts that swept up anybody who died of any cause while infected with Covid.</td>

      <td>Hartford, Conn.<br />The Hartford Courant has had a presence in Connecticut’s capital city for 250 years. Last month the paper’s owners announced that its newsroom would close for good. The Courant will continue to publish, but its reporters and editors will no longer work the phones in its downtown offices. Some journalists may consider the shift to remote work a relief. Hartford is the state’s most dangerous city and, by some measures, among the most dangerous cities in the country.<br />Once famous as the “insurance capital of the world,” Hartford has been in decline for 30 years. In the 1990s, Hartford’s population hemorrhage made national news. Today it is smaller still, less than 70% of what it was in 1950. Hartford’s poverty rate is one of the highest in the nation. The city is falling apart.<br />Even before the pandemic, WalletHub.com ranked Hartford 46th among state capitals in affordability, economic well-being, education, health and quality of life. The past nine months are unlikely to have improved that ranking. The city spends more than $400 million annually on education ($17,260 per student) yet nearly 30% of its students don’t graduate high school on time. Only 18% of students in grades 3 through 8 test at age-appropriate levels in math, and 25% do so in reading.<br />Hartford has been governed almost exclusively by Democrats since 1948. The city’s sole Republican mayor during that time, Antonina Uccello, left office in 1971. Earlier this year Mayor Luke Bronin, 41, embraced the progressive mantra to “defund the police” and reduced the city’s public-safety budget by $2 million, or 6%. The spike in gun violence that followed required Mr. Bronin to ask Gov. Ned Lamont, also a Democrat, to send in the Connecticut State Police. There were more than 200 shootings in the city through the first 11 months of the year—making it Hartford’s most violent year in at least a decade. What does Mr. Bronin think is responsible? A Connecticut Public Radio report put it bluntly: “The mayor blames the explosion of gun violence in his city on COVID-19.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Senate voted to override President Trump’s veto of a $740.5 billion defense bill, with many Republicans joining Democrats to deliver a rebuke to Mr. Trump in the final days of his presidency and for the first time pass into law legislation he had blocked.<br />The National Defense Authorization Act is an annual measure that secures hazard-pay raises for troops and authorizes funds for aircraft, ships, nuclear weapons, and other national-security programs. Mr. Trump had threatened to veto this year’s bill before it passed Congress, but lawmakers had moved forward anyway, approving it with wide majorities.<br />Mr. Trump has objected to several provisions in this year’s NDAA. He has criticized it for including measures that would strip military bases of names honoring Confederate military leaders and regulate troop withdrawals he has sought in Afghanistan and Germany. The White House also sought to repeal legal immunity social-media companies enjoy for users’ content as part of the bill, a push that lawmakers rebuffed.<br />The Senate voted 81-13 to override the veto, exceeding the two-thirds supermajority required. The action follows the House’s 322-87 override on Monday, and the bill now becomes law.<br />“Our Republican Senate just missed the opportunity to get rid of Section 230, which gives unlimited power to Big Tech companies. Pathetic!!!” Mr. Trump tweeted Friday. The legal immunities for social-media companies are enshrined in section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.</td>

      <td>BAURU, Brazil—In its 124-year history, this midsize, mostly white city in Brazil’s prosperous farming belt had never had an Afro-Brazilian as mayor. Until now.<br />The inauguration Friday of Suéllen Rosim, 32 years old, comes as thousands of Black and mixed-race politicians from across the political spectrum take office in municipal governments across Brazil in what is being hailed as a victory for people of color and a big step against racism in Latin America’s biggest country.<br />A growing appreciation of Brazil’s African heritage and the rising profile of influential Black politicians have fueled the shift. Brazil has the biggest Black or mixed-race population of any country outside Africa, nearly 120 million—more than half the population—but only 4% of politicians in Congress are Black.<br />A Supreme Court ruling in October that forced parties to allocate a percentage of their state-provided campaign funds to Black and mixed-race candidates also elevated politicians of color and encouraged more to identify as such.<br />“We’re showing that it’s possible—it’s possible to be a woman, to be Black, and to be a mayor, a state governor or even president,” said Ms. Rosim, a gospel singer and former television news anchor in this city of 380,000 people.</td>

      <td>BAGHDAD—U.S. and Iraqi authorities warned Iran and Iranian-backed militias that any attacks on American diplomats or military forces here would be met with swift retaliation as the anniversary of a U.S. drone strike that killed one of Tehran’s top military leaders approached.<br />“No one should underestimate our ability to defend our forces or to act decisively in response to any attack,” the top U.S. military commander for the Middle East, Gen. Frank McKenzie, said Wednesday.<br />Calls from Iranian-backed militia groups for violence against Americans have increased in the run-up to Jan. 3, the day last year that Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani and an Iraqi paramilitary commander with him were killed as they left Baghdad airport.<br />On Thursday, a pro-Iranian Iraqi news group on the messaging service Telegram published a picture of the U.S. Embassy captioned: “Remember always I can see what you are doing.”<br />The U.S. strike that killed Gen. Soleimani, and an Iranian counterstrike against U.S. forces with ballistic missiles, raised fears of open warfare in the Middle East. Tensions gradually eased, but Washington and Tehran remain at odds over Iran’s nuclear program and its support for foreign militias.</td>

      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />It all started with a bad hair day.<br />On the morning of April 11, Amy Watson, a preschool teacher in Portland, Ore., went to get tested for Covid-19 at a drive-up site after suffering a chronic fever. She hadn’t washed her hair, so she threw on a trucker hat with a picture of a squirrel on it, snapping a selfie to share on social media.<br />Two days later, her test came back positive. Later that month, after connecting with others who had contracted Covid and were still experiencing a range of chronic symptoms, she decided to set up a support group on  Facebook .  “I was sitting in my living room, and that hat I wore in the picture was on the coffee table,” Ms. Watson told me. The trucker hat got her thinking of long-haul trucking, inspiring her to name the Facebook group “Long Haul Covid Fighters.”<br />As the group kept growing, members began calling each other “long-haulers.” People gravitated toward the term, Ms. Watson recalls, because “it was validating as a group of patients to have a name given to what we were experiencing.”</td>

      <td>The Washington Football Team, Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants battle to win a historically bad NFC East. The AFC is stacked. And an oddball cast of quarterbacks could decide the season’s final week.</td>
      <td>There’s an NFL rule that says the winner of every division gets to make the playoffs. It doesn’t matter if that team happens to be more of a loser than a winner and is just slightly better than the other bad teams in the same division.<br />Which brings us to the bleak race to win the NFC East. One of three teams—the Washington Football Team, Dallas Cowboys or New York Giants—will be remembered as perhaps the worst division winner in NFL history. The others will live with the ignominy of failing to win an historically moribund division.<br />It’s a fitting lowlight to end a regular season that has been strange in so many ways because of the pandemic. There were games on all seven days of the week. The Denver Broncos played a game without a quarterback. The New England Patriots were bad. The Buffalo Bills were actually good.<br />The absurdity rolls into the season’s final weekend, which features unusual scenarios as teams vie to make a newly expanded playoffs that now include a seventh team in each conference. A team with a 6-10 record could win the NFC East. A team with an 11-5 record could miss the playoffs entirely in the AFC. A team with an 8-8 record could win a wild-card spot in the NFC.<br />There’s one other key factor in this playoff picture: the virus that has disrupted the entire country and NFL season. The Cleveland Browns, one of the AFC contenders, are actively battling an outbreak that forced the closure of their facility and has sidelined players and staff. New positives test results rolled in Wednesday and Thursday, casting doubt on the status of their critical game.</td>

      <td>Destination spas are positioning themselves as refuges during the pandemic—moving treatments outside and getting creative with their stress-busting cures. ‘Eye hug,’ anyone?</td>
      <td>NEVER MIND the Sweet Slumber massage or the Spiritual Warrior facial. The greatest relaxation Sarah Evans experienced during her October getaway to Miraval Berkshires spa in Lenox, Mass., involved hands-off treatments. These included opportunities to hurl hatchets at tree trunk targets or to enjoy a shamanic sound healing, where Ms. Evans, a New York City publicist and mother of three young children, lay on a yoga mat bathed in the vibrations of crystal singing bowls. Hands-on cures—the antithesis to social-distancing—may have lost their appeal during the pandemic but spas still tout their stress-busting activities, and some weary quarantiners are heeding their call.<br />Lynne McNees, president of the International Spa Association (ISPA), a trade group, said that it’s too early to gauge Covid-19’s impact on the $19-billion spa industry. But, she added, since most large destination spas reopened in June, demand has been steady, with individual visits rising even as groups like bridal parties have stayed away. Ms. Evans has already booked another spa break for this month, this time in the Hamptons. “It would be incredible to go sit on a beach somewhere, but I want to take care of myself,” she said. “Everything feels more intense right now.”<br />The isolation brought on by the coronavirus has created a secondary crisis. Reported symptoms of anxiety, depression and other disorders have more than tripled since 2019, according to a September study by the American Medical Association. With their ample open spaces, destination spas say they can help. Their activity calendars were packed with rituals focused on stress relief and spiritual well-being long before the term “coronavirus” entered our lexicons, and they’re now positioning themselves as points of refuge in the pandemic.<br />That spin has merit, said Dr. Stephanie Silvera, an epidemiologist and professor at Montclair State University, in New Jersey. Spa-based activities like rock-climbing and hiking boost health in multiple ways. “We know that stress has an impact on the immune system, and cardiovascular activities help calm you,” said Ms. Silvera. “So if you can do them outside, with spacing, there’s a lot of value and benefit.”<br />No evidence suggests that Covid-19 can spread in chlorinated pools. Saunas are a fairly safe bet, too, if heated to at least 158 degrees Fahrenheit, said Dr. Silvera. The virus cannot survive those temperatures. But Dr. Silvera cautioned that no magic scenario, whether outdoors or not, can entirely erase the risk of Covid-19. Masks, social distancing and strict sanitation remain important measures. “Imagine that each preventive behavior is a layer of Swiss cheese that has some holes, and when you layer them, those holes go away,” she said.</td>

(OK, fine, we didn’t think Quibi would die that quickly.)<br />Now, 2020 has become the lens through which all our 2021 predictions are glimpsed. As we continue to live in a pandemic-fighting world, innovators will aim tech solutions at our personal and professional lives, from at-home streaming movie debuts to an overdue evolutionary leap of the laptop. But we will also strive to reach a new normal, and you’ll see technology helping us there, too, from new hybrid work practices to high-tech masks.

Samsung  has already announced that its forthcoming Galaxy smartphone, expected in early 2021, will improve video recording and calling. We anticipate laptop makers will do the same and finally ditch their crappy, low-resolution webcams.</td>

      <td>A Cornish manor becomes a symbol of long-held illusions in a comic tale of aristocracy’s end.</td>
      <td>In a song of 1938, Noël Coward wrote: “The stately homes of England / How beautiful they stand, / To prove the upper classes / Have still the upper hand. / Though the fact that they have to be rebuilt / And frequently mortgaged to the hilt / Is inclined to take the gilt / Off the gingerbread . . .”<br />Hannah Rothschild’s new comic novel “House of Trelawney” is about an ancestral home in Cornwall where the gilt has definitely come off. Trelawney Castle, situated on a bluff overlooking the ocean, has belonged to the same noble family for 800 years. “The castle was their three-dimensional calling card, the physical embodiment of their wealth and influence,” writes Ms. Rothschild. “Each Earl added an extension until it was declared the grandest, if not the finest, stately home in the county of Cornwall.”<br />It sounds wonderful. It’s not. The novel opens in 2008, and the castle has fallen into “chaos and decrepitude.” The bungling and ineptitude of the last eight dissolute earls, “along with two world wars, the Wall Street Crash, three divorces and inheritance taxes” has eaten up the estate. There were once medieval oak woods, meadows and waterfalls on the 500,000 acres known as “Trelawneyshire.” Now ponds have silted up, hedges are bedraggled, and arches are covered with vines. Inside the castle, which has a room for each day of the year, empty squares discolor walls where great paintings once hung. In the rooms “the huge side tables were covered in a layer of dust and detritus, and a grand piano sat in a pool of water.” And the decay is accelerating: “Occasionally a great crash of avalanching plaster could be heard falling like a tree in a faraway wood.”<br />In 1988 the 24th Earl of Trelawney, now aged 85, handed the pile to his feckless son and heir, Kitto. His oldest and smartest child, Blaze, couldn’t inherit because she was female. Such were Britain’s archaic rules of primogeniture. With no funds left for its upkeep Kitto, like many an earl or duke before him, was forced to marry for money. Jane, his dowdy bride, possessed a fortune. But, inevitably, Jane’s money ran out. So did the heating and hot water. Now she is martyr to the cause, the house “skivvy,” feeding her aging parents-in-law and three teenage children cut-price mince (ground beef). She delivers pots of hot water to the freezing elderly earl and countess who reside upstairs in a fantasy world peopled with imaginary housemaids and butlers. They still change into formal clothes (now rather shabby) for dinner.<br />Meanwhile, in London, the estranged Blaze is living in a different world. There are no drip-filled buckets or creeping mold in the modern white-and-beige apartment, complete with four-person Jacuzzi, she has bought near Tower Bridge. A financial wizard, Blaze is a senior partner at the highly successful firm of Kerkyra Capital, where she has been riding out the turbulence of the 2008 crash. Her life and Jane’s are reconnected when a long-lost, wildly beautiful friend who married a maharaja 20 years before writes from India that she is dying of dengue fever (seriously). She asks Blaze and Jane to take in her daughter, Ayesha. Of course, when the 19-year-old arrives, she brings a new layer of chaos.</td>

The U.S. enjoys all of these advantages but mounted one of the worst responses to the pandemic: 1 in every 990 Americans has died from Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Bad politics, quite simply, can trump good public health.<br />Other developed countries that did well initially, such as Canada and some European nations, have faltered during the second or third surge of infections, because their governments and people grew tired of implementing effective strategies. In many Asian countries, it has long been common for people to wear masks when feeling ill, so they adopted masks early and widely.<br />Best at early action: Taiwan<br />1 reported Covid-19 death per 3,366,140 people</td>

      <td>WHEN I LEARNED that  Ford  was calling its all-electric crossover Mustang Mach-E, I rolled my eyes and made the skeptical emoji face. Ladies and gentlemen of Dearborn, please. Can we not go down the road of misty pony-car nostalgia, again? Must we give credence to this weird non sequitur? For 56 years the nameplate has denoted two-door coupes and convertibles; now, for no particular good reason I can tell, it also denotes a midsize electric four-door hatchback—oh, sorry, fastback. They might as well have called it a Cobra, or Crown Victoria, or the Barney Oldfield 999 Special.<br />Ford’s engineering execs have been on teleconference press tours this fall in support of the company’s first mass-market EV, to be built in Mexico, with global sales expected to be around 50,000 in the first year. They have explained how, late in the design phase, vice president Jim Farley (now CEO) sent the team back to the drawing boards with orders to make the then-unnamed project more Mustang-ish—more raked windshield, faster hatch, blacked-out C-pillar—until finally someone suggested they just call it a Mustang.<br />Really? This high-sitting four-door hatchback with the dad bod screamed Mustang to management? That’s... surprising. Ford execs repeat this story as if it weren’t a parable of creative laziness.<br />Not to be a killjoy. Some of the Mustang-themed features are charming: the three-bar taillights; the illuminated galloping mustang logo in the nose (GT trim and above). The three drive modes are “Whisper,” “Engage” and “Unbridled.” Oh, honey! The latter mode corresponds to a typical sport mode, putting a sharper edge on the throttle response and adding heft to the steering feel. The Unbridled mode also permits a certain value of wheel spin, at both front and rear axles, so you can horse around a bit...sorry.<br />Idiomatic note: In UK-market cars the sport mode is called Untamed. Grrr. No word on ripped-bodice upholstery.</td>

Chief Executive Ed Bastian expects improvement starting this spring. Alaska Airlines President Ben Minicucci said he hopes to get back to 80% of pre-pandemic capacity by summer. United CEO Scott Kirby, however, said travel may not start getting back to normal until vaccines are widely distributed—in late 2021.<br />“I recognize a lot of people are saying it’s going to happen faster, and I hope they’re right,” he said in a December interview. “This is one of those strange situations where I think we’re probably better at forecasting what’s going to happen a year from now than we are what’s going to happen next quarter.”<br />Their strategies for coping with the uncertainty are just as diverse. Airlines are shutting down some international markets and running reduced schedules while also buying new planes and adding new cities in an attempt to capture demand where it exists. United is returning to New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in February after a five-year absence, while rival  Southwest Airlines Co.  plans to fly from Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport for the first time ever in 2021.  JetBlue Airways Corp.  is also adding flights this year at Miami International Airport—the busiest U.S. airport it didn’t yet serve.<br />The coronavirus pandemic brought a travel boom to a crashing halt last spring as people stopped traveling for work and everything from weddings to funerals were held over Zoom. It wiped out over two-decades worth of growth in a matter of months, according to aviation data provider Cirium, sending global air traffic plummeting to levels last seen in 1999.</td>

But a number of expansive, well-considered shows are planned for this year, including solo exhibitions spotlighting innovative contemporary artists. Several of those artists shared thoughts on the past year and what they’re looking forward to in 2021. (Dates may change, so it’s best to check with museums before visiting.)<br />Intense physicality and an expressive hand give the geometric abstractions of Sean Scully, 75, a resonantly human touch. His retrospective, “Sean Scully: The Shape of Ideas,” is slated to open in June at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Much of Mr. Scully’s studio time last year was devoted to his continuing “Landline” series of paintings, in which horizontal bands of varying colors evoke landscapes and horizons. He also worked on “more nihilistic, pessimistic paintings, with black squares in the middle. Which I find very symbolic of the time,” he said. In 2021, he is looking forward to “Jasper Johns: Mind/Mirror,” a nearly 500-work retrospective that will open Sept. 29 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.<br />For Bisa Butler, the term that best describes the current moment is “hyperdrive.” After months of focused studio time, “I feel my own mind so full of ideas, projects and future collaborations,” she said, noting that the lockdown “has emboldened me to connect with people I admire.” Ms. Butler, 47, reinterprets vintage photographs of African-Americans as oversize, brilliantly colored quilts, playing pattern against pattern and layering fabrics to create nuanced tones. “Bisa Butler: Portraits” opened at the Art Institute of Chicago in November, a few days before the museum shut down; the show will continue when the Art Institute reopens.<br />Among the artists Ms. Butler is hoping to see more of in 2021 are Faith Ringgold, Romare Bearden and El Anatsui. She is also looking forward to the emergence of new work by other artists, noting that “as these projects come to fruition, we will see the creative abundance of the lockdown.”<br />Pat Steir, 80, creates abstract paintings by pouring, splashing and flinging color at the canvas. Often an element of chance is skillfully factored into the process. Between uninterrupted studio time and postponed exhibitions, “the lockdown is a kind of dream and nightmare in one,” she said. When the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. reopens, “Pat Steir: Color Wheel”—a massive, 30-painting installation spanning the circular inner gallery on the museum’s second floor—will resume its interrupted run.</td>

      <td>The president-elect and House speaker share trust, faith and long experience legislating together</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The relationship between President-elect Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spans more than three decades. They now must  draw on those ties to steer a divided Democratic coalition amid a pandemic and an economy recovering from a deep slump.<br />The president-elect and speaker have both reached the highest levels in U.S. party politics by forging coalitions among disparate members of their party, including moderates and progressives, according to their allies and advisers. The pair’s history of legislating together has created what colleagues describe as mutual trust.<br />Mr. Biden and Mrs. Pelosi, who both hope to start by passing additional measures to address the coronavirus pandemic, must unite party members who have bickered over issues such as expanding government health insurance, how much to spend to combat climate change and criminal-justice policy.<br />The pair also must work with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York to win over enough Republicans to clear that chamber’s 60-vote threshold for most bills. Control of the Senate—which could determine the success or failure of much of the Democratic agenda—hinges on the outcome of two Jan. 5 runoff races in Georgia.<br />The last time a Democratic president came into office, the party had a comfortable House majority and briefly held a Senate supermajority. This time, with two House races not called, Democrats have only a few more seats than the 218 required for a House majority. Mr. Biden has tapped three House lawmakers to serve in his administration, which will temporarily shrink the majority further.</td>

      <td>Jay DeFeo’s monumental ‘The Rose’ weighed 2,300 pounds when completed.</td>
      <td>Some artists are identified with a single work. With Leonardo da Vinci it’s the Mona Lisa, with Grant Wood it’s “American Gothic.” Which brings us to Jay DeFeo (1929-1989) and her strange, huge sculptural painting, “The Rose” (1958-66).<br />DeFeo was one of those lucky kids whose talent and enthusiasm for art was noticed early on by a high-school teacher; in her case it was Lena Emery in San Jose, Calif. The mentoring led to museum visits in San Francisco and, eventually, a master’s degree from the University of California, Berkeley, followed by a grant for a trip to Europe and North Africa. In 1954 she married Wally Hedrick, one of the weirder of the many weird Bay Area artists, and set up shop in a large second-floor space on Fillmore Street in jazz- and beatnik-infused San Francisco. By 1958, DeFeo was ready to start a work that she seems to have known, in an inchoate way, would end up her masterpiece with a capital M.<br />In it, she grayed down her colors from her earlier Abstract Expressionism-influenced paintings, and then built up the paint by applying it almost like plaster. She’d painted small pictures of relatively realistic single roses before, but this one would be a monumental rose—a huge painting so physically thick that it would border on sculpture. In DeFeo’s words, it was simply an “idea that had a center to it.” That idea initially checked in at about seven feet wide by nine feet tall, but within a year the artist—with the help of some friends—mounted the work on an even larger canvas, about 11 feet high. DeFeo painted and painted and painted—from 1958 into 1966—chiseling into the material when it had dried. To prevent the work from sagging to the point of collapse, she inserted wooden dowels from the rear to prop up its surface. In the end, “The Rose”—which DeFeo called “a marriage between painting and sculpture”—weighed over a ton.<br />“The Rose” is built on one of the hokiest compositional clichés—a starburst from a pinpoint center—and it’s executed in another decorator’s commonplace, fluting that causes its ostensibly unoriginal arrangement to exist in actual light and shadow. Superficially, “The Rose” has no right to come across as anything more than a rococo-modernist backdrop for some megabank’s conference room. But it’s a genuinely beautiful and powerful work of art.<br />The center of “The Rose” is as threatening as it is pretty, as knife-like as it is floral. Its burst, as it were, doesn’t extend conveniently all the way to the edges of the painting. Instead, as the furrows expand outward from the center, they gradually transition into being defined at their edges by larger lumps of paint until just before the physical borders of the work.</td>

      <td>Platform turned its first profitable quarter and increased revenue 7% during the pandemic</td>
      <td>When the pandemic hit, the chief executive of car-renting startup Turo Inc. thought back to how slowly he had responded to the dot-com bust. It didn’t end well for his startup at the time.<br />This time, Andre Haddad decided to be more aggressive. At the end of March, Mr. Haddad laid off a third of his 330-person workforce. The next month, he cut spending on marketing to zero, where it would stay for the entire second quarter. He studied every expense to try to find savings and shore up three years of cash.<br />Turo’s financial turnaround suggests the moves are working. The peer-to-peer car-renting marketplace reported its first-ever profitable quarter this year, according to results shared with The Wall Street Journal, and Mr. Haddad forecasts achieving full-year profitability in 2022, before adjusting for interest and taxes.<br />Mr. Haddad plans to publicly list shares of Turo this year, buoyed by the company’s success and following the strong performance of many tech initial public offerings in 2020. He is undecided whether he will pursue a traditional IPO and is open to alternatives, such as going public through a merger with a blank-check corporation.<br />Turo is a website where private car owners rent their vehicles by the day, week or month, including luxury rides like Lamborghinis. The car-renting marketplace joins  Airbnb Inc.  in a category of startups that looked precarious at the start of the pandemic but have since benefited from an unexpected shift in consumer behavior during widespread lockdown orders.</td>

Even so, funds won’t be enough to meet the strain of the latest nationwide surge, said Rick Pollack, the American Hospital Association’s chief executive. More than 125,000 Covid-19 patients were in U.S. hospitals as of Wednesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project, another national record.<br />“The surge in cases is ongoing,” said Tom Nickels, the association’s executive vice president, increasing hospitals’ financial strain from higher staffing and supply costs for Covid-19 patients and revenue losses, as other services are suspended. “We anticipate we will need additional funding.”<br />New limits on relief may also inadvertently disadvantage hospitals with patients most severely affected by the pandemic, health-policy experts said.</td>

      <td>BlackRock Inc.  planned to shake up the private-equity world with a $12 billion fund. Now the asset-management giant is setting its sights lower.<br />BlackRock’s staffers conceded the target was unrealistic after struggling to meet fundraising goals. The firm’s staffers hope to grow the fund to between $4 billion and $6 billion in assets over time, people familiar with the matter said.<br />Best known for funds that track broad markets and trade on exchanges, BlackRock launched fundraising for a strategy in 2018 to make direct, long-term investments in private companies. The fund was an aggressive gambit to take on private equity’s big league deal makers.<br />Private markets are one of the few corners of finance untouched by fee pressures that have pulled the cost of investing closer to zero. But it is hard to build a presence from scratch. Many asset managers face challenges replicating their reach over stock-and-bond markets in the complex, labor-intensive business of investing in privately held companies.<br />So far, BlackRock has raised less than one-third of its original goal—$3.4 billion, as of the end of 2020, according to people familiar with the matter. BlackRock, which had an initial year-and-a-half window to raise money for the fund, missed internal fundraising deadlines and asked investors for a few more months to seek money, according to some of the people familiar with the matter. Now BlackRock can’t raise further money until 80% of that money is invested, fund documents dictate.</td>

The Federal Reserve’s massive stimulus package and, later, news of a vaccine, stoked a simultaneous rally in various markets. The moves have been underpinned by an excitement for investing that hasn’t been seen in decades, as people of all ages jumped into the market to ride its wild moves.<br />Stocks soared in 2020. After plunging into a bear market—defined as a drop of at least 20%—a new bull market emerged, one that raced to new highs faster than ever before. The S&P 500 climbed 16.3% to end the year at a record, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 44%, its best year since 2009. The Russell 2000 small-cap stock index has roughly doubled from its March low.<br />The pandemic “put the U.S. economy and markets on the biggest bust-to-boom roller coaster we’ve seen,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. “It caused people to dump far more when it was collapsing—has caused them to chase assets on the way up.”<br />Here are five investment trends that boomed in 2020, defying many market watchers’ expectations.

      <td>Investors are enthusiastic about QuantumScape, developer of an electric-vehicle battery that promises more power for less cost. If the company succeeds, Tesla could face new challenges.</td>
      <td>One of the wildest plotlines in the great 2020 electric-vehicle rally was the late-year rise of  QuantumScape ,  a battery startup that has yet to report any revenue. If investors are even close to being right about its roughly $44 billion market value, they may need to worry more about the fortunes of Tesla.<br />QuantumScape’s shares have soared since going public in November. The company revealed promising test results for a limited version of its “solid state” battery in early December, but otherwise the stock’s meteoric ascent has been hard to explain.<br />Based in San Jose, Calif., and backed by  Volkswagen  and Bill Gates, the company now has a market value greater than  Ford .  Investors have gotten used to dizzying valuations for electric-vehicle startups positioning themselves as the next Tesla. With QuantumScape, the mania has reached potential suppliers too.<br />Solid-state batteries have long been seen as a way of breaking through performance limitations associated with today’s electric vehicles. Like your smartphone, a Tesla or  BMW  i3 is powered by a battery with a liquid electrolyte that carries lithium ions back and forth between the cathode and anode during charging and discharging. These liquid electrolytes are bulky and liable to overheat.  General Motors recalled almost 69,000 Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles in November after five reported fires.<br />The promise of solid state is to get rid of the liquid, and with it the fire risk. Moreover, “lithium-metal” cells being developed by QuantumScape, among others, combine the lithium component with the anode, further reducing bulk and potentially delivering more power at a lower cost. This is also critical: Electric vehicles have long been held back by the relatively high cost of batteries, which makes them more expensive than combustion-engine equivalents.</td>

      <td>From stimulus checks to early retirement-plan withdrawals, here are some late-breaking items that could alter either your 2020 return or how you approach your taxes in the year to come</td>
      <td>With taxes, small changes often add up to big differences—and major confusion.<br />Last year Congress passed two important bills in response to Covid-19 that contain a slew of tax changes, with the most recent one signed by President Trump on Dec. 27. Some of the changes apply only to 2020, while others affect more than one year or take effect beginning in 2021. The new year also brings automatic inflation adjustments that slightly shift tax brackets and some other thresholds.<br />That’s a lot to keep straight, so here’s a rundown of the most recent tax changes and when they apply, according to the Senate Finance Committee, plus an overview of this year’s key tax numbers. Happier New Year in 2021!<br />• Stimulus payments. The year-end relief and spending package just signed into law includes a second round of stimulus checks. This payment is up to $600 per taxpayer ($1,200 for married joint filers) plus $600 per qualifying child under age 17. It begins to phase out at $75,000 of adjusted gross income for most single filers and $150,000 of AGI for most married joint filers. For individuals without children, the payments go to zero when income reaches $87,000, or $174,000 for couples filing jointly. The second round of stimulus payments, like the first, isn’t taxable.<br />Payments are already going out, and most are based on taxpayers’ income as listed on their 2019 tax returns. If the recipients’ 2020 income turns out to be much higher, they won’t need to give the payments back. Taxpayers who earned too much in 2019 to receive checks but whose income dropped enough to qualify for the stimulus can claim payments through their 2020 tax returns.</td>

A hand recount that concluded Dec. 7, the Electoral College vote on Dec. 14, and the simple passing of time have made the result seem final, even among voters who doubt it.<br />But for weeks, widespread denial among Republicans obscured the result’s significance. With 49.5% of the vote to President Trump’s 49.3%, Mr. Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1992 to carry Georgia. No Democrat since Bill Clinton had won any state in the once solidly Democratic Deep South, defined to include Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina along with the Peach State.<br />Until this year, Southern Senate delegations seemed to have undergone a similar Republican realignment. With the exception of Alabama’s Doug Jones, who edged out a scandal-plagued Republican nominee in a 2017 special election (and was soundly defeated for a full term in November), no Democrat has won a Deep South Senate seat since 2008, and not one has unseated a Republican incumbent since 1986.</td>

      <td>You have to go into this year with dreams, there’s no other way to do it. We’re still in an epic struggle, and it will be a while before things settle down into some approximation of normal. Dreams are how we got through 2020, or maybe not dreams precisely but a picture you kept in your head that helped you keep going, that captured what you missed and will have again. It was a picture of When the Pandemic is Over and we carried it in our psychic wallets.<br />My friend John’s picture: He’s in Fenway Park, the seats are full and close together, and he orders a Fenway Frank and chowder, and the other people in the row pass them down without fear or masks. Someone gets a hit and no one’s afraid to cheer. He is certain this will come.<br />My friend the professor would see this: He and his students are in a room, and he is teaching them. For what seems like forever they’ve been postage-size faces on Gallery View on Zoom, which is how they see him. But in his head they’re together and know each other and he’s Mr. Chips again, not Max Headroom.<br />A friend who’s a reporter kept in her head the idea of future spontaneity. She’d be on the phone with a friend: Whatcha doin’? Wanna get in a car and get lost? What if we just show up and surprise them? Let’s see who’s in town.<br />My vision of 2021, the picture I held of that future, came into my head in early summer. This would come: We are gathered in a darkened theater, 1,500 of us, for the first time since March 2020. The orchestra starts, the curtain rises, and on the stage a crowded old railroad coach is in full cry. The train conductor booms, “River City next station stop!” And in the audience applause starts, unplanned, just erupting, and the actors playing the salesmen on the train play through. “Ya can talk-talk-talk. . . . Ya can talk all ya wanna, but it’s different than it was.” Suddenly a tall man in a natty suit comes forward: “Gentlemen, you intrigue me. I think I’ll have to give Iowa a try.” It’s Professor Harold Hill, the Music Man. He’s played by Hugh Jackman. We’re at the revival that was supposed to open in 2020. Now pent-up emotion really breaks out and what builds is a wave of unstoppable cheers, and then we can’t help it, we stand.

      <td>The latest Census population statistics show a shift from blue to red.</td>
      <td>President Trump is soon expected to submit to Congress state population counts from this year’s Census for reapportionment. Last week the Census Bureau gave a preview of what to expect, and blue-state Democrats might want to prepare their smelling salts in advance.<br />Sixteen mostly coastal and Rust Belt states lost population from July 2019 to July 2020, according to the Census Bureau’s annual population survey, and Illinois, West Virginia, New York, Connecticut, Mississippi and Vermont have shrunk since 2010. At the same time, many low-tax Sun Belt states have continued to attract newcomers.<br />The pandemic may have contributed to population losses in some states as city dwellers with means escaped to rental and vacation homes. Foreign immigration also fell after President Trump suspended new green cards in April. Some states, especially in the Northeast, experienced thousands of more deaths than usual due to Covid.<br />But the bureau’s annual population estimate captures only the first few months of the pandemic when migration generally declined as most people hunkered down. Geographic mobility increased over the summer and fall, and the pandemic seems to have accelerated migration flows that have been occurring for years. States such as New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and California have counted on foreign immigration offsetting net out-migration. That didn’t happen this year, so many states lost population for the first time in decades.<br />California’s population shrank for the first time as far back as records go (-69,532). According to a separate state government survey, a net 261,000 residents moved to other states during the period, the most in nearly 25 years. High housing costs have been driving out the middle class for years. But now many large businesses are shifting workforces to other states.</td>

      <td>The crackdown continues in Hong Kong, and this week the Chinese government made an example of the territory’s most prominent political prisoners.<br />Publisher Jimmy Lai is back in jail after Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal revoked his bail. A long-time democracy advocate and critic of the Communist Party, Mr. Lai faces multiple charges for participating in last year’s Hong Kong protests, and authorities have also charged him under the new national-security law, which effectively outlaws dissent.<br />The maximum sentence is life in prison, and there’s no guarantee that Chinese authorities won’t extradite Mr. Lai to the mainland. A lower court enraged Beijing last week when it granted bail and allowed Mr. Lai to await his trial under house arrest as long as he refrained from giving interviews, posting on social media, or making public statements.<br />The prosecution cited Article 42 of the security law, which states that no bail can be granted “unless the judge has sufficient grounds for believing the criminal suspect or defendant will not continue to commit acts endangering national security.” Mr. Lai poses no such threat. He has bravely chosen not to flee despite having a British passport, and China wants to make an example of him to stifle all criticism.<br />Meanwhile on the mainland, a Shenzhen court meted out harsh sentences for 10 Hong Kongers who were arrested as they fled by boat to Taiwan. Authorities wouldn’t let these thwarted refugees meet with the lawyers hired by their families, and on Wednesday the court sentenced the 10 to between seven months and three years, almost certainly to be spent in China’s opaque and notorious prison system.</td>

      <td>Whether or not they make it to the Super Bowl, the Buffalo Bills have already pulled off a miracle victory: persuading New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to let 6,700 fans attend their playoff game next weekend.<br />The Bills have won the AFC East division for the first time in 25 years and will host their first home playoff game since 1996. Buffalo could use the morale boost. It sure hasn’t received one from the billions of dollars Mr. Cuomo has spent trying to revive the western New York economy.<br />Mr. Cuomo has kept Bill fans locked out of the stadium all season, though 13 other NFL stadiums have allowed limited numbers to attend games. There has been only one report of a fan testing positive after an NFL game. Yet in November Mr. Cuomo proclaimed it would be “reckless” to let any fans into a stadium that could seat nearly 72,000.<br />Perhaps feeling the holiday spirit or pressure from upstate voters, Mr. Cuomo has reversed course. “We’re all feeling the excitement,” Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday. “We’ve all wanted the Buffalo Bills to be good, it’s been a long time, and that team has a charisma and personality that is infectious.”<br />The Governor’s plan requires all fans to be tested before the game and wear masks. The state also plans to hold drive-through rapid testing at the stadium, which he says would be a pilot for reopening businesses and live events.</td>

      <td>An audit in one county finds no fraud, but it puts officials on notice.</td>
      <td>Georgia’s audit of the November mail vote in Cobb County found “no fraudulent absentee ballots.” In a report Tuesday, the Secretary of State’s office explained how investigators double checked the signatures on 15,118 randomly chosen ballot envelopes. It’s a good warning to anybody contemplating shenanigans in Georgia’s Senate runoffs next week.<br />About 150,000 people in Cobb County voted by mail, so the sample was nearly 10% of the total. Most of the accepted signatures were clearly valid. Investigators ended up with 10 suspect envelopes. On eight of them, the signature “did not appear to be consistent with documents on record.” But once the voters were contacted, they confirmed the signatures were theirs. Handwriting can change, especially as people age.<br />That left two problem votes. One was missing a signature, and the voter “reported signing the front of the envelope only.” The other ballot was correctly voted, but then its envelope was “mistakenly signed by the elector’s spouse.” In both cases, the state said, Cobb County should have asked the voter to fix the mistake before accepting the ballot.<br />These are ordinary screw ups, not the mass fraud that President Trump claims. Two bad ballots out of 15,118 is an error rate of 0.013%. If you extrapolate that to Georgia’s 1,316,943 mail votes, it suggests 174 questionable ballots statewide. There are reasons to roll back mail voting, which could be a debacle if the margin were closer. But Mr. Trump lost Georgia by 12,000.<br />It’s good news that no fraud was found, yet some Trump supporters appear unwilling to accept defeat no matter the evidence. They include Mr. Trump, who tweeted: “When are we going to be allowed to do signature verification in Fulton County, Georgia?” The big difference is that in Cobb County a temporary election worker made a specific allegation to investigate.</td>

He writes that states directed their own pandemic policies, with governors and local officials responsible for outcomes. A lack of leadership from the White House left them no other choice. For example, Washington’s Opening Up America Again guidelines were well-received, but the administration promptly ignored them, pushing states to open before reaching important health benchmarks.<br />Jared Kushner relayed President Trump’s posture to Bob Woodward: The states would be responsible for the public-health burden while he’d own the reopening. “The opening is going to be very popular,” Mr. Kushner said.<br />An October Gallup report concluded that “the most important factor in Americans’ decision to [take Covid precautions seriously] is exposure to accurate information about the pandemic from sources they trust.” Mr. Trump played down Covid’s seriousness, belittled masks, flaunted CDC guidelines and ran a White House that became a Covid epicenter.

      <td>William A. Galston tees up Washington’s next massive stimulus package as essential to avoid a double-dip recession (“Can Team Biden Prevent a Recession?” Politics & Ideas, Dec. 23). Mr. Galston is concerned that “the pace of job growth has declined for five straight months and may have ceased in December.” Normal cyclical forces could be swamped by “structural changes” that were accelerated by the pandemic.<br />This may be unsettling, but the pace of job growth was destined to fall after a fairly rapid recovery from an extraordinary spike in job losses. Compare this with the 2007-09 recession. The unemployment rate peaked around 10% nine months into President Obama’s first year and didn’t drop to 6.7% for 50 months until December 2013. In 2020 the unemployment rate soared to nearly 15% in April and dropped to 6.7% only seven months later in November.<br />Secular stagnation was the excuse made for eight years of modest growth and slow labor-market recovery under Mr. Obama’s stewardship. It seems that Mr. Biden’s will be structural changes, but one guesses his solutions will be similar. Washington will pick up the economic slack with more stimulus, more federal “investments” in favored industries and state and local governments, more regulations and higher taxes.<br />How many trillions of dollars of federal spending will it take to get back to President Trump’s prepandemic unemployment rate of 3.5%? The rate didn’t get below 4.7% during the Obama-Biden years. Let’s hope the Biden-Harris solution isn’t to hire five million more federal workers.<br />Ryan Graham</td>

Louie Gohmert of Texas, a “walking legal contradiction” because it takes aim at the vice president, “ironically the very person whose power they seek to promote.”<br />The lawsuit, filed by Mr. Gohmert and a number of Republicans in Arizona, challenges the procedures governing Congress’ counting of electoral votes next week, which will cement Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.<br />Those long-established measures, spelled out in the Electoral Count Act of 1887, say the vice president’s role in announcing the election results is purely ceremonial. Mr. Gohmert argued the process unconstitutionally binds Mr. Pence from exercising “exclusive authority” to determine which elector votes to count at the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress he oversees.<br />The Justice Department suggested that Mr. Gohmert might instead sue Congress itself, since the 1887 law vests the legislature with powers they are seeking to transfer to Mr. Pence.</td>

Ms. Yellen began consulting for the firm one year after leaving her post as Federal Reserve chairwoman in early 2018.<br />The agreement said Ms. Yellen would seek special authorization for one year when dealing with matters pertaining to Magellan, according to forms posted online by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.<br />The agreement outlines similar steps she would take for 16 additional financial firms or entities from which she collected speaking fees in the past year, including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,   Citigroup  Inc.  and hedge-fund firm Citadel LLC. Those measures would be in place until one year after the speaking fee was paid.<br />Like many former government officials, Ms. Yellen signed a contract shortly after leaving the Fed with the Washington Speakers Bureau, an agency that helps former heads of state and other political personalities manage scores of speaking requests. Ms. Yellen has spoken frequently since leaving the central bank on the economic outlook and monetary policy, a topic of intense interest to Wall Street firms that closely follow the Fed.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for secretary of state took a high-dollar foray into international consulting and venture capital during the Trump administration, a career move that followed long years in public service in the White House, State Department and halls of Congress, according to financial disclosures released Thursday.<br />Tony Blinken, seen as likely to be confirmed as chief diplomat in January, is co-founder and managing partner at a consulting firm that includes other former officials from the Obama administration’s national security team. The firm, WestExec Advisors LLC, paid him $1.2 million, not including an expected payment of between $250,000 and $500,000 for 2020, according to the disclosures, filed through the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.<br />Meanwhile, Avril Haines, Mr. Biden’s selection for director of national intelligence, has an extensive résumé that includes consulting work with national-security data analysis company  Palantir Technologies Inc.  and WestExec Advisors, and as a fellow at the nonpartisan public policy research organization Brookings Institution. Ms. Haines has resigned from those posts and says she will recuse herself from all business with them for one year. The bulk of her income comes from her position as a research scholar and lecturer at Columbia University, where she was paid a salary of $440,121.<br />The disclosures demonstrate what has long been a pattern in Washington: Senior officials from one political party find private work in their areas of expertise during an administration led by a president from the other party, in this case President Trump’s Republican Party. Companies and investors have eagerly sought strategic advice from veteran Washington lawyers and consultants as they navigated political and policy changes in the Trump administration, and former officials with international experience were useful in grappling with tariffs and new attitudes toward international deals, U.S. allies and China.<br />Mr. Blinken and Ms. Haines will face questions about their work in hearings expected in early 2021. The Senate is expected to announce the schedules for confirmation hearings for Mr. Blinken, Ms. Haines and others soon after the Georgia Senate runoff, which will determine partisan control of the Senate, according to a person familiar with the planning. Typically, hearings for key posts occur ahead of the inauguration to have key national security posts ready for a final confirmation on Jan. 20, the day of the ceremony. In 2017, the Senate confirmed Jim Mattis as secretary of defense and John Kelly as head of the Department of Homeland Security on the same day President Trump was sworn in.</td>

Others, in Iowa and Minnesota, moved the ceremonies outdoors,” he wrote, “borrowing a practice from a century ago, when San Francisco courts held proceedings outdoors during the Spanish flu pandemic.”<br />The high court sent employees to work from home in March, and in May began hearing cases by teleconference, a practice that continues.

Now they need to explain the slow pace of vaccinations.<br />Around two out of every thousand people in New York and New Jersey have died with Covid this year, roughly double the rate in Florida and Texas. By placing strict limits on individual liberty while also failing to prioritize the protection of the elderly, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D.) has achieved the ignominy of presiding over both the highest per capita Covid death rate and the nation’s highest unemployment rate.<br />It’s a remarkable occurrence that New Jersey joblessness exceeds even the pain in states like Hawaii and Nevada which rely heavily on the hospitality and travel industries. New Jersey’s unemployment rate is also much higher than Florida’s. Across the Hudson River from the Garden State, New York’s grim stats have been almost as awful as New Jersey’s. Maybe it’s all about the highly populated metro area.<br />One might assume that population density would be more help than hindrance in a vaccination campaign, but according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control, New Jersey and New York have barely been able to climb to the level of mediocrity.<br />The vaccination effort has only recently begun and perhaps reporting lags around the holidays are obscuring the full story. But so far the national leader in administering Covid vaccinations is West Virginia.  Perhaps Mr. Murphy and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D.)  can learn from the Mountain State example.</td>

      <td>Software giant says it saw ‘unusual activity’ on a few accounts that led it to discover the breach</td>
      <td>The Russia-linked hackers behind a widespread cyber-intrusion into U.S. corporate and government systems were able to access internal systems within  Microsoft Corp.  and view internal source code, used to build software products, the company said Thursday.<br />Microsoft had previously confirmed that it had downloaded malicious software from a vendor called  SolarWinds Corp.  that had been modified by the hackers. Thursday’s disclosure is the first indication that the hackers were able to access internal systems at Microsoft.<br />“We detected unusual activity with a small number of internal accounts and upon review, we discovered one account had been used to view source code in a number of source code repositories,” Microsoft said in a statement.<br />This compromised account was able to view Microsoft’s source code, but not make changes, the company said.<br />Microsoft’s disclosure raises the specter that the hackers may have targeted and then compromised other technology companies as well, said Sherri Davidoff, chief executive of the security consulting firm LMG Security LLC. “That’s why these hackers are going after these companies,” she said. “They don’t want access to just one company. They want access to everything.”</td>

He was 88.<br />Mr. Thornburgh died Thursday morning at a retirement community facility outside Pittsburgh, his son David said. The cause isn’t yet known. He suffered a mild stroke in June 2014.<br />Mr. Thornburgh built his reputation as a crime-busting federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh and as a moderate Republican governor.

He also shepherded the Americans with Disabilities Act; one of his sons had been severely brain damaged in an auto accident.<br />After leaving public office, Mr. Thornburgh became a go-to troubleshooter who helped CBS investigate its news practices, dissected illegalities at telecommunications company WorldCom and tried to improve the United Nations’ efficiency.<br />“I’ve always had an opportunity to right a vessel that was somewhat listing and taking on water,” he told the Associated Press in 1999. “I wouldn’t object to being characterized as a ‘Mr. Fix It.’ I’ve liked the day-in, day-out challenges of governance.”</td>

Rising hospital prices accounted for about one-fifth of the nation’s health spending growth in the last half-century, federal data show.<br />The nation’s largest hospital chains, including publicly traded giants  HCA Healthcare Inc.,   Universal Health Services Inc.  and  Community Health Systems Inc.,  and national nonprofit chains CommonSpirit Health and Ascension, said they planned to comply with new requirements to post pricing.

      <td>Fuel and safety mandates have made them all look the same. Expect California to step in again.</td>
      <td>First, California banned the sale of gas-powered cars after the year 2035. Then it got car companies to sign on to its own tough emission standards. It’s obvious what’s next, isn’t it? California will become the first state to mandate that by 2035, cars must cease to be visually interchangeable.<br />“You’ve got the Accord that looks like the Camry that looks like the Sonata, and this just has to stop,” says a high-ranking state official. “It’s incredibly boring to get on the 101 and drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco and maybe see three cars that don’t look like every other car. And it makes it harder to catch speeders, because all the cars look the same.”<br />“It’s really bad with vans,” adds a second, more medium-ranking official. “Car companies developed a couple of basic designs in the 1990s, and they’ve stuck with them. A van that rolled off the assembly line in 2004 doesn’t look much different than one you bought yesterday. I know. I bought one in 2004.”<br />Car companies agree that their products suffer from a pitiful uniformity. They nod remorsefully that it would be nicer for everyone if cars were not so bland, generic, sleep-inducing. Then they point out, with some pique, that aerodynamic and structural innovations intended to make cars more fuel-efficient and safer are largely to blame.<br />“Look, you’re basically dealing with a rectangular-shaped box,” says one Motor City CEO. “Short of adding Nifty Fifties fins or running boards or some kind of weird sunroof or turret, there’s just no way to make one car look different from every other car.”</td>

A Beijing-based drug-development unit of China National Pharmaceutical Group Co., known more commonly as Sinopharm, said earlier Wednesday that its shot was found to be 79% effective in protecting against Covid-19 in interim Phase 3 clinical trials overseas.<br />The vaccine, along with two other homegrown candidates, was earlier approved for emergency use in China. Beijing grants conditional approvals for vaccines that haven’t completed clinical trials if it is deemed to be urgent to cope with public health emergencies. The new approval is the first allowing for broader use of a coronavirus vaccine in the country.<br />Sinopharm has started mass production of the newly approved vaccine, Mao Junfeng, an official at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said Thursday.<br />Drugmakers must still submit final results after they receive conditional approval. Mr. Chen, the regulatory official, said authorities will keep a close eye on Sinopharm to ensure it carries out its Phase 3 trial as planned.</td>

      <td>The author of the National Book Award-winning ‘Interior Chinatown’ wittily explores the complexities of immigration and the trajectory of today’s Asian-Americans</td>
      <td>Raised by Taiwanese immigrants in Los Angeles, Charles Yu grew up trusting that American society was on a steady march toward greater racial harmony. With each new generation in the U.S., he says, “I always thought there was a progression toward inclusion.”<br />But the 45-year-old novelist is no longer so sure that applies to Asian-Americans. His second novel, “Interior Chinatown” (2020), which won the National Book Award for fiction last November, examines why some Chinese and other Asian immigrants and their children still feel confined to stereotypes and secondary roles in the U.S. Italian and Irish immigrants were reviled at first but eventually became part of mainstream U.S. society. But the main character in Mr. Yu’s novel, a Chinese-American actor named Willis Wu, struggles to find an answer to his question: “After two centuries here, why are we still not Americans? Why do we keep falling out of the story?”<br />Over the past several years, Mr. Yu has found it harder to feel optimistic about prospects for Asian-Americans. The election of President Trump in 2016 signaled a growing hostility to immigrants of all kinds, he says. Meanwhile, China is increasingly viewed as America’s most dangerous rival, and Mr. Trump has branded Covid-19 as the “China virus.”<br />Mr. Yu’s own winding road to literary stardom seems like an affirmation of the opportunities that can await immigrants and their children in the U.S. “My experience is probably just about as good as you can really come by,” but it is far from universal and filled with complexity, he says. For most of his life, Mr. Yu has felt fully American, but he has received repeated reminders that others see him differently. At one literary event, a comedian mocked him and the other Asian-American participant as interchangeable.<br />“There’s a mismatch between how I feel inside and how I look on the outside,” Mr. Yu says. In “Interior Chinatown,” the protagonist thinks, “You are Asian! Your brain forgets sometimes. But then your face reminds you.”</td>

      <td>A radiant entertainer finally gets her due as a composer and lyricist—and champion of resilience amid troubles.</td>
      <td>In the late 1960s, Dolly Parton got her big break as the “girl singer” on “The Porter Wagoner Show,” a syndicated television program that brought hard-core honky-tonk and down-home humor into the living rooms of America. It may be hard to believe now, but back then Ms. Parton was only the second most flamboyant performer onstage. One of country music’s most magnetic stars, Wagoner had a peroxide pompadour and eye-popping, rhinestone-studded Nudie suits that defined Nashville glitz. Meanwhile, “Miss Dolly,” as he called her, was kept buttoned up in demure outfits despite her natural radiance and zest.<br />Underpaid and underappreciated, Ms. Parton would later compare her seven-year stint with Wagoner to the time that indentured servants were required to work in order to earn their freedom. It was indeed a raw deal, but it was worth it. It gave her national exposure and performing experience with a peerless entertainer twice her age. It also allowed her to hone her songwriting talent, which had brought her to Nashville in 1964 as an 18-year-old from the Smoky Mountains.<br />One day, as the Wagoner tour bus headed to the next town, something caught Ms. Parton’s fancy. “We rode past Dover, Tennessee, and my mind started going,” she recalls in “Dolly Parton, Songteller: My Life in Lyrics” (Chronicle, 376 pages, $50). “There was this field of clover waving in the wind. So there we were, Dover-clover, and that started me off: ‘The sun behind a cloud just cast a crawling shadow o’er the fields of clover. And time is running out for me. I wish that he would hurry down from Dover.’ ”<br />The verses that flowed from this roadside epiphany told a story from the point of view of a pregnant girl deserted by her lover and abandoned by her scandalized parents. Alone but still hoping for her lover’s return, she decides to have the baby, which is stillborn. With its Southern Gothic overtones, “Down From Dover” evokes the dark fatalism of the mountain ballads that Ms. Parton heard as a child. Its subject matter was taboo for country radio when it appeared on a 1970 album, so “Dover” was never the hit that she thought it could be. But it remains a favorite of Ms. Parton and many of her fans, and it has enjoyed an afterlife as one of her most covered songs, not only by country singers (Skeeter Davis) but also by campy pop sirens (Nancy Sinatra) and New Wave chanteuses (Marianne Faithfull).<br />“Down From Dover” is one of 175 Parton compositions over a six-decade career featured in “Songteller,” a lavishly illustrated compendium of annotated lyrics and back-story anecdotes. The songs range freely across genres, from classic country weepers to proto-feminist hits like “Just Because I’m a Woman” to frothy upbeat pop crossovers; from stark acoustic bluegrass and movie-soundtrack blockbusters like “9 to 5” and “I Will Always Love You” to Broadway show tunes. It is only a portion of Dolly Parton’s staggering output of 450 recorded songs.</td>

      <td>Louis Kahn (1901-1974) was indisputably one of the greatest architects of the 20th century. When Kahn showed Philip Johnson, the founder of the Museum of Modern Art’s architecture and design department, the drawings for his breakthrough Richards Medical Research Laboratories at the University of Pennsylvania, Johnson responded: “When this building is done you’ll be the most prominent architect in the country and we’ll give it a show at the Museum.”<br />The show opened in 1961 and Kahn, then entering his 60s, was finally launched. Further successes followed quickly. Just a few years after designing the Richards, Kahn became a prisoner of international airport lounges, jetsetting among commissions in India, East and West Pakistan (now Bangladesh and Pakistan), Israel and the United States. He reeled off a string of masterpieces, including the Kimbell Art Museum (Fort Worth, Texas), the Salk Institute (La Jolla, Calif.) and the library at Phillips Exeter Academy (Exeter, N.H.).<br />Kahn’s reputation is unshakable, and yet three recently published books illuminate lingering questions about his life and work. What transformed a standard-issue modernist into a creative force of indomitable originality in his mid-50s? And how should we understand Kahn’s vastly complicated personal life?<br />Furthermore, what about Kahn’s gnomic utterances, of which the best known is “ ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ ” Was Kahn a true sage, as John Lobell argues in “Louis Kahn: Architecture as Philosophy” (Monacelli, 195 pages, $50), or just a bushwa artist conning the eggheads at Yale and Penn, where he taught?<br />Builder; philanderer; philosopher. We are slowly assembling the story of Louis Kahn, the man in full.</td>

      <td>Stalked by killers, a onetime hitman is forced out of retirement.</td>
      <td>Thomas Perry’s gang-world protagonist Michael Schaeffer first appeared in Mr. Perry’s 1982 debut novel, “The Butcher’s Boy,” which told how Schaeffer was adopted at age three by Eddie Mastrewski, a Pittsburgh butcher with a second job as a hired hitman. In his teens, Schaeffer became partners with his surrogate father in both professions. In “Eddie’s Boy” (Mysterious Press, 274 pages, $26), an unanticipated but welcome series entry, Schaeffer is 60, retired and living low-profile in England with his titled wife.<br />Schaeffer’s violent past catches up to him every decade or two, in the form of professional assassins bent on collecting payoffs from retributive mobsters. At the start of “Eddie’s Boy,” Schaeffer is forced to deal with a quartet of thugs who come after him one evening in his wife’s ancestral home. The chillingly focused Schaeffer kills the assailants with a minimum of fuss and an absence of emotion—then apologizes to his wife: “I’m sorry for all the noise and commotion.” His spouse, privy to her husband’s past, responds: “You know, Michael, you’re not thirty anymore. Maybe we could ask some men we trust to help out.” Schaeffer prefers not to involve others. He does take his wife’s suggestion that he lay low in Australia for a while, though he reflects: “They both knew that it was unlikely he’d live to return home one more time.”<br />But Schaeffer was well-trained by his mentor: “Eddie had taught him how to be the one who survived.” Before he can catch his departing flight, however, he feels compelled to kill two men who are shadowing him at the airport. After landing in Sydney, he overpowers another group of attackers on the train into the city. Schaeffer realizes hiding is no longer an option. Who specifically, though, wishes him eliminated? “There were plenty of suspects. . . . He could think of about twenty men.”<br />Few authors write action sequences, build suspense and spring surprises as well as Mr. Perry. And few readers will expect anyone who’s roused Schaeffer’s alarm to escape his fatal attentions. In an attempt to find out who wants him dead, Schaeffer next travels to the U.S., to the Virginia home of Elizabeth Waring, an official in the Justice Department’s Organized Crime Section, with whom he’s had previous dealings. His proposal: If she tells him who’s after him, he’ll give her information on unsolved mob murders she can bring to belated trial.<br />Waring does get some useful facts out of Schaeffer, as she tries to convince him to enter witness-protection and spend the rest of his life testifying against indicted mobsters. But Schaeffer won’t go that far; instead, he engineers ingenious, deadly traps into which he lures his enemies. “It’s not a duel,” Schaeffer says of his current predicament. “It’s more like a hunt. I’m the wolf. . . . No matter how things go, the deer doesn’t get to eat the wolf.”</td>

      <td>A memoir of encounters with literary greats, and the strange labor of the writer’s craft.</td>
      <td>Dana Gioia writes that, by the time he went to college in the early 1970s, he had “already developed a deep suspicion of all theories of art that did not originate in pleasure.” To help build on this sensible foundation, he had the good fortune, during his student days, to encounter some of the leading literary figures of the time. In his final semester as a graduate student at Harvard in 1975, Mr. Gioia was presented with a choice of teachers: Robert Lowell, then at the height of his fame, or Elizabeth Bishop, not well known and often spoken of as a Lowell protégée. Lowell’s seminar on 19th-century poetry was much in demand. “Everyone who fancied himself a poet talked about taking it,” Mr. Gioia writes. As for Bishop’s course on contemporary verse: “I had never heard anyone mention it at all.”<br />The words come from the first of the six short memoirs in this highly enjoyable book. In addition to his classes with Bishop, Mr. Gioia recalls his encounters with John Cheever, whose wit and idiosyncratic wisdom light up each of the 50 or so pages on which he features; Robert Fitzgerald, translator of Homer and Virgil and a fierce defender of metrical forms; the wild-man poet and novelist James Dickey, to whom Mr. Gioia had once given a poor review in an obscure magazine, which turned out to be neither forgotten nor forgiven; and two people unknown in the literary world—an uncle who passed on a love of books to his nephew and a little-published poet, Ronald Perry, whom Mr. Gioia had encouraged during an exchange of letters and who died unexpectedly on the eve of their planned first meeting.<br />To these six must be added the author’s younger self, about whom he writes as engagingly as he writes about anyone else. Mr. Gioia was raised among “a tight enclave of Sicilian relations” in a working-class home in Hawthorne, Calif. None of them read much. He made an early decision to be not only “among the poets,” as Keats put it, but of that minority who have jobs in the larger world—in his case as an executive at General Foods. Mr. Gioia’s achievements are said to include a reversal of the decline in sales of Jell-O. In a brief postscript, he describes his efforts to keep his literary life hidden while he was there. “Whenever something of mine appeared in the New Yorker, I would discreetly buy all five copies in the company shop, mail one to my parents, and slip the others into the bottom of the finance department’s bulging recycling bin.”<br />Elizabeth Bishop’s approach to teaching makes the reader long to be transported back to the mid-1970s, to sit in her class. After all, there was no shortage of places. She began by asking the dozen or so students who were denied the opportunity to study with Lowell to propose “three or four poets they would like to read and talk about. Does anyone have a suggestion?”<br />Someone mentioned John Ashbery, then beginning his ascent to what John Berryman used to refer to as “No. 1.” Bishop brushed the notion aside. “Oh no, we can’t read Ashbery. I wouldn’t know what to say about him.” W.H. Auden was likewise dismissed, on the eccentric grounds that “We just read him in my other class.” The poets she liked talking about most before Mr. Gioia and his fellows were William Carlos Williams and Wallace Stevens (two other poets with day jobs, as it happens: one as a doctor, the other as an insurance executive).</td>

      <td>A word-besotted tale of dictionary-makers, a satire by André Gide and a soul-baring novel about a family’s choice.</td>
      <td>‘What would be in your personal dictionary?” asks a character in Eley Williams’s “The Liar’s Dictionary” (Doubleday, 270 pages, $26.95), and the question will resonate with anyone who has ever felt that language doesn’t sufficiently furnish them with words to match their daily experiences. What Mallory, the novel’s narrator, would like is “a word for knowing when the pasta is perfectly cooked just by looking at it”; “a word for mispronouncing words that you had only ever seen written down”; “a word for being surprised by an aspect of your physicality.” Nothing is more individualized than the act of naming. How maddening that we’re limited to the words that have been deemed appropriate for general usage.<br />In Ms. Williams’s entertaining office-place whodunit, the personalized reference book is no longer just a dream. Mallory is an intern at Swansby’s New Encyclopaedic Dictionary, an erstwhile competitor to the Oxford English Dictionary that has since been forgotten. Swansby’s heir wants all its files digitized for posterity but he faces an awkward problem: The volumes appear to be filled with fake words. Mallory’s impossible task is to find and excise all the fabrications. Meanwhile, alternating chapters set in turn-of-the-century London follow a transformative day in the life of Peter Winceworth, a wallflower researcher who works in the Swansby “Scrivenery.”<br />While bringing the storylines to a convergence, Ms. Williams indulges in delightful digressions. Dictionaries have a rich history with phony words, it happens—known as “mountweazels,” they were included to guard against plagiarists. Mallory discovers that the Swansby’s mountweazels give her some idea of the personality of the rogue lexicographer who snuck them in. (“Mammonsomniate (v.), to dream that money might make anything possible.”) A sense of subjectivity and error begins to creep into the meanings of things. Underneath this novel’s extremely bookish mystery is the idea that our identities are as improvisatory as the words we affix to them, and that even the dictionary, the most seemingly staid and impartial arbiter of truth, is an “unreliable narrator.”<br />In André Gide’s novel “Marshlands” (NYRB, 116 pages, $14.95), the narrator is a writer struggling to write a book called “Marshlands,” about a man living alone in a tower surrounded by swamps whose futile existence expresses the “boredom, vanity, [and] monotony” of the narrator’s life. When not writing his book, the narrator looks for material to add to it—that is, he persists in the desultory routine of pontificating about it to unappreciative friends, establishing a perfectly recursive circle in which life and art reinforce the same “useless contemplation.” The upside, though, is that the narrator gets to feel intellectually superior about his pointlessness. Considering a philistine acquaintance, he grouses that the man “cannot accept that an author, writing not to instruct, may still not be writing to entertain.”<br />Gide published “Marshlands” in 1895 and sporadically revised it and commented upon it throughout his lifetime, as if trying to puzzle out just what he was getting after. That he was writing to entertain there is no doubt, and as a satire of the self-important aesthete the book is witty and frequently hilarious. (The narrator’s meticulously updated daily planner includes items such as “Ten o’clock. Go explain to Magloire why I think he’s such a jerk.”) But is there instruction, as well? In a journal entry decades later, Gide called his narrator an “agitated agitator” whose role is to sow unrest by awakening people to the “sordid apathy” of their existences. It’s true that the wallowing author is only able to complete “Marshlands” once he has succeeded in transferring some of his despair to his longsuffering girlfriend: “Wait! What? Now you’re crying. —Good! I am happy! I act!”</td>

      <td>Makeup sellers like Sephora and Ulta must walk a fine line between stores and e-commerce</td>
      <td>Some things are just a tough sell online. Traditionally, makeup and fragrances have fallen squarely in the category of goods that consumers want to sample in person. Yet even this industry might not be immune to the pandemic’s effects on consumer behavior.<br />Major department stores like  Nordstrom  and  Macy’s  got around a quarter of sales through e-commerce channels in the fiscal year ended Feb. 1. Cosmetics retailer  Ulta Beauty ,  however, derived only 13% of its sales online.<br />Yet e-commerce sales are growing fast at Ulta: by 200% in the quarter ended Aug. 1 compared with a year earlier. Even when stores had fully reopened, online sales were up 90%, hinting at some e-commerce stickiness.<br />This might pose a dilemma for beauty retailers. Push hard on e-commerce and they risk making consumers too comfortable with online shopping, potentially lowering the barrier for online competition and rendering their store fleets obsolete. A similar dynamic has played out with apparel, for example, as newer competitors flooded the market, notes Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.<br />On the surface, Ulta Beauty’s decision to place its shops inside Target stores and Sephora’s plan to set up inside Kohl’s department stores look like bets on traditional bricks-and-mortar. But look more closely and they are also smart hedges against an online future. These setups require less resources than stand-alone stores and also include an online component, as  Target  and  Kohl’s  will be showcasing Ulta Beauty and Sephora products on their websites.</td>

      <td>The country is a rare bright spot for Boeing and Airbus, but its aerospace industry is quickly becoming a geopolitical battleground</td>
      <td>With airlines in the West expecting to take years to recover from Covid-19, aircraft manufacturers depend on the resilience and growth potential of the Chinese market. But China’s own aerospace ambitions and the geopolitical tensions that surround them could make it a turbulent ride.<br />China has recovered from the pandemic to become the world’s largest domestic aviation market. Traffic is 8% higher than a year ago, data by Oliver Wyman’s PlaneStats show. In the U.S. and Europe, it is still down 41% and 68%, respectively.<br />With another 500 million Chinese expected to join the middle classes over the next few years, the country is also the industry’s big growth opportunity. The International Air Transport Association predicts 5% average annual growth in passenger journeys in the Asia-Pacific region between 2019 and 2039. Mature Western markets are expected to expand at a 2.2% rate.<br />Following a mild liberalization of its airline industry in 2004, China has become the second largest source of revenues for the two major plane makers,  Boeing  and  Airbus ,  which have since opened plants there. It is one of their few bright spots too: In November, Boeing downgraded its 20-year global aircraft demand forecast by 2%, but upgraded China’s by 6.3% to 8,600 planes.<br />Relative to the rest of the world, China is especially important for the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families, which are the backbone of low-cost airlines. It has accounted for a quarter of deliveries for the 737 MAX, which Boeing is scrambling to remarket after a 20-month grounding.</td>

      <td>Selected by Celia Paul, author of the memoir ’Self-Portrait.’</td>
      <td>Edited by Ceridwen Lloyd-Morgan (2004)<br />1. The Welsh painter Gwen John had a passionate relationship with the sculptor Auguste Rodin, who was 36 years her senior. Describing the details of the affair to her friend Ursula, she writes: “I had a visit from Rodin yesterday morning and still feel rather faint after it. As you thought, he likes to make me furious, or at least it seems so.” She also wrote about her lover in her notebooks: “Today I woke unwell. I have hurried dreadfully to meet R. He did not come.” The voice of her letters is frank: “I don’t pretend to know anybody well. People are like shadows to me.” Her life was filled with shadows—her melancholy paintings were full of them. Nonetheless, throughout the tempestuous affair with Rodin, and others in her later life, Gwen John remained committed to her art—that is, to the production of paintings of ever greater intensity.<br />By Augustus John (1952)<br />2. Augustus John painted all the most famous people of his time. In his memoir, he describes them with a portraitist’s insight. Oscar Wilde is “an easy-going sort of genius, with an enormous sense of fun, infallible bad taste, gleams of profundity and a romantic apprehension of the Devil.” D.H. Lawrence “made a point of compensating himself for his physical drawbacks by a dazzling display of cerebral fireworks. Originality or Death seemed to be his motto.” Further, John writes, “Amedeo Modigliani was normally a charming man, but he was rarely normal. His habit of chewing hempseed, if it inflamed his imagination, distorted it as well.” Of Gwen John, his sister, we learn, her “apparent timidity and evasiveness disguised a lofty pride. . . . She was capable of a degree of exaltation combined with ruthlessness which, like a pointed pistol, compelled surrender: but the pistol would be pointed at herself.”<br />Edited by Anna Gruetzner Robins (2000)</td>

      <td>The joy of exploring the world on and off the page animates a school story with a hint of Dickensian thrill.</td>
      <td>Gary D. Schmidtdoes something delightful in “Just Like That” (Clarion, 385 pages, $16.99), a novel for readers ages 9-14. He arranges for his characters to discover great books—“Treasure Island,” “Oliver Twist” and “The Wonderful World of Oz” among them—even as he borrows ideas and personality types from great books for the story he is telling about his characters. In this way, Mr. Schmidt’s tale of two young people and their journeys from darkness to light becomes, in itself, a testament to the formative power of literature.<br />“Just Like That” is set in and around 1968, and at first there are two strands to it. The first belongs to Meryl Lee Kowalski, who’s reeling from the accidental death of her best friend and has just arrived for eighth grade at St. Elene’s Preparatory Academy in Maine. Here, in the manner of many a boarding-school tale, she encounters snooty classmates, demanding teachers, and the endless temptation to go out of bounds.<br />The tone is arch and the words often capitalized in Meryl Lee’s part of the story. She imagines that the school’s headmistress, Dr. Nora MacKnockater, exudes Awful Dignity. She and her classmates at St. Elene’s Preparatory Academy, as it is always named, archly and in full, know that it is their mission to develop Resolution, overcome Obstacles and become Accomplished.<br />There’s not much humor in the novel’s second strand, which attaches to Matt Coffin, an illiterate boy more or less Meryl Lee’s age. Enslaved by a gang of pickpockets in New York City for most of his childhood, the traumatized Matt has lately escaped with a bag of loot. When Dr. MacKnockater discovers the boy living in a tumbledown shack near her house, she begins to gentle him, feeding him meatloaf and chowder and Robert Louis Stevenson. But it’s only a matter of time before the homicidal gang boss, a Dickensian villain named Leonidas Shug, tracks him down. Matt knows it, and we know it.<br />The two story-strands come together midway in a scene that captures the book’s dichotomous mood. On Thanksgiving, hearing someone at the door of Dr. MacKnockater’s house, where he’s staying, Matt rushes down wearing only boxers and brandishing a hatchet. He is prepared to kill Leonidas Shug. Instead he finds Meryl Lee, a girl who, like Dorothy in Oz, has embarked on a journey that will take place as much within her as without.</td>

      <td>From the Bauhaus to Black Mountain, the Albers inspired each other—and a generation of artists.</td>
      <td>The 20th century produced its fair share of powerhouse artist couples, among them Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O’Keeffe, Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock, Helen Frankenthaler and Robert Motherwell, and Willem and Elaine de Kooning. But for sheer longevity and high-voltage aesthetic give-and-take, none rivals the union of Josef and Anni Albers, who met at the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany, arrived in the U.S. to teach at Black Mountain College in 1933, and were married for 51 happy and productive years.<br />Numerous books and exhibitions have covered the career of Josef Albers, famed for both his teaching and his rigorous brand of geometric abstraction; fewer have been devoted to the accomplishments of Anni, whose weavings elevated simple craftsmanship to sublime and often monumental statements. No biographer considered the two in tandem until Nicholas Fox Weber published a slim volume about their furniture, textiles and other works in 2004. Now he has written “Anni & Josef Albers: Equal and Unequal”—a mammoth, profusely illustrated doorstopper of a book.<br />Mr. Weber, the author of biographies of Balthus and Le Corbusier, is in an intimate position to present the Alberses as individual artists and married partners—“fiercely ‘independent’ and ‘interdependent’ to rare effect,” as he describes them. He met and became close to the couple in the early 1970s when he was a graduate student at Yale, where Josef was teaching, and since 1979 he has been the head of the foundation that bears the couple’s name.<br />Mr. Weber’s approach in this book is not so much straightforward biography as a smorgasbord of chapters, long and short, detailing the artists’ lives but also examining their relationships with students, collectors, mathematical systems, pre-Columbian art, Duccio and Giotto, Paul Klee and Marcel Breuer (among others), along with the couple’s own tastes in dress, furnishings and even food. With its staggering array of photos and reproductions, this is a book meant to be browsed and savored rather than read straight through.<br />Given their dissimilar backgrounds and an age difference of 11 years, it seems a lucky accident of spontaneous combustion that Anni and Josef should connect at the Bauhaus, that legendary experimental institution for teaching art and design. Josef was the son of a devoutly Catholic painter-decorator in Bottrop, in the northwestern industrial Ruhr region; he worked as an elementary-school teacher before enrolling as a student at the Bauhaus at the age of 32. Anni, born Annelise Elsa Frieda Fleischman, was from a prosperous Jewish family in Berlin; her father “sold expensive dressers and sofas from his vast Art Nouveau showrooms to the swells of Berlin,” Mr. Weber reports, while her uncles “lived in the most impressive mansions in the city [and] all had their clothes custom-made for appearances in the best seats at the opera or for carriage rides from one of their fabulous residences to another.” Anni would soon reject the life of privilege and excess, as she did her artistic education up until that point, whether from her art teacher, a second-generation German Impressionist named Martin Brandenburg, or the instruction she received at the School of Applied Arts, where they taught what she called “sissy stuff, mainly needlepoint.”</td>

Among the 113 people killed were Roger Berlind’s wife, Helen, and three of their four children.<br />Mr. Berlind, the co-founder of a securities firm, suddenly saw no meaning in his Wall Street career. “I wasn’t in any shape to do anything useful at the firm,” he told The Wall Street Journal later, “and I didn’t want to be there.” He quit his job to take care of his toddler son, William.<br />Reverting to his early love of show tunes and theater, he began investing in Broadway productions and soon found himself hooked. Over more than four decades, he had a role in producing more than 100 plays and musicals and won 25 Tony Awards. His hits included “The Book of Mormon,” “Amadeus,” “Nine,” “Sophisticated Ladies” and “City of Angels.”<br />There were also many flops, starting with his first production, in 1976: “Rex,” a Richard Rodgers-Sheldon Harnick musical about Henry VIII. A  New York Times  critic wrote that the production had “almost everything not going for it” and was “one of the most interminable musicals in years.”<br />Mr. Berlind died Dec. 18 of a heart attack in his sleep at his home in Manhattan.

      <td>Have we ever needed a fresher start than the one promised by 2021?<br />As we head into a new year with all its hopes—new year, new you, newly recovered world—there is one thing from the outgoing annus horribilis we should carry forward and even deepen: the spirit of the novice.<br />The pandemic turned us all into beginners. Suddenly, the usual ways of doing things were no longer an option. Governments and businesses scrambled to develop new protocols, and we all struggled to reinvent the activities of everyday life. From queuing to Zoom to mask etiquette, we were faced with an unsettling societal learning curve.<br />Just as noteworthy is how many people, in the face of such disruption, decided that they wanted to learn new things. Online learning sites like Skillshare, Duolingo and Coursera saw extraordinary growth. Enrollments in online art and music classes spiked, while novice bakers flooded the help lines of the Vermont-based flour company King Arthur Baking. Even before “The Queen’s Gambit,” online chess lessons were flourishing. From gardening to camping to bicycling to sewing, people have been taking up new pursuits with abandon.<br />But cultivating new skills and habits is a challenge. Even as we commit to new activities, we struggle to shake off the stasis of familiar routines, especially if we are older. I had this feeling a few years ago when I suddenly realized, shepherding my young daughter to any number of classes and lessons, from swimming to piano, that I couldn’t remember the last new skill I had learned. I had gently ossified into a finished being, coasting along on midcareer competence.</td>

The format drives repeated purchases, especially from young people who want to get their hands on their favorite toys.<br />Xinhua isn’t amused. “Once you enter into the abyss of blind boxes, your wallet will become like a stranger passing on the street,” it said.

Pop Marts’ revenue grew nearly 1,000% from 2017 to 2019 and its blind boxes earned a gross profit margin of 70.5% in the first half of 2020.<br />But scrutiny from state media is rarely a good thing: Pop Mart’s shares have lost 5.6% this week.</td>

It sealed off its borders to battle Covid-19. Most foreign embassies in Pyongyang have closed. North Korea has rebuffed overtures from the U.S. and South Korea to rekindle peace talks.<br />But in the days before the November U.S. elections, North Korea reached out to a European Parliament committee, tasked with handling Korean Peninsula ties, for an online meeting, the people said. The head of the European Parliament delegation, Lukas Mandl, agreed to an informal videoconference conversation with North Korea’s Berlin ambassador.<br />The early December exchange had been suggested by the North’s officials from its Berlin embassy, which after Britain’s planned exit from the European Union in January, has replaced London as the Kim regime’s de facto hub for regional affairs.<br />In the roughly one-hour meeting, the North Korean ambassador repeated a goal of forging a strong relationship with the U.S., so long as Washington’s hostile policy to the Kim regime is dropped, the people said. The stance was received positively, one of the people said, as it didn’t represent a darkening in Pyongyang’s position as President-elect Joe Biden takes office.</td>

That marked a second consecutive decline from the three-month high recorded earlier in December, when virus cases were surging and more jurisdictions were bringing back economic restrictions to control the spread of the coronavirus.<br />Last week’s level remains higher than any recorded before this year, although it is down sharply from a peak of nearly 7 million in late March.<br />Early last week, Congress passed a $900 billion Covid-19 relief bill to, in part, add $300-a-week supplement for those receiving unemployment benefits and extend two pandemic-specific programs used by about 14 million people. But then President Trump said he was displeased with the bill, casting doubt over whether he’d sign it into law. He ultimately did sign the measure on Dec. 27.<br />The higher payments promised in the bill could have motivated some Americans to seek benefits last week, but the lack of clarity about if the bill would become law may have persuaded some would-be applicants to wait. Unemployed workers are not required to file the week they’re laid off and not all applications are approved.</td>
