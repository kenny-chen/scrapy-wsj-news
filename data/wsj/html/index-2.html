      <td>A federal court judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., denied bail for Eduard Florea, a self-proclaimed Proud Boys supporter, and ordered him detained in U.S. custody while he awaits trial on charges that he possessed more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition.<br />U.S. Magistrate Judge Sanket Bulsara said Wednesday that Mr. Florea posed a significant danger to the community and reflected “a premeditated plan to exact violence.”<br />Mr. Florea posted several threatening statements before and during the attack of the U.S. Capitol last week, according to the complaint. These included comments about a U.S. senator-elect and travel plans to Washington, D.C., as part of a group armed with “guns cleaned and loaded.”<br />On Wednesday, Mr. Florea’s defense lawyer, Mia Eisner-Grynberg, urged the court to release him on a bond secured by him, his mother and his wife.<br />“This is not a case where Mr. Florea was found committing an act of violence,” Ms. Eisner-Grynberg said, criticizing the government’s reliance on a series of social-media posts.</td>

      <td>Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey defended the company’s decision to ban President Trump’s personal account, but expressed concern about the risks of companies’ having too much power over public discussion.<br />In a series of tweets late Wednesday, Mr. Dorsey said that the usual check on any one platform’s content regulation is that people can go elsewhere. “This concept was challenged last week when a number of foundational internet-tool providers also decided not to host what they found dangerous,” he wrote. While the actions might be justified in the current moment, he added, “over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet.”<br />Tech companies continue to roll out limits on Mr. Trump’s online options. Snapchat parent Snap Inc., which locked his account indefinitely last week, said Wednesday it would ban him permanently as of Jan. 20 in the interest of public safety and based on his attempts to spread misinformation and hate speech and to incite violence.<br />On Tuesday, YouTube suspended Mr. Trump’s channel. The video-sharing unit of  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google said it was locking the channel for at least seven days after the company removed videos it said violated its policies against content it believes could incite violence.<br />Facebook Inc.  last week suspended Mr. Trump indefinitely—at least through the rest of his term—and Twitter banned him permanently, after pro-Trump rioters invaded the U.S. Capitol and threatened lawmakers. Several other prominent technology companies have also taken steps to limit posts by Mr. Trump and others they feel may be inciting more violence.</td>

But unlike some smaller peers, Chesapeake came into bankruptcy with an exit proposal, supported by top lenders, already in place.<br />After approving the company’s plan during a virtual court hearing, Judge Jones addressed Chesapeake Chief Executive Robert Lawler directly, telling him “to remember that a lot of people have suffered a lot of pain for Chesapeake to have a second chance and I ask that you not forget that going forward.<br />“Chesapeake is a really big and important company. It’s an important company to our country’s infrastructure, it helps make everything work,” Judge Jones said. “But we live right now in a very, very difficult time and you have the ability to be a leader and to make a difference.”</td>

SlideBelts returned the $350,000 loan proceeds in July after multiple requests by the Small Business Administration, which administers the PPP.<br />Under SBA rules, companies under bankruptcy protection aren’t eligible to access the PPP, an enormously popular program of forgivable, government-guaranteed loans designed to keep checks flowing to Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />“The defendants made false statements to multiple banks in order to obtain a [PPP] loan that should have been disbursed to an honest small business suffering financially from the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic,” U.S. attorney McGregor W. Scott said Tuesday. The Justice Department and the SBA will “aggressively pursue those who exploit federal programs intended to help those in need during this national emergency,” he said.<br />As part of the settlement, SlideBelts and Mr. Taylor, who is also the company’s chief financial officer, admitted to making false statements to the three different banks where they submitted PPP applications, prosecutors said.</td>

      <td>Federal regulators are asking  Tesla Inc.  to recall about 158,000 vehicles over safety concerns in what would amount to one of the biggest safety actions by the electric-vehicle maker.<br />The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked Tesla in a Jan. 13 letter to recall some Model S luxury sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles. NHTSA asked for the recall because the cars’ touch screens can fail after a few years of use, affecting safety functions on the vehicles like defogging and back-up cameras.<br />Some car recalls run into millions of vehicles. Though modest by historic numbers, the action would represent a relatively large recall for Tesla, which has far fewer cars on the road than some rivals. The Silicon Valley car maker delivered nearly 500,000 vehicles globally last year.<br />Tesla doesn’t have to recall the vehicles, though NHTSA said in the letter that if the car maker doesn’t take the action it has to provide an explanation for its decision. The agency can then escalate the matter to a public hearing and eventually seek to force a recall through the courts.<br />Tesla in 2018 recalled 123,000 Model S cars over a finding that cold weather could corrode some bolts, potentially leading to power-steering failures.</td>

      <td>The best outcome now is to make the House vote the end with no Senate trial.</td>
      <td>Democrats rushed through their second impeachment of President Trump on Wednesday, with less than a week left before he exits the Oval Office. The exercise is mostly about making a political statement since it will have no other practical effect, though it might stir up more public anger and discord.<br />We’re on record as saying Mr. Trump committed an impeachable offense in inciting supporters to march on Congress with a goal of overturning the election as the electoral votes were counted. He may not have directly incited violence, but he still promoted an assault on the democratic transfer of power.<br />Mr. Trump was so self-deluded that he seems to believe this was possible, and he encouraged his supporters to believe it too. Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell resisted at a crucial moment and saved the day.<br />Mr. Trump will soon be gone, Joe Biden will take power, yet Democrats are still preoccupied with Donald Trump. On Tuesday they issued an ultimatum to Mr. Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and depose Mr. Trump or they’d impeach. Mr. Pence rightly refused and on proper grounds: the 25th Amendment was meant for a President who is incapacitated. Only a single Republican voted for the gambit.<br />Then Wednesday Democrats sprinted to the floor to impeach: No hearings, no fact-finding, no chance for defense. To what end? One goal seems to be simply to tag him as the only President impeached twice and to declare that Mr. Trump’s actions are unacceptable. In that case the House vote should be enough. Everyone voted his conscience, and that should be the end of it.</td>

      <td>With Donald Trump in his final presidential days, the hardest job in the world may be White House counsel. So here’s a note of thanks for Pat Cipollone, who is staying on the job when the easier route would be to resign to outside applause.<br />No one can predict what Mr. Trump will do in the next week, and he often ignores the advice of his lawyers while heeding the horrendous counsel of opportunists like Rudy Giuliani. Case in point: Mr. Trump’s apparent belief that Vice President Mike Pence could overturn the state Electoral College votes on Jan. 6.<br />Mr. Trump could continue to make bad decisions, such as pardoning himself as he leaves office. That would increase the odds that the Biden Justice Department would look for some charge to make against Mr. Trump to challenge the pardon in court. The case might travel up to the Supreme Court, which could put new limits on the capacious language of the Pardon Clause in the Constitution.<br />Mr. Trump did one good deed Wednesday in finally issuing a clear statement calling for no violent protests: “In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind. That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers.” Mr. Trump should say this again from the Oval Office, but whoever encouraged that statement did a public service.<br />Every official has to search his conscience amid Mr. Trump’s actions, and outside moral judgment is easy and often wrong. Many good people are trying to prevent more bad decisions.</td>

The Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit that investigates technology platforms, obtained the subpoena through an open records request and shared it with The Wall Street Journal.<br />Amazon declined to comment.

      <td>How trust busters botched the Staples-Office Depot merger.</td>
      <td>Five years ago the Federal Trade Commission broke up the Staples- Office Depot  merger attempt. Its dubious complaint is worth revisiting now as Staples tries again to get hitched to Office Depot to compete with  Amazon .<br />Staples’s private-equity owner Sycamore Partners this week proposed to buy Office Depot for $2.1 billion—a song compared to the $6.3 billion deal the FTC killed. The FTC had complained the merger would effectively create an office-supply monopoly, narrowly defining the competitive market as large corporate contracts.<br />Amazon, the government argued, was merely a bit supplier to big businesses and its higher costs couldn’t possibly allow it to compete. Lol. As we argued at the time (“Protecting Big Business”), the FTC’s job is to protect consumers, not corporations. In any case Office Depot and Staples still faced plenty of competition from  Costco ,  Amazon and  Walmart .<br />Federal judge Emmet Sullivan agreed with the FTC and enjoined the merger. Sycamore then took Staples private. Both office-supply retailers have since closed hundreds of stores as more businesses and consumers have bought office supplies online. As more documents go digital, people need less ink, file folders, Post-it Notes, etc.<br />Their corporate business has also been gobbled by Amazon, which advertises that it serves 55 of the top Fortune 100 companies. Because of its scale, Amazon can charge lower prices. Hence Sycamore is now trying to rekindle the merger.</td>

We’ve seen a copy of the 12-page document, and it reads like a hostage plea.<br />“To help establish a shared vision on U.S. climate policy, the financial services industry seeks to engage with incoming administration leaders and members of Congress on a bipartisan basis,” IIF says. “By so doing, we hope to inform the policymaking process and demonstrate our willingness and capacity to support a common-sense transition to a more sustainable, and inclusive, low-carbon economy.” At your climate service, sirs.<br />IIF notes that “the financial services industry has been active on climate priorities for decades, helping to build an analytical, market-based foundation for quantifying, reporting and managing climate risks, and supporting new opportunities.”<br />IIF calls for a “common approach” to corporate sustainability disclosures that have been developed by outfits such as the Global Reporting Initiative, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (Sasb). Michael Bloomberg has bankrolled the latter two, and we’ve written about Sasb’s political standards.</td>

At the start of each year, it brings together its full investment team to actively debate which industries and subsectors of those industries they believe will yield the most attractive investment opportunities in the coming year and how they might evolve over the long term.<br />The exercise allows the firm to better respond to industry or economic shifts and move away from subsectors if they become less attractive, according to New Mountain founder and Chief Executive Steven Klinsky.</td>

      <td>He’s wrong to skip the inauguration, but he can still discourage any further violence.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump won’t be the first president to skip his successor’s inauguration.<br />The original boycotter was John Adams. After a vicious campaign, Adams left Washington at 4 a.m. on Inauguration Day, March 4, 1801, on the first stagecoach home to Massachusetts. Eight hours later, blue-coated militiamen snapped to attention and an artillery company fired a round as Thomas Jefferson emerged from his boarding house at New Jersey Avenue and C Street. The U.S. marshal for Maryland then walked Jefferson, members of Congress, foreign diplomats and local residents several hundred yards north to the Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony.<br />John Quincy Adams made inaugural absences a family tradition. In March 1829, he departed the White House the day before Andrew Jackson’s swearing-in. Like the 1800 election, the 1828 campaign was particularly nasty.<br />There are similarities between Mr. Trump and Andrew Johnson, the last president who refused to participate in marking the peaceful transfer of power. Though both were elected as Republicans, neither Mr. Trump nor Johnson, Abraham Lincoln’s running mate in 1864, was a longtime party member. Johnson was a Southern Democrat who opposed secession. Mr. Trump was a celebrity real-estate tycoon who had supported Republicans and Democrats.<br />Both Mr. Trump and Johnson had been impeached and acquitted. Mr. Trump faced charges of Russian collusion while Johnson was accused of violating the Tenure of Office Act, which required congressional approval to remove a cabinet member. Both impeachments were motivated largely by other factors: Democratic anger that Mr. Trump was elected, and Mr. Johnson’s opposition to congressional Republicans’ move to impose on the defeated South state governments dominated by men loyal to the union and black suffrage.</td>

      <td>A blockbuster NBA deal unites Harden with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on a Nets team that could win a title—if they can learn to coexist</td>
      <td>James Harden, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving now play for the same NBA team. What could go wrong?<br />The Brooklyn Nets made the biggest trade of the NBA season on Wednesday and created a team of temperamental superstars by dealing for Harden, the Houston Rockets’ virtuosic scorer and the league’s former Most Valuable Player, and making him the latest bearded millennial seeking reinvention by moving to Brooklyn.<br />But uniting Harden with Durant and Irving to declare themselves title contenders is also incredibly risky now and could be even costlier in the future. The haul of draft equity heading to the Rockets reportedly includes Brooklyn’s unprotected first-round draft picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026, when Harden, Durant and Irving are no longer under contract, and the right to swap picks with the Nets in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027.<br />But wait. There’s more. Houston is also getting Victor Oladipo from the Indiana Pacers and another first-round pick in 2022 after expanding the deal to send Caris LeVert from the Nets to the Indiana Pacers and Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince to the Cleveland Cavaliers.<br />The dizzying trade during an especially chaotic week in the NBA involves four teams, four draft picks, four pick swaps and at least four intriguing players—and one huge bet from the Nets.</td>

      <td>Agencies are using the technology to identify the Capitol rioters.</td>
      <td>Federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies are using facial-recognition technology to identify the members of the mob that assaulted the U.S. Capitol last week.<br />Elsewhere, facial recognition and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used for nefarious purposes—including by China to persecute minorities and to identify Hong Kong dissidents.<br />We represent Clearview AI, the U.S. facial-recognition startup that became controversial a year ago when its existence came to light in the media. Clearview AI maintains a database of billions of publicly posted photographs that have been lawfully downloaded from the Internet, where users posted them on public websites, including social media. Clearview AI downloads photographs from the public internet that are available to any user from any computer around the world without the consent of the person photographed.<br />Licensed clients of Clearview AI—which are limited to law-enforcement agencies—can run a photo of an unidentified person through Clearview AI’s database for after-the-crime investigations. Clearview AI uses algorithms to create facial vectors, or “faceprints,” of the photo’s subject.<br />The question for policy makers is how to regulate this technology to allow its legitimate use and prevent abuse. A patchwork of state and local laws seek to restrict or even prohibit the use of biometrics, including faceprints. These are of dubious constitutionality, since the Supreme Court has made plain that “the creation and dissemination of information are speech within the meaning of the First Amendment.”</td>

      <td>For people who can control their impulses and regulate their emotions—so it is argued—the use of drugs, including heroin, can have good effects.</td>
      <td>In a referendum in November, Oregon became the first state to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and LSD. The move was inspired by a 2001 law in Portugal that removed incarceration as a penalty for drug possession. To judge by “Drug Use for Grown-Ups,” Carl Hart welcomed this news, which came too late for him to mention in his provocative and enlightening book. He opens with the announcement: “I am an unapologetic drug user.”<br />Mr. Hart, a professor of psychology and a neuroscientist at Columbia University, asserts that “recreational drugs can be used safely to enhance many vital human activities.” He bases his claim on decades of research on the behavioral and physiological effects of drugs in humans, coupled with his personal use. Thanks to drugs, he says, “I am a happier and better person.” He asks that we think about drugs in a more nuanced way, even at a time when opioid abuse is still headline news. Thus his book represents a calculated risk—namely, that by portraying drug use as so potentially rewarding for responsible users, it may inadvertently seduce non-grown-ups into hazardous use.<br />Mr. Hart reports that his views about drugs have evolved over the years. Growing up near Miami as a teen in the early 1980s, a city then overrun with crack cocaine, he saw drugs as a raging menace. In graduate school he began studying neuroscience. “If I could stop people from taking drugs, especially by fixing their broken brains,” he told himself, “I could fix the poverty and crime in my community.” In pursuit of this mission, he tried to prove the dangers of drug use. But over time he concluded that the marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine that he gave (with the approval of various ethics committees) to his subjects, themselves experienced drug users, was not as harmful as he had expected. No matter the drug, his subjects overwhelmingly said that they felt “more altruistic, empathetic, euphoric, focused, grateful, and tranquil.”<br />“Drug Use for Grown-Ups” has the soul of a manifesto. Mr. Hart wants to show us that “government bans on recreational drugs violate the spirit and promise of the nation’s founding document.” Putting it more personally, he writes: “It is my birthright to use substances in my pursuit of happiness.” Though a regular user of heroin, Mr. Hart says that he is “not an addict,” adding: “I have never failed to meet my obligations as a result of the drug or its effects.” The same is true for most other heroin users, he says, citing data showing that addiction affects only 10% to 30% of those who regularly use heroin and methamphetamine, among other drugs.<br />The alleged enslaving nature of drugs—you use it and you’re hooked—is one of many misperceptions that Mr. Hart tries to dispel. Each of his chapters presents a tutorial on the pharmacology and physiological effects of a particular class of drug, including opioids, amphetamines, psychedelics, cocaine and cannabis.</td>

      <td>Alphabet has no legal obligation to recognize or negotiate with the well-funded pressure group.</td>
      <td>The “union” formed by workers last week at Google parent company Alphabet isn’t really a labor union in the traditional sense. Rather it’s a pressure group funded by the Communications Workers of America, which will provide staff and support to generate negative publicity about management at the Mountain View, Calif., company. The so-called Alphabet Workers Union is composed of fewer than 800 workers among Alphabet’s roughly 250,000 employees and contractors, some of whom are technically employed by completely separate entities, some of which are already unionized.<br />The AWU describes itself as a “minority” or “members only” union, but such things are unlawful under federal labor law. Alphabet has no obligation to meet with, recognize or afford the AWU—or the CWA—any special rights. The group has no legal authority to bargain with Alphabet, and there is no reason the company should do so.<br />A real union has a democratic mandate, with a majority of employees voting to designate it their exclusive representative to bargain with their employer. Real unions represent a group of employees, with a true community of interest, bound by job location and classification and with legal standing to negotiate for better wages and working conditions.<br />The union movement in the U.S. arose to address workplace concerns far more pressing than the ones faced by Alphabet employees. For highly paid white-collar tech employees to co-opt the union label—while other workers still fight for safe workplaces, livable wages and essential benefits—is an insult to the American labor movement.<br />It is hardly surprising that the tech industry has shown little interest in a unionized workforce. Most tech workers are highly skilled and enjoy generous pay and benefits. The dangerous conditions and unfair work practices that unions were created to combat simply don’t exist in an environment where the average employee makes more than $250,000 and receives Cadillac health-care, tuition reimbursement and other benefits—including free food.</td>

But the events of a recent evening give me hope we’re both turning a corner.<br />On the night in question, Devin was dragooned into helping our son Finn, a sixth-grader, with his math homework. Based on what I overheard while passing the kitchen table, fractions were involved. Finn was struggling with a concept, and Devin was offering assistance that, while loving, was of dubious value.<br />“All you need to do is cross-multiply,” Devin instructed.</td>

      <td>Some rioters’ lawyers approach prosecutors in bid to avoid charges as FBI warns other agencies that partisan grievances are expected to fuel further violence</td>
      <td>Several members of the pro-Trump mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol last week have reported their own involvement to law enforcement this week, officials said Wednesday, as prosecutors race to charge dozens of the most visible participants in the attack and continue to dig into what kind of planning went into it.<br />Lawyers for several of the rioters have called law enforcement to disclose information about their clients’ participation in the breach in an effort to avoid more serious criminal charges and potentially negotiate plea deals, law-enforcement officials said.<br />In dozens of cases filed since the deadly riot, prosecutors have targeted some of the most visible participants whose efforts were broadcast widely on social media. They announced the arrest Wednesday of a Virginia man who was photographed on the scene wearing a sweatshirt bearing the words Camp Auschwitz. Among others arrested was a man from Idaho who was identified from photos showing him hanging by one hand from the Senate balcony.<br />The two men are charged with violent entry or disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, among other counts. The affidavit filed in support of the arrest of 56-year-old Robert Packer cites media reports that identified him as the man photographed in the sweatshirt referring to the Nazi concentration camp, and says an informant contacted law enforcement after recognizing him as a routine customer at a store in Newport News, Va. An attorney for Mr. Packer couldn’t be identified for comment.<br />The new cases come as Washington and cities across the country brace for the possibility of more armed protests and violence in the days before Joe Biden’s inauguration. Biden officials said Wednesday that the president-elect received a briefing from Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Secret Service officials to learn more about the threat picture and what plans are being assembled to thwart potential attacks.</td>

On Instagram, the company’s popular photo-sharing platform, views skyrocketed for content from authors in “zero trust” countries, reflecting potential efforts at platform manipulation by entities overseas.<br />Facebook’s platforms were aflame, the documents show. One Instagram presentation, circulated internally and seen by the Journal, was subtitled “Why business as usual isn’t working.”<br />Company leaders feared a feedback loop, according to people familiar with the matter, in which the incendiary events in Washington riled up already on-edge social-media users—potentially leading to more strife in real life.<br />Facebook ultimately decided on a series of actions over the past week that, taken together, amount to its most aggressive interventions against President Trump and his supporters. And they show the company continuing to grapple with how best to police its platforms while still allowing for political discussion.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—As the House weighed removing President Trump from office for last week’s violent riot, a small army was on hand to make sure another attack didn’t happen.<br />Hundreds of National Guard troops and police officers were stationed throughout Capitol Hill Wednesday, a week after a mob of the president’s supporters overwhelmed police, ransacked the building and left five dead. Some troops rested by statues of American icons inside the Capitol, laying their assault-style weapons beside them on the marble floors. Others stockpiled riot shields and gas masks. Five-ton armored trucks cut off traffic in the surrounding neighborhood.<br />Already largely void of visitors and staff because of the coronavirus pandemic, the halls of American democracy were transformed into a military zone, with many lawmakers and staff on Capitol Hill still reeling from last week’s violence.<br />Much of the physical damage from the attack, when rioters forced lawmakers to delay the ratification of Joe Biden’s election victory, had been repaired by Wednesday. Glass was replaced on the door near the House chamber where a Capitol Police officer shot one of the rioters, who later died, and broken furniture and debris were swept away.<br />But for lawmakers, many of whom police rushed to secure locations during the attack, the events of last week were still raw. Democrats moved rapidly to bring the article of impeachment to the floor, winning the support of 10 House Republicans, and law-enforcement officials are bracing for more potential violence in Washington and in state capitals.</td>

      <td>Moynihan Train Hall, the expansion of Penn Station to the Beaux-Arts James A. Farley building, imbues boarding Amtrak and commuter lines with some grandeur.</td>
      <td>New York<br />There is a certain class of buildings that only the public should judge. When it comes to a great urban train station, for instance, the opinion of the critic scarcely matters. Is it spacious and bright enough? Do its paths of movement make sense, are they instantly legible? Does it treat its passengers with basic human courtesy, or as livestock to be driven along into their pens? The passenger alone can tell. And so to assess New York’s Moynihan Train Hall, which opened on New Year’s Day, I traveled there as an Amtrak passenger, having deliberately read nothing about it in advance. I wanted to be surprised.<br />The new $1.6 billion train hall is housed in the former main post office, on Eighth Avenue, just to the west of Penn Station. It is a fluke that a building was there to absorb the station’s excess capacity; buildings, unlike opera singers, do not usually have stand-ins waiting in the wings. But it was once the practice to build major train stations and post offices in tandem, the same tracks carrying both passengers and mail. New York paired Penn Station (1910) with the James A. Farley Post Office (1913/1934), both by McKim, Mead & White, America’s most gifted classical architects. The buildings were elevated directly above the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad, whose tunnel under the Hudson River made the complex possible.<br />The original Penn Station was demolished in 1964, right down to its train platforms, and in its place was built Madison Square Garden. The decapitated station below delivered a thoroughly nasty travel experience, not only for passengers on Amtrak (which replaced the bankrupt Penn Central) but also for those on the Long Island Rail Road and NJ Transit. Departing passengers stood shoulder to shoulder in their shapeless corral, watching the big timetable perform its coy fan dance of delay upon delay, until the announcement of the track launched the frenzied crush toward an escalator wide enough for one. Having experienced it once, you never forgot it—like the running of the bulls in Pamplona, but in a cellar and with less dignity.<br />Depending where you exit your train, you can still emerge inside Penn Station, which will continue to remain in operation. There I found myself last week and began searching for the passage to the Moynihan Train Hall. As it happens, there is none; trains can move in a straight line between the two buildings but you cannot. It takes some time to find the meek arrow that sends you outside, where you must make your way across Eighth Avenue. In fact, one can get there without going outside, by negotiating the concourse of the Long Island Rail Road, although the path is so labyrinthine that you are as likely to find the Minotaur as Moynihan Hall.</td>

This year’s iteration, restricted to digital content due to the Covid-19 pandemic, has, paradoxically, gone even further than usual. The festival’s six presentations headily push boundaries in media, composition, content and geography. They are also available to a much wider public than Prototype’s small theaters can normally hold, and all but one (“Modulation,” which costs $25) are free of charge.<br />For “Modulation,” the 2021 festival’s world-premiere commission, 13 composers—seven of them women, almost all of them people of color—created a series of short films, accessed through an interactive website. On the home page, vocalist Carmina Escobar’s breath-centered music invites the user to select among three lighted doors; these lead to new pages, each a collection of films about “Identity,” “Fear” or “Isolation,” all themes germane to the current moment.<br />The pieces are as diverse as their creators, and they communicate their personal and political messages with clarity and verve. In “Identity,” Juhi Bansal’s “Waves of Change” juxtaposes melismatic singing in Bengali, a cello solo, and footage of a woman on a surfboard to evoke a sense of boundless freedom. Another “Identity” piece, Paul Pinto’s “Whiteness: Blanc,” uses snappy spoken text and the exponentially multiplied image of the artist’s brown face for a seriocomic exploration of the answer to the question “Where are you from?” “Fear” includes Yvette Janine Jackson’s “Fear Is Their Alibi,” in which a soprano sings a slow blues to an ominous bassoon accompaniment as an animated black line becomes a house, a hand, and a boot that viciously crushes the rest of the line into a helpless black puddle.</td>

      <td>Investors who bet that shares of  GameStop Corp.  would fall shifted positions Wednesday, sending the struggling videogame retailer’s stock soaring to its highest levels in years.<br />GameStop shares were up more than 57% to $31.40 on Wednesday, marking a steep climb from a year earlier, when the stock was valued at just $4.61 a share.<br />That recovery—fueled in part by the company’s announcement two days ago that it would add Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen and two of his former colleagues to its board—created a so-called short squeeze that drove share prices sharply higher, according to some analysts. A short squeeze occurs when traders respond to an increase in price for a stock they bet would drop by purchasing shares in order to avoid losses.<br />Many traders believed GameStop’s shares were set to decline. As of the end of last year, short interest in the stock—expressed as a percentage of GameStop shares available for trading—exceeded 138%, making it the second-most shorted company by that metric with a market value of at least $1 billion, according to data from FactSet.<br />It is fairly rare that short interest would exceed shares available to trade on the public markets, said James Angel, a Georgetown University professor who studies financial markets. Such positions can build up because traders are able to borrow shares from other investors, and those shares can be loaned more than once, according to Dr. Angel.</td>

      <td>The Latin name for a marauding ancient Germanic tribe made its way into the new article of impeachment against Donald Trump</td>
      <td>The article of impeachment introduced against President Trump accuses him of inciting a crowd that “unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol,” among other “violent, deadly, destructive and seditious acts.” As the Journal has reported, the pro-Trump rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 vandalized statues and other historic artwork housed there.<br />Even before last week’s riot, politically motivated vandalism was in the news. When Congress adjourned its 2020 session without passing a bill approving $2,000 stimulus checks, the homes of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were both vandalized with spray paint.<br />“Vandalize” and “vandalism” are formed from “vandal,” for someone who willfully or maliciously damages property. The words memorialize historic acts of destruction from a millennium and a half ago that went far beyond defacing statues or spray-painting graffiti.<br />The original vandals were a Germanic people who sacked Rome in 455 AD, after overrunning Gaul, Spain and northern Africa. The Latin name for the tribe was the “Vandali,” plural of “Vandalus.” That was simply the Roman version of the name used by tribal members themselves in an early Germanic language. Etymologists think the name may go back to a Proto-Germanic root, “wandljaz,” meaning “wanderer.”<br />Because the Vandals were associated with plundering Roman civilization, the word was transferred to someone who disregards or damages items of historical or cultural significance, or someone who acts in a barbaric fashion.</td>

The shares closed at $97.24.<br />The enthusiastic reception for Affirm shares could indicate that 2021 will be similar to 2020.

      <td>VMware chief Pat Gelsinger named as successor  after hedge fund Third Point called for sweeping change at the semiconductor giant</td>
      <td>Intel Corp.  ousted its chief executive in a surprise move that pivots the semiconductor giant closer to its engineering roots after a period of technology missteps, market-share losses and pressure from a hedge fund.<br />Intel on Wednesday said CEO Bob Swan would be succeeded by  VMware Inc.  chief Pat Gelsinger effective Feb. 15. Mr. Gelsinger, who was once Intel’s technology chief, has served as CEO of the business-software provider since 2012.<br />The leadership transition unfolds after Intel last year ceded the title as America’s most valuable semiconductor company to rival  Nvidia Corp.  and fell further behind rivals in churning out the most advanced chips. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is also considering a broader embrace of third-party chip makers rather than relying on its own factories.<br />“This is incredibly important strategically to what Intel is looking to accomplish and be defined more as a technology innovator and operator,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group, a wealth-management firm that owns a stake in Intel through one of its funds.<br />Mr. Swan joined Intel in 2016 as chief financial officer. He was named interim CEO two years later and formally given the top job in January 2019.</td>

      <td>Citigroup Inc.  is restructuring its businesses that manage money for wealthy customers, one of the first big moves by incoming chief executiveJane Fraser to put her stamp on the bank.<br />The New York bank is combining into a new unit its high-end private bank for the ultrarich and its wealth-management offerings for the less affluent, Ms. Fraser and outgoing CEO Michael Corbat said in a memo to employees Wednesday.<br />Until now,  Citigroup ’s  private bank—which serves clients with more than $25 million in assets—was run by the bank’s institutional clients group. The consumer wealth operations, including the CitiGold brand, were managed by the retail bank. Those offerings, which require a minimum balance of $50,000 in  Citigroup  accounts, generally served customers with as much as $10 million in assets.<br />By creating a unified Citi Global Wealth business, the bank’s executives are trying to serve customers along the entire spectrum. The idea is for the bank to get clients earlier and keep them as they grow richer, earning more fees in the process.<br />The combination bears the fingerprints of Ms. Fraser, who will take over when Mr. Corbat retires next month. Finding ways for the two parts of  Citigroup ,  its institutional and consumer businesses, to work more closely together is expected to be near the top of her agenda as CEO.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Supreme Court justices voiced mixed views Wednesday about whether a U.S. consumer-protection agency has broad authority to demand that defendants who cheat or deceive the public must return the money they gain from that activity.<br />Justices across the ideological spectrum acknowledged that the Federal Trade Commission for decades has been going to court to seek financial redress from companies and individuals who allegedly engage in scams and unfair business practices. And until recent years, lower courts had uniformly ruled that the FTC had the power to do so.<br />But many of the same justices also suggested the text of the relevant 1973 law, which gives the FTC the right to seek court injunctions against nefarious activity, doesn’t explicitly give it the right to seek financial judgments as well.<br />“If it is a mistake, it has been around for 50 years,” said Justice Stephen Breyer, adding that courts sometimes have to let “bygones be bygones.”<br />But Justice Breyer also said the FTC in recent years had been seeking to recover money in cases that weren’t necessarily egregious, which raised concerns about fairness to the business community.</td>

      <td>Chip maker’s manufacturing slip will take years to repair in a fast-moving market</td>
      <td>Intel Corp.  has returned to form with its new boss. But in many other ways, there may be no going back for the storied chip maker.<br />Intel announced Wednesday that Pat Gelsinger will take over the chief executive’s reins from Bob Swan, who’s effectively held the position for just two and a half years. That’s the shortest run of any Intel chief—about half the time of his immediate predecessor who was booted from the company following the discovery of an affair with a subordinate. Mr. Swan’s tenure was marked less by scandal and more by the other major problem he inherited—the loss of Intel’s position as the world’s most advanced chip manufacturer.<br />As an engineer with a 30-year stint at Intel under his belt, Mr. Gelsinger might seem more suited to addressing this problem. And his most recent job running VMware has made him a highly regarded leader in Silicon Valley. Intel’s share price jumped 7% Wednesday on the news, while VMware’s stock slipped by the same amount.<br />But Mr. Gelsinger is inheriting problems that have no quick fix. Intel’s struggles with advancing its chip-making process began before Mr. Swan came on board—and they have deepened since. The company disclosed in July that its latest process for manufacturing chips at 7 nanometers ran into new problems that would delay mass production on that process to late 2022. Rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC, is already making more advanced chips at 5 nanometers.<br />Being two generations behind a fast-moving rival has forced Intel to consider the rather unorthodox option of outsourcing the production of some of its most advanced chips to TSMC. That could help Intel close the manufacturing gap that has let  Advanced Micro Devices —another TSMC customer—pick up share in the PC and data center markets. But it would be a significant shift for a company that has long based its competitive advantage on being an integrated manufacturer.</td>

The moves came after Mr. Floyd, a Black man, was killed by police in May, inciting a national debate about systemic racism.<br />At the time, the companies said the money they pledged would go toward boosting the net worth of Black families, creating professional opportunities for minorities and diversifying their own ranks, among other outcomes.</td>

The new ban could have a significant impact especially in the apparel sector, which has already faced a number of customs restrictions amid concern about forced labor linked to the camps.<br />Beijing has denied such allegations and calls the camps vocational training centers.

      <td>We’re done with avoiding it. Indeed, we’re saving it, rendering it and using it to make all kinds of dishes more delicious.</td>
      <td>THERE’S NO fat-shaming in butchery. What some might consider a scrap is actually a kitchen asset.<br />As the cooking credo goes: Fat equals flavor. Science even proves it. “There is a growing body of research that supports fat as a sixth primary taste,” said Nik Sharma, author of “The Flavor Equation: The Science of Great Cooking Explained.” Mr. Sharma ranks what scientists are calling oleogustus—fattiness/richness—right up there with the sweet, sour, salty, bitter and savory experiences that make eating pleasurable. “Fat makes food taste delicious,” he simply explained.<br />Meat-eaters can go beyond the bottles of oil and butters on hand in their kitchens by rendering out the flavorful fat from scraps they’ve trimmed away from cuts of meat. “It is really cost-effective. You get the most out of what you are paying for,” said Aaron Rocchino, butcher/proprietor of the Local Butcher Shop in Berkeley, Calif. Mr. Rocchino encourages saving fat from pork, beef and poultry. Once you amass enough, you can render it by cooking slowly until the fat melts and separates from the meaty matter it’s attached to, leaving a flavorful liquid medium for all kinds of cooking.<br />A chef as well as a butcher, Mr. Rocchino worked in such esteemed kitchens as Le Bernardin in New York and Chez Panisse in Berkeley, where he honed his whole-animal butchering skills. Over the years he forged relationships with livestock farmers that eventually propelled him to his own butcher shop. The Local Butcher Shop opened in 2011 with the mission of providing restaurant-quality meat to retail customers while using as much of the animal as possible—fat and all. Beyond prime meat cuts, the shop carries everything from stock to dog food to those delicious rendered fats.<br />Whether poultry schmaltz, pork lard or beef tallow, rendered fat can take a dish from good to glorious. “Choosing the right fat is key, as different fats have different flavors and different smoking points too,” Mr. Rocchino said. Rule of thumb: The smaller the animal, the milder the flavor; the larger the animal, the stronger the flavor. Chicken, duck and goose schmaltz add a gentle richness without overpowering. They also don’t have a high smoking point, so it’s best to use schmaltz for binding matzo balls, as an enhancement to a pot of rice or a medium for slow-roasting vegetables. (Potatoes roasted in duck or goose fat = bliss.)</td>

The earlier filing showed Mr. Karfunkel and his wife on July 29 donated a significantly larger sum—three million Kodak shares—to Congregation Chemdas Yisroel in Brooklyn, N.Y., a charity Mr. Karfunkel helped found. That donation left the couple with about 3.3 million shares, the filing said.<br />Mr. Karfunkel and officials of the charity didn’t respond to requests for comment. A Kodak spokesman said the company doesn’t comment on financial transactions of board members.<br />The original donation occurred at a turbulent time for Kodak’s stock. On July 29, Kodak’s stock sharply surged and closed at its highest level since 2014. The Rochester, N.Y., company and a federal agency had just announced the onetime photography giant was in line to receive a $765 million loan from the White House to help manufacture drugs for the fight against coronavirus.<br />U.S. International Development Finance Corp. subsequently put the loan on hold after the deal came under congressional and regulatory scrutiny.</td>

      <td>Central bank’s business contacts downgrade characterization of economic activity following surge in Covid-19 cases</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. economy grew “modestly” in the final weeks of 2020, as a resurgence in Covid-19 cases prompted activity in some sectors to slow, a Federal Reserve report said Wednesday.<br />The Fed’s periodic compilation of anecdotes from business contacts, known as the Beige Book, provided the latest evidence that the pandemic dealt a setback to the economic recovery in recent months. Soaring infection rates and efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 also contributed to the U.S. labor market’s loss of 140,000 jobs in December, the first employment decline since the pandemic struck last spring, the Labor Department said Friday.<br />“Although the prospect of Covid-19 vaccines has bolstered business optimism for 2021 growth, this has been tempered by concern over the recent virus resurgence and the implications for near-term business conditions,” the central bank said Wednesday. The report said most Fed districts reported that economic activity increased modestly since the previous reporting period, but noted “conditions remained varied.”<br />Two of the Fed’s 12 districts reported no growth in recent weeks, while two others reported declines in activity.<br />The Fed’s characterization of economic conditions represented a downgrade from its previous Beige Book report, released Dec. 2, when policy makers described economic growth as “modest or moderate.” At that time, business contacts signaled the possibility of a potential slowdown given the surge in Covid-19 infections that was under way.</td>

John McCain, the latest sign of infighting in the state party.<br />The resolutions, which if passed would express disapproval but have no formal consequences, come as the state GOP is distancing itself from many of the Republican Party’s longtime establishment figures. The three censure resolutions easily passed the party’s resolution committee and will be brought before the entire state committee on Jan. 23.<br />The proposed censures for each person refer to what some party members say is executive overreach by Mr. Ducey in his response to the pandemic, Mrs. McCain’s support for same-sex marriage, and Mrs. McCain’s and Mr. Flake’s endorsements of President-elect Joe Biden in the 2020 election, among other things.<br />In a statement, Mrs. McCain criticized Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward and denounced what she described as continuous insults and personal attacks. “She’s shown how attacking Republicans like me can impact elections—her involvement in both Senate elections to replace Jeff Flake and my husband John McCain, two regular targets of her personal attacks, resulted in Democrat wins,” Mrs. McCain said. “As Chairman of the AZGOP she managed to turn Arizona blue in November for the first time since 1996.”<br />Ms. Ward, who is up for re-election to her post next Saturday, hasn’t said how she will vote on the censure resolutions, but she has been critical of the party’s establishment wing in the past. She ran against Mr. McCain for the GOP Senate nomination in 2016.</td>

The San Francisco cocktail writer and author of the popular “Alcademics” cocktail blog has helped fuel a movement with a single-minded, glistening agenda: ensuring that anyone can make cocktail-bar-quality ice at home.<br />As Mr. English discovered in over 15 elaborate tests over the span of 18 years, making big ice is easy. Making clear ice isn’t. He has tried—and debunked—popular internet ice-making theories on achieving the much-coveted clarity. He froze distilled water. He boiled and then reboiled water from the tap before pouring it into molds. “I tried ridiculous experiments, like using carbonated water,” said Mr. English. “Which didn’t have a good chance of being the solution.” (It wasn’t.)<br />Eventually, he read Mariana Gosnell’s 2007 book, “Ice: The Nature, the History, and the Uses of an Astonishing Substance,” and in 2009, realized he could replicate the way a pond froze from the top down using a small Igloo cooler stashed in his freezer. It worked, ultimately inspiring a variety of products that apply the top-down freezing principle, but on a smaller scale. While Mr. English himself never managed to commoditize his breakthrough, he continues to consult and speak on the topic.<br />Here, five ways to keep your cool—for those who love munching on ice and others like Mr. English who seek true translucency.</td>

Six months on, China has yet to reveal what it has found—or how much of the work it has done. A team of WHO specialists land in the city of Wuhan on Thursday on a mission to find out.<br />Under the plan, Chinese scientists would comb through hospital records, test samples of sewage and blood donations, interview early victims and map food and people at the market in Wuhan where most of the earliest cases were identified. WHO researchers say they don’t have a clear understanding of the progress made by Chinese scientists. Inside China, officials have said little about what studies or data its scientists plan to show the WHO team, or which sites it will visit.<br />“Many of them are excellent scientists, and they have been quite active, but it’s very difficult to get the full picture of what has been done,” said Fabian Leendertz, a member of the mission and a microbiologist who was able to pinpoint the bat-infested tree where West Africa’s 2014 Ebola epidemic likely began. “It makes sense to simply go there, sit all at one table together.”<br />The WHO has said its mission isn’t about placing blame. “Let’s see where are the gaps, why do they exist, are they technical or whatever, and make a plan to fill those gaps,” said Dr. Leendertz.<br />For months, the U.N. agency has negotiated with Beijing for permission to enter China, review research and formulate a plan for the next round of studies. Answers could help prevent a different coronavirus outbreak—and offer some sense of closure on how a pandemic that has sickened at least 92 million people and devastated the global economy began.</td>

      <td>The CDC will require preflight testing as Covid-19 cases continue to soar and new, more infectious strains of the virus emerge</td>
      <td>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has ordered that all travelers flying to the U.S. from abroad will have to show proof of negative Covid-19 tests before boarding their flight starting Jan. 26. The CDC said preflight testing is necessary as Covid-19 cases continue to soar and new, more contagious strains of the virus emerge around the world.<br />Here is what you need to know about the new protocols before you take a trip.<br />The order applies to everyone traveling to the U.S. on international flights, including U.S. citizens. You will need to show negative test results even if you are flying on a private jet or charter flight. There are exceptions for children under age 2, airline crews, and federal law-enforcement agents and members of the military traveling for duty.<br />All of them. Passengers need to show proof of a negative test when traveling to the U.S. from any country, including Mexico and the Caribbean. Airlines can seek temporary waivers for certain countries where testing supplies are inadequate, but carriers haven’t yet said which countries might fall into this category.<br />The universal testing requirement goes into effect Jan. 26. People arriving from the U.K. already have been subject to similar testing requirements that went into effect in December following the emergence of a new coronavirus strain there.</td>

The real elephant in the room is the fact that no one carries coins around anymore because they have become essentially worthless. Our politicians are loath to admit that decades of inflation have made American coinage worth less than Monopoly money, so why would anyone bother to carry coins around in their daily lives? This is even more true today, when we have debit and credit cards, and smartphone pay apps.<br />The smallest euro note is five euros, and there are coins for one and two euros, as well as the usual cent denominations. We should do the same, with the possible exception of the elimination of the penny and the nickel.<br />Kurt Harris<br />Rockford, Ill.<br /></td>

Concern about the privacy of study participants sounds like a red herring. In sensitive legal or political documents, such information is either redacted or undisclosed from the start. Witness the many cases with parties named John Doe.<br />Public access to scientific research is even more important now when Big Pharma, Big Tech and political correctness dominate our professions and education system. The peer review that used to check scientific work is now often compromised by industry, money or ideology.<br />This rule is a good start. Science needs more transparency, not less.<br />Teresa R.

      <td>A show based on popular bodice-rippers gives an industry often dismissed as tawdry a much-needed embrace</td>
      <td>The new  Netflix  adaptation of the racy “Bridgerton” books has put pop culture in a swoon, giving a mainstream stamp of approval to romance novels sometimes dismissed as trash and boosting a literary genre that has suffered setbacks in recent years.<br />“Bridgerton,” which debuted last month, is based on bestselling author Julia Quinn’s romance series set in the Regency era. The love story about a wayward duke and a high-society bachelorette starring a multiracial cast is projected to stream to more than 63 million households over its first four weeks, according to Netflix. The lavish show, which hit number one on the Netflix charts in 76 countries, has vaulted Ms. Quinn’s roughly 20-year-old novels to the top of the general fiction bestseller lists.<br />“Hollywood studios are full of male producers, directors, writers,” said Amy Pierpont, editor in chief of Forever and Forever Yours, romance imprints of Grand Central Publishing. “The idea that the same value that’s applied to superhero movies would be applied to stories that center around women’s lives has just not happened on a consistent basis.”<br />The success of “Bridgerton” couldn’t have come at a better time for the romance industry, which has been struggling to retain its power in the publishing world. Recent years have marked a steady decline in print and ebook sales of romance novels, which went from more than 98 million units sold in 2012 to 41 million in 2020, according to NPD BookScan, whose figures do not reflect sales of self-published titles.<br />Novelists, publishing executives and literary agents point to a range of challenges. Big retail chains have stopped putting as many mass-market paperbacks on their shelves, they say, while the consolidation of printing plants has complicated distribution efforts. Others say less expensive digital self-publishing has cut into sales by traditional publishers.</td>

      <td>Iranian breaches of the 2015 nuclear deal raise fears that the country is paving the way to start work on nuclear weapons, raising pressure on President-elect Joe Biden</td>
      <td>Iran has in recent months repeatedly violated the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, reducing the time it would need to produce a nuclear weapon. The violations, a response to U.S. sanctions, have put at risk the survival of an agreement that helped remove sanctions on Iran and open it to business with the West.<br />The latest development emerged on Jan. 13 when the International Atomic Energy Agency told member states in a confidential report that Iran had told it in mid-December it planned to start producing uranium metal, a material vital for nuclear weapons. Iran says it is doing so for civilian purposes.<br />The disclosure came a week after Iran made one of its biggest steps yet to breach the 2015 deal, announcing it had begun enriching uranium at 20% purity. That crosses a red line European powers that are still party to the accord have previously set.<br />The most recent disclosure of plans to produce uranium metal—which has limited civilian utility—has stirred concern among Western officials over whether Iran is preparing to restart work toward a nuclear weapon.<br />Uranium metal is often used in the core of nuclear weapons. Production of the material, which hasn’t yet started, would be a clear breach of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers, in which it agreed to a 15-year moratorium on uranium and plutonium metallurgical production.</td>

      <td>ROME—Italy’s largest mafia trial in decades began Wednesday, as the country’s authorities try to rein in one of the world’s richest and most powerful crime syndicates, the ‘Ndrangheta.<br />The 325 defendants face charges including murder, extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering and other crimes in connection with the shadowy ‘Ndrangheta, whose wealth and international reach have eclipsed that of Sicily’s Cosa Nostra in recent decades.<br />The trial, which began with formalities on Wednesday, is taking place in a bunkerlike courtroom in the town of Lamezia Terme in Calabria, the ‘Ndrangheta’s home region in Italy’s deep South. Prosecutors hope it will mark a turning point in the fight against the ‘Ndrangheta by targeting the leadership of one of its most prominent clans and exposing how the organization has infiltrated local politics and business.<br />The ‘Ndrangheta has steadily risen to become one of the world’s most powerful drug-trafficking syndicates, controlling over 80% of Europe’s cocaine trade. Its tentacles extend to the Americas, Africa and Australia.<br />The organization’s estimated annual revenue of $55 billion, according to prosecutors, is greater than estimates for the drug cartels of Mexico and Colombia combined. It is thought to have some 20,000 members. Yet it remains much less well-known than the Cosa Nostra. Prosecutors hope the trial will reveal details of its internal structure and workings.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The federal budget gap widened in the first three months of the fiscal year, as government spending continued to outpace revenues while the economy slowly recovers from the pandemic-induced downturn.<br />The U.S. Treasury Department said Wednesday the deficit from October through December totaled a record $573 billion, a 61% increase from the same period a year earlier. Federal outlays rose 18%, to $1.4 trillion, driven higher primarily by automatic safety-net spending such as jobless benefits, nutrition assistance and health care. Total receipts held steady, at $803 billion, the Treasury said.<br />For the 12 months that ended in December, the government ran a $3.3 trillion deficit, more than triple the shortfall a year earlier and roughly 15.8% of U.S. gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output.<br />Government spending surged last year as Congress authorized several measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic and cushion the U.S. economy from recession, and federal revenues declined as businesses closed and millions of Americans lost their jobs. The Labor Department said last week the U.S. lost 140,000 jobs last month, ending a seven-month streak of job creation as virus outbreaks across the country prompted a new round of business restrictions.<br />Lawmakers authorized another $908 billion economic relief package last month, but Treasury officials said the government didn’t begin distributing the money—including stimulus checks—until this month, and it isn’t reflected in the figures released Wednesday.</td>

      <td>OVER THE past year, as many Americans began working from home—and letting their style standards dip—fashion and footwear brands from  Nike  to Gucci began pumping out inviting, slide-on shoes. Many were peculiar, backless models. These “you don’t even need to lift your heel” mules might suit a life of slovenly at-home shuffling. But are any stylish enough to wear outside? Men’s fashion editor Jacob Gallagher and sports columnist Jason Gay debate the issue.<br />Jason: Can we talk about slippers? Sweatpants and hoodies dominated spring quarantine-chic, but now that it’s winter, it’s all about slippers. Slippers are the new sweatpants. Discuss.<br />Jacob: Slippers keep you warm. That’s the practical justification but here’s the truth: We’ve all become lazy. Tying laces? That’s a chore. And no one’s going anywhere fancy. So slippers carry the day. Shuffle out in them to the store. No one will judge you.<br />Jason: Slippers are a blissfully lazy option. And I was perfectly capable of being lazy before the pandemic—I was lazy before it was cool. However, to me, a slipper is strictly a stay-at-home option. You can wear slides outside, but a slipper is never-touches-pavement footwear. Once a slipper goes outside, it’s ruined. Jacob, are you wandering around the supermarket in slippers?<br />Jacob: Never in true slippers, but in summer I did wear pool slides inside and out. I’ve since moved on to closed-toed, backless rubber Birkenstocks, which have proved warmer. They’re enticingly lazy, but if your vision is bad enough they kinda look like loafers. At least, that’s what I tell myself. Where do you fall on mules like that?</td>

The IAEA said Tehran had given it no timeline for when it would do so. Still, the development brings Iran closer to crossing the line between nuclear operations with a potential civilian use, such as enriching nuclear fuel for power-generating reactors, and nuclear-weapons work, something Tehran has long denied ever carrying out.<br />Iran’s ambassador to the IAEA, Kazem Gharib Abadi, said Wednesday on Twitter that Iran would produce uranium metal, saying it would allow the development of a new fuel for the Tehran civilian research reactor. Iran has said it would take four to five months to install the equipment to produce a uranium powder from which uranium metal is made.</td>

Nine other Chinese companies will be added, as well as more than 100 subsidiaries of companies already on the list, the people said.<br />The decision caps off a weekslong battle that pit Treasury officials, who feared widespread selloffs and economic fallout, against State Department and Pentagon officials seeking a tougher line against Beijing. Up until Wednesday morning, many in the State Department and Pentagon believed that they had a compelling case for the companies to be included once administrative kinks were ironed out, said the people familiar with the matter.<br />In the end, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin prevailed.</td>

Their 2020 season ended meekly, almost two weeks ago, with a modest triumph over the calamitous Jets. It was New England’s seventh win against nine losses, the franchise’s first losing record in 20 years.<br />Not very good. Not at all Patriots.<br />Still, Belichick expected to be busy this week. He was supposed to be in Washington, D.C., to be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, from the outgoing President Trump. As everyone knows now, he won’t. On Monday, word arrived that Belichick was declining the medal. In a statement, Belichick made reference to the “tragic events” last week at the U.S. Capitol, and said “remaining true to the people, team and country I love outweigh the benefits of any individual award.”<br />Now Belichick has an empty spot in his calendar. The taciturn coach, who coined workplace-fetish phrases like “Do Your Job” and once chanted “No days off!” at a championship celebration, has given himself an uncharacteristic gift: free time.</td>

      <td>An Aaron Sorkin film celebrates the Chicago Seven for plotting an attack on a party convention.</td>
      <td>The Chicago Seven were countercultural heroes in the 1960s. They thumbed their noses through one of the country’s most notorious political trials, taunting the judge and making a mockery of the proceedings with flippant courtroom pranks. Aaron Sorkin wrote and directed a movie about them last year, “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” which will probably win a few Oscars.<br />One thing people forget about the Chicago Seven is that most of them were guilty. Jerry Rubin admitted as much later: “We wanted disruption. We planned it. . . . We were guilty as hell. Guilty as charged.”<br />The crime they were accused of was crossing state lines to incite a riot. The defendants believed that Vice President Hubert Humphrey’s 1968 nomination for presidency was illegitimate. Nominations in those days were decided not by primaries but by backroom deals among party power brokers. The antiwar movement believed that a more democratic process would have produced a candidate opposed to the Vietnam War.<br />The question was whether the violent clashes between protesters and police outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago were an unfortunate consequence of peaceful marching that got out of hand, or whether the organizers intended for things to get violent.<br />In February 1970, a jury convicted the five ringleaders—Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, Tom Hayden, David Dellinger and Rennie Davis. Peaceful protest is one thing, but attempting to disrupt a legitimate election procedure by violent intimidation is never acceptable. After last week’s incursion at the Capitol, can the rest of us finally agree?</td>

      <td>Marketplace for secondhand goods targets $2.7 billion valuation in public debut</td>
      <td><br />Poshmark Inc.,  the online marketplace for secondhand goods, is set to go public as early as Thursday, the latest e-commerce site to tap the buoyant initial public offering market as the coronavirus pandemic continues to squeeze bricks-and-mortar stores.<br />A number of digital marketplaces, including Poshmark, reported more people selling goods in spring 2020 as a way to generate extra income and stave off boredom during widespread lockdowns. Poshmark sellers list everything from $17 reusable Starbucks cups to $3,000 Louis Vuitton handbags. While many traditional apparel companies struggled to survive, Poshmark was profitable for the first time in its 10-year history during the quarter that ended June 30.<br />Poshmark is expected to price its IPO on Wednesday. It has set a price range of $35 to $39, giving the company a valuation of roughly $2.7 billion at the midpoint of that range. The business was valued at $1.25 billion in 2019. Poshmark declined to comment, citing a regulatory quiet period ahead of its IPO.<br />The Redwood City, Calif.-based company follows  ContextLogic Inc.,  the parent of e-commerce marketplace Wish, which has traded below its IPO price of $24 after a rocky debut last month. The investor skepticism is an anomaly in an otherwise booming IPO market that has seen sky-high valuations and large gains from tech companies including  Airbnb Inc.  and  DoorDash Inc.</td>

      <td>After a user-policy change and a social-media crackdown, independent messaging apps Signal and Telegram are experiencing a surge in downloads</td>
      <td>Two apps—Signal and Telegram—are currently the No. 1 and No. 2 free app downloads in Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store. Millions of users flocked to the chat apps in recent weeks, according to data from Apptopia and Sensor Tower. There are a few factors behind the surge.<br />One is concern over a privacy-policy update for the  Facebook Inc. -owned WhatsApp. Meanwhile, the deplatforming of President Trump from prominent social networks following the U.S. Capitol riot has driven people to seek communication tools without moderators and external visibility.<br />On Jan. 7,  Tesla Inc.  Chief Executive Elon Musktweeted, “Use Signal.” A subsequent flood of users caused the app’s phone-number verification system  to break temporarily. Days later,  Twitter Inc.  CEO Jack Dorseypublished a screenshot of Signal at the top of the App Store charts, along with a heart emoji. At the same time, influential accounts on Parler, the social network popular among conservatives, called on followers to move to Telegram. Donald Trump Jr. actively posts in a public channel on the app.<br />What do Signal and Telegram have in common? Both are chat apps that offer end-to-end encryption outside of Big Tech’s grasp. Encrypted messaging apps like Signal and Telegram can offer more security, privacy and features than plain text messaging—but their encryption methods and data collection vary. Meanwhile, WhatsApp and  Apple Inc.’s  iMessage also offer end-to-end encryption, but within their respective ecosystems.<br />Here’s how to choose an encrypted chat app, and why you might want to.</td>

It continued to hover near that level Wednesday. The metric shows an average expectation for price increases over five years.<br />“This is quite a remarkable move, it has surprised us,” said Jorge Garayo, a rates and inflation strategist at  Société Générale .<br />Forecasts for higher prices are playing out in the bond market. Germany’s 10-year break-even rate, or the difference in yield between its benchmark bond and a price level-linked bond, climbed above 1% for the first time since February. Italy’s equivalent rate hit a more-than two-year high. Essentially, a higher break-even rate suggests investors expect prices to rise faster.<br />“With the onset of vaccines, people are upgrading their growth outlooks,” said  UBS  rates strategist Rohan Khanna.</td>

      <td>The things that have kept inflation low during the Covid-19 crisis are a lot different than the ones that used to keep it low. A whipsawing of prices when the pandemic passes is something to look out for.<br />The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that U.S. consumer prices rose 0.4% in December from November, putting them 1.4% above their year earlier level. Core prices, which exclude food and energy items to better capture inflation’s trend, rose 0.1% from November, and were up 1.6% on the year.<br />The Federal Reserve’s aim is for 2% inflation, and the consumer price measures it follows run cooler than the Labor Department’s.<br />Under inflation’s hood, though, there are some big shifts. Prices for food at home—groceries and the like—remain elevated as a result of the pandemic, and were up 3.9% in December from a year earlier. Meanwhile, prices for lodging at hotels and the like were down 11.2%.<br />Those are reflections of a broader trend in which goods prices have risen on the back of stronger demand during the pandemic while services inflation has cooled substantially. Core goods prices were up 1.7% on the year last month, which compared with a December 2019 gain of 0.1%. Core services prices were up 1.6%, which compared with a December 2019 gain of 3%.</td>

      <td>Beyond the impulse to get a cheap deal, it is unclear why the Canadian owner of Circle K gas stations might want to buy French supermarket Carrefour</td>
      <td>On the surface, Alimentation  Couche-Tard ’s  interest in French grocery chain Carrefour looks odd. One possible explanation is that the Canadian gas-station retailer has spotted an opportunity to reduce its dependence on fuel sales, at a time when European supermarket valuations look cheap.<br />Carrefour shares were up 15% Wednesday after Europe’s third-largest food retailer by market capitalization said it was in talks with the acquisitive Canadian business. Couche-Tard, which owns the Circle K brand of convenience stores, subsequently said it had made a nonbinding offer of almost $20 billion—a 29% premium to Tuesday’s market value. For the strategic rationale, it said only that it was “focused on creating stakeholder value.”<br />Buying Carrefour would be a surprising pivot. As recently as November, the Quebec-based company told shareholders that it was focused on doing deals in the U.S. and Asia, with no mention of European expansion. Entry into the extremely competitive French grocery market is hardly appealing, although Carrefour also has sizable businesses in Argentina and Brazil. There is no geographic overlap between the two companies, so it is difficult to see how a tie-up could generate many cost savings.<br />The French grocery company is cheap, however. As a multiple of projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Carrefour’s enterprise value—market value plus net debt—was six times before news of the approach broke. Other European supermarkets, such as  Tesco  and Ahold-Delhaize, also fetch low valuations. But Carrefour in particular has struggled for years to reduce its dependency on “hypermarkets,” a supersize format that has fallen out of fashion.<br />Couche-Tard traded for 9.5 times before news of its approach sent the stock down 10% in early Toronto trading Wednesday. If the company could persuade Carrefour investors to accept stock, it would make the deal math more attractive even without big synergies. However, the Canadian company said Wednesday that it expected to pay mostly in cash. With net debt of roughly 1.1 times Ebitda, Couche-Tard can afford to increase its leverage.</td>

      <td>PARIS—Canada’s  Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc.  said it has made a 16.1-billion-euro offer, equivalent to $19.66 billion, to buy French hypermarket chain  Carrefour SA,  as large retailers come under pressure to transform their bricks-and-mortar footprint amid pandemic restrictions on shopping and disruption from tech giants.<br />A merger would combine two companies with very different formats and geographical footprints into a $53 billion giant, making it the world’s third-largest grocery retailer, behind  Walmart Inc.  and Lidl owner Schwarz Group. Retailers are in a rush to find new ways to get food to customers ordering online as the spread of Covid-19 has massively accelerated online grocery shopping, including click-and-collect.<br />Carrefour—which opened its first store in 1960—is one of Europe’s largest grocery retailers. It also operates hypermarkets and supermarkets in Asia and Latin America. The 31-year-old Couche-Tard is the largest independent convenience store operator in North America by number of stores, operating under brands such as the Corner Store, Circle K and Holiday. It also operates a network of gas stations in Europe and has stores there and elsewhere in the world.<br />Carrefour shares were up 15.5% in Paris on Wednesday. Couche-Tard shares were down 10.05% in Toronto.<br />Jefferies analyst James Grzinic said he was a little blindsided by the talks, saying it was hard to map out synergies because overlap between the retailers is virtually nonexistent. He described the talks as a major departure from Couche-Tard’s stated strategy of maintaining return on capital employed at above 15%.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats take control of the White House and Senate this month with a large economic-relief package and $2,000 stimulus checks atop their agenda. But their slim majorities and procedural constraints will challenge their ability to design and pass those measures quickly.<br />The weeks ahead are critical for the new Democratic majorities as they try to deliver on campaign promises and shore up an uneven economic recovery. This period will test President-elect Joe Biden’s rhetoric about bipartisanship as Democrats determine how much they will work with Republicans and how they use the limited but powerful legislative tools they have to muscle their agenda through without the other party. Mr. Biden will release his detailed coronavirus relief plan Thursday and call for trillions of dollars from Congress.<br />“This is a chance to come in with a Democratic president who’s making a fresh start at a time when I think it’s understood that there are urgent needs and reforms that shouldn’t wait,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who is poised to be chairman of the Finance Committee. “[We can] really go on the offensive and really deal with some of the urgent economic needs that face working people.”<br />Mr. Wyden favors stimulus checks, pandemic-related health spending and expanded unemployment insurance tied to economic conditions instead of calendar deadlines.<br />Democrats agree broadly—but not universally—that a priority is to increase the $600 checks approved in December to $2,000, and they promised to do so if they won the Senate runoffs in Georgia. A report last week showing that employers shed 140,000 jobs in December, snapping seven months of employment gains, is adding to the pressure, though those losses came before December’s roughly $900 billion relief law was enacted.</td>

Even though coronavirus infections and deaths continue to escalate, luxury-travel firm Virtuoso says inquiries about trips started to climb as soon as vaccines were approved last year.<br />Demand is double-barreled.

      <td>WASHINGTON—On the first day of this session of Congress, every single House Republican rallied behind Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in their vote for House speaker.<br />Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) ultimately won her fourth term as House speaker. However, it was a high-water mark of GOP support for the California Republican, whose unwavering alliance with President Trump and unexpected string of House GOP wins on Election Night brought him closer than ever before to his longtime goal of becoming speaker of the House.<br />Now, just 10 days later, Mr. McCarthy faces tensions within the House GOP and doubts in some Republican quarters about his own leadership over his refusal to publicly challenge Mr. Trump and his support for disputing President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral victory after a violent mob of Mr. Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.<br />The question for both Mr. McCarthy and his party as a whole is whether the path back to power leads through spurning Mr. Trump, or continuing to embrace him. In a previously unthinkable move, Mr. McCarthy was asking other Republicans whether he should press Mr. Trump to resign, according to someone familiar with the discussions.<br />“This is more than an inflection point for the Republican Party and specifically House Republicans,” said former GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida. The force of Mr. McCarthy’s personal charisma and deep relationships are “by far his greatest asset and it’s very powerful,” he said. “He has survived past challenges, but this is a low point in our country and he’s in the middle of it.”</td>

      <td>Decision follows probe into risks that deal would give LSE outsize influence over trading, clearing and data services</td>
      <td>Europe’s antitrust watchdog on Wednesday approved London Stock Exchange Group PLC’s $15 billion deal to acquire Refinitiv Holdings Ltd. with conditions, removing a key hurdle in the company’s bid to challenge Bloomberg LP,  S&P Global Inc.  and other industry heavyweights offering financial data.<br />The decision by the European Commission ends a monthslong probe into the risks of the deal. Concerns were raised that the deal could give the  LSE  undue market power over trading and clearing government bonds, interest rate derivatives, and the sale of financial data such as stock- and bond-price quotes.<br />LSE is betting on the Refinitiv deal, first announced in 2019, to help it create a financial data juggernaut. It has been diversifying its operations away from stock trading and other traditional exchange businesses toward clearing and higher-margin data services that feed the rise of quantitative trading and passive investing.<br />Still, the largest exchange company in Europe by market value agreed to several concessions to win regulatory approval for the tie-up. London has long been Europe’s biggest financial center, anchored in part by the LSE. The concessions—in place for 10 years—center on the LSE granting equal access to its venue data to all existing and future competitors, continuing clearing services in line with EU regulations despite Brexit and the saleBorsa Italiana Group. The concessions also include a dispute resolution system for third parties to go to if the LSE doesn’t comply with its commitments.<br />Following Britain’s breakoff from the European Union, the bloc is under pressure to bolster the capabilities of the continent’s financial institutions, some analysts say. The remedies for the LSE deal highlight that pressure: It potentially undercuts the exchange’s ability to generate additional revenue from the proposed deal in areas such as clearing and trading government bonds and derivatives, and cross-selling data and other products between its customers and those of Refinitiv.</td>

After the vote, expected in the afternoon, the matter would go to the Senate, where the date of a trial, and the level of Republican support, is uncertain.<br />The president, in his first public appearance since the Capitol riot last week, said Tuesday he had no regrets about his remarks to supporters. He called the efforts to remove him from office over his comments a continuation of what he has termed a Democrat witch hunt.<br />House Democrats’ article of impeachment  alleges that Mr. Trump “willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged—and foreseeably resulted in—lawless action at the Capitol, such as: ‘if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore.’”<br />Late Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence rejected a push from the House to invoke the 25th Amendment to oust Mr. Trump over his role in the Capitol riot, setting in motion the House vote Wednesday.</td>

The next steps involve getting marketing and labeling approvals, and for the European Commission to sign off on the European Food Safety Authority’s decision.<br />The ruling provides a lift for companies such as Micronutris, a French edible insect farm which filed the application, and other startups including AgriProtein of South Africa, Netherlands-based Protix, and another French company, Ynsect, which is building a new farm with production capacity of more than 100,000 tons of bugs a year.<br />The bigger question, perhaps, is whether Europeans will want to eat bugs—long a popular snack in parts of Asia and Latin America—even if they are ground down into flour.<br />Giovanni Sogari, a researcher into social and consumption patterns at the University of Parma in Italy said many might find it difficult at first. “There are cognitive reasons derived from our social and cultural experiences, the so-called ‘yuck factor,’ that make the thought of eating insects repellent to many Europeans,” he said. “With time and exposure such attitudes can change.”</td>

      <td>Thursday, the president-elect will unveil a pandemic relief plan worth ‘trillions of dollars’; more checks for households, more money for states</td>
      <td>President-elect Joe Biden says he plans to detail Thursday the first major legislation of his incoming administration: a massive new stimulus and relief package meant to address the continuing economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Mr. Biden has called the $900 billion relief plan Congress passed three weeks ago a mere “down payment” on what is needed. Here’s what we know about the new administration’s emerging plan:<br />“It will be in the trillions of dollars,” Mr. Biden said Friday, arguing that more spending sooner will reduce the long-term economic damage from the shutdowns. Earlier that day, the Labor Department announced said that job creation had stalled in December and that the U.S. economy lost more than nine million jobs in 2020, the worst labor-market performance in records dating to 1939. The first broad pandemic relief plan, enacted by Congress in March, cost roughly $2 trillion.<br />Mr. Biden and Democratic legislative leaders have repeatedly endorsed $2,000 direct payments to most Americans, calling the $600 checks in the December bill insufficient. The Biden plan would likely add $1,400 to the earlier payments to reach $2,000 total.<br />Mr. Biden said Friday there would be “billions of dollars” to speed up vaccine distribution, “tens of millions of dollars to help reopen our schools,” and “tens of billions of dollars” to allow state and local governments to keep paying teachers, police officers and health workers. He cited extending unemployment insurance and rent relief, and suggested he wants to modify the small-business assistance program to ensure more aid for minority-owned businesses. He also reiterated his support for raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from the current $7.25, though it is unclear if that will be part of the relief package.</td>

The proposed all-cash transaction is valued at about $1.4 billion, Qualcomm said, before working capital and other adjustments.<br />Nuvia’s expertise in designing central processing units, Qualcomm said, would help it boost chip performance and power efficiency—characteristics that are vital to success in the hot 5G-networking market that Qualcomm has made a priority.<br />The San Diego-based chip company is also bolstering its talent pool with the planned acquisition, adding Nuvia’s staff and three founders, Gerard Williams III, Manu Gulati and John Bruno. Mr. Williams was lead chip architect at Apple before decamping to start Nuvia two years ago. Mr. Gulati and Mr. Bruno both worked at Apple and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google unit before Nuvia.<br />“The Nuvia team are proven innovators,” said Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm’s president who this month was named to replace Steve Mollenkopfas chief executive at midyear.</td>

Verizon Communications Inc.  told staff this week it won’t require them to get vaccinated, and  CVS Health Corp. , whose pharmacists are distributing vaccines and are themselves eligible for doses, said it encourages but doesn’t mandate shots.<br />Many hourly workers face challenges in getting to vaccine appointments, from child-care needs and transportation limitations to scheduling constraints from holding multiple jobs.

Etsy’s stock has more than quadrupled over the past year. The seller of homemade goods is now valued at more than $23 billion, well over half the value of  eBay ,  despite the fact that it is predicted to generate less than 20% of the sales of its consumer-tech peer in the fourth quarter.<br />Etsy’s sky-high valuation has been earned through its rapid growth over the past few quarters. Sales in the second and third quarters grew an average of nearly 145% year on year, according to FactSet, and traffic and search trends from the last two months of the year suggest the fourth quarter will also be stellar.<br />Traffic to Etsy’s website rose an average of nearly 96% in November and December, according to SimilarWeb data, which Jefferies says is the highest level of monthly growth it has recorded from the company over the past two years. Meanwhile, growth in Google searches for Etsy also appears to have accelerated in the last two months of the year relative to October, though not as significantly. Together, these trends bode well for fourth-quarter results, which Etsy generally reports in late February.<br />But investors might want to start asking themselves whether year-end outperformance is now baked into the stock, and just how long Etsy can continue to grow at the meteoric pace necessary to maintain its current valuation.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The challenge by some Republicans to the 2020 election results last week is fueling a rift between the party and big companies and could accelerate changes to the GOP’s fundraising base.<br />In the week since more than 100 Republicans objected to the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s win, at least a dozen U.S. corporations said they would reconsider donating money from their political-action committees to lawmakers who sided with President Trump’s challenge to the results. Dozens more have said they are halting all political giving in response to the events last week, when supporters of Mr. Trump attacked the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying Mr. Biden’s victory.<br />The Republican Party has already seen its share of corporate PAC donations shrink compared with eight years ago, according to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. In the 2012 election, after the GOP had won control of the House during the Obama administration, Republicans received 63% of the $365 million total given by business PACs. In 2020, Republicans got 57% of corporate PAC donations.<br />Employees in some key business sectors have also shifted their political giving toward Democrats, data from the Center for Responsive Politics indicates. Between the 2012 and 2020 elections, Republicans have seen declines in the share of donations to candidates, PACs and party committees from employees in the securities and investment, finance, business services and real-estate sectors.<br />In the Senate, where Republicans will try to win back the majority in the next election, some Republican lobbyists and business executives said they are worried about facing backlash if they steer company PAC donations to the GOP’s campaign committee, which is run by Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.), who objected to the certification of Mr. Biden’s election. Outside political groups, such as one affiliated with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), are also expected to take a hit.</td>

The pandemic has accelerated the growth of at-home fitness apps, which have relied on music as a draw to live-streamed and on-demand classes led by remote instructors—who have become much like influencers and DJs in their own right.<br />While streaming on music services like Spotify and Apple Music has increased during pandemic lockdowns, closed venues, restaurants and retailers where music is played, as well as the pause on touring and live shows, has weighed on the music business. At the same time, videogaming, social video on apps like TikTok and digital fitness have taken off—each with opportunities labels, publishers and other copyright owners are eyeing for music.<br />The digital fitness market has taken off with  Peloton Interactive Inc.’s  stationary bikes,  Lululemon Athletica Inc.’s  purchase of Mirror,  Apple Inc.’s  introduction of Fitness+, as well as upstarts like Supernatural VR and Hydrow.<br />Equinox launched its Variis mobile app in March, giving its bricks-and-mortar gym members free access to virtual classes just as stay-at-home orders and lockdown restrictions were sweeping through cities across the country. It also began selling its SoulCycle at-home bikes for $2,500. In October, Variis became nationally commercially available to nonmembers for $40 a month.</td>

The move essentially combined a few of 2020’s hottest trends: a SPAC, a disruptive touchless technology and housing fever. Together, they have brought much hype to an unproven business that might have lost a key competitive edge.<br />While the onset of the pandemic temporarily derailed the iBuying business, which is focused on buying and reselling homes electronically, more recent trends have played to its strengths. Low interest rates and the rise of remote work have brought new buyers into the market, while skyrocketing home prices have enticed homeowners to try to cash out while demand is hot.<br />Opendoor shares closed their first day of trading on their own in December with a market value of roughly $17 billion based on the number of shares outstanding listed in a filing last month. That is up from a post-money valuation of just $3.8 billion following the company’s last venture raise early in 2019, according to PitchBook.<br />Having launched in 2014, Opendoor had established a sizable first-mover advantage in the iBuying market, with revenue growing 158% to $4.7 billion in 2019. That compares with just $1.4 billion in 2019 revenue for Zillow’s iBuying business.</td>

Store-based sales increased 4.2%, while digital sales more than doubled during that period, driven by same-day online pickup and delivery orders, the company said.<br />“The momentum in our business continued in the holiday season with notable market share gains across our entire product portfolio,” Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said in a statement. Target has invested heavily in recent years to expand its online business largely by sourcing online orders from stores’ shelves. Around 95% of Target sales in the period were sourced from stores, the company said.<br />Retailers are reporting mixed holiday results. Target and other large retailers have generally performed well during the pandemic. Most of the top performers are retailers that either stayed open during early lockdowns or those that sell food, home goods or other products that are increasingly in demand as more shoppers stay home. Many of the top performers had robust e-commerce businesses already in place before the pandemic and are now benefiting as more shopping shifts online.<br />Earlier this week  Lululemon Athletica Inc.  raised its fourth-quarter financial guidance after a strong holiday season as more shoppers bought athletic gear and comfortable clothing.</td>

But most vanilla financiers have more to lose than win by diving into digital assets.<br />Open interest in  CME ’s  bitcoin futures has surged by more than 250% since the beginning of October.

Cineworld Group  PLC,  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,   Carnival Corp.  and other companies with bleak outlooks because of the pandemic found financial lifelines to tide them over.<br />These deals continued a trend dating back months before the vaccines were approved, as actions taken by the Federal Reserve and Congress, coupled with investors’ eagerness to continue lending, kept the corporate default rate well below analysts’ expectations.<br />But the sluggish rollout of the vaccines is now undermining the timeline that investors projected when extending emergency credit. The U.S. government fell well short of its goal of vaccinating 20 million Americans in 2020, having administered just 2.8 million doses by the end of last year, according to federal figures, in part due to differing state policies that have led to confusion and shipment delays. The emergence of the more-contagious U.K. coronavirus mutation in the U.S. has also raised the likelihood of further government restrictions and consumers being more cautious about leaving their homes.<br />So far, more than 25.4 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, but only 8.9 million Americans have received a shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</td>

The internal agency memo, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, was signed by a political appointee and isn’t binding.<br />Congressional Democrats and progressive groups have urged President-elect Joe Biden to forgive most or all of the $1.6 trillion in federal student debt unilaterally in his first 100 days in office. They argue that existing law authorizes the executive branch to forgive student debt without any action from Congress.<br />“We believe the Secretary does not have the statutory authority to cancel, compromise, discharge, or forgive, on a blanket or mass basis, principal balances of student loans, and/or to materially modify the repayment amounts or terms thereof,” Reed Rubinstein, the Education Department’s principal deputy general counsel, wrote in the memo to Mrs. DeVos. Mr. Rubinstein’s tenure will end along with those of other appointees when the new administration takes office Jan. 20.<br />Mr. Biden, a Democrat, has said he supports writing off $10,000 in student debt for every borrower as part of a package of measures to help households financially during the pandemic.

      <td>Hedge funds score gains when blank-check companies rise after announcing deals to take startups public</td>
      <td>Sudden excitement about the flurry of startups going public through so-called blank-check companies is enriching some of the biggest players in finance, particularly hedge funds.<br />The gains come through the unique rights given to early investors in special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, which look to acquire promising startups and take them public. As the vehicles become more popular, the hedge funds that invest in them early on, such as Magnetar Capital, Glazer Capital and Israel Englander’s Millennium Management, can earn lofty returns without much risk.<br />Here is how the trade typically works: Hedge funds give the SPAC money for up to two years while it looks for a merger target. In return, they get a unique right to withdraw their investment before a deal goes through that minimizes any loss on the trade. At the same time, the potential return for early investors is huge if the SPAC shares rise because they also initially receive shares and warrants giving them the right to buy more shares at a specified price in the future.<br />Wall Street’s recent exuberance has engulfed SPACs, with day traders and large institutions alike pouring money into shell companies pursuing startups tied to themes such as green energy or sports betting. Recent SPACs have surged immediately after announcing deals to take startups public, giving the hedge funds opportunities to sell and turn quick profits.<br />One example came Jan. 7, when shares of the venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya’s  Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. V  advanced 63% after it said it is combining with Social Finance Inc. to take the financial-technology company public.</td>

      <td>In latest annual trust survey, U.S. respondents back business at a higher percentage than other institutions</td>
      <td>People have more faith in their own employer than leaders in government and business, according to a new study released Wednesday.<br />Overall, trust in institutions remains low, but business earned the highest marks, said the annual survey by the public-relations firm Edelman. The poll represented the company’s 21st analysis of public trust in major institutions and surveyed more than 33,000 people in 28 countries over the past several months.<br />More than half of U.S. respondents, 54%, said they trust business, which was more than was said for nongovernmental organizations, government or media. Nearly three-quarters of U.S. respondents said their own employer, in particular, was a mainstay of trust.<br />“Business has to help the country knit itself back together, to be the connective tissue, while the politics are sorted out,” said Richard Edelman, the company’s chief executive.<br />The findings continue a trend. Last year’s poll also showed crumbling trust in institutions amid anxiety about corruption, future employment prospects and the wage gap between the rich and middle classes.</td>

      <td>U.S. intelligence officials have said publicly that BGI products pose privacy risks</td>
      <td>At least two federal agencies worked to distribute Covid-19 tests from a Chinese genetics company, despite warnings about security risks from U.S. intelligence and security officials, according to interviews and documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal.<br />In the early days of the virus, BGI Group or people trying to distribute its products approached at least 11 states in a sometimes aggressive push to get the products into government-run laboratories or set up entire labs, according to people who received the approaches and documents.<br />BGI, China’s leading genetics company, enlisted a foundation tied to a former U.S. president and used a company linked to the United Arab Emirates’ top spy to promote its efforts. A prominent New York real-estate lawyer threatened to complain to California’s governor if state health officials there didn’t use BGI’s tests.<br />Some of the company’s testing supplies were used in Nevada, according to the head of the state’s Covid-19 task force. BGI has tried in the past to get into the U.S. market and has sold testing equipment to U.S. private labs that advertise their work for government clients.<br />In March, an FBI special agent who monitors biotech threats for the Department of Health and Human Services told an HHS advisory committee that government agencies should be wary of doing business with the company, which, he said, had a history of misusing personal data. The agent, Ed You, echoed warnings from other law-enforcement, security and military-intelligence officials.</td>

      <td>Main British stock index has climbed nearly 8% in dollar terms since the start of December, outperforming the S&P 500 and other major benchmarks</td>
      <td>British stocks have enjoyed a world-beating rally since the start of December, with international investors beginning to buy back into one of their least-loved countries.<br />The U.K. benchmark, the FTSE 100, is up nearly 8% since Dec. 1 in dollar terms. That puts it well ahead of the S&P 500, the MSCI World and the Euro Stoxx indexes, despite the U.K. being among the hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The recent market rally doesn’t make up for its stark underperformance since the U.K. voted to leave Europe in 2016. In dollar terms, the FTSE 100 is still below where it closed on June 23, 2016, the day of the Brexit referendum.<br />Britain did manage to conclude a slim new trade deal with the European Union on Christmas Eve, eliminating fears that it might break away from the bloc at the end of 2020 with all its exports subject to tariffs and restrictions. But the bare-bones deal leaves much to be negotiated. The British pound hasn’t benefited either, confounding those who believe that U.K. assets are now more attractive.<br />As investors move money into U.K. assets, they need to buy the British currency, and that should lift the pound. Savvas Savouri, chief economist at Toscafund Asset Management, a $4 billion hedge fund, believes the pound’s fundamental value in euros is about €1.30 apiece. But since Dec. 23, it remained flat at €1.11 before rising to €1.12 on Wednesday.</td>

The news that Lenovo would join the STAR Market, China’s answer to the Nasdaq, boosted its Hong Kong-traded shares, which on Wednesday hit their highest level since 2015.<br />A series of Chinese technology companies have recently listed in mainland China or in Hong Kong, amid heightened tensions with the U.S. Beijing has also encouraged companies to join the fledgling STAR Market, also known as the Science and Technology Innovation Board, by introducing more relaxed listing rules and other requirements compared with other Chinese markets.<br />Lenovo and Megvii Technology Ltd., an artificial-intelligence startup specializing in facial recognition, will be among the first companies to make use of a structure known as a Chinese depositary receipt to raise funds.<br />In a filing late Tuesday, Lenovo said it planned to sell stock equivalent to up 10% of its enlarged ordinary share count. Its shares jumped 9.7% on Wednesday, giving the company a market value of nearly $14 billion.</td>
