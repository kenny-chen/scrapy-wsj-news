      <td>After his blown calls on vaccines and the economy, some lawmakers don’t even want to let him start wars.</td>
      <td>Old Democratic friends have been warning President Joe Biden not to inflict his supersized stimulus plan on a growing economy in no need of rescue. Today these old hands from the Obama administration are enjoying vindication. Various reports show a robust recovery bearing no resemblance to the dismal scene described by the president. After Mr. Biden’s faulty diagnosis and treatment plan for the economy, now it seems that some members of his party don’t even want to trust him with nuclear weapons.<br />The news of the day is rising prosperity. The Journal’s John McCormickreports:<br />Also today, the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew a little faster than it initially thought in the fourth quarter of 2020. Turns out that the Biden “inheritance” from predecessor Donald Trump was a strong 4.1% annual rate of real economic growth in our 45th president’s last full quarter in office.<br />The news is also getting better for workers. The Journal’s Eric Morath reports:<br />In and out of government, just about everyone seems to have noticed that the economy is much stronger than our president understands. At the New York Times Neil Irwin noted this week:</td>

      <td>Shipping turmoil, warehouse issues cost importers, restaurants during fish’s most popular season; ‘six months of shrimp rings’</td>
      <td>Clogged ports and full freezers are snarling the flow of seafood to American dinner plates, boosting costs for fish suppliers and consumers.<br />A flood of imports, and workforces diminished by Covid-19, have caused backlogs at major U.S. ports, stranding containers of frozen fish on ships and docks in places like California and New Jersey.  Freezers in key port cities are also filling up, often leaving seafood with nowhere to go once it is unloaded, and prompting importers to shuttle fish between warehouses or across longer distances to find cold storage.<br />Those bottlenecks are running up against Lent, when many Christians abstain from meat and Americans eat more seafood than during any other time of year, retail data show. Most seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported, and soaring transportation and logistics costs are erasing profits on some container loads of fish. Higher costs are rippling through the supply chain, executives said, helping push up seafood prices for consumers alongside other rising food costs.<br />Kim Gorton, chief executive of Boston-based seafood supplier Slade Gorton & Co., said importers have had containers of seafood stuck at ports for up to three weeks, with related storage charges eating up profit on the fish in days. Her company has had varieties like shrimp and cod held up for days, and she has had to ferry loads of salmon between freezers to make room for other shipments.<br />“The entire system is seized up,” Ms. Gorton said. “A lot of us are basically driving product around to find if there is any room at the inn.”</td>

      <td>Bill would extend civil-rights protections to gay, transgender people</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The House voted 224 to 206 Thursday on legislation to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, an expansive effort that has spurred fierce opposition among conservatives over religious freedom and set off a new round of partisan fighting in Congress.<br />The measure, known as the Equality Act, marks a major plank of what Democrats term their equality agenda, following earlier laws treating attacks against gay people as hate crimes and allowing gay people to serve openly in the military. The Equality Act would amend the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination based on race, religion, sex and other characteristics, to include sexual orientation and gender identity.<br />“It is needed because there is discrimination against people in the LGBTQ community,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said on Thursday. “It breaks my heart that it is necessary,” she said, choking up a press conference.<br />The White House supports the legislation but its fate in the Senate is uncertain. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) on Thursday declined to say when he would schedule the measure for a vote.<br />In a press conference with the Capitol as a backdrop and later on the House floor, Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus denounced the legislation, saying that it would discriminate against certain adoption agencies that don’t allow adoptions by same-sex parents, undermine women’s sports, and block healthcare providers from declining to perform abortions on the basis of their religious beliefs.</td>

      <td>Lovers of large-scale musicals have been feeling more than usually deprived by the Covid-19 pandemic. In theory, it shouldn’t be impossible to webcast a musical, but it’s technically very difficult—too many people, too much stuff going on—and the only one I’ve reviewed, the Irish Repertory Theatre’s wonderful revival of “Meet Me in St. Louis,” was a scaled-down version in which the actors “phoned in” their performances, taping them from their separate homes, after which they were edited together in the studio. So it is inspiring to report that Virginia’s Signature Theatre, one of the top American regional theaters that specialize in musicals, is webcasting “Simply Sondheim,” a fully-staged 33-song revue directed and choreographed by Matthew Gardiner and performed in the company’s empty 275-seat theater by 12 singers and a 15-player pit orchestra. No, it’s not “Sweeney Todd” on a Broadway-sized stage, but it is fabulously fine in its own right and comes across with irrepressible vitality on a small screen.<br />Signature Theatre’s imaginative revivals of the musicals of Stephen Sondheim have given the company a well-deserved national reputation for excellence. That said, I wasn’t expecting “Simply Sondheim” to be quite as good as it is, since greatest-hits musical revues too often feel aimless. Not this one: Mr. Gardiner’s scenery-free staging, in which the songs are locked together without benefit of plot or connective narration, moves from number to number so quickly that you scarcely have time to catch your breath. “Simply Sondheim” has no dead spots, no slack patches, no weak moments of any kind: Every element of the show is exactly right, including Justin Chiet’s cinematography and the clean, precise playing of the orchestra, which brings out the myriad subtleties of Jonathan Tunick’s original orchestrations.<br />Everyone in the cast is so fine that I’m reluctant to single out any individual member for particular praise. Still, I mustn’t fail to mention Tracy Lynn Olivera, who charges through “Getting Married Today,” the fastest and most notoriously complex of Mr. Sondheim’s tongue-twisting patter songs, in such a way as to make you wonder why her performance didn’t set off a sonic boom in the theater. And that’s not the best part: Ms. Olivera acts the lyrics instead of just tossing them off, thus making the song not merely funny but also moving.<br />Trust me when I tell you, though, that every performer and every performance in “Simply Sondheim” lands squarely on target. (O.K., one more special mention: Norm Lewis sings “Being Alive” with extreme sensitivity.) I would have gladly paid to see this show in the theater, and Signature Theatre should give serious thought to remounting it when the pandemic is over. It deserves real, in-person applause.<br /></td>

      <td>Move extends a recent climb in government bond yields</td>
      <td>A wave of selling in U.S. government bonds intensified on Thursday, sending yields soaring after new data indicated a strengthening economic recovery and an auction of seven-year Treasurys met with tepid demand from investors.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note reached as high as 1.539% before finishing Thursday’s session at 1.513%, according to Tradeweb—its highest level in a year and up from 1.388% at Wednesday’s close.<br />Moves were also pronounced in shorter-dated bonds. The five-year yield rose to 0.799% Thursday from its previous close of 0.612%—the largest one day gain since December 2010.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed after Labor Department data showed that the number of jobless claims fell sharply last week, signaling the job market could be stabilizing after layoffs edged higher earlier in the winter.<br />Investors tend to sell Treasurys when they expect faster growth and inflation, which lowers the value of bonds’ fixed payments and can eventually lead the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The fate of Neera Tanden’s nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget came down to two centrist senators after another Republican added his name to the list of lawmakers who oppose confirming her.<br />Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said on Thursday that he would vote against Ms. Tanden. Mr. Grassley, who often votes with other Republicans but has backed many of President Biden’s cabinet nominees so far, hadn’t disclosed his position.<br />The White House is now homing in on Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) and Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.), people involved in the discussions said. A “no” vote from either senator, neither of whom has so far tipped her hand, would doom Ms. Tanden’s chances of clearing the Senate.<br />Executive-branch nominations require a majority vote of 51 senators to pass the chamber. Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie. Because control of the Senate is divided evenly between Democrats and Republicans, a single Democratic defection can throw a nomination into uncertainty.<br />Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said last week that he would vote against Ms. Tanden, meaning a Republican would have to break with other members of the party and join the remaining 49 Democrats for the nomination to pass. If Ms. Sinema joins Mr. Manchin in opposing her, Ms. Tanden would need a second Republican to cross party lines, an outcome that Senate aides said was unlikely.</td>

      <td>Katherine Tai at Senate confirmation hearing says she plans to accelerate talks with EU in bid to end counter-tariffs</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden’s pick for U.S. Trade Representative said she would accelerate negotiations with the European Union to resolve a longstanding dispute over commercial-aircraft subsidies, citing the fight’s negative impact across several industries.<br />Speaking at her confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee, Katherine Tai, a veteran government trade lawyer, said the 16-year-old dispute over how governments subsidize  Boeing Co.  and  Airbus SE  has led to counter-tariffs—sanctioned by the World Trade Organization—on food and beverage products, causing “disruption” and “pain.”<br />“At the core of this…is the need for the U.S. and the EU to come together to figure out an answer,” Ms. Tai said. “I would very much be interested in figuring out how to land this particular plane because it has been going on for a very long time.”<br />Restaurant and beverage industries have been pushing for a solution to the aircraft dispute, which has heaped pressure on businesses already struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic. The Trump administration imposed tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European wine and food items such as cheese and olives in late 2019. The EU hit back with levies on U.S. whiskey, nuts and tobacco.<br />The EU’s trade commissioner, Vladis Dombrovskis, called for a mutual suspension of tariffs in the aircraft dispute this month.</td>

      <td>Imagine for a moment two objects in your hands. One is a piece of paper and the other a rubber band. If you squeeze your hands together hard and let go, the paper will remain crumpled, but the rubber band will return to its original shape.<br />Economists tend to think of the economy as the rubber band. After a shock, they expect it to go back to normal. When it doesn’t, like the crumpled paper, they call the effect “hysteresis”—lasting changes caused by some large perturbation. The Covid-19 pandemic is a classic example. What permanent damage to the economy will it leave behind?<br />The first place to look is in classrooms, say Eric Hanushek and Margaret Raymond, economists and education researchers at Stanford University. Lost study time for children during the pandemic has the potential to do lasting harm not just to their own long-term prospects but to American prosperity in general, say the married couple.<br />Ms. Raymond studied 18 states and Washington, D.C. and concluded that, on average, children lost 116 days of reading time during the early stages of the pandemic last year and 215 days of math work—instruction that will be hard to regain and could leave a whole generation of children struggling to keep up in their studies and testing. If your child misses out on learning fractions now, how will she perform in algebra later?<br />And the shock has been distributed unevenly. Children in rural areas and areas with large Black and Hispanic populations were hit the hardest. Among the states suffering the most are South Carolina and Illinois, according to Ms. Raymond’s study.</td>

On that same day I checked out Amazon, and the book “When Harry Became Sally” was indeed no longer listed. Ironically, however, Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” was still available for purchase.

Pleasant, S.C.<br />I recently chatted online for a half hour with two offshore Amazon reps who deliberately and disingenuously told me that Ryan T. Anderson’s “When Harry Became Sally” was digitally available on Amazon. They finally conceded that the link they sent to the movie “When Harry Met Sally” was not what I sought and that Mr. Anderson’s book was no longer available on Amazon. Then I simply purchased the book directly from its publisher, Encounter, at a reasonable price with a 15% first-time discount to boot. It is possible to wean ourselves from Amazon dependency (74 million people voted against tech censorship in November), and, until we do, Amazon and its ilk will exercise the power we cede to them.</td>

      <td>Legendary investor Charlie Munger continued a war of words Thursday with popular online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc. over the way it and others have enabled and profited from the recent boom of individual investing.<br />“I hate this luring of people into engaging in speculative orgies,” Mr. Munger told The Wall Street Journal from his Los Angeles home. Robinhood “may call it investing, but that’s all bullshit.”<br />He added, “It’s really just wild speculation, like casino gambling or racetrack betting. There’s a long history of destructive capitalism, these trading orgies whooped up by the people who profit from them.”<br />Mr. Munger, 97 years old, is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Warren Buffett’s longtime business partner. His comments Thursday echoed criticisms he lobbed at Robinhood the day before.<br />Those initial barbs from Mr. Munger prompted a sharp retort from the brokerage. Robinhood spokeswoman Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay said his comments were “disappointing and elitist.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Department of Homeland Security for the first time is refocusing some of its grant programs toward fighting domestic violent extremism, a priority under the Biden administration.<br />In total, state and local governments receiving grants will be required to spend at least $77 million combating domestic violent extremism, the department said Thursday.<br />“While we continue to lawfully protect against threats posed by foreign terrorist organizations, we also must ensure adequate focus and funding is provided to combat domestic terrorism, some of which is motivated by false narratives and extremist rhetoric spread through social media and other online platforms,” DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said.<br />Mr. Mayorkas said the grants will improve the country’s security by giving priority to activities that combat extremism, “including open-source analysis of threats, execution of threat assessment programs, the development and sharing of intelligence across states and between states and the federal government, and the development of training and awareness programs.”<br />The grants represent “a tiny fraction of overall U.S. government spending for counterterrorism writ large, but it’s a start,” said Javed Ali, who left senior counterterrorism posts at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Council in 2018 and now teaches at the University of Michigan. DHS’s move “arguably sets the stage for even larger allocations down the road.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Capitol Hill waited Thursday for the Senate parliamentarian to weigh in on whether the chamber’s rules would permit Democrats to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour as part of President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.<br />The decision by Elizabeth MacDonough, the chief Senate parliamentarian, will set the stage for an intense debate among Democrats about how to proceed on the contentious provision. Democrats, who can’t afford to lose a single vote among their own ranks to pass the bill in an evenly divided Senate, have split over the push to raise the federal minimum wage, which would boost it to $15 an hour over four years.<br />“We’re waiting, as we all are, to hear from the Senate parliamentarian as to what will happen with the minimum wage piece of the legislation,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) told reporters Thursday. “I feel that we have a very, very strong argument and we have a very big need in our country to pass the minimum wage.”<br />The minimum-wage increase is the most divisive issue in the aid package, which Democrats broadly support. The package would also provide a $1,400 payment to many Americans; extend and enhance federal unemployment assistance; send $350 billion in aid to state and local governments; and pour new funding into vaccine distribution, food stamps and schools.<br />Democratic and Republican staff made their arguments before the parliamentarian Wednesday morning on the minimum-wage provision and have been waiting since then to hear her recommendation.</td>

      <td>A Netflix documentary looks back on the short life of the Notorious B.I.G., born Christopher Wallace, through interviews with his mother and rap collaborators.</td>
      <td>Head east on Fulton Street in Brooklyn, N.Y., where the neighborhood of Clinton Hill is about to ease into Bed-Stuy, and you cross St. James Place, at the point where it’s been renamed Christopher “Notorious B.I.G.” Wallace Way. The intersection’s namesake is on view in a portrait that occupies one corner, the eyes hidden behind sunglasses, a baleful look balancing on his face. It’s the perfect representation of a public persona.<br />The marvelous thing about the documentary “Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell” is the way it gets behind the image, and the sunglasses, to the heavy kid with the lazy eye who grew up on a nearby tree-lined block—off the “bad luck avenue,” as he himself will call it—and became one of the biggest stars of hip hop, maybe its best.<br />“You have no origins for what rap planet this guy came from,” says Sean Combs, aka Puff Daddy aka P. Diddy, the rapper-producer for whose Bad Boy label Wallace recorded his debut album (“Ready to Die,” the only one released before the rapper’s shooting death, at age 24, in 1997). Mr. Combs is lavish in his praise of Wallace’s talents with the mic, and the rhymes. His sentiments are echoed throughout Emmett Malloy’s almost too-short documentary.<br />Produced in cooperation with Wallace’s estate—his mother, Voletta, is an executive producer as well as the film’s emotional center—“Biggie” benefits from simply being a great story, an American story, almost a Horatio Alger tale if Ragged Dick had sold crack on Fulton while being careful not to let his mother catch him. Mr. Malloy also benefits from having at his disposal the apparently vast video archive of childhood friend and posse member Damion Butler, who taped everything and began early: Wallace would often instruct him, Mr. Butler recalls, to record the audiences rather than the performances, to see what numbers and lyrics went over best and how they could calibrate the flow of a show. It’s an invaluable resource for director Malloy, as is the willingness of so many Wallace friends and associates to talk—not just celebrities like Mr. Combs, but Brooklynites who knew Wallace when he was a kid living with his single mom, dropping out of school and succumbing to the lure of the crack trade.<br />Mr. Butler is one. Another is the jazz saxophonist Donald Harrison, who lived near the Wallace apartment and took the young music fan under his wing. One of the more captivating and revealing segments involves Mr. Harrison’s recollection of having introduced his protégé to the work of Max Roach and the jazz immortal’s use of polyrhythms and tonal percussion. Mr. Malloy doesn’t just let us draw our own conclusions about the consequent influence of Roach’s drumming on Wallace’s rapping. He overlays a Roach solo on a Wallace performance and the result is not just an uncanny musical moment but, in case one needed it, something of a validation of rap as serious musical art. (No one mentions it, but Roach grew up in the neighborhood, too, only a few blocks from where Wallace and Harrison lived.)</td>

      <td>Starring Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, Florian Zeller’s feature explores the mind of a man experiencing memory loss.</td>
      <td>In one sense “The Father,” opening in theaters, amounts to a chamber piece. It’s a relatively small-scale production that centers on a widower father and his dutiful daughter. Eighty-year-old Anthony, played by Anthony Hopkins, lives alone in his quite comfortable London flat, though with ever more difficulty as his memory declines and his confusion grows. Anne, played by Olivia Colman, visits him as often as she can, though she’s no substitute for any of the full-time caregivers he has tolerated briefly, then chased away. Yet the film looms large dramatically because its true chamber is Anthony’s mind, a fantastical place where memories swirl, delusions dance, pleasures beckon, terrors arise unbidden and people both beloved and mistrusted keep splitting off into other identities. The two Anthonys, by contrast, coalesce. Actor merges with character in a performance that’s astonishing and inspiring in equal measure.<br />The screenplay was adapted by Christopher Hampton from a French stage play by Florian Zeller, who is making an auspicious debut as a feature director. (His work finds its complement in the probing yet unobtrusive cinematography of Ben Smithard. Ludovico Einaudi wrote the music.) It takes a while—at least it took me a while—to realize that Mr. Zeller and his collaborators are playing intricate mind games with the audience in order to reflect the disjunctures of its hero’s inner life. What might have been predictable or sentimental in other hands becomes startling in the film’s approach, as well as beguiling, unsparing, terribly moving and occasionally very funny.<br />Mr. Hopkins is the master of it all. He pulls us in with huge vigor that alternates with urgent intimacy. He’s so powerful when he wants to be that he chooses to make coiled self-containment his default mode. He’s seldom off screen, and each new scene has us wondering exactly what Anne wonders—what is her father up to today, or this hour, or minute? Who will he be now?<br />It’s not that Anthony is incoherent, only mercurial in a way that mercury would be if it could switch between bright and dark. In seductive mode he’s an irresistible charmer, and adept at dancing, which he says he used to do professionally, though Anne reminds him that he was an engineer. Yet the charm can turn frighteningly grotesque, giving way to hurt and rage in the time it takes for Anthony to turn his outwardly calm gaze inward. He’s marvelously manipulative, but he still can’t manipulate his surroundings, whatever they are—he isn’t necessarily where he thinks he is—into staying put long enough for him to feel safe. (Anne, portrayed poignantly by Ms. Colman, has her own delusional notions, mainly the possibility that her father will rally and get better.)<br />Watching “The Father” I thought of Arthur Kopit—not because of his signature play with the long title that begins “Oh Dad, Poor Dad,” but because of his remarkable “Wings,” a radio play set inside the disordered mind of a stroke victim who can no longer find the words for her thoughts. I also recalled Richard L. Gregory’s “Eye and Brain,” a book on visual perception. In it the author asks why, when we move our eyes, the world around us doesn’t move too; the answer has to do with the brain and retina working in concert to maintain a stable image.</td>

      <td>Intelligence agents attempt to solve an extraterrestrial mystery in NBC’s new sci-fi drama.</td>
      <td>It’s a dangerous thing to become infatuated with the first episode of a series, because pilots can be like first dates: Everything is candy and flowers, but what follows can be years of domestic drudgery, boredom and an acrimonious divorce. Still, it’s hard not to warm to NBC’s ambitious “Debris,” which may just sweep viewers off their feet.<br />This will be especially true of sci-fi fans, who have seen it all, maybe even imagined it all and might still be taken aback, not just by the unfolding details of the storyline but the way it plays hard-to-get. It’s in no rush to provide details, only mood. You don’t quite know what’s happening, so you lean in to learn more. It’s a common enough technique, but one very seductively executed by the show’s creator, J.H. Wyman (“Almost Human,” “Fringe”).<br />In it, “Debris” supposes that a spaceship of unknown origin has come apart, violently it seems, and the pieces are descending to Earth and causing mischief. And worse. Aggravating matters for U.S. intelligence agent Bryan Beneventi (Jonathan Tucker) and his British colleague, Finola Jones of MI6 (Riann Steele), is that the fragments of debris they’re hunting down have hit the black market and are being bought up by such dubious characters as Anson Ash (Scroobius Pip).<br />Why? The power of the pieces isn’t totally clear, of course. Future episodes will no doubt clarify. But the black, animated shards of spacecraft seem to tap into people’s grief, resurrecting their loved ones—in some ephemeral form, at least—and after using up one human’s emotions move on to another, as if changing batteries. The used-up human bodies are left levitating a foot in the air, seemingly alive and conscious but in suspended animation.<br />How is this working out for everyone? Not well. Both Bryan and Finola are like first responders in a pandemic—as susceptible to the influence of the debris as anyone else. They must avoid and resist. They also have specific motives for being where they are: Bryan, whom one assumes is CIA, has been in Afghanistan and is looking for something equally meaningful to do. Finola, whose late astrophysicist father had been “the first to be told the truth” about the pictures taken by the Hubble telescope of the “debris cloud” resulting from the mysterious cosmic event, has been born into the space-garbage game.</td>

      <td>In Lee Daniels’s feature, Andra Day stars as the celebrated vocalist, who was pursued by the federal government as part of its war on drugs.</td>
      <td>‘The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” starring Andra Day and streaming on Hulu, is a muddled chronicle of the persecution visited on the peerless jazz vocalist in the 1940s by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and its commissioner, Harry Anslinger. (He’s played coarsely by Garrett Hedlund.)<br />The thrust of the film is valid, and horrifying even now—perhaps especially now, when we’ve gained a deeper understanding of America’s racial history. Anslinger did pursue Billie, who was addicted to heroin, in order to racialize his agency’s so-called war on drugs. He was indeed obsessed with one of her signature songs, “Strange Fruit,” and tried to prevent her from singing it in public because its lyrics describe a lynching in shocking detail. And he sought to trap her with a sting operation led by Jimmy Fletcher (an appealing performance by Trevante Rhodes), a Black agent who did, by all accounts, fall in love with her. But none of that potentially powerful material has been organized into effective drama. It’s as if the filmmakers thought they’d have a full-fledged movie if they just kept recycling the “Strange Fruit” element often enough. (Lee Daniels directed from a screenplay by Suzan-Lori Parks, who adapted parts of the book “Chasing the Scream” by Johann Hari.)<br />The best thing about the production is the casting of Ms. Day in the title role. It’s no news that she’s a gifted singer, and her acting here swings between affecting and more than adequate, though there’s no way of knowing if her tentative moments are a result of Mr. Daniels’s clumsy and erratic direction. The problem with her performance lies in the constricting mimicry she’s been asked to do. Ms. Day gets the rasp and quiver, and she’s good on “Ain’t Nobody’s Business” because the relatively up-tempo song seems to release her from the mimic’s task. What’s missing in the slow ballads, including “Strange Fruit,” is what no other singer could ever touch, the uncut pain and piercing heartbreak born of Billie’s tragic childhood and early years.<br />Other aspects of the jazz scene as depicted are silly, and this is a story that can’t feel authentic without a convincing musical context. The tenor saxophone virtuoso Lester Young (Tyler James Williams), a formidable force in his own right and an essential part of Billie’s musical and personal life over several decades, appears to be a mostly affable, overgrown kid. A fleeting Louis Armstrong cameo is too foolish for words, let alone music, though no more so than the nonmusical figure of the actress and Billie’s friend Tallulah Bankhead (Natasha Lyonne), whose screen time is mercifully brief.<br />Glitches mar the history. Recording a V-Disc—a label created to provide music for U.S. military personnel during World War II—Billie tells her audience, “You’re fighting a real fight out there.” Where, though? It’s 1947, and the war has been over for two years. The physical production is patchy, indicating budgetary constraints. Grand Central Terminal in 1948 appears to be a really big room. But the film fails most importantly, almost inexplicably, at telling its story of governmental abuse and personal suffering in a coherent fashion. And the disorganization of Ms. Parks’s script is enhanced by a succession of montages that must have been put together to camouflage narrative gaps. (In the most annoying of them, Billie is on stage singing, but for some perverse reason we can’t hear her.) The running time is 130 minutes but feels like three hours because of the glacial pace and a consistent lack of dramatic energy. Billie was a user, for sure, but how to explain the drugginess of everyone else?</td>

      <td>Social-media platform aimed high with an ambitious set of targets Thursday</td>
      <td>Twitter  is a destination for fact and for fluff. Both are often taken with equal weight.<br />Elon Musk’s infamous 2018 tweet about taking Tesla private and venture capitalist Chamath Paliahapitiya’s tweet earlier this year signaling a California gubernatorial run come to mind. Neither panned out.<br />On Thursday, Twitter showed it can mic drop with the best of them. Its shares flew as much as 12% higher in advance of the company’s virtual investor day. In a regulatory filing Thursday morning, Twitter set forth three lofty goals for the next three years: By the end of 2023, the company said it would work to at least double its revenue, reach at least 315 million monetizable daily active users and essentially double one internal measure of the pace of features released. Now its investors have to hope the platform can back up its own proclamations better than those of its prominent users.<br />It is hard to know which of Twitter’s goals is most ambitious. Estimates compiled by Visible Alpha show Wall Street wasn’t expecting Twitter to hit that level of revenue and users until 2025 and 2027, respectively. Getting there by 2023 will require rapid innovation, which doesn’t come cheap: Twitter’s earlier outlook for this year called for 20% head-count growth and 25% growth in cost and expenses on an annual basis. Taken together, Twitter’s announcements sound something like the aggressive direction activist Elliott Management pushed for last year, when it advocated for Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey’s removal, asserting his attention was stretched too thin by leading two companies at once.<br />Mr. Dorsey’s ability to meet these new targets may determine whether he remains in or goes out at the top. His kickoff comments on Thursday were fitting, highlighting lack of speed, innovation and trust as Twitter’s three key weaknesses. Mr. Dorsey noted Twitter’s work to rebuild its ad server is already paying off, resulting in 31% ad revenue growth in the fourth quarter versus the year prior. And while it used to take six to 12 months to get a new product to its customers, Twitter is now working toward getting a new feature or product out in under a few weeks, he said.</td>

The resulting draw on power and natural gas supplies forced closures of plants that manufactured animal feed and processed milk, creating a calamity for a major meat- and fruit-producing region.<br />Chicken company  Sanderson Farms Inc.  said Thursday it had euthanized 545,000 chicks in Texas that couldn’t be shipped to farms from hatcheries due to hazardous road conditions. Chief Executive Joe Sanderson said another 455,000 chickens died due to frigid temperatures, shortages in water and feed, and collapsed buildings on farms. Another 703,000 hatching eggs were lost, he said.<br />“We deeply regret the losses incurred due to extraordinary circumstances,” Mr. Sanderson said on a conference call Thursday.<br />For Texas orange and grapefruit growers, who represent the third-largest citrus growing state, the wintry blast’s timing was catastrophic. The bitter cold likely destroyed 98% of the current Valencia orange crop and 55% of grapefruit, according to Dale Murden, a citrus grower and president of Texas Citrus Mutual, a farmer organization.</td>

Assets have followed, with investors plowing more than $100 million of fresh cash into the fund, pushing assets close to $800 million, according to FactSet.<br />It is the latest move for a fund that has found itself closely tied to the GameStop saga.

The next day, XRT tumbled nearly 10% as GameStop’s rally relented.<br />The fund ended up losing $506 million in assets, representing three-quarters of its total assets at the time. Redemptions were driven in part by wide discounts between the ETF’s share price and net asset value and a desire to get a hold of GameStop shares held by the fund, traders said.<br />The drama has reshaped XRT’s profile to some extent. The fund offers a way for investors to bet on a swath of the retail sector, typically offering roughly equal exposure to GameStop as to the likes of  Amazon.com Inc.,   Macy’s Inc.  and  Kohl’s Corp.</td>

      <td>Historic Caffè Florian, the city’s most opulent coffeehouse and unofficial hub for Carnival, was a gleeful time warp until Covid temporarily closed it last year</td>
      <td>For the Time Capsule series, we spotlight a cherished restaurant, hotel or landmark that’s changed remarkably little over the years. This week, we visit Caffè Florian in Venice, Italy.<br />Founded in 1720 as “Alla Venezia Trionfante” (Venice the Triumphant), the famous coffeehouse on the city’s Piazza San Marco, soon became known by its owner’s name, Florian. For decades, it served as Venice’s literary and philosophical hub, drawing any number of well-known eggheads, including Goethe, Charles Dickens and Marcel Proust. The cafe also played a role in several early political controversies: In 1796, for example, Venetian authorities shut it down temporarily, worried that pro-revolutionary Jacobins were congregating there, while in 1848, it was the favored meeting spot for Venetian separatists who wanted to see the city-state independent from the Austrian Empire. One of Florian’s most ornate rooms, the “Senate Hall,” redecorated in 1893, is filled with hidden, politically subversive visual references to Freemasonry. The current cafe’s sumptuous style—including ornately frescoed, gilded and mirrored rooms, like the “Oriental Salon,” and “Chinese Salon”—largely dates back to renovations carried out in the mid-19th century. The newest room, the Art Deco-inspired “Sala Liberty,” was added to the café in 1920.<br />In any normal February, Florian would double as the unofficial Studio 54 of the annual carnevale, hosting elaborately decked-out revelers within its no less extravagant front rooms. This year was to be particularly raucous—Florian celebrated its 300th birthday last December. But the pandemic, and the loss of nearly 12 months’ worth of tourism, has forced the cafe to temporarily close, with no clear reopening date. Fortunately, nostalgists craving prosecco in a Florian-branded glass can still buy them online. For now, however, both the institution’s staff and its regulars remain in limbo. According to assistant headwaiter Roberto Ferronato, a few costumed carnevale regulars still showed up this month, fully masked, to mourn outside the boarded-up windows. “Who could have imagined something that not even World Wars have caused,” said Mr. Ferronato, whose tenure dates to 1986, of the coronavirus-linked closure. “The bitterness that pervades me is great.” Michele Bronzin, a barman at Florian, calls it more than just a café. “It’s a medicine,” he said.<br />During its 300-year history, Florian has drawn some of the most notable figures in European history. Here are a few of the cafe’s most famous guests.<br />The Venetian nobleman and memoirist, known for the innumerable romantic conquests he recorded in his diary, visited Florian not merely for its fine coffee and pleasant atmosphere, but also for its clientele. It was the only café in the city to admit women, and thus prime territory for the Lothario.</td>

      <td>Industry executives expect U.S. push to address chip shortages will take years amid surging demand, complexity of supply chains</td>
      <td>President Biden’s pledge to fix the chip shortages hitting auto makers and others will take years to deliver, according to industry officials who are pressing the administration for long-desired support as demand for such processors continues to soar.<br />Chip industry executives welcomed Mr. Biden’s move but urged patience. “Supply chains take a long time to build up capability. Whatever comes out of it won’t come for years,” Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of  Nvidia Corp. —America’s biggest semiconductor company by value—said after the White House announced the executive action Wednesday aimed at addressing chip and other supply-chain bottlenecks. “There will be no immediate results,” Mr. Huang said.<br />The pandemic has supercharged demand for chips that go into everything from videogames and laptop computers to data centers, products that have become central to remote work and distance learning. Rebounding demand in other industries has exacerbated the scarcity of chip production capacity, industry executives have said.<br />“So much of society is run by that now,” Mr. Huang said Wednesday shortly after Nvidia posted record quarterly sales. “We need chips more than ever, which is great.”<br />But that demand surge has caught some industries out, particularly auto makers.  General Motors Co. ,  Ford Motor Co.  and  Volkswagen AG  have idled some of their production capacity as they await critical parts. Car makers are expected to produce around 700,000 fewer cars in the first three months of 2021 than earlier forecast because of chip shortages.</td>

Its revenue more than doubled to $1.3 billion in 2020 amid a bitcoin rally, while it posted a profit of $322 million. In 2019, when bitcoin trading was weak, it had a loss of $30 million on $533 million in revenue.<br />Coinbase had said in a December blog post that it filed confidentially with the SEC to go public. Shares will be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market via a direct listing under the ticker symbol COIN.<br />Direct listings differ from traditional initial public offerings in that companies take their shares to the stock market directly. Companies are able to save money that in a more traditional IPO would be shelled out to investment banks. This option to go public isn’t as common as traditional IPOs.</td>

      <td>SÃO PAULO—The market-friendly chief executive of Brazilian oil producer Petrobras said Thursday he would step down, paving the way for his replacement with an army general as President Jair Bolsonaro fights for greater control of the company.<br />Economist Roberto Castello Branco, who has won investors’ respect for shrinking Petrobras’s vast debt pile since taking the job at the beginning of 2019, said he would leave Brazil’s biggest company when his term ends on March 20.<br />His departure comes as Brazil’s right-wing president is pushing to install an army general at the helm of the oil producer after Mr. Castello Branco resisted the president’s calls to lower fuel prices. The row has raised fears among investors that Mr. Bolsonaro is seeking to force Petrobras to subsidize the country’s diesel and gasoline prices—a policy adopted under previous left-wing administrations that nearly bankrupted the company.<br />Mr. Castello Branco hit back at Mr. Bolsonaro Thursday, saying that fuel subsidies had been “disastrous” for the company in the past, costing it $40 billion. “If Brazil wants to be a free-market economy, you have to have a free market,” he said.<br />With elections looming next year, and calls growing in Congress for his impeachment over his handling of the pandemic, Mr. Bolsonaro has resorted ever more to populist moves to win over voters, political scientists said.</td>

      <td>Winston Churchill made the term famous, but ideological rivalries have driven geopolitics since Athens and Sparta.</td>
      <td>Historian Amanda Foreman searches the past for the origins of today’s world. Read previous columns here.<br />It was an unseasonably springlike day on March 5, 1946, when Winston Churchill visited Fulton, Missouri. The former British Prime Minister was ostensibly there to receive an honorary degree from Westminster College. But Churchill’s real purpose in coming was to urge the U.S. to form an alliance with Britain to keep the Soviet Union from expanding any further. Speaking before an august audience that included President Harry S. Truman, Churchill declared: “From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent.”<br />Churchill wasn’t the first person to employ the phrase “iron curtain” as a political metaphor. Originally a theatrical term for the safety barrier between the stage and the audience, by the early 20th century it was being used to mean a barrier between opposing powers. Nevertheless, “iron curtain” became indelibly associated with Churchill and with the defense of freedom and democracy.<br />This was a modern expression of an idea first articulated by the ancient Greeks: that political beliefs are worth defending. In the winter of 431-30 B.C., the Athenians were staggering under a devastating plague while simultaneously fighting Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. The stakes couldn’t have been higher when the great statesman Pericles used a speech commemorating the war dead to define the struggle in terms that every Athenian would understand.<br />As reported by the historian Thucydides, Pericles told his compatriots that the fight wasn’t for more land, trade or treasure; it was for democracy pure and simple. Athens was special because its government existed “for the many instead of the few,” guaranteeing “equal justice to all.” No other regime, and certainly not the Spartans, could make the same claim.</td>

Rand Paul of Kentucky started his questioning by mentioning “genital mutilation” to Dr. Rachel Levine, the nominee for assistant health secretary.<br />He then asked her during Thursday’s Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing if she supports hormone therapy or sex-reassignment therapy in minors with gender dysphoria. “We should be outraged that someone’s talking to a three year old about changing their sex,” said Mr. Paul, an ophthalmologist.<br />Mr. Paul added, “You give a woman enough testosterone to grow a beard, you think she’ll go back?”<br />Gender dysphoria—a conflict between a person’s sex assigned at birth and the gender with which a person identifies—is recognized by the American Psychiatric Association and other professional associations as a medical issue.</td>

Costco Chief Executive Craig Jelinek said at the hearing Thursday that Costco’s average wage for hourly workers is $24 an hour. Walmart’s average U.S. wage after recent increases take effect will be more than $15 an hour, the company has said.<br />“Although there’s a lot of external focus on starting wages and minimums, it is important to us that Costco employees have an opportunity to make more than $15 or $16,” he said, noting the company offers regular raises, bonuses and healthcare benefits. About 89% of workers are currently eligible for healthcare coverage, he said.</td>

      <td>What happens if financial regulators try to address the climate? Expect the usual corporate favoritism.</td>
      <td>The House Financial Services Committee holds a hearing Thursday on “Climate Change and Social Responsibility: Helping Corporate Boards and Investors Make Decisions for a Sustainable World.” This follows a flurry of Biden administration initiatives to thrust climate change to the forefront of financial regulation. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has announced her department will create a “climate hub,” complete with a “climate czar.” As Ms. Yellen stated at her confirmation hearing, the goal is to ensure that financial regulators “seriously look at assessing the risk to the financial system from climate change.” This plan will accomplish nothing to save the planet but will surely amount to a tax on borrowers and investors.<br />Ms. Yellen, congressional Democrats and others seem to believe that financial regulators have a unique ability to affect the environment. Last week Federal Reserve Board member Lael Brainard gave a speech titled “The Role of Financial Institutions in Tackling the Challenges of Climate Change,” in which she said, “Robust risk management, scenario analysis and forward planning can help ensure financial institutions are resilient to climate-related risks and well-positioned to support the transition to a more sustainable economy.” Her point is true as far as it goes, but it would be equally true for any other issue one might substitute for “climate-related.” Proponents of financial solutions don’t do nearly enough to explain how they would weigh the trade-offs of their policy approach.<br />Since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, U.S. financial regulation has focused on predicting, measuring and protecting against outsize risks to the financial system. Dodd-Frank created a new regulatory panel, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, for exactly that purpose. All this was premised on the idea that the Great Recession had led to an intolerable amount of taxpayer support for Wall Street that must never be repeated—hence the FSOC, which would require banks to be properly prepared for future calamities.<br />Unfortunately, the FSOC was unable to predict a global pandemic. By failing to require banks to hold enough capital to shore up the financial system last year, regulators left open the need for a more piecemeal but ultimately much larger bailout of American finance. Since last March, the Fed has provided unlimited liquidity not only to banks but also to businesses and even governments. This has been supplemented by Congress, whose profligate pandemic spending has added trillions of dollars to the national debt.<br />The point isn’t to chide financial regulators for responding to the pandemic. It’s to show that their usual policy tool kit is ill-suited to prevent unpredictable future threats, especially ones as uncertain as climate change.</td>

      <td>Companies don’t know how big or long-lasting the economic rebound might be. But they need to gear up for it.<br />The Commerce Department reported Thursday that orders for durable goods—long-lasting items that run the gamut from sheet metal to shipping containers—rose 3.4% in January from December, putting them 4.5% above their level of a year earlier, before the Covid-19 crisis struck. That jump indicates that a powerful “bullwhip effect”, where businesses’ efforts to rebuild inventories ripple through the economy, has taken hold.<br />Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft—a closely watched proxy for capital spending—rose a more muted 0.5% in January from December. That was up 9.1% from a year earlier, however, and in the months ahead the demand for capital goods might only build.<br />In considering capital spending plans, businesses face a bit of a dilemma. The decline in new Covid cases in recent weeks, the vaccine rollout and the likelihood of another round of government relief suggest that sales could surge.<br />But by how much, and in what areas? It seems probable that services spending will really pick up as Americans return to more normal activities, so service-sector businesses need to prepare for that. Goods spending might soften as a result—or maybe not. Moreover, the release of pent-up demand could carry the economy through the end of the year, but what sort of legs the rebound might have after that is unclear.</td>

      <td>Research shows that daydreaming and woolgathering are specialized mental functions with a unique pattern of brain waves.</td>
      <td>Psychologist Alison Gopnik explores new discoveries in the science of human nature. Read previous columns here.<br />There’s only one way to write: Just do it. But there seem to be a million ways not to write. I sit down to work on my column, write a sentence and—ping!—there’s a text with a video of my new baby grandson. One more sentence and I start ruminating about the latest virus variant, triggering a bout of obsessive Covid worry. Cut it out! I tell myself, and write one more sentence, and then I’m staring blankly out the window, my mind wandering: What was it with that weird movie last night? Should I make chicken pilaf or lamb tagine for dinner?<br />These different kinds of thinking are the subject of a paper I co-authored recently in the journal PNAS, which has an interesting back story. Zachary Irving is a brilliant young philosopher now at the University of Virginia, well-trained—as philosophers have to be—at thinking about thinking. He is especially interested in the kind of unconstrained thought we have when our mind wanders. Is mind-wandering really distinct from other kinds of thought, like simple distraction or obsessive rumination? And why do we do it so much?<br />Young children daydream a lot, so Zach came to visit my lab at Berkeley, where we study children’s thinking. Neuroscience has mainly focused on goal-directed, task-oriented thinking, but what is your brain doing when your mind wanders? To answer that question, we worked with Julia Kam, now at the University of Calgary, and Robert Knight to design an experiment that involved giving 45 people a tedious but demanding task: pressing an arrow when a cue appeared on the screen. The participants did this more than 800 times for 40 minutes, and at random intervals we asked them to report what they were thinking. Were they thinking about the task or something else? Were they obsessing about a single topic or were their minds freely wandering?<br />Meanwhile, the participants’ brain waves were being measured with electroencephalography or EEG. The study found that different types of thinking correspond to different brain wave patterns. Like earlier researchers, we found that brain waves are different when you pay attention to a task and when you get distracted. But we found that different types of distraction also have different brain signatures. We compared what happens when your mind is captured by an internal obsession like worrying about Covid, and what happens when it wanders freely.</td>

      <td>Armed forces call for Nikol Pashinyan’s resignation amid anger over last year’s Russian-brokered cease-fire with Azerbaijan</td>
      <td>Armenia’s prime minister accused the country’s armed forces of plotting a coup to remove him, plunging the Russian ally deeper into turmoil after a bruising conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan last fall.<br />Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on Thursday fired the military’s top commander and called on his supporters to take to the streets in a show of force. The military had earlier added its voice to growing demands across Armenia that Mr. Pashinyan step down amid a growing outcry over his handling of last year’s conflict, in which parts of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh returned to Azeri control after Russia negotiated a cease-fire.<br />“The army submits to the people and the prime minister,” Russian news agency Interfax reported Mr. Pashinyan as saying while walking with supporters in Yerevan, the capital. The military responded by saying it issued its resignation call to reflect the position of top officers who had lost confidence in Mr. Pashinyan.<br />Witnesses said they saw military planes in the sky above the city.<br />The tumult reflects broad anger against the terms of the cease-fire over Nagorno-Karabakh, which had been held by ethnic Armenians since the 1990s despite officially lying within Azerbaijan’s boundaries. It could also add to the instability besetting a number of other former Soviet republics, including neighboring Georgia, where police detained the country’s main opposition leader this week, sparking rebukes from the U.S. and Europe. Further complicating the regional balance of power, Turkey has undermined Russia’s traditional influence in the South Caucasus by building stronger military and diplomatic ties with Azerbaijan.</td>

      <td>Mary H.K. Choi, author of the forthcoming novel ‘Yolk,’ reflects on her co-dependent cold-weather relationship with the rayon-blend long-johns</td>
      <td>PEER INTO MY apartment from the apartment across the street to catch me unaware, en dishabille, and you’ll find me in Uniqlo Heattech. From the months of October to May, I am blotted out from head-to-toe in Japan’s finest rayon/poly/acrylic long-johns, spidering from room to room like some middle-aged stagehand or deeply prosaic mime. Rising before the alarm, shucking off pajamas, counting out knee bends; toe touches, climbing into a sweatsuit, huddling into my house coat, breakfasting, attempting correspondences, shambling about my day and muttering to myself—all of this is done as a Heattech never-nude. The only time I am absent my protective sheath is for a desultory shower and the attendant ritual of observing an astonishing volume of emollient disappear into my body and face.<br />Hygge, Fair Isle, Qiviut, toddies. None of this holds any allure for me. I am bad at winter. I don’t like it. Admitting that may guarantee me the cool reception normally reserved for those who conspiratorially reveal that they’re no good at consequences or can’t abide waiting in line. But if the casual dude in shorts, flip flops and a Patagonia vest in subzero weather has taught me anything, it’s that I’m just not epigenetically built for this.<br />The first time I saw snow fall out of the sky I was 22. I grew up in balmy Hong Kong, where toilet paper in the morning is often wet to the touch. Then I moved to south-central Texas, where six months of the year are spent in triple-digit heat that spoils milk in the car ride home. Before moving to New York, I’d only known snow to be sprinkled into water and encased in glass globes. It seemed quixotic and purely cosmetic. It may as well have been glitter.<br />They say that trauma remains in the body. That your assigned meatsuit keeps score. My first winter in New York—the North American blizzard of 2003, also known as the Presidents Day Blizzard or PDII for meteorology enthusiasts—found me shuddering violently in waist-high snow in Red Hook, Brooklyn, waiting for a bus that never came. I wore a laughable jacket from  Burlington Coat Factory  and had nylon Nike Cortezes on my feet. Snow, I learned, was wet. By the time I’d hurled my ice-stiffened clothes onto the bathroom floor, scalding water needling my mottled, purpled gooseflesh, I’d also learned that sunk-cost fallacies, as they relate to New York transit, may well get you killed.<br />Retellings of this harrowing tale didn’t elicit the sympathy one would expect. I was chided by experienced, hardier folk—people who snowboard or “grew up in Chicago”—that I needed base layers. I went with the first kind that popped up on Google. Now, to protect myself against inhospitable climes, I conservatively need four pairs of Heattech in rotation, two on ice. Part of it is function but largely it’s pathology, and whenever I open a ruthlessly Kondo’d drawer to peer at the tender little bundles of lifesaving warmth, I’m struck with profound relief and gratitude. I’m partial to the regular weight for the leaf-changing months, but from Boxing Day onward it’s strictly “extra warm.” I machine wash cold and line dry since the extra warm has a propensity to pill. I prefer the men’s tops—the women’s seem cut exclusively for narrow, short-trunked bodies—and because I find the women’s overly scooped neckline unserious. I get mine all in black because I enjoy a matching pair as the only remaining sartorial consideration I’ll humor on any day without sunlight. And while it may not speak to the haberdashering aspirations of Steve Jobs in Issey Miyake turtlenecks or Zuck in Brunello Cucinelli T-shirts, decision fatigue is real. I may not be personally responsible for a ruinously ambitious tech behemoth, but I did recently switch from English muffins to steel-cut oats, which feels like enough resolutions until next quarter.</td>

The tech companies, and tech advocates, respond that they already boost the media companies’ revenue by sending them tens of billions of website visits monthly, and that free linking is the internet’s lifeblood.</td>

The greenback has weakened against the backdrop of a feeble U.S. economy and low interest rates, and as investors have moved money into riskier assets around the world.<br />Although the yuan rallied to the strongest level since mid-2018 to 6.46 per dollar, Beijing’s official response has been relatively mild so far. Since last fall, it has made it easier for traders to bet on a weaker yuan, and allowed more domestic financial institutions to move money out of the country to invest in foreign securities.<br />Economists say that Beijing appears to be comfortable with a stronger yuan now in part because it could help rebalance China’s economy toward consumption and make it cheaper for China to import commodities and chips.<br />“China will evolve into a consumption-driven economy, which means they don’t have to keep an undervalued currency like a typical emerging export-oriented economy,” said Ju Wang, a Hong Kong-based senior FX strategist at  HSBC .  “Beijing is already shifting towards this new model, which means they see a fundamentally stronger currency as more beneficial than harmful for the economy.”</td>

      <td>Small landlords that rely on rental income for their retirement are vulnerable to eviction bans</td>
      <td>Real estate has been touted by financial advisers as a stable investment for those seeking a passive source of income in retirement. But instead of boosting their income, some retirees who invested in residential rental properties are now losing money due to eviction moratoria resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Faced with tenants who can’t pay rent, these mom-and-pop landlords are finding their hands tied under the governmental orders, making them especially vulnerable and, in some cases, at risk of losing the properties securing their retirement.<br />Here’s what you need to know about the moratoria and what you can, and can’t, do when your tenants don’t pay.<br />In January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extended the existing eviction moratorium to March 31, 2021. This moratorium prevents landlords from evicting tenants for nonpayment, although tenants can still be evicted for reasons other than not paying rent. To be protected from eviction, tenants must provide a written declaration to their landlord, attesting that they have sought government rental assistance, will earn no more than $99,000 in annual income (or $198,000 if filing a joint tax return), cannot pay their full rent due to loss of income, work hours or extraordinary medical expenses, have used best efforts to make timely partial payments, and would become homeless if evicted. All rental properties are covered, but the CDC moratorium doesn’t apply in any state or local areas that have their own moratorium with the same or greater protection. In those areas, state or local law prevails.<br />Gregory Scott Brown, senior vice president, government affairs, of the National Apartment Association, says that if rent remains unpaid when the moratorium expires, landlords will still need to go through the eviction process to regain possession of their unit. Some eviction laws allow tenants to avoid eviction by paying off the rent debt and some judges in eviction proceedings decide if tenants are liable for back rent. They could rule that tenants don’t have to repay before eviction. Mr. Brown suggests that whenever possible, landlords try to work out a repayment plan with the tenant to keep them in place.<br />Don’t. Don’t shut off utilities either. “The only recourse to regain possession of a unit is through the courts and the eviction process,” says Bob Pinnegar, president and chief executive officer of the National Apartment Association. Take the law into your own hands, and you might be subject to civil or criminal penalties, depending on the jurisdiction. In New York, a court may even allow the tenant back into the apartment, says Howard Poch, a New York City attorney who represents landlords and tenants.</td>

In an ideal scenario, the brewer would be able to mop up some of the excess stock by buying them out, but high borrowings restrict its options.<br />On Thursday, the world’s biggest beer maker said sales in the three months through December increased by 4.5% compared with the same period of 2019, suggesting a continued recovery from the pandemic-related problems of last spring. However, AB InBev’s shares fell 5% in early trading as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization missed forecasts and management gave cautious guidance for 2021.<br />But there is another reason for investors to be wary about the brewer this year. In October, restrictions on the sale of shares worth around 17% of AB InBev’s market value will be lifted. The stock is mainly owned by Marlboro cigarette maker  Altria  and Colombia’s Santo Domingo family. Both were major shareholders in SABMiller when the Anglo-South African brewer was taken over by AB InBev in 2016. The duo opted for a mix of cash and shares in the combined company as payment, and agreed not to sell for five years.<br />At the time, it looked like a great deal. The two got stock in AB InBev at a 50% premium to SABMiller’s undisturbed share price in dollar terms, according to Bernstein analyst Trevor Stirling.

      <td><br />As lawmakers and security researchers continue to unravel the SolarWinds hack, some are growing more frustrated with  Amazon.com Inc.,  saying the cloud-computing giant should be more publicly forthcoming about its knowledge of the suspected Russian cyberattack.<br />There are no indications that  Amazon ’s  systems were directly breached, but hackers used its sprawling cloud-computing data centers to launch a key part of the attack, according to security researchers. The operation has been described as one of the worst instances of cyber espionage in the nation’s history.<br />While cybersecurity experts say it is nearly impossible to prevent hackers from misusing cloud services, as is alleged to have occurred in this case, they also say that Amazon is likely sitting on critical information that could shed light on the scope of the attacks and the tactics used by the cybercriminals. U.S. authorities say the intruders are likely Russian intelligence agents.<br />Amazon has shared this information privately with the U.S. government, but unlike other technology companies, it has balked at making it public.</td>

      <td>U.S. farmers are expected to plant a record amount of acres this year to take advantage of high agricultural prices after years of tough market conditions.<br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects that farmers will plant 182 million acres of corn and soybeans in 2021. That is an all-time high and up roughly eight million acres from last year—driven by a jump in soybean acreage, which is expected to rise nearly seven million acres from last year.<br />“If realized, this would approach the highest planted soybean area figure on record,” said Mac Marshall, vice president of market intelligence for the United Soybean Board. That record dates back to 2017, when farmers planted 90.2 million acres of soybeans, according to USDA data.<br />Behind the increase lies a sharp rise in soybean prices over the past eight months—69% since June 1, with the most-active contract on the Chicago Board of Trade trading at $14.26 per bushel on Wednesday, the highest level since July 2014.<br />Prices have been lifted by surging demand for U.S. soybeans in China, where the country continues to rebuild a hog herd that was decimated by African swine fever in 2019. As of last week, Chinese buyers had purchased 35.9 million tons of U.S. soybeans since the start of September—up nearly 24 million tons from the same period a year earlier.</td>

      <td>A car accident in California has golf fans pondering a legend’s future, on the course and off</td>
      <td>Golf can wait. In those early, gray moments Tuesday, when we didn’t know much about the accident involving Tiger Woods—when all we had was some harrowing overhead footage of a crumpled SUV off the side of a winding Southern California road—it was possible to really let your mind wander and worry. Now we know more: Woods is hurt, with broken bones in his right leg and foot, and now has a rod inserted after surgery, but overall, the news is good, very good, considering how it looked at first.<br />Still: golf can wait.<br />Priorities will shift. That’s what happens when something like this occurs. Attention will be paid to Woods’s recovery and rehabilitation, and there will naturally be curiosity about his potential return to his sport—short answer: nobody knows for sure—but his playing status feels like a minor diversion compared with the relief of the big picture. Woods is lucky, and those of us who have loved watching him play golf have to feel a little lucky, too.<br />The sport can wait. “When Tiger wants to talk about golf, we’ll talk about golf,” the PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said.<br />That sounds like the right perspective. There will be a compulsion to accelerate things: that’s our culture, hurry it along, speculate without all of the information, and turn someone else’s life into a daily drama for our own entertainment. There’s going to be a temptation to draw parallels to golf great Ben Hogan’s wreck and recovery, and even though it’s a very different time and set of circumstances, we won’t be able to help ourselves. This has always been a media affliction, but now it’s everywhere. We want it when we want it, and we’re all terribly impatient for clean narratives and quick answers.</td>

      <td>LONDON—The U.K. has become a testing ground for how a more-contagious and possibly deadlier coronavirus variant spreads through communities, displacing its less-transmissible ancestors and complicating vaccine rollouts and the lifting of lockdowns.<br />The variant has now been identified in more than 70 countries and 40 U.S. states, and its advance in Britain could help scientists understand its likely trajectory in the U.S. These charts show the spread of the variant around the U.K. and what British scientists are learning about it—including its higher transmissibility and lethality.<br />“Increasingly, since this version of the virus was discovered we’ve really been running two separate pandemics,” said Jason Leitch, national clinical director for Scotland. “That is a warning to other countries.”<br />British scientists detected the new variant in November, and in early December traced its first appearance in the U.K. to the southern English county of Kent, in September. The country was in lockdown in November to suppress a deadly wave of infection that had been building since the fall. British public health officials were mystified by the virus’s ongoing spread in southern England despite those restrictions.<br />When scientists examined the variant’s genome, they found an unusually large number of mutations, some of which pointed to the possibility the new variant could spread more rapidly than pre-existing versions. Further sequencing—and a testing quirk that served as a reliable proxy for the variant’s presence—revealed how quickly the variant rose to dominance.</td>

Vanguard Group is betting more singularly on the Chinese consumer.<br />The Malvern, Pa., firm told some of China’s biggest state investors last year that it would exit its China institutional business and return the billions of dollars managed for them. Instead, the world’s second-largest asset manager is relying on a partnership with Ant Group Co., China’s biggest digital financial firm and an affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., as a main route into China.<br />Vanguard hopes the venture will give it reach to the roughly one billion users of Ant’s payments service, Alipay—and perhaps a channel to sell Vanguard’s funds later. This move plays to a broader growth plan for Vanguard.<br />The firm that built a $7.2 trillion asset-management empire on the back of low-cost index funds is betting growth will come from dispensing financial advice at a fraction of rivals’ prices.<br />But, as Vanguard looks to expand in China, Chief Executive Tim Buckley must also convince Beijing that his firm is as committed to the country as rivals, even after it recently turned away business from some of its big state institutions. Vanguard must also deal with a recent complication: Ant is now revamping its entire business after being warned by Beijing regulators about some of its practices and having its initial public offering scrapped.</td>

      <td>Americans drinking more hard seltzer through the pandemic helped beer giant  Anheuser-Busch InBev SA  partly offset a continuing slump in sales of Budweiser and Bud Light.<br />Hard seltzers—essentially flavored alcoholic sparkling water—have emerged as one of the hottest parts of the booze market in recent years, tempting more health-conscious drinkers away from beer. In response, AB InBev launched Bud Light Seltzer early last year, has since invested in several new flavors of the brand and recently rolled out Michelob Ultra Hard Seltzer.<br />On Thursday, the world’s biggest brewer said those efforts were paying off, as sales at its “beyond beer” unit, which includes hard seltzer, ready-to-drink cocktails and other products, grew double digits to top over $1 billion.<br />That helped AB InBev report overall fourth-quarter sales growth on an organic basis—which strips out currency moves and acquisitions and divestitures—of 4.5%. Revenue on a reported basis dropped to $12.77 billion from $13.33 billion a year earlier. Net profit jumped to $2.27 billion from $114 million a year earlier, when results were hit by higher finance costs.<br />AB InBev was late to jump on the seltzer wagon, originally driven mainly by White Claw, owned by Mike’s Hard Lemonade Co., and Truly Spiked & Sparkling, made by  Boston Beer Co.  Now, though, the drinks giant sees seltzers as a priority and key way to win back defecting beer drinkers. It said Thursday that its hard seltzer brands grew at double the rate of the industry last year, helped by the launch of Bud Light Seltzer.</td>

      <td>Reopening will be a blessing for U.S. restaurants, but not necessarily for restaurant stock prices</td>
      <td>The end of the Covid-19 emergency will be a godsend for the U.S. restaurant industry. But in the near term, it might not be as good for restaurant shareholders as one might expect.<br />A year after the first coronavirus-fueled market selloff, investors seem to love restaurant stocks as much as Americans love to dine out. And Wall Street has been more than willing to give the industry a pass as Covid-19 and accompanying government restrictions have devastated restaurant traffic and hammered sales.<br />Brinker International ,  which owns Chili’s, is up about 90% over the past year, thanks in part to the successful launch of virtual-chicken-wing concept It’s Just Wings.  Darden Restaurants ,  owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, is up 24% over that same time, while  Cheesecake Factory  has rallied 42%. All three stocks have at least tripled since the pandemic lows of last March. Meanwhile, business continues to be slow; companies have lately reported comparable sales declines on the order of 12% to 22% from a year earlier.<br />There was a sound logic for investors to look past the business weakness. Wall Street typically doesn’t give much weight to one-time financial events, and the impact of a global pandemic would seem to be the mother of such one-time situations. Big chains have also been able to access cheap financing to help get through the lean months. A reopening after months of closed dining rooms means there should be significant pent-up demand, at least in theory. That moment could be coming soon: About 45 million Americans have received at least one dose of a vaccine, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.<br />Meanwhile, consumers have plenty of cash to spend on an evening out, and fresh stimulus checks could soon be on the way. As a bonus, the need to adapt to a socially distanced business model resulted in better off-premise sales models and other investments that should pay off down the road. Massive industrywide comparable sales growth seems likely in the months ahead.</td>

      <td>Employers say eliminating $2.13-an-hour subminimum wage for workers receiving tips could cost jobs and raise prices; plan’s advocates say it would provide consistent income</td>
      <td>How restaurants pay workers would be upended by President Biden’s proposal to raise the minimum wage.<br />The plan, under consideration in Congress, would lift the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from the current level of $7.25 an hour for all workers that has been in place since 2009. The proposal also would eliminate a subminimum wage of as little as $2.13 an hour for millions of workers such as servers or bartenders who receive tips. Both changes would be phased in over several years and largely eliminate a patchwork of state wage laws.<br />In most states, businesses can pay tipped workers less than others, so long as those employees earn at least the minimum wage after tips are added. Under the proposal, restaurants in 32 states could have increased direct labor costs of between $10 and $13 an hour, with businesses in several more states facing increases of $5 to $10 an hour. Seven states, including California, don’t have a subminimum wage for tipped workers.<br />Worker advocates say eliminating the tipped wage would mean servers and others would have more consistent income and wouldn’t potentially need to ask for more pay when tips fall short. The restaurant industry says the existing tip structure means many jobs already pay well above the minimum wage, and that the Biden plan would put jobs at risk while restaurants are still hurting from the pandemic.<br />Senate Democrats are divided over the proposal, with some lawmakers pressing for a smaller increase and others raising concerns about the proposal’s approach to tipped wages. Some Republicans have indicated support for a wage increase, but haven’t embraced the Democrats’ plan.</td>

These officers must acknowledge complaints within a day and resolve them within 15.<br />Social media firms must take down material involving explicit sexual content within 24 hours of being flagged. Firms must also appoint officers and contact people—who live in India—to coordinate with law enforcement agencies and address complaints. Some firms must also help identify the “first originator” of some messages, the rules say.<br />“We appreciate the proliferation of social media in India,” Ravi Shankar Prasad, India’s minister of electronics and information technology, said Thursday. “We want them to be more responsible and more accountable,” he said.<br />The rules are New Delhi’s latest move to assert control over global tech firms that have experienced breakneck growth in a country of more than 1.3 billion. The regulations also come during monthslong farmers’ protests against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, which have sparked fierce debate on social media. They have emerged as Mr. Modi’s stiffest political challenge since he assumed power in 2014.</td>

      <td>The auto makers have decided they can work better together as separate companies, a year after announcing a planned merger</td>
      <td>Chinese car maker  Geely  has called off a deal to create the country’s first truly global auto firm. It wants the benefits of the merger without doing one—the idea of integration without a sale presents certain advantages, but it also looks like an attempt to satisfy fussy shareholders. It remains to be seen if the path of least resistance is actually the best one.<br />Geely and Volvo, which share the same largest shareholder, scrapped their plan to merge Wednesday. Instead, they will combine their powertrain operations including internal combustion engines, transmissions and hybrid systems to serve both car makers, as well as outside customers. Geely and Volvo will develop electric vehicles and self-driving technologies together and jointly source components including batteries and electric motors. In short, the two companies hope to achieve similar synergies that would be achieved by a merger. One year ago, they said they were in talks to formally combine.<br />Investors seem to like the idea: Geely’s Hong Kong-listed shares gained 2.7% Thursday. The two companies already share some technologies and a manufacturing platform. Even more integrated operation will help further shed costs and combine resources to tackle the next big thing in car-making: electric vehicles.<br />So why not merge outright then? Volvo’s chief executive officer said ditching the merger allows them to maintain full focus on growth without worrying about organizational disputes or power struggles arising from the combination. Having a price both sides could agree on is probably tough too. Though Zhejiang Geely, owned by Geely’s chairman Li Shufu, is the largest shareholder of both, a potential merger would likely need the approval from Geely’s minority shareholders. They probably would reject paying too high a price for Volvo, as that means dilution to their shareholdings.<br />Mr. Li, who owns a 97.8% stake in Volvo through Zhejiang Geely, probably doesn’t want to sell too cheaply either. As the auto market has recovered, he may be able to get a better price going to the market. Zhejiang Geely postponed its plan to list Volvo three years ago as trade tensions hit auto stocks.</td>

But it will be hampered by the growing difficulties factories face in meeting Western consumers’ appetite for goods.<br />Last April, as large parts of the global economy were in a deep freeze, economists at the World Trade Organization said global trade flows could suffer the largest peacetime decline since the Great Depression, possibly falling by as much as a third.<br />Instead, global trade flows fell just 5.3% last year, according to new data from the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, after having returned to pre-pandemic levels by November. That recovery required less than half the time it took flows to return to their previous level following the global financial crisis.<br />Demand for personal protection equipment, including face masks, soared. Working and schooling from home boosted demand for computers. Efforts to avoid risky public transport systems in cities boosted demand for bicycles. Many splashed out on new kitchens and furnishings. Huge government stimulus in wealthy countries has only turbocharged such demand.</td>

      <td>Strong results were offset by worries about chip-production constraints and growing opposition to the Arm deal</td>
      <td>Nvidia  was truly in some uncharted territory with its fiscal fourth-quarter results Wednesday, in that the chip maker is facing concerns that even great numbers alone won’t soothe.<br />And the numbers were great. Revenue for the quarter ended Jan. 31 soared 61% year-over-year to $5 billion, beating Wall Street’s forecast. That was thanks to booming sales of graphics processors in both the company’s videogame and data-center businesses, the latter of which managed to surpass the record-breaking sum of the previous quarter despite widespread expectations that giant cloud-computing companies would ease back on the spending throttle. Nvidia also projected total revenue of $5.3 billion for the current quarter—about 18% above the $4.5 billion analysts were expecting.<br />But Nvidia’s shares ticked up only slightly after the results, before turning down 2% later in the after-hours session. Concerns over the global chip shortage were one factor. As one of the world’s largest “fabless” chip companies, Nvidia is at the mercy of major producers like  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  and  Samsung .  But production across the semiconductor supply chain has been unable to keep up with demand, causing shortages across industry groups. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said on the company’s conference call Wednesday that he expects constraints to continue this year.<br />Nvidia is also facing growing opposition to its proposed acquisition of chip designer Arm Holdings, which is still awaiting regulatory approval and is now being investigated in the U.K. Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet Inc.—two major buyers of Nvidia’s data-center chips—have now both voiced their opposition. Nvidia maintained Wednesday its expected time frame of 18 months from the deal’s announcement in September to its closing, but skepticism on Wall Street has grown. Citing the growing opposition, Citigroup analyst Atif Malik wrote on Feb. 14 that “we lower our confidence to 25% from 60% that the deal can close.”<br />Even with those concerns, Nvidia should have a strong year ahead. Wall Street expects revenue to grow 20% for the fiscal year ending next January. And Nvidia said Wednesday it has taken steps to keep growing demand from cryptocurrency miners from causing shortages of its gaming chips, mainly by technical measures designed to limit the usefulness of gaming cards for crypto mining. This should help prevent a repeat of what happened in 2018, when a crash in crypto prices hurt Nvidia’s sales as miners dumped their cards on the secondary market. Crypto may be less of a problem for Nvidia this time, but production constraints and slow M&A approvals show how much of the company’s near-term story is dominated by matters out of its control.</td>

      <td>Developed-world governments sold bonds in record volumes in the first year of the coronavirus pandemic, but their borrowing costs fell</td>
      <td>Rich countries’ governments borrowed $18 trillion from bond markets in 2020—more than ever before—but their borrowing costs hit a record low, due to a big rise in bond purchases by central banks, as well as a lack of concern about public debt levels among private investors.<br />The jump in government bond sales during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic was almost twice that recorded when the global financial crisis struck, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development research body. In contrast to the years that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, there was no rise in bond yields in 2020, and governments faced a lower interest bill than they did before the financial crisis, the OECD said.<br />The massive borrowing in much of the developed world reflects the unique circumstances of the pandemic, which has required unprecedented levels of aid for workers and businesses affected by social-distancing measures. But it also shows a more relaxed attitude toward government deficits among policy makers, investors and economists than a decade ago.<br />“It’s a lesson learned from the financial crisis that governments shouldn’t pull back their fiscal support early,” said Fatos Koc, a policy analyst at the OECD.<br />In its annual report on government borrowing, the OECD said its 37 member governments sold $18 trillion in bonds during 2020, which helped cover the cost of supporting households and businesses through the pandemic, as well as high medical costs.</td>

      <td>Higher Treasury yields create opportunities to pick up interest income, but benefit for shares may be limited without more loan demand</td>
      <td>The move in Treasurys has been greeted like an all-you-can eat buffet by bank investors starved for yield. But they might not want to gorge themselves all at once.<br />As the 10-year Treasury yield has jumped so far this year from around 0.9% to about 1.4%, U.S. big-bank stocks have risen over 20%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 4.5%. Banks’ move is justified in many respects, as higher long-term rates are fundamentally good for their lending business. And it is easy to see more room to run, as banks are still lagging behind the market overall since the pandemic began last year, and are historically still somewhat cheap relative to the S&P 500 on a price-to-earnings basis: about 34% cheaper, versus about 30% from 2014 to 2019.<br />But a closer look at how exactly banks might benefit from higher rates may put a damper on any emerging euphoria. What is unique about banks right now is that they are sitting on a mountain of unusually cheap deposits from consumers and businesses with a glut of savings. That has resulted in a big pile of cash sitting at the Federal Reserve earning nothing, which can in theory be rotated into securities. This is a very profitable potential trade: Analysts at Autonomous Research figure that big banks rotating just their present excess cash at the Fed into securities in 2021 and adding 1 percentage point of yield would increase the next year’s net interest income by 2.5% on average and earnings per share by roughly 5%.<br />But while banks’ actions in past cycles have sometimes been accelerants to rising rates, now they may be something of a curb.<br />For example, in the past banks have sometimes been sellers of mortgage-backed securities as rates across the board rise because the slower rate of repayment extends the duration of those bonds—a kind of risk banks don’t typically want. They worry about matching the duration of those assets to deposits, which could mean having to raise deposit rates.</td>

      <td>FAA has focused on ramped-up inspections since the failures; changes to airplane parts could require lengthy design and testing</td>
      <td>Boeing Co.  was planning to strengthen protective engine covers on its 777 jets months before a pair of recent serious failures, including one near Denver last weekend, according to an internal Federal Aviation Administration document.<br />The plane maker and regulator had been discussing potential fixes even longer—for about two years, according to people familiar with the matter. The talks began after two failures in 2018, one on a 777 operated by  United Airlines Holdings Inc.  and the other on a Southwest Airlines Co. 737.<br />Because potential modifications to 777 external engine covers, commonly known as cowlings, had various shortcomings, “Boeing has decided to redesign the fan cowl instead of trying to modify existing fan cowls to address both the structural strength concerns” and moisture issues, according to the internal FAA document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />“Boeing will be manufacturing new fan cowls and providing service instructions for operators to remove and replace the fan cowls,” according to the document, part of a routine Aug. 6, 2020, update on efforts under way at the agency’s Seattle-area offices. Boeing and the FAA declined to comment on the engine-cover plan’s status Wednesday.<br />Such changes to airplane parts can require years of design, testing and regulatory approvals. Some aviation-safety experts and regulators have been growing increasingly concerned about whether engine covers are robust enough to withstand the impact of a fan blade’s breaking off and shooting outward during flights.</td>

The Labor Department will publish the latest data at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday.<br />The four-week moving average, which smooths out week-to-week fluctuations, was 833,000 in the week ended Feb. 13, within the roughly 750,000 to 850,000 range that has held since last October and above the pre-pandemic peak.<br />The recent data is broadly consistent with a labor market that has been stuck near neutral this winter, while other readings of the economy have pointed to a pickup.<br />Jobless claims are closely watched by policy makers and investors about the direction of the jobs market and overall economy, but winter storms that hit Texas and elsewhere could affect layoff trends in the short term. The storms, which caused widespread power outages and disruptions, could create temporary unemployment for some workers and may have made it difficult for people to file claims and for state governments to process them.</td>

Treasury yields are rising and stock-market investors are starting to shift from high-growth tech companies toward companies like airlines that will benefit from an economic rebound.<br />But one corner of the Treasury market suggests that a coming bump in U.S. inflation will run out of steam swiftly. This has implications for fans of gold or cryptocurrencies who fret about runaway inflation.<br />Investors’ inflation expectations can be seen in Treasury markets by looking at the difference between the yields on ordinary Treasurys and the yields on inflation protected Treasurys, known as TIPS. This difference is called the break-even rate.<br />The difference between five-year Treasury and TIPS yields shows break-even inflation expectations have risen to nearly 2.4% in recent days—the highest level since May 2011, implying inflation is set to pick up.<br />But there is more going on below the surface. Shorter-term break-even rates are higher than longer-term ones, an extremely rare situation—known as an inversion of the break-even curve. This forecasts a spike in inflation that then falls away.</td>

The latest loss is expected to bring the company’s full-year deficit to $3.84 billion, more than its losses in the previous four years combined.<br />Airbnb saw revenue evaporate in the early months of the health crisis. That started to change as scores of people used the platform to plan nearby trips in the summer. Fourth-quarter revenue is expected to fall 33% to $747 million from $1.06 billion a year earlier. Full-year revenue is expected to fall 32%.<br />Airbnb has been the bellwether of an otherwise battered travel industry. Chief Executive Brian Cheskysuccessfully pivoted the company’s strategy to focus on rural stays while hotels in big cities suffered. At the same time, he cut a quarter of staff, paused noncore operations and slashed the company’s hefty marketing budget to keep expenses down.<br />The uptick in revenue, combined with deep cost cuts, helped Airbnb turn a third-quarter profit, boosting investor confidence ahead of its initial public offering in December. Airbnb shares doubled in their market debut and had climbed nearly threefold from their IPO price through Wednesday’s close. The San Francisco home-sharing company’s results are expected Thursday after market hours.</td>

      <td>The number of publicly traded companies is rising after a two-decade slump, a shift that highlights how businesses are clamoring to capitalize on the buoyant investor sentiment that has carried everything from stocks to bitcoin to record highs.<br />Last year’s increase in the number of companies listed on U.S. exchanges was the largest since the late-1990s dot-com bubble. The total is expected to surge even more this year as hundreds of companies tap everyday investors, according to data compiled by University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter.<br />That marks a key change because the number of listed companies fell steadily for 20 years, declining from roughly 8,500 in 1997 to 4,500 in 2017, as the internet bubble burst, startups raised huge sums through venture-capital and private-equity firms, and mergers and acquisitions shrunk the pool of public companies. After edging higher in 2018 and 2019, the number of listed companies surged by nearly 200 last year during a record stretch in the market for initial public offerings.<br />Shares in companies such as dating-app operator  Bumble Inc.,  online real-estate rental business  Airbnb Inc.  and digital food-delivery provider  DoorDash Inc.  soared recently after traditional IPOs. A torrid stretch in the market for special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, is adding to the frenzy. Also called blank-check firms, SPACs are shell companies that list on an exchange with the sole purpose of acquiring a private company to take it public. The private company, typically a startup, then gets the SPAC’s place in the stock market.<br />Some companies, such as workplace-communications business  Slack Technologies Inc.,  have even garnered lofty valuations by going public through direct listings. Those let companies sell shares directly to the public without going through banks, but prevent them from raising new money.</td>

Contracts linked to the S&P 500 were relatively flat. Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.4%, suggesting declines in tech stocks after the opening bell.<br />Investors’ appetite for risky assets rebounded on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments this week that the central bank will keep interest rates low for a while. Optimism about the economic recovery and a sharp rise in bond yields—which closed Wednesday at their highest level in a year—is prompting money managers to shift funds into stocks that are likely to benefit from a rebound this year. That has weighed on technology shares, which powered much of last year’s rally.<br />“The rise in bond yields triggers this rotation, away from growth stocks and more in favor of value stocks,” said Sophie Chardon, cross asset strategist at Lombard Odier. “The rise in yields is supportive for banks, higher oil prices are supportive for energy. It is a change of leadership.”<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 1.413%, from 1.388% on Wednesday. The yield on government bonds has been on the rise as investors cut their holdings of the safest assets.</td>

The deal has already produced hits such as “Sweet Home,” an apocalyptic suspense series. It has been watched by more than 22 million Netflix member households after its December debut, Netflix said last month, making it one of the Los Gatos, Calif.-based company’s more popular Korean-produced shows.<br />“Our commitment towards Korea is strong.

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden on Wednesday revoked most immigration restrictions that former President Donald Trump imposed last year in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The White House said it was revoking parts of a ban that blocked entry into the U.S. to family members of U.S. citizens, some immigrants with employment-based green cards and winners of the diversity visa lottery. Mr. Biden has left in place restrictions that block the entry of foreigners with several types of work-based visas including the H-1B visa for high-skilled foreign professionals. That aspect of the ban is set to expire on March 31.<br />The Trump administration, which imposed the ban on most forms of legal immigration in April and expanded it in June, said at the time it had been necessary to prevent foreigners from coming to the U.S. and taking jobs when unemployment had skyrocketed as a result of the pandemic. A Wall Street Journal review found the ban didn’t have the intended effect: Jobs allotted to foreigners, typically in high-skill roles as software engineers or seasonal positions such as working at a resort, went unfilled.<br />The ban “harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here,’’ the White House said. “It also harms industries in the United States that utilize talent from around the world.’’<br />The revoked ban applied to applicants for U.S. permanent residency who are parents or siblings of U.S. citizens, along with applicants for several types of employment-based permanent residency cards, called green cards.</td>

That is about half as much as it previously planned to buy.<br />But part of the deal not previously reported sets Mr. Neumann apart from other shareholders. It calls for SoftBank to give the 41-year-old the $50 million special payout and extend by five years a $430 million loan it made to him in late 2019, the people said.

      <td>A rally in everything from stocks to oil shows investors believe growth is coming</td>
      <td>Markets are signaling that an economy that plunged into its deepest recession in decades just a year ago is ready to roar.<br />Major U.S. stock indexes have set 32 record highs in 2021, including Wednesday’s 424-point surge by the Dow industrials to 31962. Long-term bond yields are rising, showing increasing demand for funds from consumers and businesses, and inflation expectations are at multiyear highs. The price of everything in markets, from a barrel of oil to a share of mall retailer GameStop Corp. to a bitcoin, seems to be going up.<br />And moments of caution have been short-lived. Earlier this week, investors sold tech stocks, concerned that the rising long-term interest rates brought by an improving economy would make tech less attractive—in effect, that the economic outlook was too good. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday reiterated that low rates would be around for a long time. Tech stocks promptly bounced.<br />The everything rally shows that investors believe the fun is just getting started. They believe that a combination of more fiscal stimulus, more-extensive Covid-19 vaccinations and pent-up demand for consumption, on a background of near record-low interest rates, will at last kick-start economic growth and inflation that have been elusive in recent years.<br />As the U.S. moves past the pandemic, markets are saying Americans will spend on big-ticket items such as vacations and weddings, companies will go on hiring sprees and the transition to new technologies such as electric vehicles will accelerate. The most optimistic investors believe the economy, just months after it was devastated by the pandemic, will bounce back in a manner akin to the Roaring ’20s.</td>

      <td>Candidates vying to be the next mayor of New York City have received millions of dollars from mostly local donors, including a concentration of large contributions coming from a few parts of Manhattan, according to city Campaign Finance Board records.<br />More than 46,740 donations have so far poured into the crowded mayor’s race, totaling $13,545,443, according to the board. More than three dozen candidates have filed for the contest to succeed Mayor Bill de Blasio, who will leave office at the end of this year due to term limits. The mayoral primaries will be held on June 22.<br />The majority of donors are from New York City, and 84% of the contributions were below $250, according to the campaign finance records. But a few ZIP Codes in Manhattan accounted for a large amount of high-dollar donations.<br />In the 10024 ZIP Code in Manhattan’s Upper West Side, 1,250 donors have given more than $514,000, according to the Campaign Finance Board records. The majority of donors in the ZIP Code gave to two Democratic mayoral candidates: city Comptroller Scott Stringer and Ray McGuire, a former vice chairman at Citigroup.<br />On Manhattan’s Upper East Side, 606 donors living in the 10021 ZIP Code gave a total of $472,986, records show. Most of the donations went to Mr. Stringer and Mr. McGuire, who isn’t participating in the public-matching-funds program run by the Campaign Finance Board.</td>

The momentum is building in terms of concluding these inquiries,” Ms. Dixon said in an interview.<br />Ms. Dixon is one of the world’s most influential privacy regulators because the data commission she leads is in charge enforcing the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, for companies that have their regional headquarters in Ireland.<br />Two cases, involving Facebook, are already on Ms. Dixon’s desk for draft decisions, she said. Five others, including one involving Google and others involving Facebook subsidiaries, are nearing the end of their investigations, with final reports either submitted to the companies for a final round of comments or received back, she added.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden announced three nominees to the U.S. Postal Service’s Board of Governors, saying they would make sure the agency “can effectively and efficiently serve all communities in our country.”<br />The president said Wednesday he was nominating Anton Hajjar, a former general counsel of the American Postal Workers Union; Amber McReynolds, chief executive of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for improved mail-in voting; and Ron Stroman, a former deputy postmaster general who led Mr. Biden’s transition team for postal-service issues.<br />If confirmed, they will fill three vacant seats on the nine-member board, which currently has six appointees of former President Donald Trump, two of whom are Democrats. The postmaster general serves at the pleasure of the board.<br />The announcement came as the House Oversight and Reform Committee heard testimony on Wednesday from Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a North Carolina businessman and Republican donor who was tapped by the board for the position last year.<br />Democrats have urged Mr. Biden to fill the vacant board seats in hopes that the new picks would help oust Mr. DeJoy amid criticism over mail-delivery delays.</td>

      <td>The Fed chief promises Treasury purchases as far as the eye can see.</td>
      <td>Inflation? What inflation? That was Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s main message to Congress and markets in two days of testimony this week, with a side order of modern monetary theory.<br />Mr. Powell told everyone not to worry about rising interest rates or soaring asset prices because he and the Fed aren’t worried. “The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved,” he said early and often.<br />He’s focusing the Fed instead on the full employment half of its mandate. Some 10 million jobs haven’t returned following the Covid-19 lockdowns of the past year, and Mr. Powell and other Fed board members aren’t wrong to suggest the data conceal many other people who have left the job market.<br />Yet Mr. Powell also thinks, or at least claims, that the Fed can solve this problem with monetary levers when the real fix will be when the vaccine rollout facilitates a rapid reopening of the economy. Mr. Powell thinks the economy could grow 6% or so this year. But he never explains why that growth wouldn’t naturally boost employment absent the Fed's interventions, or how stoking demand via successive government spending bills amid supply constraints won’t trigger inflation.<br />Mr. Powell also used the jobs issue to justify continued large-scale Fed purchases of mortgage-backed securities ($40 billion a month) and Treasury bonds ($80 billion). Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will be grateful. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal budget deficit will be $2.4 trillion this year under current law, and the Biden Administration’s $1.9 trillion spending bill would push it past $4 trillion.</td>

      <td>Stock is still well below its intraday peak of $483 in late January</td>
      <td>GameStop Corp.  shares skyrocketed higher in the final hour of trading Wednesday, finishing the day with a rally reminiscent of last month’s blockbuster gains.<br />Shares of the videogame retailer finished 104% higher to close at $91.71 after hovering below $50 for most of the day. The stock, which was halted twice on Wednesday for volatility, last traded at that level on Feb. 3.<br />A clear catalyst behind the sudden surge couldn’t be determined. The company said after markets closed Tuesday that its chief financial officer would resign March 26. GameStop in recent months has come under pressure to focus more heavily on e-commerce. Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen, who holds a nearly 13% stake in GameStop through his investment firm RC Ventures LLC, was recently added to the retailer’s board.<br />Since GameStop’s epic rise in late January, some individual investors have remained bullish on the stock and were re-energized when Keith Gill, the trader on Reddit known as DeepF—ingValue, disclosed that he had doubled down on the stock. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Gill posted a screenshot to Reddit showing that he had purchased an additional 50,000 shares of the stock. Following the news, the stock jumped 13% Monday.<br />Even with Wednesday’s surge, the stock is still trading more than 80% below its intraday peak of $483 in late January. Meanwhile, short interest in the stock has substantially diminished. As of Tuesday, short interest was roughly 39% of the stock’s free float, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That compares with well over 100% at the start of 2021.</td>
