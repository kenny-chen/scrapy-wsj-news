      <td>Federal Reserve faces a challenge in how it will eventually communicate an exit strategy with the market</td>
      <td>The first rule of tapering is don’t talk about tapering anytime soon.<br />Federal Reserve policy makers probably think the prospects for the economy in 2021 look significantly better than they did when they gathered mid-December. For now, though, the economy is facing the surge in Covid-19 cases that began last fall, along with the related stepped up caution and restrictions. Following their two-day meeting Wednesday, they focused on the downside.<br />They noted in their post-meeting statement that the recovery in the economy and job market has slowed. They again committed to keeping rates near zero until the labor market is tight and inflation has obviously cleared its 2% target rate, and to keep buying $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage bonds per month “until substantial further progress” has been made toward those goals.<br />Yet though the economy has weakened in recent months, economists have been raising their growth forecasts. Following the Fed’s December meeting, for example, economists at  JPMorgan Chase  reckoned that in the fourth-quarter of 2021, gross domestic product would be 3.4% above its year-earlier level. Since then, they have raised that forecast to 5.4%.<br />There are multiple forces driving the improved outlook. First, there is the Covid-19 relief package that was passed late last year. Its extension of jobless benefits, renewed support for small businesses and the direct payments it provided to many Americans assuaged concerns that GDP might actually contract in the first quarter relative to the fourth. Second, with Democrats gaining control of the Senate, another round of fiscal support is looking likely in the months ahead. Throw in expectations that enough people will be vaccinated for life to take on some semblance of normal later this year, and things start looking pretty rosy.</td>

      <td>It is tempting to see GameStop’s soaring stock as merely the result of clownish behavior in a chat room. That would be a mistake.</td>
      <td>GameStop  is the platonic ideal of a stock bubble.<br />A combination of easy money, a real improvement in the company’s prospects, technical support from a short squeeze and a mad rush to get rich or die trying pushed stock in the retailer up 64-fold from late August to Wednesday’s close. Anyone who has held on for 10 days made gains of more than 10 times their money.<br />It is tempting to see GameStop as merely clownish behavior in a chat room having some amusing effects on a stock few care about. That would be a mistake.<br />Sure, the wildly popular Reddit group Wall Street Bets—slogan: like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal—is full of childish chat. Several users report that they have bet their parents’ pension fund on GameStop or that the boss’s daughter has bought in. There are plenty of calls for the stock to go to $1,000 or more (it started the year at $18.84).<br />But GameStop’s soaring stock—and similar moves in  BlackBerry ,   Nokia  and others—is a bubble in microcosm, with lessons for those of us worrying about froth elsewhere in the market.</td>

      <td>SO MANY DISHES on the menu at Balkan Treat Box come straight from St. Louis’s Bosnian community, the largest outside Europe, said chef Loryn Nalic. Her husband and business partner, Edo Nalic, came to the city as a refugee in his teens. Early in their courtship, this recipe became a touchstone.<br />Ms. Nalic learned to cook the meat-and-potato pie helping to prepare for a community event. A phyllo crust with a filling of potatoes and smoked beef, it traditionally comes with yogurt drizzled on top—and also takes quite a long time to make, Ms. Nalic noted. At Balkan Treat Box doing things traditionally is very much the point, but for those cooking at home the chef has come up with a few short cuts.<br />Jumpstart the process by blanching the potatoes until they’re tender and creamy; meanwhile, sauté the onions and the sausage. For the crust? Frozen phyllo to the rescue. Simply layer sheets of thawed dough in a pan and brush with melted butter. Folded over the savory filling, the pastry bakes until golden and crisp. In addition to that drizzle of yogurt, you can add crumbled feta and some parsley if you really want to make it a feast (however fast).<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

      <td>I applaud Abigail Shrier in her advocacy of girls, especially when it comes to the thorny issue of transgender girls’ participation in sports (“Joe Biden’s First Day Began the End of Girls’ Sports,” op-ed, Jan. 23). Perhaps no issue encapsulates the hypocrisy of the far-left agenda than putting the needs of the few—transgender girls—above those of the many—biological girls. I am hopeful that female athletes will unite in opposition to President Biden’s recent executive order and that prominent female athletes will express their discontent. As Ms. Shrier eloquently writes, so much is at stake for the next generation of girls. As the father of a first-grade daughter, this issue is resonant for me.<br />Jonathan N. Fiskus<br />Riverdale, N.Y.<br /><br />Abigail Shrier cites the example of just two trans athletes competing successfully against natal girls, speculating, without evidence, on the possible repercussions for “scouting and scholarship opportunities and trophies.” This thin argument fails to support the headline’s dire prediction and Ms. Shrier’s contention, with its wily figure shaming, about “a body blow to the rights of women and girls.”</td>

      <td>Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Keystone Pipeline Kill” (Jan. 21): Spare us the concern for Canada’s feelings. Canadians, and particularly those of us from Alberta, have known for years that Keystone was at risk. Significant changes in energy markets, environmental and climate outlook, and political will over the 15 years since Keystone was proposed have painted an increasingly bleak picture for the project. These forces are at play world-wide, including in Canada, where we can’t get a pipeline built across British Columbia for the same reasons. So as disappointing as the Keystone cancellation may be to many, it is hardly a surprise or an insult.<br />Canadians have also known for decades that in dealing with America, the rules may change midgame or that Americans may disregard the rules entirely if it suits them. Softwood lumber comes readily to the mind of most Canadians. Investors know the same thing, so the president’s announcement was neither surprising nor a departure from well-established practice.<br />As far as insults go, the president’s action doesn’t even rank. The gold standard for that might be President Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, on the assertion that those industries constitute a threat to U.S. national security. Canada, a threat to U.S. national security? Now that’s an insult.<br />Brian Ward<br />Thousand Oaks, Calif.</td>

But a train had to stop at a water tower (charging station) when it ran low, sitting there, waiting a long time to be refilled. Civil engineers working for the railroads came up with under-way (without stopping) water replacement. To accomplish this, trenches were built in the railroad bed and filled with water. As the train passed, it sucked up the water without slowing down.<br />Modifying the train, the tracks, the plumbing and the labor required enormous costs paid for by the railroad—not the taxpayer.<br />Ecclesiastes 1:9: Nothing under the sun is new.<br />Thomas Kolber</td>

Spotify is also leaning on notable actors to voice audiobooks like Forest Whitaker, Hilary Swank and Cynthia Erivo.<br />Here’s how to stream them:<br />(HBO Max)<br />When John Lee Hancock wrote the script for “The Little Things” in the ‘90s, he envisioned it as a ‘70s movie—complicated characters, lots of questions and not as many answers. He had a deal with Warner Bros. and Steven Spielberg, but Mr. Spielberg ultimately passed on directing it. The story, about a sheriff’s deputy, a detective, and the search for a serial killer, was too dark for Mr. Spielberg to dive into right after “Schindler’s List,” he recalls.<br />Years later, after Mr. Hancock started directing films like “The Rookie” (2002), his producer on “The Little Things” encouraged him to direct the movie himself. But by then Mr. Hancock had young children at home and didn’t want to spend two years in the darkness, either.</td>

      <td>Today’s researchers have tossed out price theory and don’t realize they’ve been politically compromised.</td>
      <td>William Allen, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of California, Los Angeles died Jan. 15 at 96. Few noted it, but Allen’s death was momentous. It represented a generational shift in the economics profession, one that bodes ill for economists and the public. Allen truly believed in economics—something that is hard to say about most economists these days.<br />Allen was among the last of a generation of economists who were masters of their craft. He wrote, along with his friend and colleague Armen Alchian, an excellent economics textbook that conveys the power and potential of the economic way of thinking: Despite the complexities of markets, economists can get at the heart of how they work by focusing on prices. This insight is so important, it gives economists’ core tool kit a name: price theory. Nobody can be an economist who is unfamiliar with or uncomfortable using this tool kit.<br />Yet by this standard, there are not many economists left. Professional economists are abandoning price theory in droves. The new status quo has upended the field. Economics is increasingly less scientific and more susceptible to political influence.<br />The absence of price theory in today’s economic research would have befuddled the great economists of the past. Contrary to the field’s naysayers, the golden age of 20th-century price theory was never about “neoliberalism” or “market fundamentalism.” Instead, it applied to markets a simple yet brilliant framework that revealed the hidden ways market prices—exchange ratios between goods—facilitated an extraordinary amount of economic coordination. It also showed why many (but not all) restrictions on price adjustments, such as rent controls, resulted in costly and unproductive secondary effects. This was all a part of a broad explanatory project. While individual economists had their policy preferences, the economic way of thinking was above politics.<br />For years, economics has been getting less theoretical and more empirical. Economists are spending less time building and thinking through simple models, and more time collecting and analyzing data. The “identification revolution” in economics raised the payoff, in the form of elite publications, to finding good data from quasiexperimental settings and conducting advanced statistical analyses. Better empirical work should certainly be applauded. But it came at a cost: an entire cohort of economists with serious theoretical blind spots.</td>

      <td>We know what China is doing in Xinjiang. It’s now official. How will woke corporations react?</td>
      <td>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s determination that the People’s Republic of China is engaged in a systematic genocide of the Uighurs was one of the most significant recent developments in U.S. foreign policy. The State Department found that the atrocities have expanded to shocking reproductive coercion: “PRC authorities have conducted forced sterilizations and abortions on Uyghur women, coerced them to marry non-Uyghurs, and separated Uyghur children from their families.”<br />Because the announcement came shortly before President Biden’s inauguration, its far-reaching implications haven’t sunk in. The Trump administration would have done better to issue this finding before the election, but officially invoking the “genocide” label met significant resistance within the government, as it has in past presidencies. Mr. Pompeo deserves credit for pushing it through.<br />The new secretary of state, Antony Blinken, also deserves credit for not making genocide a political issue: He immediately concurred in his predecessor’s determination. It is now America’s official, bipartisan position that China is engaged in “ongoing” genocide—the gravest of all international crimes.<br />Joe Biden was ahead of the curve, accusing China of genocide in August. At the time a Biden spokesman added, “If the Trump administration does indeed choose to call this out for what it is, as Joe Biden already did, the pressing question is what will Donald Trump do to take action.” That question now passes to Mr. Biden.<br />The State Department has made a finding of genocide only six times, two of them in the past quarter-century: regarding Islamic State atrocities against religious minorities in Syria and Iraq (2016) and Sudan’s campaign in Darfur (2011). But ISIS and Sudan weren’t exactly major U.S. trading partners.</td>

      <td>A flurry of executive orders from the Biden administration has resulted in a wider selloff in the energy industry</td>
      <td><br />The Biden administration’s freeze on new federal oil and gas leases is bad news for the U.S. energy industry, but the market reaction has thrown up opportunities, too.<br />Mr. Biden’s first week in office has been a whirlwind of bad news for the sector: Last week, the administration revoked a permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline and placed a temporary ban on federal leasing and permitting for oil and gas. On Wednesday, the administration announced a pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal territory. While the actions resulted in a steep sector selloff, the moves were telegraphed on the campaign trail.<br />Companies with heavier federal lease exposure—including  EOG Resources ,   Devon Energy ,   ConocoPhillips  and  Occidental Petroleum —started underperforming the broader basket of oil and gas exploration companies in the middle of last year as investors weighed Mr. Biden’s campaign promises of stricter limits on federal oil and gas leasing. The threat seemed plausible given the precedent that the Obama administration set in 2016 when it suspended most new leases for coal mining on federal lands. The same companies suffered steeper drops than the sector overall since last week, when the Biden administration announced the temporary moratorium on leasing and permits.<br />The real surprise seems to be that the Biden administration is weighing the possibility of stopping new permits or not allowing permit renewals on federal territory. The order calls for a “rigorous review of all existing leasing and permitting practices”—something the industry hadn’t anticipated. The move is likely to spur heavy legal challenges.</td>

      <td>How cocooning—or wrapping up in swathes of fabulous fabric—can kelp you kick the Covid blues</td>
      <td>WHO NEEDS a hug? If you’ve been missing physical contact while social distancing these past months, you’re not alone—even if you technically are. I’m among the estimated 28% of Americans who live solo, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, but surely I’m not the only one who’s been quarantining in a single-bedroom apartment with two only moderately affectionate pets (rabbits, in my case) and a coldly efficient Peloton.<br />I have my resources, though. When I’m curled up on my couch craving a squeeze, I find solace in my late mother’s big, black, bubble-shaped, wool cocoon coat. Softer than a sweatshirt, this coat can be swooshed and swooped into myriad styles; whenever I wrap it around my shoulders, I’m enveloped in snuggly reassurance. That it ushers high-volume fabulosity into my flat, isolated life doesn’t hurt.<br />And I’m not alone here, either. Cocooning—or shrouding yourself in decadently draped fabric or a bulbous sculptural garment—is trending, perhaps because it swaddles you into calm. “If you live by yourself and you’re not being hugged, [clothes] can replace that sensation,” said Dr. Carolyn Mair, a London behavioral psychologist. “You feel encased, safe and protected, and we’re looking for that now.” Indeed: Pinterest reports that searches for “cocoon sweater” shot up 155% among its 442 million users in the period between fall 2019 and fall 2020, as compared to the same period a year prior. It predicts cocooning will be a key 2021 trend.<br />In line with that, the spring 2021 runways swarmed with consoling chrysalises. Simone Rocha suggested swathing yourself in layers of Grecian-draped taffeta; Loewe’s Jonathan Anderson proposed you wiggle into a marshmallowy white skirt and a woven dome-like top; and Noir Kei Ninomiya presented all-consuming pink orbs embellished with frills or bows.<br />“Fashion is very reactive,” said New York stylist Malina Joseph Gilchrist. “And the cocoon shape offers protection, comfort and a sense of security.” She observed that these imposing silhouettes recall the work of Spanish couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga who, with his scarab-like coats and puffed-up gowns, popularized the cocoon in the mid-20th century. “We’re in a really uncertain time,” she said. “I think that designers always look to the past for reassurance.”</td>

This suggests that investors don’t see Boeing’s disadvantage extending much beyond the grounding of the MAX, the impact of which was baked into the company’s stock price before the outbreak. It is a risky assumption.<br />Fourth-quarter earnings show why the gulf between the companies could in fact get larger—despite a return to service of the MAX, which was cleared to fly by European regulators on Wednesday.<br />The Chicago-based plane maker on Wednesday reported its biggest-ever annual loss. Investors broadly expected it, but were still disappointed by the final tally: Losses for the fourth quarter of 2020 came in at $8.4 billion, compared with analysts’ expectations of about $500 million.<br />This was in part the result of a $6.5 billion pretax charge Boeing took on its 777X wide-body plane program. The company has now pushed its first delivery all the way back to 2023—making it three years late. The 777X has been affected by the pandemic, but also the assumption that regulators will take much longer to certify new jets after the MAX fiasco.</td>

      <td>Online-forum punters have exploited a quirk to push up some unloved stocks. The risk is that investors start believing the share prices imply real-world prospects.</td>
      <td>Wall Street can’t take its eyes off once-unloved stocks such as  GameStop  and  BlackBerry ,  which are rocketing due to a kind of betting game played by online forum users. The real risk is that investors start to believe something deeper is going on.<br />The past year has seen a boom in individuals buying stocks through retail online platforms such as Robinhood. More and more, they seem to be coordinating their moves on sites such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets, placing wagers on firms that are under attack by professional speculators like hedge funds. At Tuesday’s close, GameStop, once a popular target for short sellers, was up almost 3,700% over six months.<br />There are two main causes of big market moves. The healthier one is when new information comes to light about a company, an industry or the economy at large, and financial assets are repriced to reflect it. The other is when market participants buy or sell in a rush, often because they suddenly need to protect their finances—in which case asset prices don’t convey much useful information.<br />The latter is at play now. Hedge funds’ short bets have been unsettled, forcing them to buy back the stocks to limit their losses. Also, punters have been using options contracts to prop up their targets. Such instruments can amplify even small market moves, because they force banks to take the other side and then hedge the risk by buying the actual underlying stocks. It can create a feedback loop: Those stocks then go up, and the value of the options tied to them increases even more, forcing banks to hedge further, and so on.<br />Reddit users haven’t shied away from the technical nature of the price moves, correctly crediting it for their success. But market gyrations caused by bottlenecks in financial plumbing don’t tend to last. The 2018 carnage unleashed by option-driven low-volatility strategies can attest to that. Eventually, there aren’t any forced buyers left. The losses are usually limited in scope.</td>

      <td>Our skin has become a road map of the past year’s lows.</td>
      <td>I feel like I’ve aged six years in six months. These days, it’s a statement often repeated among friends and heard by dermatologists. Can we chalk it up to quarantine exhaustion, or has lockdown actually done something to speed up the aging process on our skin? “I’m hearing more complaints about accelerated aging in my practice than ever before,” says Whitney Bowe, a New York City–based dermatologist and author of The Beauty of Dirty Skin. “It’s very similar to what I used to see when there was a death in the family or a divorce and patients would come in and say, ‘I feel like I aged five years overnight.’ Now we’re seeing that with Covid.”<br />What’s at play may be primarily the effect of chronic stress, which can have a more harmful impact on the skin than shorter periods of acute stress. “Stress drives neurologic and endocrine responses to perceived threats, and prolonged activation of these responses results in abnormalities of the immune system, increased free radicals and subsequent DNA damage, all of which contribute to skin-quality deterioration,” says Robert Anolik, a New York City–based cosmetic dermatologist. The brain responds to perceived danger, he explains, by triggering the fight-or-flight response, leading to adrenaline release and tipping off a surge of other hormones like cortisol, the prolonged effects of which can eventually impact the skin.<br />Long periods of elevated cortisol exposure may be causing many of us to feel that our faces have, quite literally, fallen. “It can actually inhibit your body’s production of hyaluronic acid, collagen and lipids,” says Bowe. “Hyaluronic acid binds a thousand times its weight in water, so it really helps to plump up the skin, and collagen is the triple-helix protein that keeps the skin tight and firm, helping to prevent wrinkles and fine lines.” Finally, lipids, says Bowe, are the healthy fats that bolster the skin’s ability to function as a barrier. When that barrier function is impaired, there’s transepidermal water loss. “Our skin becomes leaky,” Bowe explains, “as water is more likely to evaporate out and allergens, irritants and pollutants are more likely to penetrate in and trigger inflammation.”<br />Inflammation is an issue that New York City aestheticians Carrie Lindsey and Taylor Worden and Boston-based dermatologist Ranella Hirsch all report seeing more of in their respective practices in the past year. Hirsch chalks much of it up to stress and to people overdoing it at home with their skin-care regimens. “Too much free time to experiment with skin care means lots of damaged barriers and inflamed faces,” says Hirsch. “That irritation can quickly age the appearance.” Among Worden’s clients, frequent mask wearing and infrequent mask washing have led to a lot of congested pores along the jawline—now known by the unfortunate term maskne—along with an increase in dermatitis around the mouth. Meanwhile, excess alcohol and caffeine consumption have resulted in dehydration. Because of the cascading exposure to cortisol, and the skin producing less hyaluronic acid and collagen than it naturally would, Bowe’s patients who usually come in for filler every nine months are now returning in five. “The skin is fighting an uphill battle right now,” she says. One other pandemic side effect is a surge in sun damage and melasma. “The lack of regular 9-to-5 office hours and a need to get out of our confined spaces, and because it was the safest place to meet, meant people were outside more than ever before,” says Lindsey.<br />While the pandemic has brought on some very real skin issues, there is also an element that may just be in our head. Hirsch, who dubs the phenomenon the “watched pot,” says, “Never in modern history have so many people had the collective time to stare at their faces up close.” The Zoom factor doesn’t help, either. “It’s impossible to underestimate how much looking at ourselves at less than flattering angles and lighting has impacted our sense of our appearance,” Hirsch says. Though there are a few topical products that one should always use, such as sunscreen and an antioxidant serum to neutralize free radicals, the best treatments for our skin aren’t topical. A healthy diet—antioxidant rich, fruit and vegetable heavy—regular movement, enough sleep, plenty of water, meditative practice such as deep breathing and mental-health support are key for maintaining skin health. It’s a good idea to scale back on the product load. “Hard as it may be to believe, my most fervent hope and the advice I offer daily to my patients is to do less,” says Hirsch. And, most important, be gentle with yourself. “Our skin will recover,” says Lindsey, “and we will begin to look and feel like ourselves again.”</td>

The continentwide death rate surpassed the global average for the first time in January. From Senegal to Zambia, daily cases have risen to roughly twice the previous peak.<br />“The second wave is here with vengeance and our systems are overwhelmed,” said John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />The new deadlier wave could widen the gap between the world’s richest and poorest nations. Unlike in wealthier countries, African economies can’t afford to repeat last year’s hard lockdowns, which pushed the continent into its worst recession since records began, according to the International Monetary Fund.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Expectations for an economic recovery and continued government aid are fueling overconfidence among investors, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday, raising the risk of a sudden drop in asset prices that could threaten financial stability.<br />“With investors betting on persistent policy backstop, a sense of complacency appears to be permeating markets,” Tobias Adrian, head of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department, and his deputy, Fabio Natalucci, wrote in a blog post. “Coupled with apparent uniform investor views, this raises the risk of a market correction or repricing.”<br />Even so, governments should continue to provide fiscal and monetary support until a sustainable recovery takes hold, they said. “Reducing or withdrawing support at this stage could jeopardize the global economic recovery.”<br />The blog post accompanied an update to the fund’s semiannual Global Financial Stability Report released on Wednesday.<br />Delays in vaccinations, especially in emerging market economies that account for about 65% of global growth, could lead to a tightening in financial conditions and a rise in financial vulnerabilities that have been held in check so far, they said. Those include rising corporate and government debt levels and declining profitability in some banking systems.</td>

For example, one rule disqualified applicants from asylum if they passed through a third country en route to the U.S. without making a claim in that country.<br />The order would also freeze agreements that the Trump administration signed with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to send asylum seekers to those countries to request protection there instead.<br />Mr. Biden is also expected to rescind a memo that created a program known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, which has forced tens of thousands of asylum seekers arriving at the U.S. southern border to return to Mexico and wait, sometimes for years, as the American court system processes their requests.</td>

      <td>Ant Group Co. is planning to turn itself into a financial holding company overseen by China’s central bank, responding to pressure to fall fully in line with financial regulations, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Chinese regulators recently told Ant, which is controlled by billionaire Jack Ma, to become a financial holding company in its entirety, subjecting it to more stringent capital requirements, the people said. Ant, in response, has submitted to authorities an outline of a restructuring plan, they said.<br />The plan represents a significant turnaround by a digital-payments juggernaut that has in recent years tried to shed its image as a financial-services provider and fashion itself as an internet-technology company, which helped it command lofty valuations. Before its blockbuster initial public offering was called off in November, Ant had been on track to go public at a valuation north of $300 billion, well above the market capitalizations of the world’s biggest banks.<br />Designating Ant in its entirety as a financial holding company wasn’t something earlier envisioned by the company’s executives and stakeholders. In its listing prospectus last year, Ant said it intended for one of its subsidiaries to become a financial holding company and house its licensed financial businesses such as asset management and consumer lending. Doing this at the group level will subject Ant to a thicket of regulations similar to those that govern banks, and affect its growth and profitability.<br />The restructuring plan, still under deliberation, could be finalized before China goes on a weeklong Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February, people familiar with the matter said.</td>

That was even before the coronavirus pandemic brought a decadelong boom in aircraft sales to a halt, prompting the company to shed 31,000 jobs.<br />The company took a $6.5 billion pretax charge on the 777X to reflect lower profits over the life of the wide-body plane that is now expected to enter service in 2023, three years late. Airlines have shied away from big jets like the 777X as international travel demand collapsed.<br />Boeing’s fourth-quarter loss lifted its annual deficit to $11.94 billion, with sales for the year slipping 24% to $58.2 billion. That dropped Boeing to fourth spot by that measure behind  Raytheon Technologies Corp. ,  Lockheed Martin Corp.  and  Airbus SE .<br />Chicago-based Boeing didn’t provide any financial guidance on Wednesday. Analysts expect sales to increase this year with the resumption of 787 deliveries following quality problems that halted customers taking any new jets since October.</td>

In the South, those jobs held nearly steady.<br />The South’s milder winter weather makes it easier to dine outside or participate in other outdoors activities, said Mark Vitner, a Charlotte, N.C.-based economist at Wells Fargo Securities.

That will require companies to produce or purchase large numbers of offset credits, each of which represents a metric ton of carbon.<br />There are already futures contracts tied to carbon-offset credits that are used in so-called cap-and-trade systems around the world. California regulators, for instance, oversee a market that seeks to reduce greenhouse gases by making it more expensive over time for companies operating there to pollute. Companies must buy allowances for certain volumes of emissions and may use cheaper offset credits to cover a portion of their tab.</td>

First, to counteract the higher risk of infection, restrictions on activity may be tightened, pushing some economies back into recession. Britain, where one fast-spreading variant is now widespread, re-entered a full lockdown on Jan. 5. Its economy, which shrank 10% last year, is likely contracting now. The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday it would grow 4.5% this year, down from its October forecast of 5.9%.<br />The second threat is of a possible new variant that is resistant to the immunity conferred by existing vaccines and past infections, which could trigger a new cycle of restrictions and require a new round of vaccinations.<br />If such a variant emerges, manufacturers think vaccines can be updated relatively quickly. Nonetheless, James Stock, an economist at Harvard University who has studied the virus and the economy, warned of a “scenario of this thing sticking around for a much longer time frame.’’</td>

The company reported quarterly revenue declines in its pay-TV and WarnerMedia units, offsetting gains in its core wireless phone division.<br />Overall, AT&T reported a fourth-quarter loss of $13.89 billion, or $1.95 a share, compared with a profit of $2.39 billion, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 2.4% to $45.7 billion.<br />The coronavirus pandemic has strained the giant, hurting advertising at cable networks like CNN and TBS and closing many of the theaters that show its Warner Bros. films. Those pullbacks obscured gains in the company’s wireless service, which still generates more than half of the company’s profits.<br />The last three months of the year gave AT&T a net gain of 800,000 postpaid phone subscribers, a metric closely watched by Wall Street.

      <td>Hyundai looks well placed in the EV race: But in the meantime, it’s racking up the earnings too.</td>
      <td>Hyundai Motor ’s  electric dreams have helped supercharge its stock. But unlike some other car makers, its old-school auto business is doing very well too: That makes it look like a solid investment.<br />The South Korean car maker reported a 41% rise in operating profit last quarter from a year earlier, indicating a strong recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Hyundai also managed to deliver higher profits despite selling fewer cars. Demand for pricier products like its Palisade sports utility vehicles and cars under its luxury brand, Genesis, have pushed its operating margins to their highest since early 2017. The results, however, missed already-bullish analysts’ expectations slightly: The strong Korean won and recent recalls for its Kona electric vehicle dragged down earnings.<br />But overall, the quarter confirmed that the company is moving in the right direction. Analysts expect a strong 2021: consensus estimates on S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast a 77% rise in this year’s operating profit from prepandemic 2019.<br />The successful shift of Hyundai’s product mix to the more premium end is clearly driving the earnings recovery, but the company’s more futuristic bets are fueling investors’ hopes. Hyundai and its affiliate  Kia Motors  announced in 2019 they would invest $35 billion into future mobility technologies including EVs and self-driving cars. They unveiled a new platform dedicated to manufacturing EVs last year and plan to launch 23 EV models by 2025.  Credit Suisse  expects battery EVs to make up 11% of Hyundai’s sales in 2025, up from 3% last year. The company is also one of the biggest investors in hydrogen fuel cells. The car maker bought a majority stake last month in Boston Dynamics, the company famous for making dancing robots.<br />The market frenzy in EVs has provided fuel for Hyundai’s rally. Its share price has more than doubled since the beginning of 2020, making it one of the best performers among traditional auto makers. At $55 billion, Hyundai has a market value similar to  BMW  and Stellantis, the company formed from the merger of  Fiat Chrysler  and Peugeot. The recent news that it held talks with Apple about cooperation on driverless electric vehicles this month has given the stock another push.</td>

Too many New York tenants can’t pay rent right now, which is making it harder for landlords to pay back their loans and causing tenant debt to pile up.<br />Both sides want to address the issue with more government action, mostly in the form of streamlined rental assistance.<br />“It’s nothing like a crisis to bring odd bedfellows together,” said Judith Goldiner, attorney-in-charge in the Legal Aid Society’s civil law reform unit. “I guess REBNY thinks they can’t evict themselves out of this crisis.

      <td>Tesla Inc.  is expected to report its first full-year profit, a milestone powered by record vehicle deliveries in the face of a global pandemic and a growing appetite for electric cars.<br />The Silicon Valley car maker delivered around half a million vehicles last year, up more than a third from a year earlier, even as world-wide auto sales plunged roughly 14%, according to researcher LMC Automotive.<br />Wall Street expects such resilience to help Tesla generate around $1.3 billion in 2020 annual profit when the company posts earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to FactSet, on sales of about $31.1 billion. That compares with an $862 million loss in 2019 on sales of $24.6 billion.<br />Tesla delivered quarterly profits during the pandemic despite the temporary shutdown of the company’s lone U.S. car plant because of the health crisis. To manage the impact, Chief Executive Elon Musk battled with local authorities to reopen the factory, temporarily reduced salaries, furloughed workers and sought rent breaks. Later in the year, he tested positive for Covid-19.<br />The 17-year-old company’s performance, coupled with wider investor enthusiasm about electric vehicles, sent the stock soaring more than 700% last year and turned Tesla into the world’s most valuable auto maker. The string of quarterly profits also allowed it to secure a spot in the S&P 500 index.</td>

There is a similar variety of masks on the faces of every player and coach on the sideline. NBA teams playing through a pandemic are governed by hundreds of pages of health protocols, but they have more flexibility when it comes to one preventive measure: which masks they wear.<br />This is the latest way in which sports have become a microcosm of the U.S. Masks remain the most powerful weapon in fighting the spread of the coronavirus, with vaccinations still weeks or months away for the majority of people, while the most protective masks are no longer as scarce as they were in the early days of the pandemic.<br />But many Americans are still grabbing the most available or most comfortable masks as if they’re also the most effective. They’re not.<br />Now some doctors, scientists and health officials believe it’s no longer enough to tell people to wear masks. It’s time to tell them to start wearing better masks—or wearing two masks.</td>

      <td>The videogames retailer has become a favorite of online traders seeking to make money from buying options</td>
      <td>Shares of a handful of firms such as  GameStop Corp.  and  BlackBerry Ltd.  have posted triple-digit gains in recent weeks, part of a frenzy whipped up by individual investors. Here’s what you need to know.<br />Shares of GameStop are up more than sevenfold in 2021, compared with a 2.5% rise in the S&P 500. The Grapevine, Texas, videogames retailer has become a favorite of online traders who invest in companies championed on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets.<br />These investors target short sellers who are betting the shares will fall due to what they see as the firm’s business challenges. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s basket of the 50 stocks with the highest short interest—Wall Street wagers that the shares will fall—was up 25% for the year through Friday. Surging prices in heavily shorted shares such as GameStop have led to large losses at hedge funds that bet against stocks, prompting an emergency $2.75 billion deal to rescue one such firm.<br />GameStop shares began to take off on Jan. 11, after the company said it had agreed to add three new directors to its board, and the rally accelerated in the days that followed. In part the gains reflect the popularity in recent months of momentum trading, the practice of investing in firms whose share prices are rising in the expectation they will continue to do so, and a surge over the past year in options trading, which allows users to make large wagers with a relatively small upfront investment.<br />Options are contracts that allow investors to buy or sell a stock at a specified price, either on or until a specified expiration date. They have become increasingly popular with small investors in recent years, as brokerages have made it cheaper and easier to trade them. Options trading volume set a record last year, averaging just under 30 million contracts a day. This year, that number is over 40 million, according to Options Clearing Corp.—a rise of more than a third.</td>

      <td>Yields have stabilized after surging on Democratic Senate wins, but sharp increase has alerted investors to threat higher yields pose to riskier assets</td>
      <td>A sharp climb in U.S. government bond yields has stalled, easing investors’ concerns that rising rates could undercut recent gains in riskier assets.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note has hovered just above 1% for the past nine sessions after jumping from around 0.9% to almost 1.2% in just six days of trading.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, vaulted higher on Jan. 6 when Democrats won two pivotal Senate elections, securing control of the chamber. That boosted investors’ expectations for government spending—which can weigh on bonds by leading to a larger supply of Treasurys—as well as economic growth and inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of bonds’ fixed payments.<br />A $38 billion auction of 10-year notes on Jan. 12 posed a key test of the market. Yields had breached levels not seen since early in the pandemic and were rising quickly, with investors unsure about where they were heading. A poorly received auction could have added to the selling. Instead, it met strong demand, as did a 30-year bond auction the next day, and yields quickly steadied.<br />“A lot of people were kind of saying, ‘OK, well, how far does this go?’” said Blake Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy at NatWest Markets. “Then when we got these strong auctions, that was a clear sign that, ‘OK, there’s demand somewhere.’”</td>

      <td>TOKYO—The organizers of this year’s Summer Olympics in Tokyo have pushed back hard on recent speculation that the Games will have to be scrapped because of the pandemic. There is one more person they’d like on the team to press the message: President Biden.<br />“Mr. Biden is dealing with a tough situation with the coronavirus,” said Haruyuki Takahashi, a member of the executive board of Japan’s Olympic organizing committee. “But if he makes a positive statement about the Olympics going ahead, we’d gain strong momentum.”<br />The U.S. brings the largest contingent of athletes and the richest pot of television money to the Games. It is also Japan’s ally and military protector, so an expression of determination to push ahead would be influential with a skeptical Japanese public and reassure other countries that aren’t sure about sending athletes to Tokyo.<br />Uncertainty over the Games is rising as virus cases have rebounded in many countries and vaccination programs have stuttered. A U.K. newspaper reported last week that Japan has given up on hosting the Olympics this year. The government called the report “categorically untrue.”<br />International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bachheld phone calls on Friday with national Olympic committees around the world to reassure them about the Games and discuss coronavirus vaccinations for athletes. He has said there is no alternative plan for the Tokyo Olympics.</td>

      <td>Republicans signal why most will vote against convicting Trump.</td>
      <td>Forty-five Senate Republicans voted Tuesday to support a motion saying an impeachment trial of a former President is unconstitutional, and the media are professing shock. Haven’t they been paying attention? GOP opposition to trying a former President who is now a private citizen has been building since Inauguration Day, and based on current impeachment evidence the vote suggests the trial will end in Senate acquittal.<br />This has been predictable since House Democrats voted to impeach Mr. Trump in the waning days of his Presidency and then waited until he was gone before sending the article of impeachment to the Senate. Rand Paul of Kentucky offered the procedural motion. It was defeated 55-45, with five GOP Senators voting with the Democrats. But to convict at an impeachment trial requires a two-thirds majority, or 17 current GOP Senators.<br />There are good arguments on both sides of the constitutional question, and Mr. Trump’s behavior was impeachable. But if Democrats go ahead with the trial, the likeliest result is acquittal, and Mr. Trump will claim vindication and say his second impeachment was as political as the first. Before this is over, Democrats may become enablers of Mr. Trump’s political revival.</td>

      <td>Software titan’s cloud growth and profit margins accelerate despite intense competition</td>
      <td>Microsoft  didn’t rebuild its business around a possible global crisis, but the nature and timing of the pandemic certainly played to its strengths.<br />Like its big tech peers, the software giant has seen some distinct benefits from the coronavirus outbreak that has otherwise crippled much of the world economy. A rush of businesses scrambling to make their operations remote has driven demand for cloud-based services, while workers and students stuck at home are snapping up devices like PCs and tablets. Many of them are also passing the extra time with videogames.<br />All three helped Microsoft in its fiscal second quarter, which ended Dec. 31. The company reported Tuesday afternoon that revenue for the period jumped nearly 17% year over year to a record $43 billion. Results in all three of its business segments blew past Wall Street’s forecasts—as did profit. Microsoft’s operating margin came in at 42% for the quarter—4 percentage points higher than for the same period last year. The company’s commercial cloud portfolio saw revenue jump 34% year over year to $16.7 billion. That is both an acceleration from the previous quarter and $1 billion higher than analysts had forecast, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.<br />Plenty of companies found themselves in the right business at the right time over the past 10 months. In Microsoft’s case, though, the pandemic only accelerated some trends on which the company was capitalizing. In particular, the company’s cloud business already was growing steadily. Microsoft also has been able to expand the profitability of its cloud computing businesses despite intense competition from  Amazon.com  and Google. The company noted Tuesday that commercial cloud gross margins came in at 71% for the December quarter—up 4 percentage points from the same period last year.<br />Microsoft also managed to deliver a forecast for the March quarter that was ahead of analysts’ estimates and to affirm that it expects another year of double-digit growth in both revenue and operating earnings for the fiscal year ending in June. Microsoft’s stock rose more than 4% after-hours following Tuesday’s results. That follows a 41% jump over the past 12 months. Its performance actually lags behind the Nasdaq Composite Index a bit as investors have plowed into smaller, trendier cloud names. But as Microsoft keeps reliably demonstrating, size is no handicap.</td>

The bank said at the time that it would take a total of $174 million in compensation from current and former executives.<br />Mr. Solomon’s 2020 pay would have been $10 million higher but for the actions its board of directors took in response to the 1MDB saga, Goldman said in the filing. His compensation package consisted of a $2 million base salary, a $4.65 million cash bonus and a $10.85 million stock award that is tied to how well the bank performs over the next few years.<br />Costs and fines related to the fallout from the 1MDB scandal took a bite out of what was a banner year for Goldman’s businesses, which got a big boost from the markets’ bounceback from the depths of the coronavirus recession. Annual revenue of $44.56 billion was Goldman’s highest since 2009.</td>

The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Force Congress to Cooperate<br />President Biden inherits a deeply polarized nation. He must fulfill his promise, made during his campaign and inaugural address, to instill unity. Fixing our polarization demands something other than business as usual. It requires cultivating a nontribal, no-nonsense environment in which legislators have no option but to cooperate.<br />Mr. Biden should harness the presidential veto power to reject any legislation that doesn’t receive support from at least 20% of the opposition. The constraint would force lawmakers to come to creative compromises, crafting legislation that the broad majority of the country would support. This would set the tone for the American public, demonstrating that civility and cooperation are possible.</td>

      <td>Congress has a chance to repeal the 1887 Electoral Count Act.</td>
      <td>When Donald Trump addressed supporters in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 at a rally, he led them to believe they could change the 2020 election outcome. Yet states had certified results, lawsuits had run their course, and the Electoral College had voted. President Joe Biden’s inauguration was constitutionally inevitable.<br />The Trump camp was able to gin up false hope by exploiting ambiguities in the Electoral Count Act of 1887 (ECA). The law was intended to resolve contested presidential elections, but in the 21st century it has mainly been used by partisans in Congress to exploit the ceremonial process of counting electoral votes. Some Democrats took advantage of the ECA to cast doubt on legitimate results in 2001, 2005 and 2017, and far more Republicans did the same at Mr. Trump’s urging in 2021.<br />In the wake of the Capitol invasion, the ECA is ripe for an overhaul that reins in Congress’s increasingly destabilizing role in presidential elections. Repealing the law would make future challenges, even by the most willful candidates, less likely to spin out of control.<br />The ECA clashes with principles of federalism and the separation of powers. The Framers didn’t want the executive branch to be beholden to the legislative branch, so they designed an Electoral College to elect the President independent of Congress. Voters in each state register their choice for President by choosing a slate of electors, whose votes are then transmitted to Congress to be logged.<br />Yet the ECA allows Congress to unconstitutionally interfere with state decisions. Members of the House and Senate can claim electoral votes are not “regularly given” or “lawfully certified,” holding up the count and disqualifying electors if a majority in both houses agrees.</td>

      <td>A judge stops his deportation pause after the state of Texas sues.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump complained often about the frequency with which federal judges blocked his immigration orders, starting with his first sloppy travel ban in 2017. Now it’s President Biden’s turn, as a federal judge in Texas issued a temporary restraining order on Tuesday against Mr. Biden’s 100-day moratorium on deporting illegal aliens.<br />Judge Drew Tipton, a Trump appointee, issued the two-week TRO that applies nationwide and said he is considering a permanent injunction that would extend longer. The judge ruled on a suit filed by the state of Texas arguing that the deportation pause violates federal law that obligates the government to police illegal entry to the U.S. Judge Tipton said Mr. Biden’s order violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which is the same law that liberal judges used to issue nationwide injunctions against Mr. Trump’s rules.<br />The Biden Administration may appeal the ruling, and it pays to be skeptical these days when a judge issues a nationwide injunction. Too many judges have grown fond of the power to stop policies they don’t like. The truth in this case will require a more careful view of the legal arguments.<br />Meanwhile, the ruling is a blow to Mr. Biden’s early government by pen and phone, to borrow one of Barack Obama’s famous boasts. Mr. Biden’s pace of executive orders far outpaces Mr. Trump’s in his first week. Maybe he should slow down and make sure his orders are legally buttoned up.</td>

      <td>His ‘Buy American’ rules are even more protectionist.</td>
      <td>Businesses and workers hoping for a reprieve from Donald Trump's trade protectionism had a surprise this week as President Biden adopted his predecessor’s “Buy American” rules, only more so.<br />Rules that favor domestic companies in government procurement have been around since the New Deal. Mr. Trump issued three executive orders to toughen these requirements to promote U.S. manufacturing. Mr. Biden on Monday replaced those orders with his own supposedly tougher rules.<br />One rule would “increase the numerical threshold for domestic content requirements for end products and construction materials” and “increase the price preferences for domestic end products and domestic construction materials.” These thresholds vary by product, but increasing them will make government procurement more expensive and onerous.<br />About 97% of federal purchased goods are made by U.S. firms, but most include foreign-made components. U.S. auto makers source steel from Canada—often produced from U.S. scrap metal—engine components from Mexico, and computer chips from Taiwan. Mr. Biden wants to make federal contractors like Ford and  Caterpillar  buy more domestic components. But manufacturers require specific inputs and metal grades that are often only made abroad. Since the feds make up a tiny share of most U.S. companies’ sales, it doesn’t make sense to overhaul supply chains to comply with Made in America rules.<br />Mr. Biden says domestic content rules must be based on “the value that is added to the product through U.S.-based production or U.S. job-supporting economic activity.” But much of the value from tech equipment and even modern trucks derives from U.S. intellectual property. Will the Biden Administration refuse to buy iPads made overseas?</td>

      <td>His idea of ‘modernizing’ rules is to assert they have benefits that are ‘impossible to quantify.’</td>
      <td>Even in Washington, hardly anyone understands what the Office of Management and Budget does. Yet buried in the 2½-foot stack of President Biden’s first-day executive orders is hard evidence that someone in the new administration not only understands the OMB but knows how to use it. As a result, the business climate in this country will be made dramatically worse. Forget reregulation; this is the beginning of hyperregulation.<br />You probably didn’t pay attention to “Modernizing Regulatory Review,” a presidential memo released Jan. 20. Regulatory law is arcane and generally boring, but its effects can be monumental. Congress defers much of the actual work of governing—producing the rules and regulations that implement laws—to the executive branch. For decades the primary protection against an abuse of this power has been a requirement that a regulation’s costs must not outweigh its benefits. While each agency does its own cost-benefit analyses based on its own rules, OMB directs the agencies on how to do that and oversees the results. The new presidential memo tells OMB how to do that. The effects will filter down to every federal agency.<br />The presidential memo, similar to an executive order, is intended to “ensure that the review process promotes policies that reflect new developments in scientific and economic understanding, fully accounts for regulatory benefits that are difficult or impossible to quantify, and does not have harmful anti-regulatory or deregulatory effects” (emphasis added).<br />Translated from OMB-speak into English, that means throw out traditional measures, use anything you can possibly find to promote the benefit side of the cost-benefit analysis, and don’t do anything that might impair new regulation or remove old rules. The message from the Biden administration is that wherever cost-benefit analyses might create an impediment to regulation, OMB should feel free to throw out the math and use whatever it can find in the annals of some fringe academic journal to justify the new rules.<br />What is the scope of these changes? Pretty much everything: “These recommendations should provide concrete suggestions on how the regulatory review process can promote public health and safety, economic growth, social welfare, racial justice, environmental stewardship, human dignity, equity, and the interests of future generations,” the presidential memo instructs.</td>

Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. is set to name Ms. Brewer its next chief executive, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal, setting her up to be the only Black woman leading a Fortune 500 company today.<br />Ms. Brewer, 58 years old, has been COO and a member of the board at Starbucks since 2017. She helped shift Starbucks toward a focus on to-go operations during the pandemic and has worked to diversify the company’s leadership.<br />Starbucks last fall said it would tie executive compensation to increasing minority representation in its workforce, and mandated antibias training for company leaders.

In March, the company is expected to appoint investor Mellody Hobson as its chairwoman, positioning the coffee chain to be among the biggest U.S. companies with a Black person leading its board.<br />Starbucks’s president of its North American business and chief marketing officer will assume Ms. Brewer’s roles and report directly to Mr. Johnson, the CEO said on a call.</td>

      <td>Washington’s program is a success, and teachers unions want to defund it. What will Biden do?</td>
      <td>I welcome President Biden’s calls for unity and his pledge to renew our hurting country, but I hope his administration doesn’t tear down a program that has brought hope to thousands of African-American children in the District of Columbia.<br />In 2004, Congress created the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. It provides scholarships of up to $13,742 for families in the nation’s capital earning less than 185% of the federal poverty level—the cutoff was $48,470 for a family of four in 2020—to select the school of their choice. In 2020-21, 82% of scholarship recipients identified as African-American and another 12% as Hispanic.<br />While scholarships for poor children of color should hold bipartisan appeal, the program has been a political football for years. The Obama administration repeatedly attempted to zero out funding for the opportunity scholarships, stopping only when congressional Republicans threw up roadblocks. The 2020 Biden-Sanders “unity” platform went out of its way to recommend defunding the program.<br />Critics claim the program and others like it undermine public schools by diverting taxpayer money. I don’t believe that’s true of any scholarship program, but it’s demonstrably false about this program, which Congress funds outside public school budgets.<br />I strongly support both public education and school choice. I attended public schools, and my father served as the first African-American school administrator in Little Rock, Ark.—for which my family received a burning cross on our front yard. But when my youngest child struggled in public schools and his teachers called him “incapable” of learning, he deserved other options.</td>

      <td>Biden should resist the temptation to go big, and focus instead on solutions with bipartisan support.</td>
      <td>So, Joe Biden wants to give immigration reform a go. Good luck, Mr. President, but recent history is not on your side and the timing is questionable at best.<br />I write that as someone who has been calling for decades for immigration reform that includes both better border security and conditional legalization for people who sneaked in. Our immigration system was designed to accommodate the economic needs of the 19th century, not the 21st, and major revisions are long overdue. The past three administrations tried and failed to get the job done.<br />George W. Bush had planned to make comprehensive border reform a first-term priority. As a former governor of a border state, he knew the issue inside and out. But the 9/11 attacks, the Iraq war, and low job-approval ratings in his second term conspired against him. Barack Obama chose to undertake legally suspect executive actions on immigration instead of negotiating a deal with Republicans in Congress. Donald Trump spent four years touting his “beautiful wall” and thrilling his base with anti-immigrant rhetoric.<br />Mr. Biden’s immigration proposal prioritizes an eight-year pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented aliens currently living here. “Unlike previous compromise bills,” the Journal reports, “Mr. Biden’s proposal lacks the countermeasures of increased security or deterrence at the border that Republicans have asked for in exchange for legalization.” In other words, Mr. Biden is calling for amnesty now and more border security at some unspecified future date. This is like a boxer leading with his chin.<br />Besides, the amnesty debate is largely a side issue. Simply legalizing the status of these migrants—most of whom have been in the country for more than a decade—won’t solve the larger problem, which is the imbalance between the number of visas available and the number of foreigners who want them. After World War II, the federal government’s Bracero program extended work visas to Mexican migrants to address a U.S. labor shortage, and the rate of illegal immigration plummeted. The program had its problems but ought to serve as a template. The biggest failure of the 1986 amnesty under Ronald Reagan was that it did little to expand ways to come lawfully. Mr. Biden should avoid making the same mistake.</td>

      <td>The word turns out to have two interrelated meanings: comfort and entertainment.</td>
      <td>When I recently read an article about “the movies of 2020 that gave us solace,” I asked: How can a movie give me solace? Solace is giving comfort to people in need of it.<br />It turns out that my reasoning was faulty, because for roughly 700 years solace has had two different meanings. The Oxford English Dictionary’s first definition of the noun solace is “Comfort, consolation; alleviation of sorrow, distress, or discomfort” and also “that which gives comfort.” The OED quotes Thomas à Kempis, who says in “The Imitation of Christ”: “God alone . . . is the solace of many souls.”<br />The second meaning: “Pleasure, enjoyment, delight; entertainment, recreation, amusement.” This meaning, which the OED says has been obsolete for 300 years, also goes back to the Middle Ages. William Langland says in “Piers Plowman” (1377): “God in his goodness . . . set him in solace and in sovereign mirth.” In the prologue to “The Canterbury Tales,” the narrator says he wants the pilgrims to tell tales “of best sentence and most solas,” by which he means they should be entertaining.<br />It seems odd to think of solace as either an attempt to comfort someone, which is a serious undertaking, or an attempt to amuse someone by telling a good story. Maybe the first meaning drove out the second meaning because the two meanings seem incompatible. But are they?<br />Why not think of giving solace as both comforting a person and telling him an amusing story? Merriam-Webster doesn’t think the notion of solace as amusement is obsolete. Its second definition of the verb is: “to make cheerful, amuse.” It quotes Wilkie Collins’s narrator in “The Moonstone”: “In this deplorable state . . . I solaced myself with the most composing pipe of tobacco I ever remember to have smoked in my life.”</td>

      <td>A British ﬁreﬁghter seeks to revive an ‘early Labour tradition that spoke to the patriotic and communitarian instincts’ of blue-collar families.</td>
      <td>George Bernard Shaw, though a Fabian socialist, brushed aside anyone who called him a “friend of the working classes.” He scoffed that he “had no other feeling for the working classes than an intense desire to abolish them and replace them by sensible people.” A century ago Britain’s Labour Party brought together the Fabians (who supplied the policy wonks) and the trade unions (who supplied the voters). The party had been founded to give working people a voice in politics, but gradually control passed to the university-educated, who were internationalist, technocratic and supremely confident that they could plan the future.<br />Then came two awful shocks. In the 2016 Brexit referendum, the Remainers won the affluent vote, but the working classes carried the Leavers to victory. And in the 2019 parliamentary election, the Tories swept depressed factory towns that had heretofore been safe for Labour. “You can’t trust the people,” snorted novelist Howard Jacobson. That’s what happens when the rabble are “given this new confidence in their own opinions.”<br />Paul Embery might be called a populist in America, but a more accurate label is “left conservative.” A firefighter, union official and lifelong Labour activist, he writes for the resolutely unorthodox webpaper UnHerd. And in “Despised: Why the Modern Left Loathes the Working Class,” he suggests that Bernard Shaw’s enormous condescension is now the dominant ideology of the progressive intelligentsia, which embraces every subcategory of identity politics except class identity. The endless squabbling among fractious identity groups “serves only to fragment the working class and undermine what should be the primary goal of developing common bonds and building the maximum unity required to defend its interests.” Somehow, “inclusivity” doesn’t include the workers.<br />Mr. Embery protests that the British tradition of vigorous debate—deeply rooted in union halls and worker-education classes as well as in Parliament—has given way to “echo chambers, ‘safe spaces’ and draconian hate legislation, all of which serve the purpose of suppressing unwelcome opinions and enforcing an official orthodoxy.” Arguably the stifling began when Tony Blair told the Labour Party that globalization was not open to discussion: “You might as well debate whether autumn should follow summer.”<br />But globalization meant the dissolution of close-knit blue-collar communities, and that pains Mr. Embery profoundly. He grew up in the vast East London Becontree Estate. When it opened in the 1920s, this was a model public-housing project, miraculously offering indoor toilets, running water, front and back gardens and public libraries. Strict regulations ensured that curtains were kept clean and hedges were neatly trimmed, but residents accepted these rules because they were enforced by a democratic local government and because they reflected the thoroughly bourgeois values of the British working classes. Mr. Embery, born in 1974, still knows the names of all his old neighbors: “People looked out for each other, and there was a tangible social solidarity.”</td>

      <td>Pause announced on the president’s first day in office; judge says it violated Administrative Procedure Act</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the Biden administration’s 100-day pause on deportations, saying it likely violated the executive branch’s legal obligations for immigration enforcement.<br />U.S. District Judge Drew B. Tipton of the Southern District of Texas granted the request for a two-week temporary restraining order after the Texas attorney general sued the new administration last Friday to ensure deportations would continue to be carried out. Judge Tipton said his order applied on a nationwide basis.<br />The court order was the first legal setback to President Biden’s immigration agenda, which already is coming under attack from Republicans, much as former President Donald Trump’s policies were challenged by Democratic officials.<br />The Biden administration on its first day announced the 100-day deportation moratorium, which was pushed by immigration activists and Mr. Biden’s rival in the Democratic primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.). The Department of Homeland Security began enforcing the pause Friday.<br />Judge Tipton, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in 2020, issued the order after concluding that Texas was likely to prevail on some of its legal claims. The judge said he would soon consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction that would block the new policy for a longer period.</td>

Officials said they expect the additional doses to be delivered over the summer.<br />The purchases will provide enough supply to vaccinate 300 million Americans in a two-dose regimen over the summer.<br />Even with the increase in doses to states starting next week, supplies aren’t yet sufficient for what is needed, a senior administration official said.<br />“It’s going to take a number of months for us to be in a position for us to say to Americans it’s open season to sign up for vaccinations,” the official said.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The White House said Tuesday that President Biden held his first call as president with Russian President Vladimir Putin and raised concerns about issues including the detaining of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the massive SolarWinds hack and reports of Russia offering bounties on U.S. troops.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Mr. Biden reaffirmed America’s “strong support” for Ukraine’s sovereignty and addressed concerns about Russian interference in the 2020 election. The call also focused on plans to extend a U.S.-Russia nuclear arms treaty for five years.<br />Mr. Biden voiced criticism of Mr. Putin throughout his presidential campaign, and the call represented his first opportunity as president to seek to establish a break from the frequently warm rapport between former President Donald Trump and the Russian leader. Mr. Biden, who as vice president held a face-to-face meeting with Mr. Putin in 2011, has warned Moscow that it could face additional sanctions for election interference if it is confirmed by U.S. intelligence officials.<br />During Mr. Trump’s presidency, some Democratic lawmakers accused the administration of pulling its punches against Moscow, as Mr. Trump rejected intelligence findings of Kremlin election interference. But Mr. Trump countered that his administration had levied more sanctions against Russia than previous administrations.<br />In the days before Mr. Biden’s inauguration, the Trump administration sanctioned seven men, including several former Ukrainian officials, for allegedly interfering in U.S. elections as agents of Russia’s government by promoting theories about Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter.</td>

Those flags are blocking lenders’ ability to move forward second loans for the borrowers, after the program reopened this month.<br />“If you’ve got your fraud mitigation hat on, that’s not all bad,” said Tony Wilkinson, chief executive of the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders trade group. “But some of these businesses are hanging on by a thread and some of them needed the money yesterday.” Mr. Wilkinson said some of the flags are related to errors with basic data entry.<br />The SBA says it is working to remove the roadblocks. It is holding a national call Tuesday afternoon to help participating PPP lenders understand how to resolve the flags.</td>

Pittman said that by Jan. 4 the Capitol Police saw that the rally carried “strong potential for violence,” with extremists likely to attend.<br />“We knew that militia groups and white supremacists organizations would be attending,” Ms. Pittman told the House Committee on Appropriations, according to a copy of her testimony. “We also knew that some of these participants were intending to bring firearms and other weapons to the event. We knew that there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target.”<br />Ms. Pittman said on Jan. 4 her predecessor, Steven Sund, requested the Capitol Police Board, which oversees the department, declare a state of emergency and authorize a request for the National Guard to support the department’s officers.<br />The board denied the request, she said, and instead told Mr. Sund to contact the D.C. National Guard, which she said he did. Mr. Sund also coordinated with acting Police Chief Robert Contee at the Metropolitan Police Department, she said.</td>

      <td>President is expected to launch his health-care agenda by reversing two Trump actions, and is likely to seek expansion of health law</td>
      <td>President Biden on Thursday will begin shaping his health-care agenda by lifting certain restrictions on abortion funding and relaunching Affordable Care Act insurance sign-ups, moving swiftly to reassemble components of the health law weakened by the former Trump administration, according to a person familiar with the planning.<br />Mr. Biden will sign executive orders directing the reopening of enrollment on the ACA’s federal exchanges and rescinding a Trump administration policy that blocked federal funds to nongovernmental agencies that provide abortion counseling or referrals, the person said.<br />Mr. Biden will also initiate a review of a Trump administration decision that cut off federal funding for family-planning organizations such as Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the person said. The Trump administration cut off funding to organizations that refer patients for abortions, and Planned Parenthood left the program known as Title X. An action related to Medicaid, a federal-state program for low-income and disabled people, is also expected.<br />While Mr. Biden agreed with some of Mr. Trump’s health-care initiatives, such as ending surprise medical billings and some antitrust actions to curb market concentration in the industry, the actions coming Thursday are aimed at unraveling his predecessor’s stamp on health care. The moves are spurring criticism from conservative and antiabortion groups that have opposed the ACA and lauded restrictions on federal funding for abortion.<br />Mr. Trump had pledged to repeal the ACA and replace it with a better alternative but failed to do either. He supported key parts of a lawsuit from a coalition of Republican-led states to invalidate the ACA, which the Supreme Court is weighing.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Nearly all Senate Republicans voted to endorse the idea that impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump are unconstitutional, a blow to Democrats’ hopes of recruiting significant GOP support for conviction in the trial set to begin in two weeks.<br />In the 55-45 vote Tuesday to table, or kill, a procedural motion declaring the trial unconstitutional, five Republicans voted to table the motion, siding with all Democrats that the trial should proceed. The five were Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.<br />Forty-five Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, voted to support the assertion of Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) that the impeachment trial of a now-private citizen violates the Constitution and therefore is not in order.<br />A conviction at the conclusion of the trial would require 17 Republicans to join all 50 Democrats to reach the two-thirds supermajority required.<br />Mr. Paul wrote earlier this week that the impeachment trial was “a farce and should be dismissed before it is even allowed to begin.” After the vote, Mr. Paul said the roll call showed that there aren’t enough Republican senators willing to convict Mr. Trump.</td>

      <td>German auto giant is trying to overturn a lower-court ruling that could open the car industry to oversight from municipalities</td>
      <td>German auto giant  Volkswagen AG  is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that it says opens up car makers to a flood of emissions regulations from local governments that could clash with existing federal rules.<br />The request to the high court, filed last week and made public Tuesday, is the latest turn in litigation that has dogged Volkswagen since it admitted in 2015 to rigging 11 million diesel vehicles world-wide with software that allowed them to evade government emissions tests. The company has paid more than $30 billion in fines and settlements because of the scandal, including some $23 billion in the U.S.<br />At issue is a June decision by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that ruled two counties have authority alongside the federal Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the updates that car manufacturers make to emissions systems in vehicles after they are sold. Florida’s Hillsborough County and Salt Lake County in Colorado are seeking daily penalties of $5,000 per rigged diesel car for the local pollution they caused, with potential yearly damages of $11.2 billion.<br />Volkswagen argues it shouldn’t have to pay those fines because the court decision misinterprets the federal Clean Air Act, which it says gives sole regulatory authority over manufacturer changes to car emissions to the EPA and California. The company argues that the EPA approved a software update Volkswagen made to the cars before the diesel-emissions scandal broke, and that its move isn’t akin to something a county could regulate, such as a local mechanic tampering with emissions.<br />To date, the company has entered into $23 billion worth of civil and criminal settlements with federal and state regulators and drivers of nearly 600,000 U.S. diesel vehicles. Those agreements didn’t prevent some states and local governments from separately suing Volkswagen, lawsuits the company has won in Alabama, Tennessee and Minnesota.</td>

A spokesman for Verizon said the network suffered degraded service, which caused some high-bandwidth applications to stop working. A separate fiber-optic line cut in Brooklyn interrupted broadband service for about 1,000 customers but wasn’t tied to the region’s broader network issues, according to the spokesman.<br />Network engineers writing on public message boards reported trouble reaching Verizon and other services that rely on its systems from roughly 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time through the early afternoon.

      <td>New strains of the coronavirus are prompting strict new rules for international travel, further complicating what was already a nearly impossible feat.<br />Global air traffic is severely depressed, in large part due to a maze of ever-changing travel rules around the world. International passenger demand in November was down 88% from year-earlier levels, according to the latest figures from the International Air Transport Association.<br />But as health officials worry that new coronavirus variants may be more contagious, more deadly or less responsive to vaccines, governments are taking measures ranging from outright bans on international flights to universal testing requirements in effort to contain further spread.<br />Jeffrey Ward, a travel adviser who helps people plan luxury trips, said the biggest fear for many travelers residing in the U.S is getting stuck abroad if they test positive for Covid-19, given new U.S. rules requiring passengers to test negative before boarding a flight. He has steered some toward Hawaii for their beach vacations instead of international destinations. The state requires a negative test to enter, but U.S. visitors won’t need a second test to return home.<br />“People are freaking out,” Mr. Ward said.</td>

      <td>President Biden’s record-setting first day of executive orders contributed to a foreboding sense that red-blue unity was possible only if conservatives moved far left.</td>
      <td>Your editorial “Biden’s Unity Address” (Jan. 21) gives President Biden the benefit of the doubt regarding his desire to bring red- and blue-state Americans together. Did anyone expect a call for disunity? As to whether skepticism is appropriate, recall that six months ago he declared unity with Sen. Bernie Sanders and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Mr. Biden’s supporters issued a 110-page set of mutually agreeable policy plans—or as National Public Radio called it last July, “a blueprint for a progressive presidency.” Sen. Sanders gushed that, “On issue after issue, whether it was education, the economy, health care, climate, immigration, criminal justice, I think there was significant movement on the part of the Biden campaign.” Some of us on the right suspect that policy plans halfway between Sen. Sanders and President Biden have zero unifying appeal to red-staters.<br />President Biden’s record-setting first day of executive orders contributed to a foreboding sense that red-blue unity was possible only if conservatives moved far left. For example, “noncitizens” in the U.S. (primarily people who crossed the U.S. border illegally) will be included in the census count used to apportion congressional representatives. The more noncitizens hosted by a state, the more power that state has in Congress and the more federal funds it is likely to receive. Priorities of the Biden-Sanders unity plan include massive investment in green infrastructure, a new public-health insurance option, Medicare-for-60 (instead of 65), installation of a half-billion solar panels and unionization of jobs in the clean-energy economy. If red-blue unity is centered on Biden-Sanders unity, no thanks. NPR concluded last July that a Biden presidency will arrive “with bold progressive ambitions.” Wrapping bold progressivism in red-blue unity garb is unappealing to about half the country.<br />Dana Davis<br />St. Augustine, Fla.<br /></td>
