      <td>Online-dating company  Match Group Inc.  has reached an agreement to acquire South Korean social-media company Hyperconnect for $1.73 billion, broadening its services beyond connecting people in their love lives.<br />The cash-and-stock deal, announced Tuesday, marks Match Group’s largest acquisition to date.<br />Hyperconnect, based in Seoul, has developed two video apps that focus on helping people interact one-on-one and with new communities. Hyperconnect’s first app, Azar, offers live video and audio chat and can instantly translate voice and text for users that speak different languages. Hyperconnect’s other app, Hakuna Live, is a social live-streaming app that provides group video and audio broadcasts.<br />The apps broaden Dallas-based Match Group’s software offerings to include linking casual friends. Match operates several dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge and OkCupid, as well as its namesake brand.<br />The pandemic has fueled demand for apps that help people connect. Rival dating-app company Bumble Inc. is preparing a public listing with a valuation expected in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion.</td>

      <td>Corn, cattle farmers tell WSJ Global Food Forum that prioritizing trade would help reduce the need for government aid</td>
      <td>U.S. farmers said new trade deals are critical to help boost agricultural producers after the disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic and the Trump administration’s trade battles.<br />Firming up existing trade agreements and joining with multicountry trade pacts would give U.S. producers better prices for some products than they can get domestically, farmers said at the WSJ Global Food Forum. Farmers said giving priority to trade would help reduce the need for government aid, which climbed to a record level in 2020 as the Trump administration sought to stem losses from the U.S.-China trade war and the food-supply chain was upended by the pandemic.<br />“If we don’t have trade we’re not going to get the full value of what we’re selling,” said Kimberly Ratcliff, a Texas cattle rancher.<br />Mr. Trump’s tenure was a turbulent time for U.S. farmers, who have grown more reliant on selling their crops and meat overseas as domestic production outstrips the appetites of U.S. consumers. Duties the Trump administration levied on goods from China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union sparked retaliatory tariffs targeting U.S. agricultural products from pork to soybeans to apples, cutting into U.S. agricultural exports and sending farm commodity prices plunging.<br />President Biden said during his campaign that he would scale back trade disputes and align like-minded countries to push nations, including China, to engage in fairer trade practices. That approach could limit China’s ability to target U.S. farm goods with retaliatory tariffs, Mr. Biden’s campaign said, protecting U.S. farmers from market swings.</td>

      <td>The Securities and Exchange Commission said it wants to put GPB Capital Holdings LLC under a court-appointed monitor to prevent further misconduct by the firm, which is at the center of an alleged $1.7 billion Ponzi-like scheme.<br />In a court filing, the agency said a monitor is needed to protect investor assets and prevent the New York private-equity firm from disposing of assets that could be used to recover investors’ capital. The agency made the request Monday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn.<br />GPB Capital’s founder and former chief executive, David Gentile, as well as associates Jeffry Schneider and Jeffrey Lash, were arrested on criminal fraud and conspiracy charges last week in connection with what the authorities said was a scheme to deceive some 17,000 investors in four GPB funds, including two that invested in auto dealerships.<br />“The principal source for potential investor recovery is revenue generated by the several dozen automobile dealerships owned by GPB Capital,” the SEC said in a court filing to support its request for an independent monitor. “These dealerships have contractual relationships with lenders and manufacturers that are now at risk of termination because of, among other things, Gentile’s arrest.”<br />Mr. Gentile stepped down as CEO of GPB Capital on Friday, the day after the charges were brought against him in federal court, but the firm indicated the move was temporary and named Rob Chmiel, its chief financial officer, as interim CEO. Mr. Gentile owns GPB Capital.</td>

      <td>Kyle Allen and Kathryn Newton play teenagers stuck in a ‘Groundhog Day’-like time loop.</td>
      <td>‘Groundhog Day” was released in theaters 28 years ago (Feb. 12, 1993) and has only grown in stature over the years; it ranks alongside “Rashomon” as a 20th-century-born archetype of cinematic storytelling. Imitations, naturally, abound: Last year’s “Palm Springs” was yet another variation on the theme. But when a movie comes right out and acknowledges its debt—as does “The Map of Tiny Perfect Things”—it does a lot to win you over.<br />“Wasn’t there a movie…?” asks Henry (Jermaine Harris), as his friend Mark (Kyle Allen) tries to explain the “temporal anomaly” he’s found himself in—the same day on an endless loop, the same lottery number winning, Henry regularly losing the same videogame every time they hang out. Yeah, yeah, Mark answers, acknowledging the “Groundhog” question, but knowing, too, that Henry won’t remember their conversation tomorrow—or whenever it is. And that the video aliens Henry is facing off against will, for the umpteenth time, blow his avatar’s head off.<br />Based on a short story and screenplay by Lev Grossman and directed by Ian Samuels, “The Map of Tiny Perfect Things” introduces Mark like he’s the smiling steel ball in a Rube Goldberg contraption, rolling by and through events and people in such a seamless, choreographed manner it suggests he’s prescient, or a complete wise guy, or some kind of delinquent. Then one realizes that he’s done and seen the same thing so many times that he has everything timed to the split second. And he knows every move. By everyone. He even carries a pair of tongs in his back pocket on his way to school to straighten, surreptitiously, the skirt of a woman whose slip is showing. Every day.<br />The inescapable distraction with a film like “The Map of Tiny Perfect Things” is the search for the logical holes in the fabric of the story. If a certain thing happens today, one asks oneself, can it happen again…today? We don’t know how long Mark’s been stuck, but he’s got everything rehearsed to such a T that it might be years. Is he getting older? Is anyone else?<br />The larger hiccup in one’s digestion of Mr. Grossman’s storyline is Mark’s discovery of Margaret (Kathryn Newton, “Big Little Lies”), who is also trapped in time but wants little to do with Mark—she won’t even discuss how they got into their time bubble, or how to get out. Margaret knows more than she’s telling. Mark is intrigued by the ripple Margaret has caused in his time-space-romance continuum.</td>

Lyft’s bottom line was buoyed by aggressive cost cuts that included furloughing workers, trimming salaries and other operational changes, resulting in cost savings of $360 million last year, President John Zimmer said in an interview.<br />“We used an incredibly tough year to set us up for long-term growth,” Mr. Zimmer said Tuesday, reiterating that the money-losing company is on track to post a profitable quarter on an adjusted basis by the end of this year.<br />Lyft’s stock has more than doubled since Nov. 2, lifted by Covid-19 vaccine distribution and a big regulatory win in its home state in that month<br />Lyft posted fourth-quarter revenue of $570 million, slightly higher than in the preceding three months, but down 44% from the year-earlier period.

      <td>A Discovery+ documentary re-examines the sensational 2013 murder trial that turned the accused into a public villain.</td>
      <td>Jodi Arias was young, beautiful and by every indication a ruthless murderer, a combination that made her not only an object of media fascination when she went on trial in 2013 but of public vilification that seemed to take on a life of its own. It was a sensational case—Arias, now serving life without parole, had presented a number of wildly different stories at the beginning of the investigation, wound up testifying to her own disadvantage for 18 days, and was at the center of an event that was widely considered a circus. It was a sordid affair, but the way it occupied the intersection of criminal justice and the media gave it a special place among capital cases,<br />“If I Can’t Have You: The Jodi Arias Story” is certainly a Jodi Arias story—it offers, among other new details, glimpses of Arias’s journal entries and interviews with friends of Travis Alexander, the ex-boyfriend businessman murdered in 2008. It offers up gory if not overly gruesome crime-scene photos; it explores Alexander’s Mormonism and the way it affected the couple’s relationship and the case; it examines the unfaithfulness and jealousy that provided motive (hence the series title). If there’s a message being sent by Discovery+, it’s that the new streaming service will remain faithful to the stuff that has made Investigation Discovery a destination for true-crime devotees (while also offering Animal Planet, Food Network, HGTV, OWN, TLC, Travel Channel and other Discovery Inc.-affiliated outlets). The Arias case, after all, is the kind of well to which one can return time and again, without running dry of appalling minutiae.<br />This may be part of the strategy behind the two-part program, whose producers seem to be hedging their bets. One of the principal interviewees is attorney Jennifer Willmott, a member of the Arias defense team and one of the lawyers who saved a widely disparaged client from the death penalty. (The jury had voted 8-4 in favor of execution before a deadlock was declared.) Much of the miniseries is devoted to the self-defense strategy that was put forth by Ms. Willmott and L. Kirk Nurmi (whom Arias sued after he wrote a book about her case. He was later disbarred.). Their defense included accusations of abuse against Arias both by her father and by Alexander. As explained toward the end of episode 2, there are hopes that Arias will be granted a new trial based on the media coverage of the first, the unexplored aspects of the investigation, and the misbehavior of the prosecutor, former Maricopa County deputy attorney Juan Martinez. (He too was disbarred, last year, and appears in the show.)<br />While the public loathing of Arias is made quite plain at the beginning of episode 1, it’s not until late in the game that the details of the Alexander murder are revisited. Alexander was stabbed at least 27 times (the exact number seems to be disputed). His throat was cut. He was shot in the head. Self-defense can be argued. So can abuse. What “If I Can’t Have You” doesn’t want to argue very strenuously is vicious premeditated murder, because it may well be that we have not seen the last of Jodi Arias. And smart producers burn no bridges.</td>

      <td>I look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats alike on making our democracy more accessible.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “Didn’t Vote? Here’s Your $20 Fine” (Feb. 5): In January, I suggested that voting should be considered a civic duty. The response has been a bit surprising. The editorial board questions whether there was an inherent benefit to high voter turnout. One of my colleagues told a talk radio host that I was looking to establish “voting police.” With fervor, conservatives have risen to the defense of every citizen’s right to disengage from civic life.<br />Our government expects all citizens to engage in a variety of activities for the national benefit: selective service, jury duty, the census and taxes all come to mind. Liberals and conservatives alike recognize that those institutions are so vital to our national livelihood that they cannot be built on a voluntary basis. But no activity is more core to the American project than voting. There is no benefit to low turnout. An uncast ballot is not an ideological triumph—it is merely an indication that our democratic government is not as representative as it ought to be. Perhaps that’s why 26 successful democracies, e.g., Australia, already have enacted civic-duty voting.<br />Still, I knew that such a bold reform would not become law anytime soon. Sadly, our country isn’t ready for it.<br />In Connecticut, I’m fighting for early voting, no-excuse absentee ballots and other reforms to make democracy more accessible. In pushing for these changes, Democrats often mention the very people whom you identify as less likely to vote—“busy single moms, apolitical 19-year-olds, the homeless”—as a reason to modernize our laws. Frustratingly, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle roll their eyes and claim that any citizen can figure out a way to cast a ballot.<br />So I called their bluff. I proposed civic-duty voting, and people on the right became newly concerned with voter access. They actually admitted that some citizens may not have convenient access to the ballot.</td>

      <td>As Mr. Riley states, equality can be interpreted as equal opportunity, while equity can assume an equal outcome</td>
      <td>Jason Riley’s “Progressives Put the Racial ‘Equity’ Squeeze on Biden” (Upward Mobility, Feb. 3) touches on the importance of controlling the narrative. The “E-word” used to stand for equality. But over the last few years diversity, equality and inclusion initiatives now speak to equity. Why the difference? As Mr. Riley states, equality can be interpreted as equal opportunity, while equity can assume an equal outcome, that a society’s wealth is owned in common and not primarily by those who create it. Equity means everyone has an equal share of the pie regardless of the contribution.<br />The word equality has now been tacitly banned; it will soon be labeled a construct of white privilege intended to coerce people to hard work. But it’s hard to unlearn the old narrative. Mr. Riley quotes the president as saying: “this nation and this government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equity.” But listen to the audio. The president starts to say “racial equality” but catches himself in midword. He says: “racial equali . . . equity.” The old dog hasn’t fully learned the new trick. His trainers will make sure he does.<br />Fred Van Bennekom<br />Bolton, Mass.<br /></td>

Dissidents should never be linked to diplomacy over something as existential as nuclear war. If U.S. Presidents Nixon and Reagan had refused to negotiate nuclear-arms reductions with Russian leaders because of the way Moscow mistreated its dissidents, America’s most enduring nuclear treaties with Russia would never have helped both sides avoid nuclear war.<br />Mr. Biden’s decision to accept the longest possible extension (five years) of the New Start treaty without negotiating new conditions troubles you. Yet one of your complaints against the Iran nuclear accord in 2015 was that its limits on Tehran had expiration dates.<br />You argue that Russia violates arms accords. Yet we Americans pulled out of the 1972 missile-defense treaty and the 1987 intermediate-range missile treaty with Moscow. Treaties cannot be made with enemies willing to cheat, according to you.

      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Senate Democrats are pushing to include an increase in the federal minimum wage in their Covid-19 relief package, despite reservations from some in the party and other potential hurdles.<br />House Democrats this week unveiled a coronavirus relief package that included a provision to raise the federal minimum wage over time to $15 per hour, up from its current level of $7.25 per hour. In the Senate, however, procedural rules for passing legislation without GOP support raise complications for Democrats hoping to quickly move a minimum-wage increase, and at least one Democrat—Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia—has said he is opposed to the change.<br />Mr. Schumer indicated Tuesday that he was still hoping to pass it in the Senate.<br />“We’re trying to work as well as we can with the parliamentarian to get minimum wage to happen, that’s all I’m going to say,” Mr. Schumer said.<br />Both the House and Senate last week passed a budget outline, opening up a process known as reconciliation that would allow them to pass President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes required for most legislation. Democratic leaders have said they hope to secure some GOP support, but they are making plans to pass the legislation without it. Still, they can’t afford to lose any Democratic votes in the evenly divided Senate.</td>

      <td>FOR THE PAST few weeks, I’ve been strapping on “smart” masks, a new breed of face-covering you have to plug in to charge each night or pair with a phone app. Their promise: superior, or at least geekier, pandemic protection. The brands behind them back up the claim with a dazzling range of snazzy features.<br />The AirPop Active+ Halo Sensor mask (above, $150, airpophealth.com), for instance, measures my breathing rate and alerts me when it’s time to change the disposable N99-equivalent filter. With a washable shell and rubber seal that molds to my face to minimize air leaks, the mask doesn’t feel scratchy like other medical-grade models I’ve tried.

      <td>PARIS—French financial cooperative BPCE said Tuesday it plans to buy out minority shareholders of its listed investment bank,  Natixis SA,  taking private the unit that has been plagued by bad bets and trading losses.<br />BPCE, closely held and one of France’s largest banking groups, said it has made a formal offer for the nearly 30% stake it doesn’t already own in Natixis for about €3.7 billion, equivalent to around $4.5 billion. It plans to delist the Paris-based investment bank.<br />The buyout is part of a reset strategy to rein in risk, cut costs, and restore confidence in the investment bank, analysts said.<br />The takeover would be the end of the road as a public company for Natixis, which was born through a merger in 2006 with aspirations to become an investment banking player on a global scale.<br />The bank repeatedly ran into trouble. It suffered badly during the 2008-09 financial crisis. The government merged its parents, the retail-lending cooperatives Banque Fédérale des Banques Populaires and Caisse Nationale des Caisses d’Epargne, creating BPCE, and rescued Natixis. Natixis later set aside nearly half a billion euros for its role directing investor cash to funds managed by disgraced financier Bernard Madoff.</td>

      <td>WARSAW—A Polish court has ordered two historians to apologize for identifying a town mayor as an accused collaborator who gave up Jews to occupying Nazi forces during World War II, potentially chilling discussion of the role some Poles played during the Holocaust.<br />Close to 3.2 million Polish Jews are estimated to have died during five years of Nazi rule. Decades of research have found that while many Poles risked their own lives to help Jews, others participated in or assisted the slaughter.<br />The ruling Law and Justice party has tried to limit discussion of the actions of Polish nationals in the genocide, warning that it considers any investigation into alleged complicity of Poles in the Holocaust as dishonoring Poland. It prefers to portray the country as a blameless victim of larger regional powers.<br />The party oversaw the introduction of a libel law in 2018 to punish anyone falsely accusing Poles of collaborating with the Nazis, despite objections from the U.S., Israel and some survivors from the Auschwitz concentration camp. “It is important to protect the good name of Poland and Polish people,” Polish President Andrzej Duda said at the time. “We have the right to our historical truth.”<br />Tuesday’s verdict, delivered by Warsaw district court, now threatens to widen the schism between the European Union’s executive in Brussels and more nationalistic-minded countries in the bloc’s east. The court found that a 1,600-page academic study, “Night Without End: Fate of Jews in Selected Counties of Occupied Poland,” had violated the libel law by documenting cases of Catholic Poles collaborating with the Nazi regime.</td>

      <td>Acquisition of Glu Mobile is videogame publisher’s latest attempt to buy into a difficult market</td>
      <td>Leveling up in mobile games doesn’t come cheap these days. For  Electronic Arts ,  the payoff could be worth the price.<br />EA announced Monday afternoon that it has struck a deal to acquire  Glu Mobile  for $2.4 billion in cash. It is the videogame publisher’s second billion-dollar deal in as many months, following its surprise $1.25 billion takeout of U.K.-based racing-game maker  Codemasters  in December. Glu is EA’s largest deal to date, beating out the $1.3 billion spent on PopCap Games in 2011.<br />That deal also represented the last major attempt by EA to boost its mobile business. Since the iPhone ushered in the era of touch-screen mobile gaming in 2008, EA has made several moves to establish its position in a market that many observers believed would overtake consoles and PCs as the most dominant gaming platform. Smaller deals such as the acquisitions of game makers Firemint and Chillingo in 2010 and 2011 gave EA some popular games at the time such as “Flight Control” and “Real Racing.”<br />But EA never developed a Midas touch for mobile. Part of the problem came from the evolution of the mobile business away from games based on paid downloads and toward free-to-play titles that generate revenue from in-game transactions. Case in point: While buying PopCap gave EA control of the pioneering match-three game “Bejeweled,” it was “Candy Crush” that later came to dominate that category. EA’s rival  Activision Blizzard  acquired “Candy Crush” maker King Digital in 2015 and now generates more than $2 billion a year in mobile net bookings. EA’s mobile net bookings were just $779 million in calendar-year 2020.<br />Including Glu would have brought that total to about $1.3 billion. Doug Creutz of Cowen estimates the deal will make EA the seventh-largest mobile-game publisher. But simply adding games such as “Kim Kardashian: Hollywood” and “Diner Dash” to EA’s roster won’t justify the effort; Mr. Creutz says the real question is whether EA can effectively use Glu’s talent to enhance its other mobile properties.</td>

Chief People Officer Brent Hyder said Salesforce’s changes would include revamping office layouts to increase collaboration space instead of having a “sea of desks.” Mock-ups of its new offices feature café-style seating, open-air conference areas and private nooks, with an emphasis on clean desks and social distancing.<br />“We’re not going back to the way things were,” Mr. Hyder said in an interview. “I don’t believe that we’ll keep every space in every city that we’re in, including San Francisco.”<br />Salesforce expects more than 65% of its workforce to come into the office only one to three days a week in the future, up from 40% before the pandemic. An unspecified number of additional employees would be fully remote.<br />The company is the largest private employer in San Francisco and occupies the city’s tallest building, known as Salesforce Tower, and others with similar names in cities including Indianapolis, New York and Chicago. The company declined to say how much its real-estate footprint might shrink as a result of its changes.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Wall Street’s main regulator will give more power to its enforcement staff to launch investigations, an early sign that it plans to become more assertive under the Biden administration.<br />The move by the Securities and Exchange Commission allows more enforcement supervisors to authorize investigations, permitting about 36 senior officials at the agency to subpoena companies and individuals for records or testimony. The agency during the Trump administration withdrew that authority from supervisors and allowed only two officials to approve new probes, saying it would result in more consistent decisions about which tips and complaints justified investigations.<br />“Returning this authority to the division’s experienced senior officers, who have a proven track record of executing it prudently, helps to ensure that investigative staff can work effectively to protect investors,” SEC acting Chair Allison Herren Lee said Tuesday.<br />The number of new investigations fell every year during the Trump administration, from 1,063 in 2016 to 827 in 2019, according to the most recent figures published by the SEC. The number of completed enforcement actions fell from 548 in 2016 to 405 in 2020, although it reached 526 in 2019.<br />Ms. Lee, who took over the agency last month when former Chairman Jay Claytonstepped down, earlier worked as an enforcement attorney based in the agency’s Denver office.

      <td>Setting policy at the state level seems to work better than letting cities jockey.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial will attract most of the attention this week, but perhaps the more important event for the country is the saga of Covid-19 vaccinations. The federal distribution of doses to the states hasn’t been an outright disaster, and neither have state efforts to put these doses into arms. After a slow start, there have been signs of progress in recent weeks. Still, governments could be doing better, and fixing what’s wrong can save many lives.<br />At the federal level, the main problems have been shifting information and poor advice to the states. On Jan. 12, for example, governors were told by then-Vice President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar that the Trump administration would be releasing its stockpile of reserved doses. Relying on this assurance, many governors announced that their states would begin inoculating residents 65 and older. But it turned out that there was no stockpile to release, and governors had to change course.<br />Such shifts undermine public confidence and can lead to bad policy. In early January, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said that residents 65 to 74 would probably have to wait until March to get vaccinated. Then, according to a Washington Post report, Robert Redfield, who was director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, went to Annapolis and urged Mr. Hogan to start vaccinating seniors immediately. President Biden’s incoming coronavirus czar, Jeffrey Zients, reinforced this suggestion.<br />In response, Mr. Hogan announced that Marylanders 75 and older could start getting vaccinated immediately, followed a week later by those 65 to 74. This quadrupled the state’s eligible pool to more than two million, about 25 times the state’s weekly allotment of doses. The result, predictably, was a public-relations nightmare, as seniors tried to register for vaccinations that they had no realistic prospect of receiving.<br />As residents of Maryland and other states know, trying to sign up to get vaccinated takes residents to a bewildering multiplicity of online portals ranging from state and local public websites to hospitals and medical centers, pharmacies, and even supermarkets with clinics. Much of this confusion is the result of a federal failure that went unreported until recently.</td>

New York, and the U.S. more broadly, has been the center of global financial power since the end of World War II, but it shouldn’t take its position for granted.<br />Most of the original NYSE listings were New York-based companies, their shares traded by New York-based brokers. Now, the companies and the brokers are global, connected electronically through out-of-state servers, transacting their business instantaneously. These global companies want the NYSE to serve them in the most efficient, least expensive way possible. We’ve proved, by pandemic-driven necessity, that we can close the physical trading floor on a moment’s notice and maintain service without missing a beat. Similarly, the broader financial-services industry shuttered offices and shifted workforces, without hiccups, to remote locations.</td>

The Trump administration blocked the company from accessing American technology and sought to persuade allies that Huawei’s telecom gear presented national security risks.<br />Huawei’s lawsuit said the FCC’s ruling in December exceeded its authority and was “arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, and not supported by substantial evidence.”<br />An FCC spokeswoman said, “Last year the FCC issued a final designation identifying Huawei as a national security threat based on a substantial body of evidence developed by the FCC and numerous U.S. national security agencies.

      <td>The deal, which updates health and safety protocols, brings back a couple of experimental features from 2020, but doesn’t include a DH in the National League or expanded playoffs</td>
      <td>With barely a week to spare until spring training starts, Major League Baseball has decided what the rules of the sport are going to be this season.<br />MLB and its players’ union reached an agreement on updated health and safety protocols that will govern baseball’s second pandemic season. The deal brings back a couple of experimental features from the truncated 2020 campaign: seven-inning doubleheaders and beginning all extra innings with a runner on second base.<br />But, at least as of now, the National League will not use the designated hitter in 2021 as it did last year. The expanded playoff format from 2020 will not return, either. Both ideas could well be part of baseball’s next collective bargaining agreement, however.<br />The new rules that are sticking around were implemented to keep games short and accommodate the anticipated spate of postponements caused by positive coronavirus tests.<br />The revamped extra-innings format is designed to prevent the marathons that ravage bullpens and often require upward of four hours to finish. This rule had the intended effect during last year’s 60-game slate: About 71% of all extra-inning games last year ended after just one additional frame and only 2.6% needed more than three. In 2019, 18% of extra-inning games went on beyond the 12th.</td>

      <td>Nissan signaled a willingness to partner with the iPhone maker on Tuesday, after Hyundai said it was no longer in talks</td>
      <td>Many questions hang over  Apple Inc.’s  car project, but one thing is increasingly clear: The project won’t fail for lack of credible production partners.<br />Nissan  is the latest car maker to signal its openness to a deal. As technology transforms the auto industry, “we need to take new initiatives” and “work with companies that are knowledgeable, with good experience, through partnership and collaboration,” said Chief Executive Officer Makoto Uchida on Tuesday. This was in response to a question about his willingness to partner with Apple at a press conference to discuss the Japanese car maker’s quarterly results.<br />Speculation about the established automotive industry’s role in an Apple car project has spread since Hyundai dropped the big news that it was in talks with the iPhone maker last month. On Monday, those discussions seemed to have broken down, but Hyundai’s stock is still up 23% this year. Apple might not rely on just one supplier, though, and has also held discussions with Japanese manufacturers, according to a report in the Nikkei newspaper last week.<br />Nissan stock has rallied in recent days. There was little in its quarterly results to justify the excitement: The company’s turnaround is moving forward, but it nonetheless downgraded its revenue expectations for its fiscal year through March, noting the global semiconductor shortage. Yet Nissan, among the Japanese auto makers, is “the most likely candidate to be in serious discussions with Apple,” according to Mio Kato, an equity analyst who publishes on the Smartkarma research platform. Having overexpanded in the U.S. in recent years, Nissan has spare capacity to fill.<br />It is far too early for investors to be betting on car-manufacturing contracts from Apple. Unlike smartphones, vehicles are safety-critical devices. Self-driving technology—a common feature in reports on Apple’s car project—is still in its infancy. Returns from companies involved in the smartphone supply chain have also been very volatile. Those who buy auto stocks for the Apple halo alone are setting themselves up for disappointment.</td>

      <td>Over-reliance on TSMC and soaring cost of old gear limits capacity expansion</td>
      <td>The production shortage plaguing the market for automotive chips is a combination of new and old problems, none of which can be easily solved.<br />Ford Motor  last week was the latest auto maker to show the fallout. The company said Thursday that it is cutting production by up to 20% in the first quarter due to its inability to procure enough chips. Rival General Motors said a day earlier that it planned to trim production at North American factories due to the shortage.  Volkswagen  sounded an early warning in December about the issue, which is affecting auto makers across the board that need chips to control everything from infotainment systems to power management to systems monitoring.<br />The problem stems from actions both recent and distant. A sudden drop-off in sales caused auto manufacturers to cut component orders early in the pandemic. Then demand rebounded at an unfortunate time as chip manufacturers were operating at capacity to produce components for hot, high-price items such as the latest generation of iPhones and artificial intelligence chips for data centers. Industry giant  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ,  or TSMC, said in its earnings call last month that the automotive market accounted for only 3% of its revenue in the fourth quarter compared with 51% for smartphones and 31% for high-performance computing chips.<br />The firm said on the same call that improving production for auto chips is a “top priority.” But the harsh reality is that chips for cars have to compete for manufacturing space with other products that generate a much higher return.  Nvidia ,  a major TSMC customer, sells some of its latest gaming processors for several hundred dollars apiece, whereas many of the microcontrollers used in the world’s automobiles can fetch a dollar or less. Even cheap chips can have expensive consequences, though. Stephen Sanghi, chief executive of auto chip supplier  Microchip Technology ,  noted in his own call last week that “a $1 part can prevent a $40,000 car from shipping.”<br />Chip fabrication plants generally take more than two years to set up and the soaring cost of building and equipping them has led more semiconductor companies to outsource more of their production needs. Renesas, NXP and  Infineon -Cypress, which together account for nearly 80% of the automotive chip market, all use TSMC for some of their manufacturing. The Taiwanese firm now produces about 70% of the microcontroller units used in the world’s automobiles, estimates Phil Amsrud of  IHS Markit .</td>

      <td>Total’s prudent management in recent years set it up well for the trauma of 2020</td>
      <td>French giant Total may be the best of a bad bunch in the unloved oil-and-gas sector.<br />The company weathered a traumatic year for the oil industry better than European peers  Shell  and  BP ,  annual results released Tuesday confirmed. The sector isn’t for the faint of heart as the world transitions to cleaner forms of energy, but Total seems well set up for a range of scenarios.<br />The company is the second-largest producer of liquefied natural gas, and added significant finds to its oil and gas reserves last year. Yet it is also developing a new-energy business. It has converted some refineries to biodiesel and is investing in renewable assets. It has trading and retail services, and is dabbling in batteries, electric-vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon-capture technologies.<br />So much activity could raise the risk of poor delivery, but Total’s results have been steady so far. It has the advantages of low production costs and a solid balance sheet. The company has been buying businesses in various industries around the globe for years, but resisted overextending itself, as Shell did with the 2016 purchase of BG Group. It also hasn’t had to digest the vast cost of large oil spills, as BP did with the disasters in Alaska in 2006 and the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.<br />Investors used to prize oil companies for their stable and growing dividends. Both Shell and BP cut their payouts as the pandemic hit oil demand, but Total didn’t and now offers a sector-leading 7.5% dividend yield. The payments are sustainable at a $40 a barrel oil price, management said.</td>

Depending on which report you read, investors injected between $12 billion and $20 billion into area startup companies.<br />So what’s getting funded in New York these days? Better to ask what isn’t getting funded. Among the rounds that closed in 2020: $47 million for a hair-loss-prevention service, $9 million for a company making human-grade cat food, $6.25 million for a podcast company focusing on romantic comedies and $150,000 for a maker of bathroom-cleaning robots.<br />And thanks to a big wave of IPOs and acquisitions, local venture capitalists and angel investors are swimming in cash and likely to continue the funding frenzy this year.<br />So here’s what I’m wondering: How can I get me some of that loot?<br />I asked industry insiders for tips. The good news: You don’t need to be a tech type, it seems, to impress a New York City VC. While the San Francisco Bay Area startup scene is dominated by nerds, startup founders in New York look a lot like, well, the rest of us. The people who get funding here often are escapees from industries such as finance, real estate, health care and retail.</td>

A fierce argument has erupted between well-known left-leaning economists about President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package, with warnings that it is so large it risks runaway inflation and the crowding out of other, more productive, spending plans.<br />The concerns being voiced by Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary to Bill Clinton and director of Barack Obama’s National Economic Council, and Olivier Blanchard, former IMF chief economist, are perfectly reasonable arguments. After all, it comes just weeks after a $900 billion stimulus by the departing president.<br />Yet, markets show no sign of concern, either in the average expectation of inflation implied by the bond market or the likelihood of very high inflation in the options market, both of which are merely back to where they stood in 2018.<br />Investors are predicting the sort of inflation they like, slightly higher in the next few years but moderating back down after that, and it’s helping stocks and commodities while limiting the pain to bondholders from rising yields.<br />Investors have four reasons to take comfort that are at least as good as Messrs.

He assailed the Democratic governor’s business closures and mask mandates, raising his profile in the process. He is now considering a run for governor next year.<br />State Sen. Jim Brewster, a Democrat, urged people to follow health guidelines and government rules, a stance he said nearly cost him his seat last November. A frequent party-crosser during his 10 years in office, he said the pandemic has changed how he views his fellow lawmakers. “I’m done working with people who have an agenda,” he said.<br />The public-health crisis approaching the one-year mark upended how Americans live. It has also deepened the divide between Republicans and Democrats at the national level, polls have shown, and in Pennsylvania, an electoral battleground where control of state government is split between the parties. That partisanship worsened after many locally elected Republicans supported former President Donald Trump’s unfounded assertions that the election was stolen from him.<br />“It was the perfect storm—an election year, people’s lives turned upside down from the long pandemic of things,” said state Rep. Torren Ecker, a Republican who represents part of south-central Pennsylvania. “It’s all led to some tension, to say the least.”<br />Politicians from both parties believe the rift started at the top: Republicans say Democrats focused on the pandemic as a way to make Mr. Trump look bad and went too far in placing restrictions on businesses. Democrats say Republicans followed Mr. Trump’s lead and didn’t take the virus seriously enough and pushed to prematurely reopen the economy.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—The jets that landed in Australia from China were made to look inconspicuous: no corporate logos to indicate that wealthy gamblers were inside.<br />According to a report released by an Australian regulator Tuesday, it was a deliberate attempt by an executive at Australian casino operator  Crown Resorts Ltd.  to evade the Chinese government, which in early 2015 had announced a crackdown on foreign casinos recruiting Chinese high-rollers to gamble overseas.<br />The plan didn’t work, and Chinese police later arrested 19 Crown employees, accusing them of gambling-related crimes. Tuesday’s report said Crown disregarded the welfare of its employees in China by pursuing lucrative high-rollers even as the Chinese police were closing in, and concluded that Crown isn’t suitable to hold a license for a new casino in Sydney without making significant changes to its corporate culture.<br />The 751-page report, based on 60 days of public hearings that included Crown executives, offers an unusually in-depth look at the inner workings of an industry that has a reputation for being anything but transparent. The report  also found that bank accounts at Crown’s subsidiaries were used to launder money. In addition, Crown worked with so-called junket operators in Asia to bring high-rollers to Australia, even after learning of allegations in media reports and the company’s own due diligence that those groups had ties to organized crime, the report said.<br />As early as 2014, Crown’s bankers raised warnings of suspicious deposits in its bank accounts, such as multiple deposits on the same day by the same person at different branches in the same city, the report said. But Crown at the time didn’t change how the bank accounts operated or were monitored, the report said. Account details were given to Crown patrons, whose deposits would be credited to their account at the relevant casino.</td>

It also shows how decades of immigration into Europe has transformed the continent’s demographics and is reshaping politics in unexpected ways.<br />The finding, in a new study by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a think tank linked to Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union shows a majority of people of migrant origin in the country favor conservative, free-market or even far-right parties.<br />“We are seeing a process of normalization,” said Viola Neu, the author of the study. As migrants become economically and culturally more integrated, get naturalized and gain the right to vote, they tend to shift support from the center-left to the center-right, she said.<br />“People with immigrant backgrounds now vote like the majority does—not as a group tied to their origin, but according to their values and personal preferences,” she added.</td>

Now they are stuck with shares that won’t pay off soon.<br />In 2018, an exclusive group of global private-equity firms and mutual-fund managers including Silver Lake, Warburg Pincus LLC,  Carlyle Group Inc.  and  T. Rowe Price Group Inc.  took part in a coveted fundraising by Ant that raised $14 billion and minted the financial-technology giant as the world’s most valuable startup.<br />More than $10 billion of the money came from international investors, which bought shares in an offshore shell company set up by Ant to raise funds in U.S. dollars. The unusual arrangement came about because in order to secure a payment license to operate Alipay, its highly popular mobile app, Ant had to be domiciled in mainland China. But that also limited the company’s ability to raise funds directly from foreign investors.<br />The global investors agreed to terms that were highly favorable to Ant, and which limited their ability to cash out if the company didn’t end up going public, according to people familiar with the matter. Ant also didn’t provide a listing time frame or guarantee investors a return while it stayed private, the people added.<br />The foreign investors didn’t receive any voting rights in Ant, which was valued at $150 billion in the June 2018 deal. None was given a seat on Ant’s board.</td>

      <td>The pandemic is compelling a number of co-working firms to discard original business models, or accelerate the adoption of a new one, with the broader office market under threat.<br />The original strategy, popularized by WeWork and many of its peers, involved leasing as much office space in city centers as possible, and then effectively subletting it to companies for a profit. This approach led to spectacular growth and sent WeWork’s valuation soaring to $47 billion.<br />With the majority of office employees still working from home during Covid-19, demand has plummeted. But co-working firms remain on the hook for the expensive long-term leases they signed during the boom years, and many are struggling to meet these obligations. Knotel Inc. became the industry’s biggest victim yet of this mismatch when it filed for Chapter-11 bankruptcy last month.<br />Now, some analysts suggest the pandemic is accelerating the end of the industry’s lease-and-sublet model. “The business model was similar to picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, which history has shown isn’t a sustainable strategy,” said Daniel Ismail, a senior analyst at research firm Green Street.<br />Instead, he expects revenue-sharing agreements to become more common. They are similar to the relationship between hotel owners and operators, where operators get fees and a share of profits but don’t have to pay rent. Revenue-sharing deals are considered less risky because they leave operators with lower fixed costs.</td>

Space Agency. “The best way to do that, from what we have been experimenting with as a nation, has been an exploration mission to space.”<br />In the most critical moment of its 306 million mile journey from Earth, which began in July with the launch of a Japanese rocket that lofted it into space, the Hope spacecraft on Tuesday was scheduled to fire its onboard thrusters for 27 minutes to reach a stable orbit around Mars. The maneuver was to be controlled autonomously by onboard computers, because the 22-minute time lag in radio transmissions between the craft and Earth made ground control impossible.<br />“It’s the first time we actually use all six thrusters and our whole control system,” mission project manager Omran Sharaf at the Emirates’ Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre in Dubai said in advance of the maneuver. “My feelings? Very very nervous. Extremely nervous. Worried. Scared. But I am also confident. Happy. Proud.”</td>

Mr. Aguzin, 52 years old, will take the helm of what is now the world’s most valuable exchange group, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, with a rally in its own shares lifting its market capitalization to around $85 billion.<br />Mr. Aguzin is an Argentine national who also holds a Croatian passport and has permanent residence in Hong Kong. He doesn’t speak Mandarin—unlike his Beijing-born predecessor Charles Li, who led HKEX from 2010 to the end of last year.<br />The appointment of a foreigner underscores the exchange’s global ambitions and its independence, amid concerns about Beijing’s growing influence on the city, said Paul Pong, managing director at Pegasus Fund Managers Ltd.<br />“It helps strengthen the image of Hong Kong as an international financial center,” said Mr. Pong. He said Mr. Aguzin’s strengths would be complemented by those of HKEX Chairman Laura Cha, who has strong connections in mainland China as a former vice chairman of China’s securities watchdog.</td>

About 8.5 million square feet of new space for warehouses, distribution hubs and fulfillment centers was delivered in the fourth quarter of last year, about double the amount in the same quarter of 2019, according to  Colliers International .<br />Vacancies jumped to 8.8% from 6.6% during the past year, Colliers said in a fourth-quarter 2020 report.

Online shopping volume had been growing at 15% annually up until the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the data analytics firm Green Street. Last year it increased by about 35%, Green Street said.</td>

      <td>Bank investors appear to be focused on expenses right now, but that might not be the right way to gauge which lenders will be best positioned for the future</td>
      <td>Banks and credit-card lenders need consumers to get spending. But they might need to do some spending of their own, too.<br />As credit measures continue to perform much better than feared, with still-low delinquency rates and rising loan-loss provision releases, investors seem to have found another reason to be worried about banks: their noninterest expenses. Fourth-quarter expenses at the very largest banks as a percentage of revenue rose by 3 points year over year on a median basis, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group. Out of 24 large banks’ earnings tracked by Autonomous Research, analysts’ consensus forecasts for 2021 expenses have risen for 22. Higher costs eat away at preprovision net revenue, which is already depressed by low interest rates and tepid loan growth.<br />It is true that banks have had their cost issues, highlighted recently by the recent focus on financial-crime monitoring, plus a continuing surge of fintech competition that forces banks to continually beef up their technology. But investors still may not be best served over the longer term by being too focused on margins right now, especially amid the earnings noise of the pandemic and its related effects. Certain spending today might be the key to outperformance in the post-pandemic future.<br />Card companies, in particular, ought to be viewed over a longer time horizon, given depressed customer spending in key categories such as travel. Take  American Express ,  for example: Falling expenses that vary with customer activity offset around 40% of the decline in the company’s revenue in the fourth quarter, down from about 50% earlier in 2020, the company said in January. But part of what was behind that smaller offset was an increased use of cardholder benefits—a sign that even as many spenders may not be doing the kind of shopping on travel and entertainment they once were, they still get value out of their cards. That is a possible sign of pent-up demand and a longer-term return to normal card behavior.<br />Likewise,  Capital One Financial  might look much more efficient at higher consumer-activity levels. The company said in January that some of its technology investment was aimed at more effective customer marketing, and it outlined a strategy of generating more new accounts now, with the longer-term aim of giving customers larger credit lines in a better economy. Credit cards are a rare kind of lending in which margins can stay strong even amid low rates, so banks will need to do a lot of it as demand returns.</td>

A sale could benefit Mr. Trump’s businesses, which have more than $400 million in debt due in the next few years.<br />Vornado Realty Trust  executives have recently had internal discussions about buying out the Trump Organization’s 30% stakes in an office tower in Midtown Manhattan and in a property in San Francisco’s financial district that the companies jointly own, people familiar with the matter said. Vornado tried unsuccessfully to sell the properties last year. A plan to refinance them was shelved.<br />When no buyers or lenders stepped up, the firm grew concerned that they were staying away because of the Trump Organization’s stake, said people familiar with the matter.<br />Vornado has weighed finding a reason to withhold income generated by the properties from the Trump Organization, a move that could force a confrontation that sends both parties to court and accelerates a separation, these people said.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—Hong Kong’s highest court has denied bail to pro-democracy newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai, the most prominent figure facing prosecution under a sweeping national-security law imposed by Beijing to silence opposition after a year of unrest.<br />The ruling means that Mr. Lai could potentially spend the rest of his life behind bars if convicted. The businessman and longtime critic of China’s Communist Party is charged with foreign collusion, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The decision also signals that courts will set a high standard for granting bail to anyone charged under the national-security law.<br />Mr. Lai, who is in his early 70s, is among a handful of defendants heading to trial under a law imposed last year—and was the only one so far that a judge had released on bail pending trial. His case is being watched closely in mainland China and in Hong Kong as a test of how the law will be enforced in the former British colony, which has largely governed itself and retained its U.K.-style legal system since its return to China in 1997.<br />China’s state-backed media reacted with outrage in December after a lower-court judge granted bail to Mr. Lai shortly after his arrest. Mr. Lai also faces a fraud charge. He denies the charges.<br />China’s Communist Party mouthpiece The People’s Daily called Mr. Lai dangerous and castigated local courts for misreading the national-security law, which sets strict conditions for bail. The column suggested mainland authorities might invoke new powers under the law to pull Mr. Lai’s case out of Hong Kong’s legal system and try him in the mainland.</td>

And Mr. Bononi’s income as a behavioral-health counselor isn’t enough by itself to cover their monthly mortgage payment of roughly $2,000 on top of their other expenses.<br />Mortgage forbearance has been a financial lifeline for many Americans navigating the pandemic-ravaged economy, allowing homeowners to eliminate what is often their largest bill for months at a time. But the relief programs, largely designed to last a maximum of 12 months, are set to expire in the coming months, a serious challenge for borrowers who are still out of work or are earning less than they did pre-pandemic.<br />More than half of 2.7 million active forbearance plans are set to end for good in March, April, May or June, according to mortgage-data firm  Black Knight Inc.<br />“The biggest concern in my eyes is the number of folks whose forbearance programs are going to end this spring,” said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at Haus, a home-finance startup. “Those that were hit the hardest early on and still haven’t found a job are going to be in dire straits.”</td>

Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, have previously sided with Democrats on a question related to the constitutionality of trying the former president.<br />The House voted to impeach Mr. Trump last month, alleging he encouraged the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 as part of a last-gasp effort to overturn President Biden’s election victory. The article of impeachment points to a speech Mr. Trump gave at a rally preceding the riot where he urged supporters to “fight” and march to the Capitol.<br />Sixty-seven votes are required to convict Mr. Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would need to join all 50 Democrats.

The number of postings to the site has grown since hitting a low in May, though the pace of new openings has slowed in recent months, Indeed said.<br />Industries that recovered quickly from the initial shock of the pandemic have led growth in job openings, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed. Those industries—such as warehousing, construction and delivery services—have held steady over the course of the pandemic.<br />Meanwhile higher-wage postings in technology and finance have recently picked up. “I think those are sectors that hire based on where they see the economy going longer term.” Mr. Kolko said. “Restaurants, beauty-and -wellness jobs and hair salons will hire pretty quickly if demand picks up but also might lay off people quickly.

Others are scoring shoppers based on their return rates, much the way credit-ratings firms tally consumers’ creditworthiness.<br />Behind the push is a painful economic reality of e-commerce.

Futures for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 index slipped 0.1%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average contracts drifted down less than 0.1%.<br />Investors said markets are taking a breather following a broad advance in stocks and commodities.

He discussed the plan with then-lead director Kenneth Duberstein and board member David Calhoun, now Boeing’s CEO, according to internal emails cited in the suit.<br />Around the same time, Boeing was publicly pointing to pilot and maintenance errors as important factors in the fatal plunge of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia, even as it was privately beginning work on a fix to an automated flight-control system implicated in that crash. The system, called MCAS, later also led to a second MAX crash in early 2019 in Ethiopia.<br />The new details, contained in a recently amended version of a shareholder lawsuit filed against Boeing’s board in Delaware’s Court of Chancery, included inner workings at the highest levels of the company as it became embroiled in one of the biggest corporate crises in modern American history. U.S. regulators late last year allowed the MAX to resume passenger flights, ending a nearly two-year grounding.<br />A Boeing spokesman on Monday said the company was seeking to dismiss the shareholders’ suit, which he said lacked merit. He said Boeing was dedicated to safety, quality and integrity and that the company’s senior management and board had engaged in “robust safety oversight,” including extensive reviews of engineering, airplane-development and production processes. He said Boeing had improved safety, quality and compliance since the MAX crisis.</td>

Previously it was valued at $3 billion after its last funding round in February 2019, according to PitchBook, a provider of private-market data. Current investors in Reddit also include venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and internet conglomerate  Tencent Holdings Ltd.<br />“It’s a good market to fundraise,” Reddit Chief Executive Steve Huffman said in an interview. “Valuations are very high right now. It never hurts to raise money when there’s an opportunity to do so and Reddit had a strong year.” For example, advertising revenue for the company shot up 90% in the December-ended quarter from a year earlier, he said.<br />The funding for Reddit comes just weeks after upstart audio-chat social network Clubhouse raised fresh capital. Clubhouse was valued at $1 billion last month after securing $100 million in a funding round led by Andreessen, according to PitchBook.<br />San Francisco-based Reddit, founded in 2005, is known for its message boards on a multitude of topics, as well as its “ask me anything” digital town halls with celebrities, politicians and subject-matter experts. The company, which isn’t profitable, was sold to Condé Nast in 2006, and the magazine publisher’s parent, Advance Publications Inc., spun Reddit off in 2011 and remains a shareholder. The company has raised roughly $800 million since 2011.</td>

      <td>Bogotá, Colombia—President Iván Duque’s conservative government said Monday that it will provide nearly a million undocumented Venezuelan migrants with temporary protected status, giving them the right to live and work in this country for 10 years.<br />Mr. Duque made the announcement after meeting with the head of the United Nations refugee agency, which has pressed Latin American countries to legalize and provide services for millions of Venezuelan who have fled an economic crisis that has worsened under President Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian rule.<br />“We hope that other countries follow our example,” Mr. Duque said at a news conference in which he cited Pope Francis’s calls for countries to help and not turn back migrants fleeing wars and deprivation.<br />Mr. Duque, a leading opponent of the Maduro regime, called the measure an act of solidarity with struggling Venezuelans. “We have to take actions—not actions based on fear or rejection, but with fraternity,” the president said.<br />Colombia has taken in more than 1.7 million Venezuelans, hundreds of thousands of whom are here legally. They make up roughly one-third of the more than 5 million Venezuelan refugees dispersed around the region, according to the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration.</td>

      <td>They already know the result, but they think it will hurt the GOP.</td>
      <td>The Senate on Tuesday begins the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, now the former President. Democrats say the trial is crucial to punishing Mr. Trump for the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, but it seems more likely to do the opposite by acquitting him. It also looks like a needless partisan exercise that will further polarize America’s political factions.<br />As we’ve said several times, Mr. Trump’s actions that day and after the November election were disgraceful. He made false claims about a stolen election and later about overturning the Electoral College count. He also misled his supporters about Vice President Mike Pence’s solely ceremonial role in presiding over the vote count.<br />By rallying his supporters to march on the Capitol in the false hope of overturning the election result, and then refusing for hours to ask them to stand down, Mr. Trump tolerated an assault on a constitutional branch of government. Republicans who think this is impeachable conduct will get no criticism from us.<br />Yet the House impeachers don’t limit themselves to that charge. In their single and sloppy impeachment article, they accuse Mr. Trump of “incitement of insurrection.” This is a stretch, not least because Mr. Trump called on the marchers to behave “peacefully.” The House managers mention this only in passing in their trial brief. It is doubtful that Mr. Trump’s Jan. 6 remarks would qualify as incitement under the criminal code.<br />The assault on the Capitol was a riot, and a violent one, but it wasn’t an “insurrection.” It wasn’t a coup. Law enforcement was overwhelmed but it was all on the side of the Congress. Once the mob was dispersed, the Members returned to the House chamber to count the votes. There was never any chance that Joe Biden would not become President on Jan. 20, whatever the fantasies of Mr. Trump and his courtiers.</td>

      <td>How many jobs for the young and unskilled do Democrats want to lose?</td>
      <td>President Biden says his priority is creating new jobs and he wants “to grow the economy for all Americans.” But look at how the Congressional Budget Office sizes up his proposal for a $15 federal minimum wage. Phasing in this mandatory wage floor by 2025, according to the CBO’s new average estimate, would result in a loss of 1.4 million jobs.<br />The idled workers would be disproportionately younger and less educated, and CBO projects that half of them would drop out of the labor force. Prices would also rise for goods and services that rely on entry-level labor, “such as food prepared in restaurants.” The federal budget deficit through 2031 would increase $54 billion, CBO says, as the government spent more on unemployment benefits and health-care programs.<br />Low-wage employees lucky enough to keep their jobs would get a raise. CBO says 17 million workers would be “directly affected” by the $15 minimum, and poverty “would be reduced by 0.9 million.” This is not a free lunch, no matter how often Mr. Biden and Bernie Sanders say so. Those gains would come at a high cost for the young and unskilled who will have a harder time grabbing the first rung of the economic ladder.<br />Even those figures are a guess, since setting the minimum wage at a high of $15 would essentially put the country through an economic experiment. This would mean imposing the urban labor costs of San Francisco and Manhattan on every out-of-the-way gas station in rural America. The U.S. economy is made up of local and regional labor markets with prevailing wage rates that depend on varying standards of living, the kinds of employers, and the availability and skill of the workforce. Some 20 states have a minimum wage no higher than the current national minimum of $7.25.<br />The good news is that the $15 wage’s route through Congress looks bumpy. Mr. Biden told  CBS  he’s willing to push a $15 wage floor in separate legislation, but he doesn’t think it’ll pass buried in his $1.9 trillion Covid bill: “Apparently that’s not going to occur because of the rules of the United States Senate.”</td>

It shouldn’t be hard to meet the organization’s expectations. Well over half of its members “fail to meet the minimal standards of a free democracy,” according to UN Watch.<br />Last fall Cuba, Russia and China were elected to the 47-seat body. Moscow won its seat after poisoning opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has since been imprisoned on trumped-up charges. The Chinese Communist Party-sponsored genocide in Xinjiang wasn’t enough to stop its accession, though its margin of victory narrowed from previous years. Cuba’s long history of repression didn’t matter.<br />Like so many other U.N. institutions, the council also has a malign obsession with Israel. It has condemned the Jewish state some 90 times since its founding in 2006. No other country comes close. By UN Watch’s count, Syria and North Korea earned 13 and 35 condemnations. Russia and China? Zero.<br />Mr. Blinken at least acknowledged “that the Human Rights Council is a flawed body, in need of reform to its agenda, membership, and focus, including its disproportionate focus on Israel.” But these problems are endemic and predictable: Membership is based on a vote in the General Assembly, not on real standards of human dignity or freedom.</td>

But the breach highlights the exposure of utilities to cyberattacks.<br />“Water systems, like other public utility systems, are part of the nation’s critical infrastructure and can be vulnerable targets when someone desires to adversely affect public safety,” said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri at a news conference Monday about the incident.<br />The hacking began on Friday morning at the plant in Oldsmar, a city of about 15,000 people in the Tampa Bay area, Sheriff Gualtieri said. Around 8 a.m., a plant operator noticed that someone remotely accessed a computer system he was monitoring that controls chemicals used to treat water as well as other functions. The computer system has a software program that allows authorized users to access it remotely.<br />The intrusion was brief, and the operator didn’t think much of it because his supervisor and others remotely access his computer screen to monitor the system, Sheriff Gualtieri said. Then at around 1:30 p.m. Friday, someone again entered the system remotely. A plant operator observed the intruder opening various software functions that control the water being treated in the system, the sheriff said.</td>

Saudi Arabia, with U.S. assistance, has led a coalition to support the country’s internationally recognized government. Democrats and some isolationist Republicans, critical of Saudi conduct, tried and failed to force the Trump Administration to end its involvement.<br />Last week President Biden announced the U.S. would pull its assistance for “offensive operations” and cancel “relevant arms sales.” Mr. Biden paradoxically promised the U.S. still would help Saudi Arabia defend itself from Houthi attacks.<br />The State Department also appointed an envoy to begin a fresh push to end the conflict. Seeking a negotiated peace for a war that has killed nearly a quarter-million people is important.

Ms. Wolkoff had argued the confidentiality provisions ended when the White House terminated her job, and that the suit was an effort to silence her.<br />Her book, “Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship With the First Lady,” described Mrs. Trump as aloof and seemingly unbothered by the president’s behavior and policies.<br />The lawsuit garnered criticism, including within the Justice Department, where officials questioned whether the White House is inappropriately using the Justice Department to protect former President Donald Trump’s personal interests, current and former officials have said.  It was one of several actions the Trump Justice Department took last year involving damaging disclosures related to Mr. Trump.</td>

The organization is near to proposing a chapter 11 plan that would set up a compensation trust for men who were abused as children. Abuse victims are counting on insurance policies from decades ago, when most of the trauma took place, to fund a big chunk of the settlement program.<br />In court papers, the insurers question if many of the 95,000 sexual abuse claims filed against the Boy Scouts are legitimate and are seeking to interrogate a sampling of 1,400 men to determine whether their claims stand up to scrutiny.<br />That would require permission from the judge overseeing the chapter 11 case. An informal group of law firms calling itself the Coalition of Abused Scouts for Justice said in a Friday filing that the questioning would potentially retraumatize the men and that there were safeguards already in place to unearth phony claims. The discovery request “serves no legitimate purpose at this time other than for purposes of delay, harassment and intimidation,” the Coalition lawyers said on the behalf of the victims they represent.</td>

      <td>Democrats seek to divide Republicans and see little downside. That may turn out to be a miscalculation.</td>
      <td>What do Democrats hope to gain from Donald Trump’s impeachment trial? A conviction could prevent him from holding federal office again, but it isn’t clear they benefit from keeping him off the ballot. They beat him in 2020, and his looming presence could impede a new generation of Republican candidates.<br />But a trial will galvanize and unify the Democrats. It keeps the hated Mr. Trump in the spotlight and distracts from the central issue dividing Democrats: How progressive will President Biden’s agenda be? Even more important, they expect the trial to split the other party. Divide and conquer—pit pro- and anti-Trump Republicans against each other, not only now but for coming elections.<br />To recapture Congress next year and the White House in 2024, the GOP needs not only to retain Mr. Trump’s voters but to add to them. Republicans seen as anti-Trump fear losing contested primaries. In the general election, Trump supporters could lose swing voters. For the Democrats, by contrast, trying Mr. Trump seems a low-cost gesture. The only price, they believe, will be a brief delay in approving Mr. Biden’s nominees and momentary distraction from his agenda.<br />This isn’t to deny the bipartisan outrage over the assault on Capitol Hill, or the Democrats’ genuine belief (shared by many Republicans) that Mr. Trump’s actions after Nov. 3 breached the bounds of constitutional propriety. It is simply to recognize that Democrats and Republicans are political creatures who must make hard-nosed political calculations.<br />Yet the Democrats may end up paying a higher political price than they anticipate. The trial won’t only delay Mr. Biden’s program. It will tarnish his image as a “unifier” eager to work across party lines. That identity will be much harder to sustain after Democratic senators vote in lockstep to convict Mr. Trump and push through a mammoth Covid relief bill without any Republican votes.</td>

Amid a pandemic, a superpower contest with China, and a scourge of domestic extremism, policy makers could be forgiven for missing the days when Washington’s biggest worry in the world was an insurgency in Central Asia.<br />Yet as much as the White House might prefer to set aside Afghanistan, the conflict there cannot wait. Thanks to the flawed deal the Trump administration struck with the Taliban a year ago, the Biden team inherits a ticking time bomb it must quickly disarm.<br />Specifically, the Taliban agreement committed Washington to withdraw all its forces from Afghanistan by the end of April—less than 100 days from now. In exchange, the Taliban pledged not to allow terror groups to use Afghan territory to threaten the U.S. or its allies.<br />The U.S. has upheld its end of the bargain to the point that only 2,500 American troops remain in Afghanistan.<br />The Taliban, on the other hand, has made no sign of splitting with al Qaeda. The U.S. Treasury Department warned last month that al Qaeda influence in Afghanistan is actually increasing under Taliban protection. Taliban officials now speak of hosting al Qaeda members as “refugees”—the same rationale they used to shelter the group before 9/11.</td>

      <td>He rolls back a Trump reform to increase access to treatment.</td>
      <td>Among the Trump administration’s last and best decisions was to allow almost all physicians to prescribe buprenorphine, one of the most effective treatments for opioid addiction. Previously, only doctors who had completed an eight-hour training course and obtained a license from the Drug Enforcement Administration could do so. Only 7% of physicians are certified to prescribe the drug, and more than half of rural counties lacked a single prescriber as of 2018.<br />President Biden had promised during the campaign to abolish the licensing requirement, known as the “X-waiver,” which President Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services moved to nix a week before he left office. After France eliminated a similar regulation, the number of patients receiving buprenorphine increased tenfold, and opioid overdose deaths dropped by 80% in four years. Yet to the astonishment of the medical community, the Biden administration abruptly reversed the change on Jan. 27, arguing it didn’t pass legal muster and the White House budget office hadn’t signed off.<br />We hope this about-face wasn’t political. But if the only issue is procedural, why not let the change stand until Congress passes legislation to regularize it? There is every reason to do so: Nearly 130 Americans die of opioid overdoses on an average day, and a bipartisan bill has already been proposed, with plans for reintroduction.<br />The X-waiver stems from regulators’ concerns about using buprenorphine, an opioid, to treat opioid addiction. There is no similar requirement for prescribing opioids to treat pain. As physicians who prescribe buprenorphine, we can see why treating opioid addiction with an opioid might invite concern. But it makes sense. Buprenorphine’s chemical structure allows it to reduce cravings for other opioids like heroin while decreasing the risk of overdose should patients relapse on them. Just as impressive, it doesn’t cause the intense euphoria of other opioids, and it is usually formulated in combination with naloxone, a medication that blocks buprenorphine’s effects if injected, making misuse rare.<br />Given busy schedules, intimidation stemming from the unusual training requirement, and DEA scrutiny of buprenorphine prescribers, convincing physicians to obtain an X-waiver is a daunting task. Hospitals are so desperate for more prescribers that some are paying physicians nearly $750 to complete the X-waiver course. The federal government has also tried to improve buprenorphine access by extending prescribing rights to nurse practitioners and physician assistants who complete 24 hours of training and obtain an X-waiver. Still, the need for the treatment far outpaces supply.</td>

      <td>A distinguished author’s search for Grandpa, a rafﬁsh ‘supplier of nightlife’ to a Maﬁa-run backwater in central Pennsylvania.</td>
      <td>Do we really need another Mafioso-in-the-family memoir? I mean, seriously, we’ve had books that could be called Mafia Wife, Mafia Dad, Mafia Son, Mafia Stepdaughter, Mafia Uncle, Mafia Dachshund, Mafia Goldfish—okay, well, I made up a couple of those, but you get the point. When Al Capone’s purported grandson publishes a memoir, and he has, I think it’s safe to say we’ve reached saturation.<br />Which is why I was surprised how thoroughly I enjoyed Russell Shorto’s “Smalltime: A Story of My Family and the Mob.” Even more so once I realized a more accurate subtitle for the book would be “Searching for Grandpa: Second-in-Command of the Johnstown (Pa.) Mob.” In other words, this is not Mafia history that will send Geraldo Rivera scrambling to open a Shorto family safe anytime soon.<br />And that, oddly, is part of the book’s charm. The author of well-received histories of Amsterdam and New York City, Mr. Shorto has produced something that feels altogether fresh, a street-level portrait of how his late grandfather helped build what amounted to a Mafia small business—or businesses, actually, everything from the numbers and rigged card and dice games (Grandpa’s specialty) to pool halls, a cigar store, bars, bowling alleys and pinball arcades. There’s a murder mystery here—there has to be, right?—but make no mistake, this is a spry little book about small business.<br />As Mr. Shorto tells it, he had only the vaguest notion of his namesake grandfather Russell “Russ” Shorto’s career until an elderly cousin buttonholed him and urged him to write a book. Mr. Shorto is reluctant—“not my thing,” he avers—but soon finds himself in a Johnstown Panera Bread, surrounded by a gang of ancient, white-haired wise guys dying to tell him about the old days. Grandpa Russ, it seems, had a long run as a mid-level Mafia bureaucrat, running a sports book and crooked card games among other things, until his drinking got out of control and the law finally came calling.<br />For Mr. Shorto, the challenge is Grandpa Russ’s personality, or lack of one. He was a quiet man and, despite all the Panera chats, remains a cipher for much of the book. The story opens up once Mr. Shorto goes in search of the public Russ, tracing his family from its Sicilian roots and cataloging his newspaper clippings and arrest and FBI records. What emerges is the gritty tale of a talented card-and-dice cheat who gets his break in the late ’30s when a buttoned-down Mafioso named Joseph “Little Joe” Regino, who made his bones in Philadelphia, marries into Russ’s family and opens a Mafia franchise in Johnstown.</td>

      <td>Democrats are happy to throw over any rule, custom or convention that gets in their way.</td>
      <td>As the Senate convenes Tuesday to try Donald Trump for “inciting violence against the Government of the United States,” the big question isn’t whether he’s guilty. It’s whether the Senate has the right to try him at all.<br />Questions about the constitutional legitimacy of this impeachment are a good hint why the nation is moving further away from the healing and unity Joe Biden called for in his victory speech. Certainly the policies of the Biden administration will take the country in a new direction. But if divisions between Americans deepen, it will be less because of the policies themselves than the means used to ram them through.<br />Start with impeachment. Given the Constitution’s lack of clear-cut language on the issue, there are legitimate arguments for impeaching and trying a president who’s already left office. Surely, however, an honest debate would begin by at least conceding that one reason there are so many unresolved questions is that what we have in this case is so outside the norm.<br />It wasn’t until 1868, 79 years after George Washington’s first inaugural, that the nation had its first presidential impeachment, of Andrew Johnson. It took another 130 years until President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998. But in the space of 13 months, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has managed to impeach Mr. Trump twice, equaling all the previous presidential impeachments in U.S. history.<br />Both impeachments have been rushed affairs, the first launched by the speaker’s decree rather than a vote of the House. As Sen. Mitch McConnell complained that first time ’round, “the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is breaking critical precedents, denying the administration important rights that were afforded other presidents, and violating basic rules of due process.” This time is no better. The ranking member of the House Rules Committee, Rep. Tom Cole, points out that Democrats chose “to race to the floor with a new article of impeachment, forgoing any investigation, any committee process or any chance for members to fully contemplate this course of action before proceeding.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—House Democrats released the biggest piece of their coronavirus relief bill late Monday, offering a measure that would extend a $400-a-week unemployment insurance bonus through Aug. 29 and send $1,400 per-person payments to most households without lowering the income thresholds from earlier rounds.<br />Democrats have been debating whether to reduce those income levels, but the version headed for a Ways and Means Committee vote this week gives the full amounts to individuals with incomes up to $75,000 and married couples with incomes up to $150,000. The legislation also expands the child tax credit, broadens child-care assistance and bolsters tax credits for health insurance.<br />It will be combined with pieces advancing through other House committees with the aim of getting through the full House later this month. Together, the measures make up President Biden’s $1.9 trillion aid plan, which Democrats are trying to push quickly through Congress.<br />“Our nation is struggling, the virus is still not contained, and the American people are counting on Congress to meet this moment with bold, immediate action,” said Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.), the committee chairman whose panel will begin considering the bill on Wednesday.<br />Other sections of the relief plan will provide $130 billion in funding for K-12 schools, $40 billion for colleges and universities and $39 billion for child-care providers. Mr. Biden has also proposed offering funds for vaccine distribution, unemployment programs and state and local governments, among other measures.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Justice Department on Monday dropped its challenge of California’s net-neutrality law, in what may signal a shift back to an Obama-era policy aimed at equal access to the internet.<br />The Federal Communications Commission’s acting chairwoman applauded the Justice Department decision, which was conveyed through a one-sentence notice in federal district court in California that the case was being dismissed.<br />“By taking this step, Washington is listening to the American people, who overwhelmingly support an open internet, and is charting a course to once again make net neutrality the law of the land,” said Jessica Rosenworcel, who was designated as the FCC’s interim leader by President Biden.<br />Net-neutrality rules are aimed at preventing internet providers—mostly cable and phone companies—from favoring some internet content over others, for instance through higher speeds.<br />Reinstating the Obama-era rules has taken on added importance for some advocates since the Covid pandemic, because the regulations, which treated carriers like utilities, could help form the basis for addressing broadband affordability problems, for instance through eventual rate regulation of the service.</td>

Brewer III, the NRA’s main outside attorney, said in a statement: “Judge Journey purportedly supports the mission of the NRA and claims not to oppose the Association seeking to reincorporate in Texas. Unfortunately, he seems to mistakenly believe the NRA reorganization plan did not follow board and internal protocol. This plan was undertaken in full compliance with NRA policy.”</td>

Andrew Cuomo said Monday.<br />The moves came as both Mr. Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio expressed optimism for the months ahead, saying that arts and culture are key to the state’s reopening and return to normalcy.<br />Mr. Cuomo said testing would be crucial to reopening Broadway, noting the success of a recent Buffalo Bills game where 7,000 fans were tested beforehand for Covid-19 and allowed to watch in-person at Bills stadium.<br />“You can open a Broadway stage with a set percentage of occupants, where people have tested prior to walking in,” said Mr. Cuomo. “Would I go see a play and sit in a playhouse with 150 people? If the 150 people were tested, and all negative, yes, I would do that.”<br />The state’s new arts initiative is a baby step toward restarting live performances, with 300 free pop-up performances across the state that will begin on Feb. 20 and run through summer. The idea is to have lots of performances all over the state with small audiences, the governor’s office said.</td>

WHO officials and outside researchers said the trial was too small and its volunteers too young to draw clear conclusions about the vaccine’s efficacy against the variant, known as B.1.351, especially when it comes to preventing more severe cases of Covid-19. Younger people tend to suffer from milder versions of Covid-19 and experience severe cases less often.</td>

      <td>On his sophomore album, the British artist tries to reconcile his angry past with his hope for a more grounded future.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />The distinctive voice of British rapper Slowthai is simultaneously a squeak and a scream. It’s as if the 26-year-old MC, born Tyron Frampton, knows that making his vocal tone slightly annoying will also make it impossible to ignore. His moniker is unrelated to his ethnicity—Mr. Frampton grew up being called Ty in council estates in and around Northampton, England, and he spoke slowly; his roots are Irish, English and Barbadian. And he will never be mistaken for an American—his accent is thick, and some of his slang is incomprehensible to non-Brits. But if certain phrases are hard to make out and some images difficult to decode, the deeper meaning of his music is clear: It’s fueled by anger, while keeping open the possibility of redemption.<br />In 2019, when Slowthai released his debut LP, “Nothing Great About Britain,” that rage was directed at the political situation in the U.K., specifically the country’s pending exit from the European Union. He vented about income disparity and violent street life, but leavened his grimy tales with moments of optimism. He called his tour the “Brexit Bandit,” and in his homeland he became a star as his album was nominated for the Mercury Prize and hit the U.K. Top 10. But he remains a promising curiosity in the U.S., respected by his American peers and more dedicated fans of global hip-hop but obscure to the mainstream. His new record, “Tyron” (AWGE/Interscope/Method), comes out Friday and is unlikely to make a big commercial splash on these shores. But it’s an excellent collection of songs that builds on and broadens the sound of its predecessor while maintaining the artist’s essential identity.</td>

      <td>Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 could deliver raises for 27 million workers and lift 900,000 Americans above the poverty threshold—but the policy would cost 1.4 million Americans their jobs over the next four years, according to a study released by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office Monday.<br />President Biden and many Democrats are pursuing legislation to more than double the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour in phases, saying it would lift many low-wage workers out of poverty and deliver pay increases to many essential employees during the coronavirus pandemic, including workers at grocery stores, warehouses and in delivery vans. Republicans and some businesses and economists have warned that such an increase could cost jobs as the U.S. recovers from pandemic layoffs.<br />While the CBO study finds poverty-reducing effects, its broader findings could make it difficult for proponents of an increase to rally enough votes among moderate Democrats and Republicans in Congress to raise the federal minimum wage for the first time since 2009.<br />The study reaffirms a finding that a $15 minimum wage could cost the U.S. jobs, slightly increasing a job-loss estimate from a widely cited 2019 CBO study. While many Americas would see raises, the analysis showed a minimum-wage increase would cause prices to rise, the federal budget deficit to widen and overall economic output to slightly decrease over the next decade.<br />Whether to include the minimum-wage increase in the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package has divided Democrats, who can’t afford to lose a single vote in the evenly split Senate. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) has publicly said he is opposed to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, while progressive lawmakers have pushed for the increase.</td>

      <td>Elon Musk’s bitcoin purchase for Tesla is another warning for investors in the wake of GameStop mania</td>
      <td>GameStop  mania was a wake-up call, but now the capital markets have truly reached ludicrous mode.<br />Electric-car maker  Tesla  said in a securities filing Monday that it has purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and that it expects to begin accepting payment in the cryptocurrency for its products in the future. Tesla shares and bitcoin both traded higher after the announcement. This follows social media posts by the auto maker’s influential boss, Elon Musk, that already had helped drive bitcoin’s price to a record. All told, the rally spurred by the announcement on Monday added more than $100 billion to bitcoin’s market value, while Tesla shares also rose yet again.<br />The investment is more than symbolic for the company, being equivalent to Tesla’s research-and-development tab for 2020. And while uniting two of the most popular investment themes under one roof is undoubtedly a winner today, the decision introduces even more risk to owning what is already one of the most speculative stocks of the current bull market.<br />As Tesla itself said in the filing, prices for digital assets such as bitcoin have been volatile in the past. Cryptocurrencies are a fairly recent development and their long-term adoption by consumers, investors and businesses is highly uncertain. That adds to the speculative fervor already gripping Tesla’s stock price in a feedback loop. Indeed, the manager of the most popular active fund recently, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest, has made big bets on both Tesla and a trust that owns bitcoin, fueling a record pace of inflows.<br />At a market value of about $800 billion, Tesla trades at about 6.5 times the combined value of  Ford  and  General Motors ,  despite controlling a small fraction of the global auto market. And Tesla lately has been losing market share in Western Europe to competitors including  Volkswagen ,  which has begun to compete aggressively in the electric category. The news of Tesla’s bitcoin investment eclipsed a negative headline for the company Monday about quality issues identified in the important Chinese market.</td>

      <td>An HBO documentary explores the oft-forgotten history of Black artists—from movements of the past half-century to today’s luminaries, including Kara Walker, Kehinde Wiley and Jordan Casteel—often in their own words.</td>
      <td><br /><br />‘All painting is about light; the obsession with light is at once visual, religious and erotic.” So says Kehinde Wiley in HBO’s new documentary “Black Art: In the Absence of Light” (Tuesday, 9 p.m.), an illuminating bird’s-eye view of the past half-century of Black art in America. Luminosity is central to Mr. Wiley’s work—best known is his radical presidential portrait of Barack Obama—and to the attitudes of so many of the personalities on camera here, shining as they do with the glow of creativity, the bright assurance in their hard-won talents, and the fiery admiration for those who came before them.<br />Those forebears are an unflagging presence throughout the film, directed by Sam Pollard, both onscreen and off. Painter Kerry James Marshall explains how Betye Saar’s “Black Girl’s Window” (1969) inspired his surprisingly diverse palette that deploys a range of blacks—turning the old adage on its head, he explains his view that “black is not the absence of color, black is particular kinds of color”—and we hear from Ms. Saar as she reminisces about teaching him. Theaster Gates, now best known as an installation and conceptual artist, started his career as a ceramist, and he talks passionately about discovering the work of Dave Drake at a point when he  knew only white potters. Drake, long dead, makes no appearance here, but his works do: stoneware vessels created by an enslaved man working in South Carolina, works simultaneously utilitarian and beautiful, and all the more captivating thanks to the inscriptions he added, etched into their surfaces at a time when literacy was uncommon—if not outright illegal—for men in his position.<br />So while the past can be a site of celebration, it is equally a locus of ignorance, exclusion and worse. The documentary takes as its inspiration and starting point the seminal 1976 exhibition “Two Centuries of Black American Art,” one of the events planned to commemorate the nation’s bicentennial. Organized by artist and curator David Driskell, that show—which opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and traveled to Atlanta’s High Museum of Art, the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts and the Brooklyn Museum—was meant as a corrective to the widespread underrepresentation of Black artists in art historical contexts. Included were 1800s portraiture by Joshua Johnson, landscapes in the Hudson River School tradition by Robert S. Duncanson, and Tonalist works by Edward Bannister. “Two Centuries,” which also presented such modern practitioners as Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, Charles White and Alma Thomas, announced proudly that Black art was American art, even if major museums weren’t reflecting that fact.</td>

      <td>David Correia ordered detained after pleading guilty to lying to federal election officials and duping investors</td>
      <td>A federal judge on Monday sentenced a Florida businessman to a year and a day in prison for lying to federal election authorities and for duping investors in a fraud-insurance company after convictions that stemmed from a sweeping investigation that ensnared several associates of Rudy Giuliani.<br />David Correia pleaded guilty last fall to one count of making false statements to the Federal Election Commission about the source of a $325,000 donation to a pro-Trump super PAC and to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with the fraud-insurance company, Fraud Guarantee.<br />Mr. Correia, 45 years old, admitted to working with Mr. Giuliani’s associate, Lev Parnas, to convince investors—often using exaggerations and misstatements about the company’s worth—to put more than $2.3 million into Fraud Guarantee. The company never got off the ground, and Messrs. Parnas and Correia used much of the funds to pay for personal expenses, prosecutors said.<br />Mr. Parnas has pleaded not guilty. His trial was set for early this year but has been postponed. A lawyer for Mr. Parnas didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />Messrs. Correia and Parnas were arrested on campaign-finance charges in October 2019, and the investigation expanded to include scrutiny of Mr. Giuliani’s business affairs and his efforts—often with Mr. Parnas at his side—to push for investigations in Ukraine that could benefit former President Donald Trump. Those efforts helped lead to Mr. Trump’s first impeachment; he was acquitted by the Senate.</td>

      <td>The federal budget deficit was $348 billion in the same period last year</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. federal budget deficit widened sharply last month, the Congressional Budget Office said, as the latest coronavirus-relief package from Congress sent direct stimulus payments to millions of Americans.<br />The monthly deficit widened to an estimated $165 billion in January, compared with $33 billion in January 2020 and $144 billion in December, the nonpartisan CBO estimated on Monday.<br />For the first four months of the 2021 fiscal year—which started Oct. 1—the federal budget deficit rose 90% to $738 billion, the CBO added.<br />Federal spending surged in January as elements of the $900 billion aid package signed into law at the end of 2020 began taking effect. Among the costliest provisions was $142 billion in stimulus checks paid out in January and $25 billion in rental-assistance grants to state and local governments.<br />Spending on unemployment benefits, which received a top-up in the legislation, rose to $34 billion last month from $28 billion in December and $3 billion in January 2020, before the pandemic struck the U.S. economy.</td>

      <td>The saxophonist and pianist collaborate on an album featuring new duet versions of standards by John Coltrane, Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk.</td>
      <td><br />Saxophonist Archie Shepp and pianist Jason Moran are both jazz titans: Mr. Shepp, age 83, is an NEA Jazz Master and was an important protégé of John Coltrane; Mr. Moran, 46, is a MacArthur Fellow and artistic director for jazz at the Kennedy Center. The two men met backstage at a Belgian jazz festival in 2015 and, despite the nearly four-decade difference in their ages, a musical relationship began. They played together whenever the opportunity allowed, and a common interest emerged—recasting the blues within the classic jazz and gospel repertoires. “Let My People Go” (Archieball, out now), a collection of duets, is their first progress report.<br />The music was recorded at two concert halls—in Paris in 2017 and in Mannheim, Germany, the following year—but much of it has a gritty, unvarnished quality, as if played in an out-of-the-way roadhouse. And the intimate duet format feels very of the moment, the Covid-19 pandemic having put a hold on many midsize and large ensemble recordings and having led to an abundance of solo, duo and trio performances.<br />Before their collaboration, Messrs. Shepp and Moran were on convergent paths; each had moved beyond jazz to establish a voice in other genres and disciplines. Mr. Shepp remains best known as a firebrand whose work, both as a leader and with the New York Contemporary 5, was a cornerstone of the ’60s avant garde, but he also recorded three remarkable duet settings in the late ’70s and ’80s with pianist Horace Parlan that focused on similar repertoire to that heard in “Let My People Go.” Those albums helped rebrand Mr. Shepp as a savvy veteran. Age has not robbed the saxophonist of his ambition. Last year he released “Ocean Bridges” (Redefinition), a collaboration with his rapper nephew Raw Poetic and the multi-instrumentalist Damu the Fudgemunk that found common ground between jazz, hip-hop and new millennium funk.<br />Since winning his MacArthur in 2010, Mr. Moran has been exceptionally active both in jazz and in the visual art world. His artistic activities, which range from paintings and drawings to installations that focus on the spaces in which music is heard, have landed him a solo exhibit at the Whitney Museum in 2019 and shows at many other internationally known venues. All of his recent recordings have been in solos, duos or trios, and when not working as a leader he has collaborated with elders like bassist Dave Holland and saxophonist Charles Lloyd in small configurations. The pandemic seems to have done little to slow Mr. Moran down. In addition to “Let My People Go,” he recently released a solo disc, “The Sound Will Tell You” (Bandcamp). Made in conjunction with his show of the same name at New York’s Luhring Augustine gallery, which runs through Feb. 27, it was recorded in the first week of January and released on the 15th of that month. His larger, multidisciplinary production “Two Wings: The Music of Black America in Migration,” with his wife Alicia Hall Moran, toured major concert halls across the country in 2019 and is slated for performances this summer.</td>

      <td>Texas Republican, aged 67, was just beginning second term</td>
      <td>Rep. Ron Wright (R., Texas) died Sunday after contracting Covid-19, according to his campaign office, becoming the first member of Congress to die from the coronavirus while in office.<br />Mr. Wright’s death at the age of 67 came two weeks after he was admitted to Baylor Hospital in Dallas, his campaign said. He said on Jan. 21 that he had tested positive for Covid-19 after coming into contact with someone who was infected. He was also being treated for cancer, his office said.<br />“Despite years of painful, sometimes debilitating treatment for cancer, Ron never lacked the desire to get up and go to work, to motivate those around him, or to offer fatherly advice,” his campaign said Monday.<br />Mr. Wright was starting his second term in Congress. He previously served as a member of the Arlington, Texas, City Council and as chief of staff for former Rep. Joe Barton, a fellow Texas Republican who previously represented the district, south of Dallas.<br />Mr. Wright hadn’t received the Covid-19 vaccine, his spokesman said. It wasn’t immediately known why the lawmaker hadn’t been vaccinated.</td>

      <td>The Covid pandemic has both made it harder to meet a partner and provided time for introspection, fueling some new decisions among single women in their 30s and 40s</td>
      <td>Kelli Wheeler always knew she wanted to have children. But in April, her boyfriend broke up with her right as the pandemic set off social-distancing mandates that make dating much more complicated. The 34-year-old decided she would have to rethink her path to motherhood.<br />“Even if I met a guy quite quickly, I was three or four years away from having kids because I’d want some time where it was just the two of us,” says Ms. Wheeler, a digital-content producer in Los Angeles. “I began looking into ways I could take control of my fertility, without a man.” She booked a consultation at a fertility clinic and plans to freeze her eggs this spring.<br />Ms. Wheeler is one of many single women in their 30s and 40s who have found themselves reassessing their plans for having children in the past year. The pandemic has both made it harder to meet a partner and provided time for introspection. For some women, that has sparked a realization that they want to prioritize motherhood, regardless of whether they are in a relationship. Plenty of men, of course, have had similar epiphanies, but biology forces women to take action within a more limited window of time.<br />“For a single person who thought they wanted to have children within an established relationship, Covid has put a year-long hold on their ability to meet someone,” says Laura Lindberg, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization. “That may lead to some difficult decision making.”<br />In a June report from Guttmacher, more than 40 percent of women surveyed said the pandemic had changed their plans about when to have children and how many they wanted to have. The survey looked at women overall, not single women specifically. Thirty-four percent of women said they were putting motherhood on hold or planning to have fewer children because of the disruption caused by the virus.</td>
