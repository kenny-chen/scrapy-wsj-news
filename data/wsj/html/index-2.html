That beat the consensus estimates of analysts polled by FactSet, who predicted per-share earnings of $1.30 on revenue of $11.58 billion.<br />Morgan Stanley rounded out fourth-quarter earnings reports from the nation’s big banks, which continued to benefit from a recovery on Wall Street and federal pandemic-response measures that forestalled the worst-case economic scenario. On Tuesday, rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported a fourth-quarter profit that was more than twice as large as year-earlier results and annual revenue that was at an 11-year high.<br />With its focus on wealthy Americans and big corporations and money managers, Morgan Stanley is less exposed to mass unemployment and small-business closures than more Main Street banks.<br />Stock- and bond-trading revenue at Morgan Stanley rose 32% to $4.22 billion. Fees from advising on deals and underwriting stock and bond offerings increased 46% to $2.30 billion.</td>

      <td>Banks have outsize exposure to small businesses, the backbone of the continent’s economy. If these businesses fail, pain awaits Europe’s already-stretched lenders.</td>
      <td>Miguel Ríos had a bustling business running four karaoke bars in Barcelona until the coronavirus forced him to shut them. He took out bank loans worth €80,000, equivalent to $96,000, put his 10 employees on a government wage-support program and hoped for the best.<br />Almost a year later, with doors still closed, Mr. Ríos worries his business will fold, leaving him with a pile of debt and exposing his banks to losses. “We are resisting thanks to savings and bank loans, but we can’t keep like this much longer,” the 59-year-old entrepreneur said.<br />His story is echoed across Europe as small businesses fight to stay afloat through the pandemic. Their survival is key for the region’s banks, which together have over €2 trillion on loan to them—40% of the lenders’ entire business loan books.<br />Overall, lenders have considerably cleaned up bad loans from the previous crisis, but many are still stuck with souring portfolios. They are also struggling to make money in a negative-rates environment.<br />Regulators fear a new—and potentially bigger—wave of defaults could send banks scrambling to cover losses. Weaker ones could require state help to survive. Andrea Enria, the head of banking supervision at the European Central Bank, has warned that bad loans in the eurozone could soar to as high as €1.4 trillion—more than during the aftermath of the financial crisis—if the economy contracts more than expected.</td>

      <td>Burberry’s turnaround plans are seen as less convincing than a similar push at Prada</td>
      <td>Investors don’t want to miss out on the luxury sector’s next Gucci-style brand turnaround. Still, their strong preference for  Prada  SpA over  Burberry  Group, both of which are in the middle of revamps, is a puzzle.<br />On Wednesday, Burberry said comparable retail sales fell 9% in its most recent quarter compared with the prior-year period. Even though the numbers were weaker than analysts expected, there are also early signs that the company’s efforts to shift more stock at full price are beginning to pay off. If the British trench-coat brand can reduce the number of products it has to sell at a discount, profit margins should improve.<br />Burberry stock rose slightly in European morning trading, but it still has a long way to go to catch up with Prada. The Milanese label is the best-performing large luxury stock of the past 12 months, gaining 67%, while Burberry is one of the worst. Prada’s shares have traditionally been more expensive than its British peer’s, but the premium has skyrocketed in recent months.<br />There isn’t much hard evidence yet to justify investors’ faith in Prada. Earlier this month, the company said its retail sales fell 6% in the second half of 2020—better than Burberry’s latest numbers, but not by much. True, there are some indications that Prada is getting more attention on social media. It ranked fourth in a recent Citi Brand Heat Tracker, while Burberry languished in 14th place. The question is whether this will translate into meaningful market-share gains as more consumers emerge from lockdowns this year.<br />Investors may favor Prada because its operating margins have been high in the past, peaking at 27% almost a decade ago. The business hasn’t been that lucrative in years, but as the Italian label makes a bigger cut of sales from highly profitable handbags, shareholders may be betting it can return to those highs. Burberry, by contrast, has a heritage in clothing, where margins are lower. Takeover speculation could also explain excitement about Prada, although its controlling shareholder has said the brand isn’t for sale.</td>

      <td>Can we face a bear market even if the economy booms? Yes, but it would be rare.</td>
      <td>We keep being reminded that the stock market isn’t the economy. But then, is it possible for the market to go into a long bear run even if the economy booms? Yes, although there is little record of it ever happening.<br />U.S. stocks’ performance over the past year has been more than breathtaking. Even though the U.S. economy is in decidedly worse shape than it was before the Covid-19 crisis started, with millions of Americans still out of work, stocks quickly rebounded from their spring selloff and surged to new highs. Valuations have touched levels seen only in the years surrounding the dot-com bubble and in the run-up to the 1929 crash.<br />It is an apt example of how the stock market’s link to the economy can be as thin as tissue paper. Even the idea that stocks are pricing in an expected boom in the economy once the pandemic passes is looking pretty flimsy as stocks don’t just look rich versus analysts’ expected 2021 earnings but versus expected earnings in 2022.<br />If stocks can be so divorced from the economy as it struggles through the coronavirus crisis, they also can be detached from it when the pandemic lessens its grip. With another round of fiscal support looking likely, and vaccinations under way, economists have been marking up their economic growth forecasts for this year. There is no rule that says that should send stocks higher, though.<br />To some extent stocks might have done well not just despite the pandemic, but because of it. The big companies represented in the major stock indexes were, in large part, less affected than many small businesses. Goods sectors such as manufacturing, which are a bigger part of the market than of the economy as a whole, have fared better than services. So it might be businesses underrepresented in the stock market that are the bigger beneficiaries of a better economy this year.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—International tennis stars jetted into Australia last week from some of the world’s worst coronavirus hot spots. At the same time, ordinary Australians were prohibited from traveling between the country’s two biggest cities because of a small outbreak in one of them.<br />Australia’s tough border controls have been credited with helping the country to contain the coronavirus. Now, Australia’s decision to let hundreds of tennis players into the country ahead of the Australian Open, one of the biggest tennis tournaments in the world, is serving up a public debate on whether some people are getting preferential treatment.<br />“It feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth,” said Julie Land, 42 years old, who has been trying to return to Australia from the U.S. with her family and will have to wait until at least March for an available flight. “Cricket players, tennis entourages and celebrities seem to have no issues at all accessing Australia.”<br />How Australia balances the needs of athletes with anger from some members of the public could offer lessons for other global sports tournaments due to be held this year. Japan, another country with a low number of coronavirus cases by international standards, is scheduled to host the Olympics in July, after they were postponed last year.<br />The tournament is an economic driver for Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city. Last year, more than 800,000 people attended, and organizers estimated that about $300 million was injected into the local economy. Broadcasts of the tournament reached more than 900 million homes globally.</td>

Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast revenue of $64.96 billion.<br />UnitedHealth’s revenue from premiums grew to $50.58 billion, from $47.63 billion a year earlier. The company also logged higher revenue from products, services and investment income than it did in the year-ago quarter.<br />As more people returned to medical providers for care that they had avoided or postponed earlier in the pandemic, UnitedHealth’s costs rose as well. Medical costs climbed to $42.08 billion, up from $39.28 billion in the year-ago period. Operating costs increased to $11.51 billion, from $9.3 billion in the previous year’s fourth quarter.</td>

      <td>A Democratic majority in both chambers of Congress, even with narrow margins, could open the door to some potentially transformative clean-energy policies</td>
      <td>The narrow Democratic Party majority in Congress might close the door on some of President-elect Joe Biden’s most ambitious clean-energy proposals, but it opens one up for tax-policy changes. That alone could supercharge the industry.<br />Tax and spending measures can pass through a simple majority in the Senate through a budget-reconciliation process, which is why many industry watchers are focused on it. Notably, there are tax provisions that passed the Democrat-controlled House in July but never made it onto the Senate’s agenda when it was Republican-controlled.<br />One such measure worth watching includes an investment tax credit for energy storage. Keith Martin, a partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, notes that the provision is well-developed and has momentum behind it. Today, energy storage qualifies for the tax credits only if it is paired with solar energy, and there are finicky rules to prove eligibility. Such rules have meant battery systems that exist solely for grid services, for example, were shut out entirely.<br />An investment tax credit for energy storage has been on the clean-energy industry’s wish list for years and is a potential game-changer. The lack of cheap storage remains one of the key bottlenecks to a grid that relies primarily on intermittent solar and wind energy. Though battery technologies have become cheaper over the years, tax credits would increase its competitiveness. A tax credit for stand-alone energy storage could translate to 16% growth in the U.S. energy-storage market, according to a Wood Mackenzie report from 2019. The Solar Energy Industry Association credits the same subsidy for allowing the solar industry to grow by more than 10,000% since it was enacted in 2006.<br />Another potential measure is a longer extension of existing renewable tax credits. While a stimulus bill passed in late December included one-year and two-year extensions for tax credits commonly used by onshore wind- and solar-power plants, respectively, the House infrastructure bill passed last year included a five-year extension for both. A further extension could be a relatively easy win given that renewable tax credits have a history of receiving bipartisan support. Experience has shown that longer visibility on tax credits allows the industry to grow without sudden stops.</td>

And P&G, armed with extra cash following years of downsizing and solid sales, has been churning out a range of high-end items including laundry-detergent pods designed for extra-large washing machines and a special line of Gillette shaving products. The shift comes as consumers stuck at home because of the coronavirus pandemic broadly are spending more to keep their homes and themselves clean.<br />The Cincinnati company’s organic sales increased 8% to $19.75 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. P&G raised its estimates for full-year organic sales growth to between 5% and 6%, up from the previous range of 4% to 5%.<br />“Consumers are driven to products where they can say, ‘I know that will deliver for me and my family,’ ” P&G operating chief Jon Moeller said in an interview.<br />The strongest growth was in P&G’s fabric and home-care unit, which posted a 12% sales gain. The unit’s brands include Tide, Mr. Clean, Dawn dish soap and Cascade dishwasher detergent. Sales in P&G’s grooming unit, which includes Gillette razors, rose 5%.

      <td>Spectrum auction will cost carriers about $95 billion, but payoff is uncertain</td>
      <td>Wireless carriers clearly believe their own press about 5G. And they are wagering a huge sum to prove it.<br />The latest auction of wireless spectrum licenses by the Federal Communications Commission ended on Friday with a total of $80.9 billion. Adding in an estimated $13 billion to $14 billion in clearing costs to help move satellite operators to new frequencies will bring the total bill for this latest auction to around $95 billion—roughly triple what many analysts had projected. All for the purpose of securing the necessary capacity for the latest standard of wireless networking known as 5G.<br />Much remains undisclosed at the moment, including how much each carrier bid for what slices of spectrum. But analysts agree that  AT&T  and  Verizon  likely paid the most—because they needed the most. A trio of brokers who published estimates on Tuesday averaged a guess of $22 billion in total final bids from AT&T and $42 billion from Verizon, including the clearing costs.  T-Mobile ,  which already has a strong 5G spectrum position thanks to last year’s merger with Sprint, is estimated to have spent around $10 billion. Full results from the auction aren’t expected to be public until sometime next month.<br />Winning the licenses is one thing; paying for them is another. AT&T currently has the fifth-highest dividend yield on the S&P 500, according to FactSet. It also has a pressing need to invest in its Hollywood operations that include the HBO Max streaming service. Doug Mitchelson of  Credit Suisse  wrote Tuesday that AT&T may need to find incremental asset sales to offset its spectrum bill, lest the carrier’s credit rating get downgraded to something close to junk status. Verizon isn’t under the same kind of pressure, but Mr. Mitchelson predicted that stock buybacks at Verizon are “now off the table for years.”<br />There also is the question of making 5G pay off. So far, the performance of those services hasn’t lived up to years of hype from carriers. A survey by UBS in October found that 5G ranked “among low priorities” of smartphone users—below that of battery life and other functions. Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson notes that 5G revenue forecasts aren’t going up just because the spectrum costs came in much higher than expected. Those carriers also will still need to invest the necessary capital expenditures to make use of the spectrum. “Winning” the government’s recent auction may turn into more of a Pyrrhic victory.</td>

      <td>Markets where vaccines are rolled out rapidly may be beneficiaries, but the greater impact could be on the laggards</td>
      <td>The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is finally under way. Markets are already showing that the speed of local rollouts matters quite a bit—but global vaccination campaigns will also ripple through financial markets in some unexpected ways, including in places that have successfully controlled the disease.<br />It is difficult to pin down the precise impact of vaccine deployment so far. In the past month, while the MSCI All Country World Index is up by 3.3%, benchmark equity indexes in Israel and Dubai, two places with among the fastest vaccine rollouts globally, are up by around 8% apiece. Clearly vaccines aren’t everything though: The Bahrain All Share Index is down a little more than 2% over the same period, despite a rapid rollout.<br />Markets where vaccines are rolled out rapidly may be beneficiaries, but the greater impact may be on the laggards. Hospitality, travel and bank stocks are key areas on which to concentrate.<br />The MSCI World Banks Index has clearly been a major beneficiary of vaccine-related good news this winter: The index’s gain since the beginning of 2020 still lags behind the broad MSCI World by 22 percentage points. But it has clawed back more than a third of the 35 percentage-point gap that existed in mid-October.<br />As deployment continues, the difficult question of whether some vaccines are more effective than others also will come to the fore. Late-stage trial data from Brazil suggest that the Sinovac vaccine, CoronaVac, met the World Health Organization’s benchmark for widespread use by a whisker, with an efficacy rate of 50.4%.</td>

They are now closing in on the same decision-making window for 2021, with last year’s problems still in play and a few new ones that have surfaced as the pandemic has continued.<br />Vaccinations—for the hosts, athletes and spectators—are a big topic.<br />Although Olympic organizers have said they won’t require vaccines for fans and athletes coming to the Games, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has said he wants almost everyone in Japan vaccinated by the Olympics’ July 23 start. Japan has secured enough vaccines to inoculate all of its population, though none has yet received local regulatory approval and the country hasn’t started vaccinations.</td>

Now, the U.K. hopes it is turning the tide, thanks to a homegrown vaccine that has yet to be authorized elsewhere in the West.<br />More than four million of the most at-risk people in the U.K., almost 8% of the adult population, have been vaccinated with at least one shot of vaccine.<br />Among them are more than half of the frailest group of all: the 300,000 elderly residents of nursing homes who can’t travel to get a shot. The key to reaching them has been mobile vaccination teams armed with a shot developed by the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC.<br />Together with a network of family doctors and vaccination hubs in sports centers, hotels and cathedrals, this shot has helped the country to stay on track toward a target of vaccinating its 15 million most vulnerable people by mid-February.<br />The government says the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has also been authorized in India, Morocco and some countries in Latin America, has been a game changer in reaching people tucked away in smaller nursing homes.</td>

      <td>The action comes under the Deferred Enforced Departure program that offers deportation protections and work permits to immigrants in the country without authorization</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—As one of his final acts in office, President Trump has authorized a program to give work permits and deportation protections to Venezuelan immigrants in the U.S. without legal permission, an action President-elect Joe Biden had promised to take during the 2020 campaign.<br />The designation formally known as Deferred Enforced Departure offers legal protections to any Venezuelan national present in the U.S. as of Jan. 20, 2021, for 18 months. That is likely to benefit at least 94,000 Venezuelans in the country without authorization as of 2018, according to the Migration Policy Institute, though analysts believe the current number is likely higher.<br />Mr. Trump’s move is seen as a form of pressure the U.S. government can use against Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan authoritarian leader whom the Trump administration has targeted with sanctions, a limited travel ban and other measures. In Jan. 2019, the U.S. officially recognized the country’s opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as Venezuela’s interim president.<br />During the 2020 campaign, Mr. Biden said he would offer Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelan immigrants should he win the election, addressing a major ask of the Venezuelan-American community in Florida that he was courting. TPS is roughly identical to the Deferred Enforced Departure program in the protections it offers. DED is issued directly by a president, while TPS must be approved by the Homeland Security secretary.<br />Republicans and Democrats in Florida have been lobbying for the move—south Florida is home to one of the largest Venezuelan populations in the U.S.—and the White House has long waffled over whether to take the step.</td>

But in a briefing for reporters, they clarified earlier updates by revealing that the testing setback resulted from the combination of a malfunctioning sensor and how Saturday’s test was set up rather than design or production defects with the engines themselves.<br />Outgoing National Aeronautics and Space Administration chief Jim Bridenstine and some top aides emphasized that on top of probable schedule delays, extra testing could stress parts of the 212-foot rocket to the point that performing its mission could be problematic.<br />The agency didn’t give a timeline for a decision, though some of its internal safety guidelines suggest that typically a new test would be necessary to demonstrate reliability of the booster’s primary propulsion system.<br />The looming trade-offs over testing present engineering and political challenges for NASA as well as Boeing, even as new appointees in a Biden administration are expected to reassess the status of the troubled multibillion-dollar SLS program.</td>

I’m glad to hear it. My focus has been and will continue to be working for the people of North Carolina during this difficult time for our nation.”<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation began looking into reports in March that several members of Congress, their spouses or their investment advisers sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock after lawmakers attended closed-door briefings about the threat posed by the virus as it was beginning to reach the U.S. Some of those trades spared lawmakers as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses as stocks sank by mid-March.<br />Mr. Burr, who sat on two committees that received detailed briefings on the growing pandemic, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, which he had chaired, had sold shares of companies valued at as much as $1.7 million, which he owned with his wife. The sale saved the couple at least $250,000 in losses based on what those stocks were worth at the close of trading March 19, the Journal reported at the time.<br />Mr. Burr had said he made the trades based on news reports out of Asia rather than any inside information he had received, but he stepped down from his post as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee while the investigation continued.</td>

It also reflected Mr. Pai’s skill for navigating politically perilous rules for cellular networks, television broadcasters and big media mergers—topics about which the president often opined.<br />“It’s very important for the FCC chair to maintain its independence because otherwise, instead of putting your finger on the problem, you’re putting your finger in the wind,” Mr. Pai said Tuesday. “That’s not a good place to be for any independent leader.”<br />Mr. Pai, a Republican who spent years as a commissioner before becoming the first Indian American to lead the telecom regulator, will leave office Wednesday before the inauguration of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden. The departing official oversaw a collection of networks that grew bigger, faster and more varied over the past four years.<br />The telecom-industry veteran took the top job in 2017 with a promise to cut red tape holding back network investments. He started by rewriting his predecessor’s rules governing internet privacy and net neutrality, a concept that encourages broadband providers to carry all lawful internet data alike. Many changes dismayed Democrats but withstood repeated court challenges, fulfilling the Republican official’s pledge to make regulations more predictable.</td>

One-third of small businesses surveyed between Jan. 4 and Jan. 10 said they would need financial assistance or additional capital in the next six months, according to the Census Bureau, up from nearly 25% in mid-November.<br />“It’s encouraging to see that kind of volume go out the door, especially knowing that it can only go up from here,” said John Lettieri, chief executive of the nonprofit Economic Innovation Group. But small businesses have waited for a long time for that lifeline and some that could have been salvaged have failed, he said.<br />The average PPP loan size was below $20,000 for first-time borrowers and below $75,000 for second-time borrowers for applications processed through Jan. 17, according to an SBA spokesman, a sign the loans were being approved for smaller businesses. Loan amounts are based on the size of an applicant’s payroll.</td>

      <td>Streaming giant tempers subscriber outlook with surprising cash flow projection</td>
      <td>All its years in Hollywood have clearly taught  Netflix  the value of tweaking the screenplay.<br />Wall Street’s script for Netflix has been simple to date: a singular focus on user numbers. And the streaming giant has clearly delivered on that recently, thanks in part to the pandemic that confined people to their homes. The company said Tuesday that it added a record 36.5 million paid subscribers in 2020, with fourth-quarter additions of 8.5 million subscribers beating its own projection by 42%. Over the previous five years, Netflix had averaged about 22.5 million paid subscriber additions annually.<br />But the unique circumstances of Netflix’s recent pace mean it is very unlikely to continue. Indeed, Netflix projected only 6 million subscriber additions for the first quarter, matching the low end of Wall Street’s forecasts. But the company offset the disappointment with the target of breaking even on a free-cash-flow basis this year, compared with its earlier projection of burning as much as $1 billion. The company even bolded a claim in its quarterly letter to shareholders that it believes it will no longer need to raise external financing for its day-to-day operations. Its shares were up more than 13% following the report.<br />The reaction suggests Netflix and its investors are ready to grow up a bit. The company has burned cash since 2013 in a race to build up exclusive content on the correct assumption that studios that produced top-flight programming would eventually create their own streaming outlets. That has played out vividly over the past 18 months with the launch of services such as Disney+, HBO Max and Peacock. New rivals also have cost Netflix access to popular comfort-viewing programs such as “Friends” and “The Office.”<br />Fortunately, Netflix now has plenty of popular shows of its own. Moreover, the company’s tenure in streaming gives it unique insight into what audiences actually want to see. Who else would have given the green light to a hit show with washed-up “Karate Kid” characters?</td>

      <td>By his own instincts, or the desires of his party’s progressives?</td>
      <td>Joe Biden begins his Presidency at a moment of deep political division, but paradoxically this gives him a rare opportunity. No doubt his Inaugural Address will echo his campaign theme of unity and healing, but his success in that mission will depend on resisting the divisive progressive domination sought by his party’s left.<br />Mr. Biden has been around long enough to appreciate the good fortune that has brought him to the Oval Office. Covid-19 accentuated Donald Trump’s leadership flaws and ruined the strong pre-pandemic economy. Mr. Biden was going nowhere in the Democratic primaries until Bernie Sanders emerged as the front-runner and the party turned to the former Vice President in political desperation.<br />Now as he takes office, the vaccines are rolling out and the economy is ready to soar once the Covid scourge eases. He will get political credit for the rebound simply by being there as the pandemic pall lifts. Unlike a Republican, Mr. Biden will also have nearly all of the media and the commanding heights of American culture behind him. A majority of Americans want an end to the furious rancor of recent years, and Mr. Biden is poised to benefit.<br />Left to his own political instincts, Mr. Biden could be the man for this moment. He is a moderate liberal with sympathy for the working class who is inclined to reach across the political aisle. With a 50-50 Senate and a narrow House majority, he also has good practical reason to do so. At 78 years old, he realizes he is likely to serve only one term and could create an admirable legacy as the man who calmed the Trump-era furies. That, at least, is our hopeful case for the Biden years.<br />Yet Mr. Biden also comes to power with a Democratic Party whose ascendant progressives have other ideas. Their goal is to use the federal government as a battering ram to drive economic and cultural “transformation.” Progressives in the House and Senate, urged on by the Democratic media complex and Silicon Valley, view the defeat of Donald Trump as the opening to assert a new level of government control over the economy and cultural dominance over American society.</td>

      <td>Have the social-media platforms gone too far or acted too late? Students debate.</td>
      <td>Editor’s note: This week’s Future View discusses censorship on social media. For next week, we’ll ask students to make the case for one policy change that Joe Biden should prioritize in his first 100 days in office. Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Jan. 26. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Tell the Truth<br />There are three dominant narratives on the social-media censorship. The first is that social-media companies are private enterprises and should be able to censor speech as they deem fit. The second is that social media has become so vital to the exercise of speech that it has become part of the public square. And just as a town clerk isn’t allowed to deny a permit to a demonstration because he finds its subject matter objectionable, so too social-media companies must be constrained from censoring speech. The third also begins with the premise that social media has become highly influential, but concludes that platforms have a duty to stamp out whatever they (frequently progressives) find unsavory. That town clerk should take a stand and deny the permit.<br />I’d emphasize the private nature of social-media companies, and add that they should be held to their own standards. If they profess to be grand, benevolent platforms that are welcoming to all, then they should behave accordingly by allowing disagreeable speech to flourish. If, however, they purport to be platforms for progressive speech, then censoring conservatives is their prerogative. Content moderation is fine, as long as companies are honest with themselves—and us.</td>

      <td>Clinton and Pelosi can’t let go of their enemy.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump’s Presidency ends on Wednesday at noon, as the Constitution stipulates. One question to ponder is who will miss him more—his friends or his foes?<br />Our guess is the latter. And if you doubt it, consider the chat between Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton Monday on Mrs. Clinton’s “You and Me Both” podcast. They’re addicted to the man.<br />“I would love to see [Mr. Trump’s] phone records to see whether he was talking to Putin the day that the insurgents invaded our Capitol,” Mrs. Clinton said. The former first lady, who has never accepted the results of the 2016 election, is immune to the irony that in claiming he really won the election President Trump is following her pre-election advice to Joe Biden to “not concede under any circumstance.”<br />Mrs. Pelosi said during the podcast that she once told Mr. Trump that “with you, Mr. President, all roads lead to Putin.” She added that the Capitol rioters “were doing Putin’s business when they did that at the incitement of an insurrection by the President of the United States.” When Mrs. Clinton asked whether the country needs “a 9/11-type commission to investigate and report everything that they can pull together,” Mrs. Pelosi responded “I do.” Though she says she doesn’t know what it is, she suggested Mr. Putin must have something on him “politically, financially or personally.”<br />Maybe they should have a special counsel spend years investigating Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia. Wait, they already did that.</td>

      <td>Biden’s Treasury nominee adapts and extends her views.</td>
      <td>We have our policy disagreements with Janet Yellen, but there’s no denying she is a fine economist. So it was startling to hear her speak like a fact-hedging politician on Tuesday during her Senate confirmation hearing to be Joe Biden’s Treasury secretary. To wit, she did some on-the-fly editing of the economic literature to justify an increase in the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.<br />“Very minimal,” Ms. Yellen said in reply to a question by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott about the employment impact of Mr. Biden’s proposal to raise the federal minimum to $15 from $7.25. As evidence, she cited studies comparing employment in states that raised their minimum wage with neighboring ones that didn’t.<br />But those studies have yielded conflicting findings, and the economic literature overwhelmingly shows that raising the minimum wage reduces employment among teens and unskilled or inexperienced workers. Ms. Yellen acknowledged as much during a Congressional hearing in 2014 when she was asked about Barack Obama’s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10.<br />“I think almost all economists think that the minimum wage has two main effects,” she replied. One is increasing pay for some low-paid workers, and the second is “there would be some amount of negative impact on employment.” How much is a matter of “considerable debate,” she said, adding that she “wouldn’t argue” with the Congressional Budget Office estimate that Mr. Obama’s hike would cost 500,000 jobs.<br />That impact won’t be “very minimal” if you’re among those who might have had one of those 500,000 lost jobs. And that number is likely to increase substantially if the minimum wage more than doubles to $15.</td>

Things were terrible; there was wreckage all around, and yet a sense of optimism must have been pervasive.<br />One part of our long national nightmare ends Wednesday as Donald Trump slinks off to Mar-a-Lago in disgrace, and Joe Biden takes over as president. Yet Mr. Trump leaves behind a second national nightmare: a raging pandemic and, largely for that reason, a sputtering economy.<br />When it comes to handling the pandemic, Mr. Trump has set the bar very low. Doing a better job than his predecessor will be a piece of cake for Mr. Biden. But “better” is not nearly good enough when record numbers of Americans are falling ill and dying. Mr. Biden must do vastly better. His comprehensive plans suggest that he will.<br />Public health is not my bailiwick, so I’ll concentrate on the economics. The national economy today is in passable shape given the unfolding health catastrophe, and the Cares Act of March 2020 is one major reason why. The law showed that Congress had learned two crucial lessons about fighting crises: Go fast, and go big. The Cares Act did both—and as a result it wasn’t as meticulously designed as it could have been.<br />There’s a third lesson: Don’t withdraw emergency support too soon. Mr. Biden clearly understands all three.</td>

      <td>Facebook and Twitter once positioned themselves as champions of an open internet. No longer.</td>
      <td>Social-media giants are under attack for censorship, but a few years ago they positioned themselves as champions of free speech. At issue was “net neutrality,” the Obama-era policy that treated internet service providers like  Comcast  and  AT&T  as common carriers—akin to the old Ma Bell monopoly—by prohibiting them from discriminating among content providers, including the social-media sites.<br />“Net neutrality is the idea that the internet should be free and open for everyone,”  Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerbergdeclared in July 2017 after the Federal Communications Commission’s then-chairman, Ajit Pai, moved to repeal the regulation, which the FCC had adopted two years earlier.  Twitter ’s  public-policy manager, Laura Culbertson, wrote: “Free expression is part of our company DNA. We are the platform that lets users see what’s happening and to see all sides. . . . Without Net Neutrality in force, ISPs would even be able to block content they don’t like, reject apps and content that compete with their own offerings, and arbitrarily discriminate against particular content providers by prioritizing certain Internet traffic over theirs.”<br />Facebook and Twitter turned out to be more threatening than under threat. Broadband providers haven’t attempted to block content or competitors since the FCC repealed net neutrality. But social media, app stores and cloud providers, which were never subject to the rules, all have engaged in censorship repeatedly in recent weeks.<br />Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat moved in lockstep to shut down Donald Trump’s accounts. Google and  Apple  banned the social-media app Parler, which promotes itself as a free-speech alternative to Twitter.  Amazon  Web Services booted Parler from its cloud, banishing it from the web until it could arrange service from another provider.<br />Appeals by big tech companies to protect an “open and free Internet” were always dubious. They had an interest in supporting net neutrality because it put them at an advantage. Among other things, the rule prohibited broadband providers from charging bandwidth guzzlers like Google’s YouTube, Amazon and Facebook more to upload their content at faster speeds.</td>

      <td>Long-running battle involves concerns about racial and gender diversity</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday stepped into the middle of a long-running battle over federal limits on media ownership in local markets, weighing whether a recent regulatory rollback sufficiently addressed concerns about racial and gender diversity.<br />At issue was the Federal Communications Commission’s 2017 decision to loosen ownership restrictions by making it easier for one entity to own multiple TV stations in the same market. The rollback also repealed bans on common ownership of both a TV station and a newspaper in the same market, or a TV station and a radio station.<br />Some ownership limits had been in place for decades, to prevent concentration and preserve viewpoint diversity in local markets.<br />A federal appeals court in 2019 found the FCC didn’t satisfy its legal obligation to determine whether the rollback was in the public interest—because it didn’t adequately assess whether the changes would harm ownership of broadcast media by women and minorities. The FCC and a group of media companies, including  News Corp ,  owner of The Wall Street Journal, appealed to the high court.<br />During an hour-long oral argument, justices pressed both sides in the dispute, but several appeared sympathetic to claims by the FCC and the media companies that the old limits were outdated and didn’t take into account a changing media landscape.</td>

      <td>For President Washington, holding public ofﬁce was a responsibility assumed, not an opportunity exploited.</td>
      <td>It ranks with the filibuster and the chaplain’s prayer among the hoariest traditions of the United States Senate: Every year since 1896, on or about Feb. 22, a member reads into the record George Washington’s Farewell Address. Washington’s prose, as honed by his ghostwriters James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, does not easily translate into the parlance of soundbite politics. But the dangers identified by the retiring president—excessive partisanship, sectional over national loyalties, misplaced allegiance to foreign powers—are as contemporary as the latest tweetstorm.<br />According to Stephen Howard Browne, a professor of communications at Penn State, the lawmakers may be listening to the wrong speech. To Mr. Browne it is Washington’s first inaugural address, delivered on April 30, 1789, that offers a classic defense of republican virtue as the linchpin of popular government. “I walk on untrodden ground,” the new president there acknowledged, his every action defining the scope of executive authority for all who would follow. In the years since, countless writers have retraced his footsteps, leading Mr. Browne himself to wonder: “Have we not had quite enough of George Washington?”<br />The question answers itself in this deceptively slender volume, in which Mr. Browne skillfully synthesizes biography, travelogue, social and political history, and rhetorical analysis to reach fresh conclusions about the relationship between individual and national character. Long before he took the oath of office on the balcony of New York’s Federal Hall, Washington had enshrined duty over self-advancement in his personal code. He demonstrated as much at the close of the Revolution, when mutinous officers in the Continental Army contemplated marching on Congress, until they were shamed out of it by their victorious general.<br />“That Americans have been spared the trauma of the military coup d’état,” writes Mr. Browne, “is owing in no small measure to a general insistent on the privilege of civil authority, who, wielding the sword in battle, laid it down in peace and left it there.” Can there be any stronger proof on this Inauguration Day of Washington’s continuing relevance? For him, no less than for his 20th-century admirer Dwight Eisenhower, the presidency was no promotion. On the eve of his investiture, fearing the toll of public controversy on his reputation, Washington confessed to emotions “as painful . . . as they are pleasing.” That he should nurse such feelings while being rowed across New York Harbor to the deafening cheers of his countrymen says much about this 18th-century idealist without illusions.<br />Hero worship exacted a high price, as Mr. Browne illustrates in tracking Washington’s triumphal two-week “inaugural journey” from Mount Vernon, Va., to New York City. Since visits from local notables would inconvenience private homeowners, the traveler opted to stay in “public houses” everywhere along his route. In Philadelphia, a massive parade ushered him down Market Street to City Tavern and yet another celebratory dinner, culminating in a toast (his 14th of the evening) to “government without oppression, and liberty without licentiousness.” The author enlivens Washington’s road trip with revealing detours into the president-elect’s spiritual outlook (he reserved his most fervent belief for religious tolerance and faith itself as a bulwark of public order); his attitude toward “the people”; and the seeds of American exceptionalism.</td>

      <td>The left will try to convince Biden he has a mandate for progressive change. He doesn’t.</td>
      <td>When Barack Obama and Joe Biden entered the White House 12 years ago, the economy was in recession, unemployment was pushing 8%, and their fellow Democrats controlled the House and Senate. Sound familiar?<br />We know what happened next. Instead of focusing on economic growth, the Obama administration advanced an expensive but ineffective stimulus package and then went all in on a partisan transformation of the U.S. health-care system. The upshot was the slowest economic recovery since World War II. Democrats lost their House majority in 2010, and Republicans won the Senate four years later.<br />We’re about to find out what, if anything, Mr. Biden and his more liberal allies took away from that experience. Mr. Biden has said that his first order of business as president will be addressing Covid-19 and the economy. What we don’t know is whether the political left intends to let him do that. The progressive wing of the Democratic Party is much stronger than it was in 2009, and its members of Congress are far more numerous. Back then, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren did not command the national attention that they do today, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wasn’t old enough to buy beer.<br />On the campaign trail, Mr. Biden tried to put some rhetorical distance between himself and more radical proposals like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All. It’s a strategy that obviously served him well in the election, but how well will it work for him in the White House?<br />When George W. Bush left office, his job-approval rating was in the mid-30s, and the incoming Obama administration interpreted Mr. Bush’s unpopularity as a mandate for its progressive agenda. That miscalculation cost Democrats control of Congress, and Republicans today are anticipating more such overreach under President Biden. Donald Trump didn’t lose re-election because he pulled out of the Paris climate agreement or prioritized securing the southern border or banned travel to the U.S. from countries with a history of coddling terrorists. Liberals who insist otherwise aren’t only kidding themselves but risk repeating the mistakes of a decade ago.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Alejandro Mayorkas, President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for Homeland Security secretary, told a Senate hearing Tuesday he would work to ensure that an attack like the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol wouldn’t be repeated, though his confirmation by Inauguration Day appeared to be delayed.<br />Mr. Biden’s team had named Mr. Mayorkas as one of a handful of national-security nominees it wanted confirmed on Inauguration Day because of continuing domestic threats. In 2017, the Senate confirmed both President Trump’s homeland security and defense nominees on Inauguration Day. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who is set to become the chamber’s majority leader on Wednesday, said on the Senate floor he hoped Mr. Mayorkas would be confirmed on Inauguration Day.<br />That timeline appeared less likely Tuesday after Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) said he would object to an attempt to fast-track the nomination. Mr. Hawley expressed concern about the incoming Biden administration’s plan to undo much of Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda, along with an expected push to create a pathway to citizenship for 11 million immigrants without a permanent legal status.<br />Mr. Hawley, who was the first senator to announce he would formally object to certifying the election results on Jan. 6, has faced a backlash from colleagues and donors since that day. Many Senate Republicans blame him for what they see as his role in instigating the riot that resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer.<br />Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and Mr. Schumer met Tuesday to iron out details of a power-sharing agreement in a Senate divided evenly along party lines.  Under a similar agreement in 2001, nominees and bills could advance to the floor even if a committee vote tied.</td>

      <td>Chuck Norris’s whompin’ stompin lawman is turned into a soft-spoken hero encumbered by uncertainties.</td>
      <td>If you’re looking for whompin’, stompin’, kung-fu-administered rear-end alignments of the Chuck Norris variety, “Walker” may come as a surprise. It will be an understandable surprise: The show is a reboot, pun intended, of the old Norris vehicle “Walker, Texas Ranger,” in which acting, dramaturgy and plausibility took a back seat to the martial-arts prowess of Mr. Norris, the instant gratification that comes with bad guys being righteously thumped and the moral justification of violence, judiciously applied.<br />In “Walker,” Jared Padalecki (“Supernatural”) plays a far more nuanced edition of Cordell Walker, Texas ranger—lawman, father and widower, though not necessarily in that order; Walker’s priorities are poised to be a central part of the series’ plotlines and motivations. Where Mr. Norris was largely impenetrable, Mr. Padalecki is a wide-open book, riven with uncertainties, apt to make the wrong move. His Walker is established as something quite unusual: a law-and-order hero with no sense of authority.<br />This may well change, as only the pilot was available to review and, as with most new shows, the introductory episode is hampered by the task of having to introduce everything. That said, the show’s creator, Anna Fricke, might have done this more tidily. The opening moments of the first episode involve the death of Walker’s wife, Emily (Genevieve Padalecki), under circumstances that go unexplained, as do the man’s anguished cries when he hears gunshots over her cellphone while appearing otherwise paralyzed into inaction. The next thing we know, we’ve leapt ahead, to an evening in which Walker is late for his own welcome-home party, an event that provides some shorthand on the rest of the cast and their interrelationships, but not on where Walker’s been, why or for how long. He mutters something about “more than a month,” someone else later says “three months” but it’s hard to tell: All this soft-spoken Texas muttering may be regionally authentic, but it doesn’t help with the details.<br />Everyone’s mad at Walker, at any rate, especially his kids, Stella (Violet Brinson) and Augie (Kale Culley), since he seems to have disappeared right after their mother died. Not only has Mr. Padalecki’s character thus been cast as less than forthright and take-charge, it is suggested that he ran away at precisely the time his kids needed him. Rather than rush home to see them when he gets back from his mysterious mission, he parks his enormous pickup truck in a public park. Where he starts drinking. Only to be taken into custody by State Trooper Micki Ramirez (Lindsey Morgan), who, just coincidentally, is about the become a Texas Ranger and—gasp—Walker’s partner.<br />The moral grayness of “Walker” will give the show’s writers no end of material, especially since the series seems positioned to be family friendly, moralistic, vaguely Christian and averse to the kind of mayhem that distinguished the program’s predecessor: Walker does beat down one deserving, smart-mouthed drug smuggler, but then gets chastised by everyone including his supervisor (Coby Bell) and has to promise to be better. You have to ask yourself, what would Chuck Norris do?</td>

      <td>John Lurie’s new show is an odd collage of nature watching, storytelling and art instruction.</td>
      <td>Thirty years ago, John Lurie, the musician, composer, actor and personification of “downtown” New York—when “downtown” meant something culturally specific—had a television series called “Fishing With John.” It masqueraded, with little discernible effort, as a nature-sports program, but was really about Mr. Lurie and his “guests,” who were his friends and collaborators: Jim Jarmusch, Tom Waits, Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon, Dennis Hopper. The show lasted six episodes, but attained a cult following and is available in a Criterion Collection edition and on Criterion Channel.<br />Mr. Lurie’s new show, “Painting With John,” is a very different kind of show—part one-man chat show, part art class—albeit with a similar attitude toward TV genres. Talking into a camera like it’s a real person?, he asks. It’s so artificial. It’s so wrong. “People who can actually do it well?” he says in episode 3. “They’re probably sociopaths.” In fact, he says that the more shows he has done in the series, the better he’s gotten at it, and “the worse and worse person I’ve become.”<br />Clearly, the six-episode season is not out to seduce it’s audience with warmth and fuzziness, but the pacing, the insouciance, the music (Mr. Lurie’s) and the surprising vividness of the colors and the artwork make for a show that engages a viewer sincerely, even while being a semi-spoof: The first episode is called “Bob Ross Was Wrong” (meaning “Everyone can’t paint”). And though Mr. Lurie says he intended the show to be “educational,” he’s an intuitive painter and how can you teach intuition?<br />It’s the kind of question that leads him to tell stories—about his parents for instance, and how they never stifled the creative impulses of him or his brother and fellow musician Evan, who as a young child would assume a character such as Rin-Tin-Tin and “demand to have his dinner served to him on the floor in a bowl.” They never scolded him, but rather played along. (“Rin-Tin-Tin! It’s time for dinner!”) In ways both roundabout and very direct, Mr. Lurie is turning a show whose sensibility is casual into something instructive, without pedantry, or technical expertise: Each episode begins with Mr. Lurie crashing his drone (or seven, at one point) in an attempt to provide an introductory overview of the undisclosed Caribbean island he calls home. At one point he asks why’s he’s doing the show at all. “In fact, if you’re watching, turn it off.” I couldn’t oblige.<br />The show has three essential elements: island scenery; Mr. Lurie’s stories; and his various works in progress—paintings that combine mosaic-like fragments made of oil or watercolor and suggest Gustav Klimt with the delicate flora of a Japanese Edo-period landscape. The act of painting is absorbing in its delicacy; the programs in their entirety are haiku-like—short, seemingly spontaneous, but in fact precisely constructed. (It is a one-man show save for occasional appearances by Nesrin Wolf and Ann Mary Gludd Jones, who work for Mr. Lurie and perhaps live with him.)</td>

      <td>Microsoft Corp.  is investing in  General Motors Co. ’s driverless-car startup Cruise as part of a strategic tie-up, another sign of renewed interest in the autonomous-technology space after a relatively quiet period.<br />Microsoft is among a group of companies that will invest more than $2 billion in San Francisco-based Cruise, which has been majority-owned by GM since early 2016. The financing brings Cruise’s valuation to $30 billion, Cruise said Tuesday, up from an estimated $19 billion in spring 2019.<br />GM is adding to its Cruise investment as part of the funding round and will retain a majority stake, a Cruise spokesman said. The investment also includes current stakeholder  Honda Motor Co.  and other institutional investors that Cruise declined to name.<br />Under terms of Tuesday’s deal, Cruise will use Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing service to help it roll out autonomous-vehicle services. Cruise for years has been testing driverless cars in San Francisco and plans an eventual robot-taxi service. It is also is exploring commercial delivery.<br />Driverless cars are expected to throw off troves of data for autonomous-service operators to capture, store and eventually monetize, analysts say. Even on today’s cars, auto makers and tech companies are mobilizing to harness data from the growing number of vehicles with internet connections.</td>

      <td>New directive, aimed at a 2020 Supreme Court ruling, comes in the waning moments of the Trump administration</td>
      <td>The Justice Department has issued a memo that aims to limit the impact of a landmark Supreme Court ruling that protects gay and transgender people in the workplace, a last-minute attempt by the Trump administration to influence policy as President-elect Joe Biden begins assembling new leadership at the agency.<br />The Supreme Court’s June ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County said a bedrock federal civil-rights law prohibits employers from discriminating against workers on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The 6-3 opinion, written by a Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch, rejected the administration’s arguments that federal civil rights law provides no protection to LGBT employees.<br />The new memo, dated Sunday and sent by the acting head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, acknowledges the court’s ruling was sweeping, but says the department should not extend it further to areas such as housing and education, where longstanding gender-based policies on bathrooms and sports teams could come into play. The 23-page memo, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, also suggests that some employers could cite religious beliefs that would allow them to discriminate against LGBT employees.<br />“Unlike racial discrimination, the Supreme Court has never held that a religious employer’s decision not to hire homosexual or transgender persons ‘violates deeply and widely accepted views of elementary justice’ or that the government has a ‘compelling’ interest in the eradication of such conduct,” the memo says.<br />A DOJ spokeswoman didn’t have an immediately comment on the memo.</td>

Overall, Netflix signed up what it said was a record 37 million subscribers in 2020 and had a total of 203.7 million users when the year finished up.<br />The company’s subscriber count has roughly doubled since the third quarter of 2017, when it first exceeded 100 million paying customers.<br />The pandemic has charged Netflix’s growth as consumer cut back on a range of leisure activities—from dining out and vacations to visiting theaters and concert venues—to comply with lockdown orders and limit the risk of infection. With many people spending more time at home, streaming demand jumped, bolstering Netflix as well as its competitors.<br />The Los Gatos, Calif., company said it generated $6.64 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up from $5.45 billion for the year earlier and exceeding analysts’ forecasts. But profit decreased to $542 million, or $1.19 a share, from $587 million, or $1.30 a share, the year earlier. Analysts predicted $1.36 a share for the latest period, according to FactSet.</td>

      <td>ROME—Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte survived a confidence vote in the country’s Senate but fell short of an outright majority, weakening his government as it searches for a way to tame the Covid-19 pandemic and revive the economy.<br />The vote in the Senate was triggered by the decision of a small centrist party led by a former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, to withdraw from the governing coalition. Mr. Renzi said he objected to Mr. Conte’s plans for spending more than 200 billion euros, equivalent to $243 billion, in European Union loans and grants to support the economic recovery after the pandemic.<br />Mr. Conte garnered 156 votes in favor of his left-leaning government and 140 against, with Mr. Renzi’s party abstaining. After falling short of an absolute majority in Italy’s 321-member Senate, Mr. Conte could struggle in the future when he seeks to pass legislation. The government previously relied on Mr. Renzi’s group for its Senate majority.<br />“We will have a weak government precisely when we would need a very strong one,” said Valentina Meliciani, an economics professor at LUISS University in Rome.<br />The government won a confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament on Monday, where it has a stronger majority. If Mr. Conte had lost the Senate vote he would have been forced to resign, paving the way to either a new governing coalition or a snap election, which opinion polls suggest the right-of-center opposition parties would win.</td>

The complaint is among the first to charge multiple alleged members of the mob with conspiracy in connection with the events of Jan. 6.<br />Around eight to 10 people wearing helmets, reinforced vests and clothing with paraphernalia identifying themselves of the right-wing militia group Oath Keepers moved in a tactical fashion and forced their way to the front of the crowd, a video cited in the complaint shows.<br />During the breach, one of the members allegedly communicated: “We have a good group.

They were provoked by the president and other powerful people and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday.<br />Mr. McConnell has said he is considering whether he would vote to convict Mr. Trump during his second impeachment trial, which will take place after Mr. Trump leaves office. The House passed an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump last week, focused on his statements encouraging his supporters to march on the Capitol.<br />How Mr. McConnell votes will be central to whether enough Republicans join Democrats in the Senate to convict Mr. Trump. A two-thirds supermajority is needed to convict in presidential impeachment trials, meaning 17 Republicans would need to support conviction for it to succeed.<br />Some Republicans, though, have said they don’t believe that holding an impeachment trial for someone who no longer holds office is constitutional. Democrats will soon control a majority in the Senate.</td>

But Mr. Biden has already passed on an even greater opportunity. When  Facebook ,  YouTube,  Twitter  and Apple shut down competing social media; as banks declined to do business with President Trump; as pundits called for ostracizing all Trump administration officials from future employment; as CEOs at major American corporations rushed to decline commerce with people who dared voice their worry about the fairness of the presidential election, Mr. Biden could have taken the stage and shouted that enough was enough. He could have pounded the podium and told social-media companies to “stand down” and open their channels to all Americans again; scolded businesses that it isn’t “American” to close your markets to people with differing political opinions; declared that we don’t deny people who serve this country future employment because we see the world through a different political prism and demanded an end to self-aggrandizing attacks on the millions of our fellow citizens who voted for President Trump.<br />How could the social-media moguls and the Amazons, Citibanks and Targets of the world refuse such a request for unity? It would have been, and still might be, as historic a gesture as Abraham Lincoln’s call for unity as the Civil War drew to a close. But our newly elected president has done none of these things.

This is the more significant reason for a result at odds with the popular vote.<br />The Electoral College “causes candidates to campaign heavily in ‘battleground states’ while ignoring those they think they are certain to carry or not.” Battleground states are entirely the result of “winner take all.” Take California—the most populous state and one that is overwhelmingly Democratic. Under “winner take all” it is a miracle that any presidential candidate, Republican or Democratic, campaigns there. If, on the other hand, electoral votes were allocated proportional to the statewide vote, essentially as in Maine and Nebraska, both candidates would spend a lot of time in California. Under a proportional allocation even the loser in California could garner a substantial number of electoral votes.<br />“Winner take all” is not part of the Electoral College nor is it to be found anywhere else in the Constitution. It is a creature of state law.<br />Finally, if even without the misconceptions one is still impelled to abolish the Electoral College, there is no reason to stop there. The Electoral College perfectly mirrors Congress, and the Senate should be the next to go.<br />John J. Ronayne</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal appeals court on Tuesday vacated the Trump administration’s rules that eased restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants, potentially making it easier for the incoming Biden administration to reset rules targeting climate emissions.<br />A 2-1 majority on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decided to send the Affordable Clean Energy rule back to the Environmental Protection Agency, ruling the Trump administration adopted an unlawfully narrow view of federal clean-air law.<br />If upheld or unchallenged, the ruling would undo a major Trump administration environmental initiative that intended to give states and electric utilities more flexibility in how they reduced their emissions of heat-trapping gasses.<br />The decision could make it easier for President-elect Joe Biden to fulfill a campaign promise to put more stringent limits on the power industry’s emissions. Mr. Biden has called for eliminating carbon-dioxide emissions from the power sector by 2035, and Tuesday’s ruling would allow him to push toward doing so without first trying to repeal or overhaul a set of rules put in place by conservatives.<br />Power plant emissions have long been one of the top two U.S. sources of greenhouse-gas emissions, putting them in the crosshairs of attempts by government to address global warming. The rules vacated Tuesday were an attempt by the Trump administration to overhaul the first-ever U.S. rules on these emissions, the Clean Power Plan, put in place by the Obama administration.</td>

Dr. Hahn has designated Dr. Woodcock as interim commissioner at least until a permanent commissioner is nominated and confirmed, a designation that is expected to be seconded Wednesday by the Biden transition team.<br />Dr. Woodcock joined the FDA in 1986, and has most recently overseen the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. During the past year, she has been on detail to the drug portion of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s multi-agency task force to speed the development of Covid-19-related drugs and other medical products.<br />The Biden transition team didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the FDA post, and Dr. Woodcock declined to comment.<br />Dr. Hahn is stepping down after a tumultuous tenure in which his agency was regularly attacked by President Trump, who claimed it didn’t move quickly enough to expedite approval of a Covid-19 vaccine.</td>

      <td>Things may improve for banks, but without loan demand, revenue growth will still be hard to come by</td>
      <td>Heading into 2021, it appears that things aren’t getting any worse for bank stocks. But it may be some time before they get much better.<br />Bank of America  executives on Tuesday suggested that the bank’s net interest income likely bottomed in the third quarter, rising about 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter, and that the fourth quarter of 2021 will likely look much better than the first.  JPMorgan Chase  last week reported 2% quarter-over-quarter growth in net interest income, and expects a pickup in 2021 versus 2020. The two banks had reported 2020 declines of 11% and 5% in net interest income, respectively.<br />One reason for optimism, widely cited across banks, is how much cash banks can still shift into their securities portfolios. Even absent any pickup in loan demand, banks can continue to put cash generated by deposits into fixed-income securities that pick up more yield.<br />Still, the road to much improved interest income across banks isn’t straightforward. One challenge is that mortgages continue to be prepaid because of a surge in refinancing, which affects mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America cited this as having a significant impact on its net interest yield. Banks have so much cash to deploy that they can still make gains in yields net of this effect. But where mortgage rates go could be a huge swing factor.<br />There is certainly hope in the shape of the yield curve. Banks across the board noted the recent steepening of the curve, as long-term rates have risen, as a big benefit. For example, the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasuries is as wide as it has been since 2017. However, banks have reasons to be cautious about simply buying longer-term fixed-income securities, as this could cause them to miss out on future rate increases.</td>

Chuck Schumer, will meet Tuesday to iron out the details of a power-sharing agreement in a Senate divided evenly along party lines.<br />Georgia on Tuesday formally certified Democratic victories for its two recent Senate races, ensuring that Democrats will take control of the chamber for the first time since 2015. Democrats will formally gain the Senate majority once the three new senators from California and Georgia are sworn in on Wednesday afternoon, because Vice President-elect Kamala Harris wields a tiebreaking vote. The chamber already is moving ahead with the confirmation process for some of President-elect Joe Biden’s cabinet nominees and is expected to hold an impeachment trial of President Trump, though its timing hasn’t been determined.<br />In the past, a 50-50 Senate has meant that while each party gets an equal number of committee seats, the majority party holds committee chairmanships and controls the agenda, setting the schedule for nominees and legislation to come to the floor for votes. When the Senate last had a power-sharing arrangement, in 2001, that meant that nominees and bills could advance to the floor even if a committee vote was tied. The arrangements this time around are still being negotiated, however, and it isn’t known what rules will be in place.<br />In addition to hashing out a power-sharing agreement, Messrs. McConnell (R., Ky.) and Schumer (D., N.Y.) will discuss a Covid-19 relief package and nominees, a person familiar with the matter said. Both Republicans and Democrats are looking to the 2001 arrangement as a model, this person said.<br />In remarks on the Senate floor at noon Tuesday, Mr. McConnell argued that November’s elections didn’t hand any side a mandate for broad ideological change.</td>

      <td>LONDON—The London Metal Exchange is proposing closing its open-outcry ring, where traders have swapped metals like copper and lead using shouts and hand signals for 144 years, in a bid to attract more financial players to its marketplace.<br />The LME temporarily closed the ring when Covid-19 ripped through the U.K. in March, judging the tight circle of red couches that dozens of traders crowd around to be a health risk. The exchange, owned by  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. , is now floating the idea of shutting the ring for good.<br />The ring began life when the LME was founded above a London hat shop in 1877, though its origins date to sawdust circles around which merchants bought and sold metals in the early 1800s, when they were in high demand as the industrial revolution gathered steam. It survived two world wars, the decline of the U.K. as the world’s leading industrial economy and the rise of China as the largest metals consumer.<br />However, the coronavirus pandemic may prove to be its undoing. Launching a consultation on the proposed closure Tuesday, the LME said electronic pricing had served the market well during the pandemic and would bring greater transparency around the way that prices are set.<br />The ring’s long-term survival in the face of electronic trading has long been debated. The LME had previously experimented with setting closing prices electronically on a small scale in the nickel market. Covid-19 prompted the exchange to run that trial across the gamut of metals and contract dates.</td>

The Chinese government has in the past denied mistreating the Uighur population, who mainly live in the Xinjiang region, and defended its program of detaining large numbers of Uighurs as necessary to root out terrorism and provide job-training.<br />Accusations of genocide by the State Department are rare, and the State Department declaration came on the Trump administration’s last day.

      <td>Justice Department alleges academic who appeared on CNN and NPR and met with U.S. officials received a salary from Iran</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Justice Department filed charges against an Iranian academic, alleging that he covertly drew a salary from the government of Iran while living and working in the U.S. as a professor, political scientist and Middle East expert.<br />In a criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday in Brooklyn federal court, the government charged Kaveh Afrasiabi, an Iranian citizen with U.S. permanent residency, with two counts of acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Typically, first-time offenders receive well below the maximum penalty.<br />The government alleges that Mr. Afrasiabi has been receiving a salary—totaling at least $265,000—from the Iranian mission to the United Nations since at least 2007, and health-care benefits since at least 2011. During that time, the complaint says, he helped Iran shape its public messaging in the media and advocated Iranian government positions at the highest levels of U.S. government.<br />Mr. Afrasiabi made contact with numerous U.S. government officials without disclosing his ties to the Iranian government, according to the government, including an unnamed member of Congress and his staff as well as a senior official in the State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs.<br />Such consulting activity usually requires a public registration with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a law designed to bring transparency to the advocacy work of foreign states. In recent years, the Justice Department has reinvigorated its enforcement of the foreign-agents law, charging a number of lobbyists, consultants, business figures and academics for failing to disclose their ties to foreign states or foreign income.</td>

      <td>Armin Laschet and his party hope to keep the boring times rolling.</td>
      <td>Germany took another step Saturday in its long transition to whatever will come after Angela Merkel, as the country’s largest party elected Armin Laschet as leader. As head of Mrs. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, Mr. Laschet is in pole position to succeed her as chancellor after October elections—for boring or worse.<br />This marks the CDU’s second attempt to find a political heir for Mrs. Merkel, after Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer’s ascent to the party leadership in late 2018. AKK, as she’s known, was Mrs. Merkel’s preferred successor but proved inept at managing tensions among factions within the CDU. A string of poor state election results for the CDU hastened her exit last year amid a ruckus over cooperation between some local CDU candidates and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).<br />With Mr. Laschet, the CDU is attempting the same policy strategy embodied by AKK. He represents continuity with Mrs. Merkel in almost all respects, from his timidity on domestic economic reforms to his sympathy for Russia and enthusiasm for closer economic ties with China. The party on Saturday again rebuffed Friedrich Merz, who ran against Mr. Laschet and against AKK in 2018 on a free-market reform platform. CDU convention delegates also knocked out foreign-policy hawk Norbert Röttgen.<br />It’s a bet that when they elect a new parliament this year, Germans will want more of Mrs. Merkel’s brand of wooly centrism. But if that turns out to be true, it will be by default. State election results and opinion polls suggest the CDU and its Bavarian sister the CSU remain Germany’s plurality party but with markedly diminishing support.<br />Meanwhile, German politics is drifting away from Mrs. Merkel’s breed of consensus. Despite winning a leadership election among delegates to the CDU party conference, Mr. Laschet’s soft foreign-policy views are increasingly at odds with prominent CDU figures who advocate a sterner approach to Russia and China. The Greens are on the rise as a mainstream center-left party on the back of their foreign-policy hawkishness and hostility to crony capitalism at home.</td>

      <td>Abolishing the tipped minimum wage would wipe out the benefit of his Covid grants.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden proposes $15 billion in relief grants for America’s Covid-crushed businesses. But he also wants to mandate a new minimum wage that for many restaurants would wipe out the benefit and then some.<br />Restaurants shed some six million jobs in the first two months of the pandemic. As a consequence of continued Covid-related closures and a decline in customer traffic, the industry ended 2020 with 2.5 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic. They received a temporary lifeline through the Paycheck Protection Program, but have advocated without success for more-substantial relief. Mr. Biden’s recovery plan acknowledges restaurants were “disproportionately” harmed by Covid.<br />But he also proposes to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, which more than doubles the existing minimum, $7.25 an hour. The separate minimum for tipped workers is $2.13 an hour, and the president-elect proposes to raise that to $15 too—an increase of more than 600%. Tipped workers are already required to earn the full federal minimum between their base wage and tips, and most earn far more.<br />The relief grants wouldn’t come close to offsetting this new mandate. Consider the math for a small full-service restaurant location in West Virginia with five servers, where the tipped-wage minimum is $2.62 an hour. Mr. Biden’s plan would raise the hourly cost of each server by $12.38, or $19,313 annually for a 30-hour workweek. With payroll taxes, that’s roughly $100,000 in new annual costs, compared with the average Covid relief grant of $15,000 per small business.<br />A recent study from economists at Miami and Trinity universities finds a plan like Mr. Biden’s would cost the hospitality industry more than one million jobs—including nearly 700,000 held by tipped workers. A Census Bureau study shows that restaurant workers see lower tips in states with a higher minimum wage, a likely consequence of restaurants’ transition towards self-service models. Unsurprisingly, tipped workers oppose Mr. Biden’s plan.</td>

      <td>Describing his plan to get the Covid-19 pandemic under control, Joe Biden was blunt. “You have my word,” the president-elect declared last week. “We will manage the hell out of this operation.” He had better. Anything less would be a body blow to his administration and the country.<br />When there is widespread agreement on a course of action, leaders are judged on how well they carry it out. In her 2016 book, “Why Presidents Fail,” my Brookings Institution colleague Elaine Kamarck shows how management failures can make or break presidencies. Jimmy Carter never recovered from the failed mission to rescue American hostages in Iran, nor did George W. Bush from his botched response to Hurricane Katrina. The implosion of the Affordable Care Act’s website significantly weakened the Obama presidency.<br />This is all the more important when policies affect individuals directly, because these policies inform how society perceives the competence of its institutions and leaders. Savvy politicians understand that attitudes toward government are shaped by motor-vehicle departments and Veterans Affairs hospitals. Members of Congress quickly learn that constituent services in their local offices matter at least as much as voting records. Helping constituents navigate complex bureaucracies affects not only them but the stories they tell their friends and neighbors.<br />You never get a second chance to make a first impression, and managing the pandemic will be the first impression President Biden makes. If he gets it right, he will strengthen his hand in dealing with a divided Congress, and he will begin the long task of rebuilding public trust and confidence in government. If his team botches the job, he will bear the brunt of public disappointment.<br />Mr. Biden has inherited a monumental challenge. The Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed encouraged the development of vaccines in record time, but then hit a snag in logistics. The feds have shipped vaccines more slowly than expected. Many states have been inadequately prepared to pass out the vaccines they receive. Highly publicized instances of line-jumping threaten to weaken confidence in the fairness of the process.</td>

Global health laws requiring countries rapidly share all pertinent information on an emerging threat “lacked teeth,” one of the panelists said. Complex bureaucratic rules, created to prevent the WHO from taking hasty decisions that could hurt the global economy, meant that several weeks were lost before the agency could declare Covid-19 an international public health emergency, Ms. Clark said.<br />“Viruses move in minutes and hours, rather than days and weeks, especially in the highly mobile and interconnected world of today,” said Ms. Clark. “The international system for alert and response has the trappings of an analogue system in a digital age.”</td>

New presidents often wait weeks or months to name CDC directors.</td>

      <td>Electric-vehicle startup Rivian Automotive LLC has raised another $2.65 billion, bolstering its balance sheet as it looks for an edge in the nascent market for electric trucks.<br />Asset manager T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. led the round, which also included Fidelity Investments, Coatue Management and  Amazon.com Inc.,  all of whom have already backed the auto maker, Rivian said Tuesday. The influx of capital for the Irvine, Calif.-based company came at a valuation of $27.6 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter, and adds to the $5.35 billion that the company raised in five earlier funding rounds dating back to 2019.<br />Auto maker  Ford Motor Co.  also holds a stake in Rivian after investing $500 million in 2019. It wasn’t clear whether  Ford  participated in this round.<br />The new money will allow the company to focus on launching three products this year while scaling up for growth, said RJ Scaringe, Rivian’s founder and chief executive, in a statement.<br />The new funding round illustrates that the torrent of new investment into electric-vehicle companies shows no signs of slowing so far in 2021. Investors are betting smaller challengers can take on legacy auto makers, causing valuations for all electric-vehicle companies to balloon over the past year.</td>

      <td>Job cuts aimed at removing overlap arising from acquisition of TNT package-delivery business</td>
      <td>FedEx Corp.  plans to cut up to 6,300 jobs in Europe as it completes the process of combining its Express network with the package-delivery operations of its TNT unit.<br />The delivery company said Tuesday that it will lay off between 5,500 and 6,300 workers in operational and back-office roles as it seeks to address the overlap resulting from operating two European networks connecting similar geographies.<br />The proposed cuts could affect up to 2.6% of FedEx Express’ roughly 245,000 employees, including about 43,000 at TNT, as of May 31, 2020. The job cuts will differ by country and could be in the form of reassignment to other roles and priority access to open positions.<br />FedEx said it expects severance-benefits costs of between $300 million and $575 million, before taxes, that are expected to be incurred through fiscal 2023. The company sees savings of $275 million to $350 million annually beginning fiscal 2024 as a result of the job reductions.<br />FedEx bought TNT, a Dutch company, in 2016. FedEx at that time had a sizable air-express delivery operation in Europe, but it lagged behind in the ground-delivery business. Acquiring TNT gave it an established door-to-door network in Europe, saving the U.S.-based company the time and money required to build one from scratch.</td>

      <td>Upstart luxury liquidators like Heat and Scarce are offloading surplus clothing from labels like Off-White and Saint Laurent with a twist: The customers have no idea what they’re actually buying</td>
      <td>LAST YEAR, as part of a wave of retail-store closures, discount retailers Century 21 and Stein Mart filed for bankruptcy. Coronavirus, which slowed Americans’ shopping to a crawl, certainly played a part in their fall—and left many of the brands, stores and factories that had relied on these once-beloved “close-out retailers” holding a surfeit of new clothes that no one was really buying.<br />An intriguing new solution for selling overstock, off-season clothing has emerged, however. Two upstart companies—Heat, founded in London in November 2019; and Scarce, launched in New York in December 2020—offer so-called “luxury mystery boxes” that contain clothing items pulled from the surplus stock of boutiques, brands like Moncler, Balenciaga and Off-White, and even factories. Collectively, the items originally retailed for two to three times as much, on average, as the box’s price. The twist: Until the customers open the box and peek inside, they have no idea what they’re getting. That said, boxes are sold by gender, and users can input in advance their pant, shoe and top sizes<br />Joe Wilkinson, one of the co-founders of Heat, explained that he and his partners came across this surprise packaging concept via YouTube. They noticed “a bit of a trend” for videos where YouTubers would film themselves opening “mystery boxes” that they’d acquired either from independent fashion resellers or other YouTubers. In a typical clip, a chatty, college-aged streetwear fan would tear open a box to reveal some rare Adidas, a piece of Yeezy or Supreme merch, or a hard-to-find Palm Angels hoodie. The videos were like an action flick for sneaker addicts and the “what will they pull out next?” suspense kept fans watching. Mr. Wilkinson and his peers decided to turn this gamified unboxing idea into a business, catering to millennial and Gen-Z fashion fans who would watch—or make—these mystery videos.<br />The idea clicked. The day Heat launched, said Mr. Wilkinson, it sold thousands of boxes using a tiered pricing scheme. For around $400 you can acquire a box containing items like T-shirts and small accessories, while roughly $675 gets you a box filled with higher-value hoodies and outerwear. When it comes to selecting their box, which can contain two to a handful of items depending on their price, shoppers can also choose between two broad style categories: “streetwear,” which encompasses brands like Rhude and Ambush, and “contemporary,” which leans on higher-fashion brands like Casablanca and Haider Ackermann.<br />Both Heat and Scarce allow for returns, but customers must return the entire box, not just a single item. If you receive three items, and you adore just one, you will be saddled with the two other so-so items as well. Further, both companies require returns within 14 days and expect customers to assume responsibility for any return shipping fees. Perhaps because of this restrictive, cumbersome process, both companies boast low return rates: Heat claims that 10 to 15% of its boxes are returned, while Scarce reports a 5% return rate.</td>

      <td>The eyes have had it. All that extra scrolling? It’s taking a toll.</td>
      <td>This past year has been, among a great many other things, hard on the eyes. While stress and sleeplessness are contributing to our perpetually tired peepers, another behavioral shift brought on by the pandemic has had a significant impact: a steady rise in screen time. Everything from work to workouts, schooling to socializing, is now being done via video chat. And then there’s the constant doomscrolling that’s an unfortunate new norm. We’re dependent on our screens more than ever, and that’s having an effect not only on our eyes, but on the skin around them as well.<br />It’s understandable, considering the skin around the eyes is easily bothered. “The eyelid skin is the thinnest and most delicate of the body and therefore is one of the first areas to show signs of aging, including fine lines, wrinkles and hyperpigmentation,” says Shari Marchbein, a New York City dermatologist and an assistant professor of clinical dermatology at NYU. Blood vessels are often more visible through thin skin, a problem that becomes more pronounced, says Marchbein, as we age and lose collagen and elastin. The area is also hypersensitive, adds Caroline Robinson, a dermatologist and the founder and CEO of Chicago’s Tone Dermatology. “Our under-eye and eyelid skin are more susceptible to dryness and can more easily become irritated,” she says.<br />The uptick in screen time means more squinting. “Squinting, where we engage the orbicularis oculi muscle, is a top reason that dermatologists see fine lines and wrinkles at the lateral sides of the eyelid known as crow’s-feet,” says Marchbein, who often treats this issue in office with careful placement of botulinum toxin, such as Botox or Dysport, to soften and prevent future deepening of the lines. Too much squinting is also one of a number of symptoms to clue people in that they might need a new pair of glasses or an update to their prescription, says ophthalmologist Rupa Wong. “Squinting, blurry vision, abnormal head posturing, headaches, needing to move screens either closer or farther away are some of the symptoms to look for,” Wong notes.<br />While blue light is emitted primarily by the sun, we’re also exposed to it via our coterie of devices. “Known as HEV [high-energy visible] light, it’s the light in the blue end of the visible spectrum, and it penetrates even deeper into the skin than UV light does,” says Joshua Zeichner, a dermatologist and an associate professor of dermatology at New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital. While there’s solid scientific evidence of the detrimental effect of blue light produced by the sun, researchers are still investigating the impact of device-borne blue light. In general, though, the damage caused by blue light can be significant. “There is mounting evidence that supports blue light’s contribution to photoaging, including wrinkles, skin laxity and hyperpigmentation or brown spots,” says Marchbein. Dermatologists also have good evidence, she adds, to show that blue light triggers skin conditions like melasma. “As blue light penetrates the skin, reactive oxygen species are generated, which leads to DNA damage, thereby causing inflammation and the breakdown of healthy collagen and elastin,” Marchbein explains. “The more time we spend on our devices, the worse off our skin might be.”<br />So, what to do? Eye creams, depending on the active ingredients, can offer some improvement. Aesthetician Georgia Louise recommends looking for products with peptides and mild vitamin A, or retinol, to help address fine lines and wrinkles. Marchbein has found that caffeine can offer modest results for dark circles by constricting blood vessels. For redness and discoloration, she suggests the anti-inflammatory niacinamide and skin-brightening licorice root. According to Marchbein, pronounced puffiness and dark circles often require more invasive, in-office procedures like hyaluronic acid fillers and sometimes surgery. Daily application of vitamin C is important for protecting skin from HEV light–related free-radical damage, says Zeichner. One crucial product in a screen-conscious skin-care regimen, even when you’re spending most of your time indoors, is sunblock. “I recommend a daily broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher, even when indoors,” says Robinson. The key is making sure that the sunblock is a mineral variety with iron oxide on the ingredient list. “The iron-based pigments of the sunscreen help reflect away HEV light to protect the skin,” Zeichner explains. “Unfortunately, traditional chemical sunscreen does not block HEV light at all.”</td>

      <td>The New York Mets fired general manager Jared Porter on Tuesday morning just hours after publication of accusations that he sent explicit, unsolicited texts and images to a female journalist in 2016 when he worked for the Chicago Cubs.<br />The move, which comes just over a month after Porter’s hiring, was announced on Twitter by new team owner Steve Cohen and represents the first crisis of the billionaire hedge-fund manager’s stewardship of the Mets.<br />Major League Baseball also intends to launch an investigation into Porter, which could lead to him being suspended from the sport, a person familiar with the matter said. Former Houston Astros assistant GM Brandon Taubman was indefinitely banned from baseball last January after he made inappropriate comments toward female reporters at a postgame celebration during the 2019 playoffs.<br />ESPN reported that Porter, who was then working as the Cubs’ director of professional scouting, sent more than 60 unanswered messages to the woman, including one of a naked penis. The woman—who was not named and came from a foreign country to cover baseball—told ESPN she believed Porter’s initial interactions with her were of a typical journalist-source relationship, but that his tone quickly turned inappropriate.<br />In the ESPN story, which came out around 11 p.m. ET Monday night, Mets president Sandy Alderson said Porter acknowledged “his serious error in judgment” and that the organization would “review the facts.” Just before 8 a.m., Cohen tweeted that he had terminated the 41-year-old Porter, who finalized a four-year contract in mid-December.</td>

      <td>Economic rebound in year of Covid-19 was unbalanced; growth in domestic consumption lagged behind industrial and export sectors</td>
      <td>HONG KONG—One thing is missing from China’s otherwise remarkable economic recovery: a strong rebound in consumer spending.<br />Even though China was the only major economy to expand during the Covid-19 pandemic last year, its growth remains highly unbalanced, relying heavily on exports of manufactured goods to the U.S. and elsewhere. Domestic consumption has lagged, with retail sales shrinking 3.9% in 2020 from the previous year and demand for imported goods falling slightly.<br />There are many reasons for the weakness. While China’s unemployment rate never shot up as much as unemployment did in the U.S. and Europe, many employers cut salaries or hours, leaving consumers anxious. Many opted to save more—a common tendency in China, which has long had a high savings rate.<br />China’s government also didn’t hand out checks to consumers as the U.S. did, choosing instead to focus stimulus on helping factories and other businesses.<br />Many economists now believe spending weakness will persist in 2021. If it does, it could mean Chinese demand does less than hoped to help lift other economies out of trouble this year.</td>

A nationwide referendum in 2009 also saw Swiss voters support a proposal to ban the construction of minarets for mosques.<br />This time voters are being asked whether Switzerland should ban full-face coverings nationwide after a group including members of the right-wing Swiss People’s Party gathered more than 100,000 signatures, passing the threshold required for a popular vote on changing the constitution. The same group initiated the 2009 vote, describing minarets as foreign to Swiss cultural traditions, sparking a wider debate in Europe about the integration of Muslims at a time when there was growing concern over the influence of Islamist extremists.<br />The debate continues in many parts of Europe, notably France, where President Emmanuel Macron has proposed legislation to outlaw what he calls “Islamist separatism,” and which includes preventing the indoctrination of children during home schooling and online hate speech.<br />France previously prohibited wearing full-face veils in public as a way to support its secular values, as have other European countries.</td>

Under the transaction, expected to close in the first quarter, Sycamore will acquire Azamara’s three ships and intellectual property such as the brand’s logo and slogan, the company added.<br />Royal Caribbean in December said it sold two ships in its Royal Caribbean International fleet.

Owners will also need to seek rezoning and entitlements permits that can take years, during which economic conditions can deteriorate.<br />Consequently, many recent conversion efforts have gone awry, forcing the owner to sell the property at a discount. In other cases, local government authorities have lost patience and bought the owners out.<br />Brookfield Property Partners  LP has made converting all or part of malls one of its prime real-estate strategies. In 2018, the firm bought the two-thirds of mall operator GGP Inc. it didn’t already own, valuing GGP’s property portfolio at around $15 billion. The acquisition reflected Brookfield’s confidence in the mall-conversion strategy, but the real-estate investor has often struggled to make this approach work.</td>

      <td>Wall Street firm’s revenue of $11.74 billion was 18% above 2019’s fourth-quarter level</td>
      <td>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  reported sharply higher profit for the fourth quarter, punctuating a turbulent year in which the Wall Street firm benefited from the markets’ quick recovery from the worst of the pandemic-induced recession.<br />Goldman on Tuesday reported quarterly profit of $4.51 billion, or $12.08 a share, more than double its level from the same quarter a year ago. Revenue of $11.74 billion was 18% above 2019’s fourth-quarter level. Both measures were much better than the expectations of analysts polled by FactSet, who forecast profit of $7.39 a share on revenue of $9.99 billion.<br />Full-year revenue at Goldman of $44.56 billion was the most since 2009, while annual trading revenue reached a 10-year high.<br />For the U.S. banking industry, 2020 was a roller-coaster year. Markets plunged and economic activity declined in the spring as the coronavirus spread across the country. With many businesses closed and many consumers out of work, banks girded themselves for widespread defaults. A robust federal spending program helped forestall the worst-case economic scenario, and in earnings reports last week, bank executives signaled the economy has held up better than expected.<br />On Friday,  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. said fourth-quarter profit soared 42% to a record $12.14 billion after the bank released $2.9 billion from its stockpile of funds previously set aside to cover soured loans. On Tuesday,  Bank of America Corp.  said profit fell 22% but topped analysts’ expectations after it released $828 million from its loan-loss reserves.</td>

      <td>Fleet of specialist ships needed to build and service offshore wind farms is expected to grow in coming years</td>
      <td>LONDON—After two decades hauling cement and fuel to oil rigs in the North Sea, Atlantic Discovery faced the end of the line in 2015 when energy markets crashed and the ship was dispatched to an Edinburgh scrapyard.<br />Now the vessel is back plying the waves under a new owner. Tricked out with high-lift cranes and an upgraded positioning system, it started servicing the U.K.’s offshore wind farms in 2019.<br />Atlantic Discovery is one of a growing number of vessels catering to offshore wind farms, which are proliferating as the world reduces its reliance on fossil fuels. The need to finance the ships has lured money managers chasing investments that check the environmentally friendly box and provide yield. Their interest suggests appetite for cleaner investments extends beyond the ubiquitous green bonds of recent years.<br />Ships clear the seabed of debris, lay foundations and build turbines—often far from shore in treacherous conditions. A financing gap exists because banks have pulled back from the shipping industry after losses since the 2008-09 financial crisis.<br />Galya Petkova sees this in her job at Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA, leasing vessels to service turbines. She is encountering more private funds that own or finance ships compared with three years ago, she says.</td>

      <td>Gen. Lloyd Austin must show senators he is a qualified military leader—and dedicated to civilian control of the Pentagon</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—When Gen. Lloyd Austin appears before the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday, he will be one of the few members of President-elect Joe Biden’s team with deep military experience to help him confront threats around the world, his advisers said.<br />At the same time, the Army officer with 41 years of military service will have to persuade those same lawmakers he can lead the Pentagon with the perspective of a civilian.<br />The modern Defense Department was designed to have a civilian leader and a team of senior uniformed officers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, advising the president. Because of that, the law requires Gen. Austin, who retired from the U.S. Army in 2016, to receive a waiver from Congress to hold the job of secretary of defense, in addition to winning the Senate confirmation required of most cabinet-level appointees.<br />“Lloyd is very cognizant that he is coming in as a political appointee,” said a person familiar with his preparations for the confirmation hearings. “He knows that he is going to be a civilian, politically appointed official in the Biden cabinet, and he’s comfortable taking on that new role. He has to make it clear he is not a general.”<br />Laws safeguarding civilian control of the military require the top Pentagon civilian job to be held by someone out of uniform for seven years, unless Congress votes to waive the rule. Gen. Austin, 67, would become the second recent Pentagon leader to require a congressional waiver, following retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, who was President Trump’s first defense secretary.</td>

      <td>The investment firm boosted exposure in hot industrial-space category and shifted out of retail and traditional office space</td>
      <td>The pandemic has slammed some of the major property types, but changes that  Blackstone  Group Inc. made to its real-estate portfolio over time have helped the investment firm navigate through the fallout.<br />In the years before Covid-19 hit, Blackstone altered its property mix based on changes taking place in the economy and technologies. While investors at the firm weren’t preparing for a pandemic, their moves to gradually reduce exposure to certain real-estate categories have since served them well.<br />Retail and lodging, for example, have been the two hardest-hit commercial-property types during the pandemic, as travel nosedived and consumers migrated to online shopping with many stores closed or limiting capacity because of Covid-19.<br />In a global real-estate portfolio that Blackstone values at $341 billion, retail real-estate holdings make up only 5% of equity value, down from 19% in 2015, according to the firm. Changes in equity value result both from firm investment decisions and changes in market valuations.<br />Hotels account for 7% of the equity value, down from 23% in 2015. Lodging was nearly half the portfolio’s equity value in 2010, when Blackstone controlled  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.  and owned many lodging properties.</td>

Still, per-share earnings of 59 cents topped analyst estimates of 55 cents a share.<br />Bank of America released $828 million of its reserves. That is a small share of the money it has stowed away to cover bad loans, but a sign that its executives believe there may not be as much consumer and business distress as initially thought. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Citigroup Inc.  also said Friday they were releasing some of their reserves, reflecting an improving economic outlook.<br />The largest banks spent the first part of last year building up reserves to prepare for a wave of loan defaults. While Bank of America processed some 2 million deferrals when the coronavirus pandemic hit, only 77,000 of them were still in place at the end of last year.<br />The Federal Reserve, which had restricted banks’ returns to shareholders last year, told them last month they could once again buy back their own stock, with limits. Bank of America said Tuesday that its board authorized a $2.9 billion repurchase plan for the first quarter.</td>
