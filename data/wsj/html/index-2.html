      <td>BAGHDAD—A fire caused by an exploding oxygen canister killed at least 58 people in a hospital treating Covid-19 patients in southern Iraq late Monday in the second lethal blaze in a coronavirus facility in the country in less than three months, according to Iraqi officials.<br />Videos of the incident reviewed by The Wall Street Journal showed flames and plumes of black smoke along with the sound of sirens at the Al-Hussein hospital in the city of Nasiriyah.<br />The fire began in a quarantine facility for Covid-19 patients attached to the main hospital, according to local health officials. The Iraqi government has ordered an investigation into the cause of the fire, which continued after midnight local time.<br />Following an emergency meeting with ministers and top security officials, Iraq Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi suspended the hospital director, the head of the regional health department and the province’s head of civil defense. He also ordered that all three be detained during the investigation.<br />The fire amplifies the public pressure on Iraq’s government as it deals with crumbling infrastructure, an continuing economic crisis, the coronavirus pandemic and an array of security problems.</td>

      <td>Biden sounds the right notes but there’s more the U.S. can do.</td>
      <td>The remarkable protests in Cuba this weekend show that the Cuban people still yearn for a life free of tyranny despite decades of repression. President Biden hit the right note on Monday by expressing American support for the protesters, and let’s hope he follows through by increasing pressure on the regime.<br />Protests aren’t uncommon in Cuba, where most people live in desperate poverty while a narrow governing elite benefit from a state-owned economy that depends on dollars and euros from abroad. But Sunday’s uprising was unusual it that it developed almost spontaneously and expanded across the island as the message spread on social media and apps like Telegram.<br />The protests weren’t planned or organized. Cubans massed in the streets to register their opposition to the economic fallout from Covid-19, which has been mismanaged on the island; widespread shortages of food and medicine; and the numerous daily blackouts from failing electric power.<br />Protesters picked up the cry of freedom and sang the popular “Patria y Vida” (Homeland and Life) as a way of repudiating Che Guevara’s revolutionary slogan “Homeland or Death.” Social media is dangerous to the dictatorship because it allows people to share their dissatisfaction and feel they aren’t alone.<br />This time is also different because Fidel Castro is dead, his brother Raúl no longer holds an official position, and successor Miguel Díaz-Canel has no claim to legitimacy beyond the military and intelligence services that back him. The public’s willingness to risk arrest by heading into the streets is a signal that their suffering is so great that most Cubans have nothing left to lose.</td>

      <td>Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan didn’t need President Biden’s order on Friday to give more scrutiny to Big Tech acquisitions. She was already on it.<br />Several media outlets reported Friday that the FTC has begun an extended review of Amazon’s proposed $8.5 billion purchase of MGM Studios. Amazon had to file premerger notifications for the deal with the FTC due to its size, but some 95% of mergers are waived through because they pose no threat to competition.<br />Neither does the Amazon-MGM deal, but the FTC has issued Amazon what’s known as a “second request” for information. This signals that the agency is closely scrutinizing an acquisition. What’s there to scrutinize? Competition in media content and streaming is vast. The average U.S. household subscribes to four streaming services.<br />Amazon’s streaming competitors include  Disney +, Netflix, Hulu,  Apple ,  NBC and WarnerMedia (now merging with Discovery). The MGM acquisition will benefit Amazon’s 140 some million U.S. Prime subscribers who will get access to a larger library of content, and it could force other streaming services to improve their own catalogs.<br />As for MGM, production studios have been struggling as people avoid public theaters for their big screens at home. Disney in 2019 acquired 21st Century Fox in part for its giant catalog including the Simpsons and several Marvel franchise films. Amazon has prioritized original programming with niche appeal, but it lags in classics. It also wants to create more value for Prime members since other retailers now offer online deliveries that are as fast and free.</td>

That has become more important and more complicated as companies shift a growing share of their work online, both to reach customers and to connect employees remotely, Microsoft security executive Eric Doerr said in a blog post on Monday about the acquisition.<br />For companies that use cloud computing, “it’s increasingly critical to understand the full scope of their assets to reduce their attack surface,” Mr. Doerr wrote.<br />Microsoft didn’t disclose the deal’s terms. Representatives for Microsoft and RiskIQ didn’t immediately respond to inquiries.<br />Internet vulnerabilities have drawn mounting concern this year as examples proliferate of cyberattacks with wide-ranging effects. In May, the 5,500-mile Colonial Pipeline, crucial to the East Coast’s energy infrastructure, was temporarily shut down by its operator after a cyberattack, leading to gasoline shortages in some places.</td>

      <td>He could inadvertently strengthen the separation of powers.</td>
      <td>The Biden Administration may be the most progressive in decades, but it is accelerating a conservative revolution in presidential power over the federal bureaucracy. The latest example is the President’s sacking Friday of Social Security Administration (SSA) commissioner Andrew Saul, the Trump appointee whose six-year term wouldn’t have expired until 2025.<br />Democrats in Congress lobbied for Mr. Saul’s firing because he displeased federal employee unions. Mr. Biden has been aggressive in purging the federal government of Trump appointees, even those like the SSA commissioner who typically serve under Presidents of both parties. The Administration has also broken norms by axing the National Labor Relations Board general counsel and leaders at the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts and the Administrative Conference of the U.S.<br />In a legal memo justifying the firing of Mr. Saul, the Biden White House pointed to the Supreme Court’s decisions in Seila Law v. CFPB (2020), which held that the President could fire the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Collins v. Yellen (2021) which held that he can fire the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.<br />Those decisions were a major blow to the favored progressive model of governance, which sees agencies insulated from accountability as preferable to traditional democratic processes. Mr. Biden’s nominee to lead the CFPB, Rohit Chopra, in 2018 proposed a new agency to regulate political lobbying headed by a virtually unremovable director with a term of up to 10 years.<br />Yet Democrats are now adopting the conservative view that a President ought to be able to exert greater control over executive agencies. This shift comes from partisanship, not principle, but it could have lasting implications.</td>

      <td>It’s election season in Virginia, where Republicans have been hemorrhaging support for more than a decade but have a shot at winning the governorship in November. What’s the state GOP up to? Tattling to the University of Virginia about a liberal professor’s anti-Donald Trump tweets.<br />Last Thursday the Virginia Republican Party chairman sent a letter to the state university’s president declaring that “Dr. Larry J. Sabato, founder and director of UVa’s Center for Politics, has been engaging in behavior that appears to violate UVa’s Mission Statement, the Center for Politics Mission Statement, and UVa’s Code of Ethics for Faculty and Staff.”<br />The letter lists eight tweets Mr. Sabato sent over the last year—mostly typical Democratic invective, such as, “Trump, who governed on the edge of insanity for four long years, has gone over the edge. Yet millions of people and 90%+ of GOP members of Congress, still genuflect before this false god.”<br />The Virginia GOP wants an “investigation” into whether Mr. Sabato’s “public display of bitter partisanship” broke the rules. But public university administrators, as state actors, can’t lawfully punish students or faculty for First Amendment expression.<br />Some conservatives want to deploy progressive silencing tactics for their own ends. Good luck achieving that in the liberal university. Inviting bureaucrats to exercise more control over political speech on campus will further cement liberal dominance.</td>

      <td>Maki Inada has to drive 5½ hours to see a doctor because of state laws restricting telemedicine.</td>
      <td>Maki Inada is juggling a lot these days. She’s a biology professor at upstate New York’s Ithaca College, where she balances teaching and research on messenger RNA (suddenly a topic of global interest). She is a mother of a vivacious 10-year-old who just finished fourth grade, and that means lots of driving back and forth to gymnastics and swimming practice. And she has lung cancer. In April, after years of clean scans, the cancer was back. She just had major surgery and is starting chemotherapy again. She has a lot of appointments with her local oncologist and her oncology team at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.<br />One silver lining of the pandemic for Ms. Inada was that she didn’t have to drive to Boston for her appointments. She began having video calls with her doctors and planned to conduct many of her postoperative and oncology appointments via telemedicine. But regulatory changes in the past month have thrown a wrench in those plans. Dana-Farber told Ms. Inada she’ll have to be physically located in Massachusetts for a visit. She doesn’t have to go all the way to the doctor’s office, a 5½-hour drive each way. She can drive 3½ hours, cross the border into Massachusetts, pull over, and have a telemedicine visit in the car.<br />So for her next appointment, the grandparents drove 11 hours to Ithaca to watch their granddaughter, and Ms. Inada and her husband drove to Boston. After she had some scans at the cancer hospital, she quickly had a telemedicine visit from the lobby. But she had to skip one of her postoperative appointments because you can only drive back and forth so many times.<br />This sudden, severe and senseless inconvenience results from one of the historical vestiges of U.S. healthcare. The practice of medicine is regulated by state medical boards, which can license doctors only to practice medicine in their state. Traditionally, medicine is “practiced” where the patient is located. If Ms. Inada is in New York during an appointment, then her physician must be licensed in New York even if he is somewhere else.<br />Early in the pandemic, most states relaxed the rules and allowed out-of-state providers to provide care to patients in their state. These temporary waivers allowed Ms. Inada to have telemedicine visits at home in New York with her doctors in Massachusetts. But as these temporary waivers began to lapse, Dana-Farber changed its policy. It’s too expensive and complicated for the cancer center to have all its physicians licensed in every state.</td>

      <td>Progressive education consultants and activists stand to pocket millions from the implementation of a new curriculum.</td>
      <td>High-school students in California could soon be required to take at least one semester of something called “ethnic studies” to graduate. The California Senate Education Committee holds hearings this week on Assembly Bill 101, which passed the lower house 58-9 in May. If A.B. 101 becomes law, it will line the pockets of a waiting diversity industry with hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer funds, as well as federal coronavirus relief money.<br />In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Congress passed the Cares Act in March 2020. The legislation provided $2.2 trillion of financial assistance to individuals, businesses and state institutions. Of that $2.2 trillion, $16.2 billion was set aside for primary and secondary education. The California Education Department received $2 billion.<br />These funds were intended to cover a variety of difficulties caused by pandemic-related budget shortfalls. The U.S. Department of Education recommended that the money be used to prevent teacher layoffs, preserve mental-health programs, and improve school ventilation. But the feds also urged state education departments to use the money to “advance equity” given the “disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on communities of color.” This opened the door for California to spend its federal windfall in a way that most Americans would likely find reprehensible.<br />Sacramento lawmakers passed a bill in 2016 requiring the state Board of Education to create a model curriculum in ethnic studies and recommend that each district make the curriculum required learning for grades 9-12 beginning in the 2021-22 school year. The first draft of the ethnic studies model curriculum, or ESMC, provoked a public outcry when it was published in August 2019. While the bill stipulated that the model curriculum should prepare students to appreciate the contributions of all cultures, it contained significant anti-Semitic sentiment, such as a poem insinuating that Jews control the media. The proposed curriculum even went so far as to endorse the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, an anti-Israel lobby.<br />The state Board of Education produced a new version of the model curriculum. It removed the outright anti-Semitism, but added explicit references to critical race theory and neo-Marxism. The introduction of the new curriculum states that ethnic studies is “housed in the conceptual model of the ‘double helix’ which interweaves holistic humanization and critical consciousness.” In a footnote, the idea of “holistic humanization” is tied to the work of Tara J. Yosso, a widely cited critical race theorist. “Critical consciousness” refers to Paulo Freire’s theory that people must become aware and critical of oppressors (mainly white males) to bring about a Marxist revolution.</td>

      <td>A mix of ruthless repression and shrewd opportunism makes the regime resilient.</td>
      <td>As protests erupted across Cuba last weekend, the country faced its severest test since the fall of the Soviet Union. But the system Fidel Castro founded is resilient, and those in charge are determined. Caught off guard initially by the protests, authorities responded quickly and forcefully, cutting off internet service and supplementing police forces with violent groups of regime supporters to shut down the fast-spreading protests.<br />Many observers expected the regime to disintegrate in the 1990s when the Soviet collapse left the island politically isolated and cut off from the subsidies that had kept its struggling economy afloat. Widespread food and energy shortages marked what Castro called the “special period,” but a mix of ruthless repression and shrewd opportunism kept the Communist Party in power.<br />Castro found new sources of revenue to replace the Soviet Union. Tourism brought foreign currency from Europeans and Canadians seeking sun and sex. Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela provided energy in exchange for Cuban political and military assistance. Havana rented out its medical personnel overseas, with the government being paid directly for their services and providing the conscripted health workers with only a pittance. And Castro cynically weaponized the family ties between Cuban-Americans and their on-island relatives. Allowing Cuban-Americans to visit the island and to send money to their suffering family members brought desperately needed dollars into Cuba—and the government set up a network of dollar-only stores selling scarce goods at high prices to capture this revenue for itself.<br />Castro always regarded market forces with suspicion and, despite advice from Beijing, chose not to follow the Chinese or Vietnamese model. He did, however, introduce carefully limited market reforms when times were especially difficult, rolling them back when conditions improved.<br />He also manipulated the flow of resources to reinforce the regime. Havana wouldn’t permit an independent business sector on the island, and foreign investors were carefully monitored. No single investor, corporate or individual, was allowed to accumulate enough assets to pose any kind of political threat to the power structure. Raúl Castro, at the head of the armed forces, ensured that loyal officers were the chief beneficiaries of the burgeoning tourism industry, and either the army, the state or the Communist Party was the privileged partner in joint ventures with foreign investors.</td>

      <td>America’s top public high school shows us what discrimination looks like today.</td>
      <td>When Jeannie C. Riley released “Harper Valley P.T.A.” in 1968, her hit single mocked a parent-teacher association for telling a school mom she was wearing her dresses way too high. Today the real-life sequel is playing out at the Virginia Parent Teacher Association and its chapter at a high-performing public school in Fairfax County. This time, however, parents are complaining about the PTA—that it’s in cahoots with those watering down entrance standards with the aim of reducing the school’s Asian-American population.<br />Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology is a school for gifted students ranked No. 1 among all public high schools nationwide by U.S. News & World Report. In December the county school board changed its admissions process, replacing a rigorous, race-blind entrance exam with a “holistic” (read: subjective) formula that includes grades but also puts caps on the number of students each middle school could send to TJ—a de facto limit on middle schools with high numbers of Asian-American students.<br />The desired result has been achieved. The percentage of Asian-Americans admitted to TJ dropped to 54% this year from 73% last year. Whites, blacks and Latinos all saw their numbers go up. No doubt this is only the beginning.<br />In March, a group of concerned parents called the Coalition for TJ sued, claiming the new policy violates equal-protection rights guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. In May they won a victory when a federal judge refused to dismiss their lawsuit. “Everyone knows the policy is not race-neutral, and that it’s designed to affect the racial composition of the school,” Judge Claude Hilton said. “You can say all sorts of beautiful things while you’re doing others.”<br />This was quickly followed in early June by the election of four of the coalition’s parents to the local PTA’s seven-member executive board. Incredibly, the Virginia state PTA responded by trying to dissolve the TJ chapter—on preposterous charges including the claim that the victorious candidates have created “a climate that discourages parental involvement.”</td>

      <td>Testosterone exists in both sexes, but in very different concentrations. Its effects on mind and body are still being mapped.</td>
      <td>In the late 1990s Carole Hooven, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, was researching chimpanzee hormone levels in Uganda when she observed that Imoso, the troop’s “mayor,” let loose on females, particularly Outamba, kicking and drubbing her with his fists until she bled. Although primatologists had long documented bellicosity in chimps, our closest cousins, Ms. Hooven was still shocked, kindling a desire to plumb the organic underpinnings of this behavior.<br />In her clear-eyed, crisply written “T: The Story of Testosterone, the Hormone That Dominates and Divides Us,” Ms. Hooven does that, and so much more. In the intervening decades the ground has shifted: the Human Genome Project compiled our vast DNA alphabet, the Supreme Court federalized same-sex marriage, and victims of sexual assault, in a crescendo of rage and shame, forced a public reckoning. She deftly threads the needle of social ferment with her own imperatives as a scientist, exploring the “molecule of masculinity,” coded by SRY, a runt of a gene found on the Y chromosome, but one that packs a wallop.<br />“T” does what all superb popular science must do: It entertains as it educates. Ms. Hooven depicts endocrinology’s origin in the 19th century, when Arnold Berthold, a German academic, sewed testes into the abdomens of castrated cockerels. The physiologist Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard went a step further, injecting himself with the extracts of crushed testes harvested from guinea pigs and dogs. Ms. Hooven also weaves in other historical figures, among them the eunuchs of China’s Qing dynasty and the castrati of Baroque Italian choirs.<br />The discovery of testosterone in the early 20th century brings the narrative into a sharper scientific focus. Ms. Hooven surveys the data on T, distilled from a broad literature—for example, the hormone exists in both sexes but is 10 to 20 times greater in men. She conveys her arguments in folksy metaphors, comparing gene action in fetal development to a recipe for chocolate-chip cookies: “The gene for Jenny’s androgen receptor had a tiny typo, but the results were more consequential than misprinting ‘three eggs.’ It’s as if ‘two cups flour’ were misspelled ‘two cups fluor.’ Fluor is a mineral containing the element fluorine, and is worse than useless for baking.”<br />“T” roams widely, as Ms. Hooven details the rutting rituals of red deer on Rum, a craggy island off the coast of Scotland. High-T stags triumph in the clash of antlers, passing along their genes. By contrast Ms. Hooven delves into the career of the serendipitously named John Wingfield, a British biologist who studied song sparrows. These birds’ testosterone spikes as they woo females with their warbles; after the brood hatches, the fathers are involved in the care of their chicks, dialing down their T. When Wingfield increased testosterone in a group of males that had been busy gathering food for the nest, the results were dramatic. “High-T dads went out singing at all hours along the perimeter of their territories, telling the neighbors to screw off and trying to score new females.” Chicks fathered by these hormonally revived playboys were more likely to starve.</td>

      <td>AUSTIN, Texas—Dozens of state House Democrats fled Texas on Monday to deny the Republican-controlled state legislature the quorum necessary to pass voting legislation during a special session.<br />Democratic House members said they were boarding chartered airplanes bound for Washington, D.C., where they hope to draw national support for their fight against the bills. At least 59 of the body’s 67 Democrats were expected to participate in the walkout, according to a source familiar with the plans, but the final number may not be known until the House is called to order Tuesday morning.<br />The legislators will have to remain out of state for weeks to avoid voting during the 30-day legislative session, which Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called after a previous walkout by Democrats shortly before a voting deadline killed the legislation at the end of the body’s regular session in May.<br />The bill that was considered in May would have set some of the nation’s broadest restrictions on voting. Mr. Abbott called the legislation a matter of election security, and an emergency. Democrats say the legislation is aimed at preventing their supporters, including many minority group members, from voting.<br />After Democrats killed the vote by staging a walkout this spring, Mr. Abbott called the special session for a legislature that typically meets for only five months every other year.</td>

      <td>There’s much Beltway and media chatter that President Joe Biden’s regulatory agenda threatens Big Business and in particular Big Tech. But history suggests otherwise. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the publication of George Stigler’s essay “The Theory of Economic Regulation” in the Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science. After investigating various markets, the University of Chicago economist  reported that “as a rule, regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit.” As Stigler described the phenomenon of regulatory capture, the future Nobel Prize winner understood that complex and expensive rules are often easier to navigate for market giants than for their upstart competitors. Free and open markets, on the other hand, present fewer barriers to those wishing to challenge incumbents.<br />Stigler also knew that many of his fellow academics would not easily abandon their idealistic view of government regulation. He once noted that “the economic role of the state has managed to hold the attention of scholars for over two centuries without arousing their curiosity.”<br />For anyone who really is curious about which tech giants will benefit most from the Biden era, Eriq Gardner of the Hollywood Reporter makes a compelling case for  Netflix .<br />Before we get to the details on why this may be Silicon Valley’s most politically favored company, let’s review a few of the provisions of President Joe Biden’s new effort to regulate various U.S. industries.<br />“The heart of American capitalism is a simple idea: open and fair competition,” said the president on Friday, before signing an executive order instructing government agencies to undertake no fewer than 72 specific interventions into American markets. Given this ambitious  regulatory agenda some readers may wonder what exactly he meant by “open” competition and perhaps even Mr. Biden isn’t exactly sure, but his Friday comments suggested, among other things, that business combinations will be much harder to execute in the United States:</td>

Ms. Mac Donald cites Brookings Institution research that itself recognizes the impacts of structural racism. It views “homework as an outcome of the culture of the school and the expectations of teachers, rather than an outcome of a student’s effort” and time spent studying.<br />National scientific leaders have a responsibility to ask why disparities exist and to propose solutions that will lead to better science. We’re losing out on the contributions of those who haven’t had an equal opportunity to develop their talents. Diversity leads to good science. We’ve known this for years. In a 2004 study, Lu Hong and Scott Page produced a framework for modeling how functionally diverse groups explore broader solutions and arrive at better answers to complex problems. In medicine, the exclusion of women and minorities from research teams has exacerbated U.S. healthcare disparities.<br />America’s diversity is a competitive advantage.

Are the other 129 countries in agreement because they think that what is best for America is best for the world? Individuals and corporations continue to move within the U.S. in pursuit of lower state and local tax rates. Should there be a minimum corporate tax rate for all 50 U.S. states? Global tax collusion also suggests that multinational cartels such as OPEC were ahead of their time in maximizing member-nation revenues through agreements on prices and production levels. The race to the top gives governments more revenue and power at the expense of the private sector.<br />Not long ago, it would have been uncompetitive European welfare states coaxing other countries to raise their corporate tax rates so that Europe could continue to milk the private sector without fear of corporate cows leaving. Now it is the U.S. that needs to end the tax race to the bottom, so that Washington can grow without losing business to other countries. A higher corporate tax rate, like any other cost, is passed through to customers, but it is buried in prices for goods and services and therefore represents a stealth personal tax.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who is expected to meet with the committee’s Democrats early this week, said he hopes to pass a budget resolution setting its parameters before the chamber departs for its August break.<br />“The discussions have been going almost around the clock,” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), also a member of the Budget Committee, said in an interview Monday. When he was in Oregon over the break, with fires and intense heat sweeping the state, “everybody wants to know what’s going to be done about it,” he said. “There are a lot of issues to resolve.”<br />If Democrats can remain united, that would allow them to pass legislation with just a simple majority in the 50-50 Senate, rather than the 60-votes threshold most bills face. But more centrist and liberal Democrats are still divided over the size of the budget package, as well as how much of it should be paid for by other revenue, including tax increases.<br />After a weekend of discussions, lawmakers hadn’t yet settled on an overall price tag, although some aides expected them to begin discussion on a package roughly $3 trillion to $4 trillion in size. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) hasn’t yet agreed to scale back his hopes for a $6 trillion package, according to someone familiar with the discussions. But Democrats can’t afford to lose a single vote from their own ranks, and moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) has said he hopes to stay closer to $2 trillion.</td>

I don’t believe he’ll have the luxury of letting itself play out without his intervention,” said Fernand Amandi, a Miami-based Democratic pollster.<br />As protests continued Monday, Mr. Biden said: “The United States stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights. And we call on the government of Cuba to refrain from violence in their attempt to silence the voices of the people.” He added he would have more to say this week.<br />The president’s foreign policy agenda thus far has been consumed with countering China and Russia and re-engaging European allies. Former President Donald Trump’s gains among Cuban-American voters in Florida in 2020 have demonstrated the domestic political peril of outreach to Havana, political analysts say.</td>

      <td>Plaintiffs allege billionaire entrepreneur led Tesla to overpay for the home-solar company in 2016</td>
      <td>WILMINGTON, Del.— Tesla Inc.  Chief Executive Elon Musk was in court Monday to defend the company’s purchase of SolarCity Corp., telling a judge that he didn’t act improperly during the negotiating process and doesn’t even enjoy running the electric-vehicle maker.<br />The case dates to 2016, when Mr. Musk was chairman of both the then-unprofitable companies. His solution to improve their outlook: Combine them in a roughly $2.1 billion tie-up to establish a single clean-energy business. Plaintiffs, which include several pension funds that owned Tesla stock, have characterized the deal as a scheme to benefit himself and bail out a home-solar company on the verge of insolvency.<br />Mr. Musk was the opening witness called in Delaware Chancery Court in a nonjury trial that is expected to run about two weeks. The attorneys for Mr. Musk have framed the acquisition as an opportunity to realize his long-held goal of creating a vertically integrated sustainable energy company.<br />A primary question in the case is whether Mr. Musk, who owned roughly 22% of Tesla at the time, controlled the transaction. Proving that claim is a challenge because Mr. Musk was a minority shareholder of Tesla and the company’s shareholders approved the acquisition. Lawyers for Mr. Musk have said that SolarCity was worth more than Tesla paid for it and the electric-vehicle maker’s board members, who included Mr. Musk’s brother, Kimbal Musk, acted independently.<br />Despite the absence of a jury, the billionaire CEO, who has a record of sometimes blunt and surprising statements, flashed some of that in this case. He said during the trial he didn’t enjoy being the boss of Tesla. “I rather hate it and I would much prefer to spend my time on design and engineering, which is what intrinsically I like doing,” he said.</td>

      <td>At least 10 people have died in violence that followed Jacob Zuma’s detention</td>
      <td>JOHANNESBURG—South Africa deployed its army Monday to help quell violent protests and widespread looting following the arrest of former President Jacob Zuma, as his lawyers sought to convince the country’s highest court that it had erred in convicting the former antiapartheid campaigner for contempt of court.<br />Hundreds of angry residents ransacked shops and malls, torched cars and blocked major roads, bringing public transport to a near standstill in Mr. Zuma’s home province of KwaZulu-Natal and the economic capital, Johannesburg. Others, many armed with sticks, marched through downtown Johannesburg and the city of Durban. There were reports of live bullets being fired at police.<br />Last month, South Africa’s Constitutional Court sentenced the former president—who resigned in 2018 under pressure from his own African National Congress—to 15 months in prison after he refused to testify at a government-mandated commission investigating allegations of widespread corruption during his nine years in power. He was arrested on Wednesday after failing to hand himself in to the police within the mandated three days.<br />While the initial reaction to Mr. Zuma’s arrest was muted, protests grew in KwaZulu-Natal over the weekend before turning increasingly violent and spreading to Johannesburg on Sunday. By Monday evening, at least 10 people had been killed, including a security guard, and police had arrested nearly 500 others.<br />“Over the past few days and nights, there have been acts of public violence of a kind rarely seen in the history of our democracy,” President Cyril Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma’s successor, said in an address to the nation, reading out the names of those who died in the unrest. As television stations broadcast the president’s speech, some carried split screens showing the continuing looting outside.</td>

      <td><br />Los Angeles<br />About 4,500 years ago, an image of the Sumerian storm god Ningirsu was engraved on a silver vessel now on view in the Getty Villa Museum exhibition “Mesopotamia: Civilization Begins.”<br />He is, we see, a lion-headed eagle, a master of the wild, grasping lions and ibexes in his curled claws. The vessel—known as the “Vase of Enmetena,” after a king of that period—was apparently filled with an offering meant to pacify Ningirsu. I would have provided a second helping.<br />Greek gods could be petty and jealous. But this region’s gods, who came into being much earlier, and reigned in various incarnations over the lands between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, are more like brute animals than flawed humans. The demon Pazuzu, associated, the exhibition tells us, with “the ill winds that brought plague and other maladies,” appears here as a horrifying bronze statuette (934-610 B.C.); he possesses raptor talons, a scorpion’s tail and a head combining a dog and lion. “I have scaled the powerful mountains,” reads his cuneiform inscription. “They trembled.”</td>

      <td>Street demonstrations come as the country’s economic crisis and the pandemic lead to deteriorating living conditions and shortages</td>
      <td>Cuban citizens have taken to the streets across the country for the first time in more than six decades to protest against deteriorating living conditions and the lack of basic goods and services, including medical attention amid increasing numbers of coronavirus infections.<br />The protests, with thousands of people calling for an end to the 62-year-old communist regime, began Sunday in the western city of San Antonio de los Baños, later spreading to more than 40 cities and towns including the capital Havana. President Miguel Díaz-Canel responded by calling on supporters to take back the streets from the protesters and deploying security forces across the country.<br />In Havana, state forces were out in droves Sunday night, including so-called rapid-reaction brigades and Communist Party militants armed with heavy sticks. Some protesters were attacked, and at least 80 have been arrested, according to activists.<br />The latest wave of hardship for the Cuban people comes after the economy contracted more than 11% last year amid the pandemic, which led tourism to dry up and brought about a drop in remittances from Cubans living abroad—both vital sources of income for families.<br />Cubans stand for hours in line to buy basic goods such as chicken or bread, or even to take a bus. The island is increasingly hit by hourslong electricity outages, and, in recent days, coronavirus infections have surged, according to authorities, putting a strain on the country’s health system.</td>

      <td>Match Group may always shine bright in online dating, but right now Bumble has some appeal</td>
      <td>In the 2001 biographical drama “A Beautiful Mind,” schizophrenic genius John Nash wasn’t much of a charmer with the ladies. But when it came to probability, he was a master. His advice to boost your chances at finding love? Ignore the most beautiful person in the room.<br />Now might be a good time to apply that logic to stock picking. All signs point to a strong quarter coming up for dating-app companies. But the market hasn’t treated them equally. Online-dating giant  Match Group  is up 62% over the past year, while smaller player  Bumble  has shed 25% since its February initial public offering. Bumble is now trading at just 9.4 times enterprise value to forward sales, with Match at a significant premium at 14.6 times. Heading into earnings, investors might want to take a page from Mr. Nash’s book.<br />There is a reason Match has outperformed. It not only owns the top grossing dating app in the world in Tinder, but seven of the top 10 dating apps by consumer spending in the U.S. as of the first quarter, according to data from Sensor Tower. Bumble’s namesake app may be the No. 2 dating app in the world, but its other app, Badoo, is much less popular.<br />That balance of power isn’t likely to shift in Bumble’s favor any time soon. Despite its mission to empower women to make the first move, a recent survey from Evercore ISI found a higher percentage of women say they are using Tinder than Bumble. It also found that of males and females using both apps, a significantly higher percentage of both groups reported being more satisfied with Tinder. Meanwhile, Match’s relationship app Hinge continues to gain traction. Morgan Stanley analyst Lauren Schenk notes that Hinge could surpass Bumble in terms of monthly active users in the next 18 to 24 months if current growth rates hold.<br />In the near term, though, both Bumble and Match are likely to be beneficiaries of a waning pandemic and consumers’ pent-up desire to connect. Between the two, Bumble’s underperformance this year leaves more room for upside.</td>

Their release comes more than two years after a Chinese researcher triggered international outrage when he revealed that he had used Crispr to produce the first gene-edited babies.<br />The committee, made up of ethicists, policy makers and lawyers, said in the reports that the use of gene editing had evolved dramatically since they set out in December 2018 to develop a governing framework and that recent successes in altering the DNA of people with lethal diseases had opened up ethical challenges.<br />The reports described several scenarios that the proposed strategies might help prevent, including conducting gene-editing trials in low-income countries to develop therapies that would ultimately be too costly for all but the wealthiest ones to buy; unscrupulous clinics offering unsafe or ineffective gene-editing services to people desperate to overcome potentially life-threatening conditions; and the use of gene editing for enhancing traits such as athletic ability.<br />“We want people to look at what is happening now and what we need to do to shape the way the research will proceed,” said committee member Françoise Baylis, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, and an expert on the ethics of human gene editing.</td>

      <td>His new competition policy is a power grab that will hurt economic growth and investment.</td>
      <td>‘Forty years ago, we chose the wrong path,” President Biden told Americans on Friday, “following the misguided philosophy of people like Robert Bork, and pulled back on enforcing laws to promote competition.”<br />What was that path, exactly? And where have these 40 years in the wilderness led us?<br />These aren’t academic questions for me. I remember my father in the late 1960s working in his cramped attic study in New Haven, Conn., beginning to develop his theory of antitrust law. He was 40, sitting at a desk my mother made from an old door, scribbling with his Scripto mechanical pencil on yellow legal pads, wreathed by a cloud of smoke from the Kent cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth.<br />My father taught himself calculus because he believed a specialist in antitrust should understand the complexities of price theory. The product of this decadelong labor and his rigorous study of antitrust was his 1978 masterpiece, “The Antitrust Paradox: A Policy at War with Itself.” By paradox, he meant that laws designed to protect consumers ended up protecting everyone but consumers.<br />Earlier in the century, Justice Louis Brandeis had denounced the “curse of bigness” against “small dealers and worthy men.” He thought the law should protect small firms against the predations of larger, more efficient ones. Justice William O. Douglas took up this cudgel in the 1960s and ’70s, thwacking businesses for being too successful. The conclusion of my father’s work was the profound declaration that antitrust law shouldn’t try to decide who is “worthy” or to defend smaller or less efficient competitors. The sole aim of antitrust law is to protect consumers.</td>

The Shenzhen-based electronics giant had demanded that the American cellphone carrier pay it fees for the use of dozens of patents. Verizon has previously called the allegations meritless.<br />“Verizon is happy with the settlement reached with Huawei involving patent lawsuits,” the U.S. company said Monday. “While terms of the settlement are not being disclosed, our team did an outstanding job bringing this protracted matter to a close.”<br />A Huawei spokesman confirmed the settlement ended litigation between the two companies. News of the settlement was earlier reported by Reuters.<br />Huawei is the world’s largest maker of equipment that forms the backbone of the modern internet as well as a large manufacturer of mobile phones and other consumer electronics. The company has become a flashpoint in a geopolitical fight between the U.S. and China over leadership in technologies considered important to both superpowers’ economic clout.</td>

The plan had initially been to ditch almost all restrictions in June—but Delta meant a four-week delay. Mr. Johnson, who previously talked up the government’s steady easing strategy as “a one-way road to freedom,” warned Britons on Monday that he couldn’t rule out reimposing restrictions in the future.<br />“We want people to remember that this thing, this pandemic, is not over.

      <td>The pandemic has pushed global government debt to the highest level since World War II, surpassing the world’s annual economic output. Governments, especially in rich countries, are borrowing still more, partly to erase the damage of Covid-19.<br />Advocates say the spending, also encouraged by new economic thinking about debt, could usher in a period of robust global growth, reversing the malaise many wealthy countries have felt this century. But if those theories are off-base, the world could be saddled with debts that can be absorbed only via inflation, high taxes or even default.<br />Either way, the combination of huge debt and markets’ lack of concern is unprecedented. The U.S. government is on course for a budget deficit of $3 trillion for the second year in a row. Despite that and fears of inflation, 10-year Treasury bonds are yielding only around 1.33%, partly because of the Federal Reserve’s caution about raising its interest rates.<br />Japan’s central-government debt is about to surpass a quadrillion yen, or nearly $10 trillion. Even with total public debt of over 250% of gross domestic product, Tokyo spends no more on interest each year than it did in the mid-1980s, when public debt was around two-thirds of GDP.<br />Perennial debt champion Greece is adding to its pile, and investors are accepting even lower yields on its bonds than on U.S. Treasurys. Even some developing nations, such as India, are touting the virtues of higher government borrowing, with no discernible backlash from markets.</td>

If you’re the one leaning into flexibility, how do you make sure you’re not unintentionally leaning out of your career?

You’re choosing not to be here.”<br />Many of us have been dutifully plugging away from home, trading time in transit for longer work hours, office coffee breaks for boosted productivity.<br />But the boss might not see it that way. Managers consistently label in-office workers higher performers and give them bigger raises and promotions, Mr. Kropp says, even though data shows there’s really no difference between the two groups.

      <td>The Biden administration wants 80% of U.S. power to come from clean sources. Three experts discuss whether that’s doable—and if so, how.</td>
      <td>Growth in clean energy is accelerating, both in the U.S. and abroad.<br />Last year, the world added a record of more than 260 gigawatts of renewable-electricity capacity, almost 50% more than in 2019, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The U.S. was one of the biggest growth markets, the agency said, adding 29 gigawatts of capacity, almost 80% more than the year before.<br />The U.S. now generates almost 20% of its electricity from renewable sources such as wind, solar and hydropower, while nuclear accounts for another roughly 20%. The Biden administration, which is targeting at least a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, wants Congress to pass its clean-electricity standard, which calls for 80% of U.S. power to come from clean sources by the end of the decade. To that end, the White House’s infrastructure proposal included billions of dollars of investment in renewable energy.<br />Can renewable energy get that big in the U.S. over the next decade? We asked three experts to weigh in: Kevin Book, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners in Washington, D.C.; Jesse Jenkins, assistant professor at Princeton University with a joint appointment in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and Environment; and Leah Stokes, assistant professor of political science at University of California, Santa Barbara.<br />Here are edited excerpts of the discussion:</td>

      <td>When the Fed signals it will taper bond buying, yields drop. If this sounds counterintuitive, don’t worry.</td>
      <td>Perhaps the big drop in Treasury yields over the past three months is really a modern version of the taper tantrum.<br />That probably sounds odd, since back in 2013 the taper tantrum—a bond-market panic about the Federal Reserve cutting its Treasury purchases—prompted the exact opposite reaction, and 10-year yields soared from 1.6% in May of that year to above 3% by the end of December.<br />But bear with me: What happened when the taper actually began was that yields dropped back, eventually falling all the way down to 1.6% again.<br />So here is a possibility: Investors have learned their lesson. The Fed is again readying the markets for the tapering of its bond purchases, but instead of a repeat of 2013’s tantrum, there has been a rush to buy bonds, and a big drop in yields.<br />If this sounds counterintuitive, don’t worry: Bond markets are weird. At its most basic, the 10-year yield is a measure of where investors think the Fed will set rates over the next 10 years, plus or minus an amount to reflect the risk of being wrong. The Fed buying bonds helps to reduce that risk premium, and so should, at least in the Fed’s theory, reduce yields, all else being equal. Tapering, therefore, should increase them.</td>

      <td>Heliogen addresses a lot of problems that concentrated solar power has had. It will still be hard for it to overtake photovoltaic solar.</td>
      <td>Photovoltaic technology has been the clear winner of the solar energy race. Can concentrated solar power catch up?<br />One company seems to think it could be possible. Heliogen, a concentrated solar power company with backing from Bill Gates, announced last week that it will merge with a special-purpose acquisition company in a deal that values the company at an enterprise value of about $2 billion.<br />At first glance, the deal looks like a head-scratcher. Photovoltaic technology, which uses panels to convert light directly into electricity, is miles ahead of CSP, which uses mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlight into very high heat, which is then used to produce steam, electricity or hydrogen. The heat is often stored in a medium that is unlikely to cool off quickly, such as molten salt or rocks (in the case of Heliogen). PV is cheaper, takes up less space and has generally had fewer performance issues. As of 2019, there was just 6.9 Gigawatts of CSP capacity globally, which was roughly 1% of total installed solar capacity, according to data from BloombergNEF, which has since stopped publishing regular updates on the sector because there is little to report on.<br />CSP’s built-in storage capacity was once seen as a promising solution to the intermittence that plagues renewable energy. But the technology has been tough to master and cost is still a large hurdle. Back in 2008, both PV and CSP had a levelized cost of electricity around $450 per megawatt-hour, according to Pietro Radoia, senior analyst at BloombergNEF. Today, PV solar can be as cheap as $29 per MWh without subsidies, while the cheapest CSP solar with storage is more than four times as expensive, according to Lazard’s analysis from 2020. In a 2019 report, BloombergNEF concluded that in the long term, PV paired with batteries is likely to be “only slightly more expensive” and “much less risky” compared with CSP systems.<br />Heliogen costs less than $50 per MWh including the federal investment tax credit, according to its investor deck, which would make it more expensive than unsubsidized utility-scale solar but cheaper than industrial-scale PV solar without subsidies. The main difference, according to Bill Gross, Heliogen’s founder and chief executive officer, is that the company uses cameras on towers to monitor mirrors in real time, with data crunched at 30 frames a second to make sure each mirror’s reflection is hitting the target correctly. The company’s bet is that its technology will get even better over time so that the cost declines will also come from having to use less material per mirror. “Any scarce commodity goes up in price. [The price of] computation only ever goes down,” he said.</td>

      <td>Some people collect rare Nikes, but for the sort of cycling fans who fixate on the Tour de France, nothing is more desirable than an Eddy Merckx jersey or an outlandish Rapha zip-up</td>
      <td>FOR SEVERAL WEEKS, jaunty, skintight cycling jerseys for companies like Maglia Rosa have hung in the window of New York’s Susan Inglett Gallery. The kinetic uniforms are part of “Re: Bicycling,” a month-long exhibition which also includes cycling-inspired artwork by rarefied artists such as Claes Oldenburg, Joseph Beuys and Louise Lawler. Considering the company the stretchy jerseys are keeping, the collector who loaned them out isn’t so sure they belong. “I don’t know if they function that well as art,” said Alex Ostroy, who also co-owns Ostroy, a 3-year-old New York bike-gear company.<br />He’s selling the jerseys short. Cycling uniforms—those slinky, logo-plastered, lurid-colored zip-ups—can be as arresting as blue-chip canvases. Mr. Ostroy, who’s long considered jerseys a covetable asset and hoarded them by the hundreds, noted that huge numbers of passersby are stopping and assessing the jerseys each day, at least according to the gallery.<br />That wouldn’t surprise hardcore cycling fans. Around the world, but especially in cycling-obsessed nations like Belgium and France, peloton aficionados amass jerseys not to wear, but to display like paintings or treasure as keepsakes, triggering misty-eyed memories of watching their first race.<br />Jasper De Deyne, 33, a business coach and rabid cyclist in Antwerp, Belgium, owns over 500 cycling jerseys that he mostly acquired online, yet he said his collection isn’t even the biggest in Belgium, let alone the world. Through the collecting community he has met “a couple of older guys who are not internet-minded” with collections that dwarf his.<br />These collectors could be sitting on gold. Oliver Knight, 43, a photographer based in Paris who published “The Cycling Jersey - Craftsmanship, Speed & Style” in 2017, noted that as recently as three years ago, you could go into a vintage store or scour  eBay  and find a sought-after jersey for as low as $20 or so. He would know: At a Paris vintage store in 2017, Mr. Knight scored an uber-rare 1972 jersey worn by Bic teamrider Roland Berland for €20. Now, he said, “it’s getting harder and harder because people have actually realized the value of them.”</td>

      <td>Unexpected shift in monetary policy is raising questions on strength of China’s rebound</td>
      <td>China just trimmed the reserve requirement ratio for banks—one of its major monetary policy instruments—for the first time since the height of the pandemic. There is more: China’s monthly lending data released Friday also showed economywide growth in debt and equity finance outstanding stabilizing at 11% year over year after months of sharp slowdowns, and bank lending ticking up. China’s monetary policy has shifted from a tighter stance to neutral.<br />The question is why now, especially just a few months after regulators specifically told banks to curtail loan growth for the rest of the year, according to a Bloomberg report in April.<br />On the more benign side, this might be partly a response to higher seasonal liquidity needs as tax season approaches—as the People’s Bank of China has asserted. The reserve ratio cut will release around 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of liquidity, but part of this will also be used to repay maturing loans from the central bank.<br />Other explanations are less palatable. China’s quarterly gross-domestic-product figures are due Thursday, and this might be an attempt to inoculate markets against bad news.<br />Of particular concern are recent data points on consumption and services, which have remained stubbornly soft over the past year despite the rapid rebound in industry. The employment gauges of China’s official services and construction purchasing-managers indexes both ticked down significantly in June, and improvement in the 31-city-surveyed unemployment rate stalled out in May. New orders in the export sector, a major employer, have tapered off as well.</td>

      <td>The ransomware attack that brought down the Colonial Pipeline highlighted the industry’s vulnerability. We asked experts to weigh in on how the U.S. can bolster its defenses.</td>
      <td>A ransomware attack forced the largest U.S. fuel pipeline to shut down for six days in May and led to gasoline shortages across several Southeastern states. In its wake, U.S. officials have sought to bolster the defenses of an industry that for years has had fewer cybersecurity rules compared with other critical infrastructure sectors.<br />The Transportation Security Administration, which has regulatory authority over pipeline cybersecurity, recently issued a directive that would require pipelines to quickly report attacks to a cybersecurity division of the Department of Homeland Security. The Biden administration also has ordered agencies to improve their efforts to detect attacks and to strengthen their partnerships with private industries, and several cybersecurity-related bills are moving through Congress.<br />Meanwhile, Joseph Blount, chief executive of Colonial Pipeline Co., the target of the May attack, has defended his decision to pay ransom of $4.4 million in cryptocurrency to the attack’s perpetrators, saying he needed every tool at his disposal to restore the 5,500-mile pipeline’s systems. The Federal Bureau of Investigation for years has advised companies not to pay when hit with ransomware, a type of code that takes computer systems hostage for payment, because it supports a booming criminal marketplace. The Justice Department said last month it recovered about $2.3 million worth of the cryptocurrency.<br />The attack on Colonial Pipeline showed the vulnerability of the nation’s vast energy infrastructure and has spurred debate over how the U.S. and the oil-and-gas industry can better protect critical infrastructure against assaults.<br />The Wall Street Journal spoke with three experts in oil-and-gas cybersecurity about how companies, regulators and policy makers can advance the security of the nation’s energy infrastructure. Jim Guinn is global managing director for cybersecurity in energy, chemicals, utilities and mining at Accenture Security. Suzanne Lemieux is manager for operations security and emergency-response policy for the energy trade group American Petroleum Institute.

      <td>Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said Monday that fears the central bank’s new policy-making framework eventually could lead to sharp interest rate increases are off base.<br />In a largely technical speech that didn’t comment on near-term economic or monetary policy issues, Mr. Williams instead addressed concerns over what is called average inflation targeting, the new system adopted by the central bank almost a year ago.<br />Under this new regime, the Fed will allow inflation to overshoot its 2% goal to make up for periods when it has fallen short. Fed officials have left undefined the formula for this process, but they say the new regime bolsters confidence that inflation over time will stick to the Fed’s target.<br />In a text of his speech, Mr. Williams said some critics believe that average inflation targeting can lead to a big rise in interest rates once the time comes to make credit more expensive, presumably in a bid to bring inflation pressures back down to target.<br />The data suggests otherwise, he said, with Mr. Williams adding that under average inflation targeting, “there is no predictable pattern of sharp reversals or large overshooting of policy rates,” meaning there is no reason to assume sharp rate rises or overly high inflation under the Fed’s new system.</td>

      <td>The world was treated on Sunday to an amazing sight: thousands of Cubans taking to the streets in a wave of demonstrations demanding, among other things, an end to a 62-year-old dictatorship.<br />Beyond serving as a milestone moment for the island nation, the demonstrations in at least 15 cities marked the latest installment in the greatest struggle of our times: the contest between democrats and authoritarians. In recent years, authoritarians often have seemed to hold the upper hand. Yet the Cuban unrest serves to frame the key question: whether authoritarian regimes will prevail in the long term, or are sowing the seeds of their own demise.<br />The Cubans who took to the streets appeared to have some more immediate concerns on their minds. They were protesting a lack of food and a shortage of Covid-19 vaccines. But their willingness to take their protests to the actual doorstep of Cuba’s Communist Party headquarters showed a deeper dissatisfaction.<br />It’s hard to say whether Cubans on the streets, like citizens of Hong Kong pushing back against Chinese central government repression there, represent the beginnings of a new anti-authoritarian tide or mere footnotes in a generally bad time for those who cheer for democracy.<br />Certainly authoritarian regimes appear to be having a good run right now. Freedom House, a nonpartisan organization dedicated to promoting freedom and democracy, reports that freedom across the globe has declined for 15 straight years, a trend that accelerated last year. “The long democratic recession is deepening,” Freedom House says.</td>

The EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, has “decided to put on hold our work on a proposal for a digital levy” until October, said the spokesman. A proposal was expected later this month.<br />The EU’s announcement came after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen arrived in Brussels for meetings with EU finance ministers and Commission officials, where she is expected to discuss the tax deal and lobby against the proposed EU levy, which has been criticized as conflicting with the G-20 deal.<br />European officials had already indicated they would aim to ensure the EU’s digital levy wouldn’t undermine work on the global corporate minimum tax, indicating they would propose a low tax rate and structure it in a way to avoid discriminating against U.S. companies.<br />Still, by delaying the Commission’s proposal, the EU maintains some leverage if negotiations over how to implement the minimum corporate tax agreement fail.</td>

      <td>Should you lease or buy? That’s one of the main questions homeowners need to answer before installing a solar-energy system.</td>
      <td>Residential solar is now a fact of life in all 50 states. Growing awareness of solar’s role in addressing climate change is one reason; rapidly falling prices for solar panels are another. Over 2.8 million U.S. households have already gone solar, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, or SEIA, a trade group.<br />Acquiring solar these days is much like acquiring a car or a home. Consumers can buy a system outright with cash or a loan or take out a lease. With leases, typically 20 to 25 years in duration, homeowners usually have minimal upfront costs and instead pay a fixed monthly payment to a solar installer. And while they don’t own the panels, they cut their electricity bills by getting all the power the panels produce—basically swapping the electric bill from their utility for a cheaper bill from a solar leasing company.<br />Buying a system outright brings one chief advantage: the ability to claim the federal tax credit, which currently amounts to a direct rebate of 26% of the total cost of the system.<br />As the discussion below shows, there are pros and cons to each method. The decision to opt for solar isn’t a simple one. “Soft costs” such as installation and permitting fees add about $7,000 to a typical installation, and incentives to install solar still vary widely from state to state.<br />We asked three experts to discuss the economics and practicalities of home solar installation. They are Ben Airth, senior policy manager, Center for Sustainable Energy; Justin Baca, the SEIA’s vice president of markets and research; and David Feldman, market analyst, renewable-energy technologies, at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

      <td>Company’s CFO Allen Weisselberg has a narrow path to defending against charges he cheated on taxes, scholars and defense attorneys say</td>
      <td>The most serious offense leveled in a 15-count indictment of former President Donald Trump’s longtime right-hand man, Allen Weisselberg, also carries the most uncertainty for New York prosecutors, according to legal scholars and white-collar defense attorneys.<br />The charge—a single count of second-degree grand larceny—stands out in the July 1 indictment, which alleges that the Trump Organization and Mr. Weisselberg, its chief financial officer, cheated on taxes over the course of more than a decade. Prosecutors say the company secretly padded Mr. Weisselberg’s compensation, subsidizing everything from his Upper West Side residence to home furnishings and private-school tuition. In all, prosecutors say, Mr. Weisselberg concealed around $1.8 million in taxable income and evaded more than $900,000 in taxes.<br />The grand larceny allegation concerns a much smaller amount of money—around $95,000 in federal tax refunds that prosecutors say the 73-year-old executive illegally obtained in annual sums over a period from 2010 to 2018.<br />But lawyers said the charge is significant. Grand larceny in the second degree is the highest level felony Mr. Weisselberg faces, carrying a maximum prison sentence of 15 years. That’s more than twice as long as the maximum sentence of the other counts, magnifying the pressure on him to cooperate with authorities in a broader fraud probe into Mr. Trump and his business affairs.<br />Mr. Weisselberg also faces charges of tax fraud and falsifying records, as does the Trump Organization.</td>

      <td>Was the pandemic a temporary blip? Or did it fundamentally change the energy markets?</td>
      <td>As governments roll out vaccination programs and lift coronavirus-induced restrictions on travel and leisure, the world’s demand for oil is slowly returning to normal.<br />The International Energy Agency in June forecast that global crude demand will return to its pre-pandemic high during 2022’s final quarter.<br />At the same time, resurgent consumption has driven a rebound in carbon emissions—even as some wealthy countries are accelerating their push toward low-carbon energy such as wind and solar power.<br />This leads to two crucial questions: Will the energy industry look back at the pandemic and say it was a temporary blip? Or will it see the past year as a time that fundamentally altered global energy demand and supply moving forward?<br />Wall Street Journal reporter David Hodari spoke with three energy experts about those questions. Tim Gould is head of energy-supply outlooks and investment at the International Energy Agency in Paris. Amy Myers Jaffe is managing director of the climate-policy lab at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Marianne Kah is a senior research scholar and advisory-board member at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. Here are edited excerpts of the conversation.</td>

Opponents say that the benefits of credits are overstated and that alternative inducements, such as a carbon tax, are a better way to go green.</td>

      <td>Global coffee prices are climbing and threatening to drive up costs at the breakfast table as the world’s biggest coffee producer, Brazil, faces one of its worst droughts in almost a century.<br />Prices for arabica coffee beans—the main variety produced in Brazil—hit their highest level since 2016 last month. New York-traded arabica futures have risen over 18% in the past three months to $1.51 a pound. London-traded robusta—a stronger-tasting variety favored in instant coffee—has risen over 30% in the past three months, to $1,749 a metric ton, a two-year high.<br />Brazil’s farmers are girding for one of their biggest slumps in output in almost 20 years after months of drought left plants to wither. Brazil’s arabica crop cycles between one stronger year followed by a weaker year. Following a record harvest in 2020, 2021 was set to be a weaker year, but the drop is more severe than expected.<br />“I’ve been growing coffee more than 50 years, and I’ve never seen as bad a drought as the one last year and this year,” said Christina Valle, a third-generation coffee grower in Minas Gerais, Brazil’s biggest coffee-growing state. “I normally take three months to harvest my coffee; this year it took me a month,” she said.<br />Brazil’s total coffee harvest this year is expected to drop by the biggest year-over-year amount since 2003, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Its arabica crop is forecast to be almost 15 million 132-pound bags smaller than in 2020.</td>

      <td>When Shohei Ohtani joined the Los Angeles Angels in 2018, he was immediately anointed the “Japanese Babe Ruth.” It turns out that comparing him to one of the most influential figures in the history of American sports might have been wildly unfair.<br />What Ohtani is doing is far more impressive.<br />Ohtani, the two-way sensation armed with Nolan Ryan’s fastball on the mound and Ken Griffey Jr.’s power at the plate, is halfway through what could turn into the most remarkable season ever. As the game’s top players descend on Denver for the All-Star Game this week, Ohtani leads the major leagues with 33 home runs. Five of those blasts traveled more than 450 feet, the most of anybody. He also has the best slugging percentage in baseball at .698, is tied for the American League lead with four triples and has stolen 12 bases.<br />He has accomplished all of that while simultaneously establishing himself as the Angels’ best pitcher. He has a 3.49 ERA in 13 starts, a number that would be nearly a run lower if not for one disastrous outing against the New York Yankees last month. He has struck out 87 batters in 67 innings, or 11.7 per nine innings. His average four-seam fastball has been measured at 95.5 mph.<br />Now Ohtani is the first player ever to be selected as an All-Star as a pitcher and hitter. If he can continue this level of production for another few months, his paradigm-shifting performance would reshape what was believed to be possible on a baseball field. Nobody has ever done anything like this before—not even the legendary Babe.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—An Iranian oil executive removed from U.S. financial blacklists last month because he had resigned from Iran’s national oil company now holds senior positions with two Iranian energy firms linked to the Iranian government, according to company officials and regulatory filings.<br />The executive’s role at the two companies appears to violate U.S. sanctions, analysts said, and is expected to fuel concern among U.S. lawmakers critical of the administration’s Iran policy. Both companies contract with Iran’s state energy firms, including the blacklisted National Iranian Oil Company, and one of the firms is substantially owned by a sanctioned state-owned Iranian bank.<br />Former NIOC Chief Executive Ahmad Ghalebani was taken off the U.S. Iran sanctions list on June 11 because he no longer held that position in the state firm, “a verified change in behavior” according to the Treasury Department. Mr. Ghalebani stepped down from that post in 2013, the same year he was originally blacklisted by the U.S.<br />The sanctions removal, made at Mr. Ghalebani’s request, lifted financial blocks from any assets he may have had within the U.S. and affords him unfettered access to the U.S. and other foreign markets. Critics said the removals weakened the U.S.’s negotiating position, among other objections.<br />Mr. Ghalebani continues to serve as an adviser to the chief executive of Iranian oil-services firm Global Petro Tech Kish, according to a representative of the company, and was chosen as chairman of a shareholders meeting in late May of petrochemical firm AzarAb Industries, according to a filing with the Iranian stock exchange.</td>

Some fleet operators and dealers say factory orders for pickup trucks and cargo vans have been sitting unfilled for months.<br />In some cases, the inventory crunch has prevented businesses from buying new vehicles to replace older models. In others, it has hampered their ability to expand operations to satiate booming demand related to an uptick in construction, home renovations and other services.<br />Randy Blubaugh said his home-cleaning business outside Dallas is receiving between 50 and 70 calls a week from households asking for on-site assessments his business can’t handle without more cars.</td>

      <td>A swift vaccine rollout is one factor boosting the case for Brookdale Senior Living</td>
      <td>Investors have picked over almost every reopening trade imaginable. But there is a fresh opportunity as the senior-living industry rebounds from an especially harsh pandemic blow.<br />It wasn’t just that nursing homes and related facilities were early epicenters of Covid-19 outbreaks, which gave would-be customers an obvious reason not to send their relatives to one. The industry was also hit by the economic fallout from the pandemic: Demand for senior-living services is sensitive to the economy as residents and their families often need to come up with the money themselves, especially following the financial turmoil that has beset long-term-care insurance providers.<br />Brookdale Senior Living, a publicly traded operator of nearly 700 senior-living facilities and other senior-living communities in 42 states across the U.S., was certainly no exception. Occupancy rates at Brookdale fell to 69.4% earlier this year from about 82% before the pandemic. The hit to the top line was coupled with Covid-19 related expenses such as personal protective equipment and extra pay for staff. Brookdale shares were down more than 75% at the nadir of the crisis.<br />Thanks to a swift vaccine rollout, however, the picture at Brookdale is noticeably brighter today. “It felt like we moved heaven and earth to make this happen,” said Chief Executive Lucinda “Cindy” Baier in an interview.<br />That effort entailed, for instance, securing priority status for residents in both federal and state vaccine rollouts and partnering with pharmacies to deliver the shots. About 93% of residents have accepted a vaccine, and Covid-19 cases at Brookdale facilities are down 97% from the peak. And while occupancy remains well below pre-pandemic levels, the rate has improved steadily over the past four months to 71.2%.</td>

      <td>Senior investment manager of private equity for state’s roughly $194.7 billion pension system says it has declined co-investment and secondary opportunities that seem “priced to perfection”</td>
      <td>This year’s acceleration in deal making and fundraising, coupled with the rise in liquidity solutions in recent favor such as blank-check companies and sponsor-led continuation funds, has posed new challenges for backers of private-equity funds even as it has opened up fresh opportunities. As part of our series on the state of private equity at the halfway point of 2021, WSJ Pro Private Equity caught up with John Bradley, senior investment officer, private equity at the Florida State Board of Administration to learn more about how the roughly $194.7 billion pension system is positioning its private-equity portfolio. Responses have been edited for clarity and style.<br />WSJ Pro: What are some emerging trends in private equity that you are tracking?<br />Mr. Bradley: Some past trends have reappeared in the past few years: bigger funds, faster investment pacing, shorter fundraising cycles, higher leverage multiples, and valuation multiples hitting all-time highs. To us, these feel like late-cycle indicators. A few new trends that stand out are: [Fund general partners] raising single asset vehicles to buy a big winner from an older fund that they want to hold longer, GPs raising funds to invest in single asset vehicles of other GPs, and GPs raising [special-purpose acquisition companies] to invest outside of their core strategy.<br />WSJ Pro: How have you modified your private-equity investment thesis and sub-strategies, if at all, this year?<br />Mr. Bradley: We seem to be a little more bearish across the board, but this hasn’t materially impacted our sub-strategies. Geographically, adding exposure to China and Europe has become more challenging due to travel restrictions. We are still very bullish on technology over the long-term. However, over the short-term adding additional exposure has become challenging as it’s close to 50% of our portfolio and valuation multiples are at historic highs. We’ve spent a lot of time looking at the energy sector (traditional oil and gas) and have developed a lot of conviction. We believe the current downturn is cyclical (not secular) and we’re trying to take advantage of that.</td>

      <td>Despite its successful flights to the edge of space,  Virgin Galactic  may be too down to Earth in its long-term promise.<br />On Sunday, British billionaire Richard Branson traveled to the thermosphere—54 miles above sea level—aboard his space plane VSS Unity. This happened 20 years after another rich entrepreneur, Dennis Tito, became the world’s first space tourist, and nine days before  Amazon.com  founder Jeff Bezos is scheduled to go to space with his own privately held company, Blue Origin.<br />The market impact of Mr. Branson beating his rival to the punch shouldn’t be underestimated. Because Virgin Galactic is one of few high-profile space companies to trade, it has become a favorite in the retail-investor community. Flow tracker VandaTrack shows that the buzz around the launch has sucked in retail money, helping to double Virgin’s share price relative to the start of the year.<br />Being first, though, doesn’t mean going furthest. Blue Origin has poked fun at its rival by pointing out that its New Shepard is a true vertical landing and takeoff rocket rather than a “high-altitude airplane” like Virgin’s SpaceShipTwo, and that it will actually fly above the Kármán line that some international organizations use to define the edge of space, 62 miles above sea level.<br />Of course, arbitrary definitions about where space starts don’t matter for the purpose of giving people a few minutes of weightlessness. Vindicating Mr. Branson’s vision, there seems to be tangible demand for this experience: 600 people have already reserved tickets for between $200,000 and $250,000 a piece, Virgin says, and 400 more want to book when sales resume soon. Based on the company’s revenue estimates, fares will rise to between $300,000 and $400,000.</td>

      <td>Hedge funds and other speculative investors recently pushed bets on rising oil prices to their highest level in years, a sign that one-sided positioning is sparking big moves in the world’s busiest commodity market.<br />The ratio of bullish bets on U.S. crude to bearish wagers surged to 23-to-1 during the week of June 15, the highest level since the summer of 2018 and nearly triple the figure from five weeks earlier, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. While the ratio has edged lower in more recent weeks, it has stayed at levels considered elevated by many analysts and well above 6-to-1, where it started the year.<br />The upbeat sentiment has made oil one of the hottest trades on Wall Street, briefly pushing U.S. crude prices earlier this month above $75 a barrel and to the highest closing level since late 2018. Prices have roughly doubled since the end of October.<br />But investors crowding into the market are also fueling concerns that oil has risen too quickly, a force that can cause market turbulence. The CFTC data measure futures and options, which are commonly used by professional investors to wager on oil-price movements and by energy producers to hedge against volatility.<br />Last week, prices briefly hit their highest point in more than six years on July 6 before ending the day down more than 2%. The volatility continued, with oil frequently changing directions before surging Friday and ending the week down slightly at about $74.50 a barrel. One reason investors cited for sharp reversals in a matter of minutes during trading sessions was the bullish positioning. With so many analysts anticipating further gains, the slightest bit of bad news can prompt traders to unwind some of their holdings.</td>

      <td>For the past few decades, the Federal Reserve has succeeded in keeping inflation low—perhaps too low. It had an assist: Shifts in the global economy, including globalization, demographics and the rise of e-commerce, helped keep prices in check.<br />Some economists say these so-called secular forces have begun to reverse in ways that the pandemic has intensified.<br />“The factors that were…playing a significant role in that low-inflation environment last cycle are beginning to fade,” said Sarah House, director and senior economist at Wells Fargo.<br />That could have important implications for the Fed as it grapples with how much of the current inflation pickup is temporary, and for the U.S. economy as a whole. Ms. House said it means that either inflation will run higher in the years ahead or the Fed will have to keep monetary policy tighter than it otherwise would to meet its 2% inflation target.<br />Economists point to several secular shifts that could give rise to new inflationary pressures.</td>

      <td>Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin isn’t ready to call for an end to the U.S. central bank’s $120 billion a month in bond-buying stimulus given where the labor market stands today.<br />When it comes to slowing the pace of asset buying, “if the labor market can clear relatively quickly, then maybe it can happen sooner, but if it takes longer for the labor market to reopen, it goes a little later,” Mr. Barkin said in a Wall Street Journal interview Friday.<br />The official said he hopes the job market will reach “relatively soon” the threshold the central bank has laid out as a trigger point for pulling back on asset buying.<br />The policy maker said the employment-to-population ratio is important to him in determining when the central bank can dial back on the stimulus it is providing the economy. This ratio stood at 61.1% in February 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the U.S. and economic activity cratered. It bottomed out in April of that year at 51.3% and has risen since, hitting 58% this June. Mr. Barkin said he would like to see something just north of 59% before he believes it would be time to start reducing bond buying.<br />Fed officials have been debating whether the economy has healed enough to cut back the $80 billion a month in Treasury and $40 billion a month in mortgage bond purchases. Some officials, like Dallas Fed leader Robert Kaplan, want action sooner rather than later, while Philadelphia Fed leader Patrick Harker said in a recent interview he would like the Fed to start slowing the pace of asset buying this year and wind it down over the course of a year.</td>

      <td>Most poor countries put all hands on deck in this crisis. Havana exports its doctors.</td>
      <td>Cubans poured into the streets Sunday to protest the government’s handling of the Covid crisis. As the virus races across Cuba, independent lawyers, medical professionals and civil-society groups on the island have begged Havana to allow international humanitarian aid to reach people directly. The regime refuses. Now the crisis is near cataclysmic proportions.<br />Havana wants the world to believe that Cuban hardship in healthcare is caused by the U.S. embargo. But food and medicine are exempt from the embargo. As Julie Chung, now acting assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, tweeted in April 2020 that the U.S. “routinely authorizes the export of humanitarian goods, agricultural products, medicine, and medical equipment to support the Cuban people.” Ms. Chung further noted that in 2019 the U.S. exported millions of dollars of medical goods to Cuba.<br />Cuba’s real problem is that it’s broke. And while all poor countries in the region have struggled to serve the public during Covid-19, only Cuba has made things worse by trying to use the pandemic as a way to earn hard currency for the ruling elite and boost its legitimacy around the world.<br />Shortages of medications for treatable illnesses in Cuba are routine. The contagious mite infestation of the skin known as scabies, for example, can be remedied with antibiotics and topical medicines like permethrin. Yet Cuban public-health officials have been helpless to stop it from spreading across the island.<br />“It’s horrible and exasperating to see your children sick, and not be able to do anything because there are no medications,” a mother in the city of Mayarí told the newspaper Diario de Cuba in February. “I went to the hospital and there’s nothing to cure it either. It’s a tragedy.”</td>

      <td>Western politicians have failed to persuade their own voters to commit economic suicide by banning fossil fuels, and forget about China, Russia or India. The climate lobby’s fallback, which is starting to emerge, is to punish the foreigners and their own consumers with climate tariffs.<br />Bureaucrats at the European Commission are due to unveil the proposed Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) later this month, but a draft recently leaked. Brussels wants to impose tariffs to bring the cost of carbon-dioxide emissions tied to an imported good into line with what a European producer would pay to produce the same good.<br />This is an admission that the European Union’s emissions-trading scheme (ETS) is bad for the economy. European companies are less competitive because they have to pay for their emissions and foreign companies don’t. Environmentalists say the ETS encourages companies to send production offshore to avoid the ETS, which greens call “carbon leakage” and most people would call common sense. The CBAM is intended to level the playing field, at least within the European market.<br />Even on those terms, the draft plan is a failure. It starts small, applying at first to a handful of industries such as iron, steel and fertilizers. And it doesn’t account fully for environmental compliance costs. The CBAM will be tied to the cost of tradable emissions permits, but it won’t factor in the expenses European companies bear for a complex web of green subsidies, feed-in tariffs and the like that increase energy costs at factories.<br />The bigger problems are that a carbon tariff would impose an enormous burden on companies seeking to sell to the EU—even the low-emitting firms—and as a result probably will trigger a trade war. China, India, Brazil and South Africa are already objecting.</td>

      <td>President Biden likes to say he wants to restore America’s moral leadership in the world, but sometimes it seems his team at the White House wants to change something merely because Donald Trump supported it.<br />We hope that’s not what’s driving the White House to consider changing the annual proclamation for Captive Nations Week, which is scheduled to take place this year from July 18-24. Every year since 1959 American Presidents have issued a Captive Nations proclamation condemning Soviet and Communist imperialism and repression. The proclamation is issued shortly before the week itself and has featured robust language.<br />We’re told that White House aides this year have been floating the idea of ditching the Captive Nations phrase in favor of “Free and Open Societies Week.” They’ve been calling around to see how that idea would go down with folks who care about America’s moral and diplomatic standing. The answer is not too well.<br />The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, an umbrella group that represents victims of oppression, has sent a letter to Mr. Biden urging him “to demonstrate the commitment of the United States to promoting liberty and human rights” by issuing “a strong 2021 Captive Nations Week proclamation.”<br />The difference here may seem semantic, but the notion of Captive Nations carries a lot more moral weight than “free and open societies.” The former signifies that Communists and authoritarians subjugate entire populations. A change would be especially ill-timed when the Chinese Communist Party has crushed the autonomy it promised to Hong Kong and consigned millions of ethnic Uyghurs to re-education camps. In the contest between democracy and authoritarians, language matters.</td>

His climate model of California is showing the limits and risks of this strategy.<br />California’s Independent System Operator (Caiso) on Friday and Saturday issued emergency alerts urging residents to conserve power during the evenings to avoid rolling blackouts. A wildfire in Oregon threatened transmission lines that import thousands of megawatts of hydropower that are needed when the sun starts to go down.<br />Progressives blamed Texas’s power outage in February on its limited ability to import power from other states after its wind turbines froze and not enough natural gas plants could ramp up to compensate. But grids in neighboring states had little power to spare, which was the problem this weekend in California and will continue to be all summer.<br />The California Public Utilities Commission ordered Caiso last month to procure more power for evening hours this summer due to reduced hydropower generation and imports caused by drought. It’s not clear where Caiso plans to get the power since supply is expected to be tight across the Western U.S. for the same reasons.<br />Rest assured, Caiso has a back-up plan: Snatch energy headed elsewhere. Caiso manages interconnections between utilities and power providers across the Western U.S. For instance, Arizona utilities contract with hydropower plants in the Northwest for power that is transmitted through California.</td>

      <td>Ed Husain once defended Islam in terms of Blair-era multiculturalism. Now he invites Muslims to join the ‘British mainstream.’</td>
      <td>The future of relations between Muslims and non-Muslims in the United Kingdom may be a troubled one. Ed Husain sounds the alarm in “Among the Mosques: A Journey Across Muslim Britain.” The book chronicles his visits to 10 cities. Mr. Husain, a British writer and political adviser, takes us into local mosques for Friday prayers and relates his encounters, planned and unplanned, with local personalities in Muslim communities. Some of the communities he visits exhibit the very best British traditions of tolerance and pluralism, but most do not.<br />The Markazi Mosque in the northern mill town of Dewsbury, Mr. Husain writes, “is the European central office of the largest Muslim organisation in the world, the Tableeghi Jamaat.” The original goal of the organization, founded in 1927 in India, was to oppose the British Raj and “to stop the dilution of Muslim identity in the cosmopolitan cities of British India.” Its members are great proselytizers. Knocking on doors across the Muslim world, they are, as Mr. Husain puts it, “essentially the (male-only) Muslim version of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”<br />The annual Tableeghi convention in Bangladesh attracts five million Muslim men from around the world. Women are not welcome. The Tableeghis are particularly prominent in the U.K., where, by Mr. Husain’s count, the Deobandi movement, of which the Tableeghi Jamaat is the missionary arm, controls “more than half of Britain’s mosques.”<br />Like the Muslim Brotherhood, which sprang up in Egypt around the same time, the Tableeghi Jamaat sees modern Western culture as an assault on Islam. To counterattack, it promotes an understanding of Islam that organizes every aspect of life, including politics. Mr. Husain puts it this way: “While political Islamists in the Muslim Brotherhood target the state and seek to change its laws through elections and parliaments, as in Egypt and Syria, and their jihadi cousins in al-Qaeda and ISIS use violence in seeking to restore a caliphate in several Muslim countries, the Tableeghi Jamaat believe in bottom-up change, and work for their caliphate from the masses upwards.”<br />This bottom-up strategy leads to the construction of a parallel society. Banning music and alcohol helps to wall Muslims off from the prevailing British culture, as does the creation of sharia courts that provide members an alternative to the state on matters of personal status, such as marriage and divorce. When Mr. Husain asks a cleric in Dewsbury why there are no women in the mosque, the cleric directs him to a book, “Guidance for a Muslim Wife.” A sample line from that work: “When a woman leaves her home without her husband’s consent, then all the angels of the skies and the entire universe curse her for this act until she returns home.”</td>

      <td>A new report details a culture of bureaucracy and risk-aversion that is corroding readiness.</td>
      <td>Is the U.S. Navy ready for war? A new report prepared by Marine Lt. Gen. Robert Schmidle and Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, both retired, for members of Congress paints a portrait of the Navy as an institution adrift. The report, reviewed exclusively by the Journal, concludes that the surface Navy is not focused on preparing for war and is weathering a crisis in leadership and culture.<br />The impetus for the report was a series of recent catastrophes—a ship burning in San Diego last year; two destroyer collisions in the Pacific in 2017. Were these isolated events? Or did they indicate “larger institutional issues that are degrading the performance of the entire naval surface force”? The report surveyed active and recently retired service members of various ranks, conducting 77 candid hourlong interviews. A key finding: “Many sailors found their leadership distracted, captive to bureaucratic excess, and rewarded for the successful execution of administrative functions” rather than core competencies of war.<br />“I guarantee you every unit in the Navy is up to speed on their diversity training,” said one recently retired senior enlisted leader. “I’m sorry that I can’t say the same of their ship-handling training.”<br />Adm. Montgomery told me in an interview over the weekend that when he was a junior officer in the 1980s there was “an intense focus” on a likely confrontation with the Soviet navy—learning about classes of ships or the missiles aboard. After decades without a peer adversary at sea, “the same focus is not permeating the Navy today.”<br />The Navy has improved its pipeline for surface-warfare officers since the 2017 collisions, reversing a 2003 money-saving mistake of training junior officers by giving them 23 compact discs loaded with reading material. But the Navy doesn’t spend the money and time training surface warfare officers that it does submariners or aviators, and has revamped training so many times, usually in an effort to spend even less money, that commanding officers are left with “inconsistent, often ill-prepared wardrooms.”</td>

Who are its partners?<br />As he mulls these questions, the president should take note of a July 16 conference, hosted by the government of Uzbekistan in Tashkent, on the subject of “regional connectivity.” The Uzbeks and their Central Asian neighbors, including Afghanistan, seek international diplomatic and economic support for new transport and infrastructure projects to connect their region with South and Southeast Asia.<br />A meeting for technocrats? The list of confirmed participants tells a different story. The foreign ministers of China, Russia, Iran, Turkey and India will attend, as well as the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan. These countries recognize that the issue of connectivity will determine the economic orientation of the rising powers of Central Asia, and even their self-determination and openness.<br />When Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan were still part of the Soviet Union, Moscow controlled their economies and diverted all their international trade and communications through Russia. The Soviet Union ended 30 years ago but elements of these deformations have endured. With the rise of Uzbekistan’s reforming President Shavkat Mirziyoyev five years ago and Kazakhstan’s concurrent effort to diversify and open its economy, barriers to trade began to fall.<br />Central Asian countries are reclaiming the ancient links among them that Russian colonialism sought to destroy. Thanks to America’s presence in Afghanistan, they could also reach out once more to Kabul as their sixth ancient partner. This quest is at once Central Asia’s key economic project, a bulwark of its cultural rebirth, and its move to secure self-determination in a neighborhood dominated by China, Russia and Iran.</td>

Coined in 1969 by Mario Procaccino, the Democratic Party’s unsuccessful challenger to New York Mayor John Lindsay, the epithet described “hypocritical wealthy do-gooders insulated from the negative fallout of their bad ideas,” in historian David Callahan’s definition.<br />“This theme,” Mr. Callahan has written, “remained a staple of conservative attacks.” Sen. Ted Kennedy was a classic example. He sent his kids to exclusive private schools at the same time he was telling working-class whites to bus their kids to distressed schools in the slums.<br />In this year’s New York mayor’s race, the limousine-liberal attack came from the left again, with the help of a conservative tabloid. The target was Maya Wiley, who was endorsed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and finished either second or third in the June 22 Democratic primary.<br />“She’s not Maya from the block,” began a June 19 New York Post story. She’s emphasized “her progressive bona fides and hard-bitten personal story. But it’s a tale that has often required looking past a number of silver spoons, and alleged hypocrisy.”<br />Among other things, the Post noted that Ms. Wiley earned as much as $300,000 a year as a college administrator and lives in “a historic Prospect Park South estate valued at $2.7 million,” and that, like Kennedy, she enrolled one of her daughters in “an elite private school.”</td>

      <td>As probe continues, Haitians are thrown into uncertainty; some cast doubt on Colombians’ alleged role in killing</td>
      <td>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti—Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, who was assassinated last week in a killing that has plunged this impoverished island nation into turmoil, had few guards outside his private residence on most days, say neighbors and those who knew him.<br />The assassination was carried out at about 1 a.m. on Wednesday. The assailants broke in, subdued Mr. Moïse’s guards and housekeeping staff, then shot the president 12 times—with one shot directly in his forehead, according to investigators. His eye had also been gouged out, the investigators said.<br />Neighbor Philogene Charles, 40 years old, said Mr. Moïse’s presence had given a sense of calm to the city’s Pelerin 5 district, where upscale mansions share a hillside with crowded slums. Suspicions and theories have flourished about the killing, including that it was an inside job and not a hit by foreign mercenaries, as the government officials have said.<br />“Nobody other than the president and his wife has a scratch on them. How can that be?” said Ms. Charles.<br />Haiti’s police chief, Leon Charles, has said that close to 30 foreign mercenaries were involved in the attack. Haiti officials say security forces killed at least three suspected assailants and arrested 18 Colombians and two Haitian-Americans believed to be involved.</td>

      <td>After extra time finished with the score tied at 1, the Three Lions are haunted by another penalty shootout in a major tournament</td>
      <td>LONDON—In England’s 55 years of waiting for another crack at a major-tournament final, nothing had caused it more sporting trauma than one of the simplest tasks in soccer: nailing a penalty shot from 12 yards out.<br />Penalty shootouts had dashed the hopes of English teams for decades, at World Cups and at European Championships. No matter how talented a squad was, it seemed there was always a devastating shootout in their future.<br />So as the Euro 2020 final ticked away on Sunday night, the dread of another one washed over Wembley Stadium. This time, it was Italy handing the Three Lions a crushing disappointment to rival any in a collection that spans more than half a century.<br />After 90 minutes of regulation and 30 more of extra time ended with the score at 1-1, the Azzurri held their nerve to become European Champions for the first time since 1968. And England had its signature heartbreak.<br />Two players from each side had already missed in the penalty shootout by the time 19-year-old England winger Bukayo Saka stepped up to the spot. Needing to score to keep his team alive, he could only watch as Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma dove to his left and met his shot with both hands.</td>

      <td>LONDON—Hundreds of ticketless fans rushed into Wembley Stadium here on Sunday evening ahead of England’s European Championship final showdown with Italy, causing clashes in the stands and raising fears about security surrounding the game.<br />The first breaches occurred around two hours before kickoff as dozens of people burst through barriers surrounding the stadium and streamed into the concourses, overwhelming police and security guards.<br />“Fans have been jumping over barriers but there has been no access to the stadium,” UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, said in a statement to reporters. It added that there was “no concern that any protocol will come into place in which the stadium will be shut down.”<br />Yet all over the stands, stewards were seen removing fans without tickets, while others simply bounced from seat to seat to evade detection. The Metropolitan Police had earlier urged people to stay away from the stadium if they didn’t have tickets. The streets around Wembley, however, were packed hours before kickoff as people flocked to nearby bars ahead of the England men’s team’s first major-tournament final in 55 years.<br />Wembley normally holds 90,000 people, but attendance was capped at 60,000 due to pandemic restrictions.</td>

The deceleration is likely due to the Covid-19 resurgence in the country’s biggest export hub. Economists estimate imports also eased, leaving the trade surplus flat at $45.5 billion last month.<br />The U.S. consumer-price index is expected to post another significant gain in June, underscoring a run-up in inflation as the economy emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. The Federal Reserve in a report out Friday said supply chain bottlenecks for goods such as cars and appliances are creating inflation that could be “more lasting but likely still temporary.”<br />WEDNESDAY</td>

      <td>The virus won’t go away, but vaccinations show a path to normalcy</td>
      <td>A handful of countries, including the U.S., are leading the way toward a future where Covid-19 has faded into the background.<br />Even as the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus is propelling new infections world-wide, these governments are hoping that their high vaccination rates will protect many of the most vulnerable to the disease, allowing a return to more normal life.<br />It is a future where officials hope that they will be able to treat the coronavirus like influenza, which causes tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S. every year without prompting damaging economic lockdowns. Vaccinations are the key: Covid-19 causes many more fatalities per infection than the flu, but vaccines significantly reduce people’s chances of catching the coronavirus and the seriousness of the disease if they do.<br />The virus will remain, however, a fact of life. “This is a virus that we’re going to have to learn to live with, and we’re going to have to learn to manage and we’re going to have Covid-19 patients for the foreseeable future,” said Edward A. Stenehjem, an infectious-disease specialist at Intermountain Healthcare in Murray, Utah, where cases resulting from the Delta variant have risen lately.<br />These highly vaccinated countries are the exceptions in a world where most have largely unvaccinated populations. Their authorities’ appetite for risk varies—even across jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada—but vaccinations are breaking a pattern seen earlier in the pandemic when rising case rates inevitably prompted tightening restrictions.</td>

      <td>Company announces the Marvel film also grossed more than $60 million on Disney+ platform</td>
      <td>Finally back in theaters, Hollywood’s dominant film franchise posted the biggest opening of the pandemic era as Marvel spinoff “Black Widow” ruled this weekend’s box office.<br />Walt Disney Co. ’s “Black Widow,” starring Scarlett Johansson in the titular role, grossed $80 million in the U.S. and Canada, according to preliminary studio estimates. The total bolsters hopes for a moviegoing rebound. For more than a year, the pandemic decimated the film industry as authorities closed businesses and public spaces to curb the spread of Covid-19.<br />The performance of “Black Widow” builds on the recent success of the latest “Fast & Furious” film, “F9: The Fast Saga,” which two weeks ago also set a highwater mark for a domestic box-office debut during the pandemic, by grossing $70 million in its opening weekend.  Comcast Corp.’s  Universal Pictures distributed the movie, which has made $141.3 in North America and $541.8 million globally.<br />The solid weekend of box-office grosses for “Black Widow” scored below average as far as Marvel debuts go. According to Box Office Mojo, when compared with all 24 Marvel Cinematic Universe titles dating back to 2008, the opening weekend of “Black Widow” ranks 19th, right behind “Doctor Strange,” which Disney released in 2016.<br />“Black Widow” is the first Marvel film Disney has released to theaters in more than two years. The last Marvel movie Disney sent to theaters, “Avengers: Endgame,” grossed nearly $2.8 billion world-wide, making for a brief time the highest-grossing film of all time.</td>
