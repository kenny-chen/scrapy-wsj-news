      <td>The $300 weekly subsidy for not working was a terrible blunder.</td>
      <td>Businesses nearly everywhere in America say they’re desperate for workers, and the latest statistical evidence is the Labor Department’s Jolts report Tuesday of a record 9.3 million job openings in April. Get the message, Congress?<br />The Jolts survey has never shown more openings since Labor began keeping track in 2000. Job openings increased 998,000 in April, including 391,000 in leisure and hospitality, 108,000 in trade and transportation and 102,000 in manufacturing as more states lifted Covid-19 restrictions. Yet new hires increased by a mere 69,000. Employers filled about one in 15 new positions.<br />The mismatch between labor supply and demand was especially acute in construction, where hires declined by 107,000 even as job openings increased by 23,000. Manufacturing job openings increased by 102,000 while hires fell 38,000. Worker shortages are contributing to supply-chain bottlenecks and higher prices for businesses and consumers.<br />A Chamber of Commerce survey last week found that 90.5% of companies said a lack of available workers was slowing the economy in their area, which was twice as many as cited pandemic issues. The American Hotel & Lodging Association reported that 96% of its respondents had open positions, but most pay less than sitting on the couch collecting enhanced subsidies for not working.<br />The Biden Administration chalks up the slow jobs rebound to lack of child care or fear of Covid. But Covid has been subsiding fast due to vaccines. Far more schools were open in April than in December, so more parents should also be able to return to work.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Senate on Tuesday approved a bipartisan, $250 billion bill boosting government spending on technology research and development amid rising competition from China and other nations.<br />The bill passed 68-32. It won approval after being delayed just before the Senate’s Memorial Day recess, as some Republican lawmakers raised last-minute concerns about its size and scope.<br />The legislation represents a potential landmark effort to turn the tide on several long-term trends in U.S. competitiveness. Those include eroding federal investments in research overall and a shrinking share of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing.<br />Backers contend the U.S. also has lacked an agency clearly focused on cutting-edge science such as artificial intelligence technology. The bill proposes an expanded role for the National Science Foundation to fill that gap.<br />“Today’s bill is about investing in that innovation economy of the future,” said Sen. Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.), who chairs the Commerce Committee. She and others compared the legislation with previous federal efforts that helped lead to breakthroughs in computer networks, energy, biosciences and other areas.</td>

      <td>Google’s critics have said for years that it should be treated like a public utility. On Tuesday, Ohio’s attorney general filed a lawsuit asking a judge to rule that the search company is one.<br />The case adds to the legal woes confronting the  Alphabet Inc.  subsidiary, which also faces antitrust lawsuits from the Justice Department and a separate consortium of states led by Colorado and Texas. The company is contending with cases in countries around the world where its dominance as a search provider has sparked a push by regulators to corral its power.<br />Amid the array of court challenges, Ohio said that it is the first state in the country to bring a lawsuit seeking a court declaration that Google is a common carrier subject under state law to government regulation. The lawsuit, which doesn’t seek monetary damages, says that Google has a duty to provide the same rights for advertisements and product placement for competitors as it provides for its own services.<br />“When you own the railroad or the electric company or the cellphone tower, you have to treat everyone the same and give everybody access,” said Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a Republican.<br />A Google spokesman said that the remedies sought in the Ohio lawsuit would worsen the company’s search results and impair businesses’ ability to connect directly with customers. “Ohioans simply don’t want the government to run Google like a gas or electric company,” a spokesman said. “This lawsuit has no basis in fact or law and we’ll defend ourselves against it in court.”</td>

The announcement comes months after Apple’s curbs on in-app tracking roiled the digital-ad industry, and the changes will be part of a new version of Apple’s operating system this fall.<br />While the earlier moves affected only apps within Apple’s iOS operating system, the latest changes encompass all forms of web traffic on Apple devices, leading advertisers, email marketers, publishers and ad-tech companies to anticipate broader ramifications.<br />Apple’s changes mark “a massive step to increase the walls in the garden by making sure all access to the external world would be proxy by them,” said Tal Chalozin, chief technology officer of ad-tech company Innovid Inc.<br />Craig Federighi, Apple senior vice president of software engineering, described the moves Monday as shielding users against data-gathering practices that many aren’t aware of. “We believe in protecting your privacy and giving you transparency and control over your information,” he said at the conference.</td>

      <td>Someone leaked the tax information of individuals to serve the left’s agenda.</td>
      <td>That didn’t take long. Less than half a year into the Biden Presidency, the Internal Revenue Service is already at the center of an abuse-of-power scandal. That news broke Tuesday when ProPublica, a website whose journalism promotes progressive causes, published information from what it said are 15 years of the tax returns of Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and other rich Americans.<br />Leaking such information is a crime, since under federal law tax returns are confidential. ProPublica says it received the files from “an anonymous source” and doesn’t know who provided them, how they were obtained, or what the source’s motives are.<br />Allow us to fill in that last blank. The story arrives amid the Biden Administration’s effort to pass the largest tax increase as a share of the economy since 1968. The main Democratic argument for a tax hike is that the rich should pay their “fair share.” The ProPublica story is a long argument that somehow the rich don’t pay enough. The timing here is no coincidence, comrade.<br />Someone at the IRS—or someone who hacked the IRS—leaked the documents to influence the debate in Congress. And right on time, Ron Wyden, the Senate’s chief tax writer, opened a Finance Committee hearing Tuesday by mentioning the ProPublica data dump.<br />“What this data reveals is that the country’s wealthiest—who profited immensely during the pandemic—have not been paying their fair share,” Mr. Wyden said. “I’ll have a proposal to change that.” You can bet he will.</td>

Specifically, he promised to veto any redistricting map “drafted or created by legislators, political party leaders and/or their staffs or allies.” But on Friday he broke that promise, and it will now take its rightful place in the annals of political whoppers beside George H.W. Bush’s famous pledge not to raise taxes.<br />The new map diminishes the already diminished Republican presence in Springfield. Fourteen Republican-held seats in the state house will be squeezed into seven, for example, guaranteeing a loss of at least seven GOP incumbents. No Democratic incumbents will lose seats as a result of a combined new district. It also redraws the boundaries for the state’s Supreme Court for the first time since 1964—an effort to maintain the 4-3 Democratic majority on what is an elected court.<br />Adding to the wholly politicized nature of the effort is that redistricting is supposed to be done based on the latest Census results. But because of Covid-19, the results won’t come in time to meet the state constitutional deadline of June 30. The state provides for this—a bipartisan, eight-member commission would then take charge—but Democrats went ahead with less reliable and detailed data.<br />Last week we gave Mr. Pritzker the benefit of the doubt that he might keep his word, but we have relearned the eternal lesson: Never trust a politician.</td>

An exchange of offers last week did little to resolve the major disputes, with Republicans continuing to reject Mr. Biden’s ideas for raising revenue and the White House arguing that the Republicans’ counteroffers were too small.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Mr. Biden informed Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.), the lead Republican negotiator, that the latest offer from the Republican group didn’t meet his threshold for spending on infrastructure, clean energy and job creation. She also said the White House felt its efforts in talks to close the spending gap with the GOP stance hadn’t been fully reciprocated.<br />Republicans, meanwhile, said Mr. Biden hadn’t shown enough willingness to narrow the scope to more traditional infrastructure projects and scale down the cost accordingly. They had also favored user fees, which the White House rejected, rather than higher taxes to pay for new spending.</td>

      <td>They write exceptions into the tax code, then blame Big Business for them.</td>
      <td>We keep hearing that the corporate tax code is riddled with “loopholes” and that large corporations are tax cheats for using them and not paying their “fair share.” Is it true? No, most large corporations pay the amount in taxes they do because Congress expressly wrote the tax code to allow them to pay that amount.<br />Corporations do game the system. Recent academic evidence pegs America’s losses from corporate profit shifting in 2017—in large part a response to the uncompetitive U.S. tax system before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—at $26 billion. The uncollected income tax owed by corporations was estimated most recently by the Internal Revenue Service at $32 billion in 2013.<br />The more significant revenue loss, however, is from exceptions to the tax code. When it comes to lost corporate tax revenue, exceptions are the rule, and not following the rules is the exception.<br />Many provisions allow taxpayers to pay less tax. Some are clearly one-off boondoggles, while others achieve a social good. For instance, the tax code encourages investment in new factories and machinery through the accelerated-depreciation tax deduction, the use of net operating losses to encourage businesses to try ideas that may not always work out, and tax credits that stimulate innovation generally or in specific pursuits, such as curing rare diseases. These all decrease the revenue generated by the corporate tax. But they were instituted to accomplish a goal, not because of some nefarious plot by Big Business.<br />It isn’t useful to speak of loopholes. In many cases, corporations are doing exactly what Congress intended them to do. Take the Clean Energy for America Act, which the Senate Finance Committee marked up in May. Hoping to influence corporate behavior, supporters of the bill are rewriting the tax code to reward renewable-energy firms, even though many are doing fine already.</td>

      <td>One station played ‘Taps’ when signing off at the end of the broadcast day.</td>
      <td>‘Do I amuse you?” Joe Pesci’s character said in the 1990 movie “Goodfellas.” Today it’s a question no one needs to ask. The amusement industry keeps growing. Every second of the day or night, tens of thousands of entertainment options are instantly available on screens that are as common as toothbrushes.<br />Sometimes it’s difficult to remember a time when there wasn’t a single thing to watch for seven or eight hours a day. But that was the case during the first decade that television was taking over American life, and no one thought it odd.<br />Before the 1950s there was nary a screen in most U.S. homes. Soon, though, manufacturers of TV sets were frantically shipping units as fast as they could. It was as if people were hypnotized; they couldn’t get enough television.<br />Yet broadcasters assumed that when families went to sleep, so should TV stations. From late at night until after sunrise, there was nothing on the air in most American cities. If you yearned for something to watch, you were out of luck.<br />The television listings in daily newspapers reflected this. Ohio’s Marion Star of May 15, 1954, noted that at 7 a.m. on Channel 6 there was “No Program.” The Indianapolis Star of June 29, 1957, announced the 7 a.m. offerings of Channels 4, 6 and 8 as “Silent.” The Tampa Tribune on May 4, 1958, advised readers that at 6:30 a.m. Channel 13 was “Off the Air,” and that at 6:45 a.m. Channel 8 was featuring “Test Pattern.”</td>

      <td>Trouble follows when insular guilds—bankers, doctors, journalists—fail to take into account the viewpoints and folkways of non-elite people.</td>
      <td>When Donald Trump—gaudy and braggadocious—used the word “bigly” in a presidential debate with Hillary Clinton in September 2016, the newsroom of the Financial Times dissolved into merriment. Gillian Tett was there, and she heard herself laugh with the others. The word, she writes, sounded odd. “It was not the type of ‘proper’ English of the sort that presidents were supposed to use or that journalists employed every day.”<br />Ms. Tett, who heads the FT’s American editorial board, is the author of “Anthro-Vision,” a book about how anthropology—a subject in which she has a Ph.D. from Cambridge University—can explain the folkways (and speech habits) of non-elite people to professionals trapped in the insularity of their own guilds. The latter’s specialist tools are notably inadequate, she says, when “used without an awareness of culture and context”—without an awareness, that is, of the Big Picture.<br />How can male tech-geeks in California design computerized fridges for use around the world when they don’t know the shopping patterns of housewives in Kuala Lumpur or Johannesburg? How would Western medics combat the highly infectious Ebola virus without accounting for the intimate mourning rituals of Guinea and Sierra Leone?<br />Our professionals are curled up inside silos, Ms. Tett observes. Bankers think only like bankers, economists like economists, doctors like doctors, techies like techies. They lack “lateral vision,” she writes, without which they commit blunders of policy and perception that are often as egregious as they are avoidable.<br />Ms. Tett claims that anthropology—with its empathy for strangers, its principles of listening to someone else’s view, its emphasis on seeing “what is hidden in plain sight”—is an antidote to tunnel vision. Her book, in effect, calls for the anthropologization of the work-sphere (my ugly phrase, not hers). She comes pretty close to asserting that a field that arose in the 19th century to help the imperial West confirm the “inferiority” of colonized people, and that changed in the mid-20th century into the polar opposite of its colonizing origins, is a panacea for our present-day ills. Some may find this claim too sweeping; others will be swept along by her enthusiasm.</td>

This sends the right message to managers. It directs capital to its most highly valued uses. It makes the world safe for indexers.<br />So congrats to  AMC  Entertainment chief executive Adam Aron, who has been playing the role normally filled by short sellers. He’s been selling hand over fist that which appears to be grossly overvalued, namely his own company’s shares thanks to Reddit-dwellers who’ve bid them up in seeming defiance of any business logic.<br />With the stock up an improbable 2,650% since Jan. 1, AMC sold 20 million shares in two tranches in three days last week for an average price of around $41. For comparison’s sake, the Wall Street consensus stock price forecast a year from now is a bit more than $5.<br />Mr. Aron has been loquacious and opportunistic where the management of another “meme” stock,  GameStop ,  has been nervously reticent. With an eye obviously toward the Securities and Exchange Commission, he has been careful not to justify the current stock price. He dances around the motives of online traders who style themselves “apes,” after the rebellious simians in the “Planet of . . .” movies, and who say they want to drive the stock “to the moon” out of animus toward hedge funds that engage in short selling.<br />Mr. Aron has restricted his burble to the ways AMC might use their cash to reinvent itself, while leaving it to public filings to point out the obvious: The current share price reflects “market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business” and investors should be prepared to lose “all or a substantial portion” of their money.</td>

      <td>As public concern about the pandemic continues to decline, the Biden administration is pushing hard to meet its goal of vaccinating 70% of adults with at least one shot by the Fourth of July. More than 60% of the country is already vaccinated.<br />Still, reaching that goal will be challenging. Monthly surveys by the Kaiser Family Foundation show that about 20% of the population was staunchly opposed to getting vaccinated at the beginning of the year and remains so today. As the share of Americans who say they are in “wait and see” mode has declined to only 12% from 31% in January, the pool of new possibilities has shrunk. Mass-inoculation centers are being phased out in favor of a strategy bringing shots to trusted messengers—such as the new campaign to organize 1,000 barbershops in black neighborhoods.<br />As vaccine fears have eased and access has improved, the principal remaining obstacle to near-universal vaccination is the large number of Republicans who are declining to participate.<br />The partisan gap is astonishing. More than 80% of Democrats have already received at least one shot, compared with 49% of Republicans. Twenty-seven percent of Republicans say that they won’t get vaccinated under any circumstances, and an additional 9% will do so only if required. The comparable figures for Democrats are 3% outright refusal and 3% only if required.<br />In November, Joe Biden carried all 20 of the states that now have the highest vaccination rates, while Donald Trump carried 17 of the 20 states with the lowest rates. Recent research finds a similar pattern in House districts.</td>

      <td>A lawsuit says the ordering and delivery platforms levy charges beyond what New York City law allows</td>
      <td>A company behind a Manhattan bakery has filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against major third-party ordering and delivery platforms, including  Grubhub Inc.,   DoorDash Inc.  and Uber Eats, saying they have billed it and other food businesses more than allowed by New York City law.<br />In the lawsuit, Micheli & Shel, the company that operates the Michaeli Bakery on the Lower East Side, says the platforms have routinely levied fees beyond the city-imposed caps that were put into place last year as a way to help restaurants and similar establishments during the Covid-19 pandemic. The caps limit the charges to 15% for delivery and 5% for other fees, based on a customer’s order.<br />It is “a blatant violation of the law,” said Lee N. Jacobs, an attorney who represents Micheli & Shel. He said other businesses plan to join the suit if it becomes a class action. The case was filed earlier this week in federal court in Manhattan.<br />Grubhub said, “We look forward to responding to these baseless allegations.” DoorDash said it “has always supported restaurants, and claims to the contrary are simply wrong.”<br />Uber Eats, which is  Uber Technologies Inc.’s  food-delivery division, declined to comment.</td>

Boeing is expected to seek more than $500 million in additional government funding for the two modified 747 jumbo jets because of an increase in costs related to the Covid-19 pandemic and a supplier’s bankruptcy, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />An Air Force spokesman said Boeing hasn’t formally requested additional funding. Ms. Costello said Boeing has told the Air Force it intended to submit such a request. Boeing declined to comment.<br />“This is a disappointment to all of us,” said Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of a House Armed Services subcommittee.</td>

Joe Manchin made clear he opposed both the current bill and any imminent move to weaken Republicans’ power to block legislation.<br />“We’re open to changes and modifications as long as it does the job,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.).

Manchin and they’re continuing.”<br />The voting measure touches on nearly every aspect of the election system, from how districts are drawn, to how campaigns are financed, to how voters register and verify their eligibility.<br />Mr. Schumer spoke after Senate Democrats met behind closed doors at a weekly lunch at which the impasse was a central topic. Mr. Manchin has called the current bill, the For the People Act or S-1, too partisan and said any changes to election law should have support from both parties. He missed the gathering, and a Manchin spokeswoman said he had a conflicting meeting.<br />Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), the Democratic whip, said members had a candid conversation during Tuesday’s lunch. “There’s a lot of strong feelings about that bill,” he said, adding that most members felt it was necessary and popular. “But we’re waiting to see how Sen. Manchin is going to react.”</td>

About 18 million votes were cast in Sunday’s election.<br />Outstanding votes include those from Peruvians living abroad, which favor Ms. Fujimori, and rural votes, which favor Mr. Castillo. There are also about 250,000 votes that need to be reviewed by electoral courts before being included in the tally, political analysts say. Those ballots were contested by campaigns or had technical issues.<br />Alfredo Torres, head of pollster Ipsos Peru, said most of those votes appear to be from areas where Ms. Fujimori won, suggesting she could narrow the gap.<br />“We don’t know if it will be enough to overtake him…it’s most likely that Castillo stays ahead,” said Mr. Torres. “With luck, we’ll know next week.”</td>

      <td>The 9-and-a-half-hour film, set in wartime Japan, gets a digital restoration from the Criterion Collection that underscores its tragic dimensions.</td>
      <td><br /><br />Japanese cinema has historically been rife with epic tales inspired by literature, many set in the distant past. But none has attained the overwhelming emotional impact of Masaki Kobayashi’s “The Human Condition,” based on a six-volume novel by Jumpei Gomikawa and running 91/2  hours on screen. The film took some four years to complete and was first released in three installments of two parts each between 1959 and 1961. In 2009, the Criterion Collection brought it all to DVD, and the company has just  upgraded it to Blu-ray in a high-definition digital restoration on three discs.<br />Despite the presence of clashing armies, feudal discipline and questions of honor, “The Human Condition” is no samurai or swordplay film, but rather a crushing indictment of Japanese militarism and imperialism during the 1940s. Gomikawa’s sprawling novel appeared only a year before Kobayashi began his adaptation, yet the material spoke to the filmmaker—he co-wrote the screenplay with Zenzo Matsuyama—in a singular way.<br />Like Kaji, the protagonist in both novel and film, Kobayashi regarded himself as a pacificist and a socialist. And also, like Kaji, he was forced to join the army during World War II; didn’t pursue a rank higher than private, though he could have; and was made a prisoner of war near the conflict’s end.</td>

      <td>In this six-part French thriller, a journalist and a psychiatrist team up to investigate a series of human combustions.</td>
      <td>Watching the six-part, French-made psychological thriller “Moloch,” I kept thinking about “The Book of Lists” by David Wallechinsky, Irving Wallace and Amy Wallace, a compendium of esoterica first published in 1977 and the ancestor of internet searches and listicles. Among its cataloging of bizarre phenomena, opinions and obscure facts (the worst movies ever, the world’s best reference works, celebrities who died during sex, various people suspected of being Jack the Ripper) was a list that always stuck with me: eight instances of spontaneous human combustion. People who apparently just burst into flames. As they do in “Moloch.”<br />The idea of spontaneous combustion simply doesn’t dawn on anyone until late in episode 2—oddly no one in the north French city where “Moloch” is set seems to have ever heard of the notion before an alarming number of citizens start going off like Molotov cocktails. I guess they didn’t read the book.<br />SHC is certainly the sort of thing that would turn up among the exhaustive internet searches done by Louise (Marine Vacth), a pathologically ambitious newspaper freelancer who is supposed to be writing “trend” pieces but becomes obsessed with the flambéd-people story—partly because it’s being covered up by the authorities. She is in the habit, she tells her journalist colleagues, of visiting random crime scenes “for ideas,” and has actually sneaked onto the site of what appears to be the first in a series of—what? Suicides? Pyromaniacal attacks? Supernatural conflagrations? Possibly. But we have already seen what was there to be seen: a man simply going to work in a high-rise office tower who caught fire for no discernible reason. Louise, though promptly ejected by police, has managed to photograph the ashy outline of the victim—if that’s what he is—and taken the story back to what is an understandably skeptical newsroom.<br />The word “Moloch”—a Canaanite idol mentioned in the Old Testament and associated with sacrifice—begins appearing at the sites of the combustions. What is causing all the incandescence is the point of the story, supernaturally, but it’s not the dead and gone who keep our attention but the living and the weird. As created by Marion Festraëts and Arnaud Malherbe (who also directs) the characters regularly defy expectations, and clichés: Louise is not the intrepid reporter typical of so many investigative dramas but a borderline sociopath who really will do anything for a story—blackmailing witnesses, exploiting the vulnerable, sleeping with policemen and inveigling her way into the funeral of the first victim. There, she presents herself to the dead man’s psychiatrist, Gabriel (Olivier Gourmet), as a mourner in need of therapy. Gabriel has his own problems, and secrets, that separate him from the pack. But he’s not an idiot, as Louise will find out.<br />All around them—at the newspaper, for instance—are people who refuse to believe their eyes, or Louise, or the irrefutable fact that people are burning up for reasons otherworldly. Gabriel knows better. He begins treating a young boy who saw his mother catch fire. At the same time, he is counseling Jimmy (Marc Zinga), a bus driver who was hospitalized after he went rogue, left his route and drove his passengers to the sea. He has no idea why he did it. But his religious fanaticism together with the invocations of Moloch suggest some kind of divine intervention is at work.</td>

Alleged members of international criminal organizations adopted the platform as a means to communicate securely, unaware that authorities were covertly monitoring 27 million messages from more than 12,000 users across more than 100 countries, officials said.<br />The takedown involved more than 9,000 law-enforcement offices around the world that had searched 700 locations in the previous 48 hours alone, U.S. and European officials said early Tuesday. Police forces had in recent days carried out more than 800 arrests in 16 countries and seized more than 8 tons of cocaine, 22 tons of cannabis and 2 tons of synthetic drugs, as well as 250 firearms, 55 luxury vehicles and over $48 million in various currencies. More than 150 threats to human life were also disrupted, officials said.<br />In the U.S., the FBI charged 17 foreign nationals operating in places including Australia, the Netherlands and Spain with distributing encrypted Anom communications devices, saying they violated federal racketeering laws typically used to target organized-crime groups, officials said. Eight of those individuals are in custody and nine remain at large, they said.</td>

The warning comes as new challenges emerge for the two-year-old company that is trying to convert a former  General Motors Co.  plant in Ohio to produce electric pickup trucks. It has said its first model, the Endurance, will start production in September.<br />Lordstown Motors Chief Executive Steve Burns said on a call with analysts in late May that the startup would need to raise more capital to hit its target of building 2,200 pickup trucks by year-end. The company said at the time that higher-than-expected costs were accelerating its cash burn and that it would finish the year with between $50 million and $75 million on hand.<br />The company was among a number of new electric-vehicle startups that went public last year through reverse mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Lordstown Motors raised $675 million from its reverse merger last fall, a deal that valued the aspiring truck maker at about $1.6 billion.<br />The company didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.</td>

      <td>Senate Republicans have been trying to persuade President Joe Biden to accept a scaled-down version of his new spending plans. Given the tax hikes he intends to go along with them, a new report suggests that scaling the Biden “infrastructure” plan down to zero might be the best outcome for U.S. workers. The Tax Foundation reports the results of its analysis:<br />What kind of a “jobs” plan results in fewer jobs? The Tax Foundation released its analysis on Friday, the same day that Mr. Biden was trying to explain why the latest U.S. employment report from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics fell short of expectations.<br />“Remember, when I took office in January, our economy was in a tailspin,” said the President in what has become his favorite falsehood. Mr. Biden uttered these words eight days after his own Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. real gross domestic product “increased at an annual rate of 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2021.”<br />Now the Tax Foundation report suggests that Mr. Biden may be telling even taller tales about our economic future. Among the notable aspects of this analysis is that it largely accepts Beltway economic assumptions and essentially gives the President the benefit of the doubt that, despite his history, much of the money really will fund useful infrastructure. According to the Tax Foundation report:<br />The White House doesn’t seem to understand that most productivity-enhancing infrastructure is built by business, and when corporate taxes rise, businesses have an incentive to build less of it. The Tax Foundation explains that government spending giveth less investment than the new taxes would taketh away:</td>

      <td>“Cities, States Wage Battle Over Banning Gas in Homes” (Page One, June 1) raises the prospect that policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions will lead to stranded gas assets and higher costs for remaining gas customers. The fear is that as more ratepayers switch to cleaner options than natural gas, the small number of ratepayers who remain will have to shoulder the cost of the entire gas system. It doesn’t have to be that way, however, if gas utilities are given a role to play in a future of clean heating and cooling.<br />In Massachusetts, pilot projects are underway in which gas utilities—using their existing expertise, workforce, rights of way and customer relationships—will install geothermal grids that provide heating and cooling to entire neighborhoods. I filed legislation that builds on these pilot projects by establishing a regulatory framework that facilitates a rapid, orderly and equitable transition away from natural gas and toward these renewable geothermal grid systems. The bill empowers gas companies to lead the transition and creates incentives to ensure that it is in their financial interest to do so.<br />By involving gas utilities in the transition to cleaner forms of heating and cooling, we can reduce emissions while also preventing the dislocation of gas workers and avoiding an untenable situation where there are fewer and fewer ratepayers to support the gas system. Ultimately, the path to net-zero emissions will be much smoother if we can align the goals of climate activists with the business incentives of utilities that currently provide gas, but might one day provide renewable geothermal energy.<br />Sen.

      <td>Regarding the May 25 letter from the American Clean Power Association’s CEO Heather Zichal: Communities seldom know what they are accepting. As an energy-law attorney in upstate New York, I have reviewed many wind-turbine leases presented to landowners. Every one of them contained a confidentiality clause that would make the CIA proud. Typically the lease bars the landowner from disclosing anything about the lease. These clauses are anticompetitive, intimidating (injunctive relief and attorney fees) and entirely one-sided. They prevent landowners from discussing rents and other lease terms with other landowners, municipal officials and the press, effectively trapping the landowner in a take-it-or-leave-it black box of silence and ignorance.<br />Ms. Zichal’s unsupported assertion that the exponential growth is attributable to communities’ desire to site these behemoths, which can range up to 650 feet (and sometimes beyond), on their property ignores the corporate welfare of subsidized rates, the investment tax credit and production tax credit from the U.S. Treasury, the states’ tax credits, the real-property tax abatements required by state law, the grants of up to 50% of the construction materials and labor from some states such as New York, state siting laws that override local laws and the lax enforcement of state environmental rules (if any), which together leave little room for anything but acceptance. Lastly, the reputedly steady income from the leases will last only so long as this subsidy bubble doesn’t burst.<br />Christopher Denton<br />Elmira, N.Y.</td>

Following a 32% jump in the share price Monday, more than 720 million shares traded on Tuesday, nearly a 45-fold increase from Friday.<br />Clover Health went public Jan. 8 by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, run by venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya. Founded in 2013 by healthcare entrepreneur Vivek Garipalli and based in Nashville, Tenn., it provides private health insurance and Medicare plans in eight U.S. states.<br />The firm came under pressure several weeks later after Hindenburg Research put out a report alleging that it misled investors, which Clover Health’s management disputed. SPACs have since fallen out of favor among investors as inflation concerns spurred a shift away from growth stocks and many have seen sizable declines.<br />Some Reddit users are speculating that Clover Health could be the next short squeeze, which is characterized by a high level of its shares being sold short. In this case, if the share price rises significantly, some investors might be forced to buy the stock to cover their short positions, which could accelerate upward momentum.</td>

Mr. Macron leans in for a greeting, placing one hand on the arm of a man wearing a green T-shirt.<br />The man then shouts “Montjoie Saint-Denis! Down with Macrony!” as he winds up and appears to slap Mr. Macron’s face, causing the president’s head to jerk to one side.<br />Mr. Macron’s security service quickly intervened, pushing the man to the ground and pulling the president away. Two men were immediately detained by police, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said. A spokesman for the presidency said the man tried to slap Mr. Macron but declined to provide further details.<br />“Montjoie Saint-Denis” is a royal battle cry that dates back to the 11th or 12th century. It is still used in France as a motto by some far-right groups. “Macrony” is a term used by the president’s opponents to describe Mr. Macron and his allies.</td>

      <td>Hospitals, state health departments and the federal government are racing to decide how to use up millions of   Johnson & Johnson ’s  Covid-19 vaccine doses that are set to expire this month.<br />The prospect of so many doses going to waste in the U.S. when developing nations are desperate for shots would add pressure on the Biden administration to share stockpiled vaccines. But there are few practical solutions to administering them quickly in the U.S. or distributing them in time to foreign countries, according to those involved in the vaccination drive.<br />The stockpile is, in part, an unintended consequence of the U.S.’s decision in April to temporarily suspend administration of J&J doses to assess a rare blood-clot risk. The pause forced states and providers to cancel large blocks of appointments that were never rescheduled, leaving a surplus of supply, and in some areas increasing hesitancy over the J&J vaccine’s safety, according to industry officials.<br />Some hospitals and states say that vaccines from  Pfizer Inc.  and partner  BioNTech SE ,  as well as  Moderna Inc.,  are due to expire later this summer, but the stockpiles so far are largely of J&J doses. Pfizer’s vaccine expires six months after manufacture. Moderna’s vaccine can remain frozen for up to six months, during which it can be refrigerated for one month.<br />Philadelphia has 42,000 J&J doses set to expire, most of which came from a Federal Emergency Management Agency clinic at the city’s convention center a few days before the pause, a city spokesman said. Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Ohio and Arkansas are among states that report having thousands of J&J doses set to expire this month and have been unable to redistribute them.</td>

      <td>LONDON—A British police officer pleaded guilty Tuesday to the kidnap and rape of Sarah Everard, a marketing executive whose murder earlier this year in London sparked protests over violence toward women.<br />Ms. Everard went missing in March after leaving a friend’s apartment and her remains were later found in a wooded area southeast of the capital. An officer with London’s Metropolitan Police, 48-year-old Wayne Couzens, was charged with Ms. Everard’s kidnapping and murder.<br />During a London court hearing on Tuesday Mr. Couzens pleaded guilty to raping and kidnapping the 33-year-old marketing executive, the Associated Press reported. Speaking via video link from prison, Mr. Couzens told the court he accepted responsibility for Ms. Everard’s death but didn’t enter a plea on the murder charge, the AP added. A further hearing is scheduled for next month.<br />Last week the Metropolitan Police said a postmortem of Ms. Everard’s body showed she had died of compression to the neck.<br />Ms. Everard’s death triggered an outpouring of anger from women across the U.K. Many took to social media to recount their own experiences of harassment and abuse, and some held online vigils. Hundreds of people including Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge and wife of Prince William, attended a vigil in south London. The police were subsequently criticized for breaking up the vigil on Covid-19 health grounds and arresting young women who attended the event. An independent government review later found the police didn’t act inappropriately.</td>

      <td>People are quitting their jobs like never before. That could be a long-run positive.</td>
      <td>Employers aren’t only struggling to hire new workers, they look as if they are having a hard time hanging onto the workers they already have.<br />The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that as of the last day of April there were a seasonally adjusted 9.3 million unfilled job openings at U.S. employers, up from 8.3 million a month earlier. That put the job opening rate—job openings as a share of filled and unfilled positions—at a record 6%.<br />The report underscores the difficulties companies have had staffing up as the Covid-19 crisis has eased. But it also showed that employers made 6.1 million hires, which would be a record if not for the four-month period following the shutting down of the economy in April last year, when many people went back to their old jobs.<br />However, those hires were almost entirely offset by 5.8 million job separations, 4 million of which were people quitting their jobs. That took the quits rate, or quits as a share of employment, to a record 2.7%.<br />The upshot is that all the usual explanations for why job growth over the past couple of months has been underwhelming—that child-care issues or extended unemployment benefits or ongoing worries about Covid have held people back from taking jobs—while partially true, may also be incomplete. A lot of workers are also seeking out opportunities elsewhere, leaving their old bosses with another job to fill.</td>

      <td>Studies show it’s durable and widespread. If you’ve had Covid, you can get by with one shot of vaccine.</td>
      <td>The news about the U.S. Covid pandemic is even better than you’ve heard. Some 80% to 85% of American adults are immune to the virus: More than 64% have received at least one vaccine dose and, of those who haven’t, roughly half have natural immunity from prior infection. There’s ample scientific evidence that natural immunity is effective and durable, and public-health leaders should pay it heed.<br />Only around 10% of Americans have had confirmed positive Covid tests, but four to six times as many have likely had the infection. A February study in Nature used antibody screenings in late summer 2020 to estimate there had been seven times as many actual cases as confirmed cases. A similar study, by the University of Albany and New York State Department of Health, revealed that by the end of March 2020—the first month of New York’s pandemic—23% of the city’s population had antibodies. That share necessarily increased as the pandemic spread.<br />The contribution of natural immunity should speed up the timeline for returning fully to normal. With more than 8 in 10 adults protected from either contracting or transmitting the virus, it can’t readily propagate by jumping around in the population. In public health, we call that herd immunity, defined broadly on the Johns Hopkins Covid information webpage as “when most of a population is immune.” It’s not eradication, but it’s powerful.<br />Without accounting for natural immunity, we are far from Anthony Fauci’s stated target of 70% to 85% of the population becoming immune through full vaccination. But the effect of natural immunity is all around us. The plummeting case numbers in late April and May weren’t the result of vaccination alone, and they came amid a loosening of both restrictions and behavior.<br />In Los Angeles, 45% of city residents were found to have antibodies in February. Once vaccines were introduced, the seven-day average of daily Covid cases fell from a peak of more than 15,000 on Jan. 11 to 253 four months later, even as people became more mobile. That sharp decline, which came far faster than health officials expected, can’t be accounted for by vaccination rates, which were below 50% during that time.</td>

      <td>Citibank’s errant billion-dollar payment leads to a ruling that could upset commercial law.</td>
      <td>‘Finders keepers, losers weepers” is something you expect to hear in a schoolyard, not a courtroom. But a federal judge effectively delivered that message to Citibank recently. The bank administered a loan of some $1 billion, sending payments from  Revlon  to the lenders. Citibank mistakenly sent a wire transfer of the entire principal amount due when it only intended a single installment.<br />Under established law, the money that Citibank wired should be repaid because it was sent by mistake. But U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman upset settled law and allowed lenders to keep the money on the ground that the recipients did not have notice that the funds had been sent erroneously. If that became the rule, it would upset the important relationships among lenders, borrowers and trusted intermediaries.<br />Some lenders who received the erroneous payments respected principles of basic fairness, as well as longstanding commercial practice and law, and returned almost one-half of the money to its rightful owner. The others took the novel position that since Revlon owed the funds eventually, they should be allowed to keep it. Never mind that Citibank didn’t owe any money at all—or that Revlon wasn’t due to pay off the entire loan for another three years.<br />Mistakes happen all the time, in financial markets as elsewhere in life. There are protocols for dealing with mistakes. If I wake up one morning and find an extra $100,000 in my bank account, I must allow the bank to reclaim it. If I withdraw and spend it, I can be held civilly liable—or even criminally if I know the money isn’t mine.<br />Mistakes like this occur with surprising frequency. In 2017, the German bank KfW mistakenly transferred $5.4 billion to lenders. In China, the bank Rural Commercial Bank in Changsha thought that a customer’s 10-digit account number was actually the amount of money to be transferred, and mistakenly sent 1.2 billion yuan (around $190 million) to the customer.  Deutsche Bank  recently sent $6 billion to a U.S.-based hedge fund in error. In all these cases, the banks recovered the errant funds transfers almost immediately.</td>

      <td>Angling off North Carolina’s Hatteras Island isn’t a lazy man’s sport. The oldest fishing charter in the region regularly delivers the thrill of the hunt.</td>
      <td>CAPTAIN BRYAN Mattingly showed me how to stand. Shoulders upright, knees bent, core tight. He wanted me to smile, too. I found this hard to do while perched atop the cabin at the narrow bow of the Albatross—a 43-foot-long, prewar fishing boat. We were just off the coast of Hatteras Island, N.C. Nothing secured me to the bow except my own two feet. If I stumbled while casting a fishing rod that was twice my height, I’d plunge into the cold, green Atlantic Ocean, where I was certain sharks circled below the surface.<br />Hatteras is an essential destination for saltwater anglers. The barrier island’s iconic cape, or easternmost point, juts out right near where the warm Gulf Stream collides with the cold Labrador Current, creating a nutrient-rich environment for fish. Many boats can be hired on the island, particularly in the village of Hatteras (pop. 511). However, none possesses the history of the Albatross Fleet, the longest-running charter fishing operation in the Outer Banks, and the knowledge of the captains associated with its three custom-built boats.<br />After I’d practiced casting, Captain Mattingly turned north in search of cobia, a long, dark fish sort of resembling a shark that migrates past the island every year. It was a sunny morning, the water clear for mid-May. Good fishing conditions. Unlike most customers though, I cared little about what exactly we caught. I wanted more to feel transported by experiencing a living piece of the area’s maritime past.<br />In 1936, Ernal Foster designed the Albatross—a round-stern beauty made of heart pine and what Bankers call juniper wood—and named it after the ominous bird in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.” Several years prior, the construction of a bridge across Currituck Sound to Kitty Hawk had made the Outer Banks more accessible to mainlanders. It was almost two more decades before a completed paved road connected Hatteras Island with its neighbors to the north.<br />Still, whether by ferry or tire ruts worn in the sand, intrepid travelers found their way to the island and its southernmost village. Once there, some started offering to pay local fishermen—like Ernal and his brother, Bill—to take them rod-and-reel fishing for blue marlin, mahi-mahi, which Bankers call dolphin, and other saltwater species. Locals laughed at the notion of seeking pleasure in what they knew as hard work. Who’d fish with a rod-and-reel when you could use a more efficient net? The Fosters were happy to oblige visitors and, thanks to some well-publicized blue marlin catches, became renowned for their expertise and fine wooden boats.</td>

Gov. Justin Fairfax; and state lawmakers Lee Carter and Jennifer McClellan. Mr. McAuliffe has coalesced support of leading Democrats in Richmond, where the party hopes to retain complete control of government after a cache of victories since 2017.<br />Mr. McAuliffe, who left office in January 2018 because the state prohibits consecutive gubernatorial terms, ran by leaning into his prior tenure, and he proposed higher funding for education and police. “We need experience now to lead us out of this very tough crisis,” he said during a Democratic debate last month.<br />Democrats are favored in the November matchup between Mr. Youngkin, the former co-chief executive of the Carlyle Group Inc., and the winner of Tuesday’s contest. However, Republicans and some Democrats say the GOP could have an opening if enough Democrats stay home and suburbanites across party lines start to turn on the party. And Mr. McAuliffe, if pronounced the winner, faces an early test in keeping all elements of his party energized.<br />As was the case during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, when Joe Biden faced tough criticism from rivals before quickly consolidating support, a diverse field of candidates, some of them newer to politics, have struggled to combat the longtime front-runner’s name recognition and goodwill within the party. As the race drew to a conclusion, Democrats of all stripes expressed a sense of inevitability around the outcome.</td>

      <td>Bank of England will measure the resilience of U.K. banks and insurers under three climate-change scenarios</td>
      <td>The Bank of England launched a program to assess the ability of lenders and insurers to withstand risks such as rising sea levels, flooding, cyclones and wildfires, in the latest step by a central bank to scrutinize the impact of climate change.<br />The U.K.’s biggest banks, including  HSBC Holdings  PLC and  Barclays  PLC, and insurers such as the U.K. units of  American International Group Inc.  and parts of Lloyd’s of London, will estimate how their businesses will perform in the next 30 years based on three different scenarios in which governments and companies either take early, late or no action to mitigate climate change.<br />The tests represent the latest step by central banks and financial regulators to look at climate change when assessing the health of financial institutions. Regulators have traditionally used similar “stress tests” to measure the resilience of lenders to adverse economic scenarios such as deep recessions, rises in interest rates or trade wars.<br />Many central bankers now see climate change as part of that mix, potentially leading to loan losses or higher inflation because of supply disruptions. Rising sea levels can endanger the value of an asset, such as a hotel, that is collateral for a loan. Floods caused by climate change can disrupt supply chains, leading to losses on loans and investments to corporations.<br />The Bank of England’s program will see lenders model the impact of climate change on loan losses and insurers, to assess how the value of assets and liabilities will change.</td>

      <td>A string of mass shootings over the past three months as the U.S. re-opened from the pandemic was one of the worst on record, and law-enforcement officials are fearful of more to come.<br />There were five attacks in which four or more people were killed in public places from March through May, matching the highest three-month total going back to 1966, according to the Violence Project, a mass-shooting database run by two criminology professors.<br />For almost exactly a year, as Covid gripped the country, there were no shootings that killed four or more people in public places, according to the project. Then on March 16, a 21-year-old fatally shot eight people at spas in the Atlanta area. That attack was followed by mass shootings at a Colorado supermarket, a Southern California office building, an Indianapolis FedEx  facility, and a San Jose, Calif., railyard. A total of 39 people were killed.<br />Law-enforcement officials and threat-assessment professionals say possible factors behind the recent spate of mass shootings include the growth in public gatherings as the Covid-19 threat has eased, the stress of the pandemic on Americans’ mental health and record sales of guns last year.<br />“We’ve got people that have been sitting around for over a year with nothing but time to plan; all they need is that point that pushes them over toward violence,” said Mike Sena, director of the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, a federal law-enforcement hub that identifies threats in the region and shares information with local law enforcement. “There’s been people that have had a lot of angst, there’s a lot of people who’ve been acquiring a lot of weapons.”</td>

She has reached the French Open quarterfinals by powering through three victories and a walkover. And by now, she has spent more time in Paris engaged in daily games of UNO with her parents than playing in tennis matches.<br />To Gauff, it’s a sure sign of one thing: at 17, she’s beginning to feel like a professional. Her results in Paris have all been “straightforward wins, like no crazy three sets and stuff,” she said. “As we know, I have had a lot of those in the past.”<br />Nearly half of Gauff’s 16 matches in the main draws of major tournaments before this French Open have gone the distance and exposed her inexperience. In her most recent trip to a major-tournament fourth round—at the Australian Open in 2020—Gauff took the first set against fellow American Sofia Kenin, only to lose the next two 6-3 and 6-0 and walk off in tears.<br />Two years later, Gauff is already showing signs of becoming more clinical. All three of her wins here have come in straight sets.<br />“I think that you can tell that I’m improving and making smarter decisions on the court,” she said.</td>

Greg Abbott on May 31 gave state officials 90 days to end state licenses for any child-welfare shelters where the federal government has been housing the immigrant children after they cross the border. There are 52 such shelters in Texas—about a quarter the total around the country—and they collectively house approximately 5,000 children, according to a Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman.<br />Under immigration law, the federal government is responsible for caring for unaccompanied immigrant children—defined as migrants under 18 who crossed the border without a parent—in state-licensed shelters until it can find a suitable adult guardian to care for them.<br />In a letter to Mr. Abbott and other Texas officials sent Monday evening, HHS Deputy General Counsel Paul Rodriguez wrote that moving ahead with stripping the licenses from federal immigration facilities would interfere with the federal government’s exclusive control over immigration matters.<br />“Although we prefer to resolve this matter amicably, in light of the legal issues outlined above, HHS is consulting the U.S. Department of Justice and intends to pursue whatever appropriate legal action is necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the vulnerable youth that Congress entrusted to [HHS],” he wrote.</td>

The bank provides loans and technical advice to developing and emerging economies.<br />While about 90% of advanced economies are expected to regain their pre-pandemic per capita income levels by 2022, only about one-third of emerging-market and developing nations are likely to do so, the bank said, in part because of uneven access to Covid-19 vaccines.<br />The Covid-ravaged global economy shrank an estimated 3.5% in 2020, the bank said. While the rebound is forecast to continue next year with growth of  4.3%, the level of output will remain 2% below pre-pandemic projections.</td>

The incumbent enjoys widespread support among right-wing and religious voters, and he and his allies have tried to rally that base to pressure some right-wing lawmakers to abandon the new coalition.<br />The defection of just one or two lawmakers could prevent the new coalition from mustering a majority and force Israel’s fifth election since 2019.</td>

That approach is mixed with acceptance that Congress will pass some significant tax increases and tempered by hope that it won’t.<br />“Our clients are resigned to the fact that taxes will go up,” said Helena Jonassen, a partner at  Evercore Inc.’s  wealth management unit.<br />President Biden has proposed raising the top capital-gains tax rate to 43.4% from 23.8% and taxing appreciated assets at death as if they had been sold. Under current law, appreciated assets held until death escape the income tax. Heirs pay capital-gains taxes only when they sell and only on gains since the prior owner’s death.<br />Tax lawyers are looking at two basic approaches—act now or wait it out.</td>

But Covid-19 upended those plans, causing construction to grind to a halt last spring and leaving a foundation but not much else. More than a dozen contractors have filed liens against the property over unpaid pills, public records show.<br />The ambitious modular hotel’s future now looks uncertain. The owner is trying to raise additional funding to finish the roughly $80 million project, according to a person familiar with the matter. That is proving difficult at a time when many lenders are shying away from hotels, especially in big cities, as the lodging industry continues to suffer from a lack of corporate travel.<br />The project is an important test case for modular construction. The process of building entire rooms in a factory and then stacking them on top of each other at a property site has existed for decades. But it has experienced rising interest in recent years, as developers look for cheaper, faster ways to build amid soaring construction costs.</td>

Maybe the academics should be following Reddit’s  AMC  Entertainment memes, because the movie-theater operator’s maneuver last week to raise $817 million by selling shares into a wild froth—the latest in a series that quintupled its share count since September—adds a third constituency often missing from the theory of the company: the company itself.<br />The most obvious reason for a company to exist is to benefit its shareholders, and on a basic shareholder-value measure AMC has excelled: Its stock is up 2,494% this year. Social-media savvy Chief Executive Adam Aron (who bagged the @CEOAdam handle on Twitter) can take some of the credit, hamming up the stock with free popcorn for shareholders and spending an hour being interviewed by one of the self-styled “apes” who bought AMC and call him their “silverback.”<br />With some twisted logic one could argue AMC was only doing what shareholders really want. Lots of new people want to buy shares (AMC was the most-traded U.S. stock last week), so it is only right that the company should create and sell them. Never mind that AMC, in the prospectus selling the stock, includes an extraordinary boldface warning not to buy it.<br />Taking a more cynical view, one could argue that AMC is acting for the benefit of the shareholders who will remain after the excess evaporates. Sell shares at today’s elevated prices and use it for something useful, like buying distressed sites or paying off debt, and whoever the owners are after the shares fall back will have the assets. No one was obliged to buy the stock, after all. Caveat emptor.</td>

In an effort to strike a compromise between those who protested the closure and those who had cheered the plan, the LME said official prices widely used in physical metal contracts would be determined in the ring. Closing prices used to assess the value of financial portfolios will be calculated electronically.<br />“We can’t be the sole arbiter of the best interests of the market; we must listen to what the market thinks,” said Matthew Chamberlain, the LME’s chief executive.<br />The reversal marks a victory for trading firms that are members of the ring. These dealers had pushed back against the closure, saying that scrapping the pit would make it more difficult to make complex trades that protect clients such as miners against price swings.</td>

The company doesn’t publish its own monthly sales figures and it didn’t respond to questions.<br />In recent weeks Tesla has endured a run of bad publicity over its handling of customer complaints and perceived quality problems, denting its image among Chinese consumers. In an April post on its Weibo social-media account, Tesla assured customers that it takes quality concerns seriously. “If there is a problem with Tesla products, Tesla will absolutely take responsibility,” it said.<br />While Tesla’s reputation has undoubtedly taken a hit, the May sales data suggest many local consumers are sticking with the American EV brand, which started building the Model Y at its Shanghai plant in January and is ramping up deliveries.<br />However, Cui Dongshu, the association’s secretary-general, has warned it may be too early to know how seriously the negative publicity has damaged Tesla since many of the cars being delivered in May would have been ordered before the auto maker’s recent setbacks.</td>

      <td>If you’re an investor, retail trends may matter almost as much as financials this year</td>
      <td>Consumers want to wear real clothes again, but they have apparently forgotten how to dress themselves—presenting a big opportunity for Stitch Fix, which is already enjoying the spoils of sweatpants fatigue.<br />The online styling company brought some big fashion energy to the market on Monday, reporting sales and active clients that topped Wall Street’s estimates for the quarter ended May 1. Fashion-forward investors paying attention to the latest trends in retail should have seen the strong quarter coming. Rent the Runway’s recent data showed demand has been soaring for sexy styles such as crop tops, cut outs and colorful short dresses, whereas two years ago shoppers were reaching for styles described by the company as “expected” and “conservative.”<br />Stitch Fix reported some of the same, with rompers and jumpsuits up 60% year on year and midi dresses up 80% over the same period. If you’re a Stitch Fix investor, retail trends may matter almost as much as financials this year. Consumers aren’t only heading back to work but looking to fulfill a years’ worth of pent-up desire to travel, gather and dress up for big events like weddings and baby showers.<br />In its report on Monday, Stitch Fix said it saw strong demand from first-time and reactivated clients and the company’s second-highest quarter on record for sequential client additions. Guidance for its fourth fiscal quarter came in above analysts’ forecast for revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.<br />Stitch Fix is in the process of a slow but significant makeover. Historically, its clients would receive a surprise shipment of handpicked items from a stylist but are now increasingly able to preview these items before they are shipped. Eliminating the element of surprise has been popular, the company said, and has resulted in higher average order values. Stitch Fix also continues to test “drop shipping” models, where inventory is shipped directly from a brand to a client without Stitch Fix having to hold the inventory. And existing clients are now able to purchase items a la carte, a feature that the company said will be open to all new clients by the end of the current quarter.</td>

      <td>Rewriting the rules on how major companies are taxed could have broad repercussions—depending on how the details play out</td>
      <td>Seven wealthy countries have announced a plan to impose a minimum levy on multinational corporations and rewrite the rules governing how countries tax them, but policy makers around the world will need to make some tough choices before anything actually changes.<br />The Group of Seven nations agreed to a broad framework for changing the global corporate-tax system, rather than a detailed plan. It pairs two related but distinct “pillars.”<br />There are high political and bureaucratic hurdles to adoption of the proposal. Here is a look at some of the factors that will shape any global corporate tax regime.<br />That principle said corporate profits should be taxed where value is generated, which traditionally was where businesses had a physical presence. The rule was easier to follow when profit flowed from factory floors instead of patents and other highly mobile intellectual property.<br />Now the G-7, which comprises of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., is proposing that some profit from some of the biggest companies should be reallocated to countries where their products and services are consumed. Those countries can then tax the reallocated portion of the profit.</td>

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked 0.2% lower. On Monday, the blue-chip index briefly climbed into record territory before ending the session down 0.4%. Nasdaq-100 futures edged up 0.2%, pointing to subdued gains for technology stocks.<br />Stocks have been range bound in recent sessions, with indexes hovering close to record levels due to a rapidly rebounding U.S. economy and significant levels of support from Washington and the Federal Reserve. The market’s moves in recent weeks have moderated amid inflation concerns. Investors say they are settling in for a period of choppy trading while they await fresh clues on whether a sharp rise in consumer prices will prove to be fleeting.<br />“There will be constant gut checks from both the bond and the stock markets on whether this is transitory, or is turning into permanently higher inflation,” said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth Management. “I would still put the odds of a higher S&P 500 at the end of the year as better than 50%, but I think there will be more volatility than return to be had in the second half of the year.”<br />Ahead of the market opening, Tesla rose 3% after data from the China Passenger Car Association showed sales of electric cars in China surged by 177% in May.

      <td>An exit from some global retail markets and a focus on wealth are moves investors should watch closely</td>
      <td>Under new management,  Citigroup  is still aiming to close its performance gap to peers. But how it goes about that may be changing.<br />One of the bank’s first big moves has been to shrink its global retail footprint, moving to exit consumer banking franchises in 13 countries in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. These units weren’t necessarily part of the problem as Citigroup was striving to meet its target of a 12% return on tangible common equity, a measure of profit as a percentage of the bank’s equity capital, before the pandemic. The yearslong drive to boost this key metric tracked by investors succeeded in bringing Citigroup closer to rivals like  Bank of America  and  JPMorgan Chase ,  which boasted equity returns in the mid-to-high teens pre-pandemic.<br />The businesses being exited were allocated just $7 billion worth of tangible common equity on average last year, or less than 5% of the bank’s equity base. This meant they had potential for high returns, or at least weren’t likely to be major drags on capital efficiency as the bank strove to meet its targets.<br />Speaking last Friday at a Bernstein conference, Chief Executive Jane Fraser, who officially took the reins in March, described the international retail units as “good return businesses.” But they also would have required a lot of investment in infrastructure and controls to continue to digitize them and get them to a larger scale. That is an area where Citigroup is already spending a lot of time and money, following a special consent order from U.S. regulators last year that cited deficiencies in risk management, data and internal controls.<br />Ms. Fraser noted that the bank’s efforts to close return gaps with peers must focus not only on what businesses it will give priority to, but how it operates them. She said the bank would rather “monetize” those retail assets and redeploy the resources, either as part of capital return to shareholders or toward higher-return activities.</td>

      <td>The “reopening trade” has posed a real challenge to King Dollar, but there could be a limit to how much power this monarchy is willing to give back.<br />The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, has been on an almost nonstop slide since the start of April. This past week, though, it has stood its ground, despite the fact that U.S. payroll numbers released Friday were weaker than economists expected.<br />It may be a sign that the dollar’s depreciation has largely run its course. If that is the case, it would remove a powerful tailwind from some markets, because asset prices denominated in dollars tend to move to offset shifts in the exchange rate. Commodities, for example, are up 32% in dollar terms since the start of the Covid-19 crisis, but only 17% in euros. As for oil, currently a popular bet, the currency has accounted for about two thirds of its gains.<br />Last year, a dash to safety initially pushed the WSJ Dollar Index up 8% relative to the start of 2020. As fiscal and monetary stimulus was deployed to fight the pandemic, the panic unwound. The move had completely reversed by November, but the dollar kept falling.<br />Anticipation of a synchronized global recovery tends to help shares that trade at cheap levels relative to earnings, which means looking overseas. European stocks have outperformed American ones in 2021.</td>

      <td>Critics of public debt accumulation usually mean well, but in many cases the alternative is steeper borrowing by individuals and companies</td>
      <td>Debt levels rose in almost every corner of the world last year, but how the burden is shared between governments and the private sector varies widely. Some countries may come to wish the mix of borrowers was a little different.<br />In several economies classified as emerging markets—notably Thailand, China, Malaysia, South Korea and Russia—the increase in private nonfinancial debt to gross domestic product ran to more than 10 percentage points in 2020, according to figures released by the Bank for International Settlements Monday. In some, a sharper fall in GDP is doing more of the work in shifting that ratio, but the outcome is the same: more private debt relative to economic output.<br />Emerging markets have typically seen more limited increases in government debt than their developed counterparts. Most countries aren’t in the position of the U.S., U.K. or Japan, which are able to expand state spending rapidly without worrying about undermining the value of their currencies and creating inflationary pressures. In some cases, governments could have taken on more debt, but chose not to.<br />Based on last year’s evidence, though, the inability or unwillingness of states to borrow and spend may have resulted in a more precarious financial position for their private sectors. During a major economic shock such as the pandemic, avoiding a large recession requires some sector or other having to borrow large amounts of money.<br />Of course, government borrowing isn’t a substitute for private borrowing. In most advanced economies, the U.S. included, private debt has risen in the past year. But lower government borrowing will lead either to higher private borrowing or a bigger economic shortfall.</td>

Cobalt and nickel also will be needed for batteries while copper will be used by transmission lines, electric vehicles and wind turbines. “Metals are at the heart of the new economy, they’re key to the transition to new technologies, EVs, energy storage,” said Mark Wade, head of sustainability research at Allianz Global Investors.<br />“For us as an industry, the transition to a decarbonized society and what that means to both demand and supply for our products becomes the defining issue of our time,”  Anglo American  PLC Chief Executive Mark Cutifani said at a recent Bank of America conference.

      <td>Limited inventory of resources is converging with a buying spree to supercharge prices, spurring inflation concerns</td>
      <td>HONG KONG—A yearlong steep climb in commodity prices is testing an economics maxim: High prices cure themselves by spurring supply and quenching demand.<br />Languishing commodity prices led producers to slash capital spending on major resources by nearly half over the last decade, shrinking stocks of industrial metals to two-decade lows and reducing supplies across commodities. The crunch is now converging with a buying spree in key markets to supercharge prices—and there is no quick fix.<br />Since 2011, investments to develop the energy and mining sectors have fallen 40%, according to asset manager Schroders, leaving many producers unprepared for a recent boom in manufacturing and spending in the world’s two largest economies. Prices of resources from corn to lumber to battery metals have risen sharply over the past year, in many cases to twice or more from pre-pandemic levels, aided by low interest rates, a weaker dollar and infrastructure building in the U.S. and China.<br />The consequences of underdeveloped global resources now stoke worries among regulators and companies that producer price inflation—buoyed by demand projections that in key materials stretch decades ahead—is becoming sufficiently broad and prolonged that it spills onto consumer prices. Raw-material shortages sometimes morph into broader market dysfunction that force companies to cut or shut production, as some car makers have done in recent months because of limited semiconductor supply.<br />“It’s not how much it will cost, it’s whether or not you can get it,” said Tai Wong, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “It’s like chips—without it, you can’t sell cars.”</td>

It isn’t quite as eager to see its own opponents at home try the same thing.<br />Ahead of a parliamentary vote later this year, the Kremlin has been fine-tuning its strategy to pressure platforms such as Twitter, YouTube and TikTok to remove antigovernment content, classifying a growing number of posts as illegal and issuing a flurry of takedown requests.<br />So far it appears to be working. The Western-dominated tech giants have in many instances complied. YouTube temporarily removed links to content laying out the opposition’s voting strategy. Russian officials say  Twitter  is working to comply with requests to remove content that Moscow deems illegal. TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance Ltd., also removed or altered a handful of videos that criticized the government and promoted opposition street protests.<br />TikTok, Twitter and Google, the  Alphabet Inc.  subsidiary that owns YouTube, say they decide whether to delete content based on local laws where they operate and on their own internal guidelines. None of the companies commented on specific cases mentioned in this article.<br />September’s election has injected fresh urgency into expanding Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ability to control political debate in the country. Just as he consolidated power early on in his reign by nationalizing television broadcasters or selling them to government-friendly owners, the Kremlin is now turning its attention to the internet, one of the last few refuges of free speech. The move is meant to help the ruling party, United Russia, which has seen its popularity drop amid a steady decline in living standards and is now preparing to bat off any challenge ahead of the elections from supporters of Alexei Navalny, a prominent dissident who is serving a 2½-year prison term.</td>

The once-obscure corner of the market has boomed this year like never before, with many new investors trying their hands during the pandemic shutdowns.<br />The complicated contracts can be risky to use but have mushroomed into a feature of the meme mania this year. Some individual investors have said that they are drawn to the thrill of options trading, happy to take on higher risks for the prospect of big payouts. They have used the bets to turbocharge their positions, eager to ride the relentless momentum in stocks like GameStop and AMC.<br />Call options, which allow investors the right to purchase stocks at a set price in the future, have recorded particularly heavy trading. Internet traders and others have favored them for making bullish bets in pursuit of mammoth gains. Their relatively low cost—with just one contract covering 100 shares—has lured many into the market, with activity rising to a fever pitch in recent sessions.<br />Traders last week spent $11.6 billion on options contracts tied to AMC, more than on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, Invesco QQQ Trust and Tesla Inc. combined, according to  Cboe Global Markets  data.

The gains were led by growing help-wanted ads for jobs in food service, hospitality and tourism and loading and stocking, the latter reflecting the continued strength of online shopping.<br />The number of openings declined last month in construction and plateaued in recent weeks in manufacturing. Those sectors were among the first to return to pre-pandemic levels of openings late last summer. The Indeed data also showed that openings for retail jobs nearly held steady last month after strong gains earlier in the year. The Labor Department will release its accounting of job openings for April at 10 a.m. E.T. on Tuesday.<br />The trends in those sectors suggest that the broad resurgence in demand for labor is reaching a limit in some of the first sectors where demand returned after the pandemic downturn. Conversely, leisure and hospitality, the sector that saw the most jobs lost last year, now has the most growth.<br />“Consumption patterns are changing as the pandemic ebbs, with people shifting spending toward dining out, travel and other services and away from purchases made during the pandemic,” said Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America at Indeed. “That will cause employers’ demand for workers to shift.”</td>

      <td>A once obscure Federal Reserve rate control facility is now holding nearly half a trillion dollars day after day, and the New York Fed’s leader isn’t concerned.<br />Over recent weeks, eligible financial firms, mainly money-market funds, banks and government sponsored entities, have been moving ever larger amounts of money into what the U.S. central bank calls its reverse repo facility.<br />On Monday, just days ahead of the next rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, cash parked on the Fed’s books by these firms hit a record $486 billion. That marks the second time reverse repo activity notched a record in recent weeks, and compares with the last peak on the final day of 2015, when reverse repo volume reached $476 billion.<br />Many market participants have looked at the reverse repo activity with some unease. Financial firms have been willing to take the zero percent the Fed offers them through the facility in large part because there are few other short-term investments available, and in some cases, these private market investments actually cost money to invest in. That makes the Fed’s zero percent repo rate attractive on a relative basis.<br />“The system is working exactly as designed,” New York Fed President John Williams said in a video interview on Yahoo Finance last Thursday. The reverse repo facility, he added, is “working really well and the fact that funds are flowing between the banking system and our overnight reverse repos, this is kind of how we would expect that to happen” given the level of money coursing through short-term markets.</td>

The attack prompted Colonial Pipeline to shut down the 5,500-mile pipeline pumping gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined products from the Gulf Coast to Linden, N.J.<br />On Monday, the Justice Department said authorities had recovered roughly $2.3 million in digital currency paid to the hackers, a suspected Russian gang known as DarkSide.<br />The Colonial stoppage spurred a run on gasoline along parts of the East Coast that pushed prices to the highest levels in more than six years, leaving thousands of gas stations without fuel. The attack has prompted senior Biden administration officials to warn that ransomware represents an elevated national security risk.<br />Mr. Blount told The Wall Street Journal last month that his company paid a $4.4 million ransom to the hackers because executives were unsure how badly the cyberattack had breached its systems.</td>

      <td>Bipartisan Senate report recommends making it easier for the Capitol Police chief to request National Guard assistance, among other actions</td>
      <td>A bipartisan Senate report faulted Capitol security officials as well as federal agencies for intelligence and planning failures leading up to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, and recommended that the Capitol Police chief be able to unilaterally request help from the National Guard in an emergency.<br />The more than 100-page Senate report and its 20 recommendations reflect a bipartisan congressional investigation of the riot, during which supporters of former President Donald Trump temporarily interrupted the ratification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election win. The report doesn’t assess Mr. Trump’s role leading up to and during the riot, which Senate committee aides said was outside the scope of their probe.<br />Mr. Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House earlier this year for inciting insurrection against the U.S. government. He was acquitted by the Senate.<br />“This report is not a comprehensive account of everything that happened in the lead up to and during the attack,” Sen. Gary Peters (D., Mich.), the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, told reporters. He and other Democrats have called for an independent commission to conduct a fuller investigation.<br />One key recommendation is to empower the Capitol Police chief to unilaterally request assistance from the National Guard in an emergency, instead of having to get approval from the Capitol Police Board, a process the report faulted as confusing and cumbersome. Congress would have to pass legislation to make that change. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) and Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) told reporters they would sponsor a bill to do so.</td>

      <td>The Justice Department will move forward with its defense of former President Donald Trump in a defamation suit brought by a journalist over allegations that the former president raped her in the 1990s.<br />In a filing in New York federal court on Monday, the Justice Department signaled that it wouldn’t change position in the case, despite President Biden’s appointees taking control of the department in January.<br />The dispute was sparked after E. Jean Carroll, a longtime advice columnist for Elle magazine, made the allegation in an article published in New York Magazine in 2019. She wrote that in the mid-1990s Mr. Trump pushed her against a dressing-room wall at Bergdorf Goodman in New York and assaulted her.<br />After her allegations appeared in print, Mr. Trump replied: “Number one, she’s not my type. Number two, it never happened.” In response, Ms. Carroll sued the then-president in November 2019, saying he lied earlier that year when he denied raping her.<br />The Justice Department under Mr. Trump intervened last September, asking that the U.S. government be named as the plaintiff rather than Mr. Trump personally. Under existing law, the federal government can’t be sued for defamation, and the Justice Department argued that Mr. Trump was acting within the scope of his duties as president when he denied the allegation.</td>

Mr. Biden said that U.S. intelligence has focused on two scenarios—whether the coronavirus came from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident.<br />People familiar with the study said that it was prepared by Lawrence Livermore’s “Z Division,” which is its intelligence arm. Lawrence Livermore has considerable expertise on biological issues. Its assessment drew on genomic analysis of the SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, they said.<br />Scientists analyze the genetic makeup of viruses to try to determine how they evolved and spread in the population. Proponents on both sides of the debate over the origins of Covid-19 have cited such analysis to try to make their case.</td>

ExtraHop’s customers include  Ulta Beauty Inc.,  Home Depot Inc., Texas Children’s Hospital and Gas South LLC, among others.<br />Ransomware attacks have made headlines in recent months across a range of industries.

He said the company has seen interest in its product more than double in the past three months or so, citing an uptick in requests for more information by potential clients, driven by heightened cyberattack concerns.</td>

But the department continued to bar federal agents from using them, arguing that footage from the devices could jeopardize sensitive investigations.<br />Ms. Monaco’s memo is a reversal of that stance, requiring federal agents to use the cameras in preplanned arrests, such as those of fugitives sought on state and local warrants, and when executing search warrants.</td>

      <td>Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference keynote showed off major updates for FaceTime, AirPods and privacy</td>
      <td>Apple is hosting its annual Worldwide Developers Conference virtually for the second year in a row. I tuned in from home for the Monday keynote, where company execs outlined a slew of new updates for Apple devices due this fall via iOS 15, iPadOS 15, WatchOS 8 and MacOS Monterey.<br />The most exciting announcements are aimed directly at improving our experiences at home, where much of our work and play will continue even after the pandemic. FaceTime will get Zoom-like talents, plus the ability to share videos and music with other video-chat participants. And there are more iOS and watch features designed to increase focus and reduce stress.<br />The event is where Apple historically has expanded its walled garden, by announcing capabilities that will keep customers within its tightly locked hardware-software ecosystem. Sure enough, to get the most out of the newest Mac features, you will need an iPad, an iPhone and maybe even a second Mac. However, the company countered that narrative with a few other announcements: FaceTime now works in web browsers, so you can start up a video chat with people on Windows and Android devices, too. And Siri can be spoken to via other manufacturers’ HomeKit devices (though you will still need to own a HomePod).<br />In any case, the event is a reminder that Apple’s garden can be a pretty nice one. Many changes, available by way of a free software update in the fall, ought to add functionality to aging devices, including the six-year-old iPhone 6S. Some, of course, are reserved for only the newest Apple products. Here’s a breakdown of the most interesting announcements.<br />FaceTime, Apple’s video chat app, is getting features already popular in competitors: blurred backgrounds, grid view for group calls, background-noise reduction, screen sharing and meeting links. The new functionality is available on both iOS and Mac devices. And, for the first time, Android and Windows users can join a FaceTime call via a Chrome or Edge web browser.</td>

      <td>What’s the fun of being the world’s richest person if you can’t fashion a rocket and launch yourself into space? Say what you will about Jeff Bezos, but he’s certainly willing to eat his own cooking. The Journal’s Matt Grossman reports:<br />It will also be a big deal for the winner of a June 12 charity auction, who will be allowed to come along for the ride. The Bezos brothers and their charitable guest can take comfort in the fact that while the craft may have been subjected to relatively few test missions, its performance has been almost perfect. Darrell Etherington at TechCrunch writes that “save for the first flight where the reusable booster was lost, [New Shepard] has had a complete success for each of those 15 missions, including landing of the booster (except that first time) and recovery of the capsule (for all of the launches).”<br />It seems likely that the charity auction winner will enjoy the company. Avery Hartmans at Business Insider notes:<br />Taking the maiden voyage for humans on a vehicle headed 62 miles above sea level, perhaps the brothers will be thinking this is one of those times for the bourbon, and let’s hope for the laughter as well. Back on Earth, more than a few observers will likely be toasting the creativity and guts of one of America’s great entrepreneurs.<br />The moment may also remind a few of those observers of the irony that Mr. Bezos, a sort of living testament to American liberty and American exceptionalism, owns a Beltway newspaper enamored of central planning. Viewed from outer space or here on earth, the Washington Post may look small but its owner’s achievements are not.</td>

      <td>Believe it or not, there’s good news south of the Rio Grande. Mexican voters delivered a sharp rebuke to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s ruling Morena Party coalition in Sunday’s midterm elections, stripping its two-thirds majority in the lower house of Congress. The result weakens AMLO, as the President is known, and his ambitions for a radical “fourth transformation” of Mexico.<br />The President made this election a referendum on himself, betting that his 60% approval rating would overcome his mishandling of Covid-19 and an economy that hasn’t grown in two years. His pledge to fight corruption still resonates with the public.<br />Turnout of about 52% was high for a midterm election. But Morena candidates took a beating among middle-class urban and suburban voters, many of whom supported AMLO in 2018. Morena lost big in the federal district of Mexico City, where AMLO was mayor.<br />Morena or its coalition won 10 or so of the 15 governorships in play, but Morena had to settle for a plurality in the 500-seat lower house. The party will now need cooperation from the Green Party—always a party for hire—to govern. AMLO’s ambition to rewrite the constitution—whether to reverse market liberalization, especially in energy, or centralize power in the presidency—becomes far more difficult.<br />AMLO’s image as the popular caudillo has also taken a hit. He’s still not a lame duck, but halfway through his six-year single term the 2024 election campaign is unofficially open, which means that his power is no longer ascendant. When he assails business as the “mafia,” bullies opponents, or tries to push antidemocratic laws through Congress, he will now meet more resistance.</td>

Credit to Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock for resisting pressure from the public-health left who campaigned against the drug.<br />Aducanumab’s twisted path to approval illustrates the challenges of drug development. Hundreds of experimental Alzheimer’s treatments have failed in clinical trials over decades. While some approved drugs can temporarily mitigate behavioral and cognitive symptoms, none before aducanumab had shown an impact on disease progression.<br />One reason a breakthrough has proven elusive is that researchers haven’t figured out exactly what causes Alzheimer’s. Its hallmark is an accretion of amyloid plaque and tau tangles in the brain, which usually begins long before people show symptoms. Some scientists believe that removing amyloid could slow disease progression.<br />Enter aducanumab, which is a monoclonal antibody cloned from older people who showed unusually slow cognitive decline. It works by clearing amyloid. A high dose of the drug in a late-stage trial removed 71% of the amyloid buildup after 18 months.<br />Yet more than two dozen experimental drugs targeting amyloid have failed to show benefits. Two years ago, aducanumab looked to be another failure after a midpoint “futility analysis” of two Phase 3 clinical trials with some 3,200 participants apparently showed no benefit.</td>

      <td>Joe Manchin has brought the wrath of the political left down upon him after writing in a hometown newspaper on the weekend that he doesn’t support a federal takeover of state voting law and won’t break the Senate filibuster. But the West Virginia Senator is playing political chess—and doing Democrats a favor too.<br />“This is so on brand for this country. Record number of black voters show up to save this democracy, only for white supremacy to be upheld by a cowardly, power-hungry white dude. @Sen_JoeManchin is a clown,” tweeted Jemele Hill, one of the left’s more nuanced  Twitter  enforcers.<br />A sagacious aide to Sen. Dick Durbin used Twitter to say “I don’t think our founding fathers anticipated the survival of this democratic experiment to rest in the hands of a man who lives in a house boat,” as Mr. Manchin apparently does. What’s wrong with house boats? She later deleted her tweet.<br />Especially obtuse are the progressives tweeting that Senate Democrats should strip Mr. Manchin of his committee assignments. By all means, please do. As the majority maker in a 50-50 Senate, Mr. Manchin could change parties and have his pick of committee seats as a member of the GOP majority. Readers who reached maturity before the Age of Woke recall that James Jeffords, a Vermont Republican, switched parties and made Democrats the majority in a 50-50 Senate in spring 2001.<br />Mr. Manchin has never been known as a fierce conviction politician. He’s not Rand Paul (R., Ky.) voting to kill the GOP’s ObamaCare reform in 2017 because it wasn’t libertarian pure. Mr. Manchin is a canny operator from a right-leaning state who is trying to navigate between his West Virginia constituents and the bullying demands of the left-wing Democrats who dominate the national party.</td>

      <td>It’s usually a good day at the Supreme Court when Justices left and right agree unanimously on the law, helping to restrain lower judges with overactive political imaginations. That happened Monday in Sanchez v. Mayorkas, as the High Court put a corner of immigration law back in proper order.<br />The case was brought by Jose Santos Sanchez, who came to the U.S. illegally in 1997. When earthquakes struck his native El Salvador in 2001, Mr. Sanchez received permission to stay in the U.S. and work under the shelter of Temporary Protected Status. After 20 years of “temporary” status, he and his wife have built a life.<br />TPS recipients can seek permanent residency, but the key statutory provision is limited to people who were lawfully “admitted.” So a foreigner arriving on a student or tourist visa, say, might get TPS after a disaster at home and then eventually receive a green card. Because of Mr. Sanchez’s initial illegal entry, he was denied permanent residency. But he argued that the grant of TPS itself constituted a legal “admission.”<br />Mr. Sanchez lost at the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, but the judiciary was split on the matter. In a 2013 case, the Sixth Circuit accepted an argument akin to Mr. Sanchez’s. That ruling featured a footnote chastising the U.S. Code “that using the term ‘alien’ to refer to other human beings is offensive and demeaning.”<br />A little of this spirit seems to live at the Supreme Court: In a case last month, Justice Sonia Sotomayor gave a quote from a 1987 opinion by the late Justice Thurgood Marshall, but she conspicuously edited the line to say “noncitizen” instead of “alien.”</td>

      <td>Terms like blasphemy, subversion and hate speech are impossible to deﬁne. No wonder attempts at censorship are inconsistent and often absurd.</td>
      <td>‘Free Speech Is Killing Us” was the title of a polemical op-ed published in the New York Times in 2019. Surveying various unconnected crimes and political developments, the article’s author, New Yorker staff writer Andrew Marantz, warned that “the brutality that germinates on the internet can leap into the world of flesh and blood.”<br />A commitment to open expression has always defined liberalism, which gradually expanded our First Amendment protections. But now we see many liberals abandoning that principle, perhaps because they are no longer liberals in any meaningful sense of the term. How could they be, if they want tech barons to police our online reading?  Facebook  recently decided to stop blocking posts that suggested a “lab-leak” origin of Covid, but at the same time the company has been boasting of its efforts to downrank or “shadow-ban” accounts that share “misinformation” (in other words, they make it difficult for readers to find those accounts, without telling the account owners).<br />We sorely need a reminder of the follies and crimes of censorship. In “Dangerous Ideas,” Eric Berkowitz, a journalist and lawyer, offers a global history that identifies some recurring patterns in the suppression of free thinking. For starters, crackdowns almost inevitably happen when societies confront overwhelming crises. Philosophy flourished in ancient Athens, where free males (at least) enjoyed intellectual liberty, but after the Athenians suffered military defeat and a devastating pandemic, they canceled Socrates. Then Plato’s “Republic,” putting words into Socrates’ mouth, laid out a program for absolute control of speech and thought, anticipating in detail modern totalitarianism. Reading Plato, Mr. Berkowitz recognizes Mao’s Cultural Revolution.<br />The author also dissects iconoclasm. We may try to purge history by destroying graven images—as the Roman Senate did to Emperor Domitian, for instance, or Reformation converts did to Catholic icons, or French revolutionaries did to aristocratic art (which the Louvre was created to preserve). In normal times public statues are restrooms for pigeons, but in moments of panic they must be toppled.<br />Often censorship involves a swing of the pendulum, where a burst of untrammeled liberty produces a repressive reaction. The English Puritans demanded freedom of worship, but once Oliver Cromwell was in charge, they shut down pamphleteers and the theater. The French Revolution first liberated journalists, then guillotined them. The ratification of the First Amendment to America’s Constitution was followed by the Sedition Act. Mr. Berkowitz notes that Weimar Germany produced “Anders als die Andern,” the first sympathetic film treatment of homosexuality. The Nazis destroyed every print they could find, and only fragments survive today. Often, the damage done by censorship is permanent.</td>

      <td>Defying your party’s wishes is courageous and can be costly.</td>
      <td>Sen. Joe Manchin is a courageous man. He has strong views and hails from a state that values independence. Recently he chose not to support the For the People Act. He also stood up for preserving the Senate filibuster. In both cases he opposed his party’s leaders.<br />Setting aside the pros or cons of his positions, the vitriol unleashed against him by his fellow Democrats is condemnable. Heaven forbid someone in American politics actually does what he thinks is right.<br />I know a thing or two about standing up to your own party. I won no friends when, as a Republican member of the House, I led opposition to President George H.W. Bush’s budget because of its sky-high deficits. My decision as governor to extend Medicaid healthcare benefits to more low-income Ohioans was lambasted by Republicans because of the move’s tie to ObamaCare. My opposition to Donald Trump sparked equal hostility.<br />What rankled me then, and frustrates me as I watch what’s happening to Mr. Manchin, is that critics always ask the wrong question. Instead of asking, “Why won’t those troublemakers just do as they’re told?” it’d be better to think of it this way: “If they’re willing to take this much heat, do they see something I don’t?”<br />Courage is valued not because it’s common or easy—just the opposite. It brings risks to prosperity, reputation and even life and limb. No one wants to be in that position. Everyone would rather be loved. Therefore, when someone is willing to risk stakes that high, shouldn’t it make us pause for a moment? Taking it a step further, when someone takes a path that potentially comes with high costs, and we only respond with criticism, are we missing something amazing unfolding right before us that we say we value—courage?</td>

      <td>Election results in Texas show the migration to the GOP may finally be starting.</td>
      <td>For decades some conservatives, yours truly among them, have argued that Latino Americans, with their ethic of faith and family and work, ought to be natural Republicans. On Saturday in a South Texas city on the Mexican border, Javier Villalobos gave America a glimpse of what this future might look like when he became the first Republican elected mayor of McAllen—the 85% Latino seat of Hidalgo County.<br />“Villalobos’ election should surprise absolutely no one who followed how counties in the Rio Grande Valley swung heavily toward Trump in the last election,” says Mike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and author of “The Plot to Change America: How Identity Politics Is Dividing the Land of the Free.”<br />As Mr. Gonzalez notes, the auguries were there for anyone who cared to look. In 2016 Hillary Clinton carried Hidalgo County by 41 points. But in 2020, Joe Biden won by only 17 points. Meanwhile Zapata County—what the Washington Post calls “the bluest of blue counties along the river”—flipped for Donald Trump in 2020, the first victory for a GOP presidential candidate there since Warren G. Harding a century ago.<br />These developments have Democrats sounding the alarm. A May postelection analysis by a trio of left-leaning organizations noted that while Latino turnout in 2020 grew “dramatically” over 2016, Democrats saw a “significant dip in support in places with high concentrations of Latino and Hispanic voters.” Nor were Republicans simply sitting on the sidelines all the while. When asked by Texas Monthly what was attractive to Latinos about the Republican Party, Chuck Rocha, an adviser to the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, answered this way:<br />“At the Republican National Convention, the party had one Latino speaker after another telling their immigration story and how they lived the American dream. And if you just sit back and watch that or read the coverage, you might think, ‘Hey, these Republicans are all right. They like immigrants. They want to build entrepreneurship. They want us to all be rich like Donald Trump.’ ”</td>
