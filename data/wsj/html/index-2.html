      <td>FRANKFURT—The European Central Bank kept its large monetary stimulus unchanged on Thursday, pledging to continue backstopping the region’s governments via large-scale debt purchases as a stubborn wave of Covid-19 infections darkened the economic outlook.<br />In a statement, the ECB said it would continue to buy up to 1.85 trillion euros, equivalent to $2.24 trillion, of eurozone bonds through March 2022, as planned, meaning that it will continue to absorb the bulk of the debt issued by eurozone countries this year.<br />The ECB’s bond purchases support the region’s governments as they spend freely on job-furlough and other programs aimed at keeping businesses and jobs alive. The ECB left its key interest rate unchanged at minus 0.5%.<br />Europe’s economic outlook has darkened since the ECB’s last policy meeting in December, when President Christine Lagarde unveiled a large new stimulus package. With infection rates still high across the region, governments in Germany and other countries have signaled in recent days that they will tighten or extend social restrictions. Meanwhile, the rollout of vaccinations has been sluggish.<br />Analysts worry that the region’s $13 trillion economy will slide back into recession in the first three months of 2021, as businesses and households remain cautious. Eurozone inflation has been below zero for the past five months, through December, far from the ECB’s target of just below 2%. The euro has also staged a rally against the dollar in recent months, hurting the competitiveness of Europe’s large exporters in crucial overseas markets such as the U.S.</td>

The national rollout of Covid-19 vaccine doses, they agreed, wasn’t going fast enough.<br />By the end of the stroll, they had sketched the outline of a plan to speed things up: Combine the logistics technology of  Honeywell International Inc.,  the expertise of health system Atrium Health, and the real estate of Tepper Sports & Entertainment to inoculate thousands more people a day than the average North Carolina vaccination site currently does.<br />“It’s the last mile,” Honeywell Chief Executive Darius Adamczyk said of the problems that have plagued the vaccine rollout. Mr. Adamczyk is part of the North Carolina trio, along with Atrium CEO Eugene Woods and Tepper President Tom Glick. “We dramatically need to pick up the pace.”<br />The North Carolina executives aren’t the only business leaders stepping in to offer private-sector expertise to help more Americans get Covid-19 shots.<br />Washington state this week said that private companies will lend expertise to accelerate its vaccine rollout, among them  Starbucks Corp. , which will provide help with vaccine-administration facility layout and has started working on ways to reduce patient wait times.</td>

      <td>The U.S. stock market’s most popular financial services exchange-traded fund is hovering near an all-time high for the first time since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, propelled by a handful of big stocks.<br />The  which has roughly $30 billion in assets and tracks the S&P 500’s financial sector, reached $31.46 a share last week, eclipsing its February 2020 high. Shares traded just below $31 on Wednesday.<br />ETFs tracking the S&P 500’s technology, communication, consumer-discretionary and health-care sectors surpassed their pre-Covid-19 highs last year. But many cyclical groups, including financials, had lagged behind the broader stock market’s recovery as investors favored buying shares of fast-growing companies. Since the November elections, though, the investment tides have shifted toward economically sensitive companies amid expectations of heavy spending by Democrats, which investors expect will help boost growth.<br />Investors have sought to increase their exposure to bank stocks by putting money into the Financial Select Sector ETF for 11 straight weeks. Flows so far in January have reached $3.6 billion, already exceeding every full-month total since November 2016, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper.<br />But some investors might not realize that the ETF is essentially a wager on the success of a few of the biggest financial stocks in the S&P 500.  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. and  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  account for about a quarter of the fund, while the addition of  Bank of America Corp.  increases the collective weighting of the three stocks to roughly 33%. It is no surprise then that the ETF’s return to record levels coincided with a rally in those stocks.</td>

But analysts surveyed by FactSet foresee lower sales this year, in part reflecting a pair of divestitures and growing competitive pressure. And while Intel has benefited from a boom in demand for PCs in the work-from-home economy, much of the added buying has focused on lower-cost laptops that aren’t as profitable. Net income for 2020 is expected to fall to $19.3 billion, from $21.1 billion the year prior.<br />Intel’s longer-term strategy around the outsourcing of chip production is also in flux ahead of the arrival of Pat Gelsinger as CEO. Bob Swan, the company’s departing chief executive, said last year that a decision was forthcoming by early this year on whether to have the company’s advanced chips made by a third party after Intel fell behind Asian rivals in the development of the next generation of superfast semiconductors.<br />The company is considering outsourcing production of some of its most prized chips to those Asian rivals, and particularly to  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , the largest and most advanced contract chip maker in the world, according to people familiar with the matter.</td>

The effect was more pronounced among residents, the company said, an 80% reduction in risk of Covid-19.<br />The findings signal the potential for a new preventive weapon that could augment the fledgling Covid-19 vaccination effort to stem the pandemic.<br />Lilly said it would ask U.S. health regulators to widen the drug’s authorized use to include protecting people in long-term-care facilities where someone has recently been diagnosed with Covid-19.<br />The partial results were from a last-stage, or Phase 3, study conducted in partnership with the National Institutes of Health. Lilly disclosed the data in a news release and said it plans to publish full results in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</td>

      <td>Mask-wearing and higher vaccination rates have contributed to historically low levels of seasonal influenza</td>
      <td>Influenza, usually raging throughout the Northern Hemisphere this time of year, has become virtually invisible.<br />It is a small bright spot amid Covid-19, although the number of people saved from a flu death pales next to the number dying from the new pandemic. It also presents questions that doctors around the globe will likely be wrestling with for years: If flu can be nearly wiped out this season, why not every season? Which steps help the most to stop the flu from spreading?<br />“This is an extremely puzzling phenomenon. We’re in a historic, unbelievable situation,” said Norio Sugaya, a pediatrician who serves on a World Health Organization influenza committee.<br />The WHO says the measures people and governments are taking to prevent the spread of Covid-19, such as wearing masks and limiting public gatherings, have probably helped keep the flu in check. Increased flu vaccination rates may also be contributing, it says.<br />Another hypothesis holds that the broad spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, in countries like the U.S. may play a role in blocking the flu by lifting people’s immunity against other viruses. One study in the spring of 2020 in New York City found that people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were far less likely to be carrying other common viruses such as influenza viruses. Still, research into that hypothesis is just beginning.</td>

The blasts highlight the security challenges facing Iraq after the U.S. withdrew much of its military presence from the country in the last days of the Trump administration.<br />No group claimed responsibility for the bombing. But it bore the hallmarks of Islamic State, which in the past has carried out lethal bombings targeting civilians throughout Iraq and the wider Middle East.<br />Iraqi President Barham Salih condemned the attack, saying in a tweet, “The two terrorist explosions targeting innocent people in Baghdad and at this specific time confirms the attempt by the groups of darkness to target all national entitlements and our people’s aspirations for a safe future.”<br />Yehia Rasool, a military spokesman for Iraq’s prime minister, said Iraqi security forces had received information about the two bombers before the attack and were pursuing them when they blew themselves up. An official statement from Mr. Rasool didn’t include further details about the pursuit of the attackers.</td>

In a tweet, the departing chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Idaho Republican Jim Risch, applauded the incoming White House for the invitation.<br />Beijing sees Taiwan as part of Chinese territory and regards U.S. interactions with the democratic, self-ruled island as one of the most sensitive issues in bilateral relations with Washington.

      <td>Women have fallen fast for Bumble’s platform, but investors may want to take it slow</td>
      <td>Is Bumble Inc.’s bet on women worth the buzz? That might depend on whether its mission also flies with men.<br />The owner of the No. 2 dating app has filed to go public with valuation talk in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion. Founder Whitney Wolfe Herd started it in 2014 to turn the traditional dating dynamic on its head. Instead of men initiating contact with women, who often say that attention is often aggressive or unwanted, Bumble was created as a platform on which women must make the first move. That was two years after Ms. Wolfe Herd co-founded dating app Tinder, which is now known mostly for its singles looking for hookups. She has said she saw the problems with archaic dating rules and sought to change them.<br />For women looking for love, this has been a popular tack: Bumble says it believes its namesake app has one of the highest percentages of women paying users among dating apps. The question is whether it will prove to be a lucrative one for investors.<br />A higher percentage of the Bumble app’s users convert to payers than the market average among dating apps, according to OC&C Strategy Consultants—nearly 9% paid conversion among its 12.3 million monthly active users, the company said.<br />But a women-centric approach also could pose some limitations to growth. Men are currently the significant majority of online dating users, according to the company. And while some men may enjoy sitting back and waiting to be approached, the preference doesn’t appear to be unanimous: Bumble says it has about 30% more female users for every male user compared with the gender mix of users in the North America freemium dating market who don’t use Bumble, citing OC&C.</td>

Most hedge funds hold preferred shares that carry a dividend. These shares are junior to the government’s stake and thus don’t get paid dividends until after the government is paid. So their value is greatly diminished by the large stake the government retains.<br />In one scenario where hedge funds would profit, Fannie and Freddie would raise fresh capital, junior preferred shares would be converted to common stock, and the government would write down or eliminate its senior preferred shares.<br />Investors including John Paulson, Anchorage Capital Group, Discovery Capital Management LLC, Blackstone Credit, Perry Capital, Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management LP and PointState Capital LP have been involved in the trade. Many funds are now expected to have lost money on the investment, though some early buyers and active traders profited.<br />It was a risky bet. But other complex, long-shot trades, including the subprime bet that the housing market would collapse, resulted in big paydays for some funds.</td>

      <td>Wall Street is launching a third exchange-traded fund that invests in special-purpose acquisition companies, accelerating a rush to cash in on investors’ enthusiasm for so-called blank-check firms.<br />The hedge fund Morgan Creek Capital Management and the financial-technology company Exos Financial plan to launch the SPAC ETF on Tuesday, the companies said. The new Morgan Creek-Exos SPAC Originated ETF will trade under the ticker SPXZ and consist of a mix of firms that recently went public by merging with a SPAC plus shell companies that are still seeking startups to take public.<br />Morgan Creek Chief Executive Officer Mark Yusko is the former endowment head at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and Exos is run by former  Credit Suisse Group AG  CEO Brady Dougan.  Credit Suisse  is one of the biggest SPAC underwriters on Wall Street.<br />Morgan Creek and Exos are the latest companies trying to make money from SPACs, which go public and then have up to two years to merge with a company. Upon completion of a deal, that company gets the SPAC’s place on a stock exchange, allowing it to access everyday investors. The new ETF will be the third focused on the sector created in the past few months, joining the  and the SPAC and New Issue ETF, run by Tuttle Tactical Management.<br />While SPACs are still a small part of markets, they have soared in popularity lately, attracting investors hopeful about popular themes such as electric vehicles and green energy. The creation of a third ETF underscores a sudden ubiquity, with people from the singer Ciara to the basketball great Shaquille O’Neal backing them.</td>

      <td>Prices have soared since last May, as pandemic effects hurt production while demand stays strong</td>
      <td>The price of palm oil, used in products from chocolate to toothpaste, is near a decade high and likely to climb further.<br />In Malaysia and Indonesia, sources of roughly 84% of the world’s palm oil, labor shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic have reduced production, while major consumers China and India are buying more for cooking and manufacturing. Malaysian stockpiles are at their lowest levels in years.<br />The benchmark futures price touched the equivalent of $961 a metric ton earlier this month, the highest since August 2011 and up more than 100% since May. The contract trades on the  Bursa Malaysia  exchange and is denominated in Malaysian ringgit.<br />On Jan. 11, Malaysia imposed its latest lockdown, set to last two weeks and covering parts of the country where coronavirus cases are soaring and hospitals are reaching capacity. Such measures over the past year have hampered harvest, which relies heavily on migrant labor. Many migrant workers in Malaysia come from neighboring, more populous Indonesia, but pandemic-tightened borders limit the movement of people.<br />Palm oil, extracted from the orange-fleshed fruit of oil palms, has gained popularity as an ingredient in food products such as cookies, nondairy spreads and instant noodles because it is inexpensive, versatile and doesn’t contain artery-clogging trans fats. It also has a higher melting point than dairy fat, so it is often used in milk chocolate to prevent melting in hot climates. Cosmetics companies use it in lipstick, makeup and skin-care products. The oil is also a key feedstock for biodiesel.</td>

      <td>A tougher regulatory approach—and probably slower growth—now look inevitable</td>
      <td>Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, once the richest man in the country, has resurfaced after being out of the public eye for months. But his real troubles—and those of his business empire—may be just beginning.<br />Mr. Ma made his first public appearance in nearly three months on Wednesday, speaking to a group of rural teachers in an online philanthropic event. Speculation about his whereabouts has been rife since his last public appearance in October, when he gave a speech that angered regulators. Since then, the record initial public offerings of fintech firm Ant Group, which Mr. Ma controls, were both pulled at the last minute. China’s antitrust regulator launched a probe into the business practices of e-commerce giant  Alibaba ,  another company in Mr. Ma’s empire, last month.<br />Investors took Mr. Ma’s reappearance as an auspicious sign—Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed shares jumped 8.5% Wednesday. They may have inferred that Mr. Ma is now back in Beijing’s good graces and the regulatory storm will be over. But there doesn’t seem to be a letup: on the same day Mr. Ma made his public appearance, China’s central bank released draft rules governing nonbank payment systems, in which Ant’s Alipay is a major player.<br />There are still uncertainties about what some of the draft rules mean. The rules, for example, say if two players have more than two-thirds of the nonbank payment markets—Alipay and Tencent’s  WeChat  Pay dominate China’s mobile and internet payments—then the central bank would hold talks with the companies. It’s unclear what the exact consequences or remedies would be after such warnings, though. The rules also seem to use a broader definition of market—possibly including some traditional payment channels—to determine whether a payment company is market-dominating.<br />But the overall direction seems clear: the government wants stricter regulation of fast-growing online financial services, which could add systemic risks to the country’s state-dominated financial system. Beijing likely views China’s ubiquitous mobile payment systems as a positive contribution to society, but it is more skeptical when companies like Ant leverage their user base and consumer data to jump into online lending.</td>

      <td>China’s big telecom carriers asked the New York Stock Exchange to rethink their planned delisting, the latest twist in a to-and-fro about whether they should be allowed to trade in U.S. markets.<br />In separate filings Thursday morning in Hong Kong,  China Mobile Ltd. ,  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd.  and  China Telecom Corp.  said they had filed requests asking the NYSE to reverse its decision to delist their American depositary receipts. They said they had asked if a trading halt on their ADRs could be lifted in the meantime.<br />The requests came hours after Joe Biden was sworn in as the new U.S. president. Mr. Biden signed 15 executive orders and two executive actions on his first day in office, reversing some of former President Trump’s key policies.<br />In November, Mr. Trump signed an order barring Americans from investing in a list of Chinese companies that the U.S. said supplied and otherwise supported China’s military, intelligence and security services. The order bans U.S. investors from buying blacklisted securities from Jan. 11, and gives them until Nov. 11 to shed their holdings.<br />While these three telecoms’ parent companies, which aren’t publicly traded, are covered by the ban, it was initially unclear if the listed groups were also included. This month, the NYSE first said it would delist the trio, then changed its mind, then decided it would delist them after all.</td>

The company, whose stock also trades in Shenzhen, makes electric cars, batteries, plug-in hybrids and fossil-fuel-powered vehicles.<br />Investor enthusiasm about green cars and breakthroughs in battery technology have sent the company’s stock soaring, making it more attractive for BYD to raise new funds. BYD stock in Hong Kong has more than quintupled in a year, giving it a market capitalization of $91 billion. That is roughly in line with  NIO Inc.,  a newer Chinese rival, and compares to an $806 billion market cap for  Tesla Inc.,  according to FactSet.<br />Other electric-car makers have also tapped equity markets for funds as they race to secure a bigger slice of the growing sector. Chinese competitor  Xpeng Inc.  in December raised $2.5 billion from a follow-on offering of American depositary receipts, while NIO has raised more than $4.5 billion in December and January by selling ADRs and convertible bonds.<br />A unit of  Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  has held a stake in BYD since 2008. As of June 2020, Berkshire held 8.25% of BYD, or nearly 25% of its Hong Kong-listed stock, according to BYD’s half-year report.</td>

The recorder, which is one of the plane’s two black boxes, was retrieved a few days after the crash.<br />The data indicates the so-called autothrottle system—which automatically adjusts fuel flow and thrust to maintain the path set by pilots—wasn’t operating properly on one engine at some point during the Boeing 737-500’s climb away from the nation’s capital, Jakarta, on Jan. 9, according to some of the people familiar with the matter.<br />Instead of shutting off the system, they said, the flight-data recorder indicates pilots tried to get the stuck throttle to function. Such engine-control malfunctions can create significant differences in power between engines, making a twin-engine jet harder to control and it could potentially distract pilots from maintaining a safe flight.<br />Twin-engine aircraft such as the 737 are designed to fly safely on a single engine and pilots are trained to do that in various situations. But large differences in thrust between engines, according to pilots and safety experts, require swift pilot recognition of the problem, which would ideally be followed by quick responses and manual commands.</td>

In that role, he helped craft the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping overhaul of financial regulation that followed the 2008-09 financial crisis.<br />The White House declined to comment, and the Treasury Department didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mr. Barr, who is currently dean of public policy at the University of Michigan, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.<br />It was unclear when the White House would announce the nomination. Mr. Barr would succeed Brian Brooks, who stepped down last week after about eight months as the Trump administration’s acting comptroller.<br />Mr. Barr would join Mr. Biden’s prospective regulatory team alongside Rohit Chopra, the president’s likely pick to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Gary Gensler, the nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Starboard is aiming to oust Corteva Chief Executive Jim Collins over what the activist says is mediocre performance.

Mr. Smith said in a presentation at the time that the company’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were little-changed from when it was formed in 2019, lagging behind peers.<br />In response to a question about that criticism on Corteva’s earnings call in November, Mr. Collins said he agrees the business has room to improve its margins. “Probably the only question in that whole discussion is our view of the timing of that improvement,” he said.</td>

Robert Menendez for allegedly bribing the New Jersey Democrat. That case was dropped in 2018 after a mistrial.<br />A lawyer for Dr. Melgen, Sam Stern, didn’t respond to a request for comment Wednesday.<br />Spokespeople for Mr. Trump didn’t respond to requests for comment.</td>

      <td>On the last-minute clemency list, Steve Bannon stands out.</td>
      <td>On his way out the door Wednesday, President Trump granted a long list of pardons and commutations, and it’s a mix of the reasonable, the unseemly and the egregious. Here’s looking at you, Steve Bannon.<br />Of 143 people granted clemency, many are drug offenders. To pick a commutation, Isaac Nelson served more than half of his mandatory 20 years for crimes involving at least five kilograms of cocaine and 50 grams of crack, the White House said. Under the First Step Act, signed in 2018, “he would likely face a 10-year sentence.”<br />Some of the drug crimes are no small matter, since they appear to involve trafficking literally tons of marijuana, plus laundering millions of dollars, which is a business that can turn violent fast. Yet public attitudes toward marijuana have shifted. Determining that a sentence was excessive is a judgment call, which is why a President has broad clemency discretion.<br />Less admirable is the pardon for Duke Cunningham, the former Congressman who’s no longer in prison, but who betrayed his constituents by taking bribes. Ditto on the commutation for Salomon Melgen, a big Democratic donor caught up in the probe of Sen. Robert Menendez. Dr. Melgen was given a 17-year sentence for defrauding Medicare of $42 million.<br />Mr. Trump, thankfully, didn’t pardonEdward Snowden. But why pardon Mr. Bannon? He was charged with fleecing Trump supporters in a scheme to build a private wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. The fund raised $25 million, the indictment says, and donors were told every penny would go to the project.</td>

      <td>Whatever their partisan affiliation, all Americans can take pride in Wednesday’s inaugural proceedings for President Joe Biden. The peaceful transfer of power from one party to another is a sign of underlying democratic strength no matter our current political distemper.<br />The ceremony at the Capitol had an unabashed patriotic feel that is all too rare these days. Traditional anthems and prayerful invocations were the order of the hour. Former Presidents were on hand from both major parties as usual, even if Donald Trump wasn’t. No one took a knee when Lady Gaga sang the national anthem.<br />And it was especially moving, at least to us, to see new Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband walk down the Capitol steps escorting Mike Pence and his wife to their waiting car. Mr. Pence in particular deserved this traditional show of respect after his role on Jan. 6 when he refused to reject the state electoral votes as President Trump demanded. He should be getting more praise than he is for that display of constitutional principle.<br />These rituals send a message to a diverse country, and to the world, about America’s fundamental institutional strength despite a bitter election campaign and the turmoil of recent weeks. In China the transfers of power are from one Communist Party cadre to another, and public political rites are limited to unanimous acclamation. Enemies have often misjudged America’s raucous politics for national weakness—to their eventual regret.<br />Mr. Biden struck many good notes in an Inaugural Address that will be remembered more for its moment following the Capitol riot than for its words. The speech had a personal flavor with touches of his Catholicism, such as quoting St. Augustine and praying for the dead. In this and in other personal manners, the new President is refreshingly unwoke.</td>

      <td>The Biden administration’s Middle East policy will reportedly focus on rejoining the Iran nuclear deal and renewing Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. This could undermine key allies in Israel and Saudi Arabia while ignoring a core geopolitical challenge that few in Washington are addressing: growing Chinese influence in the Middle East.<br />Through its trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, China has invested in a port near the Persian Gulf in Gwadar, Pakistan, and a military base by the entrance to the Red Sea at Djibouti. The Chinese also envision a military base at Port Sudan, further north on the Red Sea, and a naval facility at Jiwani, Pakistan, on the Iranian border. Then there are the new Israeli port facilities at Haifa and Ashdod, which the Chinese will likely be administering. Afghanistan could one day become a branch line for the Belt and Road corridor from western China through Pakistan to the Arabian Sea. China is the largest trading partner for both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. China is investing billions of dollars in Egypt and more billions as part of a strategic pact with Iran.<br />Unlike many in Washington, who separate regions in order of perceived importance, Chinese strategists think organically about geography. They recognize that in a smaller, more interconnected and confining world, regions and continents work together and flow into each other. Thus, the Chinese know that the road, railway and port system they are building across the Middle East will one day give them a strong hand in Europe and East Asia—not to mention East Africa.<br />Beijing doesn’t take sides. China is happy to work with Iran, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Rather than promote a liberal vision—or any vision—the Chinese are remorselessly mercantile and imperial in their approach. It’s all about money and transportation links: classical geography fitted to a postmodern world.<br />For centuries British foreign policy was aimed at preventing any one power from dominating continental Europe. Similarly, American foreign policy should now aim at preventing any one power from dominating Afro-Eurasia—what the great British geographer Halford Mackinder labeled the “World-Island.” By linking Europe with East Asia through the Middle East, China would eventually develop the ability to threaten North America economically and militarily. This is ultimately what Belt and Road is all about. The Biden administration must focus on stopping it.</td>

      <td>Americans don’t like the idea of a national identity card. But in an era of intense controversies over election integrity and illegal immigration, it is time to rethink the subject.<br />Our views on national identity documents trace back to the British. When the U.S. was founded, immigration was largely unregulated, and people knew their neighbors, so voting was secure.<br />We are now in a crisis in which many people lack confidence in the integrity of elections. Some of these fears are unfounded, but in 2020 unsolicited mailing of ballots and abandoning of signature checks on mail ballots provided the basis for skepticism far beyond the concerns of prior years. Restoring trust in elections is crucial to the country’s unity.<br />Republicans have long pushed for in-person voting using government-issued photo ID. Democrats have opposed such a system on grounds that the poor are less likely to have such identification. But if everyone had a national identity card and presented it when voting, we could have full enfranchisement with full integrity.<br />Immigration could also benefit from a national ID card. In 1986 Congress enacted a grand compromise in which amnesty for illegal aliens was paired with discouraging further illegal immigration by mandating checks of immigration status for people being hired. Such checks failed because no identity system was in place; the result was amnesty with a surge of new illegal immigration.</td>

      <td>President Joe Biden’s inauguration marks not only a new administration’s beginning but also a new chapter for the loyal opposition.<br />The Grand Old Party lost the White House while picking up U.S. House seats, holding half the Senate, and adding to its numbers in state legislative chambers. These conflicting outcomes leave Republicans facing the difficult task of cementing blue-collar Trump voters into their ranks while regaining strength in the suburbs and making inroads with an increasingly diverse electorate.<br />To rebuild, Republicans must decide what their party stands for. The way forward begins with clarifying what the GOP’s answers should be to the nation’s challenges, with an eye to the 2022 elections.<br />This won’t be easy. Tensions between the party’s various elements are difficult to navigate, but it’s important to remember that President Donald Trump’s most popular achievements were conservative: originalist judges, a pro-growth tax cut, regulatory relief, strong national defense, recognition of the global threat posed by China, secure borders, and respect for life and religious liberty.<br />GOP officeholders, candidates and party leaders should offer ideas that apply timeless conservative principles to America’s changing circumstances. As Republicans oppose the Biden administration’s agenda, they should contrast their new initiatives with the Democrats’ approach. The key is to remember that what they’re for is as important as what they’re against. The values underlying Republican initiatives are crucial, too. There are more conservatives in America who believe in traditional values, family, faith, personal responsibility, patriotism and law and order than there are liberals who don’t.</td>

      <td>Nasdaq wants to mandate wider representation on its companies’ boards but has little proof of the benefits.</td>
      <td>Corporate directors are called on to do a few important things: Hire a CEO and oversee management, provide strategic direction, protect and promote the interests of investors, and ensure the company’s books are honest. Now, many claim, directors should also represent the country’s demographics.<br />That is the upshot of a requirement by one of America’s largest financial markets. Nasdaq is calling for all its listed companies to appoint within the next four years no fewer than two “diverse” directors: at least one woman, and one person from an underrepresented racial or ethnic group or someone who identifies as LGBTQ. Any company failing this requirement would be obligated to explain why. This new standard now faces approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br />It would be tempting for the SEC, soon to be led by a Biden appointee, to approve the proposal. Many of the calls for diversity requirements on board membership and recruitment are being made by large asset managers and institutional investors. The SEC could conceivably approve it in the name of investor-led democracy.<br />But that would be shortsighted. For one thing, diversity requirements are political at their core and, in my experience, any securities regulation that feeds the base instincts of political partisanship will inevitably be undone by the opposing party when it has the chance, or face challenges in the courts. Regulation that is enduring and sustainable—on any issue—requires the SEC’s expert analysis, professional moderation and careful review.<br />The issue of diversity on boards is also emotional, and it often creates more heat than light. Both sides have plenty of anecdotes to draw from. I have stacks of annual reports from boards with members who are all white, all male, all over 50—and quite mediocre. At the same time, I have seen women or minorities whose membership on corporate boards was forgettable at best. There is no guarantee of competence in a director based on sex or skin color.</td>

Mike Sommers, president and chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, used his annual address last week to strike a conciliatory tone at times, saying it wanted to work with Mr. Biden on emissions limits and trade policy.<br />But he also said the group would aggressively defend the industry on core interests, especially access to federal lands and offshore oil.<br />“The bottom line for us is that we are going to work with the Biden administration when we can, but we will oppose them when we must,” Mr. Sommers said. “We will do everything we can to fight for the oil-and-gas industry across the United States.”</td>

      <td>While we celebrate that the death rate from cancer in the U.S. dropped 2.4% from 2017 to 2018 and that the cancer mortality rate has fallen 31% since its peak in 1991 (“Cancer Death Rate in 2018 Fell By the Largest-Ever Yearly Amount,” U.S. News, Jan. 13), Covid-19 is having a negative effect on cancer prevention and early detection.<br />The Prevent Cancer Foundation’s research shows a significant portion of adults are missing or postponing scheduled cancer screenings, and African-Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately affected. And let’s not forget that 20% of parents are missing their children’s scheduled vaccinations to protect against serious diseases—including the HPV vaccine, which can prevent at least six types of cancer.<br />We know that in the coming months and years, preventable deaths from cancer will increase. Now isn’t the time to be complacent. With screening, cancer can be prevented or detected early to dramatically improve patient outcomes. Americans need to keep routine cancer screenings appointments or reschedule the ones they have missed.<br />We are encouraging people to get their cancer screenings back on the books and talk to their health-care providers about the safety precautions that are in place so they can feel comfortable keeping those appointments. Breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, oral, prostate and skin cancer screenings are important to prevent cancer or detect it early. These screenings save lives.<br />Thank you for elevating awareness on the importance of screenings and options available to patients. We are making tremendous advances in the fight against cancer.

Lewis’s “Upping the Waiting Game—Moynihan Train Hall, the expansion of Penn Station, imbues rail travel with some grandeur” (Arts in Review, Jan. 14) affirms the importance of proactivity and innovation when skeptics are writing cities off.<br />Moynihan’s success should be a starting point for broadening our thinking to include the entire region. At ReThinkNYC, we believe there is a once-in-a-century opportunity to unlock this region’s upside potential, including New York City proper, by unifying the transit network centered on a rethought and rebuilt above-ground Penn Station, like the original, across from the Moynihan. This will address Mr. Lewis’s concern that the Moynihan will be an “orphan” until the train lines are “organically integrated” and their century-old “piecemeal accretion” is put behind us. New or expanded transit hubs in Sunnyside, Queens, Secaucus and the Bronx would expand the region’s core to reduce car traffic, allow for fluid intraregional access to housing and the job market and add economic relevance to such places as Newark, Paterson and Jamaica, Queens. We would recreate a modernized, yet faithful, version of the original high-ceilinged naturally lighted McKim, Mead and White Penn Station, attracting ridership and maximizing positive economic activity. London’s acclaimed conversion of the St. Pancras station is an apt precedent.<br />Our proposals affirm the approach to streetscape and scale that Jane Jacobs, who actively protested the original Penn Station’s destruction, found so important in cities. Our hope is to help the region move beyond the auto-centric approach to land-use and funding decisions that, as Robert Caro pointed out in “The Power Broker,” impeded the quality of life in the tristate region for decades and, sadly, continues to do so today.<br />Samuel Turvey<br />Chairperson, ReThinkNYC</td>

After the European Union’s drugs agency ruled on Jan. 8 that six doses could be obtained from a vial, the companies cut the number of vials delivered, arguing that their contract was for a certain amount of doses, not vials. The companies have said they were on schedule to deliver the number of doses they had promised.<br />A Hamburg government spokeswoman said the state has struggled to extract the sixth dose as special syringes are required and authorities haven’t been able to purchase them in sufficient quantities.

Amid the throngs, it can be impossible to achieve any kind of contemplative state to allow real absorption of their many artistic treasures. While we are limited to armchair travel because of Covid-19, the impressive virtual visits offered by the Vatican Museums create the pleasurable sensation of seeing these typically crowded halls all alone. Digital tourism also allows you to see a few of the many rooms normally closed to the public, such as the Niccoline Chapel with frescoes by Fra Angelico (1395-1455).<br />All told, there are 26 distinct areas within the Vatican, ranging from the Pinacoteca or painting gallery; to unexpected troves such as the Jewish Lapidarium, containing inscriptions from the Jewish catacomb of Monteverde; and the ethnological collection, spanning works from Africa to China and Latin America, primarily the product of missionary work. The Vatican Museums website offers unusual accessibility to all of them—with a short introductory video, text and photographs and, in many cases, virtual tours.<br />Among the most stunning opportunities these tours create is to see each of Raphael’s four Stanze, a suite of rooms created for popes Julius II (1503-13) and Leo X (1513-21), as one rarely can in person. On walls and ceilings, Raphael depicted historical and philosophical allegories, complex subjects glorifying the history of the papacy as well as forging connections between the Christian and classical, pre-Christian civilizations.<br />In the the Stanza della Segnatura (1508-11), the magnificent fictive architecture of Raphael’s “The School of Athens”—with its expansive vault referring both to ancient ruins such as the Basilica of Maxentius and to ambitious new constructions then under way, such as St. Peter’s—is engrossing in itself. So are the varied attitudes and poses of that fresco’s ancient philosophers and mathematicians—the work includes portraits of Bramante as Euclid and Michelangelo as the famously ill-tempered philosopher Heraclitus.<br />But if one looks immediately across from it, as the 360-degree photography allows you to do, you may notice that Raphael has created an implied visual continuity of the pavement from “The School of Athens” into the fresco opposite, known as the “Disputa.” Above the ground plane, where popes and church fathers congregate, Raphael creates a platform of clouds, surmounted by Old Testament prophets interspersed with martyrs, saints and apostles. While “The School of Athens” represents the entirety of classical knowledge, the “Disputa” represents theological knowledge in two realms, on earth and in the heavens. The conversation Raphael creates across the room bridges the two worlds of the sacred and the secular, part of the larger effort advanced by Julius’s papacy.</td>

      <td>President Biden took office on Wednesday with none of his cabinet agencies led by Senate-confirmed secretaries.<br />Anticipating delays in the Senate due to the unsettled control of the chamber heading into January and former President Donald Trump’s looming impeachment trial, the Biden transition team has named acting agency chiefs to lead the major government agencies until the Senate can act.<br />Federal law specifies that acting officials in cabinet-level positions must either be next in line for a position or hold a Senate-confirmed position. Another category of individuals who are eligible to serve as acting officials are those who have served as an “officer or employee” of the same agency for at least 90 days during the preceding year, at a senior-level pay scale.<br />Acting secretaries have the same powers as Senate-confirmed secretaries but are limited by law to serving 210 days. At the start of an administration, acting secretaries are allowed to serve an additional 90 days. And if there is a pending nomination, federal law permits an even longer term of service.<br />Nevertheless, organizations promoting good governance say it is critical to effective government to have Senate-confirmed nominees in place as soon as possible.</td>

For today’s inauguration, President Joe Biden, first lady Dr. Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff have all chosen to wear the work of American designers or labels, including Ralph Lauren, Christopher John Rogers and Markarian. “These moments on Day One are so important for an industry that’s been so hard hit and impacted by the pandemic,” said Steven Kolb, chief executive officer of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. “By wearing these American designers, they’re not only boosting the business of those individuals, but they’re really boosting the $373 billion industry...We have a new administration that clearly is welcoming and wants to be supportive of our industry.”<br />Consciously or not, the color purple—which can be seen as symbolically marrying red and blue—is also a theme, with Ms. Harris, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama all favoring the color for today’s ceremony.<br />For today’s inauguration, the incoming first lady Dr. Biden wore a custom blue wool-tweed dress, coat and matching face mask by New York brand Markarian, which is designed by Alexandra O’Neill. Ms. Harris wore a regal purple coat and dress by Christopher John Rogers, a Black New York designer known for his striking use of color. Mr. Rogers was recently in the spotlight for crafting the structured blue suit worn by Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez in Vanity Fair’s December 2020 cover story on the congresswoman. Ms. Obama, whose fashion choices as first lady were breathlessly covered by the media and in the case of J.Crew, boosted sales of certain items, also chose a Black American designer for today’s inauguration. The former first lady wore a burgundy ensemble by Sergio Hudson.<br />At a pre-inauguration coronavirus memorial event last night, Dr. Biden and Ms. Harris also made strong statements in their choice of designer. Dr. Biden wore a purple dress, coat and a mask from emerging New York designer Jonathan Cohen, whose parents are Mexican. Ms. Harris wore a custom camel coat by Pyer Moss, a label founded by Kerby Jean-Raymond, a socially conscious Black designer of Haitian descent.<br />Ms. Harris’s stepdaughter Ella Emhoff, an art student with an interest in fashion, has gotten buzz on social media for her experimental looks. Yesterday she wore a cutting-edge skirt suit and tie by the American designer Thom Browne. For the inauguration, she wore a plaid embellished coat by Italian label Miu Miu.</td>

Ms. Harris also used Ms. Shelton’s Bible when she was sworn in as California’s attorney general and U.S. senator. Ms. Shelton helped take care of Ms. Harris and her sister while their mother worked when they were growing up.<br />Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice, was selected by Ms. Harris to officiate her swearing-in ceremony. She was escorted inside the Capitol by U.S. Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, a Black officer who redirected a mostly white mob away from lawmakers as they were being evacuated during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.<br />For some in attendance, watching Ms. Harris’s historic achievement was personal.</td>

      <td>Pent-up children can reconfigure chic modular furniture—like the pandemic best-seller the Nugget—into forts and palaces, saving parents sanity</td>
      <td>WHEN RACHEL GEER’S kids started slam-dunking a basketball into a nearby plastic hoop with the sofa as their launchpad, she suppressed the urge to scold. After all, they’d been stuck inside for 10 months. Luckily for the Chapel Hill, N.C., business analyst, the abused couch was a Nugget, the sort of modular sofa designed for such debauchery that interiors pros are recommending to families with children.<br />Beyond their resilience, such pieces are masters of metamorphosis. Amanda Lantz, a designer in Carmel, Ind., appreciates Jaxx’s boxy Modular Kid’s Love seat and Ottoman ($159, brookstone.com) for its ability to transform into a table or sleeper for nap time. Also safely soft-edged, the Kinbor Children’s Sofa can be reconfigured into a table and four chairs. With any modular set-up, Ms. Lantz recommends sticking to durable performance fabric such as Crypton or Inside-Out: “The last thing you want is something kids can crawl all over where every stain is going to show.”<br />Kids can flip, flop and prod the Nugget, from a sofa to bed to fort without help from mom or dad. Also fueling its feverish popularity: washable slipcovers and dense foam cushions. In 2020, sales of the modular settee—launched in 2014 by Nugget Comfort, based in Butner, N. C.—shot up roughly 250% over the previous year, according to co-founder Ryan Cocca. There’s currently a 3-month waiting list. Available in 15 solid colors, the sofa can also jibe aesthetically with adult décor. “I was able to incorporate the Nugget into the den of my home without it looking like a kids’ toy,” Ms. Geer said.<br />Some modular sofas deliver higher style at higher prices.  Roche Bobois ’s  tufted and piped Mah Jong blocks come in a virtually endless choice of pattern, including Missoni’s signature zigzag (from $2,120 per cushion, roche-bobois.com). Designer Jamie Drake in New York relies on Pierre Paulin’s Dune Sofa, which can be reconfigured into hillocks and meadows for imaginative play and extra sleepover spaces (from $4,700 per piece, ralphpucci.com). “With the right modular furniture, kids can be left to their creative devices,” said Mr. Drake, “and when they’re not commandeering it the adults can sink in and relax.”<br />In intergenerational spaces, Ms. Lantz mixes mutable sofas with pop art and a shaggy rug to “make the room not feel so serious.” Another destodgifier: oversize floor pillows. As a bonus, “they work as extra fort-building material.”</td>

But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.”<br />The 22-year-old from Los Angeles is the first National Youth Poet Laureate and the youngest poet to read at a presidential inauguration. Her mother watched from the socially distant, masked audience.<br />President Biden’s inaugural committee told Ms. Gorman on Dec. 30 that she had been selected for the role.<br />She said she approached the task very deliberately, first reviewing speeches given by abolitionist Frederick Douglass and President Lincoln and others who have spoken at divisive times.</td>

Even up against a pandemic and increased competition from some of the world’s biggest media companies, Netflix managed to grow its rolls to more than 200 million subscribers. This week’s streaming selections speak to the breadth of the service’s programming ambitions: from the critically acclaimed (“The White Tiger”) and the family adventure flick (“We Can Be Heroes”) to international series popular with American audiences (“Lupin”).<br />(Netflix)<br />“We Can Be Heroes” is a film about a group of kids with unique, otherworldly powers—stretching their bodies, fast-forwarding and rewinding time, shaping water—who are enlisted to save the world from an alien invasion after their parents’ superhero crew is captured. It was an instant hit when it was released on Netflix on Christmas. It immediately started bouncing around the service’s top-10 list and has already been given the green light for a sequel.<br />The movie was written, directed and produced by Robert Rodriguez, a creative force behind adult hits like “Once Upon a Time in Mexico” and “From Dusk Till Dawn,” as well as all-ages fare like the “Spy Kids” franchise. Mr. Rodriguez says it got a lot harder to make family fare for traditional studios after 2005’s “The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D” disappointed at the box office. But he says Netflix reached out, told him that these were the kinds of movies that subscribers were watching over and over again, and asked if he’d like to make something for them in that genre. He pounced.<br />Mr. Rodriguez says kids are used to being taken to PG-13 superhero movies that “aren’t really made for them,” but thinks it’s important for them to see kids like themselves in these roles on screen.</td>

He was charged by federal authorities with 33 counts of trade-secret theft in August 2019, but a judge ruled that he wouldn’t have to report to prison during the pandemic.<br />The pardon was supported by venture capitalist Peter Thiel and entrepreneur Palmer Luckey, who founded Oculus VR, according to the White House.<br />—Preetika Rana</td>

      <td>Congress should raise the top corporate rate to 28%, but only for the most profitable companies.</td>
      <td>With President Biden in office and Democrats controlling the Senate, you can expect the new administration to propose a new tax bill soon, including an increase in the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%.<br />This bill will be easier to pass, and do less harm to the economy, if it exempts small businesses from the increase. Small businesses have been the hardest hit by the Covid-19 crisis, particularly in the retail and restaurant industries. By comparison, America’s largest companies have had fairly smooth sailing the past year. Many giants, including  Amazon  and  Home Depot ,  are actually benefiting from the pandemic.<br />Higher taxes on smaller firms would mean less investment in the part of the economy that has traditionally generated the most jobs. With nearly 11 million Americans unemployed, this shouldn’t be overlooked. On top of that, the Treasury wouldn’t have to give up much revenue. Nearly 90% of corporate income tax each year is paid by the nation’s largest 25,000 firms. The remaining 10% or so is paid by about six million smaller companies.<br />There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a small business. But one way the White House and Congress could proceed on corporate taxes would be to apply the proposed increase only to businesses with annual pretax profit of, say, $2.5 million or more. According to my analysis of data from the Internal Revenue Service, that cutoff would allow the Treasury to collect as much as 90% of the gain in corporate tax revenue envisioned under the current Biden plan. So about 25,000 firms would move from a 21% corporate rate to a 28% rate, while nearly six million smaller companies would see no change in their corporate income-tax rate.<br />But about 30 million owners of businesses, most of them very small outfits, would not be affected by an increase in the corporate tax rate because they run their firms as limited liability companies, partnerships or sole proprietorships. The owners of these “pass-through entities” pay taxes on their company profits through their personal income taxes, and many of them benefited from the Trump tax cuts a few years ago, particularly from the 20% deduction on qualified business income. The Biden administration and Congress would be smart to make sure that only the very largest of these 30 million businesses—say, those with more than $2.5 million in annual profit—lose this deduction. That would ensure that America’s largest and most successful companies, whether they are organized as traditional corporations or pass-through entities, pay higher taxes, while the overwhelming majority do not.</td>

      <td>The Senate erroneously asserted jurisdiction once, but dissenting members forced an acquittal.</td>
      <td>Now that Donald Trump is a private citizen, the Senate should dismiss the article of impeachment against him for lack of jurisdiction. The Constitution is clear: “The president . . . shall be removed from office on impeachment . . . and conviction”—not by the expiration of his term before the impeachment process is complete. It also mandates that “judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal and disqualification“—not or disqualification.<br />When the Constitution was written, several states allowed impeachment of former officials. The Framers could easily have included that provision, but they didn’t. They also explicitly chose to prohibit the British practice of trial by legislature—excepting only impeachment—and “bill of attainder,” any punitive legislative act against a specific person. The courts have held that the punishments prohibited by the Bill of Attainder Clause include disqualification from holding office. Moreover, the Constitution requires the chief justice to preside “when the president of the United States is tried.”<br />No former official has ever been convicted by the Senate, and only one has been impeached. Secretary of War William W. Belknap was indisputably guilty of numerous impeachable offences, to which he confessed as he resigned his office hours before the House unanimously impeached him in 1876. The Senate voted in favor of a procedural motion affirming its jurisdiction to try Belknap’s impeachment. But two dozen senators who believed he was guilty voted to acquit on jurisdictional grounds. A close vote nearly a century and a half ago doesn’t establish a binding precedent.<br />A more compelling precedent is the House’s decision not to impeach Richard Nixon. After he left office in 1974 to avoid certain impeachment and conviction, there was no movement to continue the process.<br />Beyond the constitution, there are strong policy and historical reasons an incoming administration shouldn’t seek recriminations against its predecessor. In some countries defeated former presidents and prime ministers are routinely prosecuted. America has lived more in accordance with President Lincoln’s message to the soon-to-be-defeated Confederacy: “With Malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds.”</td>

      <td>Now available to watch online, the Atlanta Opera’s in-person performances embraced Covid-19 restrictions as a creative challenge.</td>
      <td><br /><br />The Atlanta Opera has been one of the few American companies to perform live for in-person audiences during the Covid-19 pandemic. Last fall, using a custom-built, open-sided tent situated on a university baseball field and following rigorous coronavirus protocols, the company gave 17 performances of two one-act operas—Leoncavallo’s “Pagliacci” and Viktor Ullman’s “The Kaiser of Atlantis,” played on alternate days—as well as three concerts. The salaried Atlanta Opera Company Players—a dozen top singers who live in the Atlanta area—and the six members of its young artist program comprise the casts of all the company’s live and digital events.<br />Films of the live operas and concerts, plus some additional videos, are being distributed on the company’s new Spotlight Media platform , at various price points. “Kaiser,” which is available now, along with the “Mezzo Extravaganza” concert, demonstrates how imaginative direction can harness Covid restrictions for artistic effect.<br />Ullmann’s sardonic 60-minute opera, with a libretto by Peter Kien, was composed in 1943 in the Nazi “show” camp Terezín but not performed until 1975 (the creators were killed in Auschwitz). The circus-themed production is directed by Tomer Zvulun, the company’s general and artistic director, with scenic design by Julia Noulin-Mérat, costumes by Joanna Schmink, and lighting by Ben Rawson. It skillfully juxtaposes Holocaust references (mountains of discarded shoes) with the visual signals of our current plague era (masks and four movable booths with clear vinyl sides). Singers inside the booths wear no masks; outside them, other singers and circus performers, all masked, stagger through a seemingly toxic landscape. The despotic Kaiser’s reign has produced a land where life and death are equally meaningless. Drunk with power, he decrees a total war that will kill everyone, but Death, angry at not being consulted, goes on strike. As a result, the populace, afflicted by battle and disease, cannot die.</td>

      <td>Possible offering comes amid a monthslong rally in precious-metal prices</td>
      <td>Russian gold miner Nord Gold UK Societas, or Nordgold, is looking to list in London as early as this summer, capitalizing on the precious metal’s long price run to become the largest mining company to float globally in at least five years, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Nordgold’s initial public offering could value it at more than $5 billion and would float over 25% of the company, some of these people say. With two Canadian gold miners moving their listing to the U.K., Nordgold’s IPO is a boost for London’s financial district amid concerns that Brexit makes it less attractive.<br />A spokesman for the U.K.-domiciled company, which has 10 mines in Africa, Russia and Kazakhstan, said it is evaluating various strategic options, which may include an IPO on the  London Stock Exchange .  He declined to comment further.<br />The company has already hired banks to lead the IPO, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bacchus Capital is Nordgold’s financial adviser for the possible offering.<br />Gold has fallen 8.5% since highs last August, but the precious metal is up 57% since the summer of 2018. That long rally has been fueled by ultralow interest rates, which make gold more competitive against yield-bearing investments, and as investors looked for havens amid the spread of the coronavirus.</td>

He said he wished the new administration “great luck and success” and added: “I hope they don’t raise your taxes, but if they do—I told you so.”</td>

      <td>HUMANS HAVE composted food for about as long as they have grown it. But in a world increasingly obsessed with tidy convenience, many view the chore of converting food waste into fertilizer for plants and gardens much as they do tending to kombucha scoby or committing to cloth diapers for their infants: too time-consuming, too “granola” and too plain icky.<br />Composting has “been perceived as this very stinky project that takes a bunch of time and only makes sense if you have a big backyard,” said Friday Apaliski, a San Francisco “sustainability concierge” who works with clients to make their homes more green. She believes that people “are starting to understand how truly phenomenal composting is.”<br />Indeed, new composting technology has emerged that makes the process easier, faster and more stylish. Some composting systems are now small enough to live on your kitchen’s countertop and sufficiently attractive that you won’t mind looking at them day after day.<br />And with houseplant ownership skyrocketing (compost is just as good for Instagramable succulents as for an old-time vegetable garden) and a growing desire to reduce methane-producing food waste, more Americans are trying the ancient practice out for themselves. Between 2014 and 2019, according to the 2019 Composting in America report, the number of American communities offering composting programs increased 65%. This summer, Vermont became the first state in the nation to make composting mandatory.<br />If you’re going to do it, why not do it as pleasantly as possible?

Mr. Bahrani, the director of movies including “Chop Shop” and “Man Push Cart,” was blown away by the story of Balram Halwai, who goes to work as a driver for a rich Indian family and charts a violent path out of poverty.<br />“The lead character, Balram Halwai, jumps out of the page,” said Mr. Bahrani, whose film of “The White Tiger” begins streaming Friday on  Netflix .  “He’s so complex and funny and sarcastic and dark. And his journey from poverty and from nothing to a successful entrepreneur was full of so many weird twists and turns that you don’t know where to sit with them at the end of the novel.”<br />Mr. Bahrani, who wrote the screenplay and directed “The White Tiger,” talked about getting to know his protagonist better while making the film.

      <td>IN MY DREAMS, my laundry room is airy and bright, with wooden folding tables and shelves with baskets to intelligently organize detergents, sewing supplies, my ironing board and clothespins. In other words, it would resemble a modest-size Apple store, except with a whole section devoted to orphan socks.<br />But the laundry room in my reality is a hellhole. It’s a tiny closet, actually, where space is so tight I can barely close the door on the stacked machines that I jammed in there. They hulk, stupidly, among other random items including the vacuum, an empty guitar case and a weird bed coverlet known as “the meat blanket” because its mottled pink-and-white pattern resembles a slice of Mortadella sausage.<br />Worst of all, though, is the washing machine, which smells like mildew because its rubber seal is a moisture trap—a defect I came to learn over the past eight years is common in front loaders, and in this model in particular.<br />So it was actually good news a few weeks ago when the washer broke.<br />“Mrmffk, grnnnn…faulty shut-off valve,” the masked repairman seemed to say through his N95 mask. He also managed to convey to me that fixing the problem would cost upward of $600—nearly as much as I paid for the machine when it was new.</td>

      <td>Everything is going  Procter & Gamble ’s  way. Investors should ask whether this is as good as it gets for a while.<br />The consumer-products giant on Wednesday reported excellent earnings for the three months through December. Organic sales, which adjust for currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 8% from a year earlier. The company raised its sales guidance for the full fiscal year ending in June to a range of 5% to 6% growth from 3% to 4% previously and boosted its share-buyback plans.<br />The maker of Tide detergent, Bounty paper towels and Charmin toilet paper has benefited handsomely from the coronavirus pandemic. And thanks to its diverse portfolio, even categories such as shaving and beauty, not natural beneficiaries of the stay-at-home economy, have performed reasonably well. Grooming, for instance, saw 6% organic sales growth in the quarter thanks to surging sales for appliances like electric razors as consumers continue to shun barbers.<br />Yet P&G shares were basically flat in morning trading and are down around 6% since P&G reported similarly stellar results three months ago. Investors rightly worry that sales of household staples will fall as the pandemic fades and that its shares remain somewhat expensive at 23 times forward earnings, according to FactSet.<br />Perhaps a bigger challenge for the stock is that it doesn’t look like a good fit for any post-pandemic market narrative. In a reflationary boom, it wouldn’t benefit from the likely rotation into value stocks and cyclicals. Under a stagnation scenario it might normally be attractive as a steady dividend payer, but its current 2.4% yield isn’t especially enticing compared with other consumer-staples companies at the moment—particularly food and beverage stocks:  Coca-Cola ’s  yield is 3.4%,  General Mills ’ 3.7%, and  PepsiCo ’s  2.9%.</td>

The coronavirus pandemic halted the 11-year economic expansion and drove up unemployment just as the typical American household was starting to enjoy sustained income growth. Americans were living longer—an improvement from a period when the opioid crisis eroded life expectancy—until the pandemic exacted a swift, deadly toll. One government official said life expectancy could decline by the largest amount since World War II once the government completes last year’s mortality figures.<br />Long-running demographic trends also have shaped the country. The U.S. is becoming more racially diverse. More Americans are obtaining college degrees. Women are having fewer babies, and the population is growing at its lowest rate in over a century.<br />After stagnating in the wake of the 2007-09 recession, America’s earnings gradually improved starting around the middle of the last decade. Median household income was $68,700 in 2019, up 6.8% from the prior year and the highest figure on record. The poverty rate that year dipped to its lowest level since the government began tracking it in 1959. Last year’s figures are expected to show disparities in whose incomes suffered, with some households being better off because of stimulus payments and extra unemployment benefits.<br />The stock market has marched to near-record highs, lifting the net worth of investors while leaving behind the nearly one half of Americans who don’t own stock. Consumer debt has climbed as families have borrowed more heavily to stay in the middle class.</td>

On Tuesday, rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported a fourth-quarter profit that was more than twice as large as year-earlier results and annual revenue that was at an 11-year high.<br />With its focus on wealthy Americans and big corporations and money managers, Morgan Stanley is less exposed to mass unemployment and small-business closures than more Main Street banks.<br />Stock- and bond-trading revenue at Morgan Stanley rose 32% to $4.22 billion.

He took out bank loans worth €80,000, equivalent to $96,000, put his 10 employees on a government wage-support program and hoped for the best.<br />Almost a year later, with doors still closed, Mr. Ríos worries his business will fold, leaving him with a pile of debt and exposing his banks to losses. “We are resisting thanks to savings and bank loans, but we can’t keep like this much longer,” the 59-year-old entrepreneur said.<br />His story is echoed across Europe as small businesses fight to stay afloat through the pandemic. Their survival is key for the region’s banks, which together have over €2 trillion on loan to them—40% of the lenders’ entire business loan books.<br />Overall, lenders have considerably cleaned up bad loans from the previous crisis, but many are still stuck with souring portfolios. They are also struggling to make money in a negative-rates environment.<br />Regulators fear a new—and potentially bigger—wave of defaults could send banks scrambling to cover losses. Weaker ones could require state help to survive. Andrea Enria, the head of banking supervision at the European Central Bank, has warned that bad loans in the eurozone could soar to as high as €1.4 trillion—more than during the aftermath of the financial crisis—if the economy contracts more than expected.</td>

      <td>Investors don’t want to miss out on the luxury sector’s next Gucci-style brand turnaround. Still, their strong preference for  Prada  SpA over  Burberry  Group, both of which are in the middle of revamps, is a puzzle.<br />On Wednesday, Burberry said comparable retail sales fell 9% in its most recent quarter compared with the prior-year period. Even though the numbers were weaker than analysts expected, there are also early signs that the company’s efforts to shift more stock at full price are beginning to pay off. If the British trench-coat brand can reduce the number of products it has to sell at a discount, profit margins should improve.<br />Burberry stock rose slightly in European morning trading, but it still has a long way to go to catch up with Prada. The Milanese label is the best-performing large luxury stock of the past 12 months, gaining 67%, while Burberry is one of the worst. Prada’s shares have traditionally been more expensive than its British peer’s, but the premium has skyrocketed in recent months.<br />There isn’t much hard evidence yet to justify investors’ faith in Prada. Earlier this month, the company said its retail sales fell 6% in the second half of 2020—better than Burberry’s latest numbers, but not by much. True, there are some indications that Prada is getting more attention on social media. It ranked fourth in a recent Citi Brand Heat Tracker, while Burberry languished in 14th place. The question is whether this will translate into meaningful market-share gains as more consumers emerge from lockdowns this year.<br />Investors may favor Prada because its operating margins have been high in the past, peaking at 27% almost a decade ago. The business hasn’t been that lucrative in years, but as the Italian label makes a bigger cut of sales from highly profitable handbags, shareholders may be betting it can return to those highs. Burberry, by contrast, has a heritage in clothing, where margins are lower. Takeover speculation could also explain excitement about Prada, although its controlling shareholder has said the brand isn’t for sale.</td>

Valuations have touched levels seen only in the years surrounding the dot-com bubble and in the run-up to the 1929 crash.<br />It is an apt example of how the stock market’s link to the economy can be as thin as tissue paper. Even the idea that stocks are pricing in an expected boom in the economy once the pandemic passes is looking pretty flimsy as stocks don’t just look rich versus analysts’ expected 2021 earnings but versus expected earnings in 2022.<br />If stocks can be so divorced from the economy as it struggles through the coronavirus crisis, they also can be detached from it when the pandemic lessens its grip. With another round of fiscal support looking likely, and vaccinations under way, economists have been marking up their economic growth forecasts for this year. There is no rule that says that should send stocks higher, though.<br />To some extent stocks might have done well not just despite the pandemic, but because of it. The big companies represented in the major stock indexes were, in large part, less affected than many small businesses. Goods sectors such as manufacturing, which are a bigger part of the market than of the economy as a whole, have fared better than services. So it might be businesses underrepresented in the stock market that are the bigger beneficiaries of a better economy this year.</td>

      <td>Athletes arrive as country reduces the number of international arrivals allowed</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—International tennis stars jetted into Australia last week from some of the world’s worst coronavirus hot spots. At the same time, ordinary Australians were prohibited from traveling between the country’s two biggest cities because of a small outbreak in one of them.<br />Australia’s tough border controls have been credited with helping the country to contain the coronavirus. Now, Australia’s decision to let hundreds of tennis players into the country ahead of the Australian Open, one of the biggest tennis tournaments in the world, is serving up a public debate on whether some people are getting preferential treatment.<br />“It feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth,” said Julie Land, 42 years old, who has been trying to return to Australia from the U.S. with her family and will have to wait until at least March for an available flight. “Cricket players, tennis entourages and celebrities seem to have no issues at all accessing Australia.”<br />How Australia balances the needs of athletes with anger from some members of the public could offer lessons for other global sports tournaments due to be held this year. Japan, another country with a low number of coronavirus cases by international standards, is scheduled to host the Olympics in July, after they were postponed last year.<br />The tournament is an economic driver for Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city. Last year, more than 800,000 people attended, and organizers estimated that about $300 million was injected into the local economy. Broadcasts of the tournament reached more than 900 million homes globally.</td>

      <td>UnitedHealth Group Inc.  recorded a smaller profit for the last quarter of 2020 as the company had to pay more in medical costs to cover insured members who returned in greater numbers to doctors’ offices after putting off care earlier in the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The Minnetonka, Minn., health-care company, the parent of insurer UnitedHealthcare as well as the Optum health-services business, said Wednesday that the pandemic dragged on revenue growth from commercial insurance customers last year as its economic fallout disrupted the labor market. But revenue grew overall for the company’s insurance business in the year amid expansion of its programs to serve communities and seniors.<br />Fourth-quarter revenue for UnitedHealth climbed to $65.47 billion, up from $60.9 billion in the same quarter a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast revenue of $64.96 billion.<br />UnitedHealth’s revenue from premiums grew to $50.58 billion, from $47.63 billion a year earlier. The company also logged higher revenue from products, services and investment income than it did in the year-ago quarter.<br />As more people returned to medical providers for care that they had avoided or postponed earlier in the pandemic, UnitedHealth’s costs rose as well. Medical costs climbed to $42.08 billion, up from $39.28 billion in the year-ago period. Operating costs increased to $11.51 billion, from $9.3 billion in the previous year’s fourth quarter.</td>

      <td>A Democratic majority in both chambers of Congress, even with narrow margins, could open the door to some potentially transformative clean-energy policies</td>
      <td>The narrow Democratic Party majority in Congress might close the door on some of President-elect Joe Biden’s most ambitious clean-energy proposals, but it opens one up for tax-policy changes. That alone could supercharge the industry.<br />Tax and spending measures can pass through a simple majority in the Senate through a budget-reconciliation process, which is why many industry watchers are focused on it. Notably, there are tax provisions that passed the Democrat-controlled House in July but never made it onto the Senate’s agenda when it was Republican-controlled.<br />One such measure worth watching includes an investment tax credit for energy storage. Keith Martin, a partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, notes that the provision is well-developed and has momentum behind it. Today, energy storage qualifies for the tax credits only if it is paired with solar energy, and there are finicky rules to prove eligibility. Such rules have meant battery systems that exist solely for grid services, for example, were shut out entirely.<br />An investment tax credit for energy storage has been on the clean-energy industry’s wish list for years and is a potential game-changer. The lack of cheap storage remains one of the key bottlenecks to a grid that relies primarily on intermittent solar and wind energy. Though battery technologies have become cheaper over the years, tax credits would increase its competitiveness. A tax credit for stand-alone energy storage could translate to 16% growth in the U.S. energy-storage market, according to a Wood Mackenzie report from 2019. The Solar Energy Industry Association credits the same subsidy for allowing the solar industry to grow by more than 10,000% since it was enacted in 2006.<br />Another potential measure is a longer extension of existing renewable tax credits. While a stimulus bill passed in late December included one-year and two-year extensions for tax credits commonly used by onshore wind- and solar-power plants, respectively, the House infrastructure bill passed last year included a five-year extension for both. A further extension could be a relatively easy win given that renewable tax credits have a history of receiving bipartisan support. Experience has shown that longer visibility on tax credits allows the industry to grow without sudden stops.</td>

The unit’s brands include Tide, Mr. Clean, Dawn dish soap and Cascade dishwasher detergent. Sales in P&G’s grooming unit, which includes Gillette razors, rose 5%.

      <td>Spectrum auction will cost carriers about $95 billion, but payoff is uncertain</td>
      <td>Wireless carriers clearly believe their own press about 5G. And they are wagering a huge sum to prove it.<br />The latest auction of wireless spectrum licenses by the Federal Communications Commission ended on Friday with a total of $80.9 billion. Adding in an estimated $13 billion to $14 billion in clearing costs to help move satellite operators to new frequencies will bring the total bill for this latest auction to around $95 billion—roughly triple what many analysts had projected. All for the purpose of securing the necessary capacity for the latest standard of wireless networking known as 5G.<br />Much remains undisclosed at the moment, including how much each carrier bid for what slices of spectrum. But analysts agree that  AT&T  and  Verizon  likely paid the most—because they needed the most. A trio of brokers who published estimates on Tuesday averaged a guess of $22 billion in total final bids from AT&T and $42 billion from Verizon, including the clearing costs.  T-Mobile ,  which already has a strong 5G spectrum position thanks to last year’s merger with Sprint, is estimated to have spent around $10 billion. Full results from the auction aren’t expected to be public until sometime next month.<br />Winning the licenses is one thing; paying for them is another. AT&T currently has the fifth-highest dividend yield on the S&P 500, according to FactSet. It also has a pressing need to invest in its Hollywood operations that include the HBO Max streaming service. Doug Mitchelson of  Credit Suisse  wrote Tuesday that AT&T may need to find incremental asset sales to offset its spectrum bill, lest the carrier’s credit rating get downgraded to something close to junk status. Verizon isn’t under the same kind of pressure, but Mr. Mitchelson predicted that stock buybacks at Verizon are “now off the table for years.”<br />There also is the question of making 5G pay off. So far, the performance of those services hasn’t lived up to years of hype from carriers. A survey by UBS in October found that 5G ranked “among low priorities” of smartphone users—below that of battery life and other functions. Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson notes that 5G revenue forecasts aren’t going up just because the spectrum costs came in much higher than expected. Those carriers also will still need to invest the necessary capital expenditures to make use of the spectrum. “Winning” the government’s recent auction may turn into more of a Pyrrhic victory.</td>

      <td>The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is finally under way. Markets are already showing that the speed of local rollouts matters quite a bit—but global vaccination campaigns will also ripple through financial markets in some unexpected ways, including in places that have successfully controlled the disease.<br />It is difficult to pin down the precise impact of vaccine deployment so far. In the past month, while the MSCI All Country World Index is up by 3.3%, benchmark equity indexes in Israel and Dubai, two places with among the fastest vaccine rollouts globally, are up by around 8% apiece. Clearly vaccines aren’t everything though: The Bahrain All Share Index is down a little more than 2% over the same period, despite a rapid rollout.<br />Markets where vaccines are rolled out rapidly may be beneficiaries, but the greater impact may be on the laggards. Hospitality, travel and bank stocks are key areas on which to concentrate.<br />The MSCI World Banks Index has clearly been a major beneficiary of vaccine-related good news this winter: The index’s gain since the beginning of 2020 still lags behind the broad MSCI World by 22 percentage points. But it has clawed back more than a third of the 35 percentage-point gap that existed in mid-October.<br />As deployment continues, the difficult question of whether some vaccines are more effective than others also will come to the fore. Late-stage trial data from Brazil suggest that the Sinovac vaccine, CoronaVac, met the World Health Organization’s benchmark for widespread use by a whisker, with an efficacy rate of 50.4%.</td>

Now, the U.K. hopes it is turning the tide, thanks to a homegrown vaccine that has yet to be authorized elsewhere in the West.<br />More than four million of the most at-risk people in the U.K., almost 8% of the adult population, have been vaccinated with at least one shot of vaccine.<br />Among them are more than half of the frailest group of all: the 300,000 elderly residents of nursing homes who can’t travel to get a shot. The key to reaching them has been mobile vaccination teams armed with a shot developed by the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC.<br />Together with a network of family doctors and vaccination hubs in sports centers, hotels and cathedrals, this shot has helped the country to stay on track toward a target of vaccinating its 15 million most vulnerable people by mid-February.<br />The government says the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has also been authorized in India, Morocco and some countries in Latin America, has been a game changer in reaching people tucked away in smaller nursing homes.</td>

The group acquired the annuities unit in 2018 from  Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.<br />Sixth Street, a former affiliate of private-equity firm TPG, has amassed one of the biggest pools of private capital on record. Sixth Street raised more than $12 billion for its flagship fund, known as Tao, last year, bringing the total to $25 billion. Its base is pension funds and other institutional investors.<br />Talcott currently has more than $90 billion in liabilities and surplus for its approximately 900,000 customers.<br />Since the world-wide financial crisis of 2008, private-equity, asset-management and other types of financial firms have scooped up blocks of life-insurance policies and annuities, and even entire operating units, as insurers narrowed their focus and divested product lines. Ultralow interest rates have prompted much of the activity, hurting insurers’ profits. One of the biggest of the postcrisis upstarts is  Athene Holding Ltd. , backed by  Apollo Global Management Inc.  and now a large publicly traded insurer.</td>
