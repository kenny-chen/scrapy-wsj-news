It wasn’t released in other territories right away—getting permission for the source material turned out to be an enormous headache—but “Since I Left You” circulated freely on file-sharing sites and was already recognized as a classic by the time it came out in the U.S. late in 2001. As indie records go, it was an enormous success—it reached the U.K. top 10 and made many best-of-decade lists—and the group’s members regularly assured fans that they were hard at work on a follow-up that was coming soon. But the second Avalanches LP, the solid but less impressive “Wildflower,” didn’t arrive until 16 years later, so it was hard to hold your breath waiting for album number three. “We Will Always Love You” (Astralwerks), out Friday, is the band’s new LP, and it rewards that patience.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Federal Communications Commission dedicated $9.2 billion to fund construction of rural broadband networks over the next decade, in what the agency’s leader called the biggest ever U.S. step to extend high-speed internet service.<br />The funding will go to internet service providers, from established rural operators such as Windstream Holdings Inc. to newcomers such as cable provider  Charter Communications Inc.  and Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The companies bid against each other in an auction designed to steer public money to the company willing to build the fastest network in each area at the lowest cost.<br />“I’m thrilled with the incredible success of this auction, which brings welcome news to millions of unconnected rural Americans who for too long have been on the wrong side of the digital divide. They now stand to gain access to high-speed, high-quality broadband service,” said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai.<br />The providers have 10 years to build the networks, with incentives to do so sooner rather than later. The FCC said the auction covered more than 5 million homes and businesses in 49 states. In about 85% of locations, the providers promised ultrafast “gigabit” speed, the agency said. Most of the remaining locations would see download speeds of at least 100 megabits a second, capable of large downloads.<br />Of the 180 companies that made successful bids, LTD Broadband LLC secured the most funding—about $1.3 billion—to serve more than 500,000 homes and businesses. The company has previously used tower-mounted “fixed wireless” technology. Charter, operator of the Spectrum brand, secured about $1.2 billion to serve more than 1 million locations across 24 states. A consortium of rural electric companies won about $1.1 billion.</td>

Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), followed a Wall Street Journal article that said Google was weighing severe penalties against IAC, under Chairman Barry Diller, for software it created for Google’s Chrome web browser. An internal Google audit found that IAC extensions—external applications ostensibly installed to provide weather updates or Bible verses—often don’t provide users the functions they promised and direct them to advertising.<br />The IAC products frequently change a users’ default search engine from Google to IAC’s own search site, sparking confusion and complaints from users, Google’s trust and safety team found in the audit. Beyond the Google investigators’ concerns about the utility of the browser extensions, the review found that the software had been marketed via ads placed on Google that falsely claimed to help users register to vote, find a polling place or apply for a coronavirus stimulus check.<br />“Given the troubling practices discovered by Google’s trust and safety audit, your company’s continued financial relationship with IAC raises serious questions,” Mr. Wyden wrote to Mr. Pichai. He asked for the answers to nine questions, including whether Google executives overruled internal recommendations to take action against IAC.<br />A Google spokesman earlier said it was still reviewing the issue.</td>

You have to be in line with the speaker!’ ”<br />At the time, Mrs. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders backed a $2.4 trillion bill passed by the House, and negotiations continued. A deal never came together, derailed by the politics of the approaching election and policy debates over testing for the virus, funding for state and local governments and other issues.<br />Senate Republicans also made clear they would support spending only around $500 billion, putting them out of step with the Trump administration.</td>

The average investment-grade corporate bond yielded just 1.85%, according to Bloomberg Barclays data.<br />So-called real yields—or the return investors can expect on bonds after adjusting for inflation—have been below zero for months on U.S. government debt. But last week marked the first time in records going back to 2003 that the phenomenon ever extended to a broad index of corporate bonds.<br />The two situations are related; negative real yields on U.S. Treasurys drive investors to buy riskier assets in search of better returns. Many have turned to corporate bonds, driving yields to new lows in recent months, investors and analysts say.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury inflation protected security—a proxy for real Treasury yields—is currently around minus-0.97%. That means investors can still pick up a meaningful amount of return by buying corporate bonds.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—White House trade adviser Peter Navarro knowingly violated the law when he criticized then-presidential candidate Joe Biden earlier this year in television appearances and on social media while in his official capacity as a government employee, according to federal investigators.<br />In a report released on Monday, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, a permanent office of investigators and prosecutors, found that Mr. Navarro had violated the Hatch Act by using his authority as a Trump administration official to influence the 2020 presidential election.<br />The 1939 ethics law restricts federal employees’ political activity and their use of federal resources for politics. While violations can have career-ending consequences for lower-level federal employees, top officials have rarely faced significant punishment for breaching it.<br />The report identifies six media interviews from May 2020 to October 2020 in which Mr. Navarro appeared in his official capacity and criticized Mr. Biden or his then-running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris. “Dr. Navarro often attacked Mr. Biden about his relationship with China and at times accused him of being ‘compromised’ and susceptible to being ‘bought’ by China, even nicknaming him ‘Beijing Biden,’ ” the report says. Mr. Navarro launched similar criticisms of Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris on his official  Twitter  account, according to the report.<br />The Office of Special Counsel sent its findings to President Trump for disciplinary action. The White House declined to comment on the report, and Mr. Navarro didn’t respond to a request for comment. The Office of Special Counsel’s report said Mr. Navarro chose not to formally respond to its allegations.</td>

      <td>An increasing number of companies are looking at an innovative approach to deal with hackers that break into their computer networks. They lure cybercriminals into thinking they’re getting close to the good stuff—and then they trap them.<br />That’s what Land O’Lakes, the suburban Minneapolis agricultural giant, is doing.<br />“Manufacturing-plant technology is difficult to protect, because those mills, generators and turbines were built 20 years ago with little consideration for security,” says Land O’ Lakes Chief Information-Security Officer Tony Taylor. If a hacker shuts down a dairy plant, “we lose hundreds of gallons of milk that we’ve already paid for. And we can’t make any butter.”<br />So, the company uses a tool called DeceptionGrid, created by Boston-based cybersecurity shop TrapX. The technology deploys an array of decoys and booby traps throughout the Land O’ Lakes network that mimic crucial information, to convince hackers that they have gotten access to the company’s crown jewels.<br />“Once any of the [decoys] are accessed or probed in any way, one centralized console alerts us, so we know to start investigating the source of that activity,” says Mr. Taylor. His team can then contain the intruder.</td>

      <td>Regarding your editorial “GM Drives in Political Reverse” (Nov. 27): General Motors CEO Mary Barra in pulling GM’s support for the legal challenge to California’s electric-car mandate made two major capitulations. First to California, which already has environmental policies that often lead to darkness and blackouts, but now with GM’s help the state will have more leverage in dictating the automobile market for the entire country. Second, to appease the expected political overlords of a Biden administration and EPA who will dictate the product portfolio of automobiles produced versus the market via mandates and regulatory credits.<br />The socialization of the U.S. automobile market is intensifying. More and more the CEOs of auto companies will seek the conformity of political regulators and woke PR gestures instead of providing what customers really want. Increasingly there will be a dependence of revenue based on what the government gives them in credits or takes away in penalties rather than what makes real profit. Those of us on the retail end of the car business for decades know this because we deal with real customers.<br />Electric cars are a part of the future but should compete on their own merits and not have to count on elevated sales due to heavy-handed regulations on their competition. Both the consumer and the environment have always benefited more from fair market competition of evolving technologies than the virtuous regulators and CEOs who try to appease them. Imagine if in the 1800s the government mandated steam engines as the way of the future and regulated out the alternatives. The automobile industry shouldn’t be constrained with that mind-set and certainly not with the dictates from a state which often can’t keep its electric lights on, as if it were still the 1800s.<br />Karl Miller<br />Mount Vernon, N.Y.</td>

This product, however, is far from new. MI Plus was first launched in 2004 by the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency—a state-sponsored agency comparable to the Federal Housing Administration. MI Plus has helped over a thousand Massachusetts homeowners avoid foreclosure after losing their jobs and incomes.<br />This Massachusetts borrower-benefit insurance has passed the actuarial test—at a zero incremental premium over the Massachusetts Mortgage Insurance Fund’s standard lender-paid insurance premium which covers the lender’s foreclosure-related losses. Avoiding a homeowner’s foreclosure is mitigating a mortgage lender’s loss. This product has great promise—if state governments will cooperate.<br />As a former mortgage insurance risk-management executive and consultant for an international management consulting firm, I have helped senior housing-finance officials in over a dozen developing countries examine how mortgage-default insurance can induce private lenders to expand access to home financing by families of modest means. Many expressed particular interest in the Massachusetts foreclosure-avoidance model, which provides complementary credit-insurance benefits to lender and borrower.<br />Roger Blood</td>

Asked earlier Monday about reports of the sanctions ahead of their announcement, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in Beijing condemned such moves as meddling in China’s sovereign affairs and defended the Chinese legislature as acting in accordance with the constitution and laws.<br />The National People’s Congress Standing Committee officials are responsible for a new national security law imposed on Hong Kong that the State Department said “effectively neutered the ability of the people of Hong Kong to choose their elected representatives.”</td>

It also exceeds total penalties paid by all prior violators of the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule to the government, the DOJ added.<br />“We have long taken our compliance with telemarketing laws seriously and we maintain rigorous telemarketing compliance procedures and policies,” the company said Monday. “While we respectfully disagree with the underlying liability judgment, which involved telemarketing calls made between 2003 and 2011, this matter is now resolved.”<br />The company last week said in a securities filing that it had already set aside the fine amount, and that it has until Jan. 3 to pay the penalties.</td>

      <td>Payments company Square has released a line of clothes named after its digital wallet</td>
      <td>If someone is asking for “just cash” this year, you can still surprise them with a fluorescent camouflage sweatshirt from Cash by Cash App, an apparel collection that has recently been unveiled by payments company  Square .<br />Named after Square’s multipurpose digital wallet application, the collection features brightly colored T-shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies and other apparel. It appears already largely sold out or low in stock. The move comes after the Cash App has recently been name-checked in hip-hop songs.<br />But before investors panic about a pivot by the highly valued payments upstart to the lower-margin clothing business, consider an analysis by Mizuho’s Dan Dolev in a recent note. “What is more plausible is that this could be a test for a closed-loop e-commerce checkout button,” he wrote. Or, as Mr. Dolev put it, a “clothed loop.”<br />Mr. Dolev noted that not only can buyers purchase the clothing using the Cash App, they also get a 25% discount for doing so. One longtime ambition of some Square investors has been to see the company evolve further into having an app that is used by both consumers and merchants to make and receive payments in a transaction, effectively controlling both sides of the purchase. The collection’s site was also built using Square’s online store software.<br />Gross payment volume that includes Cash App use for business purposes was already up 332% in the third quarter from a year earlier to $2.9 billion, according to the company. The real gift might be to Square’s investors if shopping with Cash App becomes a holiday habit.</td>

      <td>ROME—Pope Francis will make the first papal visit to Iraq in March, to support the country’s Christian minority and urge peace and reconciliation in a nation racked by years of sectarian violence, including partial occupation by Islamic State militants.<br />It will be the pope’s first international trip since before the Covid-19 pandemic, and one that potentially poses health and security challenges for the pontiff, his entourage and the local population.<br />The Vatican said on Monday the pope would visit Baghdad, the cities of Erbil, Mosul and Qaraqosh, and “the plain of Ur, linked to the memory of Abraham.”<br />The trip, scheduled for March 5-8, would be Pope Francis’s first venture outside of Italy since November 2019, when he visited Japan. He has left Vatican City only rarely since the start of the pandemic.<br />The exact program of events will take into account the state of the global pandemic, the Vatican said. Vatican officials declined to say whether the pope plans to appear at public events that would draw crowds. Papal trips typically feature public Masses with congregations of thousands of people, even in countries without a Catholic majority.</td>

      <td>A stream of football players are ending their collegiate careers early to dodge Covid and prepare for the pros.</td>
      <td>Last June, Minnesota wide receiver Rashod Bateman couldn’t sleep. He buzzed with nervous thoughts about whether the coronavirus pandemic would tackle the 2020 college football season, likely his final one before turning pro.<br />Then his nerves became feverish sweats, body aches and chills. Like hundreds of thousands of other Americans, Bateman had a symptomatic case of Covid-19. “I’m back healthy and everything is fine, but I still feel like there is some residue left from Covid,” he said this week. “It still has some type of effect on my body because of my asthma.”<br />So when an outbreak of at least 49 cases decimated the tail end of Minnesota’s schedule, Bateman decided not to take any chances. He opted out of the season on Nov. 26 to get ready for the next stage of his career. “With only a few games left and Covid spiking, I thought it was best to step aside and start my professional career,” he said.<br />Bateman is part of a growing roster of players that are walking away from their college football careers—deep into the season, as the College Football Playoff race takes shape and coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths reach record highs in the United States.<br />In the last two weeks, more than a dozen athletes from college football’s top five conferences–the Atlantic Coast, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-12 and Southeastern Conferences–have opted out. They hail from programs like Texas, Florida State, Kentucky and Central Florida. And they join more than 150 other players who made the same choice this summer.</td>

The end of the Covid-19 pandemic is in sight, but we aren’t there yet.<br />The country learned a hard lesson early on about the fragility of global supply chains. Available information about the disease changed with every passing week, making a national consensus on the public-health response impossible to achieve. Testing protocols, policies and capacity varied within and among states, and the U.S., for the most part, doesn’t test people as often as it should. Kids and families have suffered as a result of sudden school closures and haphazard reopenings.<br />There have been bright spots. Some Americans made enormous sacrifices to protect their neighbors and colleagues. Even simple gestures like wearing masks, as most Americans do, saved lives. Doctors, nurses, hospital workers, long-term caregivers, first responders and emergency personnel proved to be what Americans always knew they were—the very best in the world at what they do. Businesses pivoted their operations in a matter of weeks to protect their workforces and provide vital products to fight the virus.<br />Politically, despite their many differences, Democrats and Republicans at the federal level came together to enact several relief packages, including the Cares Act, which rescued businesses, supported people who lost their jobs, funded food programs, invested in testing and tracing, and provided billions to state and local governments. It was a grand gesture, and for the most part, it worked.</td>

      <td>If they want workers to be more vigilant, fear doesn’t work. Fortunately, there are alternatives.</td>
      <td>Companies often turn to a powerful emotion to get employees to be vigilant about cybersecurity. They scare them.<br />If you do this, or don’t do that, something awful will happen. Click on phishing messages, and the company’s network will be exposed to hackers. Use simple passwords, and your personal files will get stolen.<br />The problem: Fear doesn’t work. Sure, it may get people to act in that moment. But scare tactics don’t get people invested in security over the long term, as Marc Dupuis of Washington University and I discovered in research last year.<br />In fact, it can do the opposite. That is because fear can leave employees in a constant state of anxiety, which makes them unable to think clearly about threats. Alternatively, such heavy-handed, scare messaging can make employees disgruntled and uninterested in security, thinking that the threats are exaggerated—and that bosses don’t trust them to do the right thing.<br />But fear not. Although scaring employees may not be an effective way to keep them vigilant, there are other tools that do work. First, let’s dig deeper into why fear doesn’t work.</td>

      <td>A community of rabid collectors and resellers are amassing old Patagonia fleeces, driving up the price for jackets in manic patterns and with particularly plush shells.</td>
      <td>FORGET BITCOIN. If you’re looking for a surefire investment right now, try buying and reselling old Patagonia fleeces. Kelsey Silverstein, 28, and Mark Donoher, 30, resold a Sea Turtle-patterned Snap-T fleece from 1996 for $165 about a year and a half ago. Today that same fleece could fetch more than $300 online. Rather than worry that they sold it too soon, the couple—who run Orbital Outdoors, an online clothing store dedicated to vintage outdoor gear—is looking ahead. “I’m hoarding the best stuff,” said Mr. Donoher who is convinced the market can only go up. “I think everything right now is just beginning.”<br />The Orbital pair are part of an ever-growing network of Patagonia flippers and collectors obsessed with pre-Y2K fleece. “I’m a freak when it comes to vintage Patagonia,” said Kyle Criscitello, 22, a reseller in Vienna, Va. Mr. Criscitello acquired his first Patagonia fleece as a teenager, but says he didn’t fully appreciate the Ventura, Calif.-based outdoor outfitter—founded by Vvon Chouinard in 1973—until he studied environmental design in college. “I got really into Yvon Chouinard and everything he is and stands for,” said Mr. Criscitello.<br />What Mr. Chouinard stands for—to Mr. Criscitello and many others—is environmental consciousness and buying less. Patagonia’s stores are closed on Black Friday and its ads often promote the idea of wearing clothes until they crumble. The company even sells used Patagonia gear traded in by customers under its “Worn Wear” program. This “anti-new” stance might seem odd but it has endeared a generation of vintage fleece hounds to the brand. (A Patagonia representative declined to comment.)<br />Not all fleeces fit the bill. Today’s nostalgic fleece-fanatics fall roughly into two camps: the texture specialists and the pattern nuts. Texture heads will tell you that newer, crisper jackets (which increasingly are fabricated using recycled materials) can’t hold a candle to their fluffy forebears. “I definitely prefer the older stuff,” said Colby Cook, 21, a student and part-time clothing reseller in Austin, Texas, who owns more than 30 “deep pile” fleeces, some of which date back to 1988. “Deep pile” refers to the jacket’s fuzzy shell, tenderly evocative of a Teddy Ruxpin. For collectors like Mr. Cook, who operates @DeepPilesForMiles, an Instagram account cataloging his collection, these luscious shells are the holy grail.<br />Both texture fans and pattern connoisseurs, who live for collectible motifs, believe that pre-2000 jackets almost always beat models from the past twenty years. What Virginia’s Mr. Criscitello finds so incredible about Patagonia fleeces from the ’90s—“and even the late-’80s”—is that the color-blocking and patterns are “just so original.” (A typical palette might be coral, cinnamon-brown and pumpkin, while motifs range from stylized gargoyles to vaguely Aztec plant forms). He’s so smitten that he created OldSchoolOutdoor.com, a crowd-sourced online database of zanily patterned pullover Patagonia Snap-Ts that date from 1985, when they made their debut, to fall 2000.</td>

It’s going to happen. The Browns currently sit at a sturdy 9-3, which means they’re a mathematical lock to finish the 16-game 2020 NFL season with more Ws than Ls. No recount, no machine error, put this one in the books. It’s a rarity: the Browns haven’t finished with a winning record in 13 seasons. It’s only happened twice before in this century.

I’ve seen plenty of craziness during this cockamamie year—so have you, I’m sure. How can any of us rule out another bizarre scenario, even this historically woebegone outfit playing meaningful football in February, or March, or late August, or whenever they wind up playing the Super Bowl?<br />(Yes, I know Patrick Mahomes exists, as do the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Browns probably will have to get through one of those behemoths to go anywhere. I’ll get to that in a second. Let’s give Cleveland a minute of love here.)</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler has decided to retain current standards for soot pollution, keeping fine-particle pollution limits adopted in 2012 that set the bar at 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air.<br />EPA staff scientists in a draft report last year said key studies could support imposing tougher standards of between 8 and 10 micrograms per cubic meter. The report cited estimates that limits within that range could cut mortality risks by more than 20%, potentially saving more than 12,000 lives a year.<br />EPA officials said they decided to keep current standards after review by a scientific advisory committee and considering public comments. U.S. particulate matter levels are 20% lower than in France, Germany and Great Britain, five times below the global average and six times below levels in China, officials said.<br />“The EPA under the Trump Administration has continued America’s leadership in clear air, lowering our particulate matter levels to well below those of many of our global competitors,” Mr. Wheeler said in a statement. “Maintaining these important standards will ensure Americans can continue to breathe some of the cleanest air on the planet.”<br />The Sierra Club environmental group criticized the decision, saying soot poses the biggest threat to minority and low-income neighborhoods that are often located near industrial plants.</td>

That is slightly less than what is needed to vaccinate all front-line medical professionals and long-term care residents—the groups that a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel has recommended should be first in line.<br />Federal estimates show there are about 24 million people in these high-priority groups—21 million health-care workers and three million residents of long-term care facilities.<br />That leaves hospitals with the task of deciding who among their high-priority employees should go first. Nebraska Medicine, the hospitals and clinics affiliated with the University of Nebraska Medical Center, will likely use a lottery. The Mayo Clinic is combing through data on occupational risks to decide who to put at the top of the list. Mass General Brigham in Boston is prioritizing the hospital units where workers have most exposure to those with Covid-19.<br />The CDC has said priority should go to health-care workers who come into direct contact with Covid-19 patients and patients’ families, and with infectious materials. Workers who have had Covid-19 could wait 90 days from infection before seeking vaccination, a period during which research suggests little risk of reinfection, the CDC said.</td>

Some congressional Democrats and activist groups are pushing him to go further, forgiving most or all of the $1.6 trillion in student debt.<br />Student debt is the largest type of debt held by Americans after mortgages. The amount has tripled since 2007. Defaults are high. Many economists say that canceling at least some debt would boost the U.S. economy by reducing borrowers’ bills, leaving them with more money to spend on homes and cars, or even starting businesses.<br />To move forward, the Biden administration has to choose how broad or targeted to make the debt reductions, risking helping groups seen as undeserving and widening political fault lines between those with college degrees and those without.<br />“Whether Democrat, Republicans or Independent, you understand there’s an issue here and it needs to be addressed,” said Wayne Johnson, a former Education Department official in the Trump administration who unsuccessfully ran for a Georgia Senate seat this year campaigning as a Republican on canceling student debt.</td>

Privacy from businesses that have an unprecedented volume of data that can be used to target or profile consumers.<br />But with so many people working from home, privacy has taken on an added dimension: the privacy of information from the ordinary, everyday intrusion by family or colleagues.<br />There is, for instance, the loss of privacy when your colleagues overhear you arguing with your children, or see what you read on the bookshelves behind you. Or the loss of privacy when your spouse can see what’s on your computer or how you handled your midafternoon Zoom call.<br />That’s exactly why so many of us need a work-from-home privacy strategy: a set of guidelines for what needs to stay private from whom, and a plan that makes it easy to stick to those guidelines.<br />It may be obvious to say this, but it bears saying anyway: Your employer and your clients are counting on you to keep their information private. That may not be a big deal when you’re in an office and bring work home some nights or on weekends. But it’s a much bigger issue when all your work and every conversation is available for anybody walking past you or your computer. Your spouse or your 10-year-old son may not feel quite as compelled to keep secrets as you do.</td>

      <td>NEW DELHI—The companies behind two of the most promising Covid-19 vaccine candidates,  AstraZeneca  PLC  and  Pfizer Inc.,  have asked India for emergency-use authorization to start using their vaccines in the South Asian nation, which has been one of the worst hit by the pandemic.<br />Both Pfizer and Serum Institute of India—which is manufacturing AstraZeneca’s vaccine for developing countries—have applied for the authorization, which would allow their vaccines to circumvent a long trial and application process, said an official at the Drugs Controller General of India.<br />“This will save countless lives, and I thank the Government of India and Sri @narendramodi ji for their invaluable support,” Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer and owner of SII, said in a tweet Monday.<br />If either gets authorization, it could be an important jump start for the global manufacturing process as India is one of the world’s biggest vaccine manufacturers. The emergency authorization would give its companies the ability and confidence to ramp up production.<br />Serum Institute already has more than 40 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine made and could have more than 100 million by the end of the year, said a company spokesman.</td>

International investors don’t seem to have particularly noticed.<br />The entire surge in international purchases of Japanese equities recorded from late 2012 to mid-2015, totaling around $240 billion, has melted away in the subsequent years. And foreigners have again sold more Japanese stocks than they bought this year.<br />That may sound like a surprise to readers who have noticed a distinct turn toward optimism from banks and asset managers looking ahead to 2021. And, indeed, there are many reasons to be optimistic.<br />The recovery story that most analysts and investors seem prepared for would be good news for Japanese stocks. Analysts at BCA Research note that almost 40% of the MSCI Japan is made up of industrial and consumer discretionary stocks, compared with more like 20% in the U.S. The index has a price-to-earnings ratio of a little over 18, compared with a little below 24 for the U.S., and is more cheaply valued even on a sector-by-sector basis.<br />The market is also notably cash rich, allowing for more shareholder-friendly dividend and buyback policies than companies in Europe and the U.S. may be able to manage. Both European and U.S. stocks have total debt to total equity ratios in excess of 110%, while Japan’s is below 90%. There are no magic numbers when it comes to corporate leverage, but servicing debt and dealing with any increase in spreads is now clearly a greater concern elsewhere in the developed world.</td>

      <td>SÃO PAULO—The election of Joe Biden as U.S. president will raise pressure on Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to step up the country’s effort to curb growing deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.<br />Deforestation in the Amazon has accelerated under the Brazilian leader—in part, environmentalists say, because his calls for economic development in the jungle have emboldened land grabbers, illegal ranchers and wildcat miners. The former army officer once nicknamed himself “Captain Chainsaw.”<br />Official data released last week showed deforestation at a 12-year high. About 4,300 square miles of forest, more than three quarters the size of Connecticut, were lost in the 12 months to July this year—up 9.5% from the same period a year earlier, according to satellite data from Brazil’s space agency, Inpe.<br />The rising deforestation has led to growing pressure at home and abroad on the Brazilian nationalist. France has cited deforestation as a reason for holding up passage of a large trade deal between the European Union and Mercosur, the South American bloc, of which Brazil is the biggest member.<br />British supermarkets have already threatened to boycott Brazil’s products, while apparel and footwear company  VF Corp. —owner of Timberland, Vans and the North Face—stopped using Brazilian leather last year in protest over destruction of the Amazon.</td>

      <td>Experts at top medical centers discuss quarantining, testing and informing people that you may be infected</td>
      <td>The desserts were delicious, the reunions were warm, but you’ve just learned that someone at the holiday gathering you attended had Covid-19. What next? Today’s shorter quarantine guidelines, a variety of tests and newly available therapies call for updated protocols. So what should you do if you feel sick or if you spent time near the fellow guest who has been diagnosed? And is it safer to get tested if you’re considering meeting with family within the next several weeks?<br />Here’s what infectious-disease experts at some of the country’s top medical centers advise.<br /><br />How can you assess your level of exposure?<br />Before taking steps to get tested, determine your level of exposure and whether you’ve had close contact. Seeing others outside—with everyone wearing masks—doesn’t warrant a test. If both people were unmasked and within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes, that qualifies as exposure and warrants a test. If you wore a mask and the other person didn’t and was at a greater distance, exposure is less likely and you may not need to get tested, according to Peter Katona, professor of medicine and public health at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. If you’re indoors and have had close contact, defined as being within 6 feet of someone for a total of 15 minutes over 24 hours, you’re a good candidate for getting tested. “If somebody is exchanging air with you, then you have a chance of getting infected,” says Dr. Katona.</td>

      <td>The downturn in the oil markets isn’t all bad news for pipeline operators</td>
      <td>Low oil prices aren’t exactly at the top of pipeline operators’ wish lists, but they do come with one possible upside: They could help boost the value of existing infrastructure.<br />Depressed oil demand has led energy companies across the value chain—from those pumping it, to those transporting, refining and converting it into other products—to hold back on new investments. Permitting challenges already were slowing down new pipelines. The pandemic’s shock to the oil market was like slamming on the brakes.<br />In the third quarter, capital expenditures in the oil-and-gas industry were less than half the lowest level recorded in the economic crisis in 2009, according to Dean Forman, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute. The decline in spending applies not only to companies pumping oil and gas but also those in the crucial business of transporting and refining hydrocarbons. In the midstream sector, capital expenditures were down almost 30% year over year in the third quarter, according to API data.<br />Just as investors are asking for more discipline from producers of oil and natural gas, they also are demanding moderation from pipeline operators. Project return thresholds are getting higher for these companies, and investors are asking them to give priority to debt repayment rather than new projects, according to Timm Schneider, head of Americas energy and utility equity research at Citi Research.<br />All of that adds more speed bumps to new pipeline additions. President Trump’s moves to expedite controversial projects came with the unintended consequence of fueling challenges to permits that stood on shakier legal ground. The incoming Biden administration is unlikely to make things easier.</td>

The move helps Mr. Dylan set up his musical legacy and cash in on his life’s work.<br />Over the past five years, owning and selling the rights to music has become more valuable, as revenue from music streaming has grown. Songwriter catalogs have been commanding sale prices that amount to 10 to 18 times their annual royalties, compared with eight to 13 times in earlier years, according to people involved in the deals. Fleetwood Mac’s Stevie Nicks last month closed a deal to sell a majority stake in her publishing catalog, valuing it at $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />“By bringing to UMG the vast and brilliant Dylan songwriting catalog, in an instant, we have forever transformed the legacy of this company,” said Universal Chief Executive Lucian Grainge in an email to employees Monday.

Except when the billionaire turns the tables.<br />Patrick Drahi, the Franco-Israeli controlling shareholder of the Altice cable empire, is trying to take his European company private at an opportunistic valuation. This should serve as a warning to investors in  Altice USA ,  Mr. Drahi’s U.S. company: There is little to stop the same thing happening to them.<br />Mr. Drahi launched his offer for the shares he doesn’t already own in  Altice Europe  in September. The price was €4.11—a 23.8% premium to the previous close, a press release noted. But the share price was as high as €6.74 in February. European telecom companies haven’t escaped the Covid-19 crisis, and Altice Europe stock fell farther than most because of its high leverage.<br />True, the deal’s earnings multiple is ahead of where Europe’s former state telecom monopolies are trading in a deeply depressed sector. More pertinently, though, it is well behind those of transactions done in recent years by Altice Europe’s closest peer:  Liberty Global ,  the European investment vehicle of U.S. cable entrepreneur John Malone, who helped inspire the Altice ventures.<br />Still, Mr. Drahi owns 77.58% of Altice Europe, giving him substantial sway with its management. Having persuaded them that €4.11 is a fair price, the question is whether he even needs to convince minority shareholders. The Netherlands, where the company is listed, has a famously flexible corporate-governance regime.</td>

The premium, which was introduced last year, is set to take effect in the 2020-2021 growing season.<br />The producers include representatives of the cocoa industries in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which sell around 61% of the world’s cocoa supply, according to data from the International Cocoa Organization. “In breach of faith, some chocolatiers and trade houses have adopted covert strategies to circumvent the farmer income improvement mechanism with the aim of collapsing it,” they said in a recent statement.<br />A spokeswoman for Mars said the company wasn’t trying to circumvent the cocoa premium. “Mars Wrigley categorically disagrees with any allegation that it has changed its cocoa-buying practices to avoid payment of the [living income differential],” she said.<br />A spokesman for Hershey said the company doesn’t comment on specific details of purchases, but Hershey sometimes bases its decisions “on hedging pricing fluctuations in the market and…ensuring sufficient supply to meet our needs well into the future, especially in times of uncertainty.”</td>

Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee.<br />“These regulations let megacorporations choose how they want to be taxed,” he said. “They could take the massive tax cut Republicans gave them, or they could take an even bigger tax cut the Treasury Department pulled out of thin air.”<br />If Democrats don’t take control of the Senate after Georgia’s runoff elections in January, regulatory changes present the clearest paths to one of President-elect Joe Biden’s campaign promises: higher taxes on U.S. companies’ foreign operations.<br />The Biden transition team declined to comment. It would likely take months for the new administration to hire Treasury Department officials, make a decision and follow the procedures needed to revise or repeal the regulation.</td>

Some of the smallest funds are emerging as some of the best performers, driving greater demand for these types of managers.<br />Funds with less than $1 billion in assets are benefiting from their more manageable portfolios. They can dart in and out of holdings to protect gains or minimize losses amid the market volatility that has characterized this year. They also get more bang for their buck—making investments that require less firepower to affect their overall performance.<br />Among little funds putting up big numbers: London-based Alanda Capital Management Ltd., which manages less than $500 million and gained about 53% through November. Founder Christian Vogel-Claussen said his fund’s competitive edge comes from having a concentrated portfolio built by data science and fundamental research. The portfolio, which includes technology and consumer holdings, typically comprises 15 bets that stocks will rise and the same number of wagers on stocks falling.<br />“We want to be the nimble speedboat,” Mr. Vogel-Claussen said.<br />That agility is in demand today. Some investors were too nervous between March and June to take chances on small funds they hadn’t done due diligence on. But as they acclimated to Zoom and as lockdowns lifted, they became more confident, according to Murano, a firm that connects institutional investors with fund managers. Requests for boutique managers rose 22% in the third quarter from a year earlier.</td>

      <td>Few would have pegged surging Chinese exports to the U.S. as a likely outcome for 2020 a year ago. But that looks likely to persist a while yet.</td>
      <td>Eighteen months ago, in the depths of the trade war with the U.S., few would have predicted that Chinese exports would be breaking records in 2020. But that is what has happened. And with wide-scale vaccine rollout in developed countries months away, that impressive strength has a way to run.<br />Chinese exports jumped 21.1% year over year in November—a rise that, excluding the annual Lunar New Year holiday period that  typically falls sometime from January to February, was the strongest performance since 2011. The trade surplus also notched a high in dollar terms, hitting $75.4 billion.<br />Driving that rise was a surge of exports to the U.S. Big consignments of new iPhones probably boosted the numbers. Overall Chinese mobile-phone shipments alone rose nearly $8 billion month over month. But there are also more fundamental forces at work.<br />China’s exports in early 2020 were boosted by surging global demand for personal protective gear and medical goods. But more recently, the most obvious driver has been electronic goods such as computers—thanks to strong demand for items related to staying home, as consumers in the U.S. and Europe spend less on services such as dining out.<br />U.S. factories wouldn’t be equipped, most likely, to handle a jump in demand for such goods in the best of times since electronics supply chains are concentrated in Asia. And now, with the coronavirus surging again nationwide, American factories may have even more trouble filling orders as workers get sick or stay home.</td>

Among other things, it cited problems with contract terms and internal controls, including unreasonable incentives for staff. It said some clients were allowed to invest despite being too young to buy the product, and the bank used exaggerated advertising and offered gifts to attract customers.</td>

      <td>With November exports up 21% from a year earlier and import growth slowing, surplus hit $75.42 billion</td>
      <td>China’s trade surplus widened to a record in November, as global demand for the country’s goods grew even more robust.<br />November exports were up 21% from a year earlier, the General Administration of Customs reported Monday, accelerating from October’s 11.4% and beating economists’ 12% forecast. Imports were up 4.5%, slowing slightly from October’s 4.7% and short of the 5.3% expected by economists. The resulting $75.42 billion trade surplus topped the record set in May, when a drop in imports was the major factor.<br />China’s exports have topped market expectations since the second quarter, when Beijing moved to restart the world’s second-largest economy after lockdowns and Covid-19 outbreaks at the start of the year. During the pandemic, protective gear and work-from-home tech products have served as pillars for China’s overseas trade, helping it gain global market share.<br />“Outbound shipments remained strong thanks to a surge in global demand for Chinese-made consumer goods such as electronic products. Exports of other goods were still much more subdued,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist with Capital Economics.<br />China’s November shipments to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the U.S., its No. 1 and No. 3 trading partners, respectively, were up 10% and 46% from a year earlier, beating October’s pace. Exports to the European Union, its No. 2 trading partner, were up 8.6% after being down 7% in October, according to calculations made by The Wall Street Journal.</td>

      <td>Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R., Ga.) repeatedly dodged questions about whether she believes the Nov. 3 election in Georgia was rigged or if she supports President Trump’s attacks on her political patron, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, in a Sunday debate for one of two pivotal Senate runoff races.<br />During a debate period when the candidates could address each other, Ms. Loeffler’s Democratic opponent, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, asked for a yes or no reply to the question: Did Mr. Trump lose the election?<br />“You know, President Trump has every right to use every legal recourse available,” Ms. Loeffler replied, repeating her response to moderators who had already asked similar questions. “In our own state, we’ve seen time and again that we have investigations that need to be completed...We need to hold folks accountable involved in these investigations to make sure that they move more quickly because everything is at stake on Jan. 5 for the future of our country.”<br />Officials with the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office have said they have about 250 open investigations concerning potential wrongdoing in the 2020 elections but that state investigators haven't found widespread fraud that would overturn the results of the presidential race. President-elect Joe Biden was certified last month by Secretary of State undefinedBrad Raffensperger, a Republican, and Mr. Kemp as the winner of the state’s 16 electoral votes.<br />Mr. Warnock, senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, also ducked a key question during the debate. He was asked whether he supported adding justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, as some Democratic progressives have advocated, to dilute the influence of Mr. Trump’s conservative appointees.</td>

      <td>Exxon Mobil Corp.  is facing the threat of a proxy fight from a newcomer activist investor with a sustainability bent that wants the beleaguered energy giant to act faster to remake itself.<br />Engine No. 1 LLC, an investment firm launched by Chris James last week, is preparing to send a letter to  Exxon ’s  board urging the Irving, Texas-based company to focus more on investments in clean energy while cutting costs elsewhere to preserve its dividend. The letter, a copy of which was viewed by The Wall Street Journal, identifies four people the firm plans to nominate to Exxon’s 10-person board.<br />The San Francisco firm has the support of California State Teachers’ Retirement System, the big pension investor, and expects other shareholders to be sympathetic to the cause, given widespread frustration over Exxon’s share performance, a person familiar with the matter said. Calstrs holds a more than $300 million Exxon stake, while Engine No. 1 has one worth around $40 million, this person said.<br />Their combined ownership is smaller than what is typical for an activist taking on a company of Exxon’s size, and it is possible the campaign will fall flat. Still, Calstrs holds sway as the country’s second-largest pension fund and there have been instances of well-timed campaigns led by small shareholders gaining traction with other investors and yielding results.<br />“Without having seen the letter, we will decline to comment,” said Casey Norton, an Exxon spokesman.</td>

The position doesn’t require Senate confirmation.<br />Dr. Walensky faces a challenging assignment: leading the agency back to the front-line role it traditionally plays in fighting epidemics, and battling a surge in the pandemic that has sent the number of hospitalizations and deaths soaring.<br />For months, the White House played a hands-on role in shaping the federal government’s public health recommendations, sometimes heavily editing or overruling guidance from the CDC on matters such as social distancing in bars, restaurants and houses of worship. The agency has also suffered from its own mistakes, including errors that led to a delay in the rollout of a critical coronavirus diagnostic test that could have caught infections earlier in the pandemic.</td>

The new range would give the home-rental company a valuation of as much as $42 billion on a fully diluted basis and including proceeds from the offering.<br />DoorDash Inc., the food-delivery company that is expected to debut Wednesday, the day before Airbnb, plans to price its shares at the high end of or above its range of $90 to $95 a share—already raised from between $75 and $85, people familiar with the offering said. That would give the San Francisco company, the largest among its peers, a valuation of as much as $36 billion or more, on a fully diluted basis and including proceeds from the offering.<br />Taken together, the developments are the latest sign that the market for new issues, already at a record in terms of money raised in the U.S., is set for a climactic ending to the year. The market has been buoyed by soaring stocks, including those that have recently made their own debuts.<br />So far this year, more than $140 billion has been raised in initial public offerings on U.S. exchanges, far exceeding the previous full-year record high set at the height of the dot-com boom in 1999, according to Dealogic data that dates back to 1995.</td>

      <td>Workers find extra stress at what was once a lunchtime sanctuary for friendly chatter with colleagues; here’s how to take a breather safely on the job during the pandemic</td>
      <td>Lunch breaks have become a drag for Jason Alfonso.<br />Due to the pandemic, the steel mill where he works in Pittsburg, Calif., has reduced the capacity of break rooms from six to two people, mandated wearing masks at all times and encouraged employees to spray down tables with a bleach mixture after they eat. Not the most relaxed place to take a break after spending hours in an indoor warehouse.<br />“Usually there’s only one person in there at a time. If there is someone else, we don’t sit together, definitely 6 feet apart. To me it’s the same as eating by myself,” he says. Mr. Alfonso, who has lost two family members to Covid-19, understands why the precautions are necessary.<br />At workplaces across the country, break rooms have been linked to the spread of Covid-19. They’re often small, indoor spaces where people let their guard down to socialize. Even those most careful about masks must remove them to scarf down lunch. That leaves workers vulnerable to a disease that’s primarily spread through close, person-to-person contact.<br />At the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., over 900 staff members were infected with the coronavirus in November, says Laura Breeher, an occupational medicine specialist there who helps track the spread of the coronavirus among its staff and patients. Once Mayo’s contact tracers started looking into the high number of infections, they found work-related exposures mostly happening in break rooms and lunchrooms. (Community spread outside the hospital also played a role.)</td>

      <td>As the holiday season gets under way amid a Covid-19 surge across the country, employers are taking measures to encourage employees to limit their potential virus exposure and to safeguard workplaces. What is your boss is entitled to know about your holiday plans?<br />Employers have wide latitude during a pandemic in what they can ask regarding your holiday plans. That includes asking workers to take a pledge to refrain from any risky behavior—as some companies did right before Thanksgiving—and cautioning employees against any conduct that would violate federal or local health guidelines. It varies by state, but if it is a matter of protecting the safety of the workplace, employers can also discipline workers for what they do during off hours. That could include if workers don’t disclose potential exposure to the virus and return to the workplace without quarantining after personal travel or after attending large celebrations.<br />Limitations on what employers can restrict in your off-time vary by state, but companies generally have leeway when it comes to protecting workplace safety.<br />Employers are required under Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules to provide a safe workplace, says Jennifer Merrigan Fay, an employment-law partner in Boston at Goodwin Procter LLP. While companies can’t unreasonably invade an employee’s privacy and make requests such as not to go outside, they can take other unusual, but not illegal, steps during a health crisis aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19.<br />Companies can, for example, require employees to disclose any travel plans or recent trips, and can enforce recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or local health mandates for post-travel quarantine periods. Some firms also ask or require employees to sign pledges stating they’ll keep celebrations small, wear a mask or even limit contact with people outside of their household, she said.</td>

But lawmakers are still ironing out disputes over both the sprawling spending bill and a coronavirus relief package that they hope to attach to it.<br />On Sunday, a House Democratic leadership aide said that lawmakers would likely vote this week on a one-week continuing resolution, or short-term spending bill. Leaders want to combine a coronavirus aid package with the full-year spending bill, both of which require some more time.<br />Senior lawmakers on the appropriations committee had been signaling last week that the full-year spending bill needed more work and likely wouldn’t be ready by the Dec. 11 deadline. Republicans and Democrats have been hashing out differences over funding for construction of the wall along the border with Mexico, detention beds for immigrants and environmental provisions, among other matters.<br />House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said last week that they hoped to attach coronavirus relief to the full-year spending package, a compendium of the 12 bills needed to fund the government known as an omnibus.</td>

      <td>Ruling party politicians are expected to take most of the 277 seats in the National Assembly</td>
      <td>Venezuela’s authoritarian regime staged congressional elections Sunday that were expected to give President Nicolás Maduro complete control of all levers of power in a vote the country’s opposition and its supporters, including the U.S., rejected as fraudulent.<br />Until now Venezuela’s single-chamber congress, the National Assembly, had been the only government body under opposition leadership. But with Mr. Maduro’s regime having handed control of opposition parties to allies and exiled or jailed prominent adversaries, most opposition leaders called on their countrymen to boycott the vote in protest even if it meant the regime would dominate all of government and the armed forces.<br />The outcome has never really been in doubt in a country whose government is closely allied to Communist Cuba, Vladimir Putin’s Russia and Iran. Except for a few breakaway candidates not allied with Mr. Maduro, ruling party politicians are expected to take the vast majority of the 277 seats in the National Assembly.<br />“Venezuela’s electoral fraud has already been committed,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday afternoon on his official  Twitter  account. “The results announced by the illegitimate Maduro regime will not reflect the will of the Venezuelan people. What’s happening today is a fraud and a sham, not an election.”<br />As in recent elections in Venezuela, there were no traditional international monitors, and the members of the electoral council had been chosen without the participation of Mr. Maduro’s opponents. Venezuelans have also expressed distrust in the voting system, which in 2017 was rocked by allegations of fraud after the London-based company that provided electronic machines, Smartmatic, said the regime had doctored a million of the 8.1 million votes cast in an election.</td>

      <td>China has boasted the world’s second-largest arms-manufacturing industry for the past five years, ranking behind the U.S. in sales but outstripping Russia and the top European nations, according to a report released Sunday by a Swedish think tank.<br />In its annual study of arms sales, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) for the first time released figures for individual Chinese defense firms.<br />The study found that sales of arms and military services by the global sector’s 25 largest companies for which data are available totaled $361 billion last year, an 8.5% increase over 2018. SIPRI is an independent arms-trade analyst.<br />Among those companies, four are Chinese and 12 are American. Those Chinese companies had combined sales of $56.7 billion in 2019, compared with $221.2 billion from the U.S. companies. Two of the top 25 firms are Russian, with combined sales of $13.9 billion.<br />SIPRI figures showed that revenues for Chinese defense manufacturers have failed to keep pace with the global growth, with the top four Chinese firms growing by 4.8% last year. However, SIPRI’s data on Chinese firms excludes inaccessible sales figures from major companies in missile manufacturing and shipbuilding.</td>

      <td>The former defense minister is released in another loss for the drug war.</td>
      <td>At a West Point ceremony in November 2018, the U.S. Defense Department conferred the Legion of Merit on Mexico’s then-secretary of national defense, Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos. Less than two years later, on Oct. 15, the retired Mexican four-star was arrested in Los Angeles on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges.<br />A grand jury in the Eastern District of New York had handed up an indictment of Gen. Cienfuegos on Aug. 14, 2019, for crimes allegedly committed between December 2015 and February 2017. The indictment remained sealed until his arrest.<br />On Oct. 16, requesting a “permanent order of detention,” Acting U.S. Attorney Seth D. DuCharme alleged before the New York court that “while holding public office in Mexico, the defendant used his official position to assist the H-2 Cartel, a notorious Mexican drug cartel, in exchange for bribes.”<br />U.S. prosecutors insist they had what they needed to convict Gen. Cienfuegos, who was an active member of the Mexican military during the six years (2012-18) he held the cabinet-level post in the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto. But on Nov. 17, Attorney General William Barr dropped the case. The general was released and on Nov. 18 returned to Mexico, where the government has said it will investigate the charges. The odds of that happening are pretty long.<br />Chalk up one more loss for the futile, half-century-old U.S. war on drugs. In this case, the circular logic out of Washington is that keeping Mexico as a U.S. partner in fighting transnational crime trumps actual crime fighting. The good news for the drug-war bureaucracy is that its jobs program is secure.</td>

      <td>Misguided opposition in the Senate bodes ill for U.S. Mideast policy in the Biden administration.</td>
      <td>Senate opposition to the proposed U.S. arms sales to the United Arab Emirates reflects a dangerous reversion to the Obama-era understanding of the Middle East. While opponents of the deal claim that the Emirates have misused other U.S. weapons in Yemen, the real issue is much broader.<br />A Senate vote on legislation to halt the $23 billion arms deal is expected in days. While opposition will likely fail—even if the bill passes, supermajorities would be needed to override the expected presidential veto—the thinking behind it foreshadows an ill-advised Biden administration policy toward Iran.<br />The Iranian threat to regional peace and security has altered the strategic reality of the Middle East since the misbegotten 2015 nuclear deal. Arab states increasingly fear Tehran’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, but also its support for terrorism in Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, as well as its conventional military activities. The decision by Bahrain and the U.A.E. to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel shows how Iran’s increased—and largely unchallenged—belligerence has realigned the Middle East’s correlation of forces.<br />Many of these shifts stem from the nuclear deal, which released between $120 billion and $150 billion in frozen assets and freed Iran from arduous economic sanctions, providing Tehran the resources to expand its military and clandestine capabilities. Iran’s Quds Force used its share of the windfall to beef up support for Iraqi Shiite militias, Syria’s Assad, and Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria. In response, the Emirates and other U.S. friends rightly want more-advanced arms.<br />Less reported, but of vital importance to the Gulf Cooperation Council’s six Arab member states, was Iran’s dramatic expansion of support for Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Previous Iranian aid to the Houthis had been intended to stalemate Saudi and Emirati efforts to install a stable, pro-GCC government in San’a, but in 2017 Tehran ramped up shipments of sophisticated weaponry that could strike far beyond Yemen’s borders. This threatened Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure; important civilian airports in Riyadh, Dubai and Abu Dhabi; and commercial shipping in the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, critical sea lanes to the Suez Canal.</td>

      <td>The best option may be to inoculate those over 65 with a focus on low-income communities.</td>
      <td>A remarkable achievement is at hand: the introduction of two vaccines that have been shown in trials to be highly effective at preventing symptomatic Covid disease. These vaccines will arrive less than a year after the initial sequencing of the virus. For several months the demand will outstrip the supply. Doses will have to be rationed. What’s the most equitable way to allocate this scarce resource?<br />Once the vaccine is approved, manufacturing will ramp up quickly and distribution will start. By spring there may be enough supply to vaccinate about 50 million people a month. But initially, there won’t be enough doses to vaccinate everyone at risk of Covid complications. I am on the board of  Pfizer ,  which developed one of these vaccines. Policy makers, ethicists and clinicians will have to come up with a plan for whom to vaccinate first.<br />Decisions on allocating vaccines are up to the states, but their plans must be approved by the federal government. The vaccine supply will be divvied up based on state population size. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will issue guidelines outlining priority populations and the order in which to vaccinate them. The CDC’s guidelines aren’t binding but will heavily influence state decision-making.<br />Goals include preserving human life, reducing the size and scope of the epidemic, and mitigating health disparities, especially among low-income Americans. Blacks, Hispanics and indigenous communities are bearing a disproportionate share of the disease and death.<br />Many of those hardest hit are essential workers who continued working through the pandemic. They couldn’t go without paychecks. They couldn’t work from home. As a result, they have died from Covid in higher numbers.</td>

      <td>Congress has made clear that Nazi expropriation victims can bring lawsuits.</td>
      <td>On Monday’s anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases that provide an opportunity to protect America’s enduring role in securing justice for the victims of the Axis powers.<br />The cases arise out of Nazi Germany’s well-documented campaign to seize art and other property. Federal Republic of Germany v. Philipp was brought by heirs of Frankfurt-based Jewish art dealers who were coerced by Hermann Goering into “selling” a collection of medieval Christian devotional objects—called the Guelph Treasure, or Welfenschatz—to the state of Prussia in 1935. Goering gave the trove to Hitler as a gift. Republic of Hungary v. Simon was brought by 14 Holocaust survivors seeking compensation for the seizure of their property as they boarded cattle cars to Auschwitz.<br />At issue is whether U.S. courts should evaluate these claims for expropriation on the merits, as Congress has directed, or whether—as Germany and Hungary urge—courts are free to refrain from doing so out of “international comity.”<br />The answer is clear. As the justices explained in Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria (1983), Congress has the “undisputed” prerogative and power “to decide, as a matter of federal law, whether and under what circumstances foreign nations should be amenable to suit in the United States.” In 1976 Congress passed the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which commands that “a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States” when, among other things, claims involve “rights in property taken in violation of international law.” In the Holocaust Victims Redress Act of 1998, Congress expressly found that “the Nazis’ policy of looting art was a critical element and incentive in their campaign of genocide”—a clear international-law violation.<br />Congress has passed numerous laws specifically to facilitate redress for Holocaust victims, including the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016, which extended the statute of limitations for such claims. Congress unambiguously intended for Holocaust victims and their heirs to be able to bring these claims against foreign sovereigns in U.S. courts.</td>

      <td>To stay on top, says a progressive writer, the U.S. must triple its population. Maybe so. But does he mean it?</td>
      <td>Six years ago Matthew Yglesias co-founded the news and policy website Vox. That venture, begun when Obama-era progressivism appeared to have vanquished all before it, was designed not to argue for liberal policies but patiently to “explain” them to a young and receptive online audience. In November Mr. Yglesias announced—because in the era of social media you announce these things—that he was leaving Vox and starting his own venture on Substack, a subscription-based online platform.<br />I am not typically in sympathy with Mr. Yglesias’s views, but he is a lucid writer and enough of a contrarian for even a conservative like me to appreciate and learn from. He is, moreover, one of several journalists on the left recently to leave their employers for reasons of unwanted editorial control. His most recent book, “One Billion Americans: The Case for Thinking Bigger,” contends that the only way the United States can remain economically and culturally “number one”—his term—is to triple the country’s population to a billion.<br />Left-leaning writers ordinarily take a skeptical view of population increases—more people means more environmental degradation—whereas pro-natal policies are typically associated with the right. It’s noteworthy, whatever else can be said about his book, that so committed a progressive as Mr. Yglesias should take the view that America needs more babies.<br />And he’s right. It does. A declining birth rate makes robust economic growth harder to achieve, further strains the government’s ability to pay for social welfare programs and diminishes society’s capacity to flourish in the long term. Progressives, however, tend to worry more that social-welfare programs aren’t generous enough than that there isn’t enough revenue to pay for them. They are also wedded to an understanding of human relations that devalues procreation and the family as an institution at every turn. In this worldview, it’s not unfair to say, marriage is the formalization of emotional attachment, easily rescinded; access to inexpensive birth control is a fundamental human right; and abortion—the literal curtailment of the human population—is the sine qua non of a free society. This outlook has prevailed in Western countries for a long time. It may be good or bad, depending on your point of view, but it is not calculated to yield high birth rates.<br />Mr. Yglesias is not prepared to offer even the mildest regrets for the fruits, or the lack of fruits, of his left-liberal orthodoxy. He is a policy maven and so he believes that a raft of federal and state policies, presumably implemented by smart people like himself, can reverse what it took the sexual revolution half a century to accomplish. Establish universal day care and pre-K education, mandate parental leave, keep schools open year round, and young couples will feel sufficiently at ease to start having lots of babies again.</td>

      <td>The Supreme Court extends in scrutiny of orders limiting the free exercise of religion to California and Kentucky.</td>
      <td>The media are still preoccupied with Donald Trump, but there is other news, some of it even good. One example is the Supreme Court’s new attention to violations of religious rights in the pandemic.<br />Late last week the Court vacated a ruling by a district court that upheld California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s sweeping restrictions on religious gatherings. The unsigned order remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court’s November ruling that enjoined similar restrictions in New York (Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo).<br />Mr. Newsom banned indoor worship services, small and large, for almost all Californians. But even as he strictly limited church attendance, he let liquor stores and cardrooms operate without capping the number of people allowed. This disparate treatment is what the Court scored in New York, and its intervention in California shows its growing impatience with limits on constitutional rights as the pandemic continues.<br />A separate case out of Kentucky gives the Court another chance to protect the free exercise of religion. In an executive order last month, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear shut down in-person instruction and private and public K-12 schools. That included Danville Christian Academy, which sued along with Kentucky’s Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron.<br />Gov. Beshear says there’s no problem because schools are subject to the same shutdown rules whether they are public or private, secular or religious. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his edicts on Nov. 29, citing the 1990 Employment Division v. Smith, when the Supreme Court held that a neutral and generally applicable law can stand even if it incidentally burdens religious practice.</td>

      <td>Government labor lawyers have clearly never run a business.</td>
      <td>Both parties in Washington are targeting tech firms, albeit for different political reasons. Last week the Trump Justice Department took its latest turn with a dubious civil-rights lawsuit against  Facebook .<br />Justice says Facebook’s hiring and recruitment practices discriminate against American citizens in favor of foreign H-1B visa holders seeking green cards. But if Facebook is guilty, the list of business culprits is going to be very long. “Facebook refused to recruit, consider, or hire qualified and available U.S. workers for over 2,600 positions that Facebook, instead, reserved for temporary visa holders it sponsored for permanent work authorization (or “green cards”) in connection with the permanent labor certification process (PERM),” Justice claims.<br />U.S. immigration law allows employers to offer permanent positions to high-skilled H-1B visa holders after six years by sponsoring them for green cards. However, Labor Department regulations require employers to show that they advertised the job to Americans and that there were no minimally qualified U.S. applicants.<br />“Qualified” is in the eye of the employer. According to DOJ, all applicants with the same amount of work experience and degree are equally qualified. Government attorneys have clearly never run a business. The DOJ complaint concedes that Facebook followed Labor’s regulations. Instead, it alleges that Facebook didn’t advertise positions belonging to foreign workers whom they wanted to sponsor for green cards as widely as it did some other job openings. As a result, few Americans applied for the foreign-workers’ positions.<br />Yet Justice produces no evidence that Facebook discriminated against American citizens. Facebook vigorously recruited U.S. workers for thousands of open positions. Facebook merely sought to retain foreigners who had been employed at the company for many years instead of taking a flyer on newcomers. What’s wrong with that?</td>

      <td>The outcome of the presidential race isn’t the only election result being contested in Arizona, and the other has even greater consequences for the law. Last week two lawsuits were filed against Proposition 208, the ballot initiative that imposes a new 3.5% tax surcharge to raise an estimated $827 million for education. It passed with 51.7% of the vote.<br />The suits are challenging whether Prop 208, which passed as a statute, must conform to the state constitution. One suit was filed by businesswoman Ann Siner and retired judge John Buttrick, the other by the Goldwater Institute, the influential Arizona think tank.<br />The suits claim that Prop 208 contradicts a constitutional amendment that limits the amount of revenue provided to school districts each year. It also overrides another constitutional provision requiring a two-thirds majority of the Legislature to approve a tax increase.<br />The Legislative Council, a nonpartisan legislative office that reviews bills and ballot measures for form and constitutionality, held that Prop 208’s language exempting the money it raises from an existing cap on education spending “is likely invalid” because it violates express constitutional limits. Supporters went ahead anyway. The state Supreme Court declined to rule on claims that Prop 208 unconstitutionally curtails the Legislature’s authority but said it couldn’t consider the issue until it passed.<br />Prop 208 supporters say the people are sovereign and have spoken through the initiative. But the suits argue that, though the people are sovereign, they still have to obey their own laws and constitution.</td>

      <td>When the White House announced in October that Sudan planned to normalize relations with Israel, it showed that the peace movement could extend beyond the Persian Gulf. The northeast African country is changing for the better, but a pair of self-interested Senators could derail this progress.<br />Sudan had been a geopolitical nightmare for most of dictator Omar al-Bashir’s 30 years in power. He fell last year, and Abdalla Hamdok, an economist and reformer, became Prime Minister. A quarter-century after the country hosted Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, the transitional government is opening up civil society and promising democratic elections in 2022.<br />Washington and Khartoum have negotiated a broad deal to improve ties. On top of the agreement with Jerusalem, Sudan has put $335 million in an escrow account to pay victims of al Qaeda’s 1998 U.S. embassy bombings. In exchange the U.S. would lift its state sponsor of terrorism designation and restore Sudan’s sovereign immunity. The deal would open the country to foreign investment, which its shrinking economy desperately needs. But Congress needs to approve.<br />Mr. Hamdok leads a fragile government and has survived an assassination attempt. Many Islamists are unhappy with his turn to the West, and some problematic officials from the Bashir era remain influential. It could be tough for the reformer to keep pushing change—or even remain in office—if the agreement falls through and his legitimacy becomes questionable. Israeli-Sudanese normalization would be off the table, and Sudan’s currently poor ties with Iran would likely warm up.<br />This seems like an easy U.S. call, and the deal has overwhelming support on Capitol Hill. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) blocked a bipartisan legal-peace bill in September on grounds that 9/11 victims would no longer be able to pursue claims against Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism. Yet the compromise bill would have let victims use the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (Jasta) to pursue Sudan alongside Saudi Arabia. Some of the 9/11 victims’ lawyers found this compromise acceptable.</td>

      <td>When New York University moved many classes online amid the pandemic, a group of third-year film and drama students at the school took things into their own hands. Reluctant to tackle a semester of what they labeled “Zoom Shakespeare” and “Zoom Treasure Island,” they began researching where to live and work together inexpensively. “We wanted to create an environment where we [could] riff off each other,” said Marina Fess, an acting major.<br />The students organized a creative collective in Vermont without oversight or advice from professors or NYU, which isn’t awarding academic credit for the three-month stint.<br />Many students elsewhere also took action, choosing either to postpone college or interrupt their studies to work as proofreaders, long-distance tutors, campaign volunteers, researchers and DoorDash delivery people. Some are pursuing passions like drone piloting.<br />During Covid, the decision to take a gap year or semester before or during college is complicated. With many school policies in flux, tuition refunds or credits aren’t always a given and students who have secured scholarships may be hesitant to defer. At some schools, students who take time off may risk losing the chance to enroll whenever they like, and could have to resubmit financial aid applications the following academic year. Finding gap-year activities also is harder now. Even part-time jobs can be tough to land and the pandemic has suspended or limited many traditional pursuits, like travel or international volunteer programs.<br />Jill Tipograph, co-founder of Early Stage Careers, a career coaching service for college students and young professionals, says both high-school seniors who postpone college and mid-college students putting their education on pause should commit to activities that develop their skills and maturity. She suggests that they map out their gap period and how to structure their days. “You need to have a plan,” Ms. Tipograph says. “You can’t just take time off.”</td>

      <td>President had asked Georgia governor to call a special legislative session and push lawmakers to appoint pro-Trump electors</td>
      <td>Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp won’t call a special session of the state’s legislature, rebuffing a request from President Trump, Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan said Sunday.<br />Mr. Trump asked Mr. Kemp in a phone conversation Saturday to call a special session of the state legislature and to push lawmakers to appoint pro-Trump electors who would swing the Electoral College in his favor. Mr. Trump repeated the request at a rally Saturday night in Georgia, which Mr. Kemp didn’t attend.<br />The initial count and a recount in Georgia found that Democrat Joe Biden won the state by about 12,000 votes, and Georgia’s secretary of state is expected to certify on Monday that a second recount confirmed Mr. Biden’s victory. There is no evidence of widespread election fraud in Georgia or other states.<br />“The governor is not going to call us into a special session,” Mr. Duncan, a Republican, said on CNN. “We’re certainly not going to move the goal posts at this point in the election. We are going to continue to follow the letter of the law.”<br />A second Republican elected official, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, said on ABC, “I don’t believe that there’s the will in the general assembly for a special session.’’</td>

      <td>Buying a stock that has just split generally pays off. But in some years it’s a losing move.</td>
      <td>In the past few months, numerous well-known companies have undergone stock splits, including  Apple  and  Tesla .<br />In theory, a stock split shouldn’t matter one bit for a company’s future returns. Cutting the price per share of a company in half while doubling the number of shares outstanding changes nothing fundamental about the company, since its market capitalization is exactly the same as it was before.<br />But examining the full list of stock splits over the past 40 years highlights some interesting results. Overall, the stocks of companies that split their shares have significantly outperformed their benchmark over the subsequent months, earning an average of 1 percentage point more than the benchmark over the six months after the split.<br />Yet, there is one period when buying into a stock after it has split appears to go horribly wrong—when exuberance among individual investors is high. In years when equity markets were on a tear, buying into a stock split cost an investor an average of more than 6 percentage points in lost returns, compared with the stock’s benchmark, one year after the split.<br />To undertake this study, Stephanie Fincher and Eric Dzik (research assistants at George Mason University) and I examined a total 3,480 stock splits and reverse stock splits since 1980 for U.S. stocks listed on the Nasdaq or NYSE. We looked at the one-month, six-month and 12-month returns for investors who bought stocks that had just split or been part of a reverse split.</td>

      <td>Democrats devise magic ‘multipliers’ to justify spending, but the returns never show.</td>
      <td>Wait for it . . . any day now . . . get ready for the “multipliers.” You know, the idea that a government dollar spent magically turns into multiple dollars in the economy. We ought to start hearing that silly word again as the lame-duck coronavirus stimulus negotiations kick in. Expect more multiplier mumbo jumbo as the Biden administration begins its tax-and-spend fiesta.<br />Let’s face it, the Democrats haven’t had a believable economic messenger since Robert Rubin during the Clinton administration. Since then they’ve presented a cast of characters—Larry Summers, Mr. Biden’s adviser Jared Bernstein, and lately Elizabeth Warren—who bend themselves into pretzels to justify higher spending and then higher taxes.<br />The  New York Times  described this trend during the early days of the Obama administration. The financial crisis team of Jason Furman, Tim Geithner and Mr. Summers were “carrying around this list of multipliers” taken from a chart by Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. Every dollar spent extending unemployment insurance benefits would, the fairy tale went, boost the economy by $1.64. Sadly, a dollar in reduced corporate taxes would boost the economy by only 30 cents. But cheer up, every dollar spent on food stamps would spur a $1.73 increase in gross domestic product. Mr. Zandi called it “bang for the buck”—the proverbial free lunch. It’s more like “dud for the dollar” because it didn’t work. It never does. Multipliers are a canard, a Keynesian conceit.<br />The economy grew after the Great Recession, as it does after every recession. The stimulus didn’t stimulate. Shovel-ready projects weren’t ready. Many complained that the stimulus wasn’t big enough. More hooey. The Obama administration’s high taxes and heaps of regulation held the economy back. Is spending driving today’s recovery? Think back to the Heroes Act 2.0, Nancy Pelosi’s $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Economic growth in the third quarter of 2020 was 33% as lockdowns were lifted, despite—or because of—that gigantic stimulus package not becoming law.<br />The theory of multipliers is based on the Keynesian view that poorer consumers tend to spend a large amount of increased income, and the rich less so. But multipliers are half a story. Someone has to put up the original money that allegedly gets multiplied, taking it away from the private sector and negating whatever dwindling chain of transactions are hypothesized. It’s like two waves canceling each other out—you can’t just do the math on the additive public wave and ignore subtracting the private. This demand-side theory omits the principle of productivity, the real driver of economic growth and prosperity.</td>

Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), who had called for the investigation after the one-time photo giant landed a potential $765 million government loan in July.<br />In his response, the DFC’s inspector general, Anthony Zakel, said he found no evidence that employees of the agency had any conflicts of interest in the plans, nor did he find “any evidence of misconduct on the part of DFC officials.”<br />The review follows a high-profile period for the DFC, which President Trump empowered to support the Covid-19 response under the Defense Production Act. Revamped during the Trump administration, the agency usually focuses on funding projects in the developing world and is run by Adam Boehler, a health-care professional who was formerly a roommate of the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.<br />The Kodak plan came together quickly—in “Trump time,” as White House adviser Peter Navarro, who spearheaded the deal, has said.</td>

They accused Mr. Schumer and his colleagues of being soft. Signs urged him to “show some spine” and to resist “by any means necessary.”<br />Nearly every Democratic senator eventually complied. Oregon’s Sen. Jeff Merkley vowed to obstruct the president’s nominees purely as “a protest” against Republicans. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut promised to “shatter precedent” to stymie nominations.<br />The result was unprecedented. As had been tradition, Presidents Clinton and Obama had nearly all of their cabinet confirmed in January. Mr. Clinton had 13 out of 14; Mr. Obama, 11 out of 15. Senate Democrats made sure Mr. Trump had only three.<br />Because the Democrats abolished the filibuster for confirmation votes in 2013, they couldn’t ultimately block any appointment without Republican support. But nominees faced a bombardment of endless “questions for the record.” Democrats voted en bloc against nominees in committee. They consistently refused to consent to routine floor votes, forcing the use of the cloture procedure, then made sure to use every minute of the 30 hours of postcloture debate to delay the confirmation vote as long as they could.</td>

Governments, including the former Soviet Union and the U.S., have tested using directed energy as a potential weapon or a tool for espionage or crowd control in the past.</td>

California data provide an example. Between 2008 and 2018 the volume of hospital care purchased by commercial insurers declined by 15% while their payments (and prices) to hospitals increased by 283%. Much of this increase is due to the growing power of large systems. In many markets across the U.S., insurance companies have no choice but to contract with dominant health systems—at above-market rates—to offer health plans that meet network adequacy requirements demanded by regulators and employers.<br />We need limited but targeted regulations to restore competition to provider markets if the GOP model of limited government control can work. Otherwise the public, which doesn’t currently support a government-run system, will see no other option.<br />Prof. Glenn Melnick<br />University of Southern California</td>

Saudi Arabia has denied the meeting took place, but Israel hasn’t. The Wall Street Journal reported that Prince Mohammed pulled back from a deal during the encounter, largely because of the U.S. election result.<br />In a fiery address at the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal condemned Israel as the last Western colonizer of the Middle East. He disparaged its claims of upholding human rights and enumerated decades of crimes committed against the Palestinians.<br />“They’re demolishing homes as they wish and they assassinate whomever they want, and yet the Israeli Knesset passed a law that defines the citizenship of Israel as exclusively Jewish, denying the non-Jewish inhabitants of Israel of equal rights under the law,” Prince Turki said. “What kind of democracy is that?”<br />He prefaced his remarks by saying they represented his personal view, but as a senior prince who advises the Saudi king, his comments are closely monitored as a policy bellwether. Following criticism of Palestinian leaders by another senior Saudi royal in October, Prince Turki’s comments reveal the divergent views at the top echelons of the secretive kingdom toward warming relations with Israel.</td>

Will Trump Deliver?” (op-ed, Nov. 27): Prof. Blinder chants the left’s mantra that the economic recovery is in peril unless President Trump and Senate Republicans can work with House Democrats to pass another stimulus package. It’s hard to believe, however, that the economy could survive and thrive during the state lockdowns preferred by Democrats in the last eight months, but it cannot scrape by for eight weeks until Bidenomics arrives and the spending floodgates reopen.<br />If times are so tough in several blue or purple states, why did Democrats in the House reject the GOP offer in October of a $1.8 trillion stimulus package? The governments that allegedly were in decent fiscal health before the pandemic were, in fact, living on the edge after decades of imprudent underfunding of pension and health benefits for government workers.<br />Some type of federal bailout of beleaguered state and local governments surely is on the horizon. It is a rare politician in either party who doesn’t love bringing home the pork, and the 2022 election campaigning will unofficially kick off shortly after Inauguration Day. Democrats’ pleas for more money now may reflect a desire to get a couple more trillion dollars of pre-Biden spending out of the way (and blamed on president President Trump), so that there is a clean slate for a real spending surge when Joe Biden is in the White House. As it is, the national economy is strong, holiday spending appears to be robust, states that are strapped can muddle through and Sen.

Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who lost her race in November in a Miami-Dade County district that swung toward President Trump after voting overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in 2016.<br />“There’s a lot of fear that many people here will not be able to get back to work, that they don’t know where they’re going to be able to find their next paycheck,” she said.</td>

      <td>Europe hopes to spur an economic recovery from the pandemic by boosting government spending, a shift in strategy from the 2008 financial crisis that economists say could lift the global economy.<br />Two events in the coming week are set to underscore the change.<br />First, European Union leaders on Thursday will begin a series of virtual meetings aimed at gaining final approval of a €750 billion fund, the equivalent of $912 billion, borrowed by the bloc as a whole to aid countries hit hardest by the pandemic’s effects.<br />The European Central Bank the same day will almost certainly announce an expansion of its bond-purchasing program, with the explicit aim of keeping down borrowing costs for governments, thereby enabling them to spend more freely.<br />That combination is intended to place government spending at the heart of efforts to stimulate Europe’s economy in 2021 and beyond.</td>

      <td>From free video calling to a $2,495 stationary bike, here’s a look at how companies used pricing to respond to the coronavirus crisis</td>
      <td>Free Zoom, $13 unlimited  Walmart  delivery, a $30  Disney  movie, a $399 iPhone and a $2,495 Peloton bike: This year, companies in tech and other industries used the lever of pricing in ways that managed the pandemic’s obstacles or even capitalized on its opportunities.<br />Ordinarily, an economic downturn causes a decrease in demand for many products and services. Yet the Covid-19 pandemic’s widely varying impact on different corners of the economy tested traditional pricing approaches. Companies played up conveniences, knocked down barriers and offered new services and new choices—with mixed results. Here’s a look at examples of intriguing price moves this year:<br />“Mulan,” a $200 million live-action remake years in the works, was supposed to have a big theatrical release—but the coronavirus had other plans. Instead,  Walt Disney Co.  charged $30 for at-home “premier access” to the title, for people already paying $6.99 a month for a Disney+ subscription. After three months, “Mulan” became available on the service for no extra charge.<br />In the film industry, it’s common to charge a higher price for early viewing, reducing the price as time goes on. For some, the “Mulan” price was a bargain. Between popcorn, drinks and tickets, a family outing to the theaters easily exceeds that. For others, $30 was too high.<br />During its opening weekend, “Mulan” appeared as No. 10 on Nielsen’s U.S. streaming charts, with 525 million minutes streamed. The list was otherwise dominated by  Netflix Inc.  and topped by the streaming giant’s “Cobra Kai” series, which drew an estimated 2.2 billion streaming minutes.</td>

      <td>Government imposes mandatory measures after failing to contain new surge in infections</td>
      <td>Sweden’s Covid-19 experiment is over.<br />After a late autumn surge in infections led to rising hospitalizations and deaths, the government has abandoned its attempt—unique among Western nations—to combat the pandemic through voluntary measures.<br />Like other Europeans, Swedes are now heading into the winter facing restrictions ranging from a ban on large gatherings to curbs on alcohol sales and school closures—all aimed at preventing the country’s health system from being swamped by patients and capping what is already among the highest per capita death tolls in the world.<br />The clampdown, which started last month, put an end to a hands-off approach that had made the Scandinavian nation a prime example in the often heated global debate between opponents and champions of pandemic lockdowns.<br />Admirers of the Swedish way as far as the U.S. hailed its benefit to the economy and its respect for fundamental freedoms. Critics called it a gamble with human lives, especially those of the most vulnerable. With its shift in strategy, the government is now siding with those advocating at least some mandatory restrictions.</td>

      <td>Covid-19 has accelerated a wave of refinery closures, igniting concerns about energy supply</td>
      <td>A decade ago, Australia was home to seven refineries. Now, it has four. Soon, it could have just one.<br />Covid-19 is accelerating a rash of global refinery shutdowns in the world’s richest economies. Companies from energy giant  Royal Dutch Shell  PLC to Australian fuel company  Ampol Ltd.  are closing facilities or considering doing so as they reckon with anemic fuel demand and growing competition from newer, more efficient fuel-making facilities in Asia and the Middle East.<br />Eleven refineries from the U.S. to Japan have said this year that they intended to close. Three have announced partial shutdowns, and at least another five are on the chopping block, according to analytics firm  IHS Markit .<br />The thinning out is part of a global shift in fuel-making power away from wealthier countries, where demand is in long-term decline and there are many older, smaller refineries. Newer, larger facilities in countries such as China generally are able to produce fuels for less, benefitting from growing regional markets and shipping their products overseas.<br />More than 1.7 million barrels a day worth of refining capacity in countries such as the U.S. and Japan has disappeared or is poised to do so in 2020 and 2021, as China, India and the Middle East add more than 2.2 million barrels a day worth of fuel-making capability, according to the International Energy Agency.</td>

      <td>Republican hopefuls will need to lay the groundwork for potential campaigns of their own without alienating the president and his supporters</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Trump’s public and private musings about running again in 2024 are scrambling the calculus for the large field of fellow Republicans considering bids.<br />Most hopefuls have been quick to show deference. But it’s unclear whether Mr. Trump, who refuses to concede his loss to President-elect Joe Biden, will follow through, and rivals either way will likely seek ways to remain viable. Prospective GOP candidates don’t want to risk alienating Mr. Trump’s base by appearing to push him aside, but they also don’t want to be left unprepared if he decides not to run.<br />“For the last 20 years everyone who has run for president has always started off pretending like they weren’t. You can still do that with the possibility of Trump running again,” said Republican strategist Todd Harris. The 2024 election, he added, “could be the first time loyalty to Trump and political ambition are put on a collision course.”<br />Mr. Trump—who managed to get more than 74 million votes in his losing effort this year—demonstrated his grip on the party base with Saturday’s rally in Georgia for two senators locked in tight runoff elections. “Four more years, four more years,” a shoulder-to-shoulder crowd chanted. He is raising millions of dollars for a newly formed political committee that can fund future campaign activity.<br />“Trump blocks out the sun on all of the other prospective candidates,” said Kevin Madden, a former adviser to Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and now a senator from Utah. “You show up in New Hampshire and talk about the future of the GOP, you immediately put a target on your back with Trump and his followers. Are you willing to take that fight on?”</td>

      <td>Shares have won big this year, not primarily because earnings went up but because the cost of money went down almost to zero</td>
      <td>Many investors are still bewildered that the shock of 2020’s economy gave rise to the awe that is this year’s stock market. The puzzle gets worse: Stocks have done better than their norm of the past century even if you invested at the high in 2007 and held through both the worst financial crisis and worst pandemic in 100 years. What on Earth is going on?<br />The answer should give pause to investors who plan to hold for the long run. Stocks have won big, not primarily because earnings went up but because the cost of money went down almost to zero. A repeat in the next decade is almost inconceivable, which means future returns are likely to be pedestrian, at best.<br />To put some numbers on it, an investor who bought the S&P 500 in October 2007, stayed calm as Lehman Brothers went bust, and ignored the repeated panics and the pandemic made an annualized 7.3% above inflation, including dividends. That is far better than the 6.5% annualized real return on U.S. stocks from 1900 to the start of this year calculated by academics Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton for  Credit Suisse .  It is on a par with the postwar returns of 7.4% over inflation annually from 1950 to the start of the year, despite the great financial crisis and the pandemic, the worst hits to the economy since the second world war.<br />This year is a fine example of why: In 2020, falling earnings coincided with much higher valuations of future earnings, as lower interest rates and bond yields made stocks look more attractive.<br />Unpack that thought and the implication is that we are paying more for the same future stream of income. That is, stocks offer pretty much the same prospective profits and dividends that they did before, but at a higher price. Sure, some biotechnology and videoconferencing stocks have had their growth accelerated by the pandemic, but shareholders of airlines, shopping-mall owners and travel companies will be using a big chunk of future profits to pay for the debt needed to survive 2020. The market assumption is that 2020 is a write-off but that S&P earnings in 2021 will be about 4% above last year’s, and 2022’s will reach roughly where 2021’s were expected to be before the pandemic hit.</td>
