      <td>Shaka King’s thrilling biopic stars Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield as Fred Hampton and the FBI informant who turned on him.</td>
      <td>Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield give a matched pair of phenomenal performances in “Judas and the Black Messiah.” Mr. Kaluuya is Fred Hampton, the controversial chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party in the late 1960s, and Mr. Stanfield is Bill O’Neal, the FBI informant who was instrumental in Hampton’s killing. The film, directed by Shaka King from a script he wrote with Will Berson, is a special sort of twofer—a powerful, and candidly sympathetic, political biography with contemporary relevance, and a morality tale set forth as an exciting action adventure. (The film is playing in theaters and streaming on HBO Max.)<br />It’s impossible to say which of the two characters is dominant. Hampton is prodigiously energetic, violent on occasion and formidably persuasive, a gifted orator who speaks at the velocity of an auctioneer—I won’t pretend I was always able to keep up—and moves his audiences with denunciations of racial injustice and promises of progress through revolutionary action. Hampton was, remarkably, only 21 when he died following an armed pre-dawn raid on his apartment. Mr. Kaluuya is not 21, and he’s English, not American, a source of concern in some circles. Yet the sheer brilliance of his portrayal sweeps away all questions except how in the world he put such a performance together. (We see Hampton listening to the speeches of Martin Luther King Jr., not only for their content but their magisterial cadences. We’re told that Mr. Kaluuya, in his turn, worked with an opera coach as part of his preparation for the role’s hurtling dialogue.)<br />The Judas of the piece, O’Neal, died in 1990; his death was ruled a suicide. In the film’s interpretation, O’Neal is a dunce politically, before and well after he meets Hampton, serves him as a Black Panther security captain and betrays him. A career car thief before infiltrating the Panthers, he had a fondness, grounded in fact, for impersonating an FBI agent, then appropriating car keys from supposed suspects. (In one of the film’s many gripping moments, a couple of Hampton’s lieutenants test O’Neal’s veracity by making him prove that he knows how to hot-wire a car.)<br />Mr. Stanfield’s quiet triumph—you won’t understand the quietude until you see it—lies in making O’Neal affecting, even fascinating, as well as unprincipled and contemptible. He’s a melancholy rat, trapped by his alliance with the FBI. You can almost see the workings of his mind as he tries frantically to grasp the magnitude of what he has signed up for. He lacks the privilege and education of Clerici, the Fascist assassin in Bernardo Bertolucci’s peerless “The Conformist,” but both men share a spiritual emptiness that can’t be filled.<br />The production surrounds its two stars with splendid actors in smaller roles. Jesse Plemons is Roy Mitchell, O’Neal’s FBI handler, a pleasant man perfectly comfortable with putting evil deeds in motion. (The film is unsparing in its depiction of a lawless FBI.) Martin Sheen is unrecognizable, and chilling, as J. Edgar Hoover, famously fearful of the rise of a Black messiah and obsessed with Hampton as the candidate at hand. Dominique Fishback plays Deborah Johnson, Hampton’s girlfriend. Ms. Fishback is appealing, in a conventional way, until she becomes absolutely enchanting in a breathtaking scene that lasts almost three minutes. That’s when Deborah, pregnant with Hampton’s child, pleads her case, with an eloquence equal to his, that life should be more than ceaseless war in the name of social justice.</td>

      <td>Patrick Page stars in a one-man show about Shakespeare’s villains; a woman undergoes surgery to restore her sight in Brian Friel’s play.</td>
      <td>On Broadway, Patrick Page usually plays bad guys, most notably the monstrous villains of “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” and “Hadestown.” Elsewhere, though, he is best known as one of America’s greatest classical actors, blessed with a bass voice so resonant that it can actually make your theater seat shake—I’ve felt it—without benefit of amplification.<br />To capture such a force of nature on a screen is no small trick, but “All the Devils Are Here: How Shakespeare Invented the Villain,” a solo show written and performed by Mr. Page and produced by Washington’s Shakespeare Theatre Company, does the job with seeming ease. Not only does it clearly convey the immense force of his stage presence, but it is also an illuminating introduction to an insufficiently appreciated aspect of Shakespeare’s genius. As Mr. Page says at the outset, “Shakespeare’s two-decade exploration of evil actually made him a more humane and sophisticated writer. In creating an entirely new kind of villain, Shakespeare rejected the prejudices of his age and became a writer for all of us.”<br />Part of what makes “All the Devils Are Here” so accessible is that Mr. Page addresses himself to the home viewer, speaking in a conversational, almost chatty way (“Do you believe in evil spirits? Do you believe in evil?”) and pointing out Shakespeare’s influence on such TV shows as “Breaking Bad” and “House of Cards.” His intended audience is clearly people who like Shakespeare but don’t necessarily know much of anything about him. But when he gets down to business and takes an 80-minute stroll through the rogue’s gallery, he sheds his populist manner like a coat and introduces us to, among others, Richard III (played with a hair-raising smile so horrific that you half expect to see fangs), Iago (whom he plays as a sociopath hiding behind the mask of sanity), Macbeth and his bloodthirsty lady, the vengeful Hamlet and Malvolio, and—yes—even Sir John Falstaff.<br />Along the way, we meet Shylock, whom Mr. Page enacts without a trace of caricature and about whose characterization he speaks with singular penetration: “Shylock is the villain of the play—but for the first time in history, he’s a villain whose motivation is so clear, whose psychology is so complex and whose language is so rich and idiosyncratic that he changes the way we experience villainy itself. Shakespeare forces us to ask ourselves: If we had been treated as Shylock was treated, might we find the same depths of wickedness in ourselves? Could we be evil?”<br />Mr. Page has no fear of the grand gesture, and here as in his stage work, his motto might well be “Go big or go home.” But what is in certain ways most remarkable about his filmed performance is that it never feels at all overdrawn. I confess to wishing that I had been listening on a sound system equipped with a subwoofer, but even on earphones you will relish his organ-pipe voice, and his physical presence all but leaps out of the screen and seizes you by the throat. Appropriately enough, he is dressed in black from top to toe, and the set on which he performs is no less uncluttered: a rug, a desk, two chairs and a coat rack. He has been very well directed for film by Alan Paul and photographed with smooth, flowing simplicity by Joey Ruffini (whose tight closeups are especially striking).</td>

      <td>Lee Isaac Chung’s semi-autobiographical film tells the story of a Korean family relocating to a farm in Arkansas.</td>
      <td><br />The most efficient review of “Minari” would be something along the lines of “It’s wonderful. See it. You’ll love it.” But you need to know more than that about Lee Isaac Chung’s partly autobiographical drama, in which a Korean family settles in Arkansas in the 1980s. This heartfelt, heart-filling celebration of putting down roots—the title refers to a resilient Korean variety of watercress—calls for gratitude and wonderment at how such an outwardly straightforward story could be so intimate, poignant, improbably funny and steadfastly stirring.<br />One clue may involve the film’s deep roots in a classic genre—all those movies and TV shows about immigrants, homegrown pioneers or impoverished Okies confronting harsh new environments where disaster can strike in the form of illness, prejudice, a tornado or a drought. Yet there’s no overt harshness here. The rural Arkansas of “Minari” seems downright congenial, at least to the paterfamilias of the piece, Jacob Yi (Steven Yeun). A chronic optimist, he has brought his wife, Monica (Yeri Han); their daughter, Anne (Noel Kate Cho); and their enchantingly quirky little son, David (Alan Kim), all the way from California, hoping for a desperately needed fresh start. (The film is playing in select theaters nationwide and will start streaming on demand on Feb. 26.)<br />Jacob’s plan seems sound enough. On a plot of land he calls “the best dirt in America,” he’ll grow Korean vegetables for increasing numbers of his compatriots coming to big cities in neighboring states. Meanwhile, he and Monica will put food on their own table with money they make sexing chicks at a nearby hatchery. We learn a lot about sexing chicks from this movie. It’s a dreary job, and the one that Jacob and Monica, born and married in Korea, had been doing in California for a dead-end decade. He’s a speedy wizard at it while she works more slowly, although, he assures her, she’s fast enough for Arkansas.<br />Whether she’s a comfortable fit for Arkansas is another matter. She is appalled by the mobile home Jacob has bought for them to live in. (Their daughter is intrigued. “Wheels!” Anne says, checking out the underpinnings.) And Monica fears the isolation—living on their own in the middle of nowhere, and far from a hospital they might need if David’s heart condition takes a turn for the worse. (“Don’t run, David,” his mother calls whenever he does, which is often.)</td>

      <td>Move, with uncertain impact in Hong Kong, comes after U.K. banned a Chinese news channel</td>
      <td>A Chinese regulator ordered the British Broadcasting Corp. off the airwaves in Chinese territory for news reports it called unfair, days after Beijing’s primary international news channel lost its license in the U.K.<br />The tit-for-tat move shows how media organizations are getting increasingly embroiled in China’s deteriorating relations with the West. London and Beijing have criticized each other’s action as hurting media freedom, depicting the news organizations involved as extensions of each government’s agenda.<br />In the mainland, China’s announcement by the National Radio and Television Administration just past midnight Friday, at the start of the Lunar New Year holiday, appeared mostly symbolic since international broadcasters such as the BBC already have extremely limited reach there. The programming typically can only be seen in upmarket hotels and compounds where foreigners live, and even on those feeds the screens frequently go black when news relates to China.<br />While the Chinese announcement ordered the BBC off the airways in Chinese territory, it wasn’t immediately clear how the ban, set to last at least a year, would affect BBC services in Hong Kong, which has a freer media environment, though Beijing has expanded limits on journalism there.<br />BBC television news remained on the air in Hong Kong early Friday. BBC has deep roots in the former British colony, where its news reports today are carried on local radio and cable TV.</td>

C’mon man,” he said in Iowa, asserting that the country was facing internal problems on a scale much larger than those in the U.S. Mr. Biden added, “They’re not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They’re not competition for us.”</td>

      <td>In the actor’s CNN docuseries, he takes viewers on a delectable food tour featuring local pastas, cheeses and more.</td>
      <td>If you wanted to prepare a Stanley Tucci reduction—a distillation of the actor’s basic essence—you might be left with a single, ironically cocked eyebrow. He is not a performer given to grand gestures. So when he tastes the yolk-fattened spaghetti carbonara in a Roman restaurant, closes both eyes and spontaneously hugs the chef, it is the equivalent of fireworks over the Tiber.<br />“Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy” contains a number of such moments and more than a few “oh my gods!’’ as Mr. Tucci zigzags from region to region, sampling the best of Italian cooking, and Italian chefs, and no doubt tantalizing his audience: Few people are traveling for pleasure right now, and the scope of one’s culinary explorations are largely contained by the borders of the Seamless empire. So while much pleasure can be derived from Mr. Tucci’s food tour, some sour grapes may be on the menu, too.<br />The visuals more than compensate. Shot during a “brief moment of normality” during the pandemic, the six-part series follows the actor around the country of his ancestors, tasting local dishes and reflecting on their origins and history. This is not a new approach to either food or travel TV—Rick Steves, for example, can be seen most nights on PBS offering the same species of programming. But with Mr. Tucci a viewer doesn’t feel he or she is being sold anything. The pizza of Naples, the pasta Amatriciana of Rome, the panzanella of Florence (where “old bread would choose to die,” Mr. Tucci says) sell themselves. The show’s host is our fluent Virgil on a tour of gustatory paradiso.<br />In addition to the vicarious pleasure to be had in someone else’s cacio e pepe, nuggets of history are scattered throughout the series like so many garlic croutons. The story of Naples, for instance, Mr. Tucci’s first stop, combines “two of Italy’s favorite subjects: food and death.” Not only has the unpredictable Vesuvius always haunted Neapolitans, but cholera has been a historic threat in a city of overcrowding and inadequate sanitation. As a precaution, even bread was once fried to avert contagion, and the earliest pizza—which will have viewers salivating—was what Americans think of now as a calzone: a pastry pocket filled with ricotta, pork fat, smoked cheese and basil, deep-fried to the point of plague-free perfection.<br />Pizza is the preoccupation of the Naples episode, which includes a visit with Michelin-rated pizzaioloEnzo Coccia, who walks Mr. Tucci through the making of a perfect pie—the wheat; the buffalo that provide the mozzarella; and the San Marzano tomato, the genuine version of which, we learn, are grown on fewer than 400 acres of soil enriched by Vesuvian ash. In Rome, the focus is elsewhere. “If you’re on a low-carb diet, beware,” Mr. Tucci says. “You’re going to see a lot of pasta. I mean like a lot of pasta. Like a lot.”</td>

They said that before his  Facebook  page was deleted he posted conspiracy theories there about vaccines and QAnon, and engaged with people in heated online debates.<br />Affidavits for the arrest of the five people said they marched as a group with other known members of the Proud Boys, which describes itself as an organization for “Western chauvinists.” Several of those members have been previously arrested on similar charges, and, according to the affidavits, worked to prevent law enforcement from securing the area.<br />Since the riot on Jan. 6, more than 200 participants have been arrested on charges ranging from unlawful entry of a restricted building to assaulting federal officers. Prosecutors have also focused more specifically on alleged members of the Proud Boys and several militia groups including the Oath Keepers, building cases that accuse small subsets of the larger group of rioters of coordinating their actions and planning the assault in advance.</td>

      <td>Deficit for fiscal 2021 will come to $2.3 trillion, almost $900 billion less than projected earlier, as economy revives</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal deficits are projected to soar over the next decade,  but not as much as officials forecast last summer, thanks to an improving economic outlook that is expected to bolster federal revenues, the Congressional Budget Office said Thursday.<br />Federal debt, which reached 100% of gross domestic product in the last fiscal year, is expected to rise to a record 107% of economic output by 2031.<br />The agency expects cumulative deficits over the next 10 years will total $12.6 trillion, 3% less than projected in September, the last time the agency released its estimates. The decline stems from stronger-than-expected economic activity, higher inflation and higher interest rates, which will boost federal tax revenue more than spending, the nonpartisan agency said.<br />Republicans in Congress who object to President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package have pointed to growing budget deficits and debt as a reason to keep spending in check. They also argue the economy is already poised for stronger growth this year. Democrats, who control the House and Senate with narrow majorities, are on track to approve the bill.<br />Financial markets have shown little concern about the deficit, as inflation stays low and investors around the world seek the safety of U.S. Treasury securities. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 1.133% on Wednesday following a report that consumer price increases remain limited.</td>

As Daimler-Benz’s director of motorsports, Neubauer (1891-1980) presided over two generations of all-conquering racers: the Silver Arrows of 1934-1939 and the 300 SLs, circa 1952-1955. The last time Neubauer saw such a grille, it was attached to the winner of the 1952 Carrera Panamericana Mexico, a sleek, masculine endurance machine. Here it is not. So not.<br />What say you, Herr Neubauer? Can design history be misquoted, or at least taken out of context? And would you please not drink all my liquor?<br />Introduced last year, the GLB compact SUV is a new body style for  Mercedes-Benz  and it is rather determinedly unsleek. The largest crossover among the vehicles built on Mercedes’s CLA architecture, the GLB casts about the same size shadow as an Audi Q5 or Land Rover Discovery Sport, but its volumes and proportions are more like a Mini Countryman scaled at 105%. Please note the more upright windscreen angle, lower sill line, level roof line, taller sections of glass, more prominent lower cladding and hatch-ier hatch, compared to most of the GLB’s siblings. This more forthright squareness is emphasized by brightwork window trim.<br />Speaking of alternative timelines, our black-on-black test car looked like a London taxi if Germany had won the war, a la “The Man in the High Castle.”</td>

Chuck Schumer urges debt forgiveness for students who borrowed their way through college, he ignores how this decision will inflict the burden of those same loans on others across the country (“White House Weighs Student-Debt Forgiveness,” U.S. News, Feb. 5). Many opted for other less costly educational opportunities, chose to go to work over attending college, worked while attending college, saved before attending college or chose degrees capable of providing income sufficient to repay their loans. Many brave men and women joined our armed forces and risked their lives to be provided an avenue to attend college when they completed their military service. By increasing the tax burden necessary to pay for debt cancellation, entitled individuals would prevent a whole other segment of our society from “buying cars, from going on vacation, from starting families.”<br />Maybe the colleges with the multimillion-dollar endowment funds that are benefiting from these overpriced educations should be on the hook for the forgiveness of the debt and not the U.S. taxpayer.<br />Patrick Demetruk<br />Stephenville, Texas<br /></td>

      <td>Peggy Noonan is correct when she says that most people aren’t “passionately immersed in politics” and that they “see politics as it goes by on their screens” (“Liz Cheney Wins One for Sanity,” Declarations, Feb. 6). What they’ve witnessed in the last 50 years is that every time a hard truth is gently given it’s defeated by the blitzkrieg of Democratic special-interest groups that have never found a hill they were not willing to die on. Many conservatives who have viewed this have become demoralized and discouraged with the America they see and live in.<br />So, I ask Ms. Noonan, who is really to blame for the bully who occupied the White House for the last four years? Is it those who sought someone to fight for them or is it the Republican Party that never understood its opponents enough to fight them on their terms, to stand for hard truths and to find at least one hill they were willing to die on?<br />Keith P.

      <td>Regarding Scott Gottlieb and Mark McClellan’s “What to Do When There’s a Covid-19 Vaccine Glut” (op-ed, Feb. 8): The unspoken danger with regard to a substantial portion of the population refusing immunization resides in the mutagenic nature of the virus itself. Every unvaccinated individual who becomes infected becomes a potential incubator for a viral strain that mutates beyond the protective effects of the antibodies generated by both vaccines and the immune systems of previously infected individuals.<br />We have already seen, in less than a year, the emergence of a strain in Africa that shows substantially reduced responsiveness to immunity generated by the current vaccines. If strains emerge in the unvaccinated that have evolved to evade developed immunity, the entire global program of vaccination will have been neutered and we’ll need to develop new vaccines to counter the new threat, while the virus continues to evolve, unchecked in the unvaccinated, previously vaccinated and previously infected.<br />People concerned for older family members and sick family and friends need to seriously consider that their loved ones’ developed immunity from vaccination can be neutralized by viruses evolved in the young who see no personal protective effect in a vaccine.<br />The life we save by getting vaccinated might be a loved one’s.<br />Gerard M.

      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal prosecutors and regulators are investigating whether market manipulation or other types of misconduct fueled the rapid rise last month in prices of stocks such as  GameStop Corp.  and  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,  according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The Justice Department’s fraud section and the San Francisco U.S. attorney’s office have sought information about the activity from brokers and social-media companies that were hubs for the trading frenzy, the people said. Prosecutors have subpoenaed information from brokers such as Robinhood Markets Inc., the popular online brokerage that many individual investors used to trade GameStop and other shares, the people said.<br />GameStop shares surged from about $20 to $483 over a period of two weeks in January. The stock has since fallen to around $50. It was fueled by an army of bullish individual traders exhorting one another on Reddit to buy the shares and squeeze hedge funds that bet the price would fall. Traders who bet stock prices will decline are known as short sellers.<br />In addition to the probe by the Justice Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is examining similar trading, the people said. The CFTC has opened a preliminary investigation into whether misconduct occurred as some Reddit traders targeted silver futures and the largest exchange-traded fund tied to silver, the  iShares Silver Trust ,  one of the people said.<br />The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the trading frenzy as well. The SEC and CFTC are civil regulators. The burden of proof in a regulatory enforcement action is lower than in a criminal case.</td>

      <td>Today’s often toxic social-media environment calls for a fix that puts choices back in the hands of consumers. A new layer of ‘middleware’ can do that.</td>
      <td>Twitter ’s  decision to kick Donald Trump off its platform was welcomed by many liberals as a necessary response to a president who had incited the January 6 storming of Congress. But many of those not particularly friendly to Mr. Trump were nonetheless troubled that Twitter had grown so powerful that it could silence a U.S. president. The Russian anticorruption activist Alexei Navalny, in a series of tweets a few days before his recent arrest, expressed similar worries about Twitter using its power against champions of democracy.<br />The prevailing approach to protecting political speech on the major digital platforms has been to pressure the companies to self-regulate by creating, for instance, oversight boards of outside experts. But leaving these momentous decisions in the hands of private companies is not a long-term solution; they have neither the legitimacy nor the capacity to make such decisions in the public interest.<br />The core issue is the oversize power of Twitter,  Facebook  and Google in controlling political discourse. One measure with some congressional support is to repeal or change Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which limits the liability of platforms for the content they carry. But reform could hurt small companies more than the established giants, who can more easily develop algorithms and hire personnel to filter out problematic content.<br />The question is how to reduce the power of today’s digital monopolists without losing the substantial social value they offer. We believe that a structural solution is possible: requiring the dominant platforms to allow users to select their own output from the algorithms. This would depend on the creation of a new kind of “middleware.” The term normally refers to software that connects operating systems with applications, but we envision software that puts a filtering layer between big platforms and their users. It would give consumers a simple, powerful tool to manage the content that reaches them.<br />The problem with today’s digital monopolists is not that they carry fake news or conspiracy theories; this content is unfortunately widespread, and the First Amendment protects Americans’ right to express what they want. The real harm comes from those few companies’ ability to amplify certain voices while excluding others. This power is a product of scale economies, in which one large platform generates more attention, participation and value than multiple smaller ones, and a business model that relies on capturing user attention for advertisers. These platforms squeeze out alternative platforms while fueling virality, thereby advancing the loudest, most provocative voices.</td>

      <td>In the past sommeliers have guided wine drinkers to grower Champagnes—idiosyncratic, expressive, the antithesis of anodyne big brands. This year tracking them down might be a labor of love, but special bottles and great values await the tenacious.</td>
      <td>OF ALL THE clever wine terms coined over the years, “farmer fizz” may be my favorite. Credited to Champagne importer Terry Theise, it’s a term that retailers and sommeliers have happily adopted. And why not? Fizz from a farmer sounds like something friendly and fun, a down-to-earth drink quite unlike an elitist bottle from a big Champagne house.<br />Farmer fizz is Champagne made by grape growers who choose not to sell all their fruit to the big houses. Though some growers have always made their own wines, only in the past few decades has it become commonplace. Thanks to the importers and sommeliers who championed the wines stateside, farmer fizz, aka grower Champagne, has gained a devoted following in the past 20 years.<br />Last year, world-wide sales of Champagne were down by 18% compared with the previous year according to the trade organization Comité Champagne. The closure of many restaurants was doubtless a factor: Sommeliers have always played a key role in guiding drinkers to the wines. Still, some growers actually did very well in 2020—even reporting record sales.<br />According to Gabriel Clary, Champagne portfolio manager of Skurnik Wines & Spirits in Manhattan, Champagnes from established growers saw an uptick in sales thanks to wine merchants who purchased large quantities. Champagnes from less-established growers haven’t fared as well, he noted.<br />The Skurnik Champagne portfolio includes the selection of grower Champagnes once curated by Mr. Theise, whose 20-plus-year partnership with Skurnik ended early last year. Mr. Theise credits sommeliers with playing a key role in the success of the wines, and one of his most successful sales tools was his annual Champagne catalog, an education on the region, its growers and their wines. His frequently flamboyant prose inspired many in the business. “He wrote the stories of farmers so beautifully, and story is such an important part of grower Champagne,” said Jason Jacobeit, wine director of Bâtard restaurant in Manhattan (currently closed), as well as owner and managing partner of Somm Cellars Wine & Spirits, where he stocks a wide selection of grower Champagnes. He discovered many of them as a sommelier, thanks to Mr. Theise.</td>

Australia’s effort gained momentum last year, when the pandemic-driven downturn further strained the finances of media companies.<br />“The United States should not object to a creative Australian proposal that strengthens democracy by requiring tech companies to support a free press,” Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post published Thursday. “It should copy it instead.”</td>

      <td>Whether religious services are ‘essential’ isn’t a matter for government to decide.</td>
      <td>These days “follow the science” has become a cliché especially popular with government leaders. But when it comes to the constitutional right to worship, California began to follow the science only after a recent Supreme Court intervention.<br />Political elites issuing health orders that they themselves don’t obey—and destroying countless livelihoods without any scientific basis for such action—is infuriating. But it was especially so for us Catholics, who have scientific evidence that positively demonstrates we can celebrate Mass safely indoors. In lifting California’s blanket ban on indoor worship, the high court rightly acknowledged the blatant unfairness of treating religious worship differently from secular activities such as shopping.<br />It’s been a long fight. Even as the pandemic subsided last summer and secular businesses began to open up, we still had to fight San Francisco City Hall for our right to worship. At the time the local government’s health orders were even more severe than California’s statewide policies. For months, San Francisco banned outdoor gatherings of more than 12 people—even as street protests were conveniently allowed and some city officials even participated.<br />After numerous attempts at respectful dialogue with the pertinent city officials went nowhere, my patience finally wore out. I began to criticize City Hall publicly and gather groups for multiple simultaneous outdoor Masses. In September, the city raised the numerical limit for outdoor gatherings but issued a ruling that only one person at a time would be allowed in a church for private prayer. That prompted a warning letter from the U.S. Justice Department calling on the city to “immediately equalize its treatment of places of worship to comply with the First Amendment.”<br />The issue became more intense as Christmas approached. We were already locked out of our churches for Easter, and I could not stomach this happening again. On Dec. 18 I sent my priests a memo giving them permission to bring the congregation indoors if weather or safety required it. The church could be filled only to 20% capacity—then the rule for indoor retail—and strict safety protocols had to be followed: masks, social distancing, sanitation and ventilation. The state health order did not follow the science, and I knew my people had to have access to the Eucharist, rain or shine. Like all the sacraments, it cannot be livestreamed. By mid-January several parishes had begun receiving ominous warnings from government officials, and two were officially cited for violations by the city Department of Public Health.</td>

      <td>QALANSUWA, Israel—After years of alienating Israel’s Arab voters, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now courting them, hoping they hold the key to staying in power.<br />Mr. Netanyahu has long campaigned against Israel’s Arab citizens, who make up about 20% of the country’s population, accusing their leaders of supporting terror and warning that their increased voting power could drive his right-wing government from power. In 2019, analysts and Arab voters accused his party of trying to suppress Arab votes by installing cameras in polling places.<br />Now, ahead of the March 23 national elections, Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving leader, hopes Arab Israeli votes could boost his party enough to help him form a government. He and his political allies are seeking to exploit discontent among Arabs with their own leadership, while offering the promise of a bigger role in government to address deepening problems of crime and poverty.<br />But Mr. Netanyahu faces skepticism and even hostility from many Arab Israelis over his about-face.<br />“Netanyahu is a big liar, he sees us as subjects and not citizens. He does not have enough Jews—so he came to play us, the Arabs,” said Ayman Odeh, chairman of the Joint List, a group of political parties largely representing the country’s Arab population, in an interview with Israel’s Army Radio. During a campaign stop in Nazareth in January, protesters, some waving Palestinian flags, accused Mr. Netanyahu of trying to split the Arab community and peel off some of its votes.</td>

      <td>Last fall, the paparazzi snapped the actor in a cashmere flannel with mega-checks that cost around $2,000—and the shirt went viral. Equally arresting but less paralyzingly priced: these five cotton options.</td>
      <td>IT WAS THE flannel that shot across the internet. In mid-November, actor, producer and perennial hair icon Brad Pitt was handing out groceries in Los Angeles as a charitable gesture in the lead-up to Thanksgiving. The paparazzi on hand captured Mr. Pitt’s charmingly casual outfit: a pair of white slip-on sneakers, distressed (but likely pricy) blue jeans and a flannel shirt with an unusually intense red, black and white check pattern. That beguiling flannel stole the show and fans raced to identify it. Though they floated many theories online, few picked the right brand: A representative for Mr. Pitt confirmed that the shirt is by God’s True Cashmere, a minuscule shirt company run by holistic healer and jewelry designer Sat Hari Khalsa, whose cashmere flannels can be had for around $2,000.<br />Even in the grainy, zoomed-in photographs that colonized the internet, it was possible to decipher what made Mr. Pitt’s shirt special, apart from its breathtaking price. The flannel itself was far hardier than the wafery material you usually find at shops like the Gap or Uniqlo. And its tri-colored checks were atypically large and graphic, shot through with fine, dotted lines.<br />The pattern’s blown-out scale is what takes this flannel from a simple shirt to a sensation. Dan Snyder, the owner of Corridor, a Brooklyn-based clothing label, described the print as a “macro” plaid: It’s as if a plaid pattern were viewed under a microscope and then a shirtmaker transferred that zoomed-in perspective onto a button-up. Mr. Snyder noted that few textile manufacturers actually make such overscaled patterns today. That’s why eagle-eyed commenters online were convinced that Mr. Pitt’s flannel had to be vintage, with some specifically pointing to brands like Big Mac, a workwear label started by JC Penney in 1922.<br />A few years ago, Mr. Snyder stumbled across a shirt scrap with a similarly exploded pattern that he guessed dated to the 1930s—and he took inspiration from it for his company’s Acid Plaid shirts. These wavy flannels echo the loud nature of Mr. Pitt’s (some customers asked Mr. Snyder if the “Ocean’s Eleven” star was wearing an Acid Plaid in the celebrated photo) at a much quieter price point.<br />Other more-affordable Pitt-like plaids come from brands like Freenote, Sugar Cane and Warehouse which produce, with a very reverent touch, workwear staples evocative of decades past. Made from cotton, their burly blown-out plaids might not match the cashmere prestige of Mr. Pitt’s shirt, but at around $1,700 less, they offer savings that more than offset the trade-off.</td>

A deal could value Ardent at more than $2 billion with debt, some of the people said, adding that the closely held companies, which have been in on-and-off talks, may not reach an agreement.<br />Nashville-based Ardent operates acute-care hospitals and clinics in growing urban and suburban areas, with its biggest presence in Texas and Oklahoma. Equity Group purchased Ardent in 2015 and since then has added to its holdings and more than doubled its revenue—to $4.4 billion in 2020, according to its website.<br />Apollo took LifePoint private in November 2018 in a deal valued around $5.6 billion including debt, with a plan to merge it with existing holding RCCH HealthCare Partners and continue to buy up other Nashville-area healthcare companies. Like RCCH, LifePoint was based in Brentwood, Tenn., a Nashville suburb.<br />Should a deal be reached, it would be a significant move by LifePoint to diversify into larger hospitals and clinics in densely populated areas after focusing on rural areas, which could bring risks. But a combination is also likely to bring cost savings, mainly in the form of improved purchasing power with suppliers and streamlined management.</td>

      <td>Food companies keep indicating that their good fortune last year will extend into this one. Investors might be ready to start listening.<br />Kraft Heinz  reported solid fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. Organic sales, a key industry metric that strips out the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and currency fluctuations, rose 6% in the quarter from a year earlier, compared with analyst expectations for 4.8% growth, according to Visible Alpha. This follows growth of around 6% to 7% over each of the prior three quarters as consumers ate more at home amid the coronavirus pandemic, boosting the entire sector.<br />The company also guided for flat to positive organic sales growth in the first quarter of 2021, paired with low single-digit growth in adjusted earnings. This is notable because it is measured against an extraordinarily high base; it was in March of last year when consumers rushed to stock up their pantries. Granted, the pandemic has stretched on in January and February, keeping many out of restaurants. But the fact that the company still sees sales at a comparable level to that frantic period is significant.<br />On a conference call, company executives were cautious about giving a full-year sales forecast, citing the volatility of the pandemic situation. But Chief Financial Officer Paulo Basilio did say the company is confident that full-year financial performance will exceed what was envisioned in the company’s strategic plan unveiled in September. That plan gave no specific targets for 2021 but called for long-term annual growth of 2% to 3% in adjusted earnings.<br />Kellogg  on Thursday reported somewhat less impressive results, with organic sales rising just 2.5% year on year, compared with expectations of 4.1%. It also said that it sees full-year organic sales falling just 1% over all of 2021. Taken together, these forecasts suggest that packaged-food demand could stabilize at a high level this year, and that it certainly won’t suffer a sharp reversal.</td>

Someone had ordered a pair of the ample, minimalist walking shoes online and as he packed the order, Mr. Wright, now 24, thought, “Who on earth under the age of 50 would buy these shoes?” He couldn’t have predicted that just a few years later he would own not just one pair of Mephistos, but three. From his teen years to young adulthood, his taste in shoes has evolved from hyped-up sneakers to sensible, comfortable, even orthopedic-style shoes.<br />In 2021, practical walking shoes are being curiously co-opted by spry 20- and 30-somethings. What footwear falls into this category? Anything that you could pilfer from a retirement-home denizen: for example, the outdoorsy Merrell Jungle Moc with its tractioned rubber sole; Keen’s springy, elasticized Uneek sandal; and the extremely gray Journey Mesh sneaker made by 45-year-old American brand San Antonio Shoemakers, which boasts a “Tripad Technology” shock-absorbing sole.<br />Men have long sought comfort from their shoes, but the pandemic has led them to prioritize comfort over presentability or panache. When your date calendar has been wiped clean, you’re going to rely more on your mushy, errand-run Merrells than your polished Allen Edmonds loafers. “People just want to be a little bit more cozy. I think that practicality is what people are gravitating toward right now,” said Stefano Gugliotta, 29, a Florida-based social media manager for a national chain of car dealerships who also runs @obscuresneakers, an Instagram account with nearly 75,000 followers that pays homage to little-known shoes.<br />Early on, his account featured Avia high-top basketball shoes from the 1980s and long-forgotten Adidas tennis shoes, but lately he’s been mixing in images of plush Subu slip-ons, curvaceous Teva sandals and hard-to-find Oakley mules. By featuring these functional, gorpcore-ish shoes, Mr. Gugliotta is capturing a shift toward footwear that is decidedly unprecious. These are not Jordans you have to polish with a toothbrush, or Air Force Ones you’d baby so as to not crease the leather. These are practical shoes you can put through the wringer.<br />Not everyone understands why geriatric walking shoes are catching on with a more limber generation, though. Recently, Ryan Chang, 32, a writing professor in Los Angeles, went to his local SAS store to buy Journey sneakers, which look a little like New Balance shoes minus the logo. After Mr. Chang asked to try them on, the salesperson shot him what he called a “puzzled look.” Apparently, men with as few grays as he has rarely request Journeys for themselves. Regardless, Mr. Chang cherishes his new pair.</td>

      <td>In a go-go market, who needs Wall Street research reports? Just take a quick glance at the recommendation and price target and get busy trading. But a portfolio manager who merely skims Stifel analyst Scott Devitt’s Wednesday note with a “buy” recommendation on  Uber Technologies  and a $67 price target is missing out.<br />“In our opinion, there is a lot of nonsense in financial markets at the moment. It is hard to know whether one should take much of anything seriously until this period of euphoria ends. We are analysts so it’s better to have something to recommend, even if just on a relative basis.”<br />That is hardly a typical Wall Street seal of approval. Even the math behind his target is underwhelming. Mr. Devitt notes that Uber shares trade at 33 times projected 2024 earnings. “If nothing goes wrong in the world (or at Uber) over the next three years, an investor could eke out an okay equity return, assuming current valuations hold up. If we are wrong, it’s likely to be because everything is overvalued and there will be better entry points in the future.”<br />In case that left investors who bothered to read the summary feeling uninspired, even nervous, Mr. Devitt signed off with an inspirational message: “go get em folks.”</td>

      <td>Researchers aim to measure how much immune response a shot triggers—potentially useful for assessing new shots and new uses</td>
      <td>As more Covid-19 vaccines become available in the U.S., it is getting tougher to run large clinical trials to test a new vaccine’s ability to prevent disease because people are less willing to take a placebo—forcing drugmakers and researchers to look for workarounds as they vet the next generation of shots and test new uses for authorized ones.<br />One potential workaround would be to determine what level of immune response a vaccine has to trigger to protect people from the coronavirus, as measured in blood samples, and to use that information to create smaller, faster and less-expensive clinical trials.<br />Instead of requiring tens of thousands of volunteers and costing several hundred-million dollars, such trials could involve only hundreds of people at a fraction of the cost. They could be used to speed the availability of new vaccines targeting emerging variants.<br />Moderna Inc.,   Pfizer  and its partner  BioNTech SE ,  and a federally funded network of researchers are conducting analyses to learn what immune response is necessary for protection with current vaccines, known as an immune correlate of protection. They say it could come in handy for new studies of already-authorized vaccines—such as testing the shots in children or whether reduced doses are effective—as well as for trials of the next generation of shots, including those targeting new coronavirus strains. Over time, such knowledge could also help determine how long protection from the vaccines lasts.<br />Another workaround is to run future large efficacy trials outside the U.S., in places where viral transmission is high and vaccine availability is more limited.  Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc.,  whose Covid-19 vaccine is in mid-stage testing, may run a large Phase 3 trial of its experimental shot outside the U.S. because of the diminishing feasibility of running it in the U.S., Chief Executive Joseph Payne said in an interview. The company hasn’t disclosed which country or countries.</td>

      <td>Forecasters are increasingly optimistic about economic growth this year, though less so about the labor market’s prospects, as it recovers from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, a new Wall Street Journal survey shows.<br />Economists on average expected gross domestic product to expand nearly 4.9% this year, measured from the fourth quarter of the prior year, according to the business and academic economists surveyed in February, an improvement from their 4.3% forecast in January. They cited the distribution of Covid-19 vaccinations and the prospect of additional fiscal relief from Washington for the brightening outlook.<br />However, they were more cautious about the recovery in jobs. Economists this month on average expected employers to add 4.8 million jobs this year, down from the 5.0 million they projected in January and equal to just half of the 9.6 million jobs lost since February 2020. The forecasters saw a mean unemployment rate of 5.3% by year’s end, about the same level they projected in last month’s survey. The Labor Department said Friday the national jobless rate was 6.3% in January.<br />“The economy is already picking up some growth momentum in the first quarter,” said Brian Bethune, professor of economics at Boston College. “The large $1.9 trillion stimulus package will provide significant insurance against a relapse into recession,” he said, referring to President Biden’s proposal.<br />More than half of the respondents said the amount of fiscal aid the economy needs to recover from the coronavirus shock was less than $1 trillion, while only one said that more than $2 trillion was required.</td>

But Justice Department officials have discussed keeping Mr. Sherwin in a different post to continue overseeing the riot investigation, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The Justice Department asked prosecutors from around the country to apply for assignments of as long as nine months  to work on the probe, reporting to the Washington U.S. attorney’s office, according to people familiar with the requests—a sign that the investigation is expected to last well into the new administration, with dozens of people working on it full-time.</td>

      <td>After-tax incomes for bottom 20% of households would rise by 20% under plan moving through House committees</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Congressional Democrats are using coronavirus relief legislation to advance a vision of federal aid to households that is focused on cash assistance with few restrictions, moving away from the work requirements and minimum-income thresholds that have been cornerstones of federal policies for decades.<br />The bill’s $1,400 per-person direct payments, expansion of the child tax credit and extension of unemployment insurance all would provide flexible cash to households. Democrats have emphasized the breadth of households’ needs during the pandemic and have rejected Republicans’ concerns that giving people money would discourage them from returning to work.<br />For lower-income and middle-income households, the combination of policies in the Democrats’ legislation could yield significant short-term increases in income. While unemployment benefits have an application process and eligibility restrictions, direct payments and the child tax credit expansion would have no strings attached, and they are available even to households with no income.<br />The bottom 20% of households by income would see their after-tax incomes rise by 20% because of the plan’s direct payments and tax credit expansions, according to the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. That group would get an average benefit of $2,810, while the middle 20% of households would get an average of $3,360, or 5.5% of after-tax income.<br />Higher-income households would get smaller amounts, and for now, Democrats are waiting before advancing the tax increases on top earners they promised during last year’s campaign.</td>

It could even go as high as $60,584.<br />The rate the hospital charges depends on the insurance plan covering the birth. At the bottom end of the scale is a local health plan that serves largely Medicaid recipients. At the top are prices for women whose plans don’t have the San Francisco hospital in their insurers’ network.<br />The nation’s roughly 6,000 hospitals have begun to reveal the secret rates they negotiate with insurers for a range of procedures. The data offer the first full look inside the confidential deals that set healthcare rates for insurers and employers covering more than 175 million Americans. The submissions also illuminate how widely prices vary—even for the same procedure, performed in the same facility—depending on who is paying.<br />“It is shining a light on the insanity of U.S. healthcare pricing,” said Niall Brennan, chief executive of the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes medical costs. “It’s at the center of the affordability crisis in American healthcare.”<br />Under a Trump administration rule that took effect in January, nearly all hospitals must make their prices public, a move the industry sued to block. Courts rejected hospitals’ arguments that their prices should remain under wraps. Healthcare economists say these rates are a major driver of U.S. medical costs, the highest in the world, and they are largely paid by American companies and workers.</td>

Min Aung Hlaing’s rule?<br />A flurry of discussions followed. In the end, many, including the U.S., sent deputies rather than ambassadors. Some kept their cameras off. Others expressed condemnation of the takeover, according to four diplomats with knowledge of the meeting.<br />“It was a statement—not to be there in any way to give the impression that this was OK, or that we were OK with the coup,” one of the diplomats said. “On the other hand, we want to keep diplomatic channels open.”<br />The episode captures the dilemma many in the international community face over if and how to engage with the regime of Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who last week ended Myanmar’s decadelong transition to democracy. Even before he wrested absolute control, Washington had slapped sanctions on him over alleged human-rights abuses, and his army’s brutal campaigns became the subject of a continuing genocide case at the U.N.’s top court.<br />Since the Feb. 1 coup, a number of foreign governments have tried to get him to back down. On Wednesday, President Biden said the U.S. would impose fresh sanctions against the military leadership. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke this week with officials from India and Japan, who have influence in the country, to apply pressure. New Zealand suspended all ties and declared the regime illegitimate.</td>

      <td>LONDON— AstraZeneca  PLC said it was fixing problems with the manufacturing of its Covid-19 vaccine and expects to roughly double monthly production to 200 million doses by April, as it seeks to move past a rocky start to the shot’s rollout.<br />The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker reported strong full-year earnings and forecast increased 2021 earnings growth. The forecast doesn’t factor in sales of the pandemic vaccine it developed alongside the University of Oxford.<br />Like other vaccine makers, AstraZeneca and Oxford are working on new versions of the shot to target existing and emerging variants of the coronavirus. The drugmaker said Thursday it hoped to reach production of an adapted vaccine at scale within six to nine months, using clinical-trial data and manufacturing agreements already in place.<br />Last year, AstraZeneca stumbled in communicating clinical-trial results and more recently, suffered a shortfall in doses pledged to the European Union. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot and other executives said Thursday they were working out production kinks and would meet targets to deliver more than 400 million doses to rich and poor countries in coming months. That follows green lights in the U.K., Europe and beyond for the vaccine’s use, which isn’t approved yet for U.S. use.<br />This week, the World Health Organization recommended the shot for broad global use, including in countries battling a new strain of the coronavirus first detected in South Africa. Limited trial data have suggested the vaccine is less effective against that version of the virus, though its appears to hold up against a fast-spreading variant first seen in the U.K., particularly against severe symptoms.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—As the Biden administration charts its course on China policy, a coming political appointment to a key Commerce Department post could offer clues to how the White House will address security risks posed by Chinese tech companies.<br />At issue is who should lead the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, an agency that reaches back to the Cold War and is now at the forefront of dealing with heightened U.S.-China tensions over advanced technology.<br />The 450-person bureau oversees the nation’s export-control rules, giving it a big role in deciding which technologies are exported to China, which are blocked, and which Chinese companies wind up on a Commerce Department blacklist.<br />Two of the leading candidates for the post of undersecretary for industry and security represent a clear contrast in direction, according to trade groups and policy analysts following the situation.<br />One is Kevin Wolf, 54 years old, an export-control lawyer and former Obama administration official who is highly regarded for his encyclopedic knowledge of export regulations, but who has come under criticism while in private practice for assisting American companies seeking exemptions to the U.S. blacklist on technology exports.</td>

      <td>Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , the nation’s oldest bank, is making the leap into the market for cryptocurrencies.<br />The custody bank said Thursday it will hold, transfer and issue bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on behalf of its asset-management clients. In time, BNY Mellon will allow those digital assets to pass through the same plumbing used by managers’ other, more traditional holdings—from Treasurys to technology stocks—using a platform that is now in prototype. The bank is already discussing plans with clients to bring their digital currencies into the fold.<br />“Digital assets are becoming part of the mainstream,” said Roman Regelman, chief executive of BNY Mellon’s asset-servicing and digital businesses.<br />It’s a big step for Wall Street’s back-office banks, whose concerns over regulatory, legal and stability risks left them reluctant to come into direct contact with crypto markets. But as prices of bitcoin and other digital assets have continued to rise, they have become more popular with asset managers, hedge funds and other institutional investors.<br />And those firms’ top executives started asking BNY Mellon and their peers to treat digital assets as they would their other holdings, Mr. Regelman said.</td>

As of Thursday morning, the three stocks most mentioned on that forum in the past 24 hours were Canadian cannabis companies, according to Swaggy Stocks, a website that tracks mentions of a company’s ticker symbol on the WallStreetBets.<br />The buzz online has sent shares of the three companies— Sundial Growers ,   Tilray  and Aphria—soaring on Nasdaq. Sundial rose 79% on Wednesday, while Tilray gained 51% and Aphria advanced 11%.<br />Stocks in cannabis companies have been rallying since late last year on investors’ bets that the Biden administration will be more favorable to the industry. But just this week, the prices of both Sundial and Tilray have more than doubled.<br />The recent surge is the latest example of individual investors banding together to drive up prices in small companies. The practice has long been common in the cryptocurrency market, where traders target an asset that can be easily moved. That behavior has increasingly spilled over into the stock market as millions of individuals, stuck at home over the past year because of the coronavirus pandemic, have turned to day trading through brokerages such as Robinhood Markets Inc.</td>

      <td>Energy giant joins peers it pledging to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels while tapping the growing electricity market</td>
      <td>LONDON— Royal Dutch Shell  PLC said it would start reducing oil production, calling an end to a decades-old strategy centered on pumping more hydrocarbons as it and other energy giants seek to capitalize on a shift to low-carbon power.<br />Shell said Thursday its oil production had already peaked and it expects output to decline 1-2% a year, including from asset sales, reducing its exposure to commodity prices over the longer term. At the same time, the company said it would double the amount of electricity it sells and roll out thousands of new electric-vehicle charging points.<br />The strategy follows similar plans from rivals  BP  PLC and  Total SE  to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels while expanding in renewable power such as wind and solar, partly in response to growth in regulatory and investor pressure.<br />BP plans to reduce its oil-and-gas output by 40% in the coming decade. Over the same period, Total wants to reduce its sales of oil products such as gasoline and diesel by 30%, while increasing sales of natural gas, electricity and biofuels.<br />However, the pivot is seen by analysts as challenging because it requires investments in areas where major oil companies don’t necessarily have a competitive advantage and that have lower returns. Renewables projects typically generate returns of around 10%, compared with the traditional 15% targeted on oil-and-gas projects.</td>

Entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban said he is involved with building an audio-focused social platform, called Fireside, which will compete with Clubhouse. A person familiar with the project said it would launch this year.<br />The new social apps are attracting prominent figures and an array of users, including performers seeking an audience, startup founders in search of mentorship, and videogamers looking for fellow players. They have also drawn users bumped off other platforms for spreading conspiracy theories, politicians drumming up support and pandemic-weary people seeking novel ways to connect amid lockdowns.</td>

But even as the nation emerges from the crisis, it won’t yet be time for the central bank to pull back on its $120 billion a month in bond buying, she told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.<br />“For now, we have policy in a good place,” Ms. Daly said. “If you take the lens of my modal outlook, then it’s really continuing to purchase at the current pace through the end of this year.”<br />If the economy delivers the robust growth in the second half of the year that most central bankers expect, “then I can see the need to keep the current pace as not being as critical” starting some time next year, she said.<br />Ms. Daly was interviewed ahead of remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Fed leader also said he sees no reason for the central bank to pull back on aid for the economy, saying the asset purchases are “a key part of what we’re doing in providing overall accommodation to the economy…We’re not thinking about shrinking the balance sheet.”</td>

Many companies are pushing workplace return dates to September—and beyond—or refusing to commit to specific dates, telling employees it will be a wait-and-see remote-work year.<br />The delays span industries.  Qurate Retail Inc.,  the parent company of brands such as Ballard Designs, QVC and HSN, recently shifted its planned May return to offices in the Philadelphia area, Atlanta and other cities until September at the earliest. TechnologyAdvice, a marketing firm in Nashville, initially told employees to plan on Feb. 1 as their return date. The company then pushed the date back to August. Now, TA has decided it will begin a hybrid in-office schedule in the fall of 2021, letting workers choose whether to work remotely or come in, the company says.<br />Return-to-office dates have shifted so much in the past year that some companies aren’t sharing them with employees. Shipping giant  United Parcel Service Inc.,  based in Atlanta, and financial-services firm Fidelity Investments Inc., based in Boston, haven’t announced return dates, instead telling workers signing on from home that the companies are monitoring the coronavirus pandemic and will call workers back when it is safe.<br />Nearly a year of makeshift work at home has weighed on employees, leaders say. While many companies say productivity is up, executives worry that creativity is suffering and say that burnout is on the rise. Even so, bosses struggle to say when things will change.</td>

      <td>Seventeen Republican senators would need to join all Democrats to convict Trump</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—House impeachment managers on Thursday will continue setting out their case against former President Donald Trump for allegedly inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, an effort aimed at persuading enough Republican senators to convict him.<br />On the third day of the impeachment trial, House Democrats have another eight hours to present evidence. Once the managers finish, Mr. Trump’s legal team will have 16 hours to present his defense.<br />Some Republican senators ended Wednesday concluding that the impeachment managers, through the use of video and audio, had painted a horrifying portrait of the rioters who stormed the Capitol, but many said that they hadn’t shown that the violence was a direct result of Mr. Trump’s rhetoric. If all 50 Democrats vote to convict the former president, 17 Republicans would be needed to join them to reach the necessary two-thirds threshold.<br />The House impeached Mr. Trump last month on an article of inciting an insurrection in a 232-197 vote, with 10 Republicans joining all Democrats. So far, only six Senate Republicans have broken with their party to side with Democrats and against Mr. Trump on a key issue related to his defense: the constitutionality of trying a former president. With the Senate voting that the trial of a former president was constitutional, House managers and defense attorneys are squarely in the middle of a fight over the merits of the charge against Mr. Trump.<br />Lead impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.) and his fellow managers haven’t said what their next move is, but one option would be to use their remaining time to more fully connect the dots between Mr. Trump’s statements, tweets and speeches and the riot. So far, managers have aimed to show that Mr. Trump planned the attack by cultivating a base of people he knew to be violent, issuing a “save the date” notice through a Dec. 19 tweet calling for his supporters to “be there, will be wild,” and then timing his speech asserting that “you’ll never take back our country with weakness” to conclude just as Congress met in a joint session to certify President Biden’s Electoral College win.</td>

      <td>The global supply and demand of crude oil are on course to continue rebalancing this year after the turmoil brought by the pandemic in 2020, the International Energy Agency said Thursday.<br />Despite increasing its estimates for oil output in 2021, the IEA said in its monthly market report that a recovery in demand would outstrip production in the second half of the year, prompting “a rapid stock draw” of the glut of crude that has built up since the pandemic began.<br />The agency significantly increased its forecast for producing nations outside of the pact between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, raising its projections for non-OPEC supply growth by 290,000 barrels a day to an increase of 830,000 barrels a day this year.<br />At the same time, the IEA trimmed its forecast for global oil demand by 200,000 barrels a day to 96.4 million barrels—around 3% less than in 2019—but said part of that was because of a change to historic data.<br />Even so, with much of the developed world grappling with fresh Covid-19 variants and lockdown restrictions, a brightening economic outlook and strict supply discipline from OPEC-plus are hastening the drawdown in global oil inventories, the IEA said. It added that “the prospect of tighter markets ahead” has been responsible for a rally in oil prices in recent weeks.</td>

Investors far from Korea would be wise to monitor what the center-left administration decides: It could lay down a road map for other countries.<br />In the 12 months to Sept. 30, 21 of South Korea’s 50 largest companies by market capitalization recorded gross profit growth of more than 20%, compared with 10 companies in the same period a year earlier, according to Capital IQ data. And that isn’t unusual internationally. Tech companies, those plugged into the supply chain for electronics and some biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms boomed in 2020.<br />The advocates for profit-sharing or something like it have a stronger case than advocates of high corporate profit taxes: Much of the dispersion between the strong and weak performers over the past year has been down to luck rather than business ingenuity or astute management.<br />Among South Korea’s best-performing companies during the past year is  Seegene Inc.,  which recorded profit growth of more than 1,000% year-over-year in the third quarter. As a producer of diagnostic kits, it would have struggled to do poorly in the circumstances. On the other end of the scale,  Korean Air Lines Co.  has seen profits collapse. It would have been impossible to avert such a scenario for a passenger airline.<br />For now, the discussions are of a voluntary program in which large companies contribute to help struggling smaller firms. But even an optional plan could come with a spoonful of political and public-relations pressure.</td>

A day later, he apologized and retracted the remarks but said he wouldn’t step down.<br />Since then, a backlash, including criticism from the International Olympic Committee, the Japanese public, corporate sponsors and sports figures, has hit Mr. Mori hard and made him reconsider his position, the person close to him said.<br />Mr. Mori, who couldn’t be reached for comment, may announce his resignation at a meeting of the organizing committee’s executive board on Friday, called specifically to discuss his comments. A spokesman for the committee declined to comment. Several Japanese media organizations reported on Thursday that Mr. Mori had told the government of his intention to resign.<br />Mr. Mori’s successor is likely to be Saburo Kawabuchi, an 84-year-old former head of the Japan Football Association, according to the person familiar with the matter.</td>

She has been leading the handling of the hack fallout since day one of the Biden administration, said Emily Horne, an NSC spokeswoman. Officials didn't say why Ms. Neuberger’s role leading the response wasn’t disclosed sooner.<br />Ms. Neuberger is focused on directing federal agencies compromised in the hack toward specific remediation solutions and identifying issues in how the government has responded. She has also worked with the private sector on addressing the attack, which may include “potential executive actions underway,” Ms. Horne said, though she didn’t elaborate. Ms. Neuberger is also focused on launching a study of the SolarWinds breach to learn lessons and to prevent such incidents in the future, Ms. Horne said.<br />On Tuesday, Sens. Mark Warner and Marco Rubio, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to various federal cybersecurity leaders asking for the administration to “empower a clear leader in the United States’ response to the SolarWinds cyber breach that has affected numerous federal agencies.”<br />The senators also expressed agitation with the lack of details provided thus far to Congress about the hack, which current and former intelligence officials and private-sector cybersecurity experts have widely described as one of the worst hacks on record. The U.S. has blamed Russia for the hack. Moscow has denied involvement.</td>

The mix of migrants stayed largely steady from previous months, with single adults from Mexico accounting for most of the arrests, and families and unaccompanied children ticking up.<br />That continues a recent shift from the trend since 2014, when children and families from Central America, who are more likely to seek asylum, comprised the majority of migrants at the border.<br />The overall rise likely has several causes. Poverty and gang violence were exacerbated by a pair of hurricanes that hit Central America late last year, devastating the region’s economies. Mexico is suffering its worst economic slump in decades, prompting people to seek work across the border.<br />Authorities also said smugglers in the region have been telling migrants that President Biden’s administration, which has reversed many of the Trump administration’s strict immigration policies, would be more likely to allow them to stay in the U.S.</td>

      <td>House Democrats serving as impeachment managers made their case in the Senate on Wednesday</td>
      <td>Day two of the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump featured Democratic House impeachment managers making the first half of their case that he should be convicted for inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Here are five takeaways from the day:<br />Many senators, serving as jurors, appeared to be riveted and emotional as videos brought back the events of that day. House managers played audio of a terrified officer saying, “They have breached the scaffold, they are behind our lines.” They showed pro-Trump rioters bursting into the Capitol saying “stop the count,” converging at the threshold of the House floor with chants of “we want Trump,” and one rioter telling another who had called for no violence “it’s too late for that.” Another rioter could be heard calling out “Where are you Nancy?” and others could be heard chanting “Hang Mike Pence.” Managers played video of the fatal shooting of Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt as she tried to climb through a shattered window into the House lobby, and closed their predinner session by playing a single clip of Officer Daniel Hodges letting out a bone-chilling cry as rioters trapped him in between two doors, blood dripping from his mouth as he struggled to breathe.<br />House Democratic managers aimed to show that Mr. Trump planned the attack by cultivating a base of people he knew to be violent, issuing a “save the date” notice through a Dec. 19 tweet calling for his supporters to “be there, will be wild,” and then timing his speech asserting that “you’ll never take back our country with weakness” to conclude around 1 p.m.—just as Congress met in a joint session to certify President Biden’s Electoral College win. In the weeks before the attack, Mr. Trump’s supporters responded that “the cavalry is coming,” according to social-media posts that managers used to show rioters had been primed by months of Mr. Trump’s assertions that he would only lose if the election had been stolen.<br />Republicans said that despite the presentation, they weren’t convinced that Mr. Trump had caused the violence. “I don’t think it was inciting the riot,” said Sen. James Lankford (R., Okla.). Seventeen Republicans are needed to join 50 Democrats in convicting the president. With only a handful of GOP senators indicating they could vote to convict him, the question was whether any new Republicans would be moved. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican, did say that the managers had “done a good job connecting the dots.”<br />The managers personalized their arguments by showing the stakes faced by individual senators. One of the most compelling videos depicted Officer Eugene Goodman directing Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) to turn around and run in a different direction, away from a mob that was bearing down on the Capitol. Mr. Romney said he had remembered the encounter but hadn’t realized the officer was Mr. Goodman, and that it was the first time he had seen the video. After it played at trial, Mr. Romney could be seen talking to Mr. Goodman, where he said he expressed his appreciation to the officer and heard about Mr. Goodman’s trials on Jan. 6, including the nausea he felt after being subjected to tear gas and bear spray.</td>

Similar charges were also brought against two brothers from Montana who allegedly climbed through broken windows at the Capitol and forced their way to the Senate floor, and an alleged QAnon adherent from Iowa who was among the first rioters to enter the Capitol.<br />The law cited in the obstruction count falls under the broad witness-tampering statute and carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Many of the more than 200 people who face federal charges to date related to the Capitol riot were first arrested on criminal complaints that carried charges with lesser penalties. Prosecutors said they planned to seek indictments against most of the alleged rioters, and could add counts as the investigation progressed.<br />The brothers, Joshua and Jerod Hughes, and the Iowa man, Douglas Jensen, were allegedly part of a mob that chased Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman up a set of stairs close to the Senate chamber. That episode figured prominently in video footage shown by Democratic impeachment managers during Mr. Trump’s Senate trial on Wednesday.<br />Mr. Keller was first identified several days after the Capitol insurrection in widely circulated screenshots of video footage and photos taken inside the building. He stood out in the crowd for his height, 6-foot-6, and the navy blue jacket he wore bearing the seal of the U.S. Olympic Team. In addition to the obstruction charge, Mr. Keller faces counts of civil disorder, entering and engaging in disorderly conduct in a restricted building, and other counts. A lawyer for Mr. Keller declined to comment.</td>

      <td>BEIJING—About 90 people were hospitalized with Covid-19-like symptoms in central China in the two months before the disease was first identified in Wuhan in late 2019, according to World Health Organization investigators, who said they pressed Beijing to allow further testing to determine whether the new virus was spreading earlier than previously known.<br />Chinese authorities performed antibody tests on about two-thirds of those patients in the past few months, according to the investigators, and said they found no trace of infection by the virus. But members of the WHO team probing the pandemic’s origins said any antibodies could have subsided to undetectable levels during the delay.<br />“Further studies are needed,” said Peter Ben Embarek, the food-safety scientist who led the WHO team, which wrapped up a four-week visit to China on Wednesday.<br />Team members said they urged China to conduct wider tests on blood samples collected in autumn 2019 around Hubei, the province that is home to Wuhan, to look for evidence about when the virus was first circulating. Chinese authorities said they hadn’t yet obtained necessary permissions to test samples, many of which are held in blood banks, WHO investigators said.<br />China’s disclosures to the WHO raise questions about the possibility that Covid-19—which has now killed more than 2.3 million people—was already spreading in China as far back as October 2019 and that earlier detection could have helped contain the outbreak before it became a global pandemic. Beijing says the first patient identified in China developed symptoms on Dec. 8, 2019.</td>

      <td>Even a $130 billion bribe won’t get them back in the classroom this school year.</td>
      <td>President Biden made an early pandemic show by promising that a majority of American schools would reopen in his first 100 days in office. But on Tuesday we learned that this depends on the meaning of the word “reopen.”<br />“His goal that he set is to have the majority of schools, so more than 50 percent, open by day 100 of his presidency and that means some teaching in classrooms,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. “So at least one day a week.”<br />One day out of five? We doubt that’s how working parents define open.<br />Ms. Psaki is trying to make a virtue out of a humiliating political embarrassment. Mr. Biden figured that his support for the teachers union agenda, along with more money, would get the unions to reopen the schools. Instead he’s discovering what America’s parents have learned in the last year: Unions run the schools, and no one—not parents, not school districts, not mayors, and not even a new Democratic President—will tell them what to do. So it’s one day a week, pal. Get used to it.<br />This really is one of the great scandals of the pandemic. At first unions demanded that cases drop in their cities before schools open. Now cases are falling almost everywhere. So unions are insisting that teachers must be vaccinated before returning.</td>

      <td>He might be acquitted, but he won’t live down his disgraceful conduct.</td>
      <td>Whether a former President ought to be subject to an impeachment trial is a matter of constitutional debate. Whether it’s prudent, if acquittal appears likely, is a related question. But wherever you come down on those issues, the House impeachment managers this week are laying out a visceral case that the Capitol riot of Jan. 6 was a disgrace for which President Trump bears responsibility.<br />Long before November, Mr. Trump was saying that the only way he could lose the election was if it were rigged. On the night of the vote, he tweeted, “they are trying to STEAL the election.” In his speech that night, he called it “a fraud on the American public,” and said, “frankly we did win.” Is it a surprise that some of his fans took his words to heart?<br />Instead of bowing to dozens of court defeats, Mr. Trump escalated. He falsely claimed that Vice President Mike Pence, if only he had the courage, could reject electoral votes and stop Democrats from hijacking democracy. He called his supporters to attend a rally on Jan. 6, when Congress would do the counting. “Be there, will be wild!” Mr. Trump tweeted. His speech that day was timed to coincide with the action in the Capitol, and then he directed the crowd down Pennsylvania Avenue.<br />Mr. Trump’s defenders point out that he also told the audience to make their voices heard “peacefully.” And contra Rep. Eric Swalwell, who argued the incitement to attack the Capitol was “premeditated,” it’s difficult to think Mr. Trump ever envisioned what followed: that instead of merely making a boisterous display, the crowd would riot, assault the police, invade the building, send lawmakers fleeing with gas masks, trash legislative offices, and leave in its wake a dead Capitol officer.<br />But talk about playing with fire. Mr. Trump told an apocalyptic fable in which American democracy might end on Jan. 6, and some people who believed him acted like it. Once the riot began, Mr. Trump took hours to say anything, a delay his defenders have not satisfactorily explained. Even then he equivocated. Imagine, Rep. Joe Neguse said, if Mr. Trump “had simply gone onto TV, just logged on to  Twitter  and said ‘Stop the Attack,’ if he had done so with even half as much force as he said ‘Stop the Steal.’”</td>

      <td>Biden is rethinking Trump’s reckless May 1 withdrawal.</td>
      <td>October will mark 20 years since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan to eliminate al Qaeda sanctuaries and its Taliban sponsors, and Americans are understandably eager to move on. But the difficulties that come with America’s current commitment are nothing compared with the chaos that would follow an abrupt departure.<br />In February 2020 the Trump Administration and Taliban signed a withdrawal agreement that requires all U.S. troops to leave by May 1, 2021. The move was driven by Donald Trump’s domestic political instincts—not a strategic calculation. President Biden is wisely reviewing that decision.<br />“I’m very pleased with what the Biden Administration is proposing for Afghanistan,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican, said on Sunday. “They’re re-evaluating our presence in Afghanistan to keep the footprint low, but not to walk away and lose all the gains we’ve achieved.” The White House hasn’t announced a final decision, but Mr. Graham expects the U.S. to remain beyond May.<br />Many Democrats and isolationist-leaning Republicans get attention for their calls to end “forever wars” immediately. But Mr. Graham’s comments are a reminder that there’s also broad support for a more careful approach. The question is not whether the U.S. will leave Afghanistan but whether it will do so responsibly.<br />The bipartisan Afghanistan Study Group has made a persuasive case for how to do that in its report to Congress this month. The group—former generals, Senators, ambassadors and national-security officials—suggests replacing Mr. Trump’s timeline with a conditions-based approach. “A withdrawal would not only leave America more vulnerable to terrorist threats,” the report says, “it would also have catastrophic effects in Afghanistan and the region that would not be in the interest of any of the key actors, including the Taliban.”</td>

      <td>The Biden spending bill will have governors swimming in cash.</td>
      <td>Governors—especially from Democratic states—have been pleading revenue poverty since the pandemic began. But as we approach the anniversary of Covid-19 in America, that tall tale is becoming more difficult to sell.<br />Even the left-tilting media are beginning to figure out what we’ve been reporting for some time. One of our sources is Dan Clifton, of Strategas Research Partners, who has been tracking state revenue trends and Covid relief from the beginning. His latest analysis shows that state revenues have been doing far better than advertised, especially states that have kept their economies largely open.<br />He estimates that a majority of the 50 states are seeing revenues arrive above their pre-Covid levels despite the 2020 economic damage. The big exceptions are states that had the most restrictive business lockdowns (New York), those that rely on sales taxes and have no income tax (Florida and Texas), and those that depend on travel and tourism (Nevada).<br />Add the $350 billion windfall that will soon flow to state and local governments from the $1.9 trillion Biden relief bill, and the states will be swimming in cash. Mr. Clifton projects that the states overall will have a combined budget surplus. The federal aid formula would provide an average of 20% of all state tax revenue.<br />California already has tax revenue coming in above its pre-pandemic level, thanks to a buoyant stock market and capital gains. But it will receive another $27 billion from federal taxpayers, or 17% of the state’s entire general fund revenue. Pennsylvania will receive $7.1 billion, or 20% of its tax revenue.</td>

      <td>He was a Marine, an economist, a diplomat, a patriot and a statesman. He was also my friend.</td>
      <td>George Shultz came into my life some 50 years ago and never left it. He was secretary of labor, but President Nixon asked him to study the trend in oil prices because before coming into government George had been an economist at the University of Chicago and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I was Nixon’s national security adviser and George called on me to discuss a conclusion he thought might affect my policy portfolio. The price of oil was then around $3.35 a barrel, but George warned me that U.S. production was projected to fall considerably; a greater reliance on imports was therefore inevitable. The price of oil would rise—perhaps precipitously. The bargaining power of foreign oil producers would skyrocket. Events proved George right.<br />His career in government continued as director of the Office of Management and Budget and Treasury secretary. His calm demeanor made him influential in interagency discussions. Colleagues knew that when he raised issues, it was out of deep concern. Never seeking personal advancement, always expressing sincere convictions, George invariably became a driving force on every committee. Our relationship evolved from association to partnership, and then to a friendship that lasted for the rest of our lives.<br />After the Nixon years, he served as president of the Bechtel Corp. before returning to government as secretary of state in the Reagan administration. In that capacity he built a cooperative relationship with China and greatly expanded cultural and economic relations. Contrary to today’s revisionist narrative, the U.S.-China relationship at that time was based on specific, shared strategic benefits. With his Soviet counterpart, George negotiated the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the only Cold War agreement that eliminated a category of nuclear weapons. The crowning achievement of George’s diplomacy was to see the Cold War to a peaceful conclusion.<br />For all his proximity to presidents and important roles, George was never seduced by the trappings of power. “It’s a great mistake to want the job too much, because then you do things to keep the job that you probably wouldn’t do otherwise,” he once said. His equanimity was not contrived; outer composure reflected an inner serenity.<br />In the last two decades of George’s life, the control of nuclear weapons became his chief preoccupation. He approached nuclear arms control the same way he tackled every other issue of public importance—by engaging in deep study, assembling the best group of advisers, and then making deliberate contributions to the public debate, often in these pages.</td>

      <td>As in 2009, jamming big spending through may cost Democrats in the next midterms.</td>
      <td>Perhaps he didn’t mean it after all.<br />When President Joe Biden said in his inaugural address that “my whole soul is in this: bringing America together, uniting our people and uniting our nation,” it may have been a song and dance for people hungry for leaders who would search for common ground.<br />When Mr. Biden met with Republican senators to discuss Covid relief, it may have been for show. From the back of the room, Ron Klain, the president’s chief of staff, shook his head vigorously in disagreement when Republicans raised issues, apparently signaling to the president how to react.<br />So when White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed afterward that Mr. Biden “welcomes the opportunity to work” with Republicans, it was, to use a favorite word of her boss, malarkey.<br />How do we know Team Biden’s stated desire for bipartisanship is folderol? Because the administration made no serious effort to consider GOP proposals. Instead, it quickly gave congressional Republicans the back of its hand by complaining publicly they weren’t mounting “a serious negotiating effort.” For this White House, the loyal opposition must fall in line—no compromise, only capitulation.</td>

      <td>Better than culture-war strife would be readings and conversations guided by wise professors. Is such a thing still possible on campuses today?</td>
      <td>When the Association for Asian American Studies voted in 2013 to become the first academic group to demand a cultural and economic boycott of Israel, not a single member opposed the resolution at the organization’s annual conference. This unanimity surprised Jonathan Marks because, as he puts it, professors “are nothing if not quarrelsome and contentious.” Mr. Marks published an open letter describing “the complete absence of dissent [as] a sign of disciplinary ill health.” He urged skeptics from within the group to break their silence.<br />“It has been seven years, and not one blog post or op-ed has surfaced,” reports Mr. Marks in “Let’s Be Reasonable,” an engaging apologia for liberal education from the perspective of “that rare beast, the conservative professor.” Rather than ranting against institutions that have turned his kind into an endangered species, Mr. Marks, who teaches politics at Ursinus College in Pennsylvania, blends humor with argument as he makes his case for a renewed vision of higher learning. What he proposes is attractive in its fundamentals, and certainly persuasive, but also perhaps too hopeful about the prospects for reform.<br />The anecdote about the Association for Asian American Studies would seem to provide more proof that progressives have turned yet another precinct of academia into a one-party state of left-wing dogma. Mr. Marks, however, insists that “the present is not as bad a time as the shouting of culture warriors and the lectures of consultants might lead us despairingly to believe.” When anti-Zionist activism arrived on his campus, for example, Mr. Marks enlisted “a colleague with whom I’d butted heads” to form discussion groups with students. They agreed to look at “the same evidence together and hold each other’s arguments up to scrutiny.” These efforts apparently reduced tensions. They also filled Mr. Marks with optimism: “I think the overwhelming majority of university people—students, faculty, staff—agree, most of the time, that rational inquiry is fruitful, even honorable.”<br />The lesson for Mr. Marks is that his fellow conservatives should stop disparaging colleges and universities and strive to salvage them. He notes that “The Closing of the American Mind,” the 1987 book by Allan Bloom, his former teacher at the University of Chicago and a hero to many conservatives, “was full of love for universities” even as it faulted them for becoming factories of moral relativism. Mr. Marks describes “God and Man at Yale,” the 1951 book by William F. Buckley Jr. that accused the professoriate of embracing socialism and secularism, as belonging to the same tradition. Today, by contrast, conservatism is done with the “lovers’ quarrel” that characterized its earlier critiques of the university. Now it’s “in the midst of a bitter divorce, and more inclined to murder its ex than to try to win her back.”<br />“Let’s Be Reasonable” isn’t a sequel to the books by Bloom and Buckley, but it’s written in much the same spirit, and its best quality is its thoughtful defense of liberal education. At a time when many people view colleges and universities as nothing more than “career development offices with classrooms attached,” Mr. Marks imagines something else: “The highest aim of liberal education is not a set of skills but a kind of person.” He recommends readings and conversations guided by wise professors who seek to help students “answer the question of what we are and what the best way of life is.”</td>

      <td>I never thought the old saying “Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth” applied to me, since until last year I never received unexpected gifts. But now my wife and I find ourselves looking into the mouth of a “gift horse”—stimulus checks. To be precise, there were no checks; $2,400 and then $1,200 were deposited directly into our checking account. Apparently we’re going to get another $2,800.<br />Free money—wow! But we don’t want it. We don’t need it. The program is popular. According to a recent poll, nearly 8 of 10 Americans approve of giving out payments of $1,400. The trouble is that plenty of the people who qualify do fine without the handout.<br />We do because we have an adjusted gross income of $78,000, from Social Security and three small pensions. Our expenses are low. Our mortgage, $1,500 a month, is almost paid off. Our two adult children support themselves. Our seven-year-old car is paid for. My wife rarely drinks; I have one beer a day, which costs around $10 a week.<br />We can’t afford to take luxury cruises or go often to expensive restaurants, but we can travel to Europe every other year and rent a beach house for a week every summer.<br />“Anyone who lives within his means suffers from a lack of imagination,” the actor Lionel Stander observed. For many years we lived beyond our means, traveling frequently as we supported our daughters’ college education. But in the past 15 years we’ve had no credit-card debt. Most important, we have a superb medical plan. We rarely have copayments. We also have good dental insurance.</td>

      <td>Fed chairman also says monetary policy alone won’t be enough to restore the labor market to full strength</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve will continue bolstering the U.S. economy through low interest rates and hefty asset purchases, Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday, stressing that the labor market remains stunted by the pandemic.<br />The Fed is unlikely to “even think about withdrawing policy support” by raising rates or reducing its bond purchases for the foreseeable future, Mr. Powell said at a virtual appearance before the Economic Club of New York.<br />The Fed chief also repeated his call for more fiscal assistance for the economy, saying that monetary policy alone won’t be enough to restore the labor market to full strength. “It will require a society-wide commitment, with contributions from across government and the private sector,” Mr. Powell said.<br />“Workers and households who struggle to find their place in the post-pandemic economy are likely to need continued support,” he said. “The same is true for many small businesses that are likely to prosper again once the pandemic is behind us.”<br />The U.S. economy shrank 3.5% last year, its largest yearly contraction since just after World War II, the Commerce Department reported. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 6.3% in January from 6.7% a month earlier, the Labor Department said Friday. That compares with a 3.5% unemployment rate in February 2020, before the pandemic struck.</td>

      <td>A decision on case, argued in November, is pending before the high court</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration told the Supreme Court that the Affordable Care Act remains constitutional, reversing the Trump Justice Department’s position that the entire health-care overhaul was void because Congress reduced to zero the penalty for failing to carry insurance.<br />“Following the change in Administration, the Department of Justice has reconsidered the government’s position,” Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler said in a two-page letter to the justices Wednesday on the pending case.<br />The move was expected, as President Biden campaigned on expanding Obamacare along with a more vigorous federal response to the coronavirus pandemic. Former President Trump throughout his term denounced to the signature law of the Obama administration, although he never proposed any alternative healthcare program after the Republican-controlled Congress rejected legislation to repeal the measure.<br />Texas’s Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, sued to strike down the Affordable Care Act after Congress in 2017 reduced the penalty to zero. With Trump administration backing, he argued the law no longer was constitutional because it no longer generated revenue for the U.S. Treasury. The argument extrapolated from the 2012 Supreme Court decision upholding the law, which required most individuals to carry health insurance or pay a penalty along with their income taxes, under Congress’ authority to levy taxes.<br />The 2012 decision found that the insurance mandate effectively offered individuals a choice of paying a tax or carrying insurance, rather than a dictate to purchase a product against their will.</td>

A Saudi terrorism court in a secretive trial sentenced Ms. Hathloul in December to nearly six years in prison on charges of incitement against the regime and serving a foreign agenda.<br />She was released Wednesday on three years’ probation, with a five-year travel ban, after a reduction for time served. “She is not free. The fight is not over,” her sister tweeted.<br />Mr. Biden, speaking at the Pentagon, said Ms. Hathloul’s release was welcome news: “She is a powerful advocate for women’s rights, and releasing her was the right thing to do.”</td>

      <td><br /><br /><br />Sia Furler’s life in music has followed a strange and winding path. The Australian-born artist, now age 45, spent the 1990s and early ’00s in relative obscurity, playing with a few bands, landing the occasional guest vocal, and releasing a handful of solo records as simply Sia. Back then, much of her own work was loose and jazzy folk-pop, including “Breathe Me,” which in 2005 memorably provided the soundtrack for the closing scene from the acclaimed HBO series “Six Feet Under.” Later in that decade, she began writing for other singers and turned out to be very good at it. She topped the charts as a songwriter with Rihanna’s 2012 smash “Diamonds” and used that momentum to reboot her solo career. Her own hits, and those she’s written for others, represent an influential approach to pop craftsmanship, one in which hugely catchy melodic phrases are married to uplifting lyrics to generate anthems about empowerment.<br />Ms. Furler’s success as a songwriter has afforded her an opportunity to work in other mediums. “Music” (Atlantic / Monkey Puzzle), her ninth studio album, out Friday, is a companion to a film of the same name that she co-wrote and directed. It stars Kate Hudson, Leslie Odom Jr. and dancer Maddie Ziegler, who has appeared in many of Ms. Furler’s music videos, in a story about a child on the autism spectrum named Music. Following her grandmother’s death, the girl, played by Ms. Ziegler, is suddenly thrust into the care of her troubled sister (Ms. Hudson), a former drug dealer who is herself struggling to survive. (The movie has drawn fire for being insensitive in its handling of autism, and also in its casting, with some activists suggesting the title role should have gone to an actor with the condition.) The drama unfolds alongside elaborately staged fantasy sequences representing Music’s internal life.</td>

      <td>Best Buy Co.  notified workers this week that it was cutting some jobs at its big box stores, according to people familiar with the situation, as the retailer adapts to a world where more shopping happens online.<br />The company has reported skyrocketing sales in recent quarters as pandemic-weary shoppers stock up on appliances, videogame systems and other electronics. Comparable sales, those from websites or stores operating for at least 12 months, rose 23% in the quarter ended Oct. 31. Much of the gains came from online orders, which nearly tripled in the U.S. in the last quarter.<br />A spokesman for the company declined to comment on the details of the job cuts. “As we have said before, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital,” said the spokesman. “Our workforce will need to evolve to meet the evolving needs of customers while providing more flexible opportunities for our people.”<br />The company had 125,000 full-time and part-time workers as of January 2020. Best Buy furloughed about 51,000 of its workers early in April, including nearly all its part-time employees, as it closed most of its stores early in the pandemic to all but curbside pickup. In June, Best Buy began bringing back furloughed workers and in August raised its starting wage to $15 an hour.<br />After reporting strong third-quarter sales, executives said in November that the outlook was uncertain for the rest of the year. The company said it would resume share repurchases in the fourth quarter and close all its stores in Mexico, its smallest market. The company reports full year earnings Feb. 25.</td>

      <td>The administration aims to have more than 50% of schools open at least one day a week in its first 100 days, a bar Republicans call too low</td>
      <td>After President Biden made an ambitious promise to help reopen a majority of K-8 schools in his first 100 days, the White House said this week the pledge means opening more than 50% of schools for in-person teaching at least one day a week.<br />The comments drew criticism from Republicans and some parents, amid growing debate over how to define opening schools. The fresh tension comes as many districts around the country remain in virtual mode amid the winter jump in Covid-19 cases and deaths, the spread of new coronavirus strains, the slow vaccination rollout and clashes between state authorities and teachers’ unions.<br />White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that the goal was “at least one day a week in the majority of schools, by day 100.” On Wednesday she stressed that this was “not the ceiling, that is the bar we’re trying to leap over and exceed.”<br />“Certainly, we are not planning to celebrate at 100 days if we reach that goal. That is our own effort to set our own markings, set a bold and ambitious agenda for how we’re going to measure ourselves and progress,” she said. “But we certainly hope to build from that, even at 100 days.”<br />Several congressional Republicans criticized that goal on Wednesday. “The Biden Administration’s stated goal of reopening 50% of classrooms for one day a week is unacceptable. Our students deserve more,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said on Twitter.</td>

      <td>Iranian breaches of the 2015 nuclear deal raise fears that the country is paving the way to start work on nuclear weapons, raising pressure on President Biden</td>
      <td>Iran has in recent months repeatedly violated the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, reducing the time it would need to produce a nuclear weapon. The violations, a response to U.S. sanctions imposed after former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact in 2018, have put at risk the survival of an agreement that helped remove sanctions on Iran and open it to business with the West.<br />The latest development was revealed on Feb. 10 when the International Atomic Energy Agency told member states in a confidential report that Iran had begun producing uranium metal, a material vital for nuclear weapons. Iran had told the agency in mid-December that it planned to produce uranium metal, but that production would require four to five months to install the equipment to produce the powder from which uranium metal is made. Iran has said it would produce uranium metal for civilian purposes, though the uranium metal produced this month might not be related to this work.<br />In January, Iran made one of its biggest steps yet to breach the 2015 deal, announcing it had begun enriching uranium at 20% purity. That crossed a red line previously set by European powers that are still party to the accord.<br />The most recent disclosure of uranium metal production—which has limited civilian utility—has stirred concern among Western officials over whether Iran is preparing to restart work toward a nuclear weapon.<br />Uranium metal is often used in the core of nuclear weapons. Production of the material is a clear breach of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers, in which it agreed to a 15-year moratorium on uranium and plutonium metallurgical production.</td>

      <td>Data indicates investors will have to wait longer for increase in consumer prices that many have been expecting</td>
      <td>U.S. government-bond prices climbed Wednesday after soft inflation data indicated that investors will have to wait longer for the big increase in consumer prices that many have been expecting this year.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 1.133%, according to Tradeweb, down from 1.174% before the data was released and 1.156% Tuesday.<br />Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, dropped after the Labor Department said core consumer prices, excluding the often volatile food and energy categories, remained unchanged in January compared with the previous month. Core prices were also flat in December after a downward revision to the earlier estimate.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.1% increase in core prices in January.<br />Overall, the data indicates that “there’s just no real significant underlying inflationary pressure,” said Thomas Simons, senior vice president and money-market economist in the fixed-income group at Jefferies LLC.</td>

It shows the money raised by each U.S. IPO and each SPAC since the start of 2019, as tracked by Dealogic.<br />Some high-profile SPACs, such as those that later merged with Nikola and Virgin Galactic, don’t appear below because the blank-check companies involved went public before 2019.<br />Many of these SPACs have yet to identify a merger target, as indicated by those in pale green.<br /></td>

      <td>Ride-hailing giant’s annual loss narrows even as health crisis weighs on core operations</td>
      <td>Uber Technologies Inc.  posted a narrower annual loss on the back of its food-delivery business and aggressive cost cuts, even as the coronavirus pandemic crushed its core ride-hailing operations.<br />The San Francisco-based company on Wednesday reported a net loss of $6.76 billion for 2020, compared with a loss of $8.5 billion the year before. While widespread shelter-in-place orders crippled Uber’s rides business, its food-delivery arm thrived as the same mandates kept people from going to restaurants. Revenue for the year declined 14% to $11.13 billion.<br />Uber overhauled its business during the health crisis, cutting a quarter of its staff and shedding noncore businesses, among other moves, leading to $1 billion in savings on fixed expenses last year.<br />The company’s fourth-quarter revenue declined 16% to $3.16 billion. The net loss for the period narrowed to $968 million from $1.09 billion in the year-earlier quarter.<br />Uber’s adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization also narrowed in the latest quarter to $454 million, compared with a loss of $615 million a year earlier. Uber has said it expects to become profitable by this measure by the end of this year.</td>
