Last month, he changed his Twitter biography to “#bitcoin,” a move that sent prices for it higher. His tweets about dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that was started in 2013 as a joke, also made that virtual currency much more valuable.</td>

      <td>What Tom Brady’s done is absurd. His career was absurd before this, of course, mocking the standard trajectory for a football quarterback, but the absurdity has truly become something to behold.<br />He’s really gone and done it now. The Brady reverence was suffocating in the weeks heading into this Super Bowl, and it will be even more suffocating now that he’s done it, won Super Bowl No. 7, with a new team, in a new city, in a new conference, after leaving Bill Belichick and a Patriots dynasty…and even still, I wonder if we’re moderately underselling it, how amazing it is, what he’s accomplished, at the defiant age of 43.<br />With Tampa Bay, Brady’s added a deeply personal chapter.<br />To win and win throughout your career, but to do it in the same shop, repeatedly, a bit mechanically, to the point that people start to wonder if it’s more about the shop, and less about you, and then to leave, bittersweetly, for another shop, a new coach, and a whole fresh set of co-workers, and win it again, right away?<br />Brady is not the type of athlete to publicly parse his emotions, but it’s got to be one of the most satisfying feelings in sports.</td>

      <td>U.S. auto dealers selling Chrysler, Dodge,  Fiat  and other brands under the recently formed auto-making giant  Stellantis  NV have a message for the new leadership: Help us fix the ailing parts of the lineup or consider cutting back.<br />For years, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, the car company that recently merged with Peugeot-maker PSA Group to create Stellantis, has operated seven vehicle brands in the U.S.—more than many of its closest rivals. While some marques like Jeep and Ram have thrived, others have withered in recent years, dinged by a lack of new investment, aging models and sluggish sales, analysts and dealers say.<br />The question of how to revive Fiat Chrysler’s weaker brands has lingered for years, and it now falls to Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares to answer it. Mr. Taveres has said he doesn’t plan to cut any brands, and a Stellantis spokesman added that the company values its diverse lineup of brands, ranging from off-roaders at Jeep to family-haulers at Chrysler.<br />Chrysler, a nearly 100-year-old badge that once was the company’s namesake, now sells three models—two minivans and a large sedan—about half the number of nameplates it sold in showrooms a decade ago. Its U.S. sales have steadily slid: last year it sold roughly 110,500 vehicles, about one-third its volume in 2015, according to company figures.<br />Fiat, a maker of small cars reintroduced to the U.S. in 2011, has also struggled with a limited lineup, quality woes and a sharp drop-off in sales.</td>

A Federal Bureau of Investigation field office reported a rallying call for war and the sharing of maps of the Capitol. The Department of Homeland Security warned about the heightened potential for violence in the rally’s run-up, though mentioned no specific threat for Jan. 6.<br />While the information was shared, this multipoint warning system broke down, failing to generate sufficient follow-up, as officials spotted and dismissed these signals while missing others entirely, according to interviews with current and former officials and a review of internal government documents.<br />The result: The extensive local and federal law-enforcement network that protects Washington was never fully prepared, leaving the usually heavily guarded city center vulnerable to attack. That assault came Jan. 6 when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol as Congress was preparing to certify President Biden’s election victory.<br />“Nothing significant to report,” read a Jan. 5 national summary from DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis that was sent to law enforcement across the country, according to a copy reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The office is responsible for monitoring threats online and sharing them with federal, state and local law enforcement.</td>

      <td>The tech stock frenzy has lifted many of SoftBank’s investments, but a market reversal would hit the company hard</td>
      <td>Japan’s  SoftBank ,  a big investor in technology companies, has certainly regained its confidence after a humbling 2019. Whether that confidence persists through the next market downturn is another question.<br />SoftBank’s founder Masayoshi Son is clearly upbeat. During Monday’s earnings briefing for the quarter ending in December, he compared SoftBank to a producer of golden eggs. It is surely producing a few lately. Food-delivery company  DoorDash netted $8.3 billion for SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund after an initial public offering in December was well-received. The 40% rise in Uber’s share price last quarter also pushed up the fund’s paper profits in the ride-hailing giant to $3.6 billion. And SoftBank is in the process of selling chip designer Arm to rival  Nvidia .  The Japanese company booked ¥1.77 trillion of investment gains last quarter, equivalent to $16.7 billion, mostly from the Vision Fund and its $10 billion successor.<br />Even WeWork, the office-sharing company that produced spectacular losses for SoftBank in 2019, may finally be turning a corner. The company is in talks to come to public markets to combine with a special-purpose acquisition company, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. Buoyant stocks mean SoftBank may keep listing some of its investments at high valuations, bringing additional windfalls.<br />SoftBank’s net asset value, however, fell by $37 billion last quarter: mostly because of the troubles of the company’s biggest investment, Alibaba. The Chinese e-commerce giant’s stock fell 21% in the quarter as the company was embroiled in antitrust investigations.<br />SoftBank’s share price nonetheless has continued to go up: it is now just 6% off its all-time high during the dot-com boom. SoftBank’s asset sales and buybacks last year helped narrow the discount of its market value to its net asset value.</td>

Car makers are first using available chips for their most profitable and bestselling models, and analysts predict that the effects will linger until March. Many global brands will be more affected than local Chinese brands, Fitch Ratings analysts said.</td>

Those topics have been at the center of disputes between Amazon and its workforce sprawled across hundreds of facilities. Some employees have complained about what they say is a grueling workload and how the company monitors employees through an internal tracking system and cameras.<br />Amazon, which is on pace—based on recent hiring trends—to overtake  Walmart Inc.  within the next few years, has said that it offers some of the best pay and benefits available for comparable jobs in similar industries, and that the company provides a competitive compensation package that includes 401(k) and health-care coverage.<br />Here is what you need to know about the coming vote:</td>

      <td>U.S. energy companies are getting into carbon capture in time to help their reputations and their bottom lines</td>
      <td>All the cool kids are doing carbon capture.<br />Exxon Mobil  is the latest to embrace the trend, announcing on Feb. 1 that it has formed a new business unit to commercialize its low-carbon technology portfolio, mostly comprising carbon capture and storage. The move comes on the heels of reports that a pair of activist investors are pushing the company for changes. One of those, Engine No. 1 LLC, reportedly is planning a proxy fight for board seats.<br />Exxon’s timing fits a pattern.  Occidental Petroleum  launched its low-carbon business—dubbed Oxy Low Carbon Ventures—in 2018, a year after shareholders pressured it to assess the long-term climate impacts of its business. As the industry faces questions—both from its own investors and from governments—about its role in the energy transition, many in the oil-and-gas sector have announced some form of investment in the technology, however small the dollar amount.<br />Both Exxon and Occidental’s moves followed shareholder pressure, but they are timely for other reasons, too: The stars are aligning just so on the policy front.<br />The oil-and-gas industry has in fact been using carbon capture well before global warming became a concern, mainly to produce even more hydrocarbons. Since the 1920s, the industry has used it to sift out unprofitable carbon dioxide that naturally occurs in natural-gas reservoirs from valuable methane. Starting in the 1970s, drillers began using it to squeeze more oil out of reservoirs.</td>

      <td>Some economists think a $1.9 trillion stimulus package could overheat the economy, but the bond market seems to disagree</td>
      <td>Some prominent U.S. economists believe that the Biden administration’s proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package is so large that it could overheat the economy. But the bond market seems to be in total disagreement, as are global financial markets generally.<br />Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and former International Monetary Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard both recently suggested that the Biden administration risks overheating the economy. Mr. Blanchard suggested on Twitter that the program could lead to “not the 2.5% [inflation] that some predict, but potentially a lot more,” prompting “a very large increase in interest rates.”<br />Supporters of the argument might point to rising bond yields. At around 1.19%, the 10-year Treasury yield is at its highest level since early March. Inflation pricing in the bond market is back to levels last seen in 2014.<br />But those are levels that suggest a recovery, not an inflationary burnout. The U.S. yield curve still bears far more similarity to last summer’s depressed levels than its immediate post-2008 crisis steep slope.<br />If Mr. Summers and Mr. Blanchard are correct, then that entire lower-for-longer post-2008 paradigm would be at an end. Pushing long-end U.S. bond yields simply back to where they were at the end of 2010 would mean a tectonic shift—a once-in-a-generation money-making opportunity for bond bears, before even considering the effect on credit markets or equities.</td>

      <td>From 2015 to 2017, as the Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co. collected stakes in overseas hotels, financial institutions and office towers in a $40 billion deal-making frenzy, a question lingered: How did the company get so much money to spend?<br />Now, following the downfall of one of China’s most acquisitive companies, the findings of a provincial government working group are shedding some light on the unorthodox ways that money was moved around within HNA, which has a sprawling web of more than 2,000 subsidiaries, affiliates and shell companies.<br />Three publicly listed companies controlled by HNA, including its flagship carrier  Hainan Airlines ,  said in late January that billions of dollars were misappropriated from their businesses and that their coffers were drained by HNA’s activities. The three firms said their assets were also used to guarantee debts of HNA and its related entities.<br />An HNA spokeswoman declined to comment.<br />The recent disclosures are just the tip of the iceberg. HNA creditors, which include state-owned financial firms, have asked a court in Hainan to reorganize the company and disentangle the many complex financing arrangements that once powered its aggressive global expansion. HNA, which was sunk by massive debt, said it would submit to the legal process.</td>

      <td>Chief of the social network whose users sparked GameStop stock-trading frenzy expresses confidence in its user-reliant model for policing speech</td>
      <td>Reddit Inc.’s role in the recent stock-trading frenzy has brought millions of new users to the social-media platform, its chief executive says, as well as scrutiny to the power of large communities online.<br />One of Reddit’s defining quirks is that it largely relies on users, instead of algorithms or armies of tech employees, to police speech. Those community moderators didn’t intervene when users in a forum called WallStreetBets egged on people to buy shares of heavily shorted stocks such as  GameStop Corp.  U.S. regulators are now probing whether the ensuing market upheaval resulted in securities-law violations.<br />In an interview, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the WallStreetBets episode has demonstrated the durability of the company’s model, as it matures and grows. The 37-year-old Reddit co-founder recently changed his Reddit profile image to WallStreetBets’ cartoonish mascot of a Wall Street trader with so-called diamond hands, in a show of support for the group.<br />“This whole event is showing the power of large communities of everyday people,” said Mr. Huffman. “Not just massive institutional and professional investors get to participate in the stock market.”<br />The action on Reddit has helped the company land new advertisers—its main source revenue—and bring back lapsed ones, including those who recently paused spending in the market melee, Mr. Huffman said. The most recent user numbers from Reddit, which isn’t profitable, put the daily average at 52 million as of October. “We’re still proving ourselves to advertisers,” he said. The company paid for a five-second commercial that aired Sunday for Super Bowl LV.</td>

      <td>When Robinhood Markets Inc. and other brokers abruptly restricted trading in  GameStop Corp. , it cast a spotlight on a normally obscure corner of the financial markets: the clearinghouse that processes U.S. stock trades.<br />Robinhood’s move infuriated its customers, prompted dozens of lawsuits against the Menlo Park, Calif.-based startup and will be scrutinized in a hearing on Capitol Hill next week. Initially, many investors assumed the firm’s decision to limit buying GameStop shares was directed by hedge funds that had bet against the stock or by high-frequency trading firms. In fact, the move was prompted by something more mundane—a $3 billion margin call from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.<br />Robinhood and others are now calling for a modernization of the way DTCC processes nearly $1.7 trillion of securities trades each day to help prevent such an occurrence from repeating.<br />The DTCC is responsible for clearing and settling U.S. stock trades. In other words, after every trade, it ensures that the shares are delivered to the buyer and cash is delivered to the seller, a process that takes two business days.<br />To protect against the risk that a buyer or seller will default during those two days, a DTCC subsidiary known as the National Securities Clearing Corp. maintains a multibillion-dollar fund to be tapped in case of such a failure. The fund is maintained by deposits from brokerages including units of many Wall Street banks as well as  Charles Schwab Corp.  and Robinhood.</td>

At Enel’s rate, if it borrowed $100 for a year, it would pay back $99.39.<br />For the lender, in this case the money-market funds that buy commercial paper, the opposite is true.

Other companies recently targeted by individual investors online, such as AMC and  BlackBerry ,  also deflated. The Treasury Department concluded on Thursday that “the core [market] infrastructure was resilient.”<br />The real political fallout, though, may be to come. Officials are investigating financial misconduct, particularly by brokerage firms that restricted purchases of some stocks last week. Politicians on both sides of the aisle lamented that professional speculators were protected at the expense of small traders. Brokers said they only took action because of risk limits imposed by clearing firms.<br />An explicit goal of Reddit gamblers was to torpedo hedge funds’ short bets, which they see as fraudulent manipulation by a Wall Street cabal. Yet trades by the Reddit gang also ended up benefiting many asset managers, including hedge funds.<br />But focusing on whether amateur or professional investors won or lost more in the GameStop saga risks missing the point.

Nearly 80% of the investment gains were due to strong performance at Vision Funds 1 and 2.<br />Anticipation of strong results pushed SoftBank’s stock price up 4.4% to ¥9,485 Monday—a level last seen in February 2000, when the company’s shares peaked during the internet bubble.<br />“We’ve finally entered the harvest phase” for the Vision Fund, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said at a Tokyo news conference, standing in front of a slide showing a goose laying towering columns of golden eggs that represented SoftBank’s investment hits.<br />The results highlight how much the boom in public markets over the last several months has benefited SoftBank, which during the past year completed its metamorphosis into an investment holding company from a telecommunications conglomerate. Climbing share prices last year helped SoftBank claw its way back into the black from a multibillion-dollar loss.</td>

But he kept his night-owlishness to himself for about three months.<br />“Even if I was working late, I wouldn’t communicate that per se,” he says. He believes a stigma exists against late risers that can affect their professional standing. “But once I gained the trust of my manager, I was allowed to be more flexible.” Now he openly burns the midnight oil and doesn’t worry if his colleagues know.<br />In our age of remote work, many jobs have never been so untethered from the 9-to-5 paradigm. And a lot of night owls, who do their best work later in the day, are thriving.<br />But it’s not quite a 24/7 free-for-all. Many newly liberated late workers like Mr. Gang are navigating how to balance their habits with bosses and colleagues who work on more traditional daytime schedules.

He was 100 years old.<br />Mr. Shultz held four different cabinet posts in the Nixon and Reagan administrations and served for six years as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, one of the longest such tenures since World War II. He remained an active voice on national security, economic and environmental issues after leaving government, sometimes taking positions challenging the Trump administration.<br />A man of strong convictions who nevertheless rarely lost control of his emotions, Mr. Shultz played a pivotal role in encouraging Mr. Reagan to pursue a dialogue with the Soviet Union’s leaders despite strong opposition from the Pentagon and, at times, the president’s own national-security adviser.<br />“I always thought of Shultz as a stabilizer,” said John Lewis Gaddis, a Yale University professor and Cold War historian. “If you think of great ships going across the ocean, the captain sets the course, but somebody has to keep it on course.”<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken described Mr. Shultz as a champion of diplomacy who came to his post with enormous experience. “Every Secretary of State who came after George Shultz has studied him—his work, his judgment, his intellect. I know I have,” Mr. Blinken said. “It’s as distinguished a record of public service as any in American history.”</td>

      <td>Yield-hungry investors have been piling into riskier assets, and not only speculative stocks like  GameStop .  For an example of how negative real interest rates are distorting prices, behold the municipal bond market.<br />Last month investors snapped up $560 million in bonds issued by junk-rated Chicago Public Schools (CPS). The district’s 10-year bonds were priced at 1.94% and the 20-year at 2.24%—a mere 117 to 105 basis points above the AAA muni benchmark yields. As the district's finances have deteriorated, its borrowing costs have plunged. Go figure.<br />Five years ago Chicago schools had to pay an 8.5% yield—a 580 basis-point penalty above AAA—to sell debt amid concerns that soaring labor and pension costs would drive the district into bankruptcy. Asked at the time whether the district would be able to borrow again, then CPS CEO Forrest Claypool replied: “I don’t know.”<br />What a difference a pandemic and Federal Reserve commitment to keep rates at near zero make. Muni bonds are thinly traded and usually held in portfolio for duration. Most buyers need fixed-income assets that produce steady returns, which explains the ravenous appetite for higher-yielding muni bonds.<br />“Buyers are just starved for yield and the inflows into high-yield funds have been astronomical for at least the last couple of weeks,” one muni-market analyst explained to Bond Buyer. Increased demand has made it cheaper than ever for state and local governments to borrow and has compressed price spreads between high- and low-rated bonds.</td>

Democrats won tax-rebate checks and a delay in the tax-rate cuts for their efforts. This made the bill worse as economic policy, but Mr. Bush made the concessions rather than jam his bill through with only GOP votes.<br />That isn’t how President Biden is playing the politics of his $1.9 trillion spending bill in the current 50-50 Senate. Last week he made a show of listening at the White House to 10 GOP Senators who made an initial counteroffer of $618 billion. Mr. Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill then ignored the GOP and rammed a budget resolution for the $1.9 trillion through the Senate and House on a partisan vote. So much for bipartisanship.<br />The truth is that the Democrats refused even to negotiate. Instead they moved to pass the bill through a process known as budget reconciliation that skirts the 60-vote filibuster rule and requires only 50 votes plus Vice President Kamala Harris to pass. And that’s how it passed the Senate in the wee hours Friday morning, 51-50. It later passed the House, 219-209, with no Republicans in support.<br />It’s true the GOP used reconciliation twice in 2017 on health care and tax reform. But Democrats refused to negotiate on either one. The Resistance dictated that Democrats oppose all things Donald Trump. They didn’t even try to mitigate the reduction in the state-and-local tax deduction that most affected blue states like California. This time Mr. Biden has a specific GOP proposal he won’t even consider.<br />The Senate debate last week included a multitude of revealing amendments about the partisan Democratic strategy. Our favorite is the switcheroo by Senators Jon Tester (Montana) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.) on the Keystone XL pipeline. First they voted for a GOP amendment opposing Mr. Biden’s plan to shut down the pipeline that would provide thousands of high-paying energy jobs. But they later voted for a Democratic amendment at the end of the debate that passed 51-50 and erased that Keystone amendment. This is an instant Beltway swamp classic.</td>

The agreement capped months of negotiations that had recently deteriorated to the point where the city was threatening to block Chicago teachers from logging into remote learning and the teachers were threatening to not show up for work.<br />On Friday, talks had reached an impasse after the city issued a “last, best and final offer,” with the two sides apparently heading toward a lockout and strike.

House impeachment managers haven’t yet indicated whether there will be new witnesses in the trial, leaving its scope and duration up in the air, according to lawmakers and aides. Mr. Trump’s lawyers turned down a request for the former president to appear.<br />At the same time, Democrats are debating who should be eligible for $1,400 direct checks and whether they can pass a $15 minimum wage as part of the pandemic-related stimulus package.<br />“The Senate’s going to do all three things next week. We’re going to do our constitutional responsibility and hold a trial. It won’t last very long. We’re going to move forward nominees and we’re going to continue to push forward Covid-relief legislation,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) said on Fox News Sunday.</td>

That’s the same time as last year and every year for the last decade.<br />The last time the Super Bowl wasn’t at 6:30 p.m. was in the distant time of 2010, before a radical shift brought it to its current slot. That year, the game was at 6:25 p.m., five minutes earlier than 6:30 p.m. In 2009, it was at 6 p.m. In 2008, it was at 6:17 p.m. On four occasions, it was even at 6:18 p.m. The NFL has dabbled in much experimentation during the six o’clock hour before finding the comfort of 6:30 p.m.<br />There are, however, some things about the big game that vary from year to year. That’s especially true in 2021 for an event that will look like never before with the country in the throes of a global pandemic. So here’s your quick guide to everything about the 55th Super Bowl, otherwise known as Super Bowl LV.<br />The Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. That’s especially exciting because of the teams’ two quarterbacks: Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady—the last two to win the Super Bowl.<br />Mahomes led the Chiefs to last year’s title. Brady has won six and this will be his 10th Super Bowl appearance. But the previous nine came with the New England Patriots, the team he left after last season. It’s a generational battle between the 43-year-old Brady and the 25-year-old Mahomes. One is toward the end of an all-time career. The other is at the beginning of one.</td>

      <td>President Harry Truman’s Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, called his memoir “Present at the Creation,” an account of rebuilding the postwar world and the realities of a Cold War with the Soviet Union. Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who died Saturday at age 100, titled his memoir “Turmoil and Triumph,” an apt description of the historic role Shultz played in ending the Cold War some 40 years later.<br />Shultz served as Ronald Reagan’s Secretary of State for almost the length of Reagan’s Presidency, from 1982 until 1989. The “turmoil” of his memoir’s title described the world as he took control of foreign policy for Reagan.<br />The Soviet Union, possessing a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons, was led by Yuri Andropov, a determined communist opponent of the West. Hard to believe now, but Europe then was still divided by what Winston Churchill called an “iron curtain,” which separated the free democratic nations of Western Europe from the closed, Soviet-dominated countries to the east. Millions were imprisoned inside these countries, unable to emigrate. Those who tried to flee could be imprisoned or shot.<br />The competition between the U.S. and Soviet Union was global, extending into Central America, the Middle East, East, East and Southeast Asia and Africa. Shultz, like Reagan, was determined to end the Cold War.<br />It was in some ways an unlikely role for Shultz, who earned his Ph.D. in industrial economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after serving in the Marine Corps during World War II. His thinking on economics later came to be associated with such free-market economists as Milton Friedman and Ronald Coase at the University of Chicago, where Shultz served as dean of the business school in the 1960s.</td>

We can and must prosecute the people responsible to the fullest extent of the law. But we shouldn’t grant those who failed to abrogate liberal democracy a partial victory by rushing to pass unnecessary “domestic antiterrorism” laws that would undermine civil liberties.<br />I understand the desire to respond to this outrageous act of insurrectionary violence. But I believe we shouldn’t rush into ill-considered actions that undermine our freedoms and do nothing to increase our security. That is why I was the only senator to vote against the USA Patriot Act in 2001 and why I oppose new domestic antiterrorism laws today.<br />History makes clear that these new powers are likely to be used predominantly against black and brown communities and progressives. Consider the Palmer Raids against socialists and union organizers during the first Red Scare in 1919-20, or J. Edgar Hoover’s “Cointelpro” assault on the civil-rights and antiwar movements of the 1960s, or the targeting of Muslim Americans in this century’s war on terror.<br />The overwhelming tendency in domestic antiterrorism has been to use invasive and unconstitutional surveillance techniques to criminalize legitimate dissent. In recent years, many states have continued the trend by passing laws that treat antipipeline protesters—often indigenous Americans—essentially as domestic terrorists and saboteurs, imposing harsh criminal penalties on activities protected by the First Amendment.<br />This history was a basis for the recent statement by 135 civil-rights and civil-liberties organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and the NAACP, in opposition to any new domestic terrorism laws. I am proud to echo their call.</td>

      <td>Supply is ramping up, but many Americans are reluctant to get the shot and need to be persuaded.</td>
      <td>The Food and Drug Administration announced new steps last week to help ensure that Covid-19 tests, treatments and vaccines stay ahead of new, potentially more transmissible and virulent, variants, whose emergence makes widespread vaccination even more urgent. The longer it takes to get the virus under control, the harder it may become. And soon, the problem may be a vaccine glut if demand is weaker than expected.<br />After early challenges, vaccine delivery is keeping up with supply. But by the end of March, the monthly vaccine supply may reach 100 million doses. To keep pace, the vaccination rate would have to double and then some. This will require an all-of-the-above approach to administering vaccines, tapping substantial capacity in pharmacies, primary-care practices and other trusted health-care providers.<br />Especially with improved delivery, at some point, perhaps in April, supply will start exceeding demand. The challenge won’t be how to ration a scarce resource, but how to reach patients reluctant to get vaccinated. Based on the latest Kaiser Family Foundation tracking surveys, more than half of Americans say they don’t want to get vaccinated. Some may simply want to wait; others may be set against getting it.<br />One reason for the hesitancy may be that it was necessary to ration scarce doses at the start, causing many Americans to internalize the idea that some people may be more likely to benefit or more deserving than others. It is essential to emphasize in public-health messaging that every adult can benefit and deserves the protections they can provide, and there will be no reason to forgo it once the scarcity problem is solved.<br />Government at every level should work with as many partners as possible to expand access. More Americans will take the vaccine if they can get it at a comfortable location. Not everyone will be willing or able to line up at Dodger Stadium. Insurers, pharmacies and large employers can assist public-health systems to reach people in every community.</td>

But use U.S. taxpayers’ resources to promote the termination of unborn life in poor countries, and progressives call it “health” spending. A similar language game is played when international socialists organize political factions under the banner of “democracy” to consolidate power.<br />Abortion and democratic socialism are two causes the Biden administration plans to champion in the Northern Triangle of Central America—Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Sovereignty, respect for local cultural norms, and the economic aspirations of millions of have-nots have never been high ideals in Washington. But now the condescending ideologues are resupplied. The problem is likely to get worse.<br />Latin Americans have reason to distrust President Biden, who had special responsibility for the region during the Obama administration. One notable disaster in that time was Colombia’s surrender to the narco-trafficking group FARC. The agreement was cooked up in Havana with U.S. help. Colombians rejected it in a referendum, but then-President Juan Manuel Santos pushed it through anyway, with backing from Team Obama.<br />FARC leaders got amnesty and unelected seats in Congress, but the agreement has been a disaster for the South American nation. The cocaine business has exploded anew, FARC honchos have been caught in drug deals, and coca-growing regions are again immersed in bloody conflict. The discredited Mr. Santos has been reduced to lobbying the U.S. to take Havana off its list of state sponsors of terrorism.<br />In Central America, Biden administration foreign-policy makers want to reproduce a version of the United Nations’ International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (a k a CIGIG) that would span all three countries in the Northern Triangle.</td>

      <td>Harry Reid made frequent use of the ﬁlibuster when he led the Senate. A former Reid staffer is shocked that GOP leaders have done the same.</td>
      <td>One thing Americans can probably agree on right now is that Americans don’t agree on much of anything. The divisions are reflected in a Senate split between 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats. This might seem like a moment for modesty, but one of the new Senate’s first debates was whether Democrats should move to end the filibuster and push their agenda through on a simple majority. (Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties.) The filibuster rule appears to have received a stay of execution: Two Democrats have indicated that they won’t lend the votes needed to abolish it.<br />But the debate will return. Progressives have launched a sustained assault on the filibuster as a racist anachronism that allows a minority of senators to hijack the will of the American public by holding up legislation until a supermajority of 60 votes can be mustered to end debate. That is the thesis of Adam Jentleson’s “Kill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of American Democracy.” The Senate, he writes, “has become a kill switch” that “shuts down our democratic process.” But his account of “the problems facing the Senate and, by extension, the nation” is backward: Many of the Senate’s dysfunctions are downstream from the country’s divisions. The filibuster is a convenient villain for larger progressive frustration with constitutional government.<br />Mr. Jentleson presents his argument in two parts. The first traces the history of the filibuster. The tactic is nowhere in the Constitution, he observes, and first emerged in the 19th century. In 1917, amid a fight over isolationism, the Senate adopted Rule XXII. It allowed senators “to call a vote to end debate—to tell the kids to wrap it up,” Mr. Jentleson writes, a process known as “cloture.”<br />He concedes that filibusters have “sometimes been deployed by liberals and progressives, and occasionally to historic effect” but have “mainly served to empower a minority of predominantly white conservatives to override our democratic system when they found themselves outnumbered.” He brings out the bazooka, calling Mitch McConnell one of the “modern acolytes” of slavery-defender John C. Calhoun. It is true that the filibuster allowed Southern Democrats to stall civil-rights legislation. It is also true that filibusters are now a commonplace of Senate life and are often used for tactical advantage at the expense of substance. But such uses are bipartisan. Democrats last year wouldn’t let debate begin on a police-reform bill by Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina.<br />Not so long ago, Democrats liked the filibuster. The practice is part of “the constitutional principles of checks and balances,” then-Sen. Harry Reid said in 2005, when filibustering George W. Bush’s judicial nominees was in vogue. Mr. Jentleson is a former aide to Mr. Reid, who as majority leader routinely shut down the Senate from taking votes of any consequence. You might say he ran the place with a kill switch.</td>

      <td>Small clinical trial found that it doesn’t appear to protect recipients against mild and moderate illness from a fast-spreading new strain of the coronavirus</td>
      <td>JOHANNESBURG—South Africa said Sunday it would temporarily halt a planned rollout of  AstraZeneca  PLC’s Covid-19 vaccine after a small clinical trial found that it doesn’t appear to protect recipients against mild and moderate illness from a fast-spreading new strain of the coronavirus first detected in the country.<br />The trial, which enrolled around 2,000 volunteers with a median age of 31 in South Africa, was too small and its participants too young to draw broad conclusions on the vaccine’s overall efficacy in protecting against the disease caused by the coronavirus, especially when it comes to hospitalizations or death. However, its findings contribute to concerns that a mutating virus is rendering existing Covid-19 vaccines less effective and that shots will need to be updated to protect against new virus strains.<br />Of the 39 volunteers in the AstraZeneca trial that were found to be infected with the new South African variant, 19 had received the vaccine, while 20 had received a placebo, said Shabir Madhi, the trial’s principal investigator and dean of the medical school at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Those numbers would imply an efficacy rate of around 10% at protecting against mild and moderate Covid-19 from the new variant, said Dr. Madhi, although he added that the data were too limited to be statistically significant.<br />After the results were announced, South Africa’s health minister, Zweli Mkhize, said the country would temporarily halt a planned rollout of the vaccine until there was more information on the vaccine’s efficacy. The country had planned to administer a first shipment of one million doses of the vaccine to health-care workers later this month.<br />Johnson & Johnson  and  Novavax Inc.,  whose vaccines have yet to be authorized in any country, have also found that their shots were less effective in recent human clinical trials in South Africa, compared with trials in the U.S. or the U.K. But their vaccines were still found to be 50% or more effective at preventing mild or moderate cases of Covid-19 and even more potent at shielding recipients from severe illness and hospitalization from the new strain.</td>

A clip of the interview was released Sunday morning. The full interview will run Sunday afternoon.<br />Asked by CBS News whether the U.S. will lift sanctions to convince Iran to participate in negotiations, Mr. Biden said, “No.” When CBS asked whether Iran must stop enriching uranium first, Mr. Biden nodded.<br />The Biden administration has previously said Iran must come into compliance with the 2015 agreement before sanctions will be lifted. “President Biden supports diplomacy to deal with the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear program, but he certainly isn’t going to offer sanctions relief just to get Iran back to the table, which is what the question suggested,” a White House official said on Sunday.<br />Before President Biden’s interview, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in a speech Sunday reiterated Iran’s stance that it is Washington that must lift sanctions and come back into compliance with the nuclear accord.</td>

      <td>From stimulus to school admissions, leaders act as if ease is the only worthy goal.</td>
      <td>Has an era of American mediocrity begun? In January the College Board announced it would eliminate the essay portion of the SAT, as well as all of the separate SAT subject tests. Their stated purpose was “reducing and simplifying demands on students.” Such a burden.<br />One high school near me just dropped freshman advanced-standing (honors) English “to combat the effects of academic ‘tracking” because it “ultimately separates students of different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds.” It turns out that middle schools from lower-income areas aren’t adequately preparing their students for high school. So rather than fix that problem, they dumbed down high school.<br />Then again, when the University of California system did away with racial preferences in 1996, it moved to holistic admissions. What does holistic mean? Anything you want. The Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities defines it as “assessing an applicant’s unique experiences alongside traditional measures of academic readiness.” Grades are only a suggestion—and SAT scores are biased, supposedly. And here you thought smart students got into good colleges. Yes, mediocrity has crept into our self-proclaimed elite colleges. Job recruiters understand this.<br />Virtually all universities and now many companies have D&I departments, for diversity and inclusion. Sounds worthy. But as far as I can tell, the No. 1 job of a D&I department is to hire more people into the D&I department. No one ever mentions excellence.<br />Many schools, like Hampshire College, Antioch University and Reed College, don’t even bother with meaningful grades—feelings might get hurt. Yes, the same Reed College  Apple  co-founder Steve Jobs attended for six months. He took courses in calligraphy, dance and Shakespeare. Reed students do receive a loosey-goosey grade-point average, but “papers and exams are generally returned to students with lengthy comments but without grades affixed.” Out in real life, Jobs was graded every day by customers, employees and investors.</td>

      <td>Removal from office is best understood as akin to a ‘mandatory minimum’ sentence for a crime.</td>
      <td>During the impeachment of Bill Clinton, his defenders argued that his misconduct was ultimately private and didn’t rise to the level of an impeachable offense. In the current impeachment of Donald Trump, that’s a hard argument to make with a straight face, since the then-president’s offenses, culminating in the siege of the Capitol, were obviously public and political. So his defenders claim instead that it’s unconstitutional for the Senate to try him now that he’s no longer in office.<br />Forty-five Republican senators voted in favor of Sen. Rand Paul‘s motion challenging the Senate’s jurisdiction to try Trump. But scholarship on this question has matured substantially since that vote, and it has exposed the serious weakness of Mr. Paul’s analysis.<br />The strongest argument against the Senate’s authority to try a former officer relies on Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution, which provides: “The president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” The trial’s opponents argue that because this provision requires removal, and because only incumbent officers can be removed, it follows that only incumbent officers can be impeached and tried.<br />But the provision cuts against their interpretation. It simply establishes what is known in criminal law as a “mandatory minimum” punishment: If an incumbent officeholder is convicted by a two-thirds vote of the Senate, he is removed from office as a matter of law.<br />If removal were the only punishment that could be imposed, the argument against trying former officers would be compelling. But it isn’t. Article I, Section 3 authorizes the Senate to impose an optional punishment on conviction: “disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.”</td>

      <td>Under current market conditions 50-year Treasuries are no panacea.</td>
      <td>In “Need Discount Debt? Try 50-Year Bonds” (op-ed, Jan. 29), Jon Hartley notes that the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee advised against issuing these bonds. He writes: “But its analysis missed how many long-term Treasurys could be bought up by defined-benefit pension funds looking for assets that match the duration (interest-rate risk) of their liabilities (payouts to pensioners in the future).” But doing so won’t help solve the main problem facing public and multiemployer defined-benefit pensions: underfunding.<br />The 50-year bonds would have to be purchased so that the amount of cash thrown off in the future is sufficient to pay the pension liabilities. Earning 2% will do nothing to achieve the 6%-7% returns that typical plans will require to curb underfunding.<br />A newly formed defined-benefit plan (a rarity, to be sure) could use 50-year Treasurys to achieve a fully funded, duration-matched plan, but would either have to promise much lower benefits to its retirees or make far higher contributions to the plan than typical existing plans do. The easiest way to grasp all this is to consider a fixed-dollar pension liability payable 50 years from now. If a 50-year Treasury strip (i.e., zero-coupon bond) existed, the plan could purchase this strip with a face value equal to the liability. The problem is that if the strips’s yield is, say, around 3%, the purchase cost will be far higher than if the strip yielded 6% or 7%. Reducing the amount purchased to reduce the cost will result in underfunding. Either way, under current market conditions 50-year Treasurys are no panacea.<br />Prof. Michael Stutzer<br />University of Colorado</td>

The 58-year-old former constitutional-law professor will lead eight other Democrats in seeking to persuade the Senate to convict Mr. Trump of inciting an insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />In a legal brief last week, Mr. Raskin alleged that Mr. Trump “created a powder keg” in which hundreds of people “were prepared for violence at his direction.” Mr. Trump’s lawyers have argued that Mr. Trump didn’t engage in insurrection, saying that he had “exercised his First Amendment right under the Constitution to express his belief that the election results were suspect” and that he hadn’t incited violence.<br />On Thursday, Mr. Raskin asked Mr. Trump to testify—a request that Mr. Trump’s lawyers shot down, calling it a “public relations stunt.” Mr. Trump’s brief is due on Monday.<br />Many Republicans have condemned Mr. Trump’s actions in telling a crowd amassed on the Ellipse to march to the Capitol and to “fight” to overturn Joe Biden’s November election victory, which was being certified in Congress that day. Some GOP senators have said they were open to convicting him.</td>

      <td>To broadcast Super Bowl LV in the Covid Age, the NFL had to rethink the game-day playbook. So this year, 30,000 life-size cutouts and a mere 25,000 fans—7,500 of whom are vaccinated health-care workers—will be in the stands at Tampa’s Raymond James Stadium (capacity: 65,618) to witness history.<br />But today’s spectacle involves far more than watching the showdown between the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The event promises some new faces in both the performances and the ads. The star-studded lineup includes country music’s Eric Church and R&B’s Jazmine Sullivan singing the national anthem, and Grammy-winning singer-songwriter H.E.R. performing “America the Beautiful.” The Weeknd, also a Grammy winner who now calls the Grammys “corrupt,” will headline the halftime show. And on the heels of her acclaimed Inauguration Day appearance, youth poet laureate Amanda Gorman will take the stage. Here are more insights on what to watch for during the big game:<br />Will any football actually be played amid all the superstar performances?<br />Yes, kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. eastern on CBS. The game will feature a quarterback matchup between Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady, his elder by almost 20 years, with the Bucs. This will be Brady’s 10th Super Bowl appearance, an NFL record. (If Tampa Bay wins on Sunday, Brady would become the first player ever to win seven NFL championships, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.)<br />These are tumultuous times.

Consumer spending hasn’t kept pace with the broader recovery in economic output. Debt levels, already a problem before the pandemic, grew at their fastest pace in more than a decade during the first nine months of 2020, while asset bubbles in stocks and real estate kept growing. China’s central bank faces a tricky balance between reining in stimulus without causing growth to sputter.<br />And now, a resurgence of Covid-19 infections in some parts of China, combined with a slow rollout of vaccines, is raising fresh worries about the outlook. At a minimum, Beijing’s plan to limit travel during the coming Lunar New Year, which falls on Feb. 12, will likely hit consumer spending, economists say.<br />All this matters because China is becoming a bigger part of the global economy, and a more important driver of growth world-wide. If its performance in 2021 disappoints, it could hurt everyone, from car brands to gadget makers to soybean farmers who are counting on Chinese demand.</td>

Others are testing launchers using previous seed money and sometimes shoestring budgets. Still more projects in early development could hit a dead end, officials predict, because of potential funding shortfalls.<br />All competitors, though, confront the same market reality. Burgeoning corporate, civilian and military uses of compact satellites weighing under a ton—ranging from toaster-size models to versions resembling refrigerators—won’t generate enough demand to support the current glut of small launchers.<br />“Could the industry support 100 new launch companies? Of course not,” said Chuck Beames, chairman of small-satellite maker York Space Systems LLC and a former Pentagon space official who also chairs a trade association advocating for small spacecraft. He said a more realistic number would be four healthy small-rocket operators and several established companies flying larger commercial boosters.<br />The latter group, primarily targeting a different market segment of huge satellites headed into higher orbits, include Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Europe’s Arianespace SA and Blue Origin Federation LLC, run by  Amazon.com  Chief Executive Jeff Bezos. United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between  Boeing Co.  and Lockheed Martin, specializes in carrying large Pentagon satellites.

Unemployment fell and economic activity picked up much faster than expected. Unlike in previous recessions, equity and housing markets have done well.<br />All of those factors bolstered state and local revenues last year. But pandemic-related costs have soared in many localities, resulting in budget holes that may force states to cut back on other services, lay off workers or raise taxes, absent more federal aid. Policy analysts estimate state and local revenue losses due to the pandemic will total about $300 billion through fiscal year 2022, though that doesn’t include rising expenses.<br />State and local governments employ 18.6 million people, who provide services from collecting trash to teaching children. Democrats in Congress are pushing for $360 billion in aid to cities and states as part of President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, while many Republicans argue that would only encourage fiscal profligacy.</td>

The family says it was likely one hearing away from having the government take possession of the land when President Biden took office.<br />Mr. Biden issued an executive order on his first day in office to stop construction of the border wall temporarily, while evaluating how to halt it permanently. The move followed Mr. Biden’s campaign promises to halt construction of the border wall—President Donald Trump’s signature campaign promise.<br />Stopping construction for good, however, is complicated. Sections of the wall are already partially built and federal money is already spent or appropriated for the wall. Construction of a border fence that started under President George W. Bush, for example, continued under President Barack Obama, who didn’t actively support it.<br />The Cavazoses are among hundreds of landowners in limbo as the Biden administration evaluates what to do next.</td>

      <td>The slow start of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, along with the arrival of new virus variants, has dashed some business leaders’ hopes for getting back to normal in 2021.<br />Consumers are unlikely to resume travel, dining out and shopping in stores at a pre-pandemic cadence until later this year, chiefs of some large companies told Wall Street analysts and investors in recent weeks. Some CEOs said consumer activity could pick up as soon as spring. Others pointed to a recovery later in the year—or even 2022.<br />“Let me underscore that progress on economic growth is contingent on an effective vaccine rollout program globally,” said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO David Solomon. “In its absence, economic recovery will be unnecessarily delayed.”<br />The pandemic has unevenly bolstered and derailed growth prospects; divided workforces into staff able to shelter at home and those who must report in person for duty; and reshaped consumer purchasing as stay-at-home orders change. The rapid shifts have complicated financial forecasts and made consumer behavior hard to predict.<br />John Idol, CEO of Capri Holdings Ltd., which owns Versace and Michael Kors, said online luxury spending is strong but the near-term outlook is challenged because jumps in Covid-19 cases have caused additional restrictions and temporary store closures.</td>

      <td>Following mass arrests and police violence, the opposition in Russia shifts focus from the streets to the ballot box</td>
      <td>MOSCOW—The jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny last month galvanized the biggest popular protests in Russia in nearly a decade, as his supporters were joined across the country by average Russians upset with falling living standards and shrinking political freedoms.<br />But Mr. Navalny’s allies have scrapped further protests following the detention of more than 6,000 in the recent demonstrations as well as police violence against the protesters—factors that could make it more difficult to keep mobilizing followers.<br />Instead, his movement will focus on parliamentary elections this September, when his backers hope to unseat the ruling United Russia party loyal to President Vladimir Putin.<br />The rallies triggered a crackdown by authorities, as police beat protesters and detained thousands, including many top allies of the opposition leader. That use of force risked putting average Russians who had gravitated to the movement on a dangerous path to confrontation with the Kremlin, said Leonid Volkov, one of Mr. Navalny’s top lieutenants.<br />“Tens of millions of people watched with horror as [Mr. Putin] showed he was ready to beat peaceful unarmed protesters with his storm troopers,” said Mr. Volkov in a video to supporters Thursday.</td>

Futures for West Texas Intermediate—or WTI, the main grade of U.S. crude—last week surpassed $55 a barrel for the first time in over a year.<br />The speed of the recovery has surprised some investors and analysts, given that coronavirus continues to curtail demand. It has juiced shares of companies including  Exxon Mobil Corp .  and  ConocoPhillips  after a troubled 2020 for oil-and-gas producers, making energy stocks the best performers on the S&P 500 this year.<br />“The market definitely has some momentum,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC, a hedge fund that invests in energy derivatives. “WTI is going to be targeting $60, too.”<br />Oil is rising against a mixed economic backdrop, with data published Friday suggesting that the labor market faces a long road to recovery. But the stock market continues to power higher, in part because investors expect a new dose of fiscal stimulus and vaccines to goose growth.</td>

      <td>Ease of transmission, new strains, limits of vaccination programs all mean Covid-19 will be around for years—and a big business</td>
      <td>Vaccination drives hold out the promise of curbing Covid-19, but governments and businesses are increasingly accepting what epidemiologists have long warned: The pathogen will circulate for years, or even decades, leaving society to coexist with Covid-19 much as it does with other endemic diseases like flu, measles, and HIV.<br />The ease with which the coronavirus spreads, the emergence of new strains and poor access to vaccines in large parts of the world mean Covid-19 could shift from a pandemic disease to an endemic one, implying lasting modifications to personal and societal behavior, epidemiologists say.<br />“Going through the five phases of grief, we need to come to the acceptance phase that our lives are not going to be the same,” said Thomas Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “I don’t think the world has really absorbed the fact that these are long-term changes.”<br />Endemic Covid-19 doesn’t necessarily mean continuing coronavirus restrictions, infectious-disease experts said, largely because vaccines are so effective at preventing severe disease and slashing hospitalizations and deaths. Hospitalizations have already fallen 30% in Israel after it vaccinated a third of its population. Deaths there are expected to plummet in weeks ahead.<br />But some organizations are planning for a long-term future in which prevention methods such as masking, good ventilation and testing continue in some form. Meanwhile, a new and potentially lucrative Covid-19 industry is emerging quickly, as businesses invest in goods and services such as air-quality monitoring, filters, diagnostic kits and new treatments.</td>

Political activists and civilian politicians, prominently Aung San Suu Kyi, the hugely popular leader whose government they deposed, are detained. On Saturday, when demonstrations began, widely circulated text messages falsely claimed Ms. Suu Kyi had been released—an effort, activists said, to decrease turnout.<br />Still, people began streaming out of their homes as early as 9 a.m. on Sunday. Many carried posters of Ms. Suu Kyi, who is confined in her residence in the nation’s capital. They shouted, “release our leaders,” and wore red T-shirts and headbands—the color associated with her party. Supporters huddled in the opened-up trunks of their cars and waved her party’s flag.<br />Police in riot gear were present and barricades were set up to block demonstrators from marching toward downtown Yangon.</td>

      <td>Drinking is on the rise as a response to stress, but a growing number of people are choosing to give up alcohol before it becomes a problem</td>
      <td>Back in mid-March, as schools and businesses began to close and people headed home to hunker down, Amanda, a 44-year-old yoga instructor in Portland, Maine (who asked that her real name not be used for privacy reasons), decided to address one of the many worries that had begun to consume her day. “And that was whether I was drinking too much,” she says. Already, friends who suddenly had more time on their hands were ending their work days at 4 p.m. with a glass of wine or breaking out the “good tequila” on a Tuesday just to have “something to look forward to.”<br />Several studies conducted last fall determined that binge drinking has increased during the pandemic. A study of more than 1,500 adults published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in September found that the frequency of alcohol consumption increased 14% over the previous year for all adults. For women, binge drinking went up a whopping 41%.<br />Amanda wasn’t a problem drinker, but she worried that she could easily become one during the pandemic. “Removing the option entirely felt far easier than expecting myself to moderate, given all that was going on,” she says. She’s part of a growing number of people inspired by the pandemic to adopt a sort of preemptive sobriety. In July, a survey of 2,000 people commissioned by the addiction-awareness group Alcohol Change UK found that 7% of participants had stopped drinking completely during the lockdown.<br />The alcohol-alternative beverage market, meanwhile, has exploded and is now expected to exceed $29 billion by 2026. Jen Batchelor, the cofounder of Kin Euphorics, a line of non-alcoholic drinks, says that sales of their most popular canned cocktail, Kin Spritz, have quadrupled during the pandemic. “People are recognizing they don’t want to poison their power supply while the state of the world is what it is,” says Ms. Batchelor. “They want to maintain their agency at a time that’s already mood roulette. But the mentality is not, ‘I kicked alcohol.’ It’s ‘I shifted away from alcohol.’ It’s a choice, rather than what we often think of as a necessity, someone’s need to stop drinking—or else.”<br />“I think a lot of people are coming at sobriety from a fresh, modern, data-driven lens these days, where it’s so easy to measure the inputs in your life and what variables make you feel a different way—what affects your sleep, your hydration, your mindfulness,” says Bill Shufelt, co-founder and CEO of Athletic Brewing Company, a nonalcoholic craft brewery whose 2020 sales were up more than 500% over the year before. “And I think isolation and being in their houses has especially helped people identify the variables that are making them feel better or worse.”</td>

With millions of professionals doing their jobs at home, improving digital documents became more urgent for Mr. Narayen. So did adding and refining features so people could better collaborate while working remotely.<br />“Everybody going digital was not going to come again,” he said.<br />To lead in a crisis, Mr. Narayen said, managers must give people permission to stop doing projects not deemed essential for the moment, while also changing how work is done. Adobe has made efforts to not host meetings before 9 a.m., for example, and to regularly give employees additional time off on some Fridays so that they can relax and spend time with their families. “These are different times,” he said. “It’s not business as usual.”<br />Mr. Narayen, who became CEO in 2007, is one of the longest serving chieftains in the technology world. In 2013 Adobe said it would stop selling boxed versions of its software and instead directed customers to cloud-based subscriptions, embracing such a transformation before many other industry giants did. Adobe’s revenue rose to a record $12.87 billion in the 2020 fiscal year; this year the company expects revenue will surpass $15 billion. It now employs roughly 22,500 people.</td>

      <td>One secret of Amazon’s ability to grow rapidly: software and algorithms that manage its millions of employees and marketplace sellers—technologies Andy Jassy knows well</td>
      <td>Andy Jassy is taking over a very unusual “tech” company.<br />Amazon  has many times more employees than any of its competitors, such as Microsoft, Google and Apple, and many are low-skilled manual laborers, rather than software engineers. Amazon is also a partner with approximately 2.4 million active marketplace sellers, who generate the majority of sales on its retail platform. But the incoming chief executive, Mr. Jassy—a loyal deputy and devoted student of founder Jeff Bezos—has at his disposal a powerful tool for managing such a vast ocean of workers and partners: an equally vast cloud-software infrastructure that he has overseen from its start.<br />Amazon uses software to manage in a way that’s unlike almost any other company, except maybe gig-economy giants Uber,  Lyft ,   DoorDash  and Instacart. Whether they’re driving a delivery van, picking items from shelves or trying to maintain their product inventory to avoid being delisted, Amazon’s employees, subcontractors and seller-partners are monitored, evaluated, rewarded and even flagged for reprimand or coaching by software.<br />While Mr. Jassy is often described by those who have worked for him as being a lot like Jeff Bezos, but perhaps warmer and fuzzier, there is arguably at present a sharp contrast between the way he treats his immediate reports and the way Amazon’s algorithms and artificial intelligence treat its millions of front-line workers and marketplace sellers. If Mr. Jassy can figure out how to use algorithms to manage workers and partners as humanely as he apparently manages the people he works with personally, that may prove to be his defining legacy as CEO.<br />Having built Amazon Web Services from a tiny startup he headed within Amazon, begun in the early 2000s, into the behemoth of the cloud market (and generator of half of Amazon’s profits), Mr. Jassy understands not only the internet plumbing for countless tech companies AWS supports, from  Netflix  to Slack, but also how it’s plugged into the myriad businesses owned by Amazon itself. Now 53 years old, Mr. Jassy joined Amazon in 1997, immediately after graduating from Harvard Business School.</td>

      <td>The tech industry’s titans were already huge before Covid-19, the subject of soaring valuations and snowballing antitrust investigations. The pandemic has only made them bigger. A lot bigger.<br />In almost every facet of life—the tools we use to work, study, and play; how we shop and interact; the way companies operate and market their products—people and businesses have become more reliant on technology over the past year. Even amid one of the most punishing economic downturns on record, spending surged on computers, videogames, online retail, cloud-computing services and digital advertising.<br />The result was dizzying growth for some of the largest corporations in history—and for their stock prices. At a time when companies such as airlines and bricks-and-mortar retailers struggled to survive, combined revenue for the five biggest U.S. tech companies— Apple Inc.,   Microsoft Corp. ,  Amazon.com Inc.,  Google-parent Alphabet Inc., and  Facebook Inc. —grew by a fifth, to $1.1 trillion. Their aggregate profit rose an even faster 24%. And their combined market capitalization soared by half over the past year to a staggering $8 trillion.<br />Their economic sway expanded in other ways, too, including employment: Amazon alone added 500,000 new workers in a single year, roughly equivalent to the entire population of Atlanta.<br />Lawmakers and regulators may yet find ways to rein them in, but the economic and societal forces propelling Big Tech to even higher heights seem likely to outlast Covid-19. Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella has said that he expects spending on technology to double to 10% of gross domestic product from its current level of 5%. This month he said he now expects that to happen even faster.</td>

If so, why do parents still have a nagging suspicion that these games are harmful in some insidious way?<br />Decades of research haven’t established a firm link between violence committed in games and violence committed in real life. Yet questions persist about the subtle effects that violent games have on developing minds. The questions have become more pressing as the pandemic drags on. U.S. consumers spent nearly $19 billion on videogames in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 26% increase from the prior-year period, according to the NPD Group. “Fortnite” and “Minecraft” were among the best-selling games in the quarter.<br />On the one hand, videogames have been a saving grace during a time of little other social interaction. Yet we still worry about how all of this time spent shooting, stabbing and bludgeoning friends, strangers and bots alike will affect kids.</td>

      <td>Eateries and grocers are selling more takeaway sushi during the pandemic, while supermarkets rush to train chefs</td>
      <td>At a bleak moment for restaurants, sushi takeout is on a roll.<br />Customer appetites for to-go sushi are rising, from $10 grocery-store rolls to elaborate, exquisitely packaged meals costing hundreds of dollars. Japanese restaurants say the demand is helping them to stay afloat, and to reach new customers through delivery and to-go options. The number of sushi restaurants open in the U.S. grew by 5% last year as numbers for steakhouses and Italian restaurants fell, according to online-directory  Yelp .<br />Kaho Lo, a 40-year-old software engineer from San Jose, Calif., used to get sushi weekly at his  Adobe Inc.  office cafeteria. During the pandemic, he tried making it himself but found it hard to find high-quality fish. Seasoning the rice and forming it into rolls proved challenging, too, and he hasn’t done it again.<br />“When there’s a spot that offers sushi for takeout, I’m all over it,” Mr. Lo said.<br />High demand for sushi comes at a dark time for restaurants overall. Sales at restaurants and bars of $659 billion last year were down by nearly a quarter from 2019, according to National Restaurant Association estimates, and more than 110,000 bars and restaurants closed at least temporarily. Employment at bars and restaurants is down by nearly 2.4 million, Labor Department estimates show.</td>

Last June, CoronaVac received emergency-use authorization in China, limiting it to use within certain groups of high-risk individuals.<br />From Latin America to Africa and Asia, many developing countries have pinned their hopes on CoronaVac and other Chinese vaccine candidates as richer nations snap up inoculations developed in the West. CoronaVac can be stored in an ordinary refrigerator, making it cheaper and easier to transport than others that require subzero storage temperatures.<br />Beyond mainland China and Hong Kong, Turkey and Ukraine are among nations that have reported orders for CoronaVac. Brazil has agreed to buy up to 100 million doses, while Turkey has purchased 50 million shots.</td>

      <td>Off Brand is a thrice-monthly column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />WEDDING OUTFITS get all the attention—from bespoke suits to custom gowns to unconventional but no less strategized statements like jumpsuits, Army uniforms and Renaissance Fair costumes.<br />But wedding style’s evil stepsister, the divorce look, is gaining clout in the zeitgeist. When child-star-turned-fashion-mogul Mary-Kate Olsen and French banker Olivier Sarkozy finalized their divorce last month via Zoom, screenshots of the proceedings taken by court reporters went viral. Ms. Olsen, whose brand the Row epitomizes quiet sophistication, wore a chic black turtleneck that was instantly dissected and memed. With her long wavy hair unkempt in a relatable pandemic-ish way, she looked uniquely herself. And was that a hint of a smile?<br />The enthusiastic online response to the screenshot evoked the glory days of Hollywood divorce, when plebes watched awestruck as stars like Elizabeth Taylor (eight marriages) and Zsa Zsa Gabor (nine marriages) made serial break-ups glamorous. When Marilyn Monroe divorced Joe DiMaggio in 1954 after nine months of marriage, she famously wore a little black dress, high pumps and white gloves to the courthouse. She was filmed beaming and waving outside its chambers—a scene that would have fit seamlessly into one of her movies.<br />No one formula prescribes what to wear to one’s divorce proceedings, whether they take the form of mediation, litigation, or, now, a video call. Yet few would deny that one’s appearance plays a role in the outcome, with so much at stake: money, home, custody. The websites of family-law practices often include lengthy treatises advising men and women on what to wear to court, with the emphasis on classic silk blouses, prim dresses and sober suits. Some firms go further: Claire Samuels Law, a family law and divorce mediation firm in Charlotte, N.C., offers the services of a high-end stylist, and posts style ideas such as Prada pumps and minimalist Valextra handbags to its Instagram account.</td>

      <td>A MoMA exhibit explores the ways European art movements of the 1920s and ‘30s responded to and furthered the social and political upheaval of the time.</td>
      <td>New York<br /><br />These days when modernism is coupled with “utopian” or “idealistic,” it’s with a disparaging tone meant to emphasize the naïveté of the idea. Yet in the early 20th century, in a society transformed by the Russian Revolution and World War I, modernism seemed to embody hope for a better future and to repudiate a problematic past. For many artists, a new pared-down aesthetic and a bold, experimental embrace of the latest technologies, materials and techniques aptly expressed the aspirations of a startlingly altered world.<br />“Engineer, Agitator, Constructor: The Artist Reinvented,” at the Museum of Modern Art, explores the ways, in the 1920s and ’30s, adventurous art was put into the service of politics and social change in Soviet Russia, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and elsewhere in Europe. Russian Constructivism, De Stijl, the Bauhaus, Futurism, and Dada are all represented by posters, advertisements, magazine layouts, books, typography, films, broadsides, theater design, and just plain propaganda, sparsely punctuated by paintings and prints that provide welcome refreshment from the commercial inclusions. Much of the exhibition celebrates the 2018 gift of more than 300 early 20th-century works on paper from the Merrill C. Berman collection, with selections of similarly “functional” works from MoMA’s holdings.<br />We are reminded that after the cataclysms of revolution and war, some artists began to question not only the nature of what they did, but also its necessity. The pragmatic dominated. We learn that the Latvian graphic designer Gustav Klutsis posited an “artist of an entirely new type”—“a public person, a specialist in political and cultural work with the masses”—while the Russian painter Liubov Popova, who said she desired “to translate the aesthetic to the production plane,” abandoned the easel for agitprop theater sets, costume design, and other useful projects. (A couple of abstract, colored linoleum cuts, with bold jostling planes, make us wish she hadn’t.)</td>

      <td>If  GameStop  is a bubble, it’s hardly the first.<br />From tulip mania in the 17th century to the dot-com spectacle of the 1990s, bubbles have boosted—and burned—investors for centuries.<br />Here’s a look at some previous bubbles:<br />When tulips were introduced to Western Europe in the 16th century, they were prized for their brilliant colors. Eventually, though, the Dutch took the tulip trade to the next level, as the 19th century writer Charles Mackay points out in his book “Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.” The people of 17th century Holland were no strangers to markets and trade. The stock exchange in Amsterdam had been operating since 1602, and the Dutch East India Company was already selling bonds and stocks.<br />Limited supply, plus an appetite for rare bulbs, made prices skyrocket. At one point, a single rare bulb could be exchanged for dozens of items, including oxen, swine and sheep, according to Mr. Mackay. The bulb market reached its peak in 1636 and 1637 before collapsing, pushing some investors into financial ruin.</td>

Chief Executive Elon Musk, is suddenly worth a total of more than $6 billion.<br />It is called dogecoin, a homage to bitcoin that was designed to serve no real purpose. Dogecoin holders can’t buy much with it and can’t easily convert it to cash. For most of its life, the virtual currency has traded for no reason other than to generate online laughs.<br />Dogecoin is named after an internet meme that surfaced nearly a decade ago. The meme centered around an image of a Shiba Inu dog with bad spelling habits (thus doge instead of dog). Users Photoshopped the dog’s furry face onto everything from astronauts to Twinkies.<br />In 2013, the software developer Billy Markus was watching bitcoin gain in popularity and decided to make his own lighthearted cryptocurrency. He first based it on the videogame “Animal Crossing,” and called it bells, named after the game’s pretend currency.<br />People online hated it, he said. So when another developer, Jackson Palmer, shared a new idea for a cryptocurrency based on the doge meme, Mr. Markus reconfigured his code for bells to fit the meme.</td>

And because the stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person will have limits based on household income, it matters which year the payments are based on.<br />So why would it matter when you file your tax return?

Those who wait would have their payments based on 2019 income and family size.<br />“If it’s filed electronically, it’s processed almost immediately, and the information is then available to the IRS almost instantaneously,” said David Kautter, who was the top tax-policy official at the Treasury Department during the first two rounds of payments.</td>

Police in riot gear were deployed in large numbers and trucks with water cannons were present in the area, raising fears of a crackdown.<br />The coup took place in the early hours of Monday, when soldiers raided the homes of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other officials ahead of a new session of parliament. Ms. Suu Kyi’s party had trounced its military-backed opponents by a big margin in national elections in November. The military said it was taking control because election officials didn’t address its complaints about fraud involving the country’s voter lists.<br />Ms. Suu Kyi remains detained in her house in the nation’s capital. Political activists and a number of her key aides are also detained. The U.S. and many other foreign governments have condemned the takeover and asked the army to reverse course.<br />The military, or Tatmadaw as it is known in Myanmar, has been in control for most of the past 73 years since the country won independence from British colonial rule. It began a celebrated shift toward democracy a decade ago but that process ended abruptly this week. The military has a history of violent crackdowns against pro-democracy demonstrators.</td>

Amazon shares fell 2% Wednesday.<br />Chevron Corp.<br />Two of Standard Oil’s biggest descendants considered a reunion. The leaders of Chevron and  Exxon Mobil Corp.  discussed merging their companies last year, following the coronavirus outbreak that put them under tremendous financial strain. Such a deal would reshape the oil industry and reunite the two offshoots of John D. Rockefeller’s oil monopoly, which was broken up by U.S. regulators in 1911. The talks were preliminary and aren’t ongoing, but could come back in the future. But a merger of the two largest American oil companies could encounter regulatory and antitrust challenges under the Biden administration. Chevron shares added 1.4% Monday.<br />Alphabet Inc.</td>

      <td>The school board is set to eliminate merit exams for admission to an acclaimed school.</td>
      <td>First, George Washington and Abe Lincoln get the boot as school names. Now academic achievement will soon be history. The progressive beat goes on in San Francisco, where the school board next week is expected to consider a resolution abolishing merit exams and high grade point averages for admission to Lowell High School.<br />Named for 19th-century poet and abolitionist James Russell Lowell, the school is a nationally known beacon of excellence. Lowell is also among the 44 schools whose names the school board recently voted to change because Lowell’s references to African-Americans are regarded as insufficiently enlightened by today’s standards.<br />One school board commissioner, Alison Collins, has called merit-based admissions “racist.” The real problem progressives have with Lowell is that too many Asian-Americans are passing the entrance exam. But it’s perverse to penalize Asian-Americans because other children do less well on tests.<br />That’s especially true in a public school system that does such a poor job teaching children of color at most of its schools. Last year the nonprofit Brightbeam put out a report called “The Secret Shame: How America’s Most Progressive Cities Betray Their Commitment to Educational Opportunity for All.” The report says that in San Francisco “70% of white students are proficient in math, compared to only 12% of black students reaching proficiency—a 58-point gap.”<br />The underperformance of black and Latino children in so many American public schools should be a national scandal. Instead, the response from elite universities and New York City’s high-performing public schools has been to disguise the problem by setting de facto admissions quotas for Asian-American students no matter their superior qualifications.</td>

      <td>Biden made remarks about former president in CBS interview set to air on Sunday</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden said that former President Donald Trump shouldn’t have access to intelligence briefings due to his “erratic behavior unrelated to the insurrection.”<br />Mr. Biden told CBS Evening News with Norah O’Donnell that he saw no reason for his predecessor to get briefings, saying: “What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?”<br />CBS released excerpts of the interview, which will air in full Sunday, on Friday evening.<br />Representatives for Mr. Trump didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier this week that Mr. Biden’s national security team was looking into whether to extend intelligence briefings to Mr. Trump.</td>

      <td>Upstate district seat is last uncalled congressional contest of November election</td>
      <td>Republican Claudia Tenney should be certified as the winner of an upstate New York congressional seat, a judge ruled Friday, capping a court-supervised canvass and resolving the last uncalled race for the U.S. House of Representatives from 2020.<br />New York State Supreme Court Justice Scott DelConte said that Ms. Tenney received 156,098 votes compared with 155,989 for U.S. Rep. Anthony Brindisi, a Democrat from Utica who won the seat from Ms. Tenney in 2018. Justice DelConte ordered election officials to certify her victory.<br />In a statement, Ms. Tenney said every legal vote had been counted and she was honored to have won in New York’s 22nd congressional district, which stretches across eight counties from Pennsylvania to Lake Ontario through the cities of Binghamton and Utica.<br />“The voters need a voice in Congress, and I look forward to getting to work,” Ms. Tenney said.<br />On Friday, attorneys for the Democratic incumbent filed a notice to appeal recent decisions by Justice DelConte about which ballots were eligible to be counted. This week, Mr. Brindisi’s lawyers asked Justice DelConte to delay certifying the election until appeals were heard. They also moved for a manual audit of how votes were tabulated, citing small reporting errors, a request that Justice DelConte denied.</td>
