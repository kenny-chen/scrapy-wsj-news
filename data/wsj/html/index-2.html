It is limited to Hunter Biden and his business dealings and doesn’t implicate other members of his family or the president-elect, another person said.</td>

      <td>An exhibition at the Katonah Museum of Art spotlights ceramic works of the past century that speak to Japan’s traditional style and technique.</td>
      <td>Katonah, N.Y.<br />In Kato Tsubusa’s 3-foot-tall sculpture, “Object,” you can feel the ceramist stretching, slicing and pinching the thick slabs of white porcelaneous clay that rise into a soaring, ragged peak—and sense the slow pouring of pale celadon glaze so that it flows down the sides and pools at the base like melted snow. In Maeta Akihiro’s white porcelain pot, however, the artist’s hand is invisible. After shaping the small mouth, tapering the base, flaring and faceting the body, the artist ran a blade over the surface, erasing all traces of his fingers and palm. The result is a work whose heft and purity of form exude calm.<br />Such contrasts abound in “Hands & Earth: Perspectives on Japanese Contemporary Ceramics”—and so do affinities, subtle connections and jaw-dropping displays of mastery. Of the 35 ceramists featured, seven have been deemed Living National Treasures, many have received prestigious awards, and all have met with critical success.<br />This is not intended as a comprehensive overview of Japan’s ceramics scene. There’s no bling, no playfulness, no manga or anime imagery. That’s because the show, which originated at the Lowe Art Museum in Miami and is currently on view at the Katonah Museum of Art, draws its 41 works from the private collection of Carol and Jeffrey Horvitz, who have acquired ceramics they deem “clearly Japanese, clearly contemporary, and that spoke to a traditional style and technique in Japan,” as Mr. Horvitz states in the catalog. (The exhibition will travel to the University of Georgia on June 12, 2021, and the Crocker Museum on Jan. 22, 2022.)<br />A number of the artists come from a long line of potters, some stretching back to the late 16th century, when Koreans—captured by Japanese invading forces—revolutionized the field. They introduced porcelain production along with, among other things, kilns that allowed for more control during firings, a number of glazing techniques, and an appreciation for slight asymmetries and imperfections. This coincided with the codification of the tea ceremony, which prized rustic ceramics over the refined and polished wares adopted from China. In the 1920s, ceramists reprised this preference with the mingei, or folk craft, movement, whose influence comes through in a number of pieces as does an ongoing fascination with historical glazes and experiments with porcelain. The works span about eight decades starting in 1937, with almost half made between 2010 and 2016.</td>

      <td>A $30 million restoration of Houston’s Rothko Chapel features updated acoustics and lighting that showcase as never before the 14 canvases that line its walls.</td>
      <td>Houston<br />The Rothko Chapel is a windowless brick octagon, 48 feet in diameter, whose sole source of light is a central oculus. It is a somber chamber of shadows and the 14 paintings by Mark Rothko that surround it are themselves shadows, rectangles of black or deep plum. It ought to be as inviting as the bottom of a well. And yet it is unexpectedly uplifting, and it seems to speak not of despair and oblivion but of the human spirit in all its proud, frail dignity.<br />The chapel, which opened in February 1971, has just completed its $30 million restoration by the Architecture Research Office (ARO) of New York. That restoration is subtle to the point of invisibility. The walls have been strengthened, the entrance vestibule uncluttered, and the acoustics and lighting immeasurably improved, while Rothko’s paintings themselves were left untouched. As it happens, they are the principal beneficiaries of the restoration.<br />The idea of the chapel dates to 1964, when John and Dominique de Menil, Houston’s celebrated art patrons, visited Rothko’s New York studio. They saw there the murals that he created for the Four Seasons and famously refused to deliver to the restaurant, not wanting the “rich bastards” who were its customers to enjoy them. The Menils made him a better offer, to create a new cycle of paintings for a building where they would not be incidental decoration but the main point. They combined the commission with another of their projects, the gift of a chapel to Houston’s University of St. Thomas, whose art department Dominique then headed. Their architect was Philip Johnson, whose house for the Menils was one of his first realized buildings.<br />To the surprise of no one, Rothko and Johnson did not play well together. In 1967 the commission was taken from Johnson and given to Howard Barnstone and Gene Aubry, who executed his scheme with only minor modifications. The Menils and the university also parted ways, and in 1968, before construction began, their chapel became an independent institution that would be open to nondenominational use and private contemplation, and would also stress civil rights. Over the years it has happily accommodated every type of service, from Jewish weddings to Zoroastrian purification rites. This is the great paradox of the chapel, that a building and a cycle of paintings designed explicitly for Catholic worship should make everyone feel at home.</td>

      <td>U.S. authorities are scrutinizing the social-media giant’s acquisition history and how it selected its targets</td>
      <td>Facebook Inc.,  for the first time, is facing antitrust lawsuits in its home market. On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission and a group of attorneys general accused the Menlo Park, Calif., company of abusing its market position to squelch competition. The lawsuits scrutinize Facebook’s acquisition strategy and its motivations to buy companies such as WhatsApp and Instagram. Here’s a look at some of Facebook’s key deals.<br />Deal rationale: In April 2012, Facebook announced that it would buy Instagram for about $1 billion in cash and stock. (At closing, the deal’s value was $736 million.) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was nervous about a new crop of mobile-oriented social-media upstarts that were nibbling away at Facebook’s user base as consumers were shifting to mobile phones, an area where the company was weak.<br />What Facebook has done with it: Instagram has become one of the crown jewels in Facebook’s empire because of its rapid growth and a user base that is younger than that of its flagship Facebook app. The company has continued to add new features to move Instagram beyond photo sharing, and it has tightened the links between Instagram and Facebook through marketing as well as with technology.<br />Deal rationale: Facebook in 2013 reached a deal to buy Onavo for $120 million in a bid to sharpen its mobile analytics insights. Onavo, which had mobile utility apps, gave Facebook access to private data showing how apps were performing relative to others.<br />What Facebook has done with it: Onavo data was used to help Facebook determine whether to buy WhatsApp in 2014, Mr. Zuckerberg said during a congressional hearing this year. Onavo also helped Facebook track other rivals and examine new product categories, people familiar with the product have said.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Shareholders of  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  that dispute the U.S. government’s decision to sequester the mortgage giants’ profits finally got a hearing before the Supreme Court. They were met with a skeptical reception Wednesday.<br />The case arises from the government’s 2012 decision to channel nearly all of Fannie and Freddie’s profits to the Treasury Department, a bid to reclaim more quickly taxpayer dollars that kept the firms afloat after they were bailed out during the 2008 financial crisis.<br />Shareholders argued that the profit sweep should be invalidated because the firms’ regulator—the Federal Housing Finance Agency—is structured unconstitutionally, with a single director who holds power that isn’t subject to appropriate checks by the president.<br />The Supreme Court agreed with similar arguments in a June decision that ordered a restructuring of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.<br />The case could have broad implications for the housing market, because the firms guarantee about half of the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage market. Fannie and Freddie make money by collecting fees on those guarantees. All told, they have sent more than $300 billion back to the government, compared with the roughly $190 billion it injected into the firms.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Federal Trade Commission and a bipartisan group of 46 states filed broad antitrust lawsuits against  Facebook Inc.  on Wednesday, alleging the social-media giant engaged in a yearslong campaign to buy up or freeze out nascent technology companies that one day might have become rivals.<br />The FTC’s case is its most ambitious in recent memory and seeks to unwind Facebook’s prior acquisitions of the photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp. It comes just weeks after the Justice Department brought an antitrust lawsuit targeting Google’s flagship search business. Each federal agency now has its own once-in-a-generation case at the same time, a signal of the level of U.S. concern about the power of dominant online platforms.<br />The FTC, on a 3-2 vote, filed the case in a Washington, D.C., federal court after an investigation that stretched more than a year. Commission staffers had been preparing the lawsuit for months and recommended that the FTC vote to bring a case.<br />“Personal social networking is central to the lives of millions of Americans,” said Ian Conner, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Facebook’s actions to entrench and maintain its monopoly deny consumers the benefits of competition. Our aim is to roll back Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition so that innovation and free competition can thrive.”<br />New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James announced the states’ lawsuit, which includes the District of Columbia and Guam. It was also filed in Washington, D.C.</td>

Revenue and orders at DoorDash more than tripled this summer and fall, compared with the year before, as consumers tired of prepping food at home and ordered more meals for delivery.<br />The result led the company’s valuation to jump to roughly $71.8 billion, as of the close Wednesday, from $15 billion earlier in the year.<br />Founded in 2013 by Tony Xu, who emigrated from China with his parents when he was five years old, DoorDash now must defend its nearly 50% U.S, market share in the competitive food-delivery industry and stoke further growth to satisfy heightened shareholder expectations. The company believes the ease by which diners can get food delivered won’t be a fad, but demand could slow as vaccines for the coronavirus are distributed and patrons return to restaurant dining rooms they have been avoiding.</td>

Wall Street banks and electronic trading firms use such data to predict short-term price moves and ensure that they get good prices when buying or selling stocks.<br />Another part of the SEC’s plan allows upstart versions of the SIPs to compete with the existing feeds, which are operated by the New York Stock Exchange and  Nasdaq Inc.<br />Together, the measures amount to one of the biggest overhauls of the SIPs since the rules governing them were passed in the 1970s. They are also a parting shot by departing SEC Chairman Jay Clayton at big stock-exchange operators that have challenged a number of commission rules during his term.<br />The SEC’s commissioners voted unanimously Wednesday to implement the plan despite opposition from the exchange operators, which could lose lucrative data revenue if the changes spur their customers to ditch their premium data feeds for the cheaper SIPs.</td>

      <td>Food company benefits from an embrace of its namesake condensed soups by millennials who previously shunned them</td>
      <td>Campbell Soup  is back, led by an unlikely champion—its original condensed soups. Now it needs to show it can make those gains stick.<br />The company reported solid results Wednesday. Its net sales rose 7% from a year earlier in the three months to Nov. 1, while adjusted earnings before interest and taxes jumped 18%. U.S. soup sales rose 21% in the quarter. Granted, that is down from 52% growth in the prior quarter, but that was during the summer months. The substantial rise seen in the fall bodes well for peak soup season this winter.<br />Chief Executive Mark Clouse, who took over in January 2019, has often stressed the need to update the soup lineup for contemporary tastes, such as with bone broths and plant-based offerings. So it was somewhat surprising to hear him say Wednesday that Campbell’s stodgy condensed soups were “the hero” in the latest quarter.<br />This was apparently due to increased use for cooking. Families stuck at home during the pandemic are looking for quick and affordable ways to put dinner on the table. Views of Campbell’s website recipes were up 20% from a year earlier in the quarter, Mr. Clouse said. Millennials showed the biggest increase in purchases and repeat purchases of any demographic, he added.<br />Campbell shares, nonetheless, were down 2% Wednesday. Investors might have been disappointed with the company’s guidance for the current quarter of 5% to 7% net sales growth and the same pace in adjusted Ebit. This suggests last quarter’s margin expansion won’t be repeated. But executives said this was partly due to increased marketing planned for the crucial winter quarter.</td>

      <td>Before Beltway politicians sign off on another trillion-dollar stimulus plan, they might want to ponder how the earlier trillions spent by Congress and created by the Federal Reserve are still sloshing through the economy. Covid restrictions from state and local politicians have disrupted the ability of many workers to earn a living, but today’s market action shows there are a few big winners, too. When people are ordered to stay home, they still want to eat.<br />The Journal’s Micah Maidenberg reports:<br />It’s not a knock on the San Francisco-based company led by founder Tony Xu to say that DoorDash was in the right place at the right time when politicians started pumping cash into the economy while closing restaurant dining rooms. DoorDash has achieved the largest share of a competitive U.S. market in food-delivery services. Whether companies are delivering food or anything else, it’s a great time to raise money in capital markets turbo-charged by Washington. But it’s especially good to be doing food delivery in the year of social distancing. Mr. Maidenberg explains:<br />Yet DoorDash has never posted a full-year profit. Investors are so eager to part with their money that many aren’t even demanding a say in how their company will be run:<br />Again, DoorDash is in a sweet spot but the money is easy for all kinds of companies these days whether they are raising equity or debt. Banks are full of cash and so are non-financial companies. All politicians have to do is allow them to lend and invest it--unless the pols would prefer to keep picking lockdown losers along with a few wealthy winners.</td>

      <td>Canada became the third country to authorize use of the Covid-19 vaccine produced by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech  SE, racing ahead of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Europe’s main regulator to approve shots for its most vulnerable citizens.<br />Canada will now begin its immunization rollout as early as next week—a daunting challenge for a sparsely populated country with the world’s second-largest territory. The country is on schedule to begin inoculations next week, with a portfolio of vaccine candidates that it argues is among the most diverse among large economies.<br />The F.D.A. is expected to authorize use of the vaccine as early as this weekend, after its own study concluded the two-dose vaccine provided benefits even after just the first injection—cutting the risk of getting Covid-19 by about half. The vaccine was found to be 95% effective after the second dose. The European Medicines Agency has said a decision on either the Pfizer-BioNTech shot or  Moderna Inc.’s  vaccine could come by the end of this month.<br />The U.K. and Bahrain approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine within the past week. Canadian officials said Wednesday they expected to soon issue a decision regarding the Moderna vaccine.<br />“We are not in a race with any other regulator. What we are trying to do is beat this virus,” said Supriya Sharma, senior medical adviser at Canada’s health department. “We expedited the review, but we did not compromise in terms of the safety, efficacy and quality.”</td>

      <td>Investors seem unduly relaxed about a lovers’ spat between IAC and Alphabet’s Google</td>
      <td>Investors new to the  IAC/InterActiveCorp.  story probably know it as a company that kindled online romance through now-independent  Match Group Inc.  They seem unduly relaxed about a lovers’ spat with  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google.<br />On Sunday a Wall Street Journal article brought to light the story of a yearslong relationship between the technology holding company and the search giant that appears more controversial than symbiotic. News emerged this week that Google is mulling penalties against IAC for what one of its internal trust-and-safety teams has deemed misleading practices of some of IAC’s browser extensions. Google could go so far as to ban IAC’s products from its Chrome extensions entirely, according to the Journal’s report, which notes IAC believed such a move would “devastate” a key part of its business.<br />Investors took the news in stride when they saw how little appears to be at risk. While IAC earns money from Google’s ads served in the results across its own search engine MyWay, its browser extension, or Desktop business, accounted for less than a third of its total Search revenue and for only about 5% of its overall revenue in the third quarter. Furthermore, IAC says profit from its Desktop business has fallen nearly 90% over the past three years. Much of that loss seems to be because of changes to how Google syndicates its apps. That business, in other words, already was sinking.<br />But Google’s relationship with IAC goes well beyond browser extensions. According to a proxy statement filed by IAC in April, Google accounted for 27% of IAC’s total revenue last year excluding Match Group. IAC’s third-quarter filing, in which Google appears 35 times, includes nearly an entire page dedicated to its services agreement with Google, noting that it constitutes a “meaningful portion” of its revenue. It also makes clear that IAC earns other advertising revenue from Google outside of that agreement.<br />In other words, Google’s relationship is highly valuable to IAC. But it also appears to be ebbing. IAC’s proxy filing also notes that its business with Google has been declining on the same basis since at least 2017, when it was 38% of its overall revenue. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, Google’s business had shrunk to just 17% of IAC’s combined revenue.</td>

      <td>Alphabet Inc.’s  Google said it is planning to lift its ban on political ads on Thursday after a blackout of more than a month because of concerns over election misinformation.<br />Google told advertisers Wednesday it will lift its so-called sensitive event policy and allow ads that mention a current state or federal officeholder or candidate, political party or ballot measure, according to an email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Early voting in the Georgia Senate runoffs begins later this month. The Georgia runoffs on Jan. 5 will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate when President-elect Joe Biden begins his administration.<br />“While we no longer consider the postelection period to be a sensitive event, we will still rigorously enforce our ads policies, which strictly prohibit demonstrably false information that could significantly undermine trust in elections or the democratic process, among other forms of abuse,” Google said in the email.<br />Google, along with  Facebook Inc.,  are the biggest digital ad platforms in political advertising. Political campaigns and groups spent tens of millions of dollars advertising on Google, which owns YouTube, and on Facebook, which also owns Instagram, leading up to the general election to influence voters and get out the vote. But both platforms decided to limit political ads before and after the general election in an effort to tamp down the spread of misinformation.<br />Google said Wednesday in a blog post that it temporarily paused more than 5 million ads referencing the U.S. 2020 election, the candidates, or its outcome as election results were certified.</td>

      <td>On a hunch that this year might be a uniquely fruitful one for finding deals, our wine columnist stalked the aisles at Costco. Here, the best values she flushed out.</td>
      <td>“WE DON’T HAVE any more wine Advent calendars!” said a harried Costco staffer as he rushed by me. I’d just set foot in the Wayne, N.J., Costco, and he’d overheard me say “wine” to my husband.<br />The Costco Advent calendar contains 24 half bottles of various wines and sells for under just $100—if you can find it. Neither wine nor desirable bottles last long on Costco shelves. The tantalizing promise of a find might end in disappointment—or a great bottle of wine. Siobhan Clements, Costco’s northeast re-gional beer, wine and spirits buyer, calls this “the Costco treasure hunt.” The payoff might be a small-production Pinot Noir or Costco’s own sought-after Kirkland-label Rutherford Napa Valley Cabernet.<br />I’ve written about wine shopping at Costco before, but I had particularly high hopes when I undertook my most recent visits to the store. The pandemic has compelled producers to redirect wines destined for restaurants and hotels to retailers instead. Might some of those gems have landed at Costco?<br />According to Chad Sokol, assistant vice president and general merchandise manager for Costco Wine & Spirits, there are both corporate and regional Costco wine, spirit and beer buyers across the country. The northeast region Ms. Clements oversees includes nine states and 35 stores that sell wine (about 80% of all Costcos do), including the Wayne store where I shopped this month.<br />“Some of the brands have been nice surprises, and we’ve been able to get some really good deals,” Ms. Clements said. For example, she had secured a few cases of 2018 Austin Hope Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon, a wine that earned high marks from critics. She couldn’t tell me where all the “deals” ended up, but she did say the Austin Hope wine was in some New Jersey stores.</td>

The current wave by some measures is worse, but markets have barely shrugged.<br />Partly that’s because with effective vaccines headed for approval, the end of the pandemic is in sight. But it also is because governments have tried to apply the lessons of the spring by imposing shorter and less stringent restrictions, or none at all. The economic hit has thus been smaller and more manageable.<br />“We’ve learned a whole lot in terms of how to deal with this pandemic,” Gita Gopinath, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said in an interview Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual summit.<br />She said the virus is being attacked “in a more targeted way”— Lockdowns are reserved for where cases are growing exponentially; higher-risk settings such as restaurants and bars are subject to limitations; and schools, which have proven relatively safe, stay open for the most part.<br />Still, targeted restrictions in Europe haven’t brought infections down as far as in the spring. The U.S. has yet to suffer much economic setback from its current wave, but its limited restrictions have yet to reverse the rise in infections.</td>

All three airlines said in August that they would permanently end flight-change fees for domestic flights.<br />The moves to eliminate the fees, which start at $200 but can run much higher, are an indication of the lengths carriers will go to reassure passengers and compete for their business as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage travel demand. Restoring international travel is a priority for the airline industry, which has lost billions of dollars since the pandemic began.<br />Change fees, long been a pet peeve for passengers, have been lucrative for airlines based in the U.S. The charges brought in $2.8 billion last year, according to the federal Department of Transportation. But executives have said they believe travelers will place more value on flexibility once they return to the skies.<br />Air-travel demand plunged as Covid-19 spread this year and has only partially recovered. International travel has been hardest hit, as government travel restrictions and quarantine requirements have made such trips difficult or impossible. The number of domestic passengers in October fell 60% from a year earlier, while international travelers declined 77%, according to the latest government figures.</td>

Prices for the haven metal are still up more than 3% so far in December but remain more than 10% below their record high in August, hurt by a broad rally in stocks and riskier commodities with investor anxiety fading after the U.S. election.<br />Gold is still up more than 20% for the year, making it one of the better-performing major assets in 2020. Investors tend to buy the metal when they are nervous about the outlook for the global economy or geopolitical events like elections. That trend boosted demand earlier in the year, before Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential race and key Republican wins in Senate races combined with hopeful vaccine news to send prices tumbling in November.<br />Traders had anticipated that a “blue-wave” scenario in which Mr. Biden won the presidential election and Democrats won control of the Senate would boost gold by unleashing much larger stimulus programs on the economy. Investors also use the metal to protect against rising inflation and a weakening dollar, so that scenario was seen as more positive for bullion.<br />Instead, Republicans performed better than many analysts expected, meaning control of the Senate will come down to a pair of runoff elections in Georgia next month. Investors are parsing those races, a rise in coronavirus cases and ongoing stimulus discussions in Washington as gold’s swings continue.</td>

Lately, many of my correspondents want to know which three-ton super-SUV behemoth I would recommend? Um, none. It’s my duty to observe that the supersizing of the U.S. private fleet represents a public health threat and a failure of regulatory and tax policy (I’m looking at you, Section 179 of the IRS Code). On average and at the extreme, SUVs and trucks have gotten too big, too wasteful and there are too many on the road. Don’t buy one.<br />See?

If these readers are able to charge at home, I advise them to immediately Pass Go, buy a Tesla, and join the 21st century. Otherwise, the usual suspects include  BMW  5 Series,  Mercedes-Benz  E-Class, Lexus GS, Cadillac CT5 and Audi A6.<br />I’m answering all those letters at once. If I were spending my money—the most valuable kind—I’d probably buy the 2021 Genesis G80. And then you write back to say, “The wha…?” Allow me.<br />Genesis is the premium-luxury division of Hyundai, the Korean version of Toyota’s Lexus. For we grizzled veterans of the industry, this is the latest chapter in a story dating back to 2008. Hyundai has struggled to establish luxury credibility in Western markets. These efforts have often been undone by awkward whole-vehicle designs, says I; flagship cars that aspired to look glamorous—lots of brightwork, formal styling—but presented as just a bit naive. The bang-for-buck of cars like the G90 Limousine was undeniable. The warranty coverage was unbeatable. The pride of ownership was just not there.</td>

Hours later, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin presented a new $916 billion White House proposal to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) that included both state and local funding, as well as liability protections, but dropped the $300 a week in enhanced unemployment insurance and put in $600 direct checks to many Americans.</td>

      <td>China’s consumer prices dropped for the first time in over a decade in November, though economists say the decrease doesn’t signal faltering demand in the world’s second-largest economy.<br />The fall was driven by volatile food prices, including the continued retreat of pork prices as supply recovers from the ravages of African swine fever. Other economic indicators have shown a continued recovery from Covid-19 shocks.<br />China’s consumer-price index in November was down 0.5% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday, after a 0.5% rise in October. It was the first negative reading since October 2009. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast November’s CPI would come in flat.<br />The statistics bureau said food prices, down 2.0% from a year earlier, weighed heavily on November’s headline CPI. In October, food prices were up 2.2% from a year earlier.<br />Among foods, pork—the main source of protein in the Chinese diet—extended its decline, down 12.5% in November after October’s 2.8% drop.</td>

      <td>The U.S. is in danger of losing its dominant leadership position in global financial services.</td>
      <td>The U.S. remains the dominant force in the financial-services industry, leading in nearly every area of finance, from venture capital and private equity to banking and asset management. The liquidity and scale of U.S. capital markets support the primacy of the dollar, which allows Americans to pay less for foreign goods and helps finance U.S. government spending. America’s financial leadership, however, is increasingly being challenged by fierce competition from abroad and by shortsighted and counterproductive policies at home. Maintaining U.S. financial pre-eminence should be a priority for the Biden administration.<br />Traditionally, challenges to American leadership have come from well-established financial centers like London, Hong Kong and Tokyo. But mainland China will be an increasingly formidable challenger in financial services in the next few years.<br />The last-minute cancellation last month of Ant Group’s planned initial public offering—which would have been the largest in history, raising some $34 billion—reminded many investors about the risks of the Chinese market. But the deal’s size also showed China’s ability to attract massive amounts of capital. Despite the stumble, China’s domestic exchanges are well-positioned for the future.<br />China lags behind the advanced financial centers, but it has belatedly begun to open up and attract best-in-class foreign financial institutions. Its markets have governance and accounting issues to overcome, but Beijing is working to enhance its regulatory structure to meet global standards and provide greater transparency and better enforcement. China’s relatively quick recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic without a major fiscal stimulus has also allowed it to maintain higher interest rates and a stronger currency. This is attracting large investment inflows to Chinese stocks and other securities. Shanghai ranked first among global exchanges for number of IPOs and capital raised through the first nine months of 2020. These IPOs show that major fundraising can take place outside the U.S. financial ecosystem.<br />At the same time China is working to attract global capital, the U.S. is moving in the opposite direction. Ultimately, the strength of America’s capital markets rests on trust in the country’s stable macroeconomic and fiscal policies, and in the resilience of its open political system.</td>

      <td>Think U.S. lockdowns are bad? Imagine being confined to your town.</td>
      <td>Milan<br />If U.S. states’ lockdowns are too onerous for you, be thankful you’re not in Italy. In November Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte promised that “if we respect the rules, we’ll have a serene Christmas.” Italians largely complied but didn’t get their reward. Now Mr. Conte says it’ll be “a different Christmas, but not less authentic.”<br />Covid-19 hit Italy early and hard. With more than 60,000 deaths and a case-fatality rate of 3.5% (compared with 1.95% in the U.S., 2.57% in Sweden and 2.4% in France), it is clearly a country where things went wrong. In the spring, when the epidemic was concentrated in the North, the country implemented the strictest lockdown in the Western world. It seemed to succeed, and Italians had an uneasy summer, with enclaves of normalcy. Some went to the beach; some hiked mountains; some even went clubbing. In October infections began to rise again.<br />The government fears that Christmas festivities will spread the virus, so it is imposing severe travel restrictions. Residents already aren’t free to move through the national territory, a constitutional right in Italy as in any liberal democracy. They may travel only within their regions—Italy has 20 of them—or between regions that are classified as having a similar risk status. On Dec. 25 and 26 and Jan. 1, all Italians will be confined to their municipalities.<br />The rationale for the new measures lies in the fear that people may move out of the larger cities to join their relatives and have large gatherings, therefore causing a new infection spike. Attilio Fontana, governor of the Northern region of Lombardy, cautioned against a new “exodus” to the South, as the descendants of migrants make their customary reunions in their places of origin. As Southern health care is weaker when it comes to intensive-care units, there is reason to worry.</td>

      <td>The high-concept premise of Showtime’s new television drama “Your Honor” was made in Israel. The 10-part show, which premiered Dec. 6, stars Bryan Cranston as a spotless New Orleans judge who betrays his ethical code by covering up a hit-and-run involving his son.<br />Alon Aranya, an executive producer on “Your Honor,” helped shepherd the series to American TV. He says the original Israeli version, “Kvodo,” was made for a fraction of what the U.S. version cost and that its remake rights have also been sold to India, France, Russia, Germany and Italy.<br />Mr. Aranya, 49, has executive produced several U.S. television remakes of popular Israeli shows, including the CBS series “Hostages” (2013-14) about a doctor whose family is taken hostage as she is about to perform an operation on the U.S. president, which he also co-wrote. However he says his focus has become more international since 2017 when he set up his company Paper Plane Productions with offices in Los Angeles, Tel Aviv and the Netherlands.<br />Earlier this year, Paper Plane co-produced “Tehran,” which became AppleTV+’s first international show. The 8-part espionage thriller shot mostly in Farsi was co-written by “Fauda” screenwriter Moshe Zonder. Since its September premiere Messrs. Zonda and Aranya each signed first-look development deals with AppleTV+.<br />Mr. Aranya spoke to the WSJ about picking winners and the inherent jeopardy in Israeli dramas.

      <td>Limited supply of new Xbox and PlayStation consoles will slow retailer’s reboot</td>
      <td>GameStop ’s  race to slim down has seen some success. But investors binged too early on a complicated recovery story.<br />The videogame retailer posted disappointing third-quarter results late Tuesday. Revenue for the quarter ended Oct. 31 slid 30% year over year to just over $1 billion—about 7% short of Wall Street’s estimates. Moreover, the company declined to give a forecast for the current period, which should be a strong one given the launch of new Xbox and PlayStation consoles in early November. GameStop’s share price slumped more than 17% Wednesday morning.<br />Those consoles come at a crucial time for the struggling retailer. Once the pre-eminent destination for videogame products, GameStop’s business has been severely disrupted by the rapid digitization of the industry. Analysts estimate that anywhere from a third to half of all games sold now are digital downloads. That limits GameStop’s ability to get a piece of the initial sale, as many of those sales are by the publisher directly or on console-based platforms such as Xbox Live. That also cuts down on future sales of preowned games—historically GameStop’s largest source of profits.<br />Hence, game hardware such as consoles and related equipment have become key to getting customers into GameStop’s shrinking store base. But the consoles themselves are very hard to get right now, as booming demand has met limited supply. Retailers are sold out everywhere, and the black market is booming.  Sony ’s  PlayStation 5 is currently fetching about $2,000 on  eBay —four times its retail price. GameStop Chief Executive Officer George Sherman predicted Tuesday on GameStop’s earnings call that the new consoles will generate “great carryforward demand into the entirety of next year and beyond.”<br />But GameStop’s share price had nearly tripled for the year heading into yesterday’s report, as investors have been anticipating a big recovery in sales led by the new machines. The stock is also a favorite target of short sellers, adding to its volatility. As a retailer with a red-hot product, GameStop should have its merriest Christmas in years. But failure to get enough of the new consoles on its shelves could still leave a lump of coal for investors.</td>

IV ,  a blank-check company run by former banker Michael Klein, and private-equity firm TPG, the people said.  Apollo Global Management Inc.,  long seen by many as the front-runner to buy DirecTV, submitted a bid valuing the business at less than $15 billion, some of the people said.<br />The auction is in a late stage and should the company reach a deal with one of the suitors, it could be completed by early next year.<br />A deal could allow AT&T to deconsolidate DirecTV’s worsening financial results—a major aim of the transaction—while relinquishing control even as it maintains a majority stake in the business.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported in August that AT&T had tapped bankers to explore a deal to take the fast-shrinking business off its books. The media-and-telecom company bought DirecTV in 2015 for about $49 billion, or $66 billion including debt. (Its Latin American satellite business, also acquired through the DirecTV takeover, is now held in a separate unit called Vrio.)</td>

      <td>A longtime devotee of the celebrated globe-trotter on her remarkable life and career</td>
      <td>IN 2003, I was handed my first assignment as a fledgling public-radio producer: editing an interview for a program called “The Savvy Traveler.” It was a conversation between the show’s host, Diana Nyad, and celebrated British journalist, historian and travel writer Jan Morris. It took me days. Partly because I’d never used audio-editing software before. But mainly because the raw tape was so enthralling I couldn’t bear to cut anything out.<br />Morris, who died on Nov. 20 of this year, talked about how, at age 26, she joined the 1953 expedition that first summited Mount Everest—the only reporter on the team. When Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the peak, Morris was determined to send word back to Britain quickly and secretly, to avoid getting scooped. That required her to scramble 22,000 feet down the mountain in growing darkness, and then find a sherpa to speed a coded message 20 miles south, to the nearest village with a long-distance radio. The exclusive hit the London Times on the eve of Elizabeth II’s coronation. Brits danced in the streets at the news. That was just the beginning of Jan Morris’s career.<br />She went on to write innumerable articles and travelogues about innumerable countries, always seeming to touch down at exactly the moment a place became incredibly interesting. She toured the U.S. in its post-World War II heyday. She visited Cuba just after the revolution (“This sugar and bikini state,” she marveled, “has lurched so far from the American ideal that people can seriously talk of it as a potential Russian satellite”). As for her favorite place, Venice—“that paragon among landfalls”—she never needed an excuse to visit, documenting it repeatedly down to the last detail. Of all her travel books, she told Diana Nyad, her favorite was “A Venetian Bestiary,” a slim volume cataloging the city’s smattering of animal life, from alley cats to the winged lion statue in Piazza San Marco.<br />She traveled nearly everywhere and was paid to write about what she saw. The story of her most personal journey—transitioning, in her late 30s, from her assigned male gender to female—became a groundbreaking memoir (1974’s “Conundrum”). In short, hers was the kind of life and career that newbie journalists like me aspired to. As soon as I finished cutting Morris’s Savvy Traveler interview, I swiped the show’s copy of her essay compendium “The World: Travels 1950-2000,” eager to be swept away by trenchant tales of her globe-trotting adventures.<br />But the essay in the book that really stuck with me hit far closer to home. I was surprised to discover Morris had even bothered to write about my adopted hometown of Los Angeles. I figured a lover of Venice would find L.A. a comparatively ugly, shallow snooze. And according to Morris, when she first visited in 1954, that was in fact her general impression. “I had introductions, then, to the Hollywood film community,” she writes, “But had gone away thinking it was a rather silly and superficial place.”</td>

      <td>Some Asian countries that have been among the world’s most successful at containing Covid-19 are now struggling to beat back a winter resurgence, a sign of how elusive sustained progress can be until a vaccine gets rolled out widely.<br />On Wednesday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in convened an emergency meeting after the country saw a nine-month peak of 686 cases that has forced officials to use shipping containers to address a hospital-bed shortage. Japan on Wednesday recorded more than 2,800 new cases, according to public broadcaster NHK, its highest daily total yet.<br />Vietnam reported community infections for the first time in around three months, prompting authorities to suspend all inbound commercial flights. Hong Kong, which had taken daily infections down to single digits, has seen cases surge past 100, requiring the reintroduction of limits on dine-in restaurant service and gym closures. Several regions of Malaysia went into lockdown after cases doubled within a month.<br />“We have overcome coronavirus crises several times but now we are in a more serious situation than ever,” said Mr. Moon, during a meeting with officials earlier this week. He called for expanded coronavirus testing, prompting testing sites to extend working hours and reopen drive-through sites.<br />Though the virus tallies pale in comparison with the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, the uptick in outbreaks among Asia’s Covid-19 success stories comes after life had been restored to pre-pandemic levels. But unlike more isolated outbreaks of prior months, this winter upturn is more diffuse, as places once considered havens—a family gathering at home or work sites long reopened—are now the outbreak origins.</td>

The 2019-20 season only finished in late September after being interrupted in March.<br />To get moving again, the league needs about a three-week ramp up to allow players to quarantine upon repatriating to their home markets and then participate in training camps, according to people familiar with the matter.

However, that was less than half the gains Campbell reported for the prior three months.

He said some people have become better cooks and that some will likely continue working more from home long-term.<br />“We do not see this as a kind of episodic moment,” he said on a call with investors.<br />The pandemic has provided food makers with an unprecedented opportunity for millions of people to try their products for the first time in years. Like other food makers, Campbell has invested in more advertising to try to maintain the momentum. The company said many of its new customers are young people returning to its soup and snacks.</td>

      <td>And who can fault her when no other EU leader has a better idea?</td>
      <td>Mario Draghi’s rubric during his presidency of the European Central Bank was “whatever it takes.” His successor Christine Lagarde has been forced to adopt a different version: “whatever we can.” That’s the best read on the expansion of pandemic bond purchases likely to be announced Thursday.<br />The Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, PEPP, was born in March and has expanded to a €1.35 trillion quantitative-easing program under which the ECB commits to buy government and corporate bonds at least through June 2021. It’s also the only eurozone-wide response to the pandemic that’s made it past the starting line. A Brussels plan for €750 billion in spending on welfare and public works is bogged down in political wrangling.<br />Absent action from other political leaders, it’s back to Frankfurt for more help. Investors expect an expansion in monetary aid this week—maybe another €500 billion—and an extension into 2022.<br />Don’t ask what practical effect this might have, because the answer is not much. The ECB already isn’t on track to fully implement PEPP as it is. At the current pace of monthly purchases, it would have money left over when the program is due to expire in June.<br />Nor is Europe suffering a financial panic. Ms. Lagarde, with her peers at the world’s other major central banks, performed her most important function in the spring when ECB action prevented the virus contagion from spreading to the financial system. Interest rates have since gone into lockdown. Yields on government bonds have turned negative even in such fiscal laggards as Portugal, and Italy is near historic lows.</td>

In San Mateo County, where Facebook is based, 30% of the area median income is $52,200 for a family of four, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.<br />“This is extremely low-income housing, which is a particularly acute need during the Covid crisis and also an area which has suffered a lot from the underbuilding that we’ve had in California over the past several decades,” said David Wehner, Facebook’s chief financial officer.<br />This investment represents the latest details from Facebook, which in October last year said it was providing $1 billion to help ease a shortage of affordable housing in Silicon Valley.

      <td>Star power of dictator’s sister has risen after appearances at 2018 Winter Olympics, two nuclear summits and as a signatory in state media</td>
      <td>Kim Yo Jong, 32 years old, is a senior North Korean official helping oversee the country’s policies toward the U.S. and South Korea, according to Seoul’s intelligence agency.<br />She is a full member of North Korea’s Politburo and often at her brother’s side during key events in the one-party state. Among her various titles, Ms. Kim is the nominal head of the North’s propaganda and agitation department. She rose to prominence in just the past several years, attending all three face-to-face meetings between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as the latter’s confidante and adviser.<br />In 2020, she began signing off on official government statements that criticized Washington’s insistence on complete denuclearization of her country, and Seoul’s failure to rein in North Korean defectors who sent antiregime leaflets over the two Koreas’ shared border.<br />Kim Yo Jong’s precise date of birth is unknown, though South Korea’s Unification Ministry database of North Korean officials lists her as being born in 1988 in Pyongyang. She is the younger sister of Kim Jong Un and the youngest-known daughter of their father Kim Jong Il, who ruled North Korea from 1994 to 2011 and had children with several women. During her earliest years, Ms. Kim was an obscure figure. But that changed in 2009, when Kim Jong Un was rumored to have been named heir to the North Korean leadership, after their father suffered a series of strokes. That year, a side-by-side photograph was shown on state media, showing a presumed image of her, alongside Kim Jong Un and their eldest full brother, Kim Jong Chol. News cameras also spotted her in early 2011, when she attended an Eric Clapton concert in Singapore with Jong Chol.<br />Her marital status is unknown, though some South Korean news outlets have mentioned she may have married the son of a prominent North Korean official, Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Jong Un’s deputy in the state affairs commission—the government’s most-powerful decision-making apparatus. She hasn’t been publicly seen with a husband in North Korean state media. Ms. Kim steadily gained international prominence as Kim Jong Un accelerated North Korea’s nuclear weapons development over the past decade, participating in nuclear negotiations involving the U.S. and South Korea since 2018. In 2020, when her brother was rumored to be seriously ill, North Korea experts mentioned her as a possible emergency backup, if her brother abruptly died, or was incapacitated.</td>

      <td>The lesson is clear: No matter the obstacles, there will always be people (and cargo) who will fly.<br />Airlines have added a number of very long international flights to schedules in December, a sign of resilience and necessity in air travel. Some of the new flights are a result of increased holiday travel and cargo demand in key cities. Many will have small passenger loads—30 or 40 people on a wide-body jet. But with the right cargo load, that’s enough to at least break even on many trips, airlines say.<br />That also could mean nine, 12, even 18 hours in an enclosed space in the middle of the pandemic, a choice many would-be fliers have avoided. Robust ventilation and air filtration in cabins does reduce, but not eliminate, viral transmission risk. Even with the risks, quarantines and restrictions, the increased flying just shows that there will always be people who need to go.<br />“Air service is critical. People want to travel—even with a 14-day quarantine, even with all the testing—and these vital travel lanes are key to having those connections,’’ says Patrick Quayle, vice president of international network and alliances at United.<br />The number of scheduled passenger flights at least 3,400 miles long—New York-London is 3,451 miles—jumped 23% to 32,317 world-wide in December compared with November, according to Cirium, an aviation data company. December schedules still had 70% fewer flights than December 2019, but the number of flights scheduled was three times as many as the May low for long-haul international trips.</td>

Health Ministry didn’t disclose how many trial participants developed Covid-19 and how many of those received a placebo or a vaccine. It also wasn’t known whether the data was peer reviewed.<br />The results were the first from Phase 3 trials of a Chinese Covid-19 vaccine. Nearly one million Chinese people have already received the shot, which was developed by state-owned drugmaker Sinopharm, after the government granted emergency-use authorization for it in July.<br />Public-health experts said that the headline figure suggested that the world had another working vaccine option, although more details were needed. Some questioned why Sinopharm hadn’t jointly presented the results.</td>

      <td>When oil prices went negative during coronavirus lockdowns, the trading giant had its busiest month ever</td>
      <td>Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd., one of the world’s largest commodities traders, posted a record profit Wednesday, making it a big winner from turmoil in crude-oil markets during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The closely held company, which is based in Singapore but run from Geneva, almost doubled its net profit to $1.6 billion in the fiscal year ended September. The company’s operating earnings were the best in its 27-year history, it said.<br />Trafigura’s record windfall highlights the ability of commodity traders to thrive when prices gyrate. Like rivals Vitol Group and Gunvor Group, the company looks to profit whether commodity prices go up or down. Rather than owning mines and wells, it focuses on physical trading of commodities, arbitraging prices for the likes of crude or copper in different parts of the globe.<br />Trafigura did particularly well when oil prices went negative in the spring, despite a concurrent pullback in financing from banks for commodities deals. Demand for crude in cars and planes plummeted with much of the world economy in lockdown, while Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the world’s biggest crude producers, launched a crushing price war.<br />“We had our busiest period in April—our busiest month ever,” said Trafigura Chief Executive Jeremy Weir in a video that accompanied the company’s earnings release. “It was a stunning year,” he said, adding that the company boosted its gross profit margins to 5% from 1.6% last year. While not publicly listed, Trafigura posts financial results for bondholders.</td>

At first loosely regulated, they were seen as a financial innovation serving parts of the Chinese financial system that were ignored by state-backed banks. But a wave of scandals and defaults in 2018 prompted authorities to crack down.<br />At one point, China had more than 5,000 peer-to-peer lenders in operation, said Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, and annual transaction volume totaling the equivalent of about $459 billion.<br />“While they were originally positioned as financial-information intermediaries, the vast majority of them have in fact carried out credit and wealth-management business,” he said Tuesday at the Singapore Fintech Festival.<br />However, Mr. Guo added: “We have continued to clean up and consolidate, and by mid-November the actual operating P2P lenders had all been zeroed out.” As of June, previous official statistics showed 29 were still operating.</td>

It meets regularly to review flu vaccines and occasionally on experimental vaccines.<br />On Thursday, 23 members of that committee will evaluate the first among what public health experts say eventually could be a suite of vaccines to help turn the tide of the global coronavirus pandemic, which has killed over 1.5 million people world-wide, according to Johns Hopkins University.<br />The advisory panel will play a key role in the FDA’s review.

They also urged Rio Tinto and its western Australian peers to end the use of gag clauses in land-use agreements that have stopped Aboriginal groups from speaking out against mining operations.<br />The inquiry has the potential to reboot the relationship between indigenous communities and miners, which rank among Australia’s biggest companies.<br />Globally, many mining operations are on land traditionally owned by indigenous groups, including in South America, Africa and the Arctic Circle.

Study after study shows that women aren’t engaging enough with their finances. The financial-services industry is still falling short in serving this half of the population.

      <td>America’s pension managers are facing a tough choice nine months into the Covid-19 pandemic: take on more risk, or ask for more money from employers and workers.<br />Pensions and other retirement-benefit programs have struggled for years to figure out how to close the gap between the assets they have on hand and the cost of benefits they have promised to pay out in future decades. Their concerns continued to grow as investment returns fell.<br />The pandemic is adding urgency to that long-term problem. While the S&P 500 index has surged 15% this year, analysts are projecting weaker long-term stock-market performance than expected at the end of 2019. Bond rates are expected to remain low in the wake of federal stimulus measures, meaning that fixed-income portfolios, traditionally the bread and butter of pension funds, will return little. Together, those factors are pushing retirement-fund managers across the country to take action to keep shortfalls from growing.<br />“What rate can I expect a dollar of my investment to grow? That’s more challenging now,” said Steve Foresti, chief investment officer at Wilshire Consulting, an adviser to many large pension funds.<br />In September, Wilshire lowered its 10-year annual return projection to 5.5% for U.S. stocks from 5.75% at the end of last year. The projection for long-term core bonds, the bread and butter of old-age savings, fell to 1.75% from 3.25%. Even projections for some alternative assets dropped, with private equity dropping to 7.45% from 7.95% and real assets declining to 5.35% from 5.9%.</td>

      <td>Federal Reserve officials have been hesitant to give credence to market speculation that they will boost the stimulus they are giving to the economy via changes in their bond-buying program, as many of them have said renewed fiscal aid is what the economy really needs. Some Fed officials also have said they see no need now to change the central bank’s support for the economy. With the interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee preparing to meet Dec. 15-16, here is a sampling of what Fed officials have said since their last gathering in November.<br /><br />“We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible on behalf of communities, families and businesses across the country.”<br />“We’re buying a lot of Treasurys, we’re buying $80 billion a month, that’s comparable to the pace of QE2…These are big programs, the mortgage program is also quite, quite substantial.”<br />No comments on monetary policy</td>

      <td>The U.S. is about to launch one of the most daunting public-health efforts in generations: swiftly distributing a Covid-19 vaccine across all 50 states, each of which will determine who gets priority.<br />As soon as this weekend, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to grant emergency approval to a Covid-19 vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE .  Within 24 hours, 6.4 million doses are set to be sent to every state and the District of Columbia. For most, that initial shipment will be enough to inoculate a little under 1% of their populations.<br />Most states are giving the initial batch to doctors, nurses and other health-care workers who interact with infected patients. As more doses are shipped, many said they would give priority to residents of long-term-care facilities next. The bulk of the population is expected to get the vaccine in the spring or summer, officials have said.<br />But state vaccination plans vary widely and leave many questions unanswered. Health officials are having to prioritize among competing groups including older adults, teachers and minority communities disproportionately affected by Covid-19. Many states also face challenges getting the vaccine to dramatically different populations, from crowded and diverse cities to isolated rural towns.<br />And they have to do it while coping with a surge in coronavirus cases already straining resources in many parts of the nation.</td>

      <td>Game launches this week after being delayed three times—in part because of challenges caused by employees working from home</td>
      <td>Videogame maker  CD Projekt SA  was finishing its biggest-ever title, anchored by Hollywood star Keanu Reeves, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit earlier this year and bogged the Polish company down with time-eating remote-work problems.<br />On Thursday, “Cyberpunk 2077” will finally hit the market after three delays that have both fed fan anticipation and changed the calculus for its success because of the project’s higher costs. The struggles of the Warsaw-based company reflect the challenges of managing creative teams remotely as well as the difficulties a smaller player confronts trying to create a blockbuster in the competitive, fast-growing videogame market.<br />CD Projekt could use a big hit. The company has only one other major game franchise, and all eyes are on “Cyberpunk” because it is the industry’s only original major title coming to market this holiday season.<br />Executives at CD Projekt said the cost of making and marketing “Cyberpunk” was significantly higher than the roughly $80 million the company spent on its last game, “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,” without providing specifics. They said they initially miscalculated how long “Cyberpunk” would take to complete, with the health crisis most affecting the latter stages of four years of development, following pre-production work that started around 2012.<br />With employees homebound, making even a minor tweak—such as changing the placement of characters or objects in a scene—would take hours instead of minutes, said Marcin Iwiński, who co-founded CD Projekt with a high-school friend in the early 1990s and is now co-chief executive with Adam Kiciński. “There’s less iteration and communication on a daily basis,” he said.</td>

      <td>The dollar’s weakness is complicating matters for both policy makers and investors in Europe.<br />Bets that Covid-19 vaccines will propel the global economic recovery next year have prompted investors to buy assets outside the U.S., pushing the dollar lower in recent weeks. That has left the euro up more than 8% against the greenback this year, and near its highest level since April 2018. It traded Wednesday at about $1.2135 apiece.<br />The rally in the common currency threatens to impede European policy makers’ efforts to stoke inflation in the region. A stronger euro makes exports from the region less competitive overseas, potentially curbing economic growth. It would also make imports less expensive for the eurozone, and damp inflation.<br />Such concerns are eroding investors’ appetite for eurozone stocks. The Euro Stoxx 50, a benchmark for the region, has dropped more than 5% since the end of last year. That compares with the S&P 500 index’s almost 15% gain.<br />The region’s pace of economic growth “is okay, but not enough to put any upward pressure on inflation,” said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for core investments at AXA Investment Managers. “It’s not a time for big asset-allocation decisions in Europe.”</td>

      <td>Even after the pandemic has passed in Europe and the U.S., luxury brands expect to do a lot more business in Asia. Their next job is to reduce the burden of emptier shops in cities like Paris and Milan.<br />From January through October this year, designer labels opened more boutiques in Asia than any other region, according to data from  Savills .  It is the first time that Europe, normally the most popular location for new stores, has been outpaced in the real-estate firm’s records. North America’s share of global openings halved compared with 2019 levels.<br />Much of the activity happened in mainland China, where demand for luxury goods has recovered rapidly after lockdowns early in the year. Of all the stores opened around the world so far in 2020, 19% were in Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen—far higher than their 6% average share of global openings over the past three years.<br />The trend has been exaggerated by the coronavirus, which has emptied Western cities of tourists, but is expected to outlive it. Even after long-haul travel returns to normal, Chinese consumers—by far the industry’s biggest spenders—will likely shop more at home.<br />Before the crisis, they made 70% of their luxury purchases overseas, mainly in European cities like London and Paris. But the Chinese government looks determined to keep that money at home. This summer, Beijing tripled consumers’ duty-free allowance and opened domestic duty-free stores where the quota can be spent up to six months after a trip.</td>

      <td>An aging population may finally force the government to face long-needed reform challenges head on</td>
      <td>China is getting older. That means the Chinese people will have to work longer. But deeper reforms will also be necessary to ensure income growth doesn’t stagnate.<br />The world’s most populous country has begun aging rapidly over the past decade, but the pace is going to pick up even more as tens of millions reach retirement age. The working population—people between the ages of 15 and 59—will drop by 65 million, or 5.5% of the total, in the next 10 years, according to United Nations projections. A graying population is a common problem in most developed countries but due to China’s one-child policy, which lasted for more than 30 years, its population will age quicker and at lower income levels than in many other countries. The problem looks even more unavoidable as China takes in only minimal numbers of immigrants.<br />That’s why Beijing floated the idea of raising the retirement age in the outline of its next five-year economic plan released last month. There are no concrete details yet, but the idea has already received angry pushback online, especially from people who are about to retire.<br />But postponing the retirement age will be inevitable. China’s retirement age—60 for men and 55 for women for civil servants and white-collar workers—is low compared with other countries. Lifting that to 65 could delay the aging problem by a decade or so. The 60 to 64 cohort is going to make up around 8% of China’s population in 2030, according to the U.N.<br />Even so, the elderly population of 65 or above will still double in the next 15 years. That means slower growth and that the government will have to shoulder a bigger burden to take care of its senior citizens, all while Chinese average incomes remain far below aging developed countries including the U.S. or South Korea.</td>

They have upgraded air filters, lowered capacity, required preboarding Covid-19 tests and enforced physical distancing.<br />But the virus still found its way on board.<br />A cruise ship operated by  Royal Caribbean  International returned to port in Singapore on Wednesday after an 83-year-old passenger tested positive. All of the passenger’s close contacts were isolated and have since tested negative, according to the Singapore Tourism Board. The remaining guests have been instructed to stay in their rooms until they get the all-clear, and meals are being sent directly to the rooms.<br />Royal Caribbean was one of two operators recently allowed to resume sailing from Singapore under safety protocols developed in collaboration with the city-state’s tourism authorities. Its ship, Quantum of the Seas, was forced to cut its trip short after the passenger complained of diarrhea and later tested positive.<br />All passengers will be allowed to disembark after a review of contact tracing is complete and will be tested before leaving the terminal, authorities said. “That we were able to quickly identify this single case and take immediate action is a sign that the system is working as it was designed to do,” the company said.</td>

The private-equity firm, which specializes in retail and consumer investments, had agreed last month to a purchase price of $540 million, subject to certain adjustments, the assumption of some liabilities and other terms.<br />“This is a pretty marvelous transaction and I just wanted to applaud all of you for putting this together and getting this done,” Judge Huennekens said during a hearing Tuesday held by phone and video.<br />The deal, which could close by next week, will preserve the business as a going concern with at least 900 stores. As of late August, Ascena operated 1,500 retail locations throughout the U.S., down from its previous roughly 2,800 stores.<br />“The business will be owned by a sophisticated retail investor with a track record of maximizing value in this space, where others have found it challenging,” said Steven Serajeddini, a lawyer representing Ascena, during the hearing. “We are very thrilled with the result.”</td>

That may be the best way to assess the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s (FHFA) eleventh-hour push to release government-sponsored enterprises  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  from their 12-year captivity.<br />In a better political world, the housing godzillas would have been unwound after the financial crisis. Recall Congress created the GSEs to guarantee mortgages with the purpose of increasing liquidity to the housing market. Their implicit government backstop allowed them to expand their footprints and leverage, which yielded enormous profits.<br />When the housing bubble burst, Fannie and Freddie were stuck with enormous losses on toxic mortgages. At that point they should have been placed in receivership. But the Bush Treasury opted for conservatorship under regulatory control by the FHFA.<br />With a $190 billion injection from Treasury, they gained a new lease on life. In return, Treasury received preferred senior stock, which the giants were supposed to pay a 10% dividend on liquidation preference, and warrants to acquire 79.9% of common shares. The GSEs were also supposed to pay a fee for the government’s open-ended credit.<br />Because they were unable to pay the required dividend or fee, Treasury in 2012 began sweeping their net earnings. Fan and Fred shareholders on Wall Street argue that the government has unfairly appropriated hundreds of billions of dollars in profits. But Treasury still hasn’t come close to being repaid what it was originally owed under the 2008 agreement for rescuing the giants.</td>

      <td>Lloyd Austin’s record and views are more important than his race.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden has picked retired Gen. Lloyd Austin to be his Defense Secretary, and anyone skimming the coverage might believe the most important recommendation is his race. But Senators interested more in substance than identity politics have plenty to think about.<br />Gen. Austin, 67, served the country well during his four-decade career in the Army. As commander of U.S. forces in Iraq from 2010-11, he oversaw America’s retreat from the country. The general wanted to keep tens of thousands of American forces, which is to his credit. Less defensible is his failure to anticipate the full withdrawal that Barack Obama ordered and prepare adequately, which led to a hasty exit. Mr. Biden, who worked with Gen. Austin during the Obama Administration, might be most attracted to him as a loyal lieutenant.<br />Gen. Austin was promoted to Commander of U.S. Central Command (Centcom) in 2013 and held the job for three years as Islamic State rampaged across Iraq and Syria. His role in the failed program to train Syrian rebels deserves attention, as does the military’s apparent surprise at the fall of Mosul and swift rise of ISIS in 2014. His spokesman denied it, but Gen. Austin reportedly told the White House that ISIS was only “a flash in the pan.”<br />Blame for the Middle Eastern failures of these years sits primarily with Mr. Obama and his team, including Mr. Biden. But Gen. Austin’s role warrants more scrutiny during confirmation hearings. As a general, he was known for his reticence in command circles. We worry whether Gen. Austin (and the Pentagon) would be sidelined in policy debates among the Biden confidants who will run the National Security Council and State Department.<br />Another concern is that Gen. Austin’s experience is fighting land wars in the Middle East while the growing threat is a sea conflict with China. GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher has it right that Gen. Austin is “a patriot” but “not the pick if you believe China is an urgent threat.” Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley recently predicted “a lot of bloodletting” in the Pentagon to fund a more prepared Navy, but that will take political will from a defense chief.</td>

      <td>President Trump deserves credit for rebuilding America’s armed forces, so it’s a pity his parting shot is a veto spectacle over a defense policy bill. Mr. Trump won’t extract what he wants but he might harm some of his own priorities with friendly fire.<br />Congress this week is voting on the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, which sets policy outlines for the military and national security. This year’s iteration includes several good provisions toughening U.S. China policy. One establishes a Pacific Deterrence Initiative that authorizes $2.2 billion for, among other things, putting more military assets in China’s backyard and conducting exercises with allies.<br />The bill also authorizes programs for overhauling an aging nuclear deterrent, a Trump priority. “We cannot overemphasize the immediate need to modernize our nuclear delivery systems and stockpile,” civilian and uniformed defense officials told the Senate in testimony in September. They warned that “decades of deferred investments in nuclear warheads” and surrounding infrastructure has stretched systems “well beyond their original service lives.”<br />Not all of the bill is worth passing, and a veto threat from President Trump wouldn’t have been a kamikaze run if it were over more investment in hypersonic missiles or more ships. But Mr. Trump has taken the defense bill hostage in his crusade against social-media companies, saying that he won’t sign it unless it includes a repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.<br />Section 230 might deserve some limits given how broadly courts have interpreted its liability protections, as Justice Clarence Thomas recently argued. But eliminating it could have major economic consequences that Congress might later regret, and this shouldn’t be rushed through with only token debate.</td>

Chuck Yeager, the first man to travel faster than the speed of sound, died in his home at the age of 97.<br />In 1947, Yeager, a young Air Force pilot from the little town of Hamlin, W.Va., was chosen to fly a rocket-propelled plane, the Bell XS-1, on a supersonic flight over the Mojave Desert. On October 14 he flew the plane, which he named Glamorous Glennis after his wife, at a speed of Mach 1.06—700 miles per hour. The night before he had broken two ribs by falling off a horse, and he could barely reach up to seal the hatch, but only his wife and a close friend knew about it.<br />In a 1985 memoir, Yeager famously expressed his sense of disappointment at crossing the threshold of sound and creating the world’s first sonic boom. “And that was it,” he wrote. “After all the anticipation to achieve this moment, it really was a let-down.”<br />But by then he had defied death more often than anybody knew. As a pilot in World War II, Yeager shot down at least 13 enemy fighters. He once downed five German aircraft in a single day. Yeager was shot down himself over France, but made it across the Pyrenees and into Spain, sometimes disguised as a peasant and carrying a wounded companion. When the war ended, Captain Yeager was 22.<br />He led missions in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, too, and spent a well-earned retirement giving speeches and conducting himself with decency and honor. Chuck Yeager was an American of an older, rarer kind: ready to take a risk for his country, courageous beyond measure, utterly without pretense.</td>

Dr. Anthony Fauci said this week that to keep the virus from finding new hosts, social distancing should continue until 75% to 80% of the population is vaccinated.<br />With several vaccines on the verge of being approved, talk has understandably turned to distribution. Who should be at the head of the line, health-care workers or elderly residents of long-term-care facilities? Do we give it first to the people most likely to die from Covid or to the people most likely to spread it? At some point, these questions will have to be addressed, but they are all secondary to whether we can get enough people vaccinated.<br />At this point, we still don’t even know how well the vaccines will work. We know how they fared in clinical trials, but previous vaccines have proven to be less effective outside clinical settings. People who enroll in clinical trials tend, among other things, to be healthier than the public at large and easier for doctors to observe. But assuming that the vaccines are effective, how do you convince enough people to get inoculated at a time when public trust in government institutions is at historic lows?<br />One way to go is using carrots instead of sticks. Telling people they can’t fly or send their kids to school may work in some cases, but there’s evidence that paying people to get vaccinated might be more effective. In a typical year, less than half of American adults bother to get flu shots. But a 2015 study conducted by economists at Swarthmore College found that offering people a $30 reward was enough to increase vaccination rates by 12 percentage points.</td>

      <td>The next version of the Paycheck Protection Program should focus on helping smaller firms.</td>
      <td>With the coronavirus surging and colder weather limiting outdoor activities, the economy needs another round of fiscal policy support. Aid to small businesses should be part of any federal package, but it should be structured somewhat differently than the original Paycheck Protection Program.<br />Yes, the economy added 245,000 jobs in November, and the unemployment rate fell to 6.7%. But the pace of job gains is notably slower than the 2.7 million net new jobs added in May and the 4.8 million added in June. Consumer spending is slowing, and consumer confidence is weakening. The household savings rate has plummeted since April, as consumers burn through savings. After a remarkable recovery this spring, a double-dip recession is in the cards.<br />That recovery was aided by PPP, created as part of the Cares Act to provide forgivable loans—essentially grants to finance operating costs—to businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Our research shows that PPP supported employment and increased financial health in the small-business sector. In addition, PPP supported labor demand and is reducing the length of the recovery by helping small businesses—the potential employers of any unemployed workers—to survive over the spring, summer and fall.<br />At this point, though, many small businesses are running on fumes. The next round of PPP should make four changes from its original structure:<br />• Focus on smaller firms. Our research suggests they are the most responsive and likely most in need. A 300-employee cap seems reasonable.</td>

      <td>Religious leaders have been too deferential to unreasonable Covid restrictions.</td>
      <td>The Bronx, N.Y.<br />The Supreme Court smacked down Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s arbitrary limits on church attendance in certain Covid hot spots late last month. The decision was a welcome reprieve for religious leaders, who have for the most part bent over backward to accommodate pandemic restrictions imposed by civil authorities. But enough is enough. America’s churches should reopen fully, and they should do it now.<br />Anyone who thought the high court’s 5-4 ruling would end government attempts to squeeze the right to free exercise of religion was wrong. Mr. Cuomo dismissed the decision as “irrelevant” and “political.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom has imposed a 10 p.m. curfew, which would seem to place midnight Mass in the category of a criminal conspiracy.<br />They canceled Easter. Is Christmas next?<br />At my Catholic parish in the North Bronx, the requisite masking is in effect, hand sanitizer is everywhere, and the old regulars are social distancing in the pews. What’s missing are the children. Our parish is healthy. We have a dynamic pastor, several faithful priests, and a vibrant neighborhood loaded with kids and families. During normal times, the 10:30 a.m. Sunday Mass would feature a children’s choir and a corps of young altar servers. It would be held in the auditorium of the parish high school next door, to accommodate a bulging congregation of mothers with strollers and fidgety tweens in soccer uniforms.</td>

      <td>Doctors, nurses, therapists and scientists worked to find treatments while waiting for a vaccine.</td>
      <td>My mother, Myrna Nielson Thacker, got polio just after Thanksgiving 1951, when she was 14. She had spent the long weekend with family in Salt Lake City. On returning home 50 miles south in Spanish Fork, she experienced a fever, numbness and stiffness in her feet and legs, and excruciating pain in her back. Within a few days, she was paralyzed from the waist down.<br />Polio was the pandemic of the early 1950s. As with the coronavirus, many of those infected had little or no symptoms. But for about 1% of infections it entered the central nervous system, and in 1 of 1,000 cases it progressed to paralysis. Flulike symptoms created fear that you had a potentially deadly virus. Then as now, everyone was learning in real time. Doctors, nurses, therapists and scientists worked to find treatments while waiting for a vaccine.<br />After my mother was diagnosed by a Spanish Fork doctor, her parents took her to Salt Lake City. When a policeman pulled them over for speeding, my grandfather explained the situation. The officer escorted them the rest of the way to the hospital.<br />Temporary polio isolation units, like those we’ve seen erected in some coronavirus hot spots, were common. She was admitted to the Salt Lake County Hospital’s polio isolation ward, where she had to dispose of all her belongings and any visits were severely restricted.<br />For a young teenager, the isolation and paralysis were overwhelming. She wrote that she could hardly sleep at night. But she noticed a light bulb in the hallway, which became a comfort to her and “taught me how important light is in lifting our spirits. It gave me something to focus on instead of the pain.”</td>

      <td>A gimlet-eyed chronicle of a glamorous and tumultuous life in journalism that spares no one, least of all the author herself.</td>
      <td>Barbara Amiel is the wife of Conrad Black, the newspaper tycoon who was convicted of fraud and went to prison in 2008. Now, a year and a half after his pardon from President Donald Trump, comes her memoir, a tome nearly 600 pages long. When it comes to those who have crossed her, the word “pardon” is not in her lexicon.<br />Ms. Amiel leaves no score unsettled in this waspish, often scandalous, gossipy, vengeful, intimate chronicle of her tumultuous life (there’s even a “friends and enemies” list at the end). It’s also disarmingly frank, funny and very well written.<br />Lord Black of Crossharbour (his full title when he was made a life peer in 2001) was chairman of Hollinger International, the media company that owned, among other publications, the Daily Telegraph and the Chicago Sun-Times. After their marriage in 1992, the Blacks led a life of extraordinary opulence: Lincoln Center galas, A-list parties, two private jets, mansions in Kensington and Palm Beach, an apartment on Park Avenue and a house in Toronto. Then, in 2003, things started to unravel as investigations began into Lord Black’s financial dealings.<br />Ms. Amiel, who is now 80, was no stranger to adversity. She had a difficult childhood, growing up during the Blitz in Hendon, a suburb of London, and encountering anti-Semitism at an early age. Her parents divorced when she was 8. Three years later, her stepfather moved the family to Hamilton, a steel town in Ontario. Her mother made frequent attempts to kill herself. When Ms. Amiel was 14 she left home, continuing high school while living in rented rooms. Her natural father committed suicide. She started using codeine, a morphine derivative. “After taking the tablets my spirits got a hit of euphoria . . . All I needed then were an occasional couple of pills. All I need now are a couple or at max three or four a day.” She swallows them with a cocktail of Carnation evaporated milk and Ribena, the blackcurrant drink given to British children. Where on earth did she come up with that concoction? She doesn’t say.<br />Before she became Lady Black, Ms. Amiel had a hugely successful career in journalism. In 1983 she became the first woman editor of a daily Canadian newspaper, the Toronto Sun. She married three times and moved to London, where, in 1986, she became an outspoken conservative columnist for the Times. After 9 years, she went to the Daily Telegraph. She was beautiful, addicted to “raiment,” and had a succession of lovers, including a toy boy “so physically perfect a specimen that you really wanted to put him nude on the mantelpiece.” She declares: “The perception of me was that of a cool seductress, rippling and swirling through life. And perhaps when you so describe yourself in spite of yourself, some of the cheaper characteristics do rub off on you.”</td>

Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat and former Pentagon official, said Tuesday she respected Gen. Austin, who retired from the military in 2016. However, she added, “Choosing another recently retired general to serve in a role that is designed for a civilian just feels off.”<br />“General Austin has had an incredible career,” she added, “but I’ll need to understand what he and the Biden administration plan to do to address these concerns before I can vote for his waiver.”<br />Mr. Biden formally named Gen. Austin as his choice for the job on Tuesday and praised him as a “true and tested soldier and leader.” The president-elect also defended his choice, as criticism began building following news reports Monday of Gen. Austin’s impending selection.</td>

Security Council resolutions, including by taking action against companies, individuals, and vessels that engage in prohibited trade.

Nasdaq is not asking the SEC to “impose a quota system,” nor are we “mandating” the composition of boards.<br />Our duty is, as your editorial says, and our proposal to the SEC outlines, to provide “transparency for shareholders.”<br />Our proposal does precisely that: Nasdaq listed companies should disclose the diversity of their boards. We propose that companies have at least two diverse directors: one who self-identifies as female, and one who self-identifies as either an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+. Companies would be given time to meet this objective. Those who can’t, or don’t believe it’s appropriate, have the option to explain why. Our proposal preserves each company’s decision-making authority over its board while advancing an important dialogue among its shareholders.<br />Investors increasingly care about diversity and governance, as evidenced by the surge in net asset flows into ESG-focused strategies from $4 billion in 2016 to $40 billion in 2020. Our disclosure-based proposal provides investors with greater transparency about board composition. This only serves to enhance investor confidence in the director selection process.<br />Nasdaq is required by the SEC to protect investors and promote the public interest. While capitalism has shown that it can improve the lives of billions, trust and support for the markets will only be maintained if its workings and results are shared by all of society. We hope our proposal, which aims to increase transparency about diversity in corporate America, can be part of the solution.</td>

However, it was only in retrospect that I appreciated the high cost that my dad paid to provide for his family with the least disruption to our lives. I thank my dad, John Mullaly, for his sacrifice.

      <td>Expansion of product lineup is direct strike against companies like Bose and Sony</td>
      <td>Apple Inc.  on Tuesday revealed plans to sell AirPods-branded over-the-ear headphones, an expansion of its product lineup in a direct strike against companies such as Bose Corp. and  Sony Corp.<br />Apple’s new AirPods Max will cost $549 and promise noise canceling, advanced acoustics and up to 20 hours of battery life, the company said. The headphones, which go on sale today and begin shipping next week, are coming a little more than a year after Apple introduced a high-end version of its AirPods wireless earbuds. AirPods are now one of Apple’s most successful new products.<br />The Cupertino, Calif., company also said it plans next week to begin selling a subscription fitness service around its Apple Watch costing $10 a month or $80 a year. The announcement puts Apple in steeper competition with  Peloton Interactive Inc.,  which in addition to its fitness equipment has invested in its digital platform that offers subscriptions to workout classes and more.<br />In recent years, Apple has been looking to broaden its offering of wearable products and services through them amid slowing iPhone sales, though the company has recently benefited from an uptick in demand for its laptops, iPads and digital services due to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Apple’s over-the-ear headphone offerings for years had been centered on its Beats products. Apple bought Beats for nearly $3 billion in 2014 as part of a broader deal to bolster its music business.</td>

      <td>Large-scale virtual presentations of famous works of art obscure rather than illuminate their sources.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />Why go to an art museum? Yes, you can usually get a good lunch there, but this isn’t a trick question: You go there to look at great art, delight in it and learn more about it. Very few of us will ever own a Manet or a Mark Rothko, but you can see examples of their work hanging in American museums from coast to coast, an experience that is nothing like looking at a reproduction in a coffee-table book. Or, at least, you could see them: The Covid-19 pandemic has forced many major art museums to close or sharply limit their viewing capacity, and many art lovers are now understandably reluctant to visit those museums that remain open.<br />How, then, can people who love art continue to enrich their aesthetic lives in something like the manner to which they’re accustomed? New York’s Museum of Modern Art has a very good answer. “Virtual Views: Van Gogh’s ‘Starry Night’” is an online “exhibition” devoted to one of MoMA’s most familiar and best-loved paintings. It includes an introductory video and a Q&A session with Ann Temkin, the museum’s chief curator of painting and sculpture, followed by a “performative reading” by the actor-playwright Anna Deavere Smith of the correspondence between Vincent van Gogh and his brother Theo. The package also includes several other choice items, including “a cosmologist’s take on the painting’s famous sky.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal judge officially closed the criminal case against former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who was pardoned by President Trump, but suggested that the Justice Department’s handling of the matter was highly irregular and potentially improper.<br />In a 43-page opinion released Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote that he was “troubled by the apparently pretextual nature of certain aspects of the government’s ever-evolving justifications” during the three-year legal saga.<br />In the wake of Mr. Trump’s Nov. 26 pardon of Mr. Flynn, Judge Sullivan issued an order that brought the case to an end. But he also took aim at the way the Justice Department had tried to dismiss the case in May, suggesting that but for the pardon, he may have denied their bid and either forced Mr. Flynn to go to trial or to jail.<br />Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, “Dismissal is, of course, the correct result.”<br />Sidney Powell, a lawyer who represents Mr. Flynn, accused Judge Sullivan of bias. She had previously called for him to be recused from the matter.</td>

Vanessa Guillen. Her case attracted national attention, including from President Trump and President-elect Joe Biden.<br />“This report, without a doubt, will cause the Army to change our culture,” Mr. McCarthy said.<br />After interviewing 2,500 uniformed personnel and civilians, the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee found that base officials didn’t properly handle sexual assault and harassment on the base. It also determined that the Army’s uniformed criminal investigators on base were undertrained and overworked, which prevented them from properly investigating sex crimes and soldier deaths. Investigators also found commanders on the base didn’t act to curtail an environment that allowed for harassment and assault.</td>

      <td>States are supposed to resolve election disputes by Tuesday, and if they do, Congress should accept the results under federal law</td>
      <td>A federal deadline Tuesday marks the latest formal step toward confirming President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, further reducing options for President Trump and his supporters to fight the results.<br />States were supposed to try to resolve any disputes over the presidential results and finalize their slate of electors for the Electoral College by Tuesday. It is known as the “Safe Harbor” deadline because, if met, Congress should accept a state’s results as conclusive and reject any further challenges, according to federal law.<br />The deadline usually passes with little notice. This year, the Trump campaign and its allies have so far unsuccessfully launched a battery of lawsuits and sought to persuade some state legislatures to overturn the election results, drawing extra attention to the arcane formalities that states and Congress take to confirm the next president in time for the inauguration on Jan. 20.<br />The “Safe Harbor” deadline doesn’t necessarily end those or other lawsuits. But given that Congress is supposed to respect the results of states that meet the deadline, and with the Electoral College vote coming Monday, it narrows the options for challenging the outcome, according to election law scholars.<br />“I don’t think it’s the kind of the deadline that’s going to bring true finality,” said Richard L. Hasen, an election-law professor at the University of California, Irvine. “It’s more like another nail in the coffin.”</td>

      <td>A Netflix series offers gripping documentary portraits of four remarkable doctors.</td>
      <td>As unlikely as it sounds, “The Surgeon’s Cut” is really about artists. Their métier may be on the margins of medical science—heart transplants, brain surgery, liver grafting, procedures inside the womb—but their personalities are as large, singular and even eccentric as the most “creative” individuals. They possess the same kind of vision and the same kind of drive. What they manage to do is create miracles. What the program’s four directors create—let’s call it a minor miracle—is something that does justice to their subjects.<br />The astonishments in the four-part production are manifold—the surgeries, of course, but the stories, too. Each doctor’s history, already the outcome of often uncanny happenstance and fortune, contains a wrenching twist in the plotline, a revelation that—coming as it does after every other remarkable thing—doesn’t seem possible. And wouldn’t be, if this were fiction.<br />Documentaries often succeed, rightly or wrongly, on the basis of how sympathetic their characters are. Each of the principals in “The Surgeon’s Cut” could be reciting an actuarial table and still be fascinating, but the things that they do explain, in clean, uncluttered fashion, are almost otherworldly. Kypros Nicolaides, the star of episode 1 (“Saving Life Before Birth,” directed by James Newton), is based at King’s College Hospital in London, where one of his specialties is endoscopic laser surgery on fetuses suffering “twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome”: One twin is getting too little blood, which means it is not developing; the other is getting too much, which means a strain on its heart. What Dr. Nicolaides does—through a lens we get to share—is breathtaking, and nerve-racking and not always 100% successful. But the efforts are, by definition, heroic. Likewise, Dr. Nicolaides.<br />Directed by Lucy Blakstad, episode 2 (“Sacred Brain”) is the most overtly cinematic of the four segments and perhaps the best story: Alfredo Quiñones-Hinojosa, a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., grew up in Mexicali, Mexico, within view of the U.S. border fence; as a kid he practiced climbing over it and at age 19 succeeded, only to be put in a detention center. Later, he became a migrant worker in California, took English classes, went to night school, entered the University of California, Berkeley, and later medical school. “I went from harvest to Harvard in seven years,” he says, in a way that tips us off that he’s used the line before (which only makes it more charming). What he calls the “faraway”—the place he and his friends would talk about as kids—turned out to be the human brain, which Dr. Quiñones-Hinojosa regards as a sacred space, “like the gateway to a magical temple,” and from which he excises the most intractable tumors.<br />The mystical aspect of the doctor’s art, rooted in his mix of Catholicism and indigenous culture, is invoked by Ms. Blakstad in several strikingly artistic moments—the doctor spinning around in the OR, for instance, and becoming a Mexican kid spinning around in an archival film. In another sequence, a truckload of migrant workers in the back of a pickup is being passed up by a camera in a car—a car that the camera then suggests is being driven by Dr. Quiñones-Hinojosa himself.</td>

      <td>Likely to captivate viewers young and old, an animated film roots its fantastical story in the island’s tortured history.</td>
      <td>‘Family entertainment” often means something parents can sit through without clawing the armrest off the couch. But the animated “Wolfwalkers” is a different sort of beast. With its enchanted forests, shape-shifting wood sprites and a plucky heroine named Robyn Goodfellowe, the film is terrific fare for kids. But the underpinnings of its fantastical story lie in tortured Irish history, English imperialism, and the use of religion to rationalize oppression; there’s a hum of yearning for a pre-Christian Hibernia of pagans, Druids and nature worship. Adults will be eager to see where it’s all going to go.<br />Where Robyn goes, early on, is the scullery. “Work is prayer,” she is told by the crone-in-chief—and it’s one of the more frightening moments in a film full of formidable action, near-calamity and wolf-imperilment. The setting is Kilkenny, Ireland, in 1650—the very year that capital of the Irish Catholic Confederacy fell to Oliver Cromwell. His name is never mentioned, but he is embodied in the evil Lord Protector (voice of Simon McBurney), who is on hand to enforce order and quell political dissent. The chief source of that dissent are the wolves who inhabit the surrounding forest, along with the Wolfwalkers—young Mebh, who sounds like a 2020 Dublin tween, and her mother, Moll (voices of Eva Whittaker and Maria Doyle Kennedy). They are human-like but possess wolf avatars that leave their sleeping bodies and roam the troubled countryside.<br />Robyn (voice of Honor Kneafsey) is a recent arrival from England, having come with her Roundhead father, who is the Lord Protector’s chief wolf exterminator. Robyn wants to be a wolf hunter, too, until she comes to understand the injustices being done to the wolves and the land. “What cannot be tamed must be destroyed,” says the Lord Protector, who is prepared to burn down the forest if he can’t control it. Cromwell’s policies in Ireland were genocidal, so the villainy is not misplaced.<br />The intentions of the Will Collins screenplay, and the direction (and art direction) of directors Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart, aren’t anti-Christian, per se: As we are told early on, St. Patrick made a deal “with the pagans” to keep the locals close to home and leave the wolves and Wolfwalkers alone; it is the Puritans who are big-footing it around the woods. And the byproducts of worship are certainly celebrated: The visual elements of the animation include the Celtic spirals, interlacing patterns and stained-glass-evoking geometry that are found in the illuminated manuscripts of Dark Ages Ireland. (Mr. Moore also directed 2009’s “The Secret of Kells,” about the Book of Kells, with Nora Twomey, who is a producer here.) The style elsewhere ranges from Monet-like depictions of the wildest Ireland to naive depictions of the village of Kilkenny that suggest perspective-free medieval painting. The Wolfwalkers are aswirl in color and motion; the townsfolk are flat and more cartoonish. But even they seem inspired by the often simple representations of humans rendered by those anonymous illustrators of the monasteries.<br />Among the many clever and understated virtues of “Wolfwalkers” (politics, for instance, are never mentioned) is the way the animals are characterized. The Lord Protector calls the wolves “foul” and “wicked.” In one fulminating moment he says, “By God’s clarity and judgment He vanquishes thee,” though nothing of the sort happens. But there’s no anthropomorphizing by the movie itself: Wolves are wolves, even though the ones here do hang out with very enchanted people.</td>
