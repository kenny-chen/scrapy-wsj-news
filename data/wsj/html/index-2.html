The agency said the economy added 336,000 jobs that month instead of the initially reported 245,000.<br />Meanwhile, the department also said that the record surge in the unemployment rate last spring due to the pandemic was higher than it previously reported. The jobless rate hit 14.8% in April, the highest on record, instead of the previously reported 14.7%.<br />The December decline was driven by a sharp decline in jobs in the leisure and hospitality industries, which lost 498,000 jobs. Retail businesses added 121,000 while manufacturing and construction operations also posted increases that helped offset the overall decline.</td>

      <td>A sheepskin coat is a winter staple, but a phone case? We explain why brands like Cos, Louis Vuitton and Bottega Veneta are using so much of the fuzzy stuff.</td>
      <td>GROWING up in Minnesota where winter temperatures often hover below freezing, Katy Sturgis, 40, learned a few things about dressing for warmth. “My mother had beautiful shearling coats, and once I got older, I loved any opportunity to wear one,” said Ms. Sturgis, who has five shearling toppers of her own. Now living in the somewhat warmer Portland, Ore., the fitness instructor has expanded her shearling wardrobe to include lighter fuzzy pieces like clog boots, fingerless gloves and a shearling-lined denim jacket that combine style and function.<br />In their fall 2020 collections, flocks of fashion brands embraced the plush life too. Some offer fairly sensible luxe styles.  Louis Vuitton ’s  shearling-lined houndstooth blazer is perfect for dining al fresco in a fancy yurt. And Bottega Veneta’s butter-hued maxi coat will keep you toasty in a city snow squall. Others, however, flirt with frivolity. There’s no practical reason a fanny pack, phone case or handbag should be made of shearling, but it sure does look cool. Ditto for this season’s sneakers, boots and Mary Janes that come wrapped in the stuff. Shearling is in, even when it’s curiously inside-out. Who cares if that means frostbitten toes?<br />Shearling’s calming texture might explain why so many designers are peddling puzzling sheepskin wares, both real and faux. The cuddly material is soothing and reassuringly soft in these pandemic times. “Touch, tactile experience is really important to me,” said Mallory Farrugia, 34, who owns a creative agency in Brooklyn. She styles her two pairs of No. 6 shearling-lined clog boots with everything from casual jeans to dresses with tights. Last year, she even softened up her living room with a sheepskin rug, an addition to a faux shearling blanket and pillows. “Having the sheepskin underfoot sparks a bit of joy on a winter day,” she said.<br />The appetite for shearling everything is increasing. Maria Lye, the Paris-based Australian designer who founded the brand Toasties—whose website is widely considered a shearling Shangri-La—reports business has been booming in recent months. Toasties currently offers dozens of different Crayola-colored shearling accouterments including bandannas, berets and bicycle seat covers. And its future looks even fuzzier: Ms. Lye, 33, plans to launch blankets, pillows and other home accessories later this year.<br />As we herd toward peak shearling, is there a danger of fluff overkill? To avoid woolly-mammoth comparisons, refrain from wearing it head to toe. Los Angeles designer Jenni Kayne, whose shearling-lined mules are a cult favorite, suggests you restrict yourself to a single piece. Ms. Lye, who wears up to five shearling accessories at once, follows a “more is better” philosophy. However, she draws the line at jewelry. “I wouldn’t recommend earrings or a necklace in shearling,” she said. Indeed, that would just look silly.</td>

Japan immediately rejected the ruling, saying the issue was settled in a 1965 treaty that normalized relations and an agreement in 2015 that provided financial support for the so-called comfort women.<br />“This is completely unacceptable,” Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said. “I strongly urge the South Korean government to take measures to correct this violation of international law.”<br />Japan’s foreign ministry summoned the South Korean ambassador in Tokyo to protest.<br />The ruling puts President-elect Joe Biden in an awkward position as his administration seeks to build a broad alliance of allies, said Jin Chang-soo, a Japan expert at the Sejong Institute, a think tank near Seoul.</td>

      <td>The new hog futures may smooth out some of the wild swings in Chinese markets</td>
      <td>China opened its own hog futures market, the culmination of a yearslong effort to create a transparent pricing mechanism for one of the country’s most valuable agricultural products.<br />On Friday, traders, farmers and other market participants began buying and selling contracts for live pig deliveries in September 2021, December 2021 and March 2022. Prices for all three tumbled more than 7% from opening levels set by the exchange, with the front-month contract closing on Friday afternoon at 28,290 yuan a metric ton, which is equivalent to $4,367.98 a metric ton and works out to about $1.98 a pound.<br />The price drops reflect expectations that China’s hog population—the world’s largest—will continue to expand after earlier being decimated by the deadly African swine fever in 2018 and 2019.<br />China is home to more than 370 million pigs, and is also the world’s largest consumer of pork, a staple in many Chinese households. Over the past two years, average spot prices of live hogs have soared and swung widely, influenced by the prices Chinese farmers receive when they take their pigs to local slaughterhouses on any given day.<br />Large price fluctuations have accompanied a recovery in the country’s swine population over the course of 2020, as domestic farmers worked to rebuild their herds after losing many pigs to the disease. Pork prices, meanwhile, are rising again ahead of the 2021 Lunar New Year holiday, when meat consumption typically increases.</td>

      <td>If President-elect Joe Biden bats the thorny question of tech taxes down the road the way Democratic predecessor Barack Obama did, investors will pay the price.<br />U.S. tech giants are already handing over so-called digital-service taxes to the French government. Unless the incoming administration restarts global efforts to reform corporate-tax rules, the likes of Alphabet, Apple and  Facebook  will soon face myriad such levies around the globe. On Thursday, the U.S. trade representative said it would delay retaliatory action against France promised by President Trump, essentially leaving the problem for Mr. Biden.<br />U.S. backing is crucial for a deal. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development started working in 2013 to update industrial-era corporate tax rules for online companies and crack down on what many countries see as aggressive tax avoidance. But the project was soon shelved because of a lack of support from then-President Obama.<br />Mr. Biden won’t necessarily hold the same view of global tax reform he did back then. A lot has changed politically and economically. The incoming administration has also talked of taking a much stronger stance on the regulation and antitrust treatment of big tech companies.<br />With a technical solution in sight, a deal could be done this year if the U.S. wants it. Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul changed the rules at home, renewing the U.S. Treasury’s interest in global reform. That revived the OECD project, which made rapid progress until last summer. It stalled after Washington appeared to get cold feet.</td>

      <td>Unreliable flows and inconsistent narratives have sent different stock markets in Asia sharply higher, with many now outperforming U.S. equities</td>
      <td>Equity markets are seeing a strong start to the year globally. In parts of Asia, maybe too strong.<br />Six months ago, it was common to hear that while U.S. markets might recover a large portion of early-2020 losses quickly, emerging markets would be slower to bounce back. But the MSCI EM Index is practically level with the MSCI USA for the past 12 months, and many Asian equity indexes are way above U.S. peers.<br />The Taiwanese and South Korean bourses are the most obvious examples. The Taiex and Kospi are up 45% and 36%, respectively, since the beginning of 2020, while the S&P 500 is up more like 18%. China’s equity market recorded a strong 2020, but the most interesting performances may be outside the world’s second-largest economy.<br />Perhaps most perplexing is India’s equity stock market. The Sensex index now matches the S&P 500’s gain in dollar terms for the same period. India, of course, has nothing like the capacity of the U.S. to support the economy with either monetary or fiscal policy. Its price to earnings ratio for the 12 months ahead has risen even more than its U.S. equivalent since the nadir in March.<br />The countries performing well each have some things going for them: India will be one of the first developing countries in the world to begin a vaccine campaign, South Korea’s low number of Covid-19 cases has been a model for countries with active outbreaks, and Taiwan has managed to keep itself almost hermetically sealed away from the pandemic.</td>

      <td>Katie Porter’s questioning of witnesses, often with a white board, made her a high-profile House member during her first term</td>
      <td>REP. KATIE PORTER, the California Democrat whose interrogations of financial executives and Trump administration officials gained wide notice, is unlikely to remain on the House Financial Services Committee, after Democratic leaders have been unresponsive to her requests for a waiver that would allow her to continue serving on the panel despite having two other committee assignments. Porter has been added to the Natural Resources Committee for the new Congress, and remains on the Oversight Committee. But she has pushed to remain on Financial Services, given her background in bankruptcy law that has made her an ally of progressives including her mentor, Sen. Elizabeth Warren.<br />Porter sent a letter requesting a waiver to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Nov. 30. After not getting an affirmative response, she sent another on Wednesday, noting that five waivers remain available for members to join the committee while retaining their other committee assignments. A Pelosi spokesman didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />“If you do not grant me a waiver to serve on Financial Services, I respectfully request the ability to continue my decades of work on financial issues through service” on a select committee on economic disparities, Porter wrote in the letter reviewed by the Journal.<br />Porter’s questioning style, often featuring a white board and a Socratic give-and-take with witnesses, made her one of the most high-profile first-term House members during the last Congress and led to speculation that she would run for Senate. Porter flipped a competitive district in Orange County, Calif., in 2018 and expanded her margin of victory to seven points in 2020.<br /></td>

      <td>Investors and politicians have made their views clear about oil’s uncertain future. Consumers, not so much.</td>
      <td>You might be filling up your tank a lot longer than  BP  thinks.<br />Ambitious green policies—from politicians and even the newly climate-conscious oil companies—suggest the world is moving at warp speed away from fossil fuels. But the transition might not be easy on consumers’ wallets, which is precisely why it could take a while.<br />The idea of “peak oil,” historically a reference to a fear that oil supply was running out, now means something entirely different. British energy giant BP suggested that oil demand might have already reached its apex in 2019 if one were to imagine a world that doubles down on policies that restrict carbon emissions.<br />Others are more conservative. Under its “stated policies scenario,” the International Energy Agency estimates that oil demand will peak around 2030 and plateau. That scenario takes into account announced policy measures and its own judgment of how attainable they seem. As the IEA acknowledges, though, some of the declared policies are far-reaching targets. Chris Midgley, head of analytics at S&P Global Platts, says his group projects the world is unlikely to reach peak demand until the late 2030s, noting that demand for petrochemicals in particular seems resilient.<br />Transportation plays a key role in the timing of that peak; it accounts for the largest share of petroleum consumption globally. For electricity to crowd out oil as a transportation fuel, governments must either provide taxpayer subsidies that make electric vehicles more affordable or place a cost on not switching over, such as even higher taxes at the pump.</td>

Shares of China Mobile, the largest of the three, closed 4.2% lower at 41.5 Hong Kong dollars, the equivalent of $5.35, a share, which is its lowest close in more than 14 years. China Telecom and China Unicom closed 3.5% and 0.9% lower respectively.<br />All three stocks traded in record volumes, with more than one billion shares of China Mobile and China Unicom changing hands, and more than 3.2 billion China Telecom shares trading during the day.</td>

The iPhone maker has been working secretly on the car project in fits and starts for more than six years, while watching the success of Silicon Valley’s  Tesla Inc.  ignite interest in electric vehicles.<br />In recent weeks, Apple has reached out to suppliers about the possibility of doing its own car, potentially starting production as soon as 2024, a person familiar with the matter said last month. Apple shelved an earlier effort to develop its own car a few years ago to focus on driverless car technology.<br />Apple declined to comment.<br />Hyundai, in saying Friday that it has held discussions with Apple, said that “as it is at [an] early stage, nothing has been decided.” In a later statement filed with Korean securities regulators, Hyundai said it had fielded requests of potential cooperation on electric vehicles from multiple companies. Hyundai, with affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. , ranks among the world’s largest auto makers by sales.</td>

      <td>DeVos says President Trump’s rhetoric contributed to deadly mob attack on Capitol Hill</td>
      <td>Education Secretary Betsy DeVos resigned Thursday night, becoming the second member of President Trump’s cabinet to quit since the deadly mob attack on Capitol Hill, which she said was fueled by Mr. Trump’s rhetoric.<br />“We should be highlighting and celebrating your Administration’s many accomplishments on behalf of the American people,” Mrs. DeVos wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump obtained by The Wall Street Journal. “Instead we are left to clean up the mess caused by violent protesters overrunning the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the people’s business. That behavior was unconscionable for our country. There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me.”<br />Her resignation is effective Friday. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said earlier Thursday she would resign, citing the “entirely avoidable” storming of the Capitol building.<br />Mrs. DeVos had been one of the administration’s longest-serving cabinet members—and one of its most polarizing. When the Senate confirmed her nomination in February 2017, she was the first cabinet nominee in U.S. history to require a tiebreaking vote from the vice president—in this case, Mike Pence.<br />Teachers’ unions and progressive activists had strongly opposed her for her lifelong work promoting charter schools, which are publicly funded but often run by private firms. Mrs. DeVos, a Michigan billionaire, also supported vouchers, which use tax dollars to enable students to attend private schools.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R., Ga.) conceded defeat to her Democratic challenger, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, in one of the two Georgia Senate runoffs, accepting election results that showed he had won more votes a day after the AP declared him the winner.<br />“Unfortunately, we came up slightly short in the runoff election—and earlier today I called Rev. Warnock to congratulate him and to wish him well in serving this great state,” Ms. Loeffler told supporters in a video released by her campaign Thursday evening.<br />Ms. Loeffler pledged to continue fighting for conservative values and against “the radical agenda of the left.”<br />“I fully intend to stay in this fight for freedom, for our values, and for the future of this great country,” she said.<br />Ms. Loeffler—appointed last year to fill a Senate seat vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson, who retired due to illness—ran in a special election against Mr. Warnock, the pastor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s former church in Atlanta, to finish two years of that term.</td>

      <td>Readers may recall when James Bennet was sacked as Opinion editor of the  New York Times  last year for running an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton suggesting that the military should be called in to quell urban riots. We disagreed with Mr. Cotton at the time but defended Mr. Bennet.<br />Well, the editor returned from exile Thursday with a guest appearance writing Politico’s daily newsletter. “You may have last seen me getting bounced out of The New York Times for running an opinion piece by Sen. TOM COTTON (R-Ark.) arguing for the use of military troops to prevent the rioting that accompanied some of the peaceful protests over the summer,” Mr. Bennet wrote. “As our editorials made clear, I disagreed with Cotton then (that’s one reason I supported running the piece). And so I hope it doesn’t make me a hypocrite now to say that I wish the military had been out in force Wednesday to stop the rioting and protect what Biden called the ‘citadel of liberty.’”<br />Fair point, sir, and welcome back. We’d note that many Democrats are also lamenting the failure of the Capitol police to stop the mob (see nearby). Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan is predicting that some will be fired. We’re also glad to publish Mr. Cotton nearby making a similar point about policing, even if others find it too controversial.</td>

      <td>Pro-Trump rioters shamed the nation Wednesday as they stormed Congress. The chaos was also a failure of law enforcement, and Americans deserve answers about how a violent mob could breach the barricades, enter the Capitol and interrupt the counting of electoral votes.<br />Four people died, with one woman shot by police and three others succumbing to what officials described as “medical emergencies.” D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department says some 56 officers were injured, including one who remains in the hospital after a crowd beat and tased him.<br />Police found pipe bombs outside the Democratic and Republican party headquarters and they discovered a cooler with Molotov cocktails and a gun on Capitol grounds. Rioters set off chemical irritants, attacked law enforcement with metal pipes, shattered windows, and broke into lawmakers’ offices. Americans watched in horror and adversaries with glee.<br />The question is how the U.S. Capitol Police force of some 2,300 officers was overwhelmed. A Capitol Police spokeswoman didn’t respond to our emails or phone calls. Chief Steven Sund said in a statement Thursday that officers’ actions were “heroic given the situation they faced,” adding that “the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol was unlike any I have ever experienced in my 30 years in law enforcement here in Washington, D.C.”<br />Mr. Sund has promised a “thorough review." In a failure of intelligence, the Capitol Police seems to have underestimated the potential for violence. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that “talk of guns and potential violence is rife” on Telegram messaging channels, the social-media website Parler, and the online forum thedonald.win.</td>

      <td>The only description that makes sense is a venting of pent-up resentments.</td>
      <td>Insurrections are common but Wednesday’s aborted insurrection on Capitol Hill was unique. The usual purpose of mobilizing a mass of people and deploying their sheer momentum against the edifices of power, a royal or presidential palace, or a parliament is to seize power—through the act of seizing that iconic building. But that is logically impossible when the ruler is not the enemy to be replaced but rather the intended beneficiary of the insurrection.<br />What happened was certainly not an attempted coup d’état, either. Coups must be subterranean, silent conspiracies that emerge only when the executors move into the seats of power to start issuing orders as the new government. A very large, very noisy and colorful gathering cannot attempt a coup.<br />There have been quite a few cases around the world of what is best described as mass intimidation directed against parliaments. But in all such cases it was some specific law that was wanted or not wanted, which legislators under the gun might then vote for or against. For that to happen, the legislators have to be all gathered in the legislature and kept there to be coerced. Most recently in Beirut last August, Lebanon’s Parliament was besieged by a crowd demanding and forcing the government’s resignation. This conspicuously did not happen in Washington on Wednesday because it was a crowd that invaded the building, not snatch teams sent to seize individual legislators to be cajoled or forced into their seats.<br />Given all these exclusions, only one description remains: a venting of accumulated resentments. Those who voted for President Trump saw his electoral victory denied in 2016 by numerous loud voices calling for “resistance” as if the president-elect were an invading foreign army. These voices were eagerly relayed and magnified by mass media, emphatically including pro-Trump media.<br />Then they saw his victory sullied by constantly repeated accusations of collusion with Russia from chairmen of intelligence committees and ex-intelligence chiefs who habitually accused Mr. Trump of being Vladimir Putin’s agent, claiming they had secret information, which, alas, they could not disclose. They deplored Mr. Trump’s “subservience” to Mr. Putin weekly for four years while refusing to entertain the possibility that in a confrontation with China, it might be a good idea to overlook Mr. Putin’s sins, as Nixon embraced Mao to counter the Soviet Union.</td>

From an early age, Mr. Mayorkas learned to love America, inspired by parents who knew tyranny all too well. Now President-elect Biden has nominated him to lead the Homeland Security Department. If confirmed, he will be the first immigrant to hold the job.<br />Mr. Mayorkas grew up in Los Angeles and went to law school. After a few years in private practice, he began his career of public service as an assistant U.S. attorney specializing in white-collar crimes—including Operation Polar Cap, the largest money laundering case in the nation at that time. He would go on to lead the Central District of California as U.S. attorney from 1998-2001.<br />He returned to federal service in 2009 as director of citizenship and immigrations services at Homeland Security and was responsible for the largest and most complex immigration system in the world. In this role, he realigned the agency’s organizational structure. He enhanced and streamlined many of its programs, including the electronic immigration system and the initiative to police the unauthorized practice of immigration law.<br />In 2013 Mr. Mayorkas was appointed deputy secretary. In that role, he developed strong relationships with the law-enforcement community, including the Fraternal Order of Police.  Thanks to his vision and leadership, we strengthened cooperation between local and state police agencies and their federal counterparts at DHS. His professionalism, integrity and commitment to just and fair enforcement of the law makes him an ideal candidate to lead the department.<br />Mr. Mayorkas has pursued criminal wrongdoers and has protected the rights of the innocent with indefatigable vigor. His work reflects all that is right in government.</td>

The weekly routine of sitting in a church pew on Sunday morning is gone for many. How can we not be weary?<br />Having both worked in the National Football League for decades, we are creatures of routine. Our habits and the structure they create provide us with steadiness, but this went out the window in 2020. We would handle this better if we knew when the pandemic will end, but we do not know what tomorrow holds.<br />Our weariness goes far beyond schedule changes. The challenges drained our collective spirit: violence in American cities; a seemingly never-ending divisive election cycle; apparent helplessness in the face of the virus. Americans’ trust in government, media and even the church continued to diminish. This heightened our anger and left us searching for answers.<br />The racial injustice and division in this country weighs heavily on us too. We acknowledge the progress made, but we are not blind to the long road ahead. We have been buoyed by so many who have become willing to have difficult discussions, learn about this country’s past and present, and acknowledge that all of us need to listen more than we talk.<br />As men of means with strong families, we had it relatively easy. Frontline workers were stretched beyond capacity in 2020. Many friends and family have lost jobs and even lives.

      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />If you flipped on the morning talk shows last Sunday to hear Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious-disease expert, you’d be forgiven if you momentarily thought he was spinning a yarn from science fiction.<br />“We’ve isolated multiple examples of the mutant being in this country, so there’s no doubt it’s here,” Dr. Fauci said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” And on ABC’s “This Week,” he said, “That mutant is already here in the United States. It’s been well-reported.”<br />The “mutant” that Dr. Fauci was describing doesn’t come out of the pages of a comic book. Rather, it is the dangerous new strain of coronavirus that emerged in the U.K. and has rapidly spread to other countries. Many epidemiologists have observed that the latest mutation is a more contagious form, though it does not appear to make the resulting disease more severe.<br />The word “mutant,” much like a mutant virus strain, has evolved in unexpected directions over centuries of usage. It originated in Latin as “mutantem” meaning “changing,” from the verb “mutare.” That same root for “change” also spawned such words as “mutate,” “commute,” “transmute” and even “molt.”</td>

      <td>In Hungarian director Kornél Mundruczó’s English-language debut, a woman struggles to cope after her home birth ends in tragedy.</td>
      <td>‘Pieces of a Woman,” streaming on Netflix, poses a startling question with shattering force. What does a woman do after her pregnancy has ended in a death instead of a new life? Vanessa Kirby is Martha, a Boston woman whose home birth goes disastrously wrong. No mainstream production has ever depicted a childbirth like this one, and Ms. Kirby’s performance is remarkable—not only when Martha is in extremis but once she’s back in what used to be her life, mourning her loss as she surveys the world around her like a benumbed alien from a distant planet. Yet another question is posed by the spectacle of Martha’s delivery, which was shot in a single take that occupies most of the first half hour of running time. Does the rest of the film live up to such an agonizing and yet commanding beginning? Unfortunately it does not, despite the presence of a star who manages to navigate a cluttered narrative with clarity and solemn grace.<br />This is Ms. Kirby’s first leading role in a feature, although anyone who saw her as Princess Margaret in the first two seasons of “The Crown” knows she illuminated every scene she was in with a quicksilver mix of ambition, sardonic wit and heedless passion. Here she’s working, often powerfully, with a much darker emotional spectrum. Martha’s anxiety billows out into horror as she realizes that her obstetric complications are spinning beyond the control of her terrified midwife, Eva (a fine performance by Molly Parker). During the year that follows, Martha is either shut down, acting out melodramatically or lashing out at her explosive, immature partner, Sean (Shia LaBeouf), a recovering alcoholic unable to cope with his own grief, and at her manipulative mother, Elizabeth (Ellen Burstyn), a Holocaust survivor obsessed with revenge in the form of a trial that will send the midwife to prison.<br />It’s a lot, to say the least, and there’s also a mercifully brief subplot involving Sean and a criminal attorney, Suzanne (Sarah Snook), who is part of Martha’s family. The strange thing, though, is that after being moved and frightened by the birth scene (“You’re doing so great,” Sean keeps saying anxiously when that’s clearly not the case); after following Martha through a succession of new torments on her journey toward an elusive peace that proves to be absurdly unconvincing, we still have no real understanding of who she is. Or how her relationship with Sean may have worked before the tragedy; it’s hard to imagine they were ever a natural fit. Or why they decided on a home birth in the first place.<br />Instead of creating the kind of texture and narrative flow that allows characters to reveal themselves gradually and fully, the film devotes increasing attention and lots of clumsy plotting to the question of litigation—can anything be gained by making someone pay for an irretrievable loss? It’s a subject addressed with far more finesse in “The Sweet Hereafter,” Atom Egoyan’s 1997 screen version of the Russell Banks novel.<br />“Pieces of a Woman” was directed by Kornél Mundruczó, working from a screenplay by his real-life partner, Kata Wéber. (A few years ago Mr. Mundruczó did a brilliantly original Hungarian-language feature called “White God,” a parable of ethnic and racial hatred in contemporary Europe in which an army of dogs turns Budapest into a sister city of Pamplona.) Their new film, which was photographed in elegant chiaroscuro by Benjamin Loeb, grew out of the couple’s own loss of a child, an experience they first dramatized in a 2018 stage play of the same name that she wrote and he directed in a successful Warsaw production.</td>

      <td>The Mint Theater streams its exceptional 2018 revival of a Lillian Hellman strike-breaking drama that all but vanished for eight decades.</td>
      <td>One of the few welcome surprises of 2020 was the announcement by New York’s Mint Theater that it had spent the preceding seven years taping broadcast-ready three-camera archival videos of its off-Broadway productions, and that in lieu of live performances during the pandemic, it would stream these videos for free. As regular readers of this column know, the Mint specializes in small-house revivals of unjustly forgotten 20th-century plays. I have been reviewing one or two of its shows most seasons for the past decade and a half, and each one I’ve seen has been well chosen and flawlessly acted and staged. No other theater company in America has a more consistently high record of artistic quality.<br />“Days to Come,” the second of 10 plays by Lillian Hellman to open on Broadway in her lifetime, is one of the most significant of the Mint’s recent revivals, for the original production closed in 1936 after just seven performances and disappeared almost without a trace (prior to the Mint’s 2018 staging, which I saw and reviewed, it appears to have had only one revival anywhere). Most flops close for self-evident reasons, but there is no obvious reason why “Days to Come” did so: It is an extremely strong piece of work, worthy of direct comparison with such better-known Hellman scripts as “The Children’s Hour” and “The Little Foxes,” and the Mint’s production, directed with lean clarity by J.R. Sullivan, makes so powerful a case for it that I am at a loss to understand why so excellent a play vanished from view.<br />This is all the more puzzling in light of the fact that “Days to Come” is a political play, one whose point of view is all of a piece with that of “The Little Foxes,” Hellman’s greatest stage success and one that never fails to please frequent playgoers who share her left-of-center views. It tells the tale of the Rodmans, a factory-owning family of liberals who, faced with the possibility of a strike, make the mistake of hiring a firm of tough detectives (“It’s not a tea-room business,” one of them explains to the Rodmans) who are prepared to do anything, murder very much included, to keep the men at work. Into this volatile situation walks Leo (Roderick Hill), an out-of-town labor organizer, who is no less determined to keep the strike peaceful.<br />What follows, as always with Hellman, is the stuff of solidly built melodrama, drawn with a broad brush but far from cartoonish. I think it’s fairly safe to assume that she got the idea for the play from Dashiell Hammett, her longtime companion, who had worked as a union-busting Pinkerton operative before embracing hard-left politics (and, later in life, unabashed Stalinism) and, in 1929, published “Red Harvest,” a hard-boiled mystery novel whose plot unmistakably prefigures that of “Days to Come.” But Hammett had no gift for playwriting, while Hellman was a master of the well-made play, and though “Days to Come” occasionally stoops to progressive sermonizing, it mostly sticks to down-the-center storytelling.<br />Reviewing a Mint production is a nightmare for critics who thrive on picking flaws. The cast is very well chosen, especially Janie Brookshire, who plays the matriarch of the Rodman family. Harry Feiner, the set designer, has fit two naturalistic interiors onto the Beckett Theatre’s revolving stage—a neat piece of scenic prestidigitation for a 99-seat off-Broadway house, and one of a kind for which the Mint is justly celebrated. (You can actually see the set being changed during the intermission.) Some of the camera angles show the first row of the audience, whose presence is audible without being in any way intrusive. That’s a happy, even comforting touch: You’ll come away from “Days to Come” feeling as though you’ve seen a real stage show, not a telecast.</td>

      <td>Loosely based on a bestseller by the same name, this stunning documentary reveals the inner lives of nonverbal children with autism who nonetheless find ways to express themselves.</td>
      <td>Some of the most thrilling films I know have explored or discovered the intellectual and emotional life of people who cannot express what they’re thinking or feeling. The list starts with “The Miracle Worker” and Helen Keller trapped in her head until a young teacher finds a way to release her. It includes “My Left Foot” (about the severely disabled writer and painter Christy Brown), “Awakenings” (long-catatonic victims of an encephalitis epidemic suddenly released from their frozen state) and “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly” (a French editor paralyzed except for his left eyelid by a rare condition called “locked-in syndrome”). Now another film joins the list, “The Reason I Jump” (in select and virtual theaters). Its newly expressive subjects have also been locked in, to varying degrees; young people on the autism spectrum, they cannot or do not speak. There’s a difference, though. This is a documentary, not a dramatized version of factual history, so we’re getting news bulletins direct from hearts and minds.<br />The title is taken from the Naoki Higashida book that gives the film its form, a slim but celebrated volume, at once concrete and poetic, whose subtitle is “The Inner Voice of a Thirteen-Year-Old Boy With Autism.” When the book came out in an English translation in 2013 it was a revelation, a first-hand, first-mind account of the young Japanese author’s passionate, turbulent and phenomenally rich inner life. The film, directed by Jerry Rothwell, interweaves spoken excerpts from the book—the English-language narrator is Jordan O’Donegan—with intimate portraits from around the world of other nonspeakers with autism. Nonspeakers of out-loud words, that is, since these five remarkable youngsters make paintings, or spell out, letter by letter with pointer boards, written words and eloquent sentences that bespeak the centrality of communication in our gloriously gabby species.<br />The concept is inspired, and inspiring—kids with a misorchestration of neurons, if that’s what it is, escaping from solitary confinement. More than that, the film is beautiful—the cinematography, by Ruben Woodin Dechamps, combines objective views of the subjects and their parents or teachers with startling visual analogues of the ways people with autism perceive the world they inhabit. And “The Reason I Jump” is deeply informative. I thought I had a rudimentary understanding of the repetitive gestures or extreme introversion that may be manifestations of autism, but I tacitly assumed that being on the spectrum implied some degree of emotional impairment. So much for assumptions. Seeing the film, then reading the book that prompted it, swept all of that away.<br />In 2006 Mr. Rothwell co-directed, with Louise Osmond, a haunting documentary called “Deep Water.” The subject was an Englishman named Donald Crowhurst who, in 1968, set off on a solitary circumnavigation of the globe. Delusional about his skills as a sailor, Crowhurst had no aptitude for the months of spiritual isolation that lay ahead, and his voyage became a suicide mission. “The Reason I Jump” is also about spiritual isolation, and what’s required to transcend it.<br />The instrument of literal breakthrough for several of the film’s subjects has been the pointer board. It helps to enhance motor control for people who can’t write, let alone speak, and to organize cyclonic swirls of thoughts by reducing them to the basic units of written language, i.e. letters. One of the most stirring moments of the film comes when a previously uncommunicative and obviously bright young man named Ben declares joyously, “I never thought this was possible.”</td>

      <td>A documentary examines the life of Elizebeth Friedman, who helped take down Nazis and bootleggers like Al Capone; James Herriot’s tales of an English vet are adapted, winningly, once again.</td>
      <td>Hoping to inspire ambition in his U-boat captains in 1942, Adolf Hitler offered a prize of $250,000 to any who succeeded in sinking the Queen Mary, a passenger liner converted into a troop ship. Guided by coded messages, the U-boats found their intended target off the coast of Brazil. This would lead, of course, to no prizes, nor would the Queen Mary suffer any damage; decrypted messages delivered to the captain enabled him to maneuver the ship to safety. These were warnings made possible—as “The Codebreaker” (Monday, 9 p.m., PBS) reveals—thanks to Elizebeth Friedman, a suburban wife and mother, and a skilled cryptanalyst. Friedman—who had long led a double life—initially put her skills to work for the police, and went on to serve the U.S. military. “The Codebreaker” (an “American Experience” film) delivers an irresistible picture of her life and career in all its complexity.<br />Friedman first became something of a celebrity during the Prohibition era, when the Coast Guard—faced with a ceaseless flood of liquor coming into the country by ship—persuaded her to turn her attention to the secret messages used by the transporters of this illegal cargo. The gangsters in charge had developed impressively sophisticated codes for their business transmissions, though none were a match for Friedman. She delivered so much hard evidence of criminality, all of it the bulletproof kind, that the Coast Guard built a code-breaking unit especially for her in 1931—the first to be run by a woman. When criminal elements put a hit out on her, the Coast Guard arranged for a protective detail. A commentator notes that “It would never have occurred to her not to testify.” These people had to be put away. “That was the whole point of breaking the codes.” No comment in this affecting work better expresses the film’s regard for its subject.<br />Friedman would go on to become the chief witness in sensational criminal trials, including that of Al Capone—whose defense attorneys regularly suggested that she was engaged in a female flight of imagination, if not some version of witchcraft, and that breaking codes had nothing to do with science. She did manage, against the protests of the defense attorneys, to persuade a judge to give her access to a blackboard, whereupon she delivered a detailed lesson on codebreaking. The defense attorneys were left with little to say.<br />Nothing in Elizebeth Friedman’s early life—she was the youngest of 10 children born to a Quaker family in Indiana—had ever given her cause to imagine that she would one day have an essential role in defeating Hitler’s plan to sink the Queen Mary, or that her work would lead to the destruction of a Nazi spy ring in Latin America, or that she would become an immense threat to some of America’s most notorious criminals.<br />During the war, she came to know the meaning of a woman’s place even within a team of her own creation. After Pearl Harbor, her codebreaking unit was shifted from the Coast Guard to the Navy, which put a uniformed male officer with far less cryptanalytical experience than she had in charge of her unit. The Navy, the film explains, had a rule that women couldn’t be in charge of men.</td>

But as Washington miracles go, this political therapeutic should be much easier to achieve than getting the FDA to make the quick decisions it rendered in 2020.<br />Mr. Trump has recognized that regardless of his beliefs about what happened in last year’s elections, Joe Biden will be our new President on Jan. 20. Mr. Trump could now render a public service by going beyond a grudging acknowledgment of reality and offering a warm White House welcome to his successor.<br />The people have voted.

Thursday’s closing level is the highest since March and marks the largest four-day yield gain since after the U.S. elections in November.<br />“The move is clearly on the larger side of what we expected,” said Timothy High, an interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas, who had anticipated before the vote that a Democratic victory would boost yields by 0.05 to 0.10 percentage point.<br />How much higher yields can go depends in large part on whether the incoming Biden administration rolls out stimulus packages that go beyond pandemic relief into other areas, such as infrastructure construction, Mr. High said.<br />Increased fiscal spending would be financed through the sale of more Treasury bonds, a supply surge that many expect to push prices down and yields up.

The new procedure wouldn’t change public access to court records because sealed records already aren’t available to the public, it said.<br />Gaining access to confidential judiciary records could be especially valuable to foreign spies, analysts said, because of the extreme sensitivity of information they often contain, including investigative techniques described in search warrants or specific email accounts or phone numbers being surveilled.</td>

      <td>Removal of widely followed president may hurt engagement, but social network needs to bear the cost</td>
      <td>Twitter  investors may be worried about a future without President Trump. They should instead consider it the cost of doing business.<br />The social-media platform was in sharp focus Thursday following a tumultuous day in which the president encouraged supporters at a rally to march on the U.S. capitol just as Congress was working to formally certify his opponent’s election victory. That march turned into a riot that resulted in the building’s security being breached and attendees being evacuated.<br />The day’s events resulted in Mr. Trump’s Twitter account being suspended. Rival platform  Facebook  suspended Trump’s account for twice as long before Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg announced Thursday morning that the suspension would hold “indefinitely”—at least to the end of the president’s term in two weeks.<br />But only Twitter paid a price with investors. The company’s stock slipped 1.8% by the closing bell while Facebook’s gained 2%—a rise roughly in line with a broad uptick for major tech stocks. The difference makes some sense given Trump’s outsize impact on the platform he favored for years even before becoming president. Mr. Trump’s main Twitter account has nearly 89 million followers, which represents about 48% of the company’s total base of monetizable daily active users last reported at the end of the third quarter. Mr. Trump’s Facebook account boasts about 35 million followers—less than 2% of the company’s 1.8 billion daily active users.<br />Mr. Trump’s future on Twitter is certainly debatable—even if the company allows him to remain for now. He has established a long record of skirting the platform’s rules about posting misinformation and harmful content. And the legitimately thorny question of whether to deplatform the world’s most powerful political leader no longer holds after he leaves office later this month. Twitter already faces the risk of weaker user engagement in the months ahead, with the prospect of a less volatile U.S. political environment and a weakening pandemic as vaccines get rolled out. A strong spike in usage in early 2020 as the pandemic flared creates a very challenging comparison, at least for this year’s first two quarters.</td>

Since then, the Trump administration has used sanctions and other censure, though Beijing has pressed on with its crackdown on the democracy camp.<br />While those tools remain available, Beijing’s decision to conduct the sweep weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office shows that control over Hong Kong takes priority over resetting relations with the U.S.<br />“If one had hoped that Beijing might pause on the Hong Kong crackdown in order to create better conditions to engage with the incoming Biden administration, that hope has been dashed,” said Tom Kellogg, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Asian Law. “The fact that one of the arrestees is an American citizen will further strain ties once the Biden administration takes office.”<br />A spokesman for the Biden transition had no immediate comment on what steps could be taken to support democracy advocates in the Chinese territory. Mr. Biden’s pick for secretary of state, Tony Blinken, said in a tweet that the Biden administration “will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing’s crackdown on democracy.”</td>

The tariffs had been scheduled to take effect Wednesday.<br />The suspension of the tariffs on French products was welcomed by U.S. importers and retailers that had criticized such punitive tariffs as a tool that aims to protect one industry at the expense of another, while hurting American consumers.<br />The decision puts the onus on President-elect Joe Biden and his administration to address increasing demands by other countries for global technology companies to pay more taxes where their customers are located.<br />“The Biden administration is being given the opportunity to implement their own strategy on discriminatory digital taxes,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), the likely next chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “America is going to have to respond.

      <td>Researchers warn that the new variant may spread faster and could reduce the efficacy of vaccines</td>
      <td>A new variant of the coronavirus is driving a powerful second wave of infections in South Africa. The variant has already spread to other countries in Africa and Europe and raised concerns over how it will respond to Covid-19 vaccines.<br />It’s normal for viruses to mutate, and variants observed so far in the coronavirus sweeping the globe have made little difference to how it functions. The South African variant, known as B.1.351, has worried scientists because of its unusually large number of mutations, especially in the spike protein, which the virus uses to attach to and infect human cells.<br />The discovery and spread of the South African variant has coincided with a powerful surge in infections in the country. New daily cases and deaths have already surpassed those seen in the first wave, which peaked in July, and infections are still going up. South African researchers say they also believe that the new variant is more transmissible, since it has quickly crowded out other versions of the virus circulating in the country. Still, they say human behavior—with thousands of South Africans crowding into bars, restaurants and beaches—is likely the main reason for the sharp rise in infections in recent weeks. They are now racing to understand how much more transmissible the new variant is and whether it leads to more severe cases of Covid-19.<br />No cases of the South African variant have been detected in the U.S., but that may be because not enough positive test samples have been sequenced. In the past two weeks, laboratories in Finland, the U.K., Australia, Switzerland, Japan and South Korea have found the South African variant in coronavirus tests conducted there. Researchers in neighboring Zambia say the South African variant now also appears to be the dominant virus there.<br />The scientists who sequenced the South African variant’s genome say it has a mutation—known as N501—that it shares with a separate variant discovered in the U.K. British scientists say that mutation may be responsible for making the variant there much more transmissible.</td>

      <td>China’s Sinovac vaccine has shown to be 78% effective against Covid-19 in Brazilian late-stage trials and offers total protection against severe cases of the disease, raising hopes it can be used to immunize much of the developing world.<br />Brazil’s Butantan Institute, the São Paulo-based research center that tested CoronaVac in Phase 3 trials, said Thursday that none of the volunteers who took the vaccine developed severe cases of Covid-19. More than 12,000 health workers took part in Phase 3 trials in Brazil, the first country to complete tests of Sinovac’s vaccine.<br />“It’s a great result,” said Luiz Carlos Dias, part of a Covid-19 task force of researchers at the University of Campinas in São Paulo state. “If it can prevent severe cases, hospitalizations, deaths, it will help get us out of this pandemic.”<br />CoronaVac’s vaccine is less effective then those being developed by Moderna Inc. and jointly by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE that have shown to have efficacy rates of 94.5% and 95% in testing, respectively. But CoronaVac can be kept in a standard refrigerator between about 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit, making it easier and cheaper to transport and store in less developed countries, infectious disease specialists said.<br />Prashant Yadav, a global health specialist at Washington-based think tank Center for Global Development, said 78% is a high enough rate for many developing countries to consider using the vaccine and potentially good enough for the World Health Organization to consider incorporating CoronaVac into its global distribution system.</td>

      <td>WITH AMERICANS desperate to escape their cramped confines, bike sales have soared along with Covid-19, increasing by 62% between January and October 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, according to market research firm NPD Group. If you’re a fair-weather cyclist, however, winter’s chill poses a bump in the road—unless you protect your pandemic purchase.<br />Just like you might outfit a car with snow tires, you may need to swap in sturdier bike tires for traction on icy surfaces. Look for a thicker tread and extra siping—the thin slits that bite into ice, snow or slush—as well as built-in puncture protection to withstand debris that gets flushed into the roads, said Dylan Varekamp, service manager of NYC Velo in New York.<br />“In winter, you want to get the biggest possible tires that can fit your frame,” said Eric Jones, a bike mechanic at Boulder Bicycle Works in Colorado. They require less air pressure, which drops in cold temperatures, and cover more surface area. Continental’s Top Contact Winter II Premium tires, made of high-tech synthetic fibers, resist tears and have deep treads that grip slippery roads. You can also protect your standard tires with Tannus Armour’s foam inserts (from $70, tannusamerica.com), which fit between the tire and the tube and make a wheel “almost unflattable,” said Mr. Jones.<br />Pedaling on wet roads can kick a muddy stripe up your back and make a mess of your drivechain (which includes cranks, cogs and derailleur). Fenders, like the clip-on SKS Raceblade Pro XL set, are your first line of defense against this and weather-related rust and corrosion, said Mr. Jones.<br />That kicked-up mess isn’t just water and dirt; winter roads are rife with magnesium chloride, salt and de-icer. Those corrosive elements make cleaning your ride crucial to its longevity. “You don’t need to take a toothbrush to the cogs every day, but you should at least rinse and wipe down your bike once a week,” said Mr. Varekamp. Using isopropyl alcohol on the braking surfaces can extract winter grime, boosting your braking power and elongating the lifespan of the pads, added Mr. Jones.</td>

      <td>Low- and middle-income countries are expected to emulate the move to expedite getting shots to at least some at-risk citizens</td>
      <td>JOHANNESBURG—South Africa will start rolling out Covid-19 vaccines without requiring local regulatory approval of the shots, a step that other low- and middle-income countries scrambling to inoculate their populations against the coronavirus are expected to follow.<br />South Africa’s health ministry said the country will in January receive 1 million doses of the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC from the Serum Institute of India, which has an agreement to manufacture and distribute the shots. A second shipment of 500,000 doses is expected for February. The vaccine requires two doses to reach its full effect.<br />Other countries across Subsaharan Africa and the developing world are likely to emulate South Africa’s decision to bypass local regulators in an effort to expedite getting shots for at least some of their most-at-risk citizens. Some lack their own national drug-approval authorities and are expected to rely on certification from the World Health Organization for rolling out Covid-19 vaccines.<br />The shots South Africa has ordered from India will be given to health care workers, who have borne the brunt of a surge in new cases of Covid-19. Researchers believe that the new wave in infections has been exacerbated by a new, likely more transmissible variant of the coronavirus discovered in the country. In December alone, 5,000 health care workers tested positive for the disease, placing an additional burden on hospitals already struggling.<br />South Africa, a country of 60 million people, reported on Wednesday 21,832 fresh cases of Covid-19, its highest daily count, and 392 deaths. Nearly one-third of coronavirus tests are coming back positive—an indication that the true number of infections is likely much higher—and the South African Medical Research Council said it recorded nearly 7,000 excess deaths in the week of Christmas, most of them likely due to Covid-19.</td>

I watched him drop spoons from his high chair over and over again, each time checking that they’d relocated to the ground. Every parent (or grandparent) has seen such comical yet deeply serious “experiments.”<br />Through these investigations, babies learn how to translate the jumble of photons that pass through our tiny pupils and impinge on our two-dimensional retinas into the three-dimensional world of objects that we navigate in everyday life. Other babyish meditations build up our concept of self and our explanatory models of other minds inside other bodies. These are great achievements. Researchers in artificial intelligence have struggled to replicate them, with limited success.<br />To understand reality, it’s efficient and reasonable for children to take lessons from the way things behave in the everyday world. But our eyes can’t perceive distant galaxies or the atoms and molecules that build up matter. The electromagnetic waves that power radios and microwave ovens pass unnoticed, as do the electric flows that power our muscles and encode our thoughts. We do not have the infrared vision of snakes, the ultraviolet vision of bees, or bats’ ability to pick up ultrasound.<br />The physical world revealed by modern science is fundamentally different from the model we construct as babies. Scientific instruments let us perceive the world better than we can using only our bodies. We can use microscopes, telescopes, spectroscopes, magnetometers, particle accelerators, atomic clocks and other tools to explore the physical world’s reality.</td>

In 2019, she became the director of California’s Office of the Small Business Advocate, where she helped implement a grant program for businesses affected by the pandemic.<br />If confirmed, Ms. Guzman would lead an agency that is best known for its loan programs to provide small firms with capital and has more recently helped businesses affected by the pandemic. Many of the agency’s loan programs rely on partnerships with banks and other financial institutions, which issue the loans and receive an SBA guarantee.<br />The agency, created in 1953, also offers programs to help small businesses win federal contracting opportunities and funds local centers where entrepreneurs receive counseling, technical assistance and other support. Through its Office of Advocacy, the SBA also aims to advance small-business interests throughout the federal government.<br />The relatively small bureaucracy played a key role in the federal government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. The SBA administered the popular Paycheck Protection Program, which provided coronavirus aid in the form of forgivable loans to small businesses, nonprofits and self-employed entrepreneurs.</td>

      <td>Last quarter’s numbers for the retailer look worse than they are, but there still are good reasons to approach with caution</td>
      <td>Bed Bath & Beyond has really started to spruce the place up. It is a shame its housewarming party drew so few guests.<br />The retailer logged a 5% decline in total revenue and a 2% gain in comparable-store sales in the quarter ended Nov. 28. Both figures were lower than what analysts polled by FactSet had expected. Furthermore, the company posted a net loss of $75.4 million. Analysts had expected a profit.<br />The disappointing numbers are partly a result of Bed Bath & Beyond’s housecleaning efforts, which could make numbers worse before they get better. Without impacts from divestitures and store closures, the company would have posted a positive bottom line.<br />Below the surface, the company is showing signs of improvement. Gross margins, for example, improved by more than 3 percentage points last quarter compared with the same period a year earlier and held steady from the preceding quarter. That is actually quite a feat considering that sales were weaker compared with both periods and a much higher share of the retailer’s sales today come from e-commerce.<br />Digital sales surged 77% year over year for the entire company, which includes Buy Buy Baby. Expanding gross margins are a solid sign that the retailer has gotten savvier about promotions and merchandising. The other number to watch is the retailer’s inventory turnover, a measure of how quickly it sells and replaces items. That metric improved last quarter both compared with the prior quarter and a year earlier.</td>

      <td>For the recurring series, That’s Debatable, we take on a contentious issue of the day and present two spirited arguments—one in favor and other emphatically opposed. Previous installments from the series are here.<br />Having a stranger touch your face in a tiny, enclosed space sounds like a social-distancing nightmare today. Just a year ago, however, some people equated it with relaxation bliss. When they’d walk into a facialist’s studio and catch the aroma of rose or bergamot, all their built-up tension would melt away. That particular form of Zen might be eluding fragrance fans in 2021, but many are still turning to scented lotions, face masks and more to conjure spalike calm in the sterile safety of their bathrooms.<br />According to some beauty devotees, aromatics amp up an otherwise lackluster at-home routine. “Like a very luxe store or restaurant…[a skin-care regimen] is about the experience as much as a result,” said Phoebe Hausser, 25, who works in social-media marketing in Birmingham, Ala. She’s partial to botanic scents, like that of  Shiseido ’s  Eudermine Revitalizing Essence lotion.<br />For others, aroma enhances the “treat yourself” aspect of skin care. “You can find some really nice herbal scents” in creams and serums, said Alexis Hester, 34, a Houston attorney. “I love lemongrass and eucalyptus…You feel like you’ve just walked out of the spa.” Ms. Hester can even be transported by a tomato-based Burt’s Bees toner. If you close your eyes and inhale, you might feel like you’re in a vegetable garden—or, as Ms. Hester put it, a Whole Foods.<br />Many people—even those who enjoy olfactory stimulation—find scented skin care overpowering and unnecessary. “I already have perfume,” said Jane Lappin, 65, an automated-vehicle safety consultant in Belmont, Mass., who “recoils” from scented facial products. “Why would I put anything onto my skin that isn’t specifically enhancing its appearance or longevity?”</td>

      <td>Workers continued to apply for unemployment aid at an elevated level at the end of 2020 and holiday-season demand for imported consumer products pushed the November trade deficit in goods to a record, signs of the uneven economic recovery.<br />Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits from regular state programs, a proxy for layoffs, fell by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 787,000 in the week ended Jan. 2, the Labor Department said Thursday. The prior week’s figure was revised up by 3,000. Unemployment claims have been holding at about four times their pre-pandemic average through the fall and into the winter.<br />The foreign-trade gap for goods in November was the highest on records going back to 1992. The overall deficit for goods and services expanded a seasonally adjusted 8% from October to the highest level since August 2006, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The data reflects that consumers’ demand for imports outpaced global demand for U.S. exports.<br />Job losses in the past year have been particularly severe among lower-earning restaurant, hotel and mall-retail workers. Meanwhile, workers in other areas were more likely to shift to working from home and have maintained incomes to help drive demand for goods, while spending less on dining out, travel and other services.<br />Imports of consumer goods reached the highest level on record in November, led by increased shipments of cellphones, appliances, jewelry and toys, the Commerce Department said.</td>

      <td>New technology makes it possible to create videos that show a person doing or saying anything the creator wants—and it’s not clear what U.S. law can do about it.</td>
      <td>Last month, the British television network Channel 4 broadcast an “alternative Christmas address” by Queen Elizabeth II, in which the 94-year-old monarch was shown cracking jokes and performing a dance popular on TikTok. Of course, it wasn’t real: The video was produced as a warning about deepfakes—apparently real images or videos that show people doing or saying things they never did or said. If an image of a person can be found, new technologies using artificial intelligence and machine learning now make it possible to show that person doing almost anything at all. The dangers of the technology are clear: A high-school teacher could be shown in a compromising situation with a student, a neighbor could be depicted as a terrorist.<br />Can deepfakes, as such, be prohibited under American law? Almost certainly not. In U.S. v. Alvarez, decided in 2012, a badly divided Supreme Court held that the First Amendment prohibits the government from regulating speech simply because it is a lie. The case concerned a man who falsely claimed that he was a recipient of the Medal of Honor. Lying about receiving that medal is a crime under the 2006 Stolen Valor Act, but the Supreme Court struck down the key provision of that law, ruling that the lie was protected by the First Amendment. The plurality opinion declared that “permitting the government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense…would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about which false statements are punishable. That governmental power has no clear limiting principle…. Were this law to be sustained, there could be an endless list of subjects the National Government or the States could single out.”<br />Under existing law, a key question is whether deepfakes cause sufficient harm. If they are libelous, they could be regulated under current legal standards, which allow plaintiffs to recover damages when, for example, a speaker hurts their reputation by spreading what the speaker knows to be a lie.<br />But deepfakes need not be libelous. They might be positive, making people look impressive or wonderful. A deepfake might be used, say, to advertise an energy pill by showing an 80-year-old man taking the pill and then dunking a basketball like LeBron James. And if a deepfake shows a politician doing something amazing or heroic, there’s no libel.<br />Does the government have the right to ban these kinds of deepfakes? According to the plurality opinion in Alvarez, “The remedy for speech that is false is speech that is true. This is the ordinary course in a free society.” By this standard, the best response to many deepfakes is a smile and a laugh—or counter-speech and disclosure—rather than censorship. Social media platforms are not bound by the First Amendment, but in cases in which people could be misled, such platforms might want to label deepfakes as such, but not take them down, certainly as a matter of course.  Twitter  has voluntarily adopted an approach of this kind, potentially adding labels to manipulated media but taking down tweets that contain them only if they are “likely to cause harm.”</td>

      <td>In his critique of the Justice Department’s suit against  Walmart  for fueling the opioid crisis (“A Case Against Walmart Mocks Justice,” op-ed, Dec. 28), Michael Krauss writes, “State laws require pharmacists to fill prescriptions that have been validly written by qualified medical practitioners. Pharmacists lack the expertise to second-guess doctors’ judgments about the appropriate necessity of a medication and the proper dosing for a particular patient.”<br />The prospective drug-utilization-review provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, however, require pharmacists to evaluate prescribed medication to ensure it is “appropriate, medically necessary, and not likely to result in adverse events.” Ensuring pharmacists are proficient at fulfilling this responsibility is core to the training of every pharmacist.<br />The pharmacy practice act in every state actually requires the pharmacist to judge the appropriateness of the medication order and take appropriate action to ensure patient safety, including refusing to dispense the prescription, if necessary. Requiring the clinical indication or diagnosis be placed on every prescription order would dramatically improve pharmacists’ ability to fulfill this essential legal and professional responsibility.<br />Prof. Michael T.

Hunting isn’t a sport, it’s a violent and unnecessary form of entertainment. Hunters cause animals unimaginable suffering, especially when you consider that multiple studies have found that bow hunters wound but don’t kill their targets about half the time. They tear families apart, orphan the young and, for animals including wolves and geese who mate for life and live in close-knit family groups, destroy entire communities. And animals don’t need hunters to manage their herds. Deer reproduce based on food and habitat availability, so when more resources become available due to hunting, deer multiply at higher rates. Natural predators do help maintain healthy populations, selecting the sickest and weakest animals. But hunters go after the largest set of antlers to hang on their walls. “Game” managers also frequently kill off natural predators to ensure plenty of targets for hunters to shoot at.<br />Michelle Kretzer<br />People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Foundation<br />Norfolk, Va.<br /></td>

      <td>Traders and investment bankers have flourished despite the global economic crisis, turning bonus discussions into a delicate balancing act</td>
      <td>Wall Street banks have had a decent crisis so far. That is unlikely to translate to bumper bonus payments for bankers and traders, as chief executives and boards grapple with the optics of big payouts amid economic hardship on Main Street.<br />At Bank of America Corp. the bonus pool is likely to be flat, according to people familiar with the bank’s plans. Bonuses for some  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. traders are expected to rise, according to a person familiar with the situation, but not as much as the 39% increase in trading revenues at the New York-based bank in the first nine months of 2020.  Morgan Stanley  has said it would pay $1,000 bonuses to most employees making less than $150,000, but hasn’t given any guidance on payouts for higher-earning staff.<br />“It’s a bad year to have a good year,” said Gilbert Swann, a recruiter at Sheffield Haworth in London whose clients include global investment banks. “It’s not a year that people are going to get paid significantly up, so flat might be the new up.”<br />Payouts to bankers and traders are especially contentious this bonus season. Millions lost their jobs as economies were closed and businesses were bankrupted in the coronavirus pandemic. But the banking sector has largely withstood the crisis thanks to trillions of dollars of funding and support for borrowers from governments and central banks. Investment bank revenue surged as trading increased in volatile markets and companies raised fresh debt and equity.<br />Now, traders and bankers expect to be rewarded for their efforts. That is creating a dilemma for chief executives and boards who worry about how their companies are perceived by politicians, regulators and the taxpayers who will be paying for the crisis for years to come. Even the best performers may find their bonuses curtailed because of this public-perception problem.</td>

      <td>Health insurers and pharmacies have less to fear from business and regulatory threats</td>
      <td>Health-care incumbents are making big moves right as would-be disrupters fade away.<br />The new year has begun with a bang for deal makers.  UnitedHealth Group ,  the largest publicly traded health insurer, announced a deal on Wednesday to buy health technology startup  Change Healthcare  for $8 billion in cash.<br />Pharmacy giant  Walgreens Boots Alliance  also said Wednesday that it is selling its European distribution business to drug wholesaler  AmerisourceBergen  for $6.5 billion in cash and stock. Both Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen shares surged on Wednesday. And insurer Centene said on Monday it plans to acquire mental-health-care specialist Magellan for $2.2 billion.<br />It won’t be surprising if more deals materialize soon: The annual  J.P. Morgan  health conference, which historically has been a preferred moment for splashy announcements, is scheduled for next week.<br />The shopping spree coincides with the dissipation of potentially disruptive threats that have spooked Wall Street in the past. Haven Health, a venture aimed at reducing health costs backed by  JPMorgan Chase ,   Berkshire Hathaway  and  Amazon.com ,  is folding roughly three years after its formation, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Haven’s arrival caused a selloff for insurance stocks back in 2018. Despite the fanfare and pedigree, the group found American health care too hard of a nut to crack.</td>
