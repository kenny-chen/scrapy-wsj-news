      <td>Singapore Food Agency deems Eat Just’s no-slaughter product safe for human consumptions</td>
      <td>California food company Eat Just Inc. won Singapore government approval to sell chicken grown from poultry cells, a step forward for a nascent technology that aims to revolutionize meat production.<br />The Singapore Food Agency, which oversees food safety and security in the country, deemed the chicken—produced using cell-culture technology—safe for human consumption at the levels Eat Just intends to use in chicken nuggets. The agency said the meat can be sold in Singapore as an ingredient in Eat Just’s nuggets product.<br />Eat Just said the approval followed two years of discussion and review. It opens the way for the first commercial sales of such cell-cultured meat, which uses self-replicating animal cells to grow muscle tissue that can be harvested as meat.<br />Developers have said the technology still is in its infancy, and producing meat in bioreactor tanks from animal cells remains far more expensive than raising and slaughtering chickens, cattle and hogs. The technology has drawn investments from major meatpackers like Cargill Inc. and  Tyson Foods Inc.,  as well as such investors as Bill Gates and Richard Branson.<br />Proponents say the method can ease the environmental impact of producing meat for a growing world population, though farmers and ranchers have been skeptical of consumers’ appetite for hamburgers and chicken breasts developed in laboratories.</td>

      <td>The unanimous vote in the House of Representatives to approve legislation that would likely lead to the delisting of hundreds of Chinese companies trading in the U.S. is a symbolic blow to financial relations between the two countries.<br />But it isn’t the same sort of material blow to China Inc.’s ability to raise capital that it would have been when the subject was discussed a decade ago.<br />When the subject reached the attention of the House financial-services committee in 2010, it was years before the launch of the two Hong Kong Stock Connect channels, which allow investors based in the city to buy stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen.<br />The value of those A-shares held by foreigners has risen to new records repeatedly this year. As of the end of November, the figure reached about $354 billion, up 65% year-over-year. That’s still less than 4% of the total market, leaving considerable room to grow.<br />There is very little indication that companies would be unduly damaged or restrained if they had to rely on Hong Kong listings. Most major Wall Street investors have outposts in Hong Kong and could easily purchase any delisted company’s secondary-listed stocks there.</td>

      <td>New applications for unemployment benefits fell last week after a recent jump, an indication that the labor market recovery is navigating through new virus-related restrictions in some states.<br />Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits, a proxy for layoffs, fell by 75,000 to a seasonally adjusted 712,000 in the week ended Nov. 28, the Labor Department said Thursday. That follows two consecutive increases and comes amid evidence that the economy continues to recover from the spring’s shutdowns, but at a slower pace. The previous week’s level was higher than any recorded before this year, but well down from a peak of nearly 7 million in late March.<br />The weekly claims data, which policy makers and investors have relied on throughout the pandemic for timely information about the labor market, came under scrutiny this week after a government watchdog said the data were flawed. The Government Accountability Office said in a report that states have provided inconsistent data to the Labor Department and incidents of fraud have distorted the numbers.<br />The Labor Department agreed to clarify how jobless claims are counted in the weekly jobless-claims report, but an agency spokeswoman said the department didn’t anticipate any changes in methodology.<br />Other recent data, from the Commerce Department, suggest the economic recovery from the spring’s shutdowns has continued. Consumer spending and retail sales both rose in October, though at a slower pace compared with prior months. Sales of newly built homes in October remained near their highest level in more than a decade.</td>

Nasdaq-100 futures edged 0.2% higher, pointing to a muted advance in tech stocks after the opening bell.<br />Trading has been choppy this week as November’s explosive rally in global stocks lost steam. The S&P 500 has repeatedly eked out fresh records on the back of investors’ optimism that Covid-19 vaccines will accelerate the economic rebound next year. But rich valuations for stocks and elevated infection levels are tempering some of that cheer, leading to a more subdued move upward in recent days.<br />“Markets have been driving higher, seeing 2021 as the year economies will snap back,” said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank. “There is concern a lot of the good news is already priced in, so I don’t expect markets to go shooting into the stratosphere any time soon, but we could see a general grind higher.”<br />Ahead of the market open, Tesla gained over 4%. A Goldman Sachs analyst upgraded the stock’s rating to buy and raised the price target. Tesla will be added to the S&P 500 later this month, which would prompt passive funds that track the index to add the stock to their portfolios.</td>

It previously said it would spend $19 billion to $22 billion a year through 2024 before the pandemic, while returning as much as $80 billion to shareholders over that period.<br />The reductions by the U.S. oil giant follow those announced this week by rival  Exxon Mobil Corp. , which on Monday said it was reducing its yearly capital spending by about $5 billion to $10 billion each year through 2025. Exxon, which has lost more than $2.3 billion over the first three quarters of this year, also said it would slash the book value of its assets by up to $20 billion.<br />Chevron has lost nearly $5 billion this year, but unlike Exxon has managed to avoid taking on large amounts of new debt due to a relatively strong balance sheet. The company’s share price is down about 5% over the last six months and closed at $89.87 Wednesday.<br />“Chevron remains committed to capital discipline with a 2021 capital budget and longer-term capital outlook that are well below our prior guidance,” Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth said.</td>

      <td>Criminal gangs will likely attempt to get their hands on supplies of new Covid-19 vaccines, international police organization Interpol warned, potentially disrupting supplies of the crucial shots as they become available.<br />The agency issued a global orange notice—which it describes as a serious and imminent threat to public safety—to its 194 members, calling the vaccines “liquid gold,” and warned counterfeit vaccines or coronavirus tests could become a growing problem as international travel gradually resumes in the months to come.<br />“As governments are preparing to roll out vaccines, criminal organizations are planning to infiltrate or disrupt supply chains,” Interpol Secretary-General Jürgen Stock said late Wednesday. “It is essential that law enforcement is as prepared as possible for what will be an onslaught of all types of criminal activity linked to the Covid-19 vaccine.”<br />Interpol issued the warning after the U.K. became the first country to grant emergency-use authorization for a vaccine. Developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ,  rollout could start next week. Regulators in the U.S. and other countries are now evaluating the new two-shot vaccine and other candidates before authorizing them for distribution. Over 3,000 people were reported to have died from Covid-19 in the U.S. on Wednesday, the highest figure since the pandemic began. Pfizer has already begun shipping shots to distribution sites in anticipation of gaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration, which is planning to review the vaccine on Dec. 10 and could authorize its use soon after.<br />However, criminals would face the same logistical challenges as the drug companies in shipping and storing the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and another candidate produced by  Moderna Inc.</td>

Officials organized test runs to refine the logistics of delivering a shot that, in the case of the vaccine developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ,  has to be stored at an ultralow temperature. The government changed the law to allow student doctors, physiotherapists and dental workers to administer the jab. Scientists advising the government have drawn up a provisional list of who should get vaccinated first.<br />The scale and urgency of the task is such that the NHS, already under enormous pressure because of the pandemic, has appealed for retired doctors and nurses to rejoin the service and for thousands of volunteers to train as vaccinators and support staff.<br />The project will be “the biggest vaccination campaign in our history,” NHS Chief Executive Simon Stevens said Wednesday.<br />One major help: Vaccine skepticism is lower in the U.K. than in many other Western countries. A survey by Ipsos in October showed 79% of Britons would get Covid-19 shots if available, compared with 64% in the U.S. and 54% in France.</td>

Now, the Italian fashion house is embracing Princess Diana and Jackie O.<br />Gucci is courting older, wealthier clientele to stabilize revenue as its five-year run of remarkable growth, fueled by younger shoppers, peters out. Creative Director Alessandro Michele—hailed as a visionary for eclectic, pop-culture infused designs that ignited up social media and attracted millennials and Gen Z—is shifting to more subtle designs that play on the brand’s decades of heritage.<br />“They are going after the largest, yet most neglected, segment of luxury buyers—baby boomers,” said Pauline Brown, professor at Columbia Business School and former head of the North American division of LVMH Moët Hennessy  Louis Vuitton  SE, one of Gucci’s major rivals.<br />“Older consumers not only have the means to buy their products, but they’re living longer, healthier, more fashionable lives,” she said.<br />Executives at Gucci and its parent,  Kering SA,  say they are counting on the new aesthetic to broaden the label’s client base and drive growth, following a four-year run from 2015 when revenue more than doubled. That plan has grown more urgent since the pandemic, as revenue plunged and flocks of tourists from abroad—avid Gucci customers—stayed at home. When a second wave of lockdowns swept the West, brands across the luxury sector scrambled to replace the tourist revenue.</td>

A United cardholder for roughly 15 years, Ms. Moore traveled often. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit and Ms. Moore, 53 years old, scaled back her spending and canceled travel plans.<br />Ms. Moore, a senior director at a national health care organization in Washington, D.C., decided to keep the card after JPMorgan offered her a $200 statement credit. But she has barely used the card since, and is instead mostly using debit cards.<br />Nearly nine months into the pandemic, banks and airlines are scrambling to rescue their airline rewards cards. The companies have deployed the cards for years to win big-spending customers, but the perks they offer—like flight upgrades and airport lounge access—are all but obsolete in a global pandemic.<br />Typically, card companies don’t disclose the volume of spending on their airline cards versus other, more general-purpose cards. But travel purchases were down about 70% on  Visa Inc.  cards in the last quarter compared with a year ago. Travel and entertainment purchases were down 69% on  American Express Co.  cards.<br />Other categories are faring better.

The result is that while Europe’s largest economies are likely to contract in the final quarter of the year, the recovery in Asia’s largest economies is set to continue.<br />Data firm  IHS Markit  Thursday said its Purchasing Managers Index for the eurozone’s services sector fell to 41.7 in November from 46.9 in October, its lowest level since May. A reading below 50.0 points to a decline in activity, while a reading above that threshold points to an increase.<br />Similar surveys for the U.S. to be released later Thursday are expected to point to a strong rise in activity.</td>

Prosecutors said the national-security investigation is continuing and opposed bail for the 73-year-old, according to local media. Magistrate Victor So Wai-tak declined bail while setting the next court appearance for April 16, meaning Mr. Lai will be held for 4½ months in prison. Cheung Kim-hung, the chief executive of Apple Daily parent Next Digital, said Mr. Lai will appeal.<br />The decision comes a day after Joshua Wong, a leading face of Hong Kong’s protest movement, was sentenced to more than a year in prison for inciting and organizing a demonstration last year. Fellow activists Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam were also given prison sentences.<br />The indictment against Mr. Lai and Next Digital senior executives Chow Tat-kuen and Wong Wai-keung alleges that a property leased by an Apple Daily-affiliated company from a Hong Kong government entity hadn’t been used as intended, and the trio were in breach of the lease.

Early holiday sales data are encouraging, suggesting Etsy could continue to climb, buoyed by more-sustainable categories and a defensible business model.<br />In its third-quarter report, Etsy said masks’ percentage of gross merchandise sales had dropped to 11%. It cited a steady monthly deceleration, expecting mask sales to be substantially lower in the fourth quarter compared with a quarter earlier.<br />Still, data from Edison Trends show that Etsy expanded online customer spending on Cyber Monday by 73% year-over-year—well ahead of top retailers such as  Target  and  Amazon ,  at 43% and 19%, respectively.<br />Since it is unlikely that masks were a big holiday gift draw, Etsy’s recent growth seems to imply broad interest in nonmask products that can continue after the coronavirus pandemic subsides. Etsy says that “personalized gift” has actually been the most-searched term on its site this year and that top sellers throughout its recent cyber week sale included such things as custom ornaments and blankets.</td>

      <td><br />Stockbridge Capital Group and a South Korean partner said Wednesday they have acquired a portfolio of 23 warehouses in the U.S. in one the largest commercial real estate sales of the year.<br />The transaction, which a person familiar with the matter said amounted to about $2 billion, is the latest indication of continued strong demand for industrial properties amid the rising popularity of e-commerce. Stockbridge’s partner in the deal is the National Pension Service of Korea.<br />While the Covid-19 pandemic and recession have slammed offices, hotels and retail properties, the industrial property sector so far appears relatively unscathed.<br />A pandemic-driven surge in online orders has led to delivery backlogs and rising demand for warehouses near big population centers to store and process goods. That, in return, is attracting deep-pocketed investors looking for properties to buy.</td>

      <td>The coronavirus pandemic has reshaped the 2020 holiday shopping season, with more people buying gifts online and fewer visiting stores. Retailers pushed discounts into October and put their Black Friday deals online. The big shift to e-commerce will test shipping networks in December.<br />The Wall Street Journal is tracking how consumers are spending their money this year. See how the holiday retail season is unfolding below.<br />Data from credit-card transactions show that while shoppers are spending about the same amount of money in person as they did last year, they are spending more online. On Black Friday, electronics stores saw almost four times as much revenue from online credit-card purchases as they did in 2019.<br />Other data trackers say U.S. shoppers are spending less than last year. According to a survey by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics, consumers spent an average of just under $312 on holiday-related purchases from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, down 14% from 2019 but on par with 2018.<br /></td>

      <td>The race to develop the first Covid-19 vaccines has been decided. The battle for market share is just beginning.<br />Regulators in the U.K. have authorized  Pfizer  and  BioNTech ’s  Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, and U.S. regulators are scheduled to complete their own review as soon as late next week. U.S. vaccinations should begin shortly afterward, and regulators will likely authorize  Moderna ’s  vaccine before Christmas.<br />Both vaccines have been shown to be more than 90% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in late stage clinical trials, which raises the bar that future candidates will need to meet. A vaccine developed by Oxford University and  AstraZeneca  has shown far less impressive results. Investors have voted with their wallets: BioNTech’s New York-traded shares have rallied more than 30% over the past month, while Moderna’s stock has more than doubled over that same period.<br />That reaction makes some sense: After all, initial doses will be sold directly to governments at fixed prices, which means that huge profits are likely next year. And the success of the vaccine programs bodes well for other treatments the companies are developing that rely on similar technology.<br />Still, investors expecting that these two companies will dominate this huge market indefinitely are getting ahead of themselves. Key questions about the long-run value of each vaccine program are yet to be resolved.</td>

Mourinho was already a soccer movie star.<br />José Mourinho has been playing the role of José Mourinho for so long now that it’s hard to tell where the veteran soccer manager ends and the rule-breaking, smirking caricature begins. Especially when Mourinho does things like hold an illegal workout in a London park during Britain’s spring lockdown. Or lose a bet to one of his players and shell out $650 for an Iberian ham.<br />The act can be grating to fans of any club that he isn’t currently coaching. But Mourinho is reminding them why he gets away with it nearly two decades after he first shook up European soccer. Underneath the caricature, there remains a serial winner. Ten games into the season, he has Tottenham at the top of the Premier League and mounting a genuine title challenge.</td>

Their stated grounds is that Ms. Shelton is a threat to Fed independence. That argument is worth addressing, especially as the Biden Administration prepares to take power.<br />“I oppose the nomination of Judy Shelton because I am not convinced that she supports the independence of the Federal Reserve Board as much as I believe the Board of Governors should,” Sen. Lamar Alexander said in a recent statement. “I don’t want to turn over management of the money supply to a Congress and a President who can’t balance the federal budget.”<br />Mr. Alexander is retiring at the end of this Congress and on Wednesday he gave a wise and entertaining farewell address (see nearby). But on Ms. Shelton and Fed independence, we’re sorry to say he has it backward. The Fed needs Ms. Shelton’s voice because the Fed is already sacrificing its independence.<br />Take Mr. Alexander’s point about Congress and the President failing to balance the budget. True enough. But the Fed has willingly become the chief enabler of that failure. By keeping interest rates near zero for most of the last 11 years, and buying Treasury bonds and mortgage securities in the trillions of dollars seemingly without end, the Fed is reducing the cost of financing federal debt.<br />This policy has sometimes been warranted—notably in the financial panic and recession of 2008-2009 and again amid the pandemic. But is it always warranted—and for as far into the future as the Fed can see? That’s close to the view of current Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed governors who have said they won’t change monetary policy until 2023.</td>

It concluded that census officials have identified at least 15 anomalies in the data that affect more than one million census records. It said the bureau needs until Feb. 3 to transmit data the president called for in a memorandum requesting that unauthorized immigrants be excluded from the count.<br />State population totals are required by law to be delivered to the president by Dec. 31. He must deliver them to the newly elected House within a week of its opening, which normally occurs Jan. 3.<br />Signs that the timeline would slip emerged last month. Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham said in mid-November that anomalies had been discovered in processing.

The following is from the legendary investor’s 2006 letter to shareholders in  Berkshire Hathaway ’s  annual report:<br />“In selecting a new director, we were guided by our long-standing criteria, which are that board members be owner-oriented, business-savvy, interested and truly independent. . . .<br />“Charlie [Munger, Berkshire vice chairman] and I believe our four criteria are essential if directors are to do their job—which, by law, is to faithfully represent owners. Yet these criteria are usually ignored. Instead, consultants and CEOs seeking board candidates will often say, ‘We’re looking for a woman,’ or ‘a Hispanic,’ or ‘someone from abroad,’ or what have you. It sometimes sounds as if the mission is to stock Noah’s ark. Over the years I’ve been queried many times about potential directors and have yet to hear anyone ask, ‘Does he think like an intelligent owner?’</td>

      <td>In today’s Hong Kong, promoting democracy makes you a criminal.</td>
      <td>No one is better known across the world for advocating democracy in Hong Kong than Jimmy Lai. So when Hong Kong police picked him up Wednesday on dubious fraud charges, China was sending a clear message: If you oppose us anywhere in the world, we will crush you.<br />In Mr. Lai’s case the decision to arrest him over the terms of a business lease sends the additional message that any charges will do. Though the fraud charge is not as serious as some of the others he already faces, especially on national security, its purpose is to dirty him up before he goes to trial on the others.<br />It’s no coincidence he was detained the same day three other pro-democracy champions—Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam—pleaded guilty and were sentenced to prison for participating in 2019 protests against a proposed extradition law. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rightly denounced the sentences as “appalling.”<br />We trust Joe Biden is paying attention. No doubt he’s not eager to start trouble with China. But Chinese leader Xi Jinping has his own priorities. He is testing whether a Biden Administration—especially one seeking a climate accord—will look the other way on China’s behavior in Hong Kong and elsewhere.<br />The Trump Administration, in particular Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has spoken up for Mr. Lai. The Administration has also sanctioned Chinese and Hong Kong officials for “undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy and restricting the freedom of expression or assembly of the citizens of Hong Kong.”</td>

      <td>Federal relief so far has exceeded expectations, and a new round could sustain growth until vaccines arrive.</td>
      <td>Thanks to the underlying strength of the Trump economy on the eve of this pandemic, America’s economic recovery to date has exceeded even the most optimistic forecasts. With several mass-produced vaccines now in sight, it is essential that Congress provide a timely, targeted and temporary fiscal bridge to ensure that American households and firms have the support they need to keep the recovery on pace.<br />This year the U.S. economy was hit by the worst macroeconomic shock in almost a century. Real gross domestic product in the second quarter fell 31.4% at an annual rate. Unemployment jumped to 14.7% between February and April as more than 20 million Americans lost jobs.<br />Thanks to unprecedented action by the Trump administration and Congress, the unemployment rate is now 6.9%. Real GDP growth is on pace to end the year down by about 2 percentage points. While substantial, that would be a smaller contraction than in 2008, and only one-fifth of the drop predicted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.<br />This robust recovery notwithstanding, the U.S. still faces significant headwinds from the pandemic, which has restructured transportation, entertainment, hotels, restaurants and commercial real estate. Adding to these structural woes is the prospect of renewed lockdowns across the 50 states.<br />Timely, targeted relief would do more than sustain the swift recovery of the labor market. It would also help realign federal receipts and outlays more quickly, as nothing blows a hole in long-run fiscal sustainability like a large, persistent output gap.</td>

      <td>America’s political attention is now focused not on Washington but Georgia, 700 miles south, where a Jan. 5 runoff election will decide that state’s two U.S. Senate seats—and with them, which party controls the upper chamber.<br />These runoffs are required by Georgia law because no Senate candidate received 50% of the vote in November. Since Republicans on Jan. 3 will have 50 Senate seats while Democrats will hold 48, the GOP can take control of the chamber by winning one of the seats. But it appears there will be little ticket splitting. Both seats are likely to go to the same party.<br />If Democrats win both, they will control the Senate, since Vice President Kamala Harris can break the 50-50 tie. If Republicans win both, they will keep the Senate and be in an excellent position to halt the Biden administration’s more extreme proposals.<br />What little polling there is suggests it will be close. Each party’s base is motivated, and while turnout will be down from November, it will still be large. Both sides will also have enough money. (As chairman of the Georgia Battleground Fund benefiting Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, I’m working to ensure Republicans do.)<br />Democrats have some advantages going into the runoff. In November their presidential candidate carried Georgia for the first time since 1992. Their defeated gubernatorial candidate from 2018, Stacey Abrams, has built a formidable get-out-the-vote operation. And the state’s demographic changes favor Democrats.</td>

      <td>Portugal’s strongman didn’t go in for bombastic display or ideological extremes. Franco thought his only fault was his modesty.</td>
      <td>If Americans know of António de Oliveira Salazar at all, most do so unwittingly—and thanks to “Casablanca.” Although never mentioned by name in the film, the Portuguese dictator was its hero. His Portugal was stubbornly neutral during World War II, which is why two of the movie’s characters risked their lives to fly from a colonial outpost of Vichy France to the safety of Lisbon. As the Nazis overran Europe, the Portuguese capital became a sanctuary from which refugees escaped to America.<br />Salazar came to power in 1932, aged only 43, in an era when Europe bristled with dictators. The Portuguese strongman was the lone “benevolent autocrat” in a cohort that comprised Hitler, Mussolini, Franco and Stalin. So reckons Tom Gallagher in “Salazar: The Dictator Who Refused to Die,” a learned and lively biography of a man who governed Portugal for 36 years, running it “very much like a punctilious head butler in charge of a sprawling country estate.”<br />Salazar’s end came not from an uprising but from an accident, in 1968. In one of those cosmic blows that can descend on men who lead lives of obsessive caution, a deck chair in which he was sitting (awaiting a haircut) buckled and collapsed. His head hit a stone floor, and he never fully recovered his faculties. He died two years later, probably unaware, Mr.Gallagher tells us, that he was no longer ruling Portugal.<br />Franco, his Spanish counterpart, believed that Salazar’s “only defect is probably his modesty.” Mr. Gallagher, an emeritus professor of politics at the University of Bradford in the U.K., confirms this trait, without ever casting it in a negative light, describing Salazar as “self-effacing, dedicated to his duties, shunning uniforms or bombastic displays.” Unlike Franco, who could be a panjandrum, Salazar was sober and scholarly—and had he not been quite so dapper might even be considered a nerd. Although he enjoyed the company of women, he never married. Whispers that he had a sexual relationship with his housekeeper of five decades—Maria de Jesus Caetano Freire, or “Dona Maria”—could be said to have been silenced after a postmortem examination in 1981 revealed that she died in a virgin state.<br />Salazar attended a Catholic seminary as a young man, but with his passion for politics, Mr. Gallagher writes, he had doubts that he could “maintain the humility that the church demanded of its shepherds.” He went to the University of Coimbra, Portugal’s pre-eminent educational institution, and rose to become a professor of economics, serving for four years as finance minister in a government that had come to power in a military coup in 1926. If ever a coup were needed, this was the time: Portugal’s monarchy had been toppled in 1910, and the chaotic Portuguese republic saw 44 governments come and go in the space of 16 years.</td>

The fight over China’s resistance to allowing overseas inspections of its companies’ audits has lasted for years but reached a fever pitch during the Trump administration.<br />Under the measure, Chinese companies and their auditors would have three years to comply with the inspections before a trading prohibition could take effect. If a breakthrough looked unlikely, the companies would probably respond ahead of a ban by either going private or moving their listing to a non-U.S. exchange.<br />U.S. regulators are working on another proposal that could allow Chinese auditors to comply with the inspection requirement without violating their home country’s laws, which limit the sharing of information. The Securities and Exchange Commission could issue such a proposal this month, although it wouldn’t immediately take effect.<br />Chinese firms have raised money from U.S. shareholders for years, but their auditors violate a fundamental investor protection: China typically won’t allow American regulators to check their work. Chinese companies including  Luckin Coffee Inc.  have imploded in accounting scandals over the past decade, raising awareness of the audit-inspection gap.</td>

      <td>Michael Morell’s views about interrogation tactics prompt criticism, and a new candidate emerges</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Some Democratic senators have privately expressed concern to Joe Biden’s transition team about the president-elect’s consideration of intelligence veteran Michael Morell to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, citing Mr. Morell’s defense of the spy agency’s interrogation tactics after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Within the past two weeks, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) and Sen. Martin Heinrich (D., N.M.) voiced reservations about Mr. Morell, a former acting director of the CIA who had been widely seen by lawmakers and former officials as a top contender for the job, these people said.<br />Their doubts add to those publicly expressed last week by Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who said he would oppose Mr. Morell’s nomination for the post, which has been left unspecified even as Mr. Biden has moved quickly to name other senior national-security personnel.<br />The behind-the-scenes outreach came as other names have emerged as potential picks for the job, including David Cohen, a former top Treasury Department official who later served as deputy CIA director under President Barack Obama and is being actively considered by Mr. Biden, according to a person familiar with the matter. Unlike Mr. Morell, Mr. Cohen isn’t seen by progressives as someone who has defended the interrogation program.<br />Mr. Cohen, a partner at the WilmerHale law firm, spent much of his government career specializing in sanctions and financial intelligence, overseeing efforts at Treasury to counter money laundering, halt terrorist financing and craft sanctions regimes on Russia, North Korea and other entities. He joined the CIA in 2015, long after the interrogation program ended.</td>

He has announced key cabinet officials and his team has begun coordinating with the Trump administration. Mr. Biden’s transition team didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />“If we are right about the fraud, Joe Biden can’t be president,” Mr. Trump said in the 46-minute recorded speech from the White House Diplomatic Reception Room as he ticked through a slew of statements that have been proved false or that his campaign hasn’t substantiated in court.<br />Mr. Trump asserted that he won the election “without question,” even though the Associated Press said Mr. Biden would receive 306 Electoral College votes, well over the 270 needed to secure the presidency. The six most hotly contested battleground states have all certified their results for Mr. Biden, and Mr. Biden’s lead in the national popular vote currently stands at nearly seven million.</td>

      <td>Two grams of cocaine is easily quartered for four classmates to afford a half-gram each, plenty to get amped up with.</td>
      <td>It’s disingenuous of Seamus R. Fallon (“Oregon Drug Law Change Can Help Families,” Letters, Nov. 24) to insist that two grams of cocaine is one-third the amount a drug dealer would typically carry. What is the source for such a statement? Based on my experience as a high-school teacher, few of the drug users in their teen years are “drug dealers.” They are constant consumers, many on a daily basis, of stimulants of any kind. Two grams of cocaine is easily quartered for four classmates to afford a half-gram each, plenty to get amped up, behind some brewskis, especially for diminutive teen girls. None of the group is “a dealer” in the sense Mr. Fallon proffers his straw man; they are end-users for the dealers.<br />Oregon’s abandonment of its youth to the drug subculture, in looming years of turmoil and despair, will show in time that: “As the twig is bent, so is the tree is inclined.” Can Oregon not see the forest for the trees?<br />J.

      <td>United Parcel Service Inc. imposed shipping restrictions on some large retailers such as  Gap Inc.  and Nike Inc. this week, an early sign that the pandemic-fueled online shopping season is stretching delivery networks to their limits.<br />The delivery giant on Cyber Monday notified drivers across the U.S. to stop picking up packages at six retailers, including L.L. Bean Inc., Hot Topic Inc., Newegg Inc. and  Macy’s Inc.,  according to an internal message viewed by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by UPS workers in different regions. “No exceptions,” the message said.<br />The move comes during a holiday season when retailers are increasingly dependent on delivery companies to move online orders, as store traffic has plummeted during the coronavirus pandemic—a dynamic that has shifted power significantly. UPS and rival  FedEx Corp.  have raised prices and promised to hold merchants to volume agreements.<br />The temporary limits, which some drivers say they haven’t seen during previous holiday seasons, are a sign that UPS is metering the flow of packages into its network to preserve its performance during one of the busiest shipping weeks of the year. The National Retail Federation estimated that online shopping jumped 44% over a recent five-day stretch that included Black Friday and Cyber Monday.<br />A UPS spokesman, without commenting on any customer-specific directive, said the company will pick up packages from customers whose demand exceeded allocated space once more capacity becomes available.</td>

It worked for Mayor Bill de Blasio on gun control in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. City of New York but not for Gov. Andrew Cuomo in Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo. So much for that legal gamesmanship with vital constitutional issues.<br />Unfortunately for Gov. Cuomo in the diocese case, the makeup of the Supreme Court changed and he now has to dine on the proverbial crow despite his dismissive attitude about the court’s decision. Attempting to render the central issue in the case moot by withdrawing the offensive action will no longer be tolerated when a strong constitutional insult is involved. From the main unsigned opinion to the concurring opinions, the majority has made clear it will no longer tolerate the offensive attempt to dodge the crucial constitutional issue. The temporary injunction handed down by the Supreme Court was very important and clips Gov. Cuomo’s ability to promulgate offensive orders unreasonably restrictive of religious rights. All states take notice. Also, Justice Brett Kavanaugh has recently given notice that the Second Amendment issues may soon be revisited.<br />Christopher R. Wood<br />Chester, N.J.<br /></td>

It was the second such attack by bank robbers in Brazil in two days.<br />Carrying military-style weapons, the gang of about 15 men descended on Cametá, a sleepy riverside city of 134,000 people in the Amazon on Tuesday night, killing one resident and injuring another in the 2½-hour attack.<br />“Cametá had never seen something like this,” said Mauricio Melo Mendes Monteiro, the head of the city’s military police force in Pará state.<br />The siege came a day after a gang of 30 heavily armed bank robbers invaded the small city of Criciuma more than 2,000 miles to the south, leaving cash scattered on the city’s streets as they fled the scene. Security experts said it was unlikely to be the same gang, but said it wasn’t clear if they are connected.<br />In Tuesday night’s raid, armed men first targeted Cametá’s military police station, preventing the officers from leaving while the rest of the gang broke into a bank.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Republicans signaled opposition to stripping social-media companies of liability protections as part of an annual defense-policy bill, pushing forward with the legislation despite President Trump’s threat to veto it unless they take that step.<br />Mr. Trump on Tuesday said he would veto the defense legislation if it didn’t repeal Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which gives companies broad immunity for the content they publish from users on their sites. The defense bill includes a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops and authorizes $740 billion for military and national security programs next year. It has passed Congress every year for decades with bipartisan support.<br />Sen. Jim Inhofe (R., Okla.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said a repeal of the social-media immunities wasn’t in the defense bill. Mr. Inhofe said he told Mr. Trump that he opposed including a repeal of Section 230 in the legislation because it “has nothing to do with the military.”<br />“I agree with his sentiments,” Mr. Inhofe said. “We ought to do away with 230. But you can’t do it in this bill. That’s not a part of the bill.”<br />Mr. Trump had previously threatened to veto the defense bill if it included language renaming military bases named after Confederate commanders. Mr. Inhofe said Tuesday that a measure from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) to rename those bases would also be included in the legislation.</td>

      <td>“SO, THIS RECIPE has a back story,” said Matt Kelly, chef-owner of the Spanish restaurant Mateo Tapas, in Durham, N.C. His friend, a North Carolina-based chef who hails from New Orleans, asked Mr. Kelly to do a special dinner. This recipe resulted. A tribute to the chefs’ friendship, “fideuà jambalaya” is a cross between a Catalan fideuà and a jambalaya from New Orleans.<br />Like a paella, but made with toasted pasta bits rather than rice, fideuà typically calls for ultra-fine fideo noodles, but you can also break angel hair pasta into stubby pieces and toast those. The pasta then simmers in a jambalaya-like base of tomatoes, chicken, chorizo, ham, peppers and onions. A generous spoonful of creole seasoning provides kick. (Mr. Kelly favors the Emeril’s Essence brand.) Once the noodles absorb most of the stew’s liquid, the pan slides into the oven to crisp. “You get this great crust on the bottom and browned noodles on top,” said Mr. Kelly. “You want to serve (and cook) this with a cold beer.”<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. economy’s recovery picked up to a “modest or moderate” pace this fall, while growth began to slow in November in parts of the Midwest and Northeast as coronavirus cases proliferated, a Federal Reserve report said Wednesday.<br />The Fed’s periodic compilation of anecdotes from business contacts, known as the Beige Book, said the expansion continued in most of the central bank’s 12 districts across the country. But four regional Fed branches reported “little or no growth,” and four noted that activity began to slow in early November.<br />“Firms’ outlooks remained positive; however, optimism has waned” the report said. “Many contacts cited concerns over the recent pandemic wave, mandated restrictions (recent and prospective), and the looming expiration dates for unemployment benefits and for moratoriums on evictions and foreclosures.”<br />The Fed’s previous Beige Book report characterized economic growth in the early fall as at a “slight to modest” pace.<br />Banks reported deterioration in loan portfolios—particularly commercial lending to retail, hospitality and leisure businesses—and expectations of an uptick in delinquencies became more widespread, the Beige Book added.</td>

They discussed what would become a principle of this season’s thorny finish: the NFL’s long-held obsession with competitive fairness had to go by the wayside.<br />That decision came home to roost over a surreal week that began on Thanksgiving with the postponement of a marquee game; continued on Sunday with one team playing without a quarterback; and concluded with an unusual Wednesday game that featured another team in the midst of a widespread outbreak.<br />“Health and medical decisions have and will always take precedence over competitive considerations,” commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday.<br />His remarks came just two hours before the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers were set to kickoff a game that had been postponed three times because the Ravens continued to register new positive tests for more than a week. The outbreak left the Ravens to play against the NFL’s last undefeated team without MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson, their top two running backs and a host of other starters.<br />The Ravens-Steelers game was supposed to be played on Thanksgiving night, until the cases forced a postponement until Sunday, and then Tuesday and then Wednesday. It wasn’t even confirmed that the game would proceed until shortly after noon Wednesday, just hours before kickoff.</td>

The Senate voted 50-45 to clear a final procedural hurdle before Mr. Waller’s confirmation vote, which is likely to occur Thursday.<br />Mr. Waller, whose term would run through January 2030, has attended meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee this year in his capacity at the St. Louis Fed.

From big-budget movies to lure families over Christmas, to serious-minded films to attract award nominations, they’re appearing on digital platforms, often at the same time (or soon after) they debut in theaters.<br />It’s a tradeoff for filmmakers who know fewer people will see their movies in the ideal setting they had envisioned. “The movie plays much better on a big IMAX screen,” says director Patty Jenkins, whose “Wonder Woman 1984” is hitting theaters and IMAX screens wherever they’re open on Christmas Day, the same time it arrives in living rooms on HBO Max. “Certainly the experience is far better the bigger the TV and the better the sound. It hurts a little bit to think of people watching it on their phone, but they do inevitably anyway.”<br />Even with concerns about the future of the theatrical experience, there is convenience—and a broad selection of projects from some of Hollywood’s biggest talents.

The SBA had previously issued some detailed information for PPP loans above $150,000, though the bulk of the program’s loans were smaller than that.<br />The new data show that 609 companies received the program’s maximum loan amount of $10 million. Such a loan size would indicate a firm had a larger number of employees, since borrowers generally received funding that amounted to roughly two and half times their pre-pandemic average monthly payroll.<br />The data offer the most detailed look yet at the government’s signature coronavirus relief effort for small businesses, just as lawmakers again consider whether to renew the initiative. The program, which started in April, had issued more than five million loans totaling $525 billion when it closed in August.<br />The data also signal the difficulty of tracking borrower information in a massive program where the responsible agency didn’t issue loans directly. Financial institutions processed PPP borrower applications and funded and disbursed the loans, which are backed by the SBA.</td>

They were made to big investors such as  BlackRock Inc.  and banks such as  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and  JPMorgan Chase  & Co.<br />“Our standing approach right now is to continue those calls,” Mr. Lane said in an interview with Reuters published Wednesday on the ECB’s website.<br />“It’s a structured, systematic approach where we rotate across different types of ECB watchers,” Mr. Lane said. “It’s also true that we should always review and keep in mind our communication policy.”</td>

On Nov. 28, government forces claimed to have taken control of the Tigrayan capital of Mekelle, home to 500,000 civilians and thousands of battle-hardened TPLF fighters who had dug trenches and blown up bridges to halt the advance of federal troops. Mr. Ahmed praised Ethiopian forces for restoring order in Mekelle and said his troops had taken great care to avoid civilian casualties.<br />The government troops appear to have faced little resistance. TPLF fighters have likely melted into the civilian population and hide-outs elsewhere in the state, where regional analysts and Western diplomats say they are preparing to mount an armed insurgency. The TPLF has pledged to never surrender and to make Tigray “hell” for the Ethiopian government. The Tigrayan authorities said Nov. 28 that they had shot down an Ethiopian warplane, and local television showed footage of a man it said was the pilot.<br />Tensions between Ethiopia’s federal government in Addis Ababa and the TPLF have been building since Mr. Ahmed became prime minister in 2018. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia’s ruling coalition for nearly three decades, with Tigrayans, who constitute around 6% of Ethiopia’s 110 million people, holding important positions in politics and business. TPLF leaders have accused Mr. Ahmed of sidelining them, while the federal government says the group is trying to divide Ethiopia.<br />Mr. Ahmed’s government has openly targeted prominent Tigrayans. Ethiopia’s army chief has accused the head of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus—who is the highest-profile Tigrayan abroad—of lobbying in favor of the dissident region. Dr. Tedros denied taking sides in the conflict and says he is working for peace.</td>

      <td>Many people are opting for road trips over flights this winter, but icy roads can be risky too. Here, crucial tips from driving experts.</td>
      <td>IF YOU’RE heading over the hills and through the woods this year — not to Grandma’s house, we hope–you’re probably hitting the road. According to a Travelocity survey conducted in October, nearly 80% of respondents traveling over the holidays are planning to drive. For many of the road-trippers who have limited experience traveling snow-packed roads, we asked two pros for tips on how to safely steer away from danger–and not be the confident idiot behind the wheel.<br />Gut reaction Continue along at the same clip. The roads are dry and you’ve got traction, right?<br />What you should actually do “Bridges freeze earliest and melt last,” said Kelsey Mays, vehicle expert and consumer affairs advocate at  Cars.com .  So slow down well in advance of the bridge or overpass. Avoid braking while you’re already driving over either one, leave extra following distance and don’t change lanes, either. “If you’re going too fast, you’ve already made a mistake,” said Nolan Katerberg, U.S. program manager with the training outfit Ford Driving Skills for Life.<br />Gut reaction Swerve to miss it.<br />What you should actually do Go slow, especially during periods of peak animal activity like dusk, to make sure you can have time to safely stop. If you can’t, it sounds heartless, but drive straight toward the animal rather than attempt to swerve to miss it, which can cause you to lose control. New vehicles are designed to absorb head-on impacts to an extent, but hitting an animal sideways can be disastrous. “You can fix a vehicle if you hit the deer, but if you swerve into oncoming traffic and hit a vehicle, there’s a good chance you’ll get hurt,” said Mr. Katerberg.</td>

      <td>Barr makes it harder for a Biden AG to bury the truth about FBI abuses.</td>
      <td>Democrats have tried to draw a curtain over the FBI’s Russia-collusion investigation since their party’s role in that politicized probe came to light. A Biden Administration will have a harder time burying the truth now that Attorney General Bill Barr has made U.S. Attorney John Durham a special counsel.<br />Mr. Barr on Tuesday alerted Congress to his Oct. 19 decision, two weeks before the election, to grant Mr. Durham the status of a special counsel. Mr. Durham has been investigating the decision by the FBI and intelligence agencies to target Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Durham had planned to wrap up this summer, but the pandemic and new discoveries intervened. So Mr. Barr wanted to “provide him and his team with the assurance that they could complete their work, without regard to the outcome of the election,” according to Mr. Barr’s letter to Congress.<br />In other words, he wants to make it harder for the next AG to sack Mr. Durham. Under DOJ regulations, special counsels aren’t subject to “day-to-day supervision” and can only be removed for “misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of department policies.”<br />Democrats were prime movers of the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe, handing the bureau a fictitious dossier that became the basis for secret surveillance warrants, years of media speculation, and special counsel Robert Mueller. Obama officials and Congressional Democrats were part of the spectacle—including some who may want to serve in a Biden Administration. Mr. Biden’s AG will be under pressure to protect reputations by shutting down Mr. Durham before he can issue indictments or an embarrassing report.<br />As President, Mr. Biden could still direct his Attorney General to fire Mr. Durham—but at a high political price. Democrats defended Mr. Mueller’s special-counsel status as crucial to finding the truth. and Mr. Barr said this week that Mr. Durham should be provided the protections of “the same regulation.”</td>

      <td>The party needs to spend the next few years doing more than opposing Medicare for All.</td>
      <td>Republicans and Democrats in Washington are stalemated on health care. Republicans long campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act and won House and Senate seats on the issue in 2010 and later. Democrats flipped the script in 2018 and attacked Republicans for trying to undermine the law’s protections for pre-existing conditions. But for now at least, a President Biden will be unable to pass a “public option,” and Republicans will be unable to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The question the GOP ought to ponder is: What does it want to accomplish on health care?<br />Mr. Biden may make changes on the margins. He might expand ObamaCare by adding special enrollment periods, banning short-term health plans, automating enrollment for low-income beneficiaries in states that haven’t expanded Medicaid, or by making subsidies more generous. Republicans will likely continue challenging the law in court.<br />Opposition to ObamaCare and a single-payer health system kept Republicans united but unprepared to act when they controlled the White House, House and Senate in 2017. The GOP repealed the individual mandate penalty, health-insurance tax, medical-device tax and Cadillac tax, but the Affordable Care Act remains largely intact. Conservatives must now use their time to prepare, so they won’t be caught flat-footed next time they are in charge. Consider three questions:<br />• Do conservatives continue fighting for a full repeal of ObamaCare spending and taxes, or do they accept current spending as the baseline? Republicans have a history of saying they want to repeal ObamaCare, but using some of the dollars on other health-care priorities, and spending the rest on balancing the budget. Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy proposed block-granting the law’s Medicaid spending to states. Some Republicans have proposed redeploying ObamaCare’s exchange subsidies and Medicaid funding into more market-friendly refundable tax credits and high-risk pools.<br />It is easier politically to spend money differently than to spend less, or to try to offset some of the spending with savings elsewhere in the budget. The Congressional Budget Office won’t score enough savings through various fraud and waste initiatives to fund the significant coverage subsidies many Republicans want to offer voters accustomed to ObamaCare. Conservatives have thus suggested policies like litigation reform, prescription-drug savings, premium support in Medicare, and Medicaid savings through block grants with slower growth rates and state flexibility.</td>

      <td>His research was rigorous, and he was one of the few economists who know how to engage with the public.</td>
      <td>America has lost one of its greatest economists and public intellectuals. Walter Williams died Wednesday morning after teaching his final class at George Mason University on Tuesday. He was 84.<br />For 40 years Walter was the heart and soul of George Mason’s unique Department of Economics. Our department unapologetically resists the trend of teaching economics as if it’s a guide for social engineers. This resistance reflects Walter’s commitment to liberal individualism and his belief that ordinary men and women deserve, as his friend Thomas Sowell puts it, “elbow room for themselves and a refuge from the rampaging presumptions of their ‘betters.’ ”<br />A onetime cabdriver who grew up poor in Philadelphia, Walter knew injustice—and understood the way to fight it wasn’t by emoting but by probing and learning. In 1972 he earned a doctorate in economics from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he learned to look beneath surface phenomena for deeper causes and consequences.<br />His pioneering 1982 book, “The State Against Blacks,” is an eloquent, data-rich broadside against occupational licensing, taxicab regulations, labor-union privileges and other fine-sounding government measures that inflict disproportionate harm on blacks by restricting the employment options and by driving up the costs of goods and services.<br />The economics profession boasts many excellent minds, but it has precious few with the ability and interest to do rigorous research and to engage the public with its results. Milton Friedman was such a scholar, as is Thomas Sowell. Walter was in their league. From his appearance on Friedman’s PBS program “Free To Choose” (1980) through his stints as guest host of Rush Limbaugh’s radio program to his syndicated column, Walter brought economic lessons to life in a way few others could.</td>

The Fed and Treasury had established those programs with some of the $454 billion Congress had made available in the law.<br />“This was not a political decision. I was merely implementing the Cares Act,” Mr. Mnuchin said, echoing comments he made on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee.<br />Mr. Mnuchin also said that the programs weren’t needed anymore and that the money he hadn’t approved for the programs, as well as other funds that wouldn’t be needed, would be better used on another pandemic relief bill.<br />Mr. Mnuchin said he had explained his reasoning and underscored that his decision wasn’t politically motivated in a recent phone call with Janet Yellen, who is President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to serve as the next Treasury secretary. He said she didn’t express an opinion during the call.</td>

Without a test, a person should self-quarantine for 10 days, and monitor themselves an additional four days for symptoms, the agency said. A 14-day quarantine period is still “the best way to reduce risk,” said Henry Walke, incident manager for the CDC’s Covid-19 response. The agency considers the shorter periods to be alternatives.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 24 that the CDC was completing recommendations for a new quarantine period of this length, after reviewing studies and its own modeling suggesting that shorter quarantines were possible.<br />The CDC officials encouraged people to stay home and not travel for the coming holidays.</td>

It will feature content from channels including TLC, Food Network, Discovery Channel and Animal Planet. The service will also include library programming licensed from other companies, including the BBC, A&E Networks and Group Nine Media.<br />Discovery has struck an agreement with  Verizon Communications Inc.  to provide the streaming service free to the wireless company’s U.S. customers for a year, with Verizon and Discovery sharing the cost of those subscriptions, according to people familiar with the deal.<br />Discovery is launching a streaming service months after some of its biggest competitors.

Viewers by the millions are abandoning traditional pay TV for streaming services, imperiling the lucrative licensing fees that cable and satellite companies pay to cable network owners. Almost all major TV programmers, including  Comcast Corp.’s  NBCUniversal,  ViacomCBS Inc.  and WarnerMedia, have launched their own streaming services in an effort to reach those viewers.</td>

      <td>On a video call before Thanksgiving, Mariah Carey looks like she’s on a Christmas card come to life. The singer with 19 No. 1 songs to her name is wearing a dress with the sparkle of snow crystals, and her hair flows over her shoulders in frosty waves. She’s surrounded by gift wrapped packages, fuzzy pillows and white trees glowing with lights.<br />“I’m sitting here with eight trees in my house,” she says of the setting for the interview. “It’s completely over the top.”<br />It’s an apt description for Ms. Carey’s commitment to Christmas—and the bountiful seasonal business that has become a pillar of her career. Her 26-year-old song “All I Want for Christmas Is You” is the engine of one of the biggest holiday hit machines of all time. The song, off a 1994 Christmas album that initially seemed like a risky detour, only simmered for years as a staple of Christmas radio. But in the digital era it has undergone a miraculous ascent, thanks to its age-defying bop, the power of holiday playlists, the multiplying effects of the streaming ecosystem, and her fans’ ritual dedication to the song. She has built a franchise around the propulsive tune in recent years with alternate versions and videos, and a book and animated movie for kids.<br />This year’s big Christmas play: a TV special for Apple, an accompanying soundtrack album, and a new take on a later yuletide composition of Ms. Carey’s, “Oh Santa!” This version features Ariana Grande and Jennifer Hudson, and a girl-group production style that Ms. Carey conceived as “a Supremes moment.”<br />“All I Want for Christmas Is You” snowballed to 309 million on-demand audio and video streams last year, according to Nielsen Music/MRC Data. That helped push it to No. 1 on Billboard’s all-genre Hot 100 songs chart for the first time. It got streamed more than chestnuts like Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” and other latter-day standards like Wham!’s “Last Christmas.” As of Thanksgiving this year, her song had reappeared among the more fleeting hits on the chart (most recently at No. 14), where it’s almost guaranteed to climb as Christmas approaches.</td>

Twelve years ago, as Barack Obama’s newly elected vice president, Mr. Biden inherited an economy laid low by a once-in-a-century crisis.<br />The good news is that, unlike then, the recovery from the pandemic-driven economic contraction is now under way and with vaccines about to be approved, an end to the latest crisis is in sight. The bad news for Mr. Biden is that while he and his team want to accelerate the recovery, they may not be able to do much about it. Monetary policy is largely exhausted and fiscal policy is at the mercy of Congress.<br />In 2009, Democrats controlled both the House and Senate. If Republicans win at least one of two runoffs in Georgia next month, they will retain control of the Senate, where they will likely take a harder line on deficits than they did under President Trump.<br />The emphasis Mr. Biden has placed on the recovery can be seen from who he has asked to steer it. If confirmed, Janet Yellen would be the first practicing economist to serve as Treasury secretary in two decades. She has spent her career in academia and government, including as head of the Federal Reserve, studying and managing the balance between unemployment and inflation.<br />Today, it is clear which is the priority. Like the financial crisis 12 years ago, “The pandemic and economic fallout…have caused so much damage for so many,” she said Tuesday. “It’s essential that we move with urgency. Inaction will produce a self-reinforcing downturn causing yet more devastation.”</td>

      <td>Coalition partners pull their support for the government, potentially leading to another election</td>
      <td>TEL AVIV—Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition partners withdrew their support for the government, raising the possibility that it could collapse and send the country to a fourth election in less than two years.<br />A preliminary reading of a bill introduced by the opposition to dissolve parliament passed 61-54 on Wednesday, with Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition partners, the centrist Blue and White party, voting in favor of it. It will need to pass three more votes to become law, a process that will likely stretch into next week or longer. The parties could still reach a compromise that could avert the government’s collapse.<br />The dissolution of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, would trigger a fresh election, likely in March.<br />The prospect of that underscores the continuous pressure Mr. Netanyahu faces amid what may be his toughest political challenges to date: managing the coronavirus pandemic, along with its economic fallout, while standing trial for corruption.<br />After three elections in the space of one year, Mr. Netanyahu failed to cobble together enough support and in May joined a unity government with Blue and White leader Benny Gantz. Ahead of Wednesday’s vote, Mr. Gantz said his party would support the measure introduced by Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid, who split from Mr. Gantz’s party when the latter joined Mr. Netanyahu’s government.</td>

      <td>A top Federal Reserve official said the central bank will need to decide on how to communicate its intentions to continue buying government assets but that broader changes to its policy stance, including by altering those purchases right now, weren’t needed.<br />In an interview Tuesday, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said after getting through what he expected would be a difficult three-to-six month period for the economy due to the resurgence of coronavirus cases, officials need to “start thinking about how we want to begin to taper or communicate the composition and the size of our asset purchases.”<br />The Fed bought hundreds of billions of dollars of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities between March and June to stabilize dysfunctional markets, and it has continued buying $120 billion a month in those assets to maintain smooth functioning and hold down long-term interest rates to support the economy.<br />Fed officials at their meeting last month said they expected those purchases to continue over the coming months, and minutes of the meeting released last week showed they discussed providing more information as soon as their next meeting, Dec. 15-16, around how long they would keep buying those securities by linking the time frame for the stimulus program to economic conditions.<br />“We’re going to have to give some clarification, I think, in the not too distant future,” Mr. Kaplan said. “I could see where at some point we might give guidance on expressing the conditions under which we begin to taper, for example.”</td>

      <td>Denny Rodman, an antiques collector in Houston, made an exciting find on Facebook’s online marketplace in August. An old image of three men looked a lot like the infamous Dalton brothers, the Wild West bank robbers.<br />He bought the photo for $100, wrote a 35-page report arguing for its authenticity, then sent the report to Bob Utley, a 91-year-old authority on the outlaws of the period. He included a facial-recognition analysis that showed strong evidence of a match.<br />Mr. Utley wasn’t convinced. “Identifying people of generations ago by face recognition is almost always a non-starter,” he wrote back. “It’s a very long shot that these portraits are of the Daltons.”<br />Facial-recognition technology, commonly used to unlock phones, open doors and even surveil the unsuspecting public, is roiling the world of antique photograph collecting. Hobbyists have turned to facial-recognition software to try to match faces in found photos to those of famous historical figures.<br />Antiquities brokers, auctioneers and historians, however, say such methods aren’t dependable, and that the technology has loosed a flood of bogus claims about the identifies of people in ordinary old photos. Hobbyists interested in the 19th century American West have surfaced with claims about newly found photos of the bad guys like Billy the Kid and Jesse James and famed lawmen such as Wyatt Earp and Pat Garrett.</td>

      <td>AT THE START of the coronavirus pandemic last spring, many New Yorkers fled to weekend houses as fast as the bridges and tunnels could funnel them out of town. Other, less affluent city dwellers eventually followed, looking to secure a pop-up rental or spot on a parent’s couch.<br />Now a lot of the runaways have returned, but with New York in another partial lockdown, they and their families are aching for the pre-pandemic Gotham they left behind.<br />To reclaim New York City this season and view the metropolis all lit-up like a Christmas tree, gather the relatives and get moving on up to a deluxe compartment in the sky: One of Manhattan’s four loftiest observatories, a vantage point from which the city’s persona never changes. Next fall, a fifth viewing platform—confidently called the Summit—opens on East 42nd Street on the 59th floor of the One Vanderbilt building.<br />Unsurprisingly, the city’s observatories are far less crowded these days. As required by New York state law, they have cut capacity by 75% and have high-tech air-purification systems in place. Elevators are all touchless. Masks and reservations are mandatory.<br />Even Horace Greeley, the storied American newspaper editor, might amend his famous dictate to “Don’t go West.” And forget about Westchester or Long Island. Go straight up.</td>

But as with much of his agenda, the fate of his plans rests on which party has control of the Senate following Georgia’s runoff elections in January.<br />Mr. Biden’s boldest proposals include lowering the age for Medicare enrollment to 60 from 65 and instituting a public-option health plan.<br />Tackling the surge of coronavirus cases will pose the most immediate challenge. Mr. Biden is focusing on the pandemic ahead of his inauguration with his own coronavirus advisory group. He has already used his role as president-elect to urge the public to wear masks and social distance, and his transition team has begun working with the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services.<br />They have also been in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-diseases expert. Mr. Biden has yet to name a new Health and Human Services secretary.<br />Kate Bedingfield, a senior Biden transition adviser, said last week that the transition agency review teams had reached out to the White House and each relevant federal agency to request briefings on “all matters related to the Covid-19 response.” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said last week that Mr. Biden’s team had been briefed on Covid response by Rear Admiral Erica Schwartz, the deputy surgeon general.</td>

      <td>CVS Health Corp.  and  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  are preparing to bring Covid-19 shots to long-term care facilities, but the effort will need to navigate rollout details that may vary by state, vaccines that require more than one dose and potential reluctance by staffers to get the novel shots.<br />An advisory panel to the U.S. government recommended on Tuesday that residents of long-term care facilities be included with doctors, nurses and health-care workers to be first in line for vaccines. States, which will ultimately decide how to allocate Covid-19 vaccine supplies, don’t need to follow the guidelines, though they usually do. But logistics and other aspects of the effort may differ among states, even among those that broadly accept the panel’s conclusions.<br />Vaccines are on track for federal authorization this month and could begin shipping within days of receiving clearance, U.S. officials have said. CVS and Walgreens will deliver most vaccine doses for the nation’s approximately 15,600 nursing homes and 29,000 assisted-living communities.<br />Hospitals and other medical clinics are slated to serve as vaccination sites for health-care workers in the initial rollout, but pharmacy workers are expected to come to nursing homes and other adult-care facilities to deliver and administer the vaccines to residents and, likely, staff.<br />The long-term care rollout will be an early test of how quickly and efficiently CVS, Walgreens and governments can distribute Covid-19 vaccines, a campaign expected to last months. They are working to address storage and transportation issues for vaccines that need to be kept at colder temperatures than vaccines for other diseases, as well as concerns that some residents and staffers may decline the shots.</td>

The symptoms were harsh enough to land him in hospital for two weeks. “Back then we knew very little about the virus,” he wrote in an email.<br />By the time Gaviria was healthy enough to leave Abu Dhabi, his world was a more uncertain place. The sports calendar had been scrubbed. Entire countries were shutting down. But Gaviria’s virus ordeal seemed to come with a personal silver lining. Prevailing wisdom suggested he’d at least be immune for the foreseeable future.<br />That future lasted barely seven months. In October, Gaviria tested positive a second time. His reaction was sheer disbelief.<br />“I was completely asymptomatic and felt OK,” he wrote.</td>

The episodes run 45 minutes to an hour, usually four days a week, and unpack such things as the plot, scenery, actors and Christmas ornaments. Regular segments include “All the Feels”—about what, if anything, emotionally overwhelmed the reviewers. They also regularly host stars of the films, such as Andrew Walker, who is more than happy to provide his own candid thoughts on Hallmark movies—including his own.
