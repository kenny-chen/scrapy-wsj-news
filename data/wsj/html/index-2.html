      <td>Home security company proposes a bankruptcy reorganization that would be tough on junior creditors</td>
      <td>Private-equity-owned Secure Home Holdings LLC filed for bankruptcy protection after its top-ranking lenders agreed to award themselves the home-security systems business, leaving unsecured creditors owed $110 million unpaid.<br />Chief Executive Amy Kothari said the company is current on its trade debt, payments to landlords and other critical suppliers, and expects the bankruptcy will have no material impact on vendors.<br />The terms are proposed in a “prepackaged” chapter 11 reorganization plan that Secure Home filed Monday, shortly after the Sunday bankruptcy filing. Ballots haven't been cast yet, but top lenders, led by affiliates of  Invesco Ltd. , have agreed to cancel part of their debt in exchange for ownership of Secure Home.<br />Bank lenders are owed, in the aggregate, about $197 million, a figure that includes unspecified fees and costs, according to court papers.<br />Funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management mostly own Secure Home, with Ironwood Capital and Alcentra Capital Corp. as minority stakeholders. Oaktree declined to comment. Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP and Chipman Brown Cicero & Cole LLP are providing legal advice to Secure Home. M3 Advisory Partners LP is the financial adviser. The case, No. 21-10745, has been assigned to Judge Kate Stickles</td>

      <td>Practice of funding home-state projects was shunned for a decade</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Senate will once again accept earmarks on a bipartisan basis for spending bills for the next fiscal year, with added measures to boost transparency and accountability, said the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.).<br />Earmarking allows lawmakers to direct federal agencies to spend specific amounts on projects in their home states or districts.<br />Under Mr. Leahy’s guidelines, senators’ earmarks—Mr. Leahy prefers the term “congressionally directed spending items”—will be subject to pre-existing rules that require senators to make any requests in writing and certify that they and their families don’t hold financial stakes in any of the projects for which they are seeking funding.<br />There are new restrictions as well. The money for earmarks will be capped at 1% of discretionary spending; funds are barred from going to for-profit entities; and senators are required to post their earmark requests online, along with their paperwork attesting that they and their relatives won’t benefit financially.<br />The change had been anticipated. House Democrats said earlier this year that they would revive earmarks, with new rules in place, and the House GOP voted last month in a secret ballot to allow them, as well. The Senate GOP dropped plans for a vote on earmarking behind closed doors last week, leaving their conference rule against them in place. But some Republican senators—including the top-ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee, Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama—have said they don’t consider the rule binding and plan to request earmarks anyway.</td>

      <td>Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has some good ideas, but Congress is the biggest obstacle to more significant reform.</td>
      <td>Democrats are again calling for Louis DeJoy’s head, so give the man some credit for sticking his neck out. If you’ve heard of Mr. DeJoy, the nation’s 75th Postmaster General, it’s probably because Democrats alleged last year that he was sabotaging the U.S. Postal Service to aid President Trump.<br />As soon as Mr. Trump lost the election, that false narrative vanished into the mists. Yet it’s not hard to see why Mr. DeJoy, new to the public eye, might prefer to lie low. Instead he’s out selling a 10-year plan to turn around the USPS, while taking incoming tomatoes all over again.<br />“We had no choice. We had to get moving. We lost $10 billion last year,” he says. “Our service standards were eroding and would continue to erode as mail volume came down.” Ron Bloom, chairman of the USPS’s board, agrees. “Over my career, I’ve been involved with a lot of companies who’ve died slowly,” he says. “And, bluntly, that’s what the Postal Service was doing.”<br />It’s the same killer that got  Blockbuster : the internet. Since 2006 total mail volume is down 39%. There’s less mail than in 1984. Yet the number of delivery points rises by more than a million a year. Put differently, the USPS says in 2006 there were 5.6 daily pieces of mail per delivery point. Last year: three. By 2030 the estimate is 1.7. The USPS is meant to be self-sufficient, but its losses since 2007 run to $87 billion, with $160 billion more projected this decade.<br />The question for the USPS is on what terms this will come to a stop. For now Congress has mandated six-day delivery. Universal service is also sacrosanct, so the USPS still runs mules to a village at the base of the Grand Canyon. Trying to make the Postal Service solvent, while coloring inside the lines drawn by Congress, is no easy feat.</td>

      <td>Mayor Ted Wheeler has an epiphany about riots and destruction.</td>
      <td>A well-known politician on Friday denounced “self-described anarchists who engage in regular criminal destruction” and want to “burn,” “bash” and “intimidate.” He called for “higher bail” and “tougher pretrial restrictions” on rioters. And he pleaded with the public to cooperate with police and identify miscreants: “Our job is to unmask them, arrest them, and prosecute them.”<br />Donald Trump? Sheriff Arpaio? Nope.<br />That was Portland, Ore., Mayor Ted Wheeler, the über-progressive, who made a national reputation last year by apologizing for vandals and rioters he said were merely exercising their right to protest against an unjust America. Now he’s had an epiphany, after his indulgence has made parts of Portland a battle zone.<br />Activists on the right and left have clashed in Portland’s streets, often violently, with few consequences since Mr. Wheeler was elected mayor in 2016. Rioting escalated after George Floyd’s death. But even as agitators shot fireworks at law enforcement, firebombed government buildings and set fire to cop cars and a police union hall, Mr. Wheeler directed police not to use CS gas for crowd control.<br />When the Trump Administration sent agents to defend federal property, Mr. Wheeler called it “an attack on our democracy” and blamed the feds for “increased violence and vandalism in our downtown core.” The fiscal 2021 budget slashed police funding by some $27 million.</td>

      <td>The Biden Administration is no fan of fossil fuels. But even it disagrees with New Jersey’s slick argument in a case the Supreme Court will hear Wednesday that the Constitution gives states a veto over interstate gas pipelines that trumps federal regulatory and judicial review.<br />At issue in PennEast Pipeline Co. v. New Jersey is a 116-mile pipeline between Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the pipeline after a two-year review that involved more than 200 meetings with public officials. Some 70 variations were made to the route during the review.<br />New Jersey sought to block the pipeline by invoking its sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to block the condemnation of 42 state parcels of land needed to build the pipeline.<br />Once FERC certifies a pipeline, the Natural Gas Act delegates the federal government’s eminent domain power to the pipeline company. Other federal laws delegate federal eminent domain power to private parties to build railroads and transmission lines, though many explicitly carve out state property. The Natural Gas Act has no such carve-out.<br />Yet New Jersey argues in the case now before the High Court that the Eleventh Amendment prohibits states from being sued by private parties in federal court. Ergo, PennEast Pipeline can’t use FERC’s eminent domain delegation to condemn state sovereign property in federal court.</td>

      <td>The opposition of market capitalism to state-oriented socialism and communism was the basic conflict in 20th-century political economy. But like many an economic and political theory, this durable model for delineating the possibilities—free markets vs. a “command economy”—cannot survive today’s Chinese state.<br />Capitalism and communism, opposed in ideology, turn out to be compatible in the real world. And perhaps the conceptual opposition is also collapsing in the West, as capitalism goes woke and sneaker commercials become indistinguishable from AOC campaign materials except by their production values.<br />“Leftism” as we know it crystallized in the 19th century largely under the aegis of Marxism, which described capitalism as an exploitative and murderous ideology that lionized greed. Leftists’ solution, as expressed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels’s “The Communist Manifesto,” was government control of the economy under the “dictatorship of the proletariat.”<br />But the dictators turned out to be people rather than an abstract historical force, so it wasn’t a solution to human greed after all. Turning over all manufacturing and agriculture and trade to the party simply meant concentrating all the wealth and power in a few hands. It made the Soviet government, for example, a new oligarchy.<br />The Soviet oligarchy was little more effective than the czarist aristocracy it replaced. It didn’t learn enough, or quickly enough, from its capitalist rivals. It was terrible at marketing itself. Many Western analysts concluded that a command economy was unworkable, that the distance between government bureaucracy and real transactions made the economy unresponsive to changing conditions, unable to take advantage of opportunities, and unable to supply its population with what it actually needed.</td>

      <td>My legislation would protect free expression by treating Big Tech companies as common carriers.</td>
      <td>For too long Americans have watched Big Tech trample on the principles of the First Amendment—free speech, freedom of thought and belief, free assembly and the open exchange of ideas. As more information is filtered through online platforms, the First Amendment is becoming a dead letter. That’s why I’m taking action to hold these corporations accountable.<br />Today, I’m introducing the 21st Century Foundation for the Right to Express and Engage in Speech Act (or the 21st Century FREE Speech Act), which would restore the Bill of Rights—rather than the whims of big companies—as the guide for what Americans can say or hear in today’s public square.<br />The modern public square is dominated by ubiquitous platforms facing little meaningful competition. Instead of being accountable to consumers or voters, the companies that dominate communication today use opaque, inconsistent practices to control the information Americans get to see and discuss. As Justice Clarence Thomas noted in a recent Supreme Court opinion, common carriers—such as trains or phone networks, which are essential to everyday goings-on, connecting people and information—have historically been subject “to special regulations, including a general requirement to serve all comers” without discrimination. The same logic should apply today to Big Tech.<br />Unfortunately, our laws haven't kept pace with this technological reality. The statutes governing free speech and the free exchange of ideas online haven't been updated in a quarter-century. Since it was passed in 1996, Section 230 has been stretched from its original intent—the promotion of the free exchange of ideas online—into a license for companies like  Facebook  and  Twitter  to censor.<br />In recent months, these platforms have effectively smothered newspaper stories that they found inconvenient for their loudest users’ preferred candidates. Big Tech companies have silenced mainstream American political figures, while leaving up Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s account, even as he tweets hateful things, including calls to “eliminate Israel” and discussions of how to do so. These platforms have censored and editorialized with blatant political bias—writing progressive ideology into their content policies or scrubbing dissent against Covid lockdowns off their sites. Moderate and conservative viral content is suppressed. Twitter blocked the account of the New York Post over its reporting on Hunter Biden, while  Amazon  removed from its streaming service an acclaimed documentary on Justice Thomas during Black History Month. Implicit in these censorship practices is an apparent belief that Big Tech has the right to shape what Americans can learn and believe—a totalitarian concept that runs contrary to U.S. values.</td>

      <td>Marcus Aurelius was conﬁdent that goodness can be attained—that we can choose virtue, and avoid vice, with every decision we make.</td>
      <td>Consider the fortunes of Marcus Aurelius, ruler of Rome from A.D. 161 to 180 and follower of the Stoic ethical creed. He never meant to be a published author; the thoughts he set down, in Greek, were part of a purely personal self-improvement project. Someone, somehow, preserved the notebooks containing his loose assemblage of spiritual jottings. One day in the 17th century a clever translator, Méric Casaubon, gave the collection the title “Meditations,” and a bestseller was born.<br />Though it lacks structure and deploys, at times, arcane terms and concepts, “Meditations” has struck a chord with modern readers as few Greek or Roman texts have done, elevating its author to stardom—literally, given Richard Harris’s portrayal of a sober, sagacious Marcus in the hit 2000 film “Gladiator.”<br />Undoubtedly the work’s diaristic origins are a part of its appeal. Because Marcus is essentially talking to himself, his voice has remarkable authenticity. His readers can trust him for the simple reason that he’s unaware of their presence. Not even Augustine’s “Confessions,” notionally a conversation between the author and God, or Seneca’s “Moral Epistles,” an apparently private correspondence to which we are given access, can quite match the earnestness and integrity of a text that was never meant to be read at all.<br />Marcus’ life and times also contribute to the spell cast by “Meditations.” Thinkers since Plato have longed for a philosopher-king, a ruler able to wield great power while maintaining a strong moral core; Marcus seems to approximate that ideal. He came to the emperorship by adoption, the method employed by the Antonine emperors to anoint promising successors. His reign of nearly two decades was a success, the last phase of what Edward Gibbon dubbed the “most happy and prosperous” era of all human history. Marcus, however, ended that era when he broke with Antonine tradition and passed on rule to his natural son, Commodus, a cruel and selfish man (and, as modern moviegoers know, an amateur gladiator).<br />The degree to which “Meditations” has seized the modern imagination can be judged by the ever-increasing pace of new English-language versions. Amid this glut, the new edition by Robin Waterfield, a British classics scholar, has much to recommend it. The prose is wonderfully sober and taut, the choices felicitous. (“Command center,” Mr. Waterfield’s rendering of Marcus’ term for the rational, guiding mind, is an unfortunate exception.) The volume’s stand-out feature is its wide-ranging set of footnotes, offering assistance to novice readers, insights that will intrigue specialists, and reformulations that clarify Marcus’ thoughts. Thus the difficult “Meditations” entry, “Anything that doesn’t make a person worse in himself doesn’t make his life worse either, and does him no harm,” gets aptly reframed in Mr. Waterfield’s note as: “The only truly bad thing is moral vice; nothing else is truly harmful.”</td>

      <td>Where do rights fit into international solutions with nations like China or Russia?</td>
      <td>Ever since James Monroe instructed the European powers to keep their colonization efforts out of the Western Hemisphere, historians have looked for “doctrines,” the big ideas that guide presidents in their conduct of foreign policy. After last week’s virtual climate conference, political observers can begin to see the Biden doctrine will both clarify and complicate the tasks of U.S. foreign policy.<br />Simply put, the Biden doctrine holds that geopolitical competition must not be allowed to drive world history. Competition with China is real and must be vigorously pursued, but the essential goal of American foreign policy is to construct a values-based world order that can tackle humanity’s common problems in an organized and even collegial way.<br />This, Bidenites argue, is hardheaded realism. During the Cold War, self-interest—not starry-eyed idealism—kept American presidents and Soviet leaders from pushing the nuclear button, just as it was self-interest that led both sides to seek to limit their nuclear rivalry through arms control.<br />In the 21st century, problems like climate change, pandemics, financial regulation and cybersecurity simply cannot be solved by national governments acting alone. That reality, the new administration believes, forces world leaders to work together whether they like it or not. Global problems are so important, and the consequences of failing to address them so immediate, that countries have no choice but to cooperate. That cooperation reduces the scope and changes the nature of geopolitical competition. Just as the threat of nuclear destruction kept the Cold War cold, so threats like climate change and pandemics will limit international rivalries today.<br />Under these circumstances, Washington’s best response to geopolitical challenges from countries like China and Russia, Bidenites believe, is to change the subject. The U.S. can’t ignore the military and strategic facts of life, but order-building, not coup-counting, should be the goal. Even as America fends off Chinese and Russian efforts to undermine its global strategic position, Washington should constantly push the theme of common efforts to solve common problems.</td>

      <td>Unlike Hollywood’s woke, at least its Communists could make good movies.</td>
      <td>For years conservatives have bemoaned Hollywood’s influence on American norms and mores. Sunday night ought to allay any such fears. Far from showcasing its mighty influence on American life, the 93rd Academy Awards confirmed that our movie industry no longer even knows how to entertain.<br />Start with the inexplicable decision to dispense with clips from nominated films in favor of more time for presenters and winners to drone on about whatever they had on their minds. From actress-director Regina King’s opening remarks about the Derek Chauvin verdict in Minneapolis to the later reference to police killings and the themes represented by the films nominated for best picture (#MeToo feminism, 1960s black militancy, the plight of an Amazon worker, etc.), it had all the glamour and appeal of a public-television fundraiser. It’s not that this year’s Oscars were too political. It’s that they were too boring.<br />Bill Maher called it. Two weeks before the Oscars aired, the HBO host of “Real Time with Bill Maher” said that after a year of Covid-19, he had hoped for a little Hollywood escapism. But “judging by this year’s best-picture nominees,” he said, “you couldn’t have a worse time at the movies if there was an active shooter in the theater.”<br />Here’s his summary of the contenders, starting with “Nomadland,” which took home the award for best picture:<br />“That’s the one about the woman who winds up living in her van after her husband dies of cancer. In ‘Judas and the Black Messiah,’ the FBI kills the leader of the Black Panthers, and in ‘The Trial of the Chicago 7’ the FBI kills the leader of the Black Panthers again. ‘Promising Young Woman’ has Carey Mulligan avenging a murderous rapist, but then he kills her too. . . . ‘The Sound Of Metal’ is about a musician going deaf. ‘The Father’ is about an octogenarian descending into dementia. And ‘Minari’ is the story of dirt-poor Korean immigrants in Arkansas who put all their food in a barn, but then grandma has a stroke and burns it down. Now enjoy the show!”</td>

      <td>An archaic regulatory process that depends on placebo trials is blocking access to new drugs.</td>
      <td>It’s hard to process what the doctor is saying: You have a disease that will rapidly paralyze you until it eventually suffocates you to death. But you are one of the lucky ones: You qualify for a clinical trial of a promising experimental drug. There is a 30% to 50% chance of receiving a placebo instead of the experimental therapy. A placebo is necessary, you learn, because each person with your disease is so different, and there are no objective measures to predict the course of your disease. Still, you are grateful to qualify for the trial; most patients don’t.<br />Fortunately, the trial has a design that is friendly to patients, and so six months later, after the randomized portion is complete, all patients may receive the real drug as part of what’s called an “open label extension.” Without this, you may only get the placebo. And the access to the real drug may end once the trial is complete, even if it was helping you.<br />My husband, Mike Cimbura, was one of the 36 participants who received the drug NurOwn in a Phase 2 clinical trial for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Mike regained some function, but he was able to get only one dose before the trial ended. Mike and I fought for continued access to treatment and to improve an archaic regulatory pathway. He died waiting for change in 2019.<br />Promising therapies are on the horizon for ALS, but most people with the disease won’t live to see them. Most patients die within two to five years of diagnosis. These patients need more access to promising therapies and a more flexible regulatory process that would accommodate the moderate advances needed to get closer to a cure.<br />In September 2019, the Food and Drug Administration put out new guidance on developing drugs for ALS, thought to be a step toward modernizing development. The agency says that during development “sponsors should collect safety data, including data from open-label studies or expanded access programs, from patients across the spectrum of disease stages and severities.” The agency reiterated its support for regulatory flexibility when applying standards to drugs for diseases with serious unmet medical needs.</td>

      <td>The Justices might finally stop lower-court judges from hollowing out the landmark Heller ruling.</td>
      <td>The Supreme Court has been gun-shy for more than a decade, so its decision on Monday to take a firearms case from New York is welcome news. The Justices have a chance to correct the lower-court judges who are trying to make the Second Amendment an empty right that ends at the gun owner’s front door.<br />New York bans openly carrying a handgun. Concealed carrying is allowed with a license, but to get one the general public must show “proper cause.” That means some “special need for self-protection,” and living or working in a high-crime area doesn’t count. “The state makes it virtually impossible for the ordinary law-abiding citizen to obtain a license,” say the petitioners in New York State Rifle and Pistol Assn. v. Corlett.<br />This is difficult to square with the Second Amendment, which protects “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms.” But the Supreme Court’s absenteeism on gun rights has left other judges in charge. Justice Antonin Scalia’s 2008 landmark opinion in D.C. v. Hellerrecognized an individual right to own guns in common use, specifically but not solely at home. McDonald v. Chicago in 2010 made that enforceable on the states. Since then? Crickets.<br />The result has been a circuit-court chasm, as liberal judges hollow out the Second Amendment. Last month the Ninth Circuit said: “There is no right to carry arms openly in public; nor is any such right within the scope of the Second Amendment.” That supplements the Ninth Circuit’s ruling five years ago: “There is no Second Amendment right for members of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public.” No open carry; no concealed carry: This is the enfeebled status of an enumerated right in a judicial circuit that covers nine states and 67 million Americans.<br />Why the Supreme Court has let such shenanigans continue for so long is unknown. Our informed view is that the conservative wing has feared that former Justice Anthony Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts might prove unreliable on the question. Some impatience has seeped out in dissents to denials of hearing petitions. “As evidenced by our continued inaction in this area,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in 2018, “the Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this Court.”</td>

She became a member of Danity Kane, the quintet that emerged from the show, and the girl group put out two chart-topping LPs in the late 2000s. And Ms. Richard was prominently featured on another project helmed by Mr. Combs, the 2010 album “Last Train to Paris,” which hit the top 10 and garnered critical notice for its lustrous mix of rap, R&B and pulsing European club music. After making an impact on television and the charts and having worked closely with a famous pop mogul, Ms. Richard seemed positioned for a career on a major label. But she took a different path.</td>

      <td>A 16-CD boxed set celebrates a 20th-century Polish conductor who reinvigorated the music of composers from Brahms to Gershwin and was, for a time, the premier orchestra builder in the U.S.</td>
      <td><br />If the name Artur Rodzinski means little to music lovers today, that’s because time and more media-savvy maestros have eclipsed his fame. But from the 1930s till his death in 1958, this Polish conductor had the respect not just of audiences, but also of musicians, including his peers on the podium. Now one of his great contributions to American musical life—his directorship of the New York Philharmonic in the mid-1940s—is being celebrated thanks to a new compilation of recordings. Titled “Artur Rodzinski—New York Philharmonic: The Complete Columbia Album Collection,” the box of 16 CDs from Sony Classical also contains material from several years later with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, but not, alas, Rodzinski’s earlier Columbia recordings with the Cleveland Orchestra nor his later records with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on RCA.<br />Rodzinski (pronounced roh-JIN-skee), the son of an army medical officer, was born in 1892 in the Dalmatian city of Split, then part of the Habsburg Empire. His studies eventually took him to Vienna, where he trained under such musical luminaries as the composer Franz Schreker, the conductor Franz Schalk and the pianist Emil von Sauer. Leopold Stokowski spotted his talent and appointed him his assistant at the Philadelphia Orchestra, where the younger conductor’s fame quickly grew. Posts in Los Angeles and Cleveland soon cemented his standing as this country’s pre-eminent orchestra builder, with him laying the groundwork on which others erected, or at least burnished, their reputations.<br />A peak in this regard came in 1937, when Arturo Toscanini chose him to select and train the members of the radio orchestra that NBC was creating in New York for the venerable Italian maestro. So when the New York Philharmonic (then styled as the Philharmonic-Symphony Society of New York) needed a new chief conductor, Rodzinski seemed an obvious choice. A longstanding commitment to opera in concert and new music, along with his mastery of wide swaths of the canon, left little, if anything, beyond his reach.<br />Yet great talent sometimes breeds great conflict—or so it was with Rodzinski’s perfectionist tendencies and artistic ambitions. He was the first to carry the title of music director at the Philharmonic and summarily dismissed 14 players. (He was also, almost certainly, the last to carry a loaded pistol to performances!) But he was unskilled at playing musical politics, and his abbreviated tenure, from 1943 to 1947, was the subject of a harsh Time magazine cover story.</td>

It will also seek to determine whether officers use excessive force, discriminate based on race and engage in unconstitutional stops, arrests and seizures.<br />“Investigators will seek input from every corner of Louisville,” Mr. Garland said.<br />It is the second such probe the Justice Department has launched in a week, as the agency takes a more active role in overhauling local police agencies.<br />Mr. Garland on Wednesday said the department would examine whether Minneapolis police engage in excessive force and discriminatory practices, a day after a state jury convicted Derek Chauvin in the murder of George Floyd, whose killing, following Ms. Taylor’s, touched off nationwide protests over policing and racial injustice.</td>

They will also lose or gain votes in the Electoral College beginning in 2024. Texas will gain two seats in the House. Five states will gain one each: Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon. Seven states will lose one each: California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The allocation is based on a formula set in a 1941 law.<br />The changes are expected to favor Republicans because red-leaning states are gaining more seats on net, and because the GOP has more control in redrawing the new congressional maps.<br />The U.S. population grew 7.4% in the last decade, according to the Census Bureau. The population reached 331,449,281 last April 1.<br />The electoral shifts reflect the decade’s broad population shifts: slow growth in the Northeast and Midwest and gains in the South and Mountain West. The South grew 10.2%, more than twice the rate of the Northeast or the Midwest. U.S. growth fell from 9.7% in the previous decade and was the slowest since a gain of 7.3% in the 1930s, during the Great Depression.</td>

At the request of Polish authorities, Mr. Zubaydah’s lawyers sought to subpoena information from Drs. Mitchell and Jessen, but the U.S. government intervened, arguing that courts should deny the motion on state-secrets grounds.<br />In 2019, a federal appeals court in San Francisco agreed much of the information the psychologists might possess could be withheld as a state secret, but that there were some matters that already had publicly been disclosed or couldn’t be considered a risk to national security.<br />“Even if Mitchell and Jessen are restricted from disclosing state secrets such as the identities of individuals involved with the detention facility, the nonsecret information in their possession could provide context to Polish prosecutors or corroborate prosecutors’ independent investigations,” Judge Richard Paez wrote for the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.<br />“The details of Abu Zubaydah’s treatment during this period are uncontroverted: he was persistently and repeatedly waterboarded; he spent hundreds of hours in a ‘confinement box,’ described as coffin-sized; he was subjected to various combinations of interrogation techniques including ‘walling, attention grasps, slapping, facial hold, stress positions, cramped confinement, white noise and sleep deprivation’; his food intake was manipulated to minimize the potential of vomiting during waterboarding,” Judge Paez wrote. “To use colloquial terms, as was suggested by the Senate Select Committee Report, Abu Zubaydah was tortured.”</td>

Those talks began earlier this month in Vienna. The episode hasn’t been previously disclosed.<br />U.S. Navy officials confirmed that three fast-attack crafts and one ship known as Harth 55, a 180-foot, twin-hulled support vessel, swarmed the two Coast Guard ships while they were patrolling international waters in the southern portion of the Persian Gulf.<br />The larger vessel repeatedly crossed in front of the bows of the two U.S. vessels, the Monomoy and the Wrangell, coming as close as 70 yards away, officials said. That forced the Wrangell to make defensive maneuvers to avoid a collision, Navy officials said.<br />The American crews issued multiple warnings over a three-hour period as the Iranian ships continued to buzz them. The crew of the Harth 55 responded to the bridge-to-bridge radio queries but the ship continued the unsafe maneuvers, said Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, a spokeswoman for the Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which oversees the region. It was unclear what the Iranian crews communicated by radio.</td>

      <td>We aren’t going back to the 1970s, but the central bank isn’t being realistic about the risk of higher prices.</td>
      <td>Expectations are high that an economic boom is coming. Vaccines are allowing people to get back to normal life. Unprecedented monetary and fiscal policies are designed to stimulate aggregate demand. The Federal Reserve has joined the robust-growth camp, raising its forecast of 2021’s real gross domestic product growth to 6.5%, followed by a strong 3.3% in 2022 and a decline in the unemployment rate to its pre-pandemic low of 3.5% by the end of 2023. That’s below what the Fed considers sustainable full unemployment.<br />If everybody agrees the boom is coming, why does the Fed remain so sanguine that inflation will stay close to its 2% longer-run target? The central bank’s outlook rests on the experience of the decade following the 2007-09 recession, when inflation remained low despite the fiscal stimulus and easy money. But things are different today, raising the risks that the Fed may be caught flat-footed by higher inflation.<br />The Fed has signaled that it will keep interest rates at zero and continue buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. Financial markets love this. They bask in low yields and high profits. But if the Fed is too slow to reverse its emergency monetary responses to the pandemic, it risks adversely jarring financial markets and the economy.<br />The previous decade isn’t the best guide to current conditions. In response to the pandemic Congress has authorized deficit spending amounting to more than 25% of GDP. That makes the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 look like small beer. Generous government transfer payments to individuals have supported incomes and spending, but they’ve also boosted personal savings approximately $2.25 trillion above pre-pandemic levels, more than 10% of GDP. That doesn’t even count the recent $1.9 trillion in stimulus passed in March and primarily distributed in April, or pending infrastructure legislation.<br />After the 2007-09 crisis, the Fed’s zero interest rates and quantitative-easing programs increased bank reserves, but virtually all that base money remained in the banking system as excess reserves. M2 money—deposits sitting in bank accounts waiting to be spent—barely budged, and the Fed’s stimulus was never put to work in the economy. Inflation remained low and never reached the 2% target because the Fed’s policies, particularly the third round of quantitative easing, in 2012, boosted asset values but failed to stimulate aggregate demand. Nominal GDP growth averaged 4%, which resulted in real GDP averaging 2.25% and inflation averaging 1.75%.</td>

Travelers can also enter with a fresh negative molecular test for Covid-19. France and Italy have indicated they too could soon loosen restrictions on foreign travelers.<br />Agreeing on common rules for the whole 27-country European Union is proving difficult, as often happens. Much of Northern Europe is taking a more cautious approach toward dismantling travel barriers.<br />Although decisions on overseas travel restrictions rest with national governments, EU officials are trying to encourage a common approach. For now, the EU’s recommendation is for members to keep out American tourists. “The decision on switching policy on the recommendation has not yet been taken,” said a spokesman for the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm. The decision “will depend on evolution of the epidemiological situation,” though “the facts are making us optimistic.”<br />The EU is working on implementing vaccination certificates that would facilitate travel between its members and third countries, and has begun discussions with the U.S., among others, about using the certificates.</td>

      <td>Grocers will face tougher competition from restaurants this year, but inflation could end up being helpful</td>
      <td>The pandemic-driven victory lap for supermarkets probably ended last quarter, but inflation could end up being their friend in 2021.<br />Grocery chain owner  Albertsons  Cos. reported year-over-year same-store sales growth of 11.8% in the quarter ended Feb. 27, above the 10.6% growth that analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected.<br />Despite the decent results, Albertsons’ share price sank 7% after its earnings call on Monday morning. That may be partly because of the company’s net loss on a charge related to its multiemployer pension plan. While supermarkets’ pension obligations cast a shadow, it is important to note that the last stimulus package included support for underfunded multiemployer pension plans. Albertsons Chief Financial Officer Robert Diamond said during the call that over 90% of its estimated share of underfunding is expected to be eligible for government assistance.<br />Grocers face tougher comparisons starting in the current quarter, which will be compared with the peak pantry-loading period of 2020. So far this year, consumers still seem to be eating a fair amount at home: Products such as meat, seafood, breakfast cereal and high-end wines continued to sell better than the rest of its selections even as sales of pantry-loading favorites such as soup, pasta and pasta sauce are beginning to falter, Albertsons Chief Executive Vivek Sankaran said in the earnings call, adding that demand still outpaces supply in many categories.<br />One key question for the coming year is how inflation will affect these retailers. The latest data showed that U.S. consumer prices rose sharply in March. Food-at-home prices rose 3.3% from a year earlier while prices for food away from home rose 3.7%. Fast-food restaurant prices jumped 6.5%.</td>

It would also add another regional player to an acrimonious tussle over lucrative gas fields in the Eastern Mediterranean, where an alliance of Greece, Israel, Cyprus and Egypt are facing down opposition from Turkey over a proposed pipeline to export gas to Europe. Greece and Turkey barely avoided confrontation last summer as Ankara sought to explore waters near the Greek island of Rhodes.<br />The deal for Delek Drilling LP’s 22% stake in the Tamar gas field is worth $1 billion, with an additional $100 million to be paid if certain terms and goals are met, according to a notification about the agreement sent to the Israeli Stock Exchange on Monday. The companies said in the statement that they aim to finalize the deal by May 31.<br />“This transaction has the potential to be another major development in our ongoing vision for natural gas commercial strategic alignment in the Middle East, whereby natural gas becomes a source of collaboration in the region,” said Yossi Abu, the chief executive of Delek Drilling.<br />A consortium of American and Israeli companies, including Delek, began pumping natural gas from Israel to Egypt in January 2020. Israeli fields also supply neighboring Jordan.</td>

      <td>Called chimeras, these lab-grown creations have been hailed as a major scientific breakthrough. But some ethics experts see reason for worry</td>
      <td>Imagine pigs with human hearts or mice whose brains have a spark of human intelligence. Scientists are cultivating a flock of such experimental creations, called chimeras, by injecting potent human cells into mice, rats, pigs and cows. They hope the new combinations might one day be used to grow human organs for transplants, study human illnesses or to test new drugs.<br />In the latest advance, researchers in the U.S. and China announced earlier this month that they made embryos that combined human and monkey cells for the first time. So far, these human-monkey chimeras (pronounced ky-meer-uhs) are no more than bundles of budding cells in a lab dish, but the implications are far-reaching, ethics experts say. The use of primates so closely related to humans raises concerns about unintended consequences, animal welfare and the moral status of hybrid embryos, even if the scientific value of the work may be quite high.<br />“There were lots of breakthroughs in this experiment,” says bioethicist Nita Farahany of Duke University. “A remarkable step has been taken scientifically that raises urgent issues of public concern. We need to figure out what the right pathway forward is to help guide responsible progress.”<br />Scientists have been creating partly human chimeras for years. Researchers use rats with human tumors to study cancer, for example, and mice with human immune systems to conduct AIDS research. What makes the latest experiment unique is that the scientists injected human stem cells, which can become any kind of tissue, into an embryo of a closely related primate.<br />To make them, researchers from the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., and China’s Kunming University of Science and Technology injected human stem cells—made by reprogramming mature skin or blood cells—into 132 embryos from macaque monkeys. Six days after the monkey embryos had been created at the State Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research in Kunming, researchers injected each one with 25 human stem cells labeled with a fluorescent red protein.</td>

      <td>President seeks to focus on his pressing domestic agenda, but rivals from China to Russia are probing his resolve on a range of issues</td>
      <td>The first 100 days of Joe Biden’s presidency, a milestone he will reach this week, were largely about fighting the coronavirus and stimulating the domestic economy.<br />For the second 100 days, the rest of the world is closing in.<br />China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all are set to test the president, or already are doing so. China is making ominous moves around Taiwan and in the South China Sea. Though it has backed off a bit in recent days, Russia continues to strike a threatening posture toward Ukraine. Iran has increased the level to which it is enriching uranium, putting new importance on talks about reviving a nuclear agreement with the U.S.<br />And as for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un—well, he’s a bit like the Glenn Close character in the movie “Fatal Attraction,” who declares: “I will not be ignored.” He’s already fired off a few test missiles to prove the point.<br />This isn’t necessarily the agenda the president or his team want for the next 100 days. They have further big domestic ambitions, starting with a giant $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, followed by a similarly large plan to improve child care and education, to be paid for by hotly contested tax increases.</td>

Official media, major search engines and internet censors in her home country are making as if it didn’t happen.<br />Ms. Zhao’s win, just the second time a woman has walked away with best director, unleashed a flurry of congratulatory messages on Chinese social-media sites when it was announced Monday morning Beijing time. By midafternoon, nearly all of the posts had been erased.<br />Searches for her name on  Baidu  and  Sogou ,  the country’s dominant search engines, produced numerous links to news of her previous accolades but only scattered links to deleted articles about the Academy Award honor.<br />State broadcaster China Central Television, the official Xinhua News Agency, and Communist Party mouthpiece the People’s Daily stayed silent on the award throughout the day. Two state media reporters told the Journal they had received orders from China’s propaganda ministry not to report on her victory, despite what they described as her status as a Chinese national, because of “previous public opinion.”<br />China’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the removal of social-media posts during a regular news conference on Monday, saying it wasn’t a diplomatic issue.</td>

It added that its various businesses are currently operating normally.<br />The investigation comes after dozens of China’s largest technology companies, including Meituan, earlier this month publicly pledged to comply with antimonopoly laws after Beijing blocked the initial public offering of Ant Group Co. and hit tech giant  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  with a record $2.8 billion fine.<br />Meituan had said in its pledge that it won’t adopt unreasonable restrictions to force merchants into exclusivity measures.</td>

Mr. Gottschling joined the board in 2017 from the top risk job at Austria’s Erste Group Bank AG.<br />David Herro, a partner at Harris Associates with a roughly 8% stake in Credit Suisse, said he would vote against Mr. Gottschling because he was the director in charge of risk.<br />Norges, an arm of Norway’s central bank that runs its sovereign oil fund, owns around 3% of Credit Suisse. It said it would also oppose re-electing the lead independent director Severin Schwan, who is chief executive at Roche Holding AG, and Richard Meddings, a veteran British banker who joined the board last year and is overseeing investigations into Archegos and Greensill.<br />Under Swiss rules, more than half of voting shares must go against a director to block re-election.</td>

      <td>Airlines say summer leisure fares are getting close to 2019 levels, signaling the end of pandemic bargains. Without corporate travel, though, carriers will still make a lot less money per passenger.</td>
      <td>U.S. airlines are preparing for an almost-normal schedule of flights this summer. What investors and travelers alike are eager to know is whether fares will also bounce back.<br />March is starting to look like the inflection point for the industry’s Covid-19 crisis. At the beginning of the month, Congress was busy passing a third round of aid for carriers. By its end, travel demand had staged an unexpected comeback, the latest string of corporate results showed last week.<br />Executives believe the improvement goes beyond the spring break, and that vaccinations will make it permanent.  Southwest Airlines  and  American Airlines  are recalling pilots and flight attendants, and United Airlines is hiring again.<br />Airlines need to tread with care after last summer’s false start, but signs are encouraging: People are once again booking holidays months in advance. Southwest said Thursday that it isn’t far from 20% booked in July—close to pre-pandemic norms at this time of the year. Statements by the top four operators point to summer seat capacity outstripping analyst forecasts, which currently peg it at around 78% of 2019 levels, according to data by Visible Alpha.<br />The bigger question is whether carriers will need to offer steep discounts to goose the recovery, which could delay their return to profitability. So far, official data and trackers by industry analysts show only a very small increase in fares relative to their pandemic trough.</td>

      <td>Demand alone can’t lead to full recovery across industries such as ride-hailing, airlines, rental cars and home sharing. Now, investors need to worry about supply.</td>
      <td>There was an old lady who lived in a shoe. She’ll be cashing in this summer on  Airbnb .<br />The U.S. economy’s recovery from Covid-19 is causing sticker shock for many goods and services, and some companies are facing resistance from consumers.<br />For example, despite the fact that  Uber Technologies  has said it doesn’t have nearly enough drivers to meet growing rider demand, it also believes customers aren’t willing to pay more than the usual fare for a ride. It and other ride-share companies are now scrambling to bait back drivers to their platforms to boost supply and offer more reasonable pricing to riders that could lead back to business as usual.<br />Supply declines in other sectors also could hinder the overall recovery. Last year, rental-car companies unloaded vehicles to cut costs as demand cratered. Now, they are seeing a sudden recovery amid auto shortages. Experts say it could be well into next year before inventory catches up. A Wall Street Journal report described loyal customers complaining about “unacceptable” wait times recently and rates that are frequently multiples of what they were pre-pandemic. Auto dealers are facing similar constraints.  AutoNation  said last week that its inventory is down more than 38% versus a year ago and that the supply and demand imbalance isn’t likely to improve this year.<br />Also consider the home-sharing economy. A Skift analysis published earlier this month showed Airbnb lost hosts throughout the pandemic—particularly those listing just one property. The analysis notes that single property owners represent more than 70% of Airbnb’s total host population. The company is now enticing hosts by showing them just how much they can bank this summer, even on a yurt, a tiny house or a barn. Airbnb Chief Executive Brian Chesky said earlier this month in a CNBC interview that his company is seeing increased strength of its host community, but also that it probably will have a “high class problem” with more guests than his platform has hosts for. High class problems are still problems, though, especially when the pandemic has driven increased awareness for home-share competitors such as  Expedia ’s  Vrbo.</td>

Twitter, which received many of the takedown requests, blocked the posts in India, though they remained visible outside the country.<br />“Certain people are misusing social media to create panic in society,” India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said in a statement Monday, when asked about the blocks. It didn’t specify which laws were used to issue the orders.<br />Many people on social media reacted with outrage. They said that the posts and others—some from senior opposition politicians—were political speech, arguing that Prime Minister Narendra Modi hasn’t done enough to curb India’s mammoth coronavirus surge, which shows no signs of slowing down from setting global records.<br />India recorded more than 350,000 new cases on Monday as hospitals are overwhelmed, oxygen is in short supply and crematoriums are running out of space. India has logged more than 2,000 deaths a day for six straight days and it is now the epicenter of the global pandemic.</td>

      <td>Tesla Inc.  is expected to post a record quarterly profit after the bell, fueled by rising deliveries despite supply disruptions and mounting concerns about the safety of its battery-powered vehicles.<br />The Silicon Valley car company has enjoyed booming sales, driven by both its popular Model Y compact sport-utility vehicle and sustained demand in China. Tesla earlier this month said it delivered roughly 184,800 vehicles in the first three months of the year, more than double the number during the same period a year earlier. The company, which delivered nearly half a million vehicles in 2020, has said it expects that figure to rise more than 50% this year.<br />Wall Street on average expects Tesla on Monday to report first-quarter sales of about $10.5 billion and net income of around $509 million, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. The company generated roughly $6 billion in sales and a $16 million profit during the period a year earlier, when its lone U.S. car plant, in Fremont, Calif., was temporarily idled by the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The company’s anticipated strong financial start to the year comes as it faces challenges on other fronts. Federal auto-safety officials are investigating the fatal fiery crash of a Model S sedan earlier this month in Texas. Neither of the victims was found in the driver’s seat, local officials have said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s probe of the wreck is one of more than two dozen investigations of crashes involving Tesla vehicles.<br />Tesla has also faced parts shortages that led the company to briefly shut down its Fremont factory in February. Rivals such as  General Motors Co. ,  Ford Motor Co.  and  Volkswagen AG  have had to idle some production capacity because of a global semiconductor shortage.</td>

Now it’s eyeing an even bigger prize: success in games.<br />The Chinese company’s latest game, One Piece: The Voyage, based on a popular Japanese anime, has been the most downloaded free game in  Apple ’s  App Store in China since its launch last week. More games, including The King of Fighters: All Stars, based on a famous gaming franchise, are in the pipeline.<br />Bytedance has been in games for a few years, but not as a main line of business. The company is stepping up its push, targeting the more lucrative serious gamers. Two recent deals have signaled its ambitions: In March it acquired Moonton, a Chinese game company founded by a former Tencent employee, and bought C4-Games this month.<br />Moonton’s flagship title, Mobile Legends, is one of the most popular games in southeast Asia. That game has generated more than $880 million in revenue world-wide since 2016 across both the App Store and Google Play, with around 408 million downloads, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower. And that number doesn’t include gamers using third-party app stores. C4 has also been strong outside of China: Its Houchi Shoujo is one of the best performing games overseas from a Chinese company, due to its popularity in Japan.<br />All this comes at a time when China’s Tencent, the world’s largest game company, is also looking to expand overseas. The company’s PUBG Mobile is one of the top-grossing mobile games globally, downloaded more than a billion times outside of China since its launch in 2018. Tencent had more than half of China’s mobile-gaming market in the first half of 2020,  according to research firm Analysys.</td>

He has taken business responsibilities away from some top personnel, such as CNBC Chairman Mark Hoffman, the people said.<br />Like other news channels, NBC’s networks may have a tougher time sustaining high viewership with Donald Trump, a ratings magnet, out of the White House.</td>

Meanwhile, yields on U.S. government bonds and certain derivatives are suggesting the economy will be strong enough for the Federal Reserve to start raising short-term interest rates by 2023 and keep going for a couple of additional years.<br />In essence, investors are betting that a combination of government stimulus and coronavirus vaccines can drive a quick return to the economy that existed just before the pandemic. Back then, a decade of slow, steady growth had finally started to produce meaningful gains for even low-skilled workers.<br />Still, investors seem skeptical of an even-better outcome in which the economy’s capacity for growth is lifted by favorable demographic changes, technological innovation or government investment. Here is a closer look at investors’ bets on the economy:<br />Investors’ optimism about the future is apparent in stocks as well as bonds. Major indexes have continued to climb this year even as Treasury yields have shot upward, another sign of investors’ confidence that the economy can withstand higher interest rates.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—In 2016, a U.S. defense contractor named PlanetRisk Inc. was working on a software prototype when its employees discovered they could track U.S. military operations through the data generated by the apps on the mobile phones of American soldiers.<br />At the time, the company was using location data drawn from apps such as weather, games and dating services to build a surveillance tool that could monitor the travel of refugees from Syria to Europe and the U.S., according to interviews with former employees. The company’s goal was to sell the tool to U.S. counterterrorism and intelligence officials.<br />But buried in the data was evidence of sensitive U.S. military operations by American special-operations forces in Syria. The company’s analysts could see phones that had come from military facilities in the U.S., traveled through countries like Canada or Turkey and were clustered at the abandoned Lafarge Cement Factory in northern Syria, a staging area at the time for U.S. special-operations and allied forces.<br />The discovery was an early look at what today has become a significant challenge for the U.S. armed forces: how to protect service members, intelligence officers and security personnel in an age where highly revealing commercial data being generated by mobile phones and other digital services is bought and sold in bulk, and available for purchase by America’s adversaries.<br />The U.S. government has built robust programs to track terrorists and criminals through warrantless access to commercial data.

Miners and some investors say that is changing after years of OPEC-like discipline by the two biggest producers. Adding to their optimism, governments including the Biden administration and Beijing see a role for nuclear power in global efforts to mitigate climate change.<br />Investors have been sending shares in companies including Canada’s  Denison Mines Corp.  and Corpus Christi, Texas-based  Uranium Energy Corp.  higher starting late last year. The  Global X Uranium ETF ,  which tracks shares of companies with operations linked to uranium and nuclear components, has surged 76% since the end of October.<br />The gains have led to a new phenomenon: Aspiring miners are raising cash to buy the commodity that they hope to dig out of the ground. That is unprecedented in such large quantities, traders and analysts say.<br />One reason is the vagaries of the market for uranium, which is unlike that for most other commodities. Between 70% and 80% of uranium ore concentrate is sold in long-term contracts to utilities with nuclear-power plants.</td>

      <td>Hollywood stages a glitzy comeback; the awards ceremony was held at a working transit hub</td>
      <td>“Nomadland” won the award for best picture Sunday at the 93rd Academy Awards, where Hollywood tried to make a case for the power of movies and turn a corner after 14 months of existential crisis for the industry.<br />“Please watch our movie on the largest screen possible,” said Frances McDormand, a producer of “Nomadland” and its star, in her acceptance speech, urging viewers to return to movie theaters “shoulder to shoulder in that dark space.”<br />With its vistas of the American West, “Nomadland” was a counterpoint to the cooped-up reality for many viewers in pandemic, and offered a somber tale of resilience, with a character learning to live on society’s margins, played by Ms. McDormand, who also won the Oscar for best actress.<br /><br />The film’s director, Chloé Zhao, became only the second woman (after Kathryn Bigelow) to win the Academy Award for best director. The Beijing-born Ms. Zhao is also the first Asian woman to win that award.</td>

      <td>China has been making steady if slow progress on reducing coal as a percentage of its energy mix</td>
      <td>Last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping committed to reducing his country’s coal consumption beginning in 2026. That is later than many climate change activists had hoped, but it will still be a challenge for the world’s largest coal consumer.<br />One thing that might help—while also smoothing over relations with Uncle Sam—would be more cooperation on natural gas development and trade.<br />China has been making steady if slow progress on reducing coal as a percentage of its energy mix: 56.8% of energy consumed in China came from coal last year, down from 69.2% in 2010. Despite an enormous renewable power investment binge in 2020, unleashed as part of the nation’s stimulus efforts, thermal coal power has also proved stubbornly resilient. In March, Chinese thermal power output rose 25.7% from a year earlier, outpacing overall power output growth by close to 10 percentage points.<br />Beijing’s policies on new coal power plants have also been highly mercurial in recent years. In early 2021, China had 247 gigawatts of coal power capacity under development according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air. That is 21% above end-2019 levels and about six times the size of Germany’s entire coal fleet.<br />And as it happens, all those new wind turbines and solar power plants don’t actually mix well with coal power, which is less convenient to turn on and off than natural gas when the wind suddenly starts blowing or the sun stops shining. Until last year, China had been making good progress on reducing wind power wastage—only 3.4% of wind power went to waste in the first three quarters of 2020 compared with 17% in 2016, according to China’s energy regulator. But with 72 gigawatts of wind power added last year—roughly three times the average annual increase from 2015 to 2019—that happy trend might be hard to maintain.</td>

      <td>Stars like Emerald Fennell, Alan Kim, Regina King, and Leslie Odom Jr. arrived at the scaled-back, live red-carpet event wearing both polished and surprising looks</td>
      <td>Hollywood is ready to get dressed up again. After a year of pandemic isolation, closed movie theaters and virtual awards ceremonies, the Oscars returned to a scaled-down but lively red carpet at Union Station in Los Angeles Sunday. Additional hubs in Paris and London provided opportunities for nominees across the pond to gather. Exuberance—both sartorial and emotional—was on display. “People are just dying to be out,” said E presenter Naz Perez.<br />According to an email from the show’s producers, the dress code for this hybrid event was described as “a fusion of inspirational and aspirational, which in actual words means formal is totally cool if you want to go there, but casual is really not.” Stars appeared to have interpreted this as a call for fun and flair, with unorthodox suiting, surprising choices and lots of color all in full effect.<br />“After a year of not getting dressed, obviously everyone is like let’s get dressed,” said Michael Fisher, a New York-based celebrity stylist, who dressed presenter Bryan Cranston in a classically appointed tuxedo by Prada.<br />Many men departed from that classic script, taking this modified red carpet as an opportunity for maximum rule breaking. Colman Domingo of “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” made a splash in a taut flamingo-pink, three-piece suit by Atelier Versace that was embellished with 4,500 Swarovski crystals. Fan favorite Alan Kim, the 9-year-old “Minari” star, wore a Thom Browne shorts suit with dark knee socks (but his best accessory preshow was his adorable puppy Cream).<br />For several stars, their exuberance appeared to take the form of dressing as an actual Oscar statuette, by dressing in attention-grabbing gold. Leslie Odom Jr., who starred as Sam Cooke in “One Night in Miami…,” arrived in a metallic gold Brioni suit with a matching gold shirt and pocket square. Andra Day, nominated for her role as Billie Holiday in “The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” drew inspiration from the icon herself, as well as Diana Ross in her interpretation, for her gold metal mesh Vera Wang gown. Best-actress nominee for “Promising Young Woman,” Carey Mulligan wore a golden combo by Valentino Haute Couture. Questlove, the musical director for the show, finished off his otherwise dark outfit with a pair of shimmering gold Crocs.</td>

      <td>The governor changed the curfew for bars and restaurants recently despite amended law</td>
      <td>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s recent extension of a statewide curfew on bars and restaurants shows the limits of a law intended to curtail the unilateral powers he received in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, Republican lawmakers say.<br />The law was enacted in early March, as the Democratic governor grappled with accusations that he sexually harassed former female aides and requests for documents from federal prosecutors about the state’s policies around Covid-19 in nursing homes.<br />Facing public pressure to respond, state lawmakers voted to amend a March 2020 law that gave Mr. Cuomo the power to issue unilateral directives necessary to cope with any declared disaster. He used it during the pandemic to issue more than 150 executive orders that closed schools, changed election procedures and set parameters for business operations.<br />The amended law prevents the governor from issuing new directives, but it allows him to extend existing rules if he gives notice to the Democrat-dominated state Assembly and Senate. He did so last Monday, signing an executive order that pushed back the curfew for bars and restaurants to midnight from 11 p.m., starting on April 19 and effective until May 19. The businesses would also still be required to sell food along with drinks. Restaurateurs object to the policies, which they say hurt sales and don’t have a clear public-health rationale.<br />Republicans said the episode shows that the changes enacted this year were little more than for show. They said the curfew should expire.</td>

      <td>The Senate passed a hate-crimes bill last week that gives grants to states and localities for more reporting on incidents and orders a Justice Department review. The vote was 94-1. But that bipartisan vote obscures a sharp partisan difference on anti-Asian bias laid bare as Democrats defeated a Republican amendment to stop discrimination in higher education.<br />The GOP amendment was a single sentence. It said no college “may receive any Federal funding if the institution has a policy in place or engages in a practice that discriminates against Asian Americans in recruitment, applicant review, or admissions.”<br />All Republicans voted for the amendment, which was sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Democrats voted it down, 49-48.<br />Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono said on the floor that the amendment was “a transparent and cynical attack on longstanding admission policies that serve to increase diversity.” She means elite college policies that have been challenged in court by Asian-American students for penalizing them in admissions.<br />Ms. Hirono apparently thinks it’s “cynical” to take seriously the language in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Constitution that bars discrimination by race. The amendment surely would have passed if the text had substituted another minority group for “Asian Americans.” Yet it did not get a single Democratic vote.</td>

      <td>Biden’s capital-gains rate of 43.4% would reduce federal revenue.</td>
      <td>If you need more evidence that ideology more than common sense is driving the Biden Presidency, look no further than its trial balloon to raise the top tax rate on capital gains to 43.4%. It’s the dumbest way to raise taxes for many reasons, not least because it will cost the government revenue.<br />The premise behind the tax increase is that a preferential tax rate for long-term capital gains is an unjustified loophole. (Gains on assets held for less than a year are taxed at the individual income rate.) Yet that preferential rate has persisted for decades, through Democratic and Republican administrations. The current top rate is 23.8%, which includes a 3.8% ObamaCare surcharge on income above $200,000. Even in the economically irrational 1970s the top capital-gains rate never broke 40%, as the nearby chart shows.<br />There are good economic and fairness reasons for the preferential rate. First, under current tax rules, all gains from investments are fully taxed, but all losses are not fully deductible. Losses can offset gains in any given year, but losses that exceed gains can only be offset against personal income up to $3,000. The preferential rate compensates for this asymmetry.<br />Second, gains in asset values aren’t adjusted for inflation, so investors who hold assets for an extended period pay taxes on increases that are partly illusory. Other parts of the tax code, including the income-tax brackets, are indexed for inflation, but not capital gains that arguably need it the most since assets are often held for decades.<br />Third, a capital-gains tax is a second tax on corporate income. A neutral revenue code would tax all income only once. But the U.S. also taxes business profits when they are earned, and President Biden wants to raise that tax rate by a third (to 28% from 21%). When a business distributes after-tax income in dividends, or an investor sells the shares that have risen in value due to higher earnings, the income is taxed a second time.</td>

      <td>After Beijing’s trade bullying, Australia tears up two investment deals.</td>
      <td>China increasingly wields its economic power as a political weapon, but that often courts a backlash. The latest example is Australia, where Foreign Minister Marise Payne last week exercised new discretionary power to kill two investment agreements between the state of Victoria and the Chinese government.<br />Beijing had planned to cooperate with Victoria on infrastructure, biotech, advanced manufacturing and technology. A 2018 memorandum of understanding and a 2019 framework agreement, both nixed last week, are part of China’s Belt and Road initiative, which seeks to use money and soft power to expand its global influence.<br />Australia knows what China’s bare-knuckle economic diplomacy looks like. Canberra banned Chinese telecom companies from its 5G network in 2018 and last year Australia supported an independent probe into the origin of Covid-19. China is Australia’s top trade partner, and the Communist Party has responded with tariffs and trade restrictions targeting Australian wine, beef, coal, lobster, timber, barley, sugar and copper ore.<br />Economist Marcel Thieliant estimated that “the goods and services already in the firing line are worth nearly a quarter of Australia’s exports to China” and warned that “the escalating trade war is another reason to think that Australia’s economy will never return to its pre-virus path.” That may be overwrought, but there’s no doubt Australia has lost billions of dollars in commodities sales.<br />This is the context that caused Australia’s Parliament in December to give the foreign minister the authority to review and invalidate agreements between foreign entities and Australian states, territories, local governments or public universities. Lawmakers didn’t want state and local governments cutting deals that undermine Australia’s national interest.</td>

      <td>I’m running for mayor so New York can have both public safety and police accountability.</td>
      <td>Brooklyn, N.Y.<br />As the coronavirus pandemic rolls on, New York City is battling an epidemic of crime. It’s the same battle we’ve been fighting for decades. Violence is on the rise. New Yorkers don’t feel safe in their homes or on the street. Many are avoiding the subways out of fear.<br />As a former police officer who patrolled the streets in a bulletproof vest in the 1990s, I know what I am talking about when I say public safety is the prerequisite to prosperity. All New Yorkers, no matter which neighborhood they live in, should be allowed to feel safe. But the debate around policing has been reduced to a false choice: safety or justice.<br />Every New Yorker needs public safety. We need the police. We also need them to be much better than they are. I know this firsthand because I was brutally beaten by cops as a teenager in South Jamaica, Queens, while in custody at the 103rd Precinct. It was a traumatic experience and the reason I became a police officer. I wanted to change the New York City Police Department from the inside. As an officer on the street, I learned that good cops can save lives.<br />To protect people from violent crime and prevent police abuse, we need to recognize that the same communities suffer from both. We must also recognize that reducing crime restores trust, and that measures to restore trust reduce crime when communities work with police to stop violence.</td>

      <td>The CDC is moving too slowly in updating its advice to comport with the scientific evidence.</td>
      <td>When fighting a crisis like Covid-19, health officials can never take for granted the public’s willingness to comply. The measures imposed—social distancing, wearing masks—require sacrifice. As conditions improve, policy makers must show they’re willing to ease restrictions as swiftly as they imposed them, and a critical early test will be on wearing masks outside.<br />Wearing masks and restricting large gatherings were essential to controlling the pandemic’s worst peaks. But infection levels are dropping and vaccination rates rising. This is the time to revisit rules on masking and distancing in low-risk outdoor settings like parks and sports venues. Easing these rules would move more activity outdoors, which reduces viral transmission.<br />In states such as Texas and New Hampshire, governors have lifted restraints on the size of outdoor gatherings and the need for masks. Connecticut, Rhode Island and others have announced plans to relax outdoor requirements in May. But the policy process in Washington is moving too slowly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance still prescribes social limits while outside. Many governors are reluctant to step out ahead of the agency. About half of states still require people to wear face coverings in all public settings.<br />The virus won’t be eliminated. Some 40,000 Americans are hospitalized and some 55,000 cases are diagnosed each day. But more than 80% of Americans over 65 are protected by a vaccine, and infection rates are declining rapidly in most states—including Michigan, this month’s worst-hit. Vaccines are available to anyone over 16 in every state. Soon the problem will be a surplus of doses.<br />Consider a well-known study conducted in China last spring. Researchers traced 318 outbreaks to figure out the chains of transmission. In only one of 318 outbreaks did the initial cases come from contact while outside. The rest originated inside homes or on mass transit.</td>

      <td>A top Obama scientist looks at the evidence on warming and CO2 emissions and rebuts much of the dominant political narrative.</td>
      <td>Physicist Steven Koonin kicks the hornet’s nest right out of the gate in “Unsettled.” In the book’s first sentences he asserts that “the Science” about our planet’s climate is anything but “settled.” Mr. Koonin knows well that it is nonetheless a settled subject in the minds of most pundits and politicians and most of the population.<br />Further proof of the public’s sentiment: Earlier this year the United Nations Development Programme published the mother of all climate surveys, titled “The Peoples’ Climate Vote.” With more than a million respondents from 50 countries, the survey, unsurprisingly, found “64% of people said that climate change was an emergency.”<br />But science itself is not conducted by polls, regardless of how often we are urged to heed a “scientific consensus” on climate. As the science-trained novelist Michael Crichton summarized in a famous 2003 lecture at Caltech: “If it’s consensus, it isn’t science. If it’s science, it isn’t consensus. Period.” Mr. Koonin says much the same in “Unsettled.”<br />The book is no polemic. It’s a plea for understanding how scientists extract clarity from complexity. And, as Mr. Koonin makes clear, few areas of science are as complex and multidisciplinary as the planet’s climate.<br />He begins with a kind of trigger warning for readers who may be shocked by the book’s contradiction of four points of climate orthodoxy: “Heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900” and “the warmest temperatures in the US have not risen in the past fifty years. . . . Humans have had no detectable impact on hurricanes over the past century. . . . Greenland’s ice sheet isn’t shrinking any more rapidly today than it was eighty years ago. . . . The net economic impact of human-induced climate change will be minimal through at least the end of this century.”</td>

      <td>Here, the suffix tends to be pejorative and not about selling.</td>
      <td>Walking around London a few years ago, I’d occasionally see signs that said “Fishmonger” or “Cheesemonger.” In the U.K. “monger” is often the second half of a neutral compound that describes what someone sells. In the U.S. it tends to be used differently; it’s usually the second half of a pejorative term like “hatemonger.”<br />This American use describes someone who is driven by an ugly or foolish passion. In the late 1960s protesters against the Vietnam War often shouted “Warmongers!” when they met counterdemonstrators. Some antiwar activists today embrace the counterphrase “peace mongers.”<br />In the past 50 years the number of pejorative monger terms has proliferated. We now have fear monger, scandalmonger, power monger, atrocity monger, grievance monger, conspiracy monger. I could go on.<br />The most popular use nowadays may be fear monger. Republicans accuse Democrats of fear mongering about global warming; Democrats claim Republicans do the same on illegal immigration.<br />According to the Oxford English Dictionary, monger comes from the classical Latin mango—meaning dealer or trader. The word may also have Germanic roots; mongari is an Old Saxon word. The OED says a monger is “a merchant, trader, dealer, or trafficker (frequently of a specified commodity).” Costermonger originally denoted an apple seller, but “in later use,” particularly in London, “a person who sells fruit, vegetables, fish, etc., in the street from a barrow or handcart.”</td>

Amid a surge in bitcoin and other digital currencies over the past year, those bets have ballooned in size, while the fund’s exposure to regional bank stocks—what it is best known for—fell to one-third of assets in February, the lowest in its 23-year history.<br />Morningstar’s decision to downgrade the fund, disclosed late last week, could have ripple effects for Emerald Advisers.

      <td>WASHINGTON—Two centrist senators key to negotiations over infrastructure spending signaled progress in talks but made clear they don’t support President Biden’s expansive $2.3 trillion proposal.<br />Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) said Sunday he wants the focus to be on conventional infrastructure like highways and bridges and that spending should be split off from broader items in Mr. Biden’s proposal, such as $400 billion to help care for the aging and those with disabilities.<br />“I do think they should be separated. Because if you start putting so much into one bill, which we call an omnibus bill, it makes it very, very difficult for the public to understand,” Mr. Manchin said on CNN.<br />Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, also from West Virginia, said she had received positive feedback from the White House after she helped craft a $568 billion infrastructure proposal, which was cast as a starting point for bipartisan negotiations.<br />“This is an active conversation, and I think that it’s a good beginning,” she said on CNN of the plan, which doesn’t provide specifics on how to fund the investments and some Democrats say is far too limited.</td>

      <td>He wants to raise the rate on capital gains so high that it would leave everyone worse off.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration last week proposed to increase the capital-gains tax rate—currently 20% for most assets held for at least a year—to 39.6% for people making more than $1 million. Since capital gains are also subject to the 3.8% Medicare tax, the new capital-gains rate would be 43.4%.<br />What makes this unusual is that 43.4% is well above the rate that would generate the most revenue for the government. Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, which does the official scoring and is no den of supply siders, puts the revenue-maximizing rate at 28%. My work several decades ago puts it about 10 points lower than that. That means President Biden is willing to accept lower revenue as the price of higher tax rates. The implications for his administration’s economic thinking are mind-boggling.<br />Even the revenue-maximizing rate is higher than would be optimal. As tax rates rise, the activity being taxed declines. The loss to the private side of society increases at a geometric rate (proportional to the square of the tax rate) as rates rise. The government collects more revenue, but its gains slow as the taxed activity declines. The revenue-maximizing rate is the point at which the government starts losing from higher taxes. Tax rates above the revenue-maximizing rate are punitive: The government is giving up revenue simply to punish the rich.<br />Punishing the rich is distinct from redistribution. Higher taxes on the rich to finance spending, or to transfer money to lower-income people, may be good for society’s welfare. Economists express this idea in a “social-welfare function,” which weights additional income received by different people, usually based on income. The same sum is considered less valuable if it goes to a high-income person than a lower-income one. The weights are subjective and different analysts will choose different weights.<br />Still, economists can agree that the ideal is to make someone better off without making someone else worse off. The simplest case is a voluntary exchange of goods for money, in which the buyer values the purchase at least as much as the price, while the seller values the money at least as much as the item being sold. Economists call such an exchange Pareto-optimal after Vilfredo Pareto, the Italian economist who formally framed the concept.</td>

      <td>Circular logic works its mischief, from phony election claims to ‘systemic racism.’</td>
      <td>Garage bands know about feedback loops. If you place a microphone in front of speakers, the sound picked up by the mic gets amplified and then fed out to the speakers, which the mic picks up and it gets amplified again and again. The circular process turns the sound into a screech or squeal.<br />After the presidential election, some Trump supporters filled  Twitter  with conspiracy theories of election fraud, including a mysterious box in a red wagon in Detroit, ballots “magically found” in Milwaukee at 3 a.m., and fraudulent Georgia signature checks. Almost all were made-up nonsense, later disproved. But President Trump repeated many of these claims, especially in his Jan. 6 “Save America” rally speech: “They should absolutely find that just over 11,000 votes, that’s all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia, and we’re not going to forget it.”<br />The same squid-brained cosplayers who made this stuff up in the first place then believed Mr. Trump when he said, “Make no mistake, this election [was] stolen from you, from me and from the country” and stormed the Capitol. This is the worst case of squealing circular logic that I’ve ever seen.<br />But not the only one. We had endured a summer of protests, with charges of “systemic racism” and calls to “defund the police.” In a June article, former presidential candidate Kamala Harris wrote that “structural racism lives on in our policies and everyday life.” This systemic stuff is good politics.<br />Or is it? Last month, at U.S.-China summit in Anchorage, Alaska, Secretary of State Antony Blinken brought up “deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan.” The top Chinese diplomat, Yang Jiechi, responded with a 15-minute tirade in which he asserted that “the challenges facing the United States in human rights are deep-seated. They did not just emerge over the past four years, such as Black Lives Matter.” I wonder where he got that idea. Circular thinking. Who’s fooling whom?</td>

They question how Georgia partisans’ new power to replace a duly elected county elections board with a single person allows interference with an election. Alarmingly, the law states that a performance review board can be created to investigate and replace officials if the state election board “determines that there is evidence which calls into question the competence of a local election official regarding the oversight and administration of elections, voter registration, or both”—with no definition as to how that might be determined.<br />Microsoft  President Brad Smith complained that the urban counties where Microsoft’s employees live “likely will see an 80 percent reduction in drop boxes, from 40 during the 2020 election to only about eight” and a denial of standard provisional ballots for voters who arrive at changed precincts.

Here’s a look at the why, what and how of overhauling the Supreme Court.<br />No. The first Supreme Court, which had its initial session in 1790, consisted of a chief justice and five associates. Congress altered the number of justices six times in the 19th century. Sometimes it was done in reaction to the court’s political direction, as in 1863, during the Civil War, when President Abraham Lincoln appointed an extra member in a bid to neutralize a pro-Southern majority. The court has had nine members since 1869.<br />Democrats say Republicans unfairly strong-armed a conservative supermajority onto the Supreme Court when they controlled the Senate, first by refusing to hold hearings when President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland (now the U.S. attorney general) in March 2016, a month after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative. That kept the seat open for more than a year, allowing President Donald Trump to appoint Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed in April 2017.<br />The Democrats’ ire redoubled in October 2020 when the GOP-controlled Senate confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett eight days before the presidential election. “Nothing is off the table,” Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, now the majority leader, had warned in September as Republicans mobilized to install Justice Barrett, a conservative, to fill the seat vacated by the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</td>

Its first step down that road will be to start talking about it in the coming months or weeks—Chairman Jerome Powell’s next big test with financial markets.<br />Officials will begin by debating how and when to scale back, or taper, the $120 billion-plus of Treasury and mortgage bonds the Fed has been buying each month since last June to hold down long-term borrowing costs.<br />That conversation hasn’t yet kicked off, according to public comments from central bankers and minutes from their March 16-17 policy meeting. The Fed said in a postmeeting statement that the U.S. labor market and inflation would have to make “substantial further progress” before it begins to reduce its bond program. Asked at a press conference whether it was time to start talking about talking about reducing bond purchases, Chairman Jerome Powell said, “Not yet.”<br />At the time, economic forecasts were calling for a pickup in growth, but hard data were still reflecting a slowdown during the winter Covid-19 surge.

It is using a downsizing at Emirates to hire staff. And while other airlines have reduced services to markets closed by Covid-19, state-backed Qatar is pursuing new landing rights to emerge stronger post pandemic.<br />In the past 12 months, Qatar has flown more seats further than any other airline on cross-border routes, according to data firm OAG.

Data Thursday are expected to show  the U.S. growth accelerated in the first quarter as coronavirus-related restrictions eased and vaccination coverage increased.<br />In Europe, where vaccination drives have been beset with supply hiccups and worries over side effects, economies are likely to take longer to shake off their lockdown-induced torpor. Data Friday are expected to show the 19-nation eurozone shrank in the first quarter as chunks of the currency area reimposed public-health restrictions to tame new waves of infection, though more up-to-date business surveys suggest growth was already coming back in April.</td>

      <td>Veteran investors are unnerved by bubble-like conditions</td>
      <td>Markets for everything from home-building materials to bitcoin to stocks are soaring, stirring up fresh fears that global markets are in a bubble.<br />Rarely have so many assets been up this much at once.<br />The price of lumber has shot up to all-time highs. Residential home sales in the U.S. are at levels last seen in 2006, before the housing bubble collapsed. And stocks are on a tear. Benchmark indexes from the U.S. to France to Australia have all climbed to fresh highs this year, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average recently hitting their 23rd and 21st records of the year, respectively.<br />The frenzy has extended far beyond conventional markets tracked by Wall Street firms. Bitcoin hurtled above $60,000 for the first time last month before pulling back, while Dogecoin briefly jumped to a record, driven by fans posting hashtags like #DogeDay on Twitter. In the venture-capital world, investors are offering startups five times or more the amount of money they are requesting, and the average valuation for all startups has hit a new high.<br />Markets’ wild ride higher has even the most seasoned investors throwing up their hands.</td>

      <td>Many individual investors take losses on SPACs, while insiders benefit from discount stakes</td>
      <td>Investors who bought into a special-purpose acquisition company that took a healthcare-services company public last year in an $11 billion deal have suffered steep losses. Promoters of the SPAC still stand to make millions.<br />The paper gains for insiders, even as shares of  MultiPlan Corp.  fall, result from the unique incentives given to SPAC creators, also known as sponsors. They are allowed to buy 20% of the company at a deep discount, a stake that is then transferred into the firm the SPAC takes public. Those extremely cheap shares let the creators make, on average, several times their initial investment. They also let the SPAC backers make money even if the company they take public struggles and later investors lose money, a source of criticism for the process.<br />In the case of MultiPlan, the SPAC was called Churchill Capital Corp. III and the sponsor was former  Citigroup Inc.  deal maker Michael Klein. He shared the discounted investments with other advisers at his investment bank, M. Klein & Co., and financial partners in a way that goes beyond what was publicly disclosed, according to a statement from the SPAC team’s spokesman.<br />Even though MultiPlan shares are down about 30% since early October, those shares and other investments are valued at about $140 million at today’s prices, and only cost the sponsor team roughly $20 million, according an analysis of regulatory filings by New York University Law School professor Michael Ohlrogge, who studies SPACs and corporate incentives.<br />The SPAC spokesman didn’t dispute the figures.</td>

      <td>Louisiana lawmaker Troy Carter defeated Karen Carter Peterson, a fellow state legislator, in a runoff election for Congress that boosted the Democratic Party’s slim majority in the House.<br />The Associated Press called the contest for Mr. Carter, who led Ms. Carter Peterson by roughly 10 percentage points with more than 90% of precincts reporting. The pair of Democratic state senators from New Orleans earned spots in the runoff after leading a field of over a dozen candidates in March.<br />All candidates regardless of party competed against each other in the primary. No candidate topped 50% of the March vote, triggering Saturday’s runoff election. No Republican earned enough votes to advance to the runoff, so the seat was certain to remain in the Democratic column.<br />If Ms. Carter Peterson had won, she would have been the first Black woman elected to Congress from Louisiana.<br />Mr. Carter earned the early endorsement of former Rep. Cedric Richmond, whose vacated House seat was up for grabs after he joined President Biden’s administration as a senior adviser.</td>
