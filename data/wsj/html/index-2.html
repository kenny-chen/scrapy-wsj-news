      <td>A former state senator says watchdog entity no longer has jurisdiction to pursue an allegation against him</td>
      <td>In 2018, when state Senate staffer Erica Vladimer publicly accused her boss, Bronx state Sen. Jeff Klein, of forcibly kissing her outside an Albany bar, advocates and officials from both political parties called for an independent investigation.<br />Mr. Klein denied the allegation. He asked the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, a watchdog entity charged with enforcing state ethics laws, to investigate. Nearly three years later, the case is still pending. Mr. Klein is out of office and filed a lawsuit in state Supreme Court in Albany County last month saying JCOPE no longer has jurisdiction to pursue the matter because it waited too long to act and the alleged kiss wasn’t related to any government decision-making.<br />A ruling in his favor could limit JCOPE’s authority to investigate claims of sexual misconduct. For JCOPE critics such as state Sen. Liz Krueger, the continuing saga shows the need to create a better mechanism for complaints involving state officials.<br />“Clearly, it’s not working,” said Ms. Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan. “You want to go as high and independent as you possibly can get. And the dilemma, frankly, is that we don’t have that system.”<br />Jay Musoff, Mr. Klein’s lawyer, said he was “confident that any investigation would determine that Jeff did not abuse any state resources or that his alleged conduct did not affect state business.” Mr. Musoff said JCOPE was “kicking the can down the road.”</td>

      <td>The GOP stunt over the Electoral College will hurt the country and the party.</td>
      <td>As Americans like to tell the world, a hallmark of democracy is the willingness to accept defeat and the peaceful transfer of power. The tragedy of the last two presidential elections has been the refusal of partisans to accept defeat, and public trust in American self-government is eroding as a result.<br />Democrats in 2016 abused the FBI to push the Russia collusion myth and refused to accept Donald Trump’s legitimacy. Hillary Clinton still doesn’t. Now some Republicans are returning the disfavor by challenging the ritual counting of the Electoral College votes by the new Congress this week. Neither one justifies the other, and these columns have called out Democrats for their anti-democratic panic attack.<br />But the main issue now is that too many Republicans refuse to accept Mr. Trump’s defeat. More than 100 House Members and, as of this weekend, at least 12 Senators say they will formally object to the Electoral College count. This won’t change the result, though it will delay it as Congress spends up to two hours debating the objections to each state’s results. More corrosive will be the precedent and resulting political damage.<br />The leading culprit here is Mr. Trump, who as always refuses to accept responsibility for defeat. Recall that he also claimed the Iowa caucus result was stolen in 2016 when he lost to Ted Cruz. He’s now spinning conspiracy theories and election falsehoods daily on  Twitter .  He doesn’t seem to care what damage he does in promoting the myth of his victory.<br />The damage is spreading as Mr. Trump puts pressure on other Republicans to take up his lost cause. A dozen Senators have issued a statement demanding an Electoral Commission that would investigate claims of fraud and report within 10 days. The plan is to persuade state legislatures to overrule their Dec. 14 Electoral College certifications for Joe Biden. Throw the election into the House and Mr. Trump might salvage a second term.</td>

      <td>Biden is right to resist calls to forgive student debt by fiat.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden campaigned for legislation that would cancel $10,000 in student debt for each borrower. That’s the bad news. The good news is that he is resisting progressive calls to ram through $50,000 in student debt forgiveness for each borrower via executive fiat.<br />The Washington Post’s Karen Tumulty quotes Mr. Biden as skeptical of the progressive demand: “I’m going to get in trouble for saying this . . . for example, it’s arguable that the President may have the executive power to forgive up to $50,000 in student debt. Well, I think that’s pretty questionable. I’m unsure of that. I’d be unlikely to do that.”<br />When Mr. Biden says he’s going to get “in trouble,” he means with such allies as Elizabeth Warren. The Massachusetts Senator claims the President can cancel $50,000 in debt—and have taxpayers pick up the bill—without going through Congress.<br />A coalition of 238 progressive groups recently signed a letter urging Mr. Biden to invoke his “executive authority to cancel federal student debt on Day One of your administration.” Backing Sen. Warren’s plan, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says, “We have come to the conclusion that President Biden can undo this debt, can forgive $50,000 of debt the first day he becomes president. You don’t need Congress. All you need is the flick of a pen.”<br />We’d like to see the bill in which Congress said students could borrow and not pay it back. But Mr. Schumer is echoing Barack Obama’s notorious line in his second term that he could govern alone because “I’ve got a pen and I’ve got a phone.” And Mr. Obama tried, courting a political backlash that helped to elect Donald Trump.</td>

      <td>Chinese regulators are effectively breaking up Ant Group’s fin-tech empire, and there’s a lesson here for investors. Ant’s deconstruction is a reminder that businesses in China live or die at the sufferance of the Communist Party.<br />Jack Ma founded Ant in 2004 as “Alipay” to process payments for his e-commerce site Alibaba. He exploited the credit shortages in China’s state-dominated banking system by expanding into financial services such as insurance, money-management, personal credit ratings and consumer loans.<br />Party leaders tolerated Ant because it helped fuel their goal of making China’s economy more consumer-driven. But regulators have slapped down Ant at times when they think it is threatening the government’s control of capital—for instance, by limiting returns on Ant money-market funds that had drawn deposits from state banks.<br />Global investors in 2018 bought stakes in Ant—then valued at about $150 billion—to capitalize on China’s growth and government restrictions on foreign competition. Mr. Ma aimed to raise another $34 billion in an initial public offering, with estimates of Ant’s potential valuation at more than $300 billion.<br />The entrepreneur planned to launch the IPO on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges, which would draw more foreign capital to Chinese markets. But in October Mr. Ma apparently forgot he was in China and criticized Beijing’s financial controls. Regulators abruptly halted Ant’s IPO and presented Mr. Ma with a litany of vague grievances.</td>

      <td>The Constitutions is clear. Neither the vice president or Congress has the power to reject electoral votes.</td>
      <td>Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert has argued that the Electoral Count Act of 1887 is unconstitutional. Therefore, he claims, Vice President Mike Pence is empowered by the 12th Amendment to reject 73 Biden-Harris electoral votes from five states when Congress meets to certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6. A dozen Republican senators and many more House members also argue that Congress has this power. They are all wrong.<br />Neither the vice president nor Congress has the power to reject electoral votes. This is because the 12th Amendment vests no power in the vice president or Congress to judge who won a state’s electoral votes when the authorized branches of the state’s government agree, as they do here, on which electors won.<br />The 12th Amendment left intact the Constitution’s Electors Clause. As the Supreme Court’s three originalist justices wrote in Bush v. Gore (2000), under the Electors Clause, each state’s legislature by statute makes the exclusive “apportionment of responsibility” to state officials to “oversee election disputes” that decide which presidential ticket won the most votes in that state. Election officials and courts from each of the five states in question did exactly that. And by Dec. 14, the states certified that the electors who won were those who voted for Biden-Harris.<br />All the 12th Amendment says is that in a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, “the [electoral] votes shall then be counted.” The word “counted” provides no basis for anyone to override anything. When a person counts the number of games his favorite team has won, that person has no power to alchemize losses into wins.<br />The narrow word “counted” also contrasts sharply with Congress’s constitutional powers concerning congressional elections. Section 5 of Article I expressly provides: “Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of its own members.” The 12th Amendment would not have used the much narrower word “counted” to give the vice president or Congress the power “to be the Judge” for presidential elections.</td>

      <td>To speed up vaccine distribution, let national chains like CVS and Walgreens take a role.</td>
      <td>The federal government built a Covid vaccine delivery scheme to track every dose shipped to the states. Information like location and travel history is available in a software platform developed for “Operation Warp Speed” called Tiberius, so that public-health officials can make sure the limited supply is allotted carefully and fairly.<br />These are important goals, but central control comes with a trade off: it slows down the process of getting shots into arms. Poor local and state planning hasn’t helped. Neither has the trickle of funds the feds have provided to stand up vaccination sites. Add it all up and you have the explanation for the sluggish pace of immunization. Fewer than 5 million people have been vaccinated so far, versus the 20 million promised. Here’s what’s needed to turn things around.<br />First, the government needs to ship more inventory. Right now, the feds are holding back up to 55% of doses. The idea is to make sure there is supply to give everyone a second dose, within three weeks for  Pfizer  and four weeks for Moderna.<br />Sticking to the dose schedule is essential, but supply is expanding and the production processes are proven. Some of the future supply can be given as second doses in those being vaccinated today. The very small possibility that a production snafu could delay second shots seems a reasonable risk to take.<br />Second, the distribution system needs improvement. Standing up vaccination sites and encouraging people to go get the shot is expensive and takes time. The best option may be to rely more on private industry. National pharmacy chains like CVS and  Walgreens  have an agreement with the federal government to provide vaccines to long-term care facilities. The government should expand this program to help vaccinate all Americans.</td>

      <td>They’re on taxpayer-funded salaries while working for the union.</td>
      <td>Should New Jersey’s taxpayers—strained under one of the heaviest tax burdens in the country—be paying public school teachers not to teach? The New Jersey Supreme Court will soon decide whether taxpayers should be required to pay for public employees to work solely for their unions, rather than the jobs they were hired to do.<br />Most assume that tax dollars go toward public goods—maintaining roads, ensuring safety and funding schools. But you don’t have to look hard to find taxpayer dollars going to private interests. Take “release time,” in which government workers are paid not to perform the jobs they were hired to do, and instead to work full-time for private labor unions—all while still receiving their full taxpayer-funded salaries and benefits.<br />Unfortunately, those entrusted with the care and education of children are often the worst abusers of release time. The New Jersey case involves release-time provisions in a collective-bargaining agreement between the Jersey City Board of Education and its teachers union. In that contract, the school board has agreed to pay the salaries of two full-time teachers to work exclusively for the union. While on release time, these teachers engage in political activities, negotiate higher wages and benefits, solicit new union members, attend union conferences and meetings, and file costly grievances against the district.<br />Fortunately, both state law and the New Jersey Constitution prohibit this arrangement. Under state law, the Legislature must expressly authorize a public expenditure like release time before a school board can include it in a contract. The Legislature never did that in this case, and the school board was not authorized to sign off on its own.<br />Like the constitutions of nearly every other state, New Jersey’s Constitution includes a “gift clause” prohibiting the government from giving public resources to private parties. So when the Jersey City School Board provides paid release time for two teachers to engage in private union activities, the Board is violating the state constitution’s gift clause.</td>

      <td>Independent regulators should analyze the costs and benefits of new rules, like executive agencies do.</td>
      <td>The last days of any administration will see “midnight” regulations and other last-ditch agency actions to try to cement the departing appointees’ priorities before the new guys take office. The incoming Biden team will surely do what every new administration does and cancel or overturn many of the executive orders and regulations the Trump administration has issued in recent weeks. But there’s one they should embrace: A Justice Department memorandum to the White House counsel that clears a path for improved decision-making by independent regulatory commissions.<br />The 31-page opinion, which was posted online last week, concludes that presidents “may direct independent agencies to comply with EO 12866”—an executive order issued by President Clinton in 1993 and reaffirmed by both Republican and Democratic presidents since. It requires agencies to perform a cost-benefit analysis on all economically significant regulations and to submit them for review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget before publication. According to President Obama, “the purposes of such review have been to ensure consistency with Presidential priorities, to coordinate regulatory policy, and to offer a dispassionate and analytical ‘second opinion’ on agency actions.”<br />Until last week, independent regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission were excluded from OIRA review and the cost-benefit requirement. These agencies are usually headed by bipartisan boards whose members serve staggered terms. The president nominates but can’t remove them except for good cause. Although Justice prepared a similar opinion in 1981, presidents have been reluctant to act on it in apparent deference to Congress and the Supreme Court’s acquiescence to the notion of “independence” from the executive.<br />The latest memo walks through the possible objections to the president’s authority over rulemaking by independent agencies and finds them lacking. By itself the opinion doesn’t change anything except to provide a basis for equal treatment of all agencies—whether executive branch or independent—that issue regulations with the force of law. But, it gives the president legal support for ordering those independent agencies to comply with the well-accepted requirements of the 1993 executive order. Substantial research shows that agencies not subject to EO 12866 requirements typically don’t undertake cost-benefit analysis and present less evidence than executive-branch agencies about whether a rule will achieve a desired goal.<br />Notably, the memo is dated October 2019 but it wasn’t posted until Wednesday. Executive branch officials often ask the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel to provide opinions regarding the legality of desired executive actions, but the office rarely shares those opinions beyond the requesting parties. There is no indication that President Trump will try to make any process changes based on the opinion (if he did, they would likely be rescinded by Mr. Biden on Inauguration Day). But the memo makes it clear that the option is available to improve the quality of regulations, which would be a valuable instrument for advancing Mr. Biden’s goals. This may be an option that the incoming administration would do well to accept.</td>

      <td>After a 2020 debt restructuring there is no reform agenda to avoid another.</td>
      <td>During the presidential campaign, Joe Biden blamed President Trump’s “incompetence and neglect” for the loss of U.S. sway in Latin America. The implication was that waning American influence in the region could be reversed by a president who paid more attention to the country’s neighbors.<br />Good luck with that. It is true that American values of sound money, low taxes, a light regulatory touch, open markets and the rule of law are no longer in vogue in much of the region. But beyond setting a better example, it’s hard to think of U.S. actions that would make a difference. Unless Mr. Biden plans to champion an aggressive new free-trade agenda for the hemisphere—something his party isn’t known to support—his options are limited.<br />The trouble with the Beltway’s talk about “engagement” is that it’s all too often a euphemism for pushing development aid out the door. Worse, any new round of handouts from the bidenistas would inevitably be tied to Democratic climate claptrap.<br />Nowhere does this approach have worse odds of success than in Argentina, where President Alberto Fernández is running the country into the ground in traditional Argentine fashion. No amount of foreign aid can fix a country where the productive economy has been reduced to a tool to serve the interests of an all-powerful political class.<br />Argentines were frustrated with the failure of center-right President Mauricio Macri to deliver on promises of growth-oriented reform from 2015-19. So they returned the populist left-wing peronists to power in December 2019. Some six months later Argentina defaulted for the ninth time in its history—the third time in 18 years.</td>

      <td>There’s something neurotic about our obsession with physical activity. A specialist in human locomotion offers some perspective.</td>
      <td>Daniel E. Lieberman is one of the world’s most outspoken experts on the effects of physical activity on the human body. So when I read the first pages of his new book, “Exercised: Why Something We Never Evolved to Do Is Healthy and Rewarding,” I was surprised to find that he once hid in a closet to avoid gym class.<br />Doctors, fitness gurus and the media incessantly remind us that exercise leads to healthier and longer lives and thinner and more attractive bodies. We celebrate feats of sporting prowess and lavish attention upon superhero actors with near-pathologically cut torsos. So why, if this is all so good for us, do most of us have relationships with exercise that range from love-hate to hate-hate? Why do we rely on hectoring surveillance technologies like smartwatches to put us through our “required” daily paces?<br />The title of “Exercised” is a clue: There’s something neurotic, vexed, anxious about our obsession with physical activity. In the book, Mr. Lieberman faces down a dozen myths about physical fitness and health, devoting a chapter to each. His lens is evolution—he’s a Harvard paleoanthropologist with a specialty in human locomotion—and he studies the effects of energy-expending bodily movement in the laboratory and in varied groups of people around the world.<br />In one chapter, for example, Mr. Lieberman tackles the myth that sitting is bad for you. Disappointingly he finds that the myth is true, but not in the way most people assume. Contrary to conventional wisdom, slouching postures don’t lead to back pain, as evidenced both by reams of research on office workers and comparisons of sitting styles around the world. The real problem is that people don’t get up and move around enough. As scientists are beginning to understand, long-term inactivity and greater fat around our organs raise the risk of diseases of chronic inflammation, like arthritis and type 2 diabetes. Mr. Lieberman’s prescription? Don’t be inert for too long. Take a break. Get up. Or at least “squirm shamelessly.”<br />Until about two million years ago, every one of our ancestors lived by foraging for wild foods. Human physiology and anatomy adapted to these ancient lifestyles in ways that may not be optimal today. It’s not that we are worse off for this history—indeed, 21st-century Americans live longer, healthier lives than those of any previous era. But sometimes the tricks we once evolved to solve old problems trip us up today.</td>

The new bid comes with financial backing from the MGM’s largest shareholder,  IAC/InterActiveCorp . , the people said.<br />The exact details and value of the new bid couldn’t be learned, but it is above the £12.85 a share MGM had previously offered late last year, the people said. There is no guarantee Entain will be receptive to the new offer or that there will be a deal.<br />A combination could create one of the few large gaming companies in the world with a significant online and bricks-and-mortar presence. It would come on the heels of other recent consolidation in the industry.<br />Like its peers, MGM has been under pressure as the coronavirus pandemic kept its biggest moneymakers—casinos and hotels on the Las Vegas Strip—closed or operating at sharply reduced capacity for much of the year.</td>

      <td>Government aims to immunize majority of people by early spring, accelerating its vaccination drive after early hiccups led to wasted shots</td>
      <td>TEL AVIV—Israel has inoculated nearly half of its most at-risk citizens and more than 10% of the population in two weeks as authorities accelerate a Covid-19 vaccination drive after early hiccups had led to wasted shots.<br />The small country—with roughly nine million people, about the same as New York City—now aims to immunize the majority of its people by early spring. Israel’s vaccination campaign is relatively simple compared with the mass mobilizations needed by countries with many more people and a greater sweep of geography.<br />Israel started with vaccinating its health-care workers and those over the age of 60 on Dec. 20 after receiving early shipments of Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine. By Saturday, it had administered 12.59 doses per 100 of its people, according to the Oxford University-based research group Our World In Data. That rate of inoculation is nearly four times quicker than the second-fastest nation, the tiny Arab Gulf state of Bahrain.<br />“The health system is proving itself,” said Health Minister Yuli Edelstein in an interview Thursday with The Wall Street Journal. Israel boasts of a technologically advanced health-care system to which everyone in the country is registered by law.<br />The rollout offers insights into how authorities are attempting to maximize the campaign’s coverage for the most vulnerable while minimizing wastage of doses, which must be kept extraordinarily cold to keep them from going bad.</td>

      <td>Spending didn’t speed the last recovery, but Biden’s team is keen to keep the money flowing endlessly.</td>
      <td>When President Obama’s last Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, made the extraordinary claim that the Obama economic recovery failed because Washington “stopped [spending] too soon last time, and fiscal tightening after 2010 slowed the recovery” it sounded like another over-the-top argument for more stimulus. But with President-elect Joe Biden now making it clear that the recent $900 billion stimulus will “at best only be a down payment” and the now $3.3 trillion of total stimulus spending “is just the beginning,” it sounds like America is headed into a program of permanent stimulus.<br />Did the Obama recovery atrophy because spending tightened after 2010? Tightened compared with what? Between the start of the subprime mortgage crisis and the end of the recession in mid-2009, net new spending of $1.6 trillion was enacted. In 2009, federal spending as a share of gross domestic product surged by an unprecedented 4.2 percentage points to reach 24.4%, the highest level since World War II. Spending was 23.3% of GDP in 2010. In the entire postwar era through 2008, federal spending averaged 18.9% of GDP. For comparison, consider that the Korean War pushed federal spending only to 19.9%, even as defense spending made up 13.8% of the economy.<br />But what happened after 2010? At 23.4%, 2011 had the second-highest level of federal spending as a share of GDP since World War II—almost one-fourth higher than the postwar average before the Obama era. This is the year when, according to Mr. Lew, federal spending started to plummet. In 2012, federal spending was 22% of GDP, less than the stimulus years but still the fourth-highest level in the postwar period to that point. And 2012 was 3½ years after the recession ended.<br />When the recovery began some six months into the Obama administration, the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office both confidently predicted an economic boom, with real GDP growing an average of 3.6% from 2010-13. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve projected 3.4% growth for 2010-11. These predicted growth levels were well within the historic norm for postwar recoveries, and were buttressed by the largest stimulus package in U.S. history—larger than all previous postwar stimulus programs combined. Since this spending surge was financed entirely with debt, the stimulus impact should have been maximized as the Keynesian multiplier worked its miracles.<br />To further help the economy, the Fed initiated a massive monetary easing. The Fed purchased, or offset by purchasing other securities, more than 55% of all federal debt issued during 2010-13—far more than the 10% of government debt the Federal Reserve purchased during the entirety of World War II.</td>

      <td>Quantitative easing hoovers up bonds, leaving less collateral for eager borrowers.</td>
      <td>Dear Jerome Powell: End quantitative easing now. The Japanese tried QE in 2001, buying government debt, mortgage securities and even stocks. It didn’t work. The Federal Reserve has tried it four times since Lehman Brothers went belly up in 2008. QE doesn’t work and instead of keeping markets stable it creates instability.<br />The Fed supervises and regulates U.S. banks. But traditional banking (think Mr. Potter from “It’s a Wonderful Life”) represents only about 15% of all lending, maybe less. The rest is the mysterious-sounding shadow banking system based on securities lending and other credit products, including repurchase agreements—the repo market.<br />In repo, broker-dealers, hedge funds and banks construct short-term transactions. You put up collateral—Treasury bills or sometimes less-pristine instruments—with an agreement to buy them back the next day or week for slightly more, and invest the proceeds in the interim. Jeffrey Snider, head of research at Alhambra Investments, calls it a “reserve-less currency system.” This is how global supply chains are funded, to bring us cheap goods from  Walmart  or  Amazon .<br />Sometimes lenders repledge the collateral to other lenders and take out repo loans of their own. And the cycle goes on. It’s a little bit like hot potato, passing the collateral to the next guy. Known as rehypothecation, these transfers used to be done once or twice for each posted asset but are now sometimes done six to eight times, each time creating new money supply. Note: this is modern money creation—outside the purview of the Federal Reserve—and it’s huge.<br />When times are good, repos work fine: The agreements expire without problems and the collateral gets passed back down the chain smoothly. But eventually, iffy collateral sneaks into the system. That’s also fine, until markets hit an inevitable rough patch, like, say, March 2020. No one will take the junky stuff anymore, and everyone scrambles for good collateral. So there’s a mad dash, a brawl really, to buy Treasurys—like musical chairs with six to eight buyers eagerly eyeing one chair.</td>

      <td>There are many bad actors in the opioid crisis and the government is right to go after them. But your editorial “Scapegoating Walmart” (Dec. 30) is correct:  Walmart ’s  pharmacies are not among them. Our government is scapegoating and suing the private sector, when the most important driver of the crisis was the federal government’s indiscriminate financing of the underlying opioid prescriptions. Government subsidies for pain management and other medical uses of opioids may be valuable, but people are dying from nonmedical uses that shouldn’t be publicly financed.<br />A 2019 report by the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers shows that the share of opioid pills paid for by the government went from 17% to 60% through the initial phase of the epidemic, from 2001 to 2010, when prescriptions dominated misuse, and didn’t stop there. Out-of-pocket prices for prescription opioids declined by 81% during this period. Without government subsidies, it would have cost between $26,000 and $53,000 a year to buy the pills to maintain an opioid addiction out-of-pocket.<br />The large prescription-based crisis would have been infeasible without government funding. Innovation into illegal opioids, which lowered the “price of a high” through fentanyl, was profitable only because of the large demand already generated by the prescription crisis. The government would make greater strides toward limiting the crisis by looking inward, not only outward, for its causes.<br />Prof. Tomas J. Philipson<br />University of Chicago</td>

China’s military satellites, cyberwarfare capabilities, use of artificial intelligence and narrowing gap with U.S. firepower make it what the Pentagon calls a “near-peer” rival.<br />At one of a series of recent exercises, a few dozen Marines faded into long grass after touching down in two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, followed by Japanese soldiers arriving in two Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft. Their simulated mission: avoiding detection and recapturing a port on an island inside the range of much of the enemy’s missiles and artillery.<br />The exercise reflected a new emphasis on small, dispersed troop units and command centers, which are intended to be harder to locate and destroy. The simulation was one of the first to be directed from a command hub consisting of three armored vehicles that can be set up or moved in minutes and emit fewer traceable signals.<br />“We’re trying to get away from tents, from computer screens, because, one, it’s very stationary and, two, it has a huge electromagnetic signature,” said Lt.

      <td>It is easy to spot bubbles. Too easy: They seem to be almost everywhere, almost all the time. Worse still for those of us who try to spot excess, much of the stuff that was labeled frothy in recent years went on to make big money in 2020 for those who bought into it anyway.<br />The question for investors: Were the bubble calls just wrong? Or are we in a new era of wild speculation driven by cheap money that must inevitably come to an end?<br />I lean toward the latter. But the stunning performance of so many bubble stocks this past year shows that even if this turns out to be right eventually, there is plenty of scope to be horribly wrong in the meantime.<br />For one example, consider the bubble portfolio created in mid-2017 by Paul McNamara, an emerging-market fund manager at GAM. Featuring stocks and bonds labeled as bubbles by the financial  Twitter  community that year, it includes  Tesla ,   Netflix ,   Tencent ,  a bitcoin fund, Canadian apartments, London property and long-dated U.S., Japanese and Argentinian bonds. Only one—the Argentinian 100-year bond—is down since being selected, having lost almost all its value.<br />If you had spread $900 equally across the portfolio’s nine holdings at the end of June 2017, you would now have more than $2,950, more than double what you would have got from the S&P 500.

      <td>For all its contradictions, president’s trade battle with China could smooth way for incoming administration to do better</td>
      <td>At first glance, the Trump administration appears to have left President-elect Joe Biden with a strong hand to play in trade negotiations with China. But bringing things to a successful resolution will be challenging on multiple fronts.<br />Despite the so-called “phase one” trade agreement struck in January 2020, tariffs between the two nations remain elevated. U.S. levies on Chinese goods have gone from an average level of 3.1% in January 2018, before tensions kicked into high gear, to 19.3% now, according to an analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. That is down only marginally from 21% before the deal. China’s average tariffs have risen, too, from 8.0% before the trade war to 20.3% now.<br />At the same time, China is all but certain to miss its commitments to purchase a series of U.S. goods. By November, for instance, it had purchased only around two-thirds of the volume of agricultural products it committed to for the entire year, according to PIIE.<br />In theory, this should give Mr. Biden a strong negotiating position. He has already said he wouldn’t immediately lift the tariffs, which should prove more punishing to China than the U.S., as its economy generally depends more on exports. Yet the Chinese economy is currently performing strongly because the country curbed the spread of the coronavirus earlier and thanks to a pandemic-triggered surge in global demand for its exports, from face masks to videogame consoles. Indeed, in November China’s trade surplus hit a new monthly high in dollar terms of $75 billion.<br />The most obvious way for the U.S. to add pressure would be to bring allies like Japan and Europe onto its side. Mr. Biden has pledged to do just this, but what exactly these allies are prepared and able to do remains unclear, said PIIE Senior Fellow Chad Bown. The EU, for instance, lacks the strong executive powers that Trump employed to set tariff levels, Mr. Bown says. The investment deal that China and the EU just agreed to in principle raises further doubts as to the Europeans’ willingness to confront Beijing.</td>

The use of what are called blank-check companies, which go public with no assets and then merge with private companies, surged in 2020, raising a record $82.1 billion in 2020, up from $13.5 billion in 2019, according to Dealogic.<br />Startups that went public through SPACs, including many nascent companies with no revenue, have said they were attracted to the relative speed and certainty of the process, which can be completed months faster than some IPOs.<br />But as the tool gains favor, there are concerns about the regulatory differences between the two modes of going public. The prospect of wooing retail traders through media and inherently speculative projections brings heightened risk to stock-market investors, according to some venture capitalists and corporate-governance experts.</td>

Investors who don’t understand how it all fits together might one day find themselves scrambling for shelter.<br />Originators are probably the most familiar players to investors. They sit at the front of the process, and in many cases deal directly with borrowers. But for a mortgage with typical terms and size, they are usually not the player that ultimately owns the loan.<br />One major reason is the U.S. housing market’s unique system of taxpayer support, via the government-sponsored enterprises.  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  buy loans from originators, guarantee them and resell them to investors as agency mortgage securities. So in turn, many originators’ economics are ultimately driven by the volume of loans they produce and sell via Fannie or Freddie. This business model also avoids lending risk and requires less capital, making it appealing to investors.</td>

      <td>Lawmakers reconvene with smaller Democratic majority and absences expected because of coronavirus</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) is poised to win her fourth term as House speaker on Sunday, but a narrower Democratic majority and uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic will make for little wiggle room.<br />Mrs. Pelosi has spent time in recent weeks shoring up support among Democrats to be able to carry a majority of those present and voting by name, as every vote will matter for the speakership as Congress convenes for its new session.<br />Democrats expect to have 222 seats to Republicans’ 211. One race in New York is still in dispute, and a seat in Louisiana will be vacant because Republican Rep.-elect Luke Letlow died on Tuesday from complications of Covid-19. Two other Republican lawmakers are expected to be absent because they have tested positive for Covid-19. It isn’t known if any Democrats will miss the vote.<br />“My opponent is Covid,” Mrs. Pelosi said on a call last week with Democrats discussing the speakership, according to a person on the call. To the public, she has asserted a confident position, saying last week she definitely expects to have a majority present and that she isn’t worried about getting re-elected.<br />Rather than assemble at once, House lawmakers will enter the chamber in groups on Sunday to enforce social distancing, which is expected to drag out a generally fast process into one that lasts several hours. First, a roll call will determine who is present. Then, lawmakers will select the speaker of the House. After that, members will take the oath of office in groups.</td>

      <td>Surging demand in the West and port delays drive up costs for companies that have fueled the country’s economic recovery</td>
      <td>HONG KONG—A logjam in the global shipping industry is testing the resilience of China’s exporters, who have driven the country’s economic recovery by churning out goods to meet surging global demand during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />That demand in recent months has outpaced the capacity of a global shipping industry that has been slowed by pandemic safety measures. Chinese exporters have been paying sharply higher rates and struggling to find containers for their goods.<br />Chen Yang, who runs a textile trading unit at a state-owned enterprise in the southern city of Hefei, said the business, which mostly exports to the U.S., has weathered the pandemic and the China-U.S. trade war, but he expects to lose money this year in part because of a sharp rise in shipping costs.<br />A 40-foot container arriving at the port of Charleston, S.C., in December cost Mr. Yang around $7,500, up from $2,700 in April, he said. He also has to book space on the vessel at least 20 days in advance, more than double the usual time.<br /></td>

      <td>Investors ended one of Wall Street’s wildest years on record by piling into everything from bitcoin to emerging markets, raising expectations that a powerful economic comeback will fuel even more gains.<br />The vast climb known as the “everything rally” accelerated late in the year, sending the S&P 500 to its 33rd record of 2020 last week. Following an early-year collapse, the broad U.S. equity gauge, global stocks and an index of raw materials each rose at least 35% from the end of March through the end of the year, only the third time in figures going back five decades that all of those investments have climbed so much in such a short time, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Both of the previous nine-month periods were in 2009 exiting the financial crisis.<br />The S&P 500 ended the year up 68% from its March lows, after losing more than one-third of its value in about a month. Government bond yields, which fall as prices rise, remain near all-time lows. Meanwhile, corporate bond yields also dropped after early-year turmoil. That means many bond investors ended the year with gains. And U.S. crude-oil prices are back near $50 a barrel after briefly dropping below $0 for the first time ever in April.<br />After the eye-popping rise during a global pandemic highlighted confidence that central banks and governments would prop up the world economy, many investors now expect the delivery of vaccines to buoy markets.<br />Gauges of sentiment from organizations including the American Association of Individual Investors show bearishness at multiyear lows. Meanwhile, tens of billions of dollars have recently plowed into exchange-traded and mutual funds that track stocks. Both of those trends have preceded past pullbacks, signaling excessive optimism to some cautious investors. Some are drawing parallels to the outsize gains late in 2017 and early 2018, before trade tensions and higher interest rates roiled markets.</td>

      <td>Headed into 2021, the U.S. faces a surge in coronavirus cases, new restrictions on business, cautious holiday shopping and slowing economic growth. Forecasters anticipate that the Labor Department’s December jobs report, due to be released Friday, will show the labor market closed the year on a weak footing.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect to see employers added 68,000 new jobs in December, down from 245,000 a month earlier. That would mark the slowest month of the labor market’s recovery since May.<br />As the Covid-19 pandemic drags into another year, however, economists see several reasons for optimism.<br />First, the recently enacted pandemic-relief legislative package will pump $900 billion into the economy in coming months.<br />Second, with much of the services sector hobbled by the pandemic, Americans have been saving an unusually high share of their income since spring, when the pandemic first prompted widespread restrictions on business activities. The U.S. personal saving rate was 12.9% in November, down from 33.7% in April but still well above the 7.5% rate a year earlier. Many households will be able to draw on those reserves to boost spending once coronavirus-related restrictions ease and vaccinations embolden people to venture out more, according to economists.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Eleven current and incoming Republican senators said they would vote to reject the Electoral College votes of some states on Wednesday as not “lawfully certified” unless Congress appoints a commission to conduct an emergency, 10-day audit of the election results.<br />Although none of the challenges are expected to succeed, they could slow down the process and give President Trump’s allies a high-profile chance to demonstrate their loyalty to him. The move also highlights deepening divisions within the Republican Party over whether to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election as legitimate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and other Senate GOP leaders have congratulated Democrat President-elect Joe Biden and have urged their colleagues not to join in efforts to dispute the outcome.<br />The GOP senators who signed onto the effort are Ted Cruz of Texas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Mike Braun of Indiana. It was also joined by Senators-elect Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.<br />By law, Congress must hold a joint session on Jan. 6 to ratify Mr. Biden’s 306-232 Electoral College win. Objections from some Republican senators and House members are expected to force debate and votes in both chambers of Congress. Majorities in both the House and Senate would have to agree for the challenge to be successful, an extremely unlikely prospect given that Democrats control the House.<br />In a statement released Saturday, the senators and senators-elect said the commission was needed because the 2020 presidential election was rife with “unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities.”</td>

Tesla said it produced 509,737 vehicles last year.<br />The company’s resilience during the pandemic that has reduced road travel and damped auto sales globally has fueled investor exuberance for the electric-car maker. Its stock soared more than 700% last year.<br />Chief Executive Elon Musk, via Twitter, hailed the figures as a “major milestone,” adding that during the early days of Tesla he wasn’t certain the company would make it—a sentiment he has previously expressed.<br />Tesla in the coming months faces a difficult task as it looks to introduce additional vehicle models and open new factories in Germany and Texas as part of Mr. Musk’s growth ambitions.</td>

But investors and analysts say bookings will take years to rise back to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, the industry faces growing financial stress as property owners struggle to pay their mortgage bills, wages and other expenses.<br />Despite the record drop in bookings, many hotels have been able to stay open thanks to debt relief from banks and temporary government aid like the Paycheck Protection Program. Now some lenders are starting to lose patience, brokers and investors say, which could lead to an increase in foreclosures and distressed-property sales in the first half of 2021.<br />For hotel owners, “it’s all about survival,” said Greig Taylor, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners LLP.</td>

      <td>History suggests that the president-elect should insist on strong decision-making processes and deal firmly with staff misbehavior</td>
      <td>As President-elect Joe Biden builds his administration, he has drawn on his long experience in national politics, filling key positions with White House veterans and a sprinkling of newcomers. But the success of Mr. Biden’s administration will depend not just on who gets big jobs but on the thoughtful management of his team. The new president needs a staff and cabinet that are cohesive in debate and unified in action.<br />Administration infighting is inevitable, but it needn’t be paralyzing. Mr. Biden’s goal should be to manage conflict, not to eliminate it. History points to three primary levers at his disposal: recognizing and managing ideological conflict, maintaining a strong decision-making process and dealing firmly with staff and cabinet misbehavior.<br />The most frequent White House divisions are along ideological lines. President Ronald Reagan’s administration was plagued by clashes between moderates, led by White House chief of staff James A. Baker, and committed conservatives, led by counselor Edwin Meese. Mr. Baker, in particular, was a master leaker and infighter. Still, when Reagan chose Mr. Baker over Mr. Meese as chief of staff, he directed Mr. Baker to “make it right with Ed.” The two joined with deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver to form the “troika” that ran the early Reagan White House.<br />The lack of trust among the troika members wound up leaving them joined at the hip, reluctant to let each other meet privately with Reagan for fear that the others might use facetime with the president to their advantage. This need to stick together applied even after Reagan was shot in 1981. When the troika visited his hospital bed together, Reagan joked, “I should’ve known I wasn’t going to avoid a staff meeting.” Yet getting the perspective of the two main competing ideologies within the GOP helped Reagan to hold on to both sides.<br />President Bill Clinton also used his ideologically divided staff to his advantage. His team initially pulled his administration leftward with an unsuccessful health care initiative, a tax hike and a push to end the Pentagon’s ban on gay people serving in the military. The liberal drift contributed to the Democrats’ loss of both houses of Congress in 1994. Smarting, Mr. Clinton brought in a secret adviser—whom he code-named “Charlie”—to help moderate his administration. This adviser’s tactics and mysterious identity unnerved liberal White House staffers like George Stephanopoulos and Harold Ickes, who found that progressive decisions made by day would shift to the right overnight.</td>

      <td>Urban guys are wearing technical outdoor gear from brands like Patagonia, And Wander and the North Face. They look like they could summit Everest—but they’re probably just running to Starbucks.</td>
      <td>GORPCORE, named for the trail-mix acronym that’s short for “good ol’ raisins and peanuts,” represents the convergence of outdoorsy gear and more quotidian men’s fashion. Think of the technical parkas and backpacks you’d wear while nibbling on nuts and dried fruit during a hike up a mountain. Now transfer that same gear to city streets, maybe paired with your prosaic sneakers.<br />The term “gorpcore”—coined by New York Magazine’s style site the Cut in 2017—has been bubbling up in men’s fashion for a few years. It emerged as an outdoor-specific offshoot of the 2010s’ normcore trend, which recontextualized humble, pragmatic clothes as lust-worthy fashion. The defining gorpian image might be a photo of taciturn singer Frank Ocean trekking to a Paris fashion show in 2019 wearing a fitted, clementine-orange jacket by 159-year-old Swiss mountaineering brand Mammut and a greenish beanie from 32-year-old North Vancouver outdoor brand Arc’teryx, with bluejeans and hiking boots. He looks as if he’s wandered off the Pacific Crest Trail and into the Tuileries.<br />That Mr. Ocean wore Arc’teryx and Mammut during fashion week and not, say, Prada is telling. Gorpcore is not about designer labels cynically co-opting the outdoor look, creating fragile mountaineering boots that look the part but would falter on the trail. It’s about a deep appreciation of genuine, all-weather brands stretching from Japan’s And Wander to California’s Patagonia.<br />Those two brands represent two distinct classes of gorpcore. And Wander, a Tokyo-based label founded in 2011, is one of several relatively new brands that sell high-design gear that could nevertheless withstand a toe-tingling winter squall. Think fleeces with reflective details and sturdy pocket-packed poly pants. Also in this category: fellow Japanese labels Snow Peak and F/CE, the Swedish cold-weather brand Houdini, and Gyakusou, a  Nike  offshoot focused on running garb.<br />The other class of gorpcore brands—including REI, Marmot and Patagonia—are long-established stalwarts traditionally valued for placing function over design. Freshly coveted by young gorpcore fanatics, this group includes seasoned global brands like Helly Hansen (Norway) and Goldwin (Japan), and cultier, trail-rooted labels such as Gramicci, Manastash and La Sportiva.</td>

Many of these people said they would prefer remote work all five days of the workweek.<br />Another set of 10,000 employees surveyed by the Becker Friedman Institute for Economics at the University of Chicago say they felt the work-from-home situation was either just as productive or more so than the office.

      <td>Can China’s hybrid state-capitalist economy learn to worship—or at least genuflect a bit deeper—at the altar of efficiency? As relations with wealthier, technologically advanced countries deteriorate, that is probably the most crucial economic question of the 2020s.<br />There are signs of real progress, much of it ironically driven by foreign pressure and the fear of stagnation as links with more open economies erode. But the enduring power of Chinese state-owned companies and their pull over the financial sector still represent huge vulnerabilities.<br />One clear and underappreciated example of progress is in intellectual property. Rhetoric from Washington notwithstanding, a majority of U.S. companies actually say IP protection in China is getting better, albeit from a low base, according to an American Chamber of Commerce survey this summer. Since 2014, China has set up a system of specialized IP courts and litigation has exploded, with over 481,000 IP cases in 2019, up nearly 50% from 2018.<br />New bankruptcy courts are also helping dispatch struggling companies more quickly, which could help address China’s chronic problem with “zombie” companies and free up scarce resources. The average length of bankruptcy cases in China is high: around 1.6 years on average over the past decade, or 60% longer than in the U.S., according to a recent National Bureau of Economic Research working paper.<br />But cases handled by the special courts—now roughly half of total bankruptcies, up from a negligible percentage in 2011—proceed about 35% more quickly than those in regular civil courts. Bankruptcy cases have also skyrocketed in numerical terms, rising from less than 5,000 in 2015 to nearly 19,000 in 2018 according to the Supreme People’s Court of China.</td>

We need every day to speed up and reach more people,” Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a news conference Thursday.<br />So far, the city has administered a fraction of the vaccines it has received since being granted authorization in mid-December, according to city data. As of Dec. 31, the city has administered 88,410 doses of the more than 430,000 it has received, according to city data. The priority has been among health-care workers, and most vaccine doses have been given at local hospitals and nursing homes, officials said.</td>

      <td>The sprawling SolarWinds hack by suspected Russian state-backed hackers is the latest sign of Moscow’s growing resolve and improving technical ability to cause disruption and conduct espionage at a global scale in cyberspace.<br />The hack, which compromised parts of the U.S. government as well as tech companies, a hospital and a university, adds to a string of increasingly sophisticated and ever more brazen online intrusions, demonstrating how cyber operations have become a key plank in Russia’s confrontation with the West, analysts and officials say.<br />Moscow’s relations with the West continue to sour, and the Kremlin sees the cyber operations as a cheap and effective way to achieve its geopolitical goals, analysts say. Russia, they say, is therefore unlikely to back off from such tactics, even while facing U.S. sanctions or countermeasures.<br />“For a country that already perceives itself as being in conflict with the West practically in every domain except open military clashes, there is no incentive to leave any field that can offer an advantage,” said Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at Chatham House think tank.<br />The scope of Russia’s cyber operations has grown in tandem with Moscow’s global ambitions: from cyberattacks on neighboring Estonia in 2007 to election interference in the U.S. and France a decade later, to SolarWinds, seen as one of the worst known hacks of federal computer systems.</td>

      <td><br />The eurozone has always had a fundamental weakness compared with the U.S. when dealing with financial and economic crises: While its 19 countries share a currency and interest-rate policy, they have no common tax-raising or spending power.<br />In 2020, the European Union took a big step toward correcting that deficiency by starting to issue bonds on behalf of all member countries, known as common bonds. Beginning in 2021, some common bonds will be repaid through taxes raised by the EU itself.<br />This fiscal role for the EU is meant to be a one-off, but policy made in the teeth of a crisis—in this case the coronavirus pandemic—often sticks. Many investors and analysts say that a central ability to make taxation and spending decisions at the EU level will become permanent going forward.<br />Europe’s leaders signed two support packages to help the 19 eurozone members and eight other countries that don’t use the euro cope with the Covid-19 crisis. Almost €40 billion, equivalent to almost $49 billion, of bonds were sold in 2020, and another €210 billion of bonds are expected to be sold in 2021, according to Pictet Wealth Management. Total funding from bond sales for the packages is expected to total €850 billion.</td>

      <td>In the first exhibit to focus on the artist’s portraits on paper, over 100 works capture the progression of time in the visages of the painter and four other frequent subjects.</td>
      <td>New York<br />For anyone seeking refuge from pandemics and politics, nothing could be more healthful than “David Hockney: Drawing From Life” at the Morgan Library & Museum (through May 30). A show intimate and expansive, it makes the polished parquet floors and high ceilings of the galleries glow with warmth and love. Originating at Britain’s National Portrait Gallery, it is also the first exhibit to focus on Mr. Hockney’s portraits on paper.<br />Mr. Hockney is one of the few modern artists (along with Calder and Matisse) guaranteed to convey unabated pleasure. Matisse famously said he wanted to make “an art of balance, of purity and serenity…a soothing, calming influence on the mind, something like a good armchair which provides relaxation from physical fatigue.” Calder’s mobiles, his playful circus of light-as-air objects in three dimensions, bring smiles to adults and children alike.<br />For his part, Mr. Hockney fills his pictures with clarity imbued with charity that anyone can understand. Born in 1937, he is also, perhaps, the last in a line of Old Masters who have profited from academic training. That he honors tradition and simultaneously reinvents it (and himself) testifies to his energetic abundance.<br />Like Rembrandt and Picasso, both of whom are kindly overseeing presences here (as is Ingres, superb draftsman, master of the line), Mr. Hockney has been constantly self-revising and experimental. From pencil, pen and ink, charcoal, crayon, watercolor and gouache, through etching, lithography, photography and collage, to pictures on iPhone and iPad, there is practically no medium uncongenial to his talent.</td>

      <td>Effort on Jan. 6 to get House, Senate to overturn some states’ election results could force debate and votes</td>
      <td>Congress is set to hold a joint session Wednesday to ratify Democrat President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College win in the November election, in a final step ahead of his Jan. 20 inauguration. Some Republicans plan to raise challenges to some of the states’ results, alleging election irregularities. Their objections could force debate and votes in both chambers of Congress.<br />None of the challenges are expected to succeed, but they could slow down the process, and they give Trump allies a high-profile chance to formally challenge the election results. Here are some questions and answers about how events will play out.<br />The law specifies that Congress is to convene at 1 p.m. Jan. 6 for a joint meeting to officially count and validate the 538 electoral votes that have been certified by the 50 states and District of Columbia.<br />Under the process, Vice President Mike Pence, acting in his constitutional role as the president of the Senate, opens up all the certificates reflecting the vote tallies sent by the states. He hands them to “tellers,” who are people appointed from the House and the Senate to read the ballots and verify the results. The tellers then read the states’ certificates in alphabetical order, starting with Alabama and ending with Wyoming, stating that the certificate from each state “seems to be regular in form and authentic.” Mr. Pence has the power to recognize any lawmaker who objects.<br />Any lawmaker can challenge a state’s Electoral College votes, but it takes one member of the House and one senator to formally object to a state’s result and bring the challenge to a vote by lawmakers. The objection must be in writing.</td>

      <td>With many parents working from home and home schooling their children, an hourlong escape to the gym, even a home gym, is a luxury. If you’re finding it hard to make time for your workout, try including your kids.<br />“It’s important for your kids, no matter their age, to see you make movement a priority,” says Samantha Campbell, owner of Deep Relief Peak Performance Athletic Training Center in Haiku, Hawaii, on the island of Maui. “It could be as simple as a family walk before or after dinner.”<br />Ms. Campbell says she found it easier to carve out time for workouts when her daughter, Kiana Turpin, was younger. “I could place her in one spot while I worked out or hold her and do lunges or squats,” she says. “Now that she is 2 ½ years old, she can walk and talk and has her own ideas of what she wants to do.”<br />Rather than ditch her workout, Ms. Campbell creates ways to involve her daughter, and husband, Neil Turpin, which might be as simple as having her daughter call out the color of the cup Ms. Campbell and Mr. Turpin will perform a toe tap on.<br />With older children, Ms. Campbell suggests turning exercise into play. She often gamifies workouts for her training programs specifically designed for kids ages 5 to 13. “The more competitive you make an activity, the more excited kids are to do it,” she says. And both adults and kids tend to stick with workouts that feel fun. Here, Ms. Campbell shares six ideas for exercises that will challenge your core strength, reaction time, agility and cardio while getting the whole family involved.</td>

Mr. Gibbs, a 31-year Yum veteran who became chief executive officer a year ago, went from advancing the company’s expansion strategy to contending with thousands of closed restaurants.<br />Many large fast-food companies have since largely rebounded from the early pandemic shutdowns, and Yum’s U.S. comparable sales rose in the third quarter from a year ago. But Mr. Gibbs says he is rethinking how Yum—which has upward of 50,000 restaurants, more than any other fast-food chain—can serve and deliver more to-go food longer term.<br />He is plotting a future where ordering fried chicken ahead online is routine, and Pizza Hut customers can get their orders placed in their trunks without having to enter a restaurant.<br />Meanwhile, hundreds of its U.S. Pizza Hut locations that mostly did dine-in business have closed permanently.</td>

All that was left was for No. 2 Clemson to reach the final as well, setting up another rematch of teams that have already squared off in three of the last five title games.<br />But in an appropriate twist for this chaotic pandemic season, the Crimson Tide’s opponent will be No. 3 Ohio State. The Buckeyes delivered a stunning 49-28 knockout over the Tigers on the back of a big night by Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields, who threw six touchdown passes and bested Clemson superstar Trevor Lawrence, the presumed No. 1 pick in the next NFL draft.<br />Ohio State, a seven-point underdog in the Sugar Bowl, was playing without several starters due to coronavirus contact tracing. Yet the Buckeyes picked apart Clemson’s vaunted defense, avenging Ohio State’s bitter semifinal loss to Clemson a year ago in a game marked by controversial calls.<br />“It didn’t sit well in our mouth when we lost that game,” said Ohio State Coach Ryan Day of the 2019 Fiest Bowl. “So to come out and win the way we did [tonight], it was big.”<br />Alabama earlier earned its fifth trip to the national championship in six years by steamrolling No. 4 Notre Dame 31-14 in the Rose Bowl, which this year was relocated to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, from its namesake home in Pasadena, Calif., due to rising Covid-19 infection rates in Southern California.</td>

Louie Gohmert and several Arizona Republicans who unsuccessfully ran to be presidential electors—didn’t have standing to file the case.<br />The New Year’s Day order was the latest of dozens of state and federal court decisions rejecting efforts by President Trump and his allies to overturn the Nov. 3 presidential election, which Mr. Biden won with 306 electoral votes over Mr. Trump’s 232. Mr. Biden also defeated Mr. Trump in the nationwide popular vote, 81 million to 74 million.<br />Congress is to meet on Jan. 6 in a ceremonial session where electoral votes will be counted and the presidential election formally concluded.<br />Mr. Gohmert, who is from Texas, and the Arizona Republicans sued Mr. Pence in an effort to strike down the Electoral Count Act, an 1887 law that prescribes congressional procedures for finalizing presidential elections. Rather than perform the ceremonial role of opening electoral certificates from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as the law directs, the vice president, as president of the Senate, held the sole power to decide which votes to count, the lawsuit argued.</td>

      <td>No longer a drab exercise in dieting or self-denial, salads have become a sharp, spicy reflection of the best in culinary trends</td>
      <td>As 2021 begins, the dish I find myself craving the most, slightly to my surprise, is salad. The version I’ve been making most often lately is a concoction of raw Brussels sprouts, shredded finely and mixed with a Vietnamese-inspired dressing of garlic, mint leaves, chillies, fish sauce, rice vinegar, lime juice and cashew nuts. I don’t eat this salad because it is healthy—though it undoubtedly is—but because it wakes up my taste buds quicker than a double espresso. With its brightness and crunch, it tastes as close as I can get to a fresh start.<br />The rules of salad have changed. To be a salad eater is no longer an act of dieting or denial. Now you can eat salad because you want to eat it. The word no longer needs to bring to mind a flavorless bowl of cold tomatoes and watery lettuce. Rather, it could be any combination of crisp and sharp ingredients that you happen to find in your refrigerator and feel like having with dinner. A carefully made salad, as food writer Nigella Lawson writes in her new cookbook “Cook, Eat, Repeat,” will lift the spirits and “add poetry to the prose of everyday life.”<br />Growing up in Britain, as Ms. Lawson also did, I often looked to the U.S. for salads that were fuller and more generous than ours, which might consist of a couple of disks of undressed cucumber with some raw onion and vinegary beetroot. I dreamed of America’s Caesar and Cobb salads, with their flavorful dressings and lavish scatterings of croutons.<br />There have been many ages of salad at the American table. Perhaps no other dish has undergone so many transformations over the decades. Salads hold up a mirror to the changing culinary obsessions of the times, from the curious gelatin-based concoctions of the 1940s to the baked goat cheese and frisée salads of the 1980s to the raw kale of the 2010s. When salade Niçoise became fashionable in the 1960s, it reflected the new popularity of foreign travel to Europe. This mixture of tuna and black olives and green beans seemed deeply sophisticated compared with the old deli staple of tuna salad made with mayonnaise and chopped celery.<br />It can be hard to remember how the vast choice of salad stuff now compares with a few decades ago. Take radicchio. These bitter purple-and-white leaves were almost unheard of among American cooks until the mid-1970s, when in the space of six months it seemed that every expensive restaurant in New York added radicchio to its menu, starting with Le Cirque.</td>

      <td>From computers and money to relations with China, 1971 changed the world in many ways.</td>
      <td>Fifty years ago, America entered a magical year. Any year could hold moments of great significance, but 1971 stands out. After a decade of upheaval, the country was seeking a new start. These events launched it.<br />• Henry Kissinger’s secret trip to China. In the late 1960s, President Nixon and Mr. Kissinger began thinking that establishing diplomatic relations with China would serve as counterweight to tensions with Moscow. Nixon made some encouraging but vague statements, and Mr. Kissinger tried communicating through French and Pakistani emissaries with little progress.<br />Many believed the sticking point was U.S. recognition of Taiwan and the “two Chinas” policy. But declassified documents released by the National Archives in 2001 revealed that China was eager for dialogue. As historian William Burr observed, while many have written about America’s intention to play the China card, “it is the rare policymaker who understands that the United States may also be the object of other nations’ card playing.”<br />Mr. Kissinger’s secret July trip to Beijing triggered the greatest shift in global politics since the end of World War II. It paved the way for Nixon to meet Mao Zedong the following year and kicked off 50 years of diplomacy, trade and travel between China and the U.S. Recent tensions only confirm the complex motivations that launched the relationship. The card playing continues.<br />• The arrival of phone competition. With little fanfare, the Federal Communications Commission issued an opaque decision that marked the first blow to  AT&T ’s  monopoly in long-distance and business telephone service. The beneficiary was MCI, a tiny company that was about to change the communications world by introducing competition. Following the FCC decision, the company’s visionary leader William McGowan raised $110 million—then one of the largest startup funding rounds—to construct a new national telephone network that would end extravagant prices for long-distance calls. He fought through nearly a decade of litigation until the landmark 1980 ruling that broke up AT&T and gave MCI access to switched network connections required for competition.</td>

      <td>Anthony Fauci is being clobbered after admitting to the  New York Times  that he publicly lowballed his estimate of the Covid-19 herd immunity threshold, but it’s ludicrously late in the day to discover that “messaging” has been going on.<br />Dr. Fauci’s early pooh-poohing of masks to preserve supply for medical personnel at least was defensible for the larger good. Not until summer did he admit the test-and-trace miracle cure was no such thing given the realities of asymptomatic spread. To this day, test-and-trace serves as the magic X in every pundit piece, allowing the author to claim that our failing mommy and daddy (a k a government) let us down by not enacting this simple solution.<br />Of course it’s gibberish: 40% of Covid cases are asymptomatic; 80% of symptomatic cases are mild and indistinguishable from cold or flu so the sufferer has little reason to seek testing. Our borders are porous. So far we have tested only about 80% of Americans even once. We’d have to test 330 million every few days to catch a useful percentage of Covid cases while they’re still infectious. Add contact tracing and the numbers are clearly impossible. But because the strategy was useful in a South Korean context our politicians go through the motions here.<br />Another messaging snafu poked through last summer. CDC’s Robert Redfield admitted our testing might be catching only 10% of cases—i.e., the circus that fills hours of media airtime is doing nothing to control the epidemic or even measure it.<br />Official lying about things large and small has been a staple of Covid politics: the letters to college students threatening them with arrest if they don’t quarantine, the interstate travel “bans” that were never enforced, the death counts that swept up anybody who died of any cause while infected with Covid.</td>

      <td>Hartford, Conn.<br />The Hartford Courant has had a presence in Connecticut’s capital city for 250 years. Last month the paper’s owners announced that its newsroom would close for good. The Courant will continue to publish, but its reporters and editors will no longer work the phones in its downtown offices. Some journalists may consider the shift to remote work a relief. Hartford is the state’s most dangerous city and, by some measures, among the most dangerous cities in the country.<br />Once famous as the “insurance capital of the world,” Hartford has been in decline for 30 years. In the 1990s, Hartford’s population hemorrhage made national news. Today it is smaller still, less than 70% of what it was in 1950. Hartford’s poverty rate is one of the highest in the nation. The city is falling apart.<br />Even before the pandemic, WalletHub.com ranked Hartford 46th among state capitals in affordability, economic well-being, education, health and quality of life. The past nine months are unlikely to have improved that ranking. The city spends more than $400 million annually on education ($17,260 per student) yet nearly 30% of its students don’t graduate high school on time. Only 18% of students in grades 3 through 8 test at age-appropriate levels in math, and 25% do so in reading.<br />Hartford has been governed almost exclusively by Democrats since 1948. The city’s sole Republican mayor during that time, Antonina Uccello, left office in 1971. Earlier this year Mayor Luke Bronin, 41, embraced the progressive mantra to “defund the police” and reduced the city’s public-safety budget by $2 million, or 6%. The spike in gun violence that followed required Mr. Bronin to ask Gov. Ned Lamont, also a Democrat, to send in the Connecticut State Police. There were more than 200 shootings in the city through the first 11 months of the year—making it Hartford’s most violent year in at least a decade. What does Mr. Bronin think is responsible? A Connecticut Public Radio report put it bluntly: “The mayor blames the explosion of gun violence in his city on COVID-19.”</td>

In 2020, the President is on board, and party leaders are too quiet out of cowardice. It’s not that partisans of one side or another are more prone to accept conspiratorial claims. It’s that in 2020 political “leaders” have abdicated their responsibility to show leadership and check such tendencies within their tribe.</td>

      <td>Bipartisan vote came after president objected to certain measures including renaming bases and lack of changes to online content laws</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Senate voted to override President Trump’s veto of a $740.5 billion defense bill, with many Republicans joining Democrats to deliver a rebuke to Mr. Trump in the final days of his presidency and for the first time pass into law legislation he had blocked.<br />The National Defense Authorization Act is an annual measure that secures hazard-pay raises for troops and authorizes funds for aircraft, ships, nuclear weapons, and other national-security programs. Mr. Trump had threatened to veto this year’s bill before it passed Congress, but lawmakers had moved forward anyway, approving it with wide majorities.<br />Mr. Trump has objected to several provisions in this year’s NDAA. He has criticized it for including measures that would strip military bases of names honoring Confederate military leaders and regulate troop withdrawals he has sought in Afghanistan and Germany. The White House also sought to repeal legal immunity social-media companies enjoy for users’ content as part of the bill, a push that lawmakers rebuffed.<br />The Senate voted 81-13 to override the veto, exceeding the two-thirds supermajority required. The action follows the House’s 322-87 override on Monday, and the bill now becomes law.<br />“Our Republican Senate just missed the opportunity to get rid of Section 230, which gives unlimited power to Big Tech companies. Pathetic!!!” Mr. Trump tweeted Friday. The legal immunities for social-media companies are enshrined in section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.</td>

      <td>BAURU, Brazil—In its 124-year history, this midsize, mostly white city in Brazil’s prosperous farming belt had never had an Afro-Brazilian as mayor. Until now.<br />The inauguration Friday of Suéllen Rosim, 32 years old, comes as thousands of Black and mixed-race politicians from across the political spectrum take office in municipal governments across Brazil in what is being hailed as a victory for people of color and a big step against racism in Latin America’s biggest country.<br />A growing appreciation of Brazil’s African heritage and the rising profile of influential Black politicians have fueled the shift. Brazil has the biggest Black or mixed-race population of any country outside Africa, nearly 120 million—more than half the population—but only 4% of politicians in Congress are Black.<br />A Supreme Court ruling in October that forced parties to allocate a percentage of their state-provided campaign funds to Black and mixed-race candidates also elevated politicians of color and encouraged more to identify as such.<br />“We’re showing that it’s possible—it’s possible to be a woman, to be Black, and to be a mayor, a state governor or even president,” said Ms. Rosim, a gospel singer and former television news anchor in this city of 380,000 people.</td>

Frank McKenzie, said Wednesday.<br />Calls from Iranian-backed militia groups for violence against Americans have increased in the run-up to Jan. 3, the day last year that Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani and an Iraqi paramilitary commander with him were killed as they left Baghdad airport.<br />On Thursday, a pro-Iranian Iraqi news group on the messaging service Telegram published a picture of the U.S. Embassy captioned: “Remember always I can see what you are doing.”<br />The U.S. strike that killed Gen. Soleimani, and an Iranian counterstrike against U.S. forces with ballistic missiles, raised fears of open warfare in the Middle East. Tensions gradually eased, but Washington and Tehran remain at odds over Iran’s nuclear program and its support for foreign militias.</td>

Read previous columns here.<br />It all started with a bad hair day.<br />On the morning of April 11, Amy Watson, a preschool teacher in Portland, Ore., went to get tested for Covid-19 at a drive-up site after suffering a chronic fever. She hadn’t washed her hair, so she threw on a trucker hat with a picture of a squirrel on it, snapping a selfie to share on social media.<br />Two days later, her test came back positive. Later that month, after connecting with others who had contracted Covid and were still experiencing a range of chronic symptoms, she decided to set up a support group on  Facebook .  “I was sitting in my living room, and that hat I wore in the picture was on the coffee table,” Ms. Watson told me. The trucker hat got her thinking of long-haul trucking, inspiring her to name the Facebook group “Long Haul Covid Fighters.”<br />As the group kept growing, members began calling each other “long-haulers.” People gravitated toward the term, Ms. Watson recalls, because “it was validating as a group of patients to have a name given to what we were experiencing.”</td>

      <td>There’s an NFL rule that says the winner of every division gets to make the playoffs. It doesn’t matter if that team happens to be more of a loser than a winner and is just slightly better than the other bad teams in the same division.<br />Which brings us to the bleak race to win the NFC East. One of three teams—the Washington Football Team, Dallas Cowboys or New York Giants—will be remembered as perhaps the worst division winner in NFL history. The others will live with the ignominy of failing to win an historically moribund division.<br />It’s a fitting lowlight to end a regular season that has been strange in so many ways because of the pandemic. There were games on all seven days of the week. The Denver Broncos played a game without a quarterback. The New England Patriots were bad. The Buffalo Bills were actually good.<br />The absurdity rolls into the season’s final weekend, which features unusual scenarios as teams vie to make a newly expanded playoffs that now include a seventh team in each conference. A team with a 6-10 record could win the NFC East. A team with an 11-5 record could miss the playoffs entirely in the AFC. A team with an 8-8 record could win a wild-card spot in the NFC.<br />There’s one other key factor in this playoff picture: the virus that has disrupted the entire country and NFL season. The Cleveland Browns, one of the AFC contenders, are actively battling an outbreak that forced the closure of their facility and has sidelined players and staff. New positives test results rolled in Wednesday and Thursday, casting doubt on the status of their critical game.</td>

      <td>Destination spas are positioning themselves as refuges during the pandemic—moving treatments outside and getting creative with their stress-busting cures. ‘Eye hug,’ anyone?</td>
      <td>NEVER MIND the Sweet Slumber massage or the Spiritual Warrior facial. The greatest relaxation Sarah Evans experienced during her October getaway to Miraval Berkshires spa in Lenox, Mass., involved hands-off treatments. These included opportunities to hurl hatchets at tree trunk targets or to enjoy a shamanic sound healing, where Ms. Evans, a New York City publicist and mother of three young children, lay on a yoga mat bathed in the vibrations of crystal singing bowls. Hands-on cures—the antithesis to social-distancing—may have lost their appeal during the pandemic but spas still tout their stress-busting activities, and some weary quarantiners are heeding their call.<br />Lynne McNees, president of the International Spa Association (ISPA), a trade group, said that it’s too early to gauge Covid-19’s impact on the $19-billion spa industry. But, she added, since most large destination spas reopened in June, demand has been steady, with individual visits rising even as groups like bridal parties have stayed away. Ms. Evans has already booked another spa break for this month, this time in the Hamptons. “It would be incredible to go sit on a beach somewhere, but I want to take care of myself,” she said. “Everything feels more intense right now.”<br />The isolation brought on by the coronavirus has created a secondary crisis. Reported symptoms of anxiety, depression and other disorders have more than tripled since 2019, according to a September study by the American Medical Association. With their ample open spaces, destination spas say they can help. Their activity calendars were packed with rituals focused on stress relief and spiritual well-being long before the term “coronavirus” entered our lexicons, and they’re now positioning themselves as points of refuge in the pandemic.<br />That spin has merit, said Dr. Stephanie Silvera, an epidemiologist and professor at Montclair State University, in New Jersey. Spa-based activities like rock-climbing and hiking boost health in multiple ways. “We know that stress has an impact on the immune system, and cardiovascular activities help calm you,” said Ms. Silvera. “So if you can do them outside, with spacing, there’s a lot of value and benefit.”<br />No evidence suggests that Covid-19 can spread in chlorinated pools. Saunas are a fairly safe bet, too, if heated to at least 158 degrees Fahrenheit, said Dr. Silvera. The virus cannot survive those temperatures. But Dr. Silvera cautioned that no magic scenario, whether outdoors or not, can entirely erase the risk of Covid-19. Masks, social distancing and strict sanitation remain important measures. “Imagine that each preventive behavior is a layer of Swiss cheese that has some holes, and when you layer them, those holes go away,” she said.</td>

      <td>A Cornish manor becomes a symbol of long-held illusions in a comic tale of aristocracy’s end.</td>
      <td>In a song of 1938, Noël Coward wrote: “The stately homes of England / How beautiful they stand, / To prove the upper classes / Have still the upper hand. / Though the fact that they have to be rebuilt / And frequently mortgaged to the hilt / Is inclined to take the gilt / Off the gingerbread . . .”<br />Hannah Rothschild’s new comic novel “House of Trelawney” is about an ancestral home in Cornwall where the gilt has definitely come off. Trelawney Castle, situated on a bluff overlooking the ocean, has belonged to the same noble family for 800 years. “The castle was their three-dimensional calling card, the physical embodiment of their wealth and influence,” writes Ms. Rothschild. “Each Earl added an extension until it was declared the grandest, if not the finest, stately home in the county of Cornwall.”<br />It sounds wonderful. It’s not. The novel opens in 2008, and the castle has fallen into “chaos and decrepitude.” The bungling and ineptitude of the last eight dissolute earls, “along with two world wars, the Wall Street Crash, three divorces and inheritance taxes” has eaten up the estate. There were once medieval oak woods, meadows and waterfalls on the 500,000 acres known as “Trelawneyshire.” Now ponds have silted up, hedges are bedraggled, and arches are covered with vines. Inside the castle, which has a room for each day of the year, empty squares discolor walls where great paintings once hung. In the rooms “the huge side tables were covered in a layer of dust and detritus, and a grand piano sat in a pool of water.” And the decay is accelerating: “Occasionally a great crash of avalanching plaster could be heard falling like a tree in a faraway wood.”<br />In 1988 the 24th Earl of Trelawney, now aged 85, handed the pile to his feckless son and heir, Kitto. His oldest and smartest child, Blaze, couldn’t inherit because she was female. Such were Britain’s archaic rules of primogeniture. With no funds left for its upkeep Kitto, like many an earl or duke before him, was forced to marry for money. Jane, his dowdy bride, possessed a fortune. But, inevitably, Jane’s money ran out. So did the heating and hot water. Now she is martyr to the cause, the house “skivvy,” feeding her aging parents-in-law and three teenage children cut-price mince (ground beef). She delivers pots of hot water to the freezing elderly earl and countess who reside upstairs in a fantasy world peopled with imaginary housemaids and butlers. They still change into formal clothes (now rather shabby) for dinner.<br />Meanwhile, in London, the estranged Blaze is living in a different world. There are no drip-filled buckets or creeping mold in the modern white-and-beige apartment, complete with four-person Jacuzzi, she has bought near Tower Bridge. A financial wizard, Blaze is a senior partner at the highly successful firm of Kerkyra Capital, where she has been riding out the turbulence of the 2008 crash. Her life and Jane’s are reconnected when a long-lost, wildly beautiful friend who married a maharaja 20 years before writes from India that she is dying of dengue fever (seriously). She asks Blaze and Jane to take in her daughter, Ayesha. Of course, when the 19-year-old arrives, she brings a new layer of chaos.</td>

The U.S. enjoys all of these advantages but mounted one of the worst responses to the pandemic: 1 in every 990 Americans has died from Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Bad politics, quite simply, can trump good public health.<br />Other developed countries that did well initially, such as Canada and some European nations, have faltered during the second or third surge of infections, because their governments and people grew tired of implementing effective strategies. In many Asian countries, it has long been common for people to wear masks when feeling ill, so they adopted masks early and widely.<br />Best at early action: Taiwan<br />1 reported Covid-19 death per 3,366,140 people</td>

Can we not go down the road of misty pony-car nostalgia, again? Must we give credence to this weird non sequitur? For 56 years the nameplate has denoted two-door coupes and convertibles; now, for no particular good reason I can tell, it also denotes a midsize electric four-door hatchback—oh, sorry, fastback. They might as well have called it a Cobra, or Crown Victoria, or the Barney Oldfield 999 Special.<br />Ford’s engineering execs have been on teleconference press tours this fall in support of the company’s first mass-market EV, to be built in Mexico, with global sales expected to be around 50,000 in the first year. They have explained how, late in the design phase, vice president Jim Farley (now CEO) sent the team back to the drawing boards with orders to make the then-unnamed project more Mustang-ish—more raked windshield, faster hatch, blacked-out C-pillar—until finally someone suggested they just call it a Mustang.<br />Really? This high-sitting four-door hatchback with the dad bod screamed Mustang to management? That’s... surprising. Ford execs repeat this story as if it weren’t a parable of creative laziness.<br />Not to be a killjoy. Some of the Mustang-themed features are charming: the three-bar taillights; the illuminated galloping mustang logo in the nose (GT trim and above). The three drive modes are “Whisper,” “Engage” and “Unbridled.” Oh, honey! The latter mode corresponds to a typical sport mode, putting a sharper edge on the throttle response and adding heft to the steering feel. The Unbridled mode also permits a certain value of wheel spin, at both front and rear axles, so you can horse around a bit...sorry.<br />Idiomatic note: In UK-market cars the sport mode is called Untamed. Grrr. No word on ripped-bodice upholstery.</td>

In states across the country, new laws and regulations will be going into effect, including some aimed at addressing worker safety, affordable health care and other issues that emerged this year from the coronavirus. Others target matters like racial inequality and policing that were thrust into the national spotlight in 2020.<br />In many statehouses, lawmakers worked remotely for much of the year because of the pandemic. That also led to some truncated legislative sessions—and to far fewer laws being passed than in a typical year in states like California and Illinois.<br />Here is a look at some of the new laws for 2021:<br /><br /></td>

Chief Executive Ed Bastian expects improvement starting this spring. Alaska Airlines President Ben Minicucci said he hopes to get back to 80% of pre-pandemic capacity by summer. United CEO Scott Kirby, however, said travel may not start getting back to normal until vaccines are widely distributed—in late 2021.<br />“I recognize a lot of people are saying it’s going to happen faster, and I hope they’re right,” he said in a December interview. “This is one of those strange situations where I think we’re probably better at forecasting what’s going to happen a year from now than we are what’s going to happen next quarter.”<br />Their strategies for coping with the uncertainty are just as diverse. Airlines are shutting down some international markets and running reduced schedules while also buying new planes and adding new cities in an attempt to capture demand where it exists. United is returning to New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in February after a five-year absence, while rival  Southwest Airlines Co.  plans to fly from Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport for the first time ever in 2021.  JetBlue Airways Corp.  is also adding flights this year at Miami International Airport—the busiest U.S. airport it didn’t yet serve.<br />The coronavirus pandemic brought a travel boom to a crashing halt last spring as people stopped traveling for work and everything from weddings to funerals were held over Zoom. It wiped out over two-decades worth of growth in a matter of months, according to aviation data provider Cirium, sending global air traffic plummeting to levels last seen in 1999.</td>

      <td>The pandemic wreaked havoc on museums’ exhibition schedules in 2020, and the 2021 calendar remains somewhat unpredictable. But a number of expansive, well-considered shows are planned for this year, including solo exhibitions spotlighting innovative contemporary artists. Several of those artists shared thoughts on the past year and what they’re looking forward to in 2021. (Dates may change, so it’s best to check with museums before visiting.)<br />Intense physicality and an expressive hand give the geometric abstractions of Sean Scully, 75, a resonantly human touch. His retrospective, “Sean Scully: The Shape of Ideas,” is slated to open in June at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Much of Mr. Scully’s studio time last year was devoted to his continuing “Landline” series of paintings, in which horizontal bands of varying colors evoke landscapes and horizons. He also worked on “more nihilistic, pessimistic paintings, with black squares in the middle. Which I find very symbolic of the time,” he said. In 2021, he is looking forward to “Jasper Johns: Mind/Mirror,” a nearly 500-work retrospective that will open Sept. 29 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.<br />For Bisa Butler, the term that best describes the current moment is “hyperdrive.” After months of focused studio time, “I feel my own mind so full of ideas, projects and future collaborations,” she said, noting that the lockdown “has emboldened me to connect with people I admire.” Ms. Butler, 47, reinterprets vintage photographs of African-Americans as oversize, brilliantly colored quilts, playing pattern against pattern and layering fabrics to create nuanced tones. “Bisa Butler: Portraits” opened at the Art Institute of Chicago in November, a few days before the museum shut down; the show will continue when the Art Institute reopens.<br />Among the artists Ms. Butler is hoping to see more of in 2021 are Faith Ringgold, Romare Bearden and El Anatsui. She is also looking forward to the emergence of new work by other artists, noting that “as these projects come to fruition, we will see the creative abundance of the lockdown.”<br />Pat Steir, 80, creates abstract paintings by pouring, splashing and flinging color at the canvas. Often an element of chance is skillfully factored into the process. Between uninterrupted studio time and postponed exhibitions, “the lockdown is a kind of dream and nightmare in one,” she said. When the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. reopens, “Pat Steir: Color Wheel”—a massive, 30-painting installation spanning the circular inner gallery on the museum’s second floor—will resume its interrupted run.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The relationship between President-elect Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spans more than three decades. They now must  draw on those ties to steer a divided Democratic coalition amid a pandemic and an economy recovering from a deep slump.<br />The president-elect and speaker have both reached the highest levels in U.S. party politics by forging coalitions among disparate members of their party, including moderates and progressives, according to their allies and advisers. The pair’s history of legislating together has created what colleagues describe as mutual trust.<br />Mr. Biden and Mrs. Pelosi, who both hope to start by passing additional measures to address the coronavirus pandemic, must unite party members who have bickered over issues such as expanding government health insurance, how much to spend to combat climate change and criminal-justice policy.<br />The pair also must work with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York to win over enough Republicans to clear that chamber’s 60-vote threshold for most bills. Control of the Senate—which could determine the success or failure of much of the Democratic agenda—hinges on the outcome of two Jan. 5 runoff races in Georgia.<br />The last time a Democratic president came into office, the party had a comfortable House majority and briefly held a Senate supermajority. This time, with two House races not called, Democrats have only a few more seats than the 218 required for a House majority. Mr. Biden has tapped three House lawmakers to serve in his administration, which will temporarily shrink the majority further.</td>

It didn’t end well for his startup at the time.<br />This time, Andre Haddad decided to be more aggressive. At the end of March, Mr. Haddad laid off a third of his 330-person workforce. The next month, he cut spending on marketing to zero, where it would stay for the entire second quarter. He studied every expense to try to find savings and shore up three years of cash.<br />Turo’s financial turnaround suggests the moves are working. The peer-to-peer car-renting marketplace reported its first-ever profitable quarter this year, according to results shared with The Wall Street Journal, and Mr. Haddad forecasts achieving full-year profitability in 2022, before adjusting for interest and taxes.<br />Mr. Haddad plans to publicly list shares of Turo this year, buoyed by the company’s success and following the strong performance of many tech initial public offerings in 2020. He is undecided whether he will pursue a traditional IPO and is open to alternatives, such as going public through a merger with a blank-check corporation.<br />Turo is a website where private car owners rent their vehicles by the day, week or month, including luxury rides like Lamborghinis. The car-renting marketplace joins  Airbnb Inc.  in a category of startups that looked precarious at the start of the pandemic but have since benefited from an unexpected shift in consumer behavior during widespread lockdown orders.</td>

Even so, funds won’t be enough to meet the strain of the latest nationwide surge, said Rick Pollack, the American Hospital Association’s chief executive. More than 125,000 Covid-19 patients were in U.S. hospitals as of Wednesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project, another national record.<br />“The surge in cases is ongoing,” said Tom Nickels, the association’s executive vice president, increasing hospitals’ financial strain from higher staffing and supply costs for Covid-19 patients and revenue losses, as other services are suspended. “We anticipate we will need additional funding.”<br />New limits on relief may also inadvertently disadvantage hospitals with patients most severely affected by the pandemic, health-policy experts said.</td>

      <td>Jay DeFeo’s monumental ‘The Rose’ weighed 2,300 pounds when completed.</td>
      <td>Some artists are identified with a single work. With Leonardo da Vinci it’s the Mona Lisa, with Grant Wood it’s “American Gothic.” Which brings us to Jay DeFeo (1929-1989) and her strange, huge sculptural painting, “The Rose” (1958-66).<br />DeFeo was one of those lucky kids whose talent and enthusiasm for art was noticed early on by a high-school teacher; in her case it was Lena Emery in San Jose, Calif. The mentoring led to museum visits in San Francisco and, eventually, a master’s degree from the University of California, Berkeley, followed by a grant for a trip to Europe and North Africa. In 1954 she married Wally Hedrick, one of the weirder of the many weird Bay Area artists, and set up shop in a large second-floor space on Fillmore Street in jazz- and beatnik-infused San Francisco. By 1958, DeFeo was ready to start a work that she seems to have known, in an inchoate way, would end up her masterpiece with a capital M.<br />In it, she grayed down her colors from her earlier Abstract Expressionism-influenced paintings, and then built up the paint by applying it almost like plaster. She’d painted small pictures of relatively realistic single roses before, but this one would be a monumental rose—a huge painting so physically thick that it would border on sculpture. In DeFeo’s words, it was simply an “idea that had a center to it.” That idea initially checked in at about seven feet wide by nine feet tall, but within a year the artist—with the help of some friends—mounted the work on an even larger canvas, about 11 feet high. DeFeo painted and painted and painted—from 1958 into 1966—chiseling into the material when it had dried. To prevent the work from sagging to the point of collapse, she inserted wooden dowels from the rear to prop up its surface. In the end, “The Rose”—which DeFeo called “a marriage between painting and sculpture”—weighed over a ton.<br />“The Rose” is built on one of the hokiest compositional clichés—a starburst from a pinpoint center—and it’s executed in another decorator’s commonplace, fluting that causes its ostensibly unoriginal arrangement to exist in actual light and shadow. Superficially, “The Rose” has no right to come across as anything more than a rococo-modernist backdrop for some megabank’s conference room. But it’s a genuinely beautiful and powerful work of art.<br />The center of “The Rose” is as threatening as it is pretty, as knife-like as it is floral. Its burst, as it were, doesn’t extend conveniently all the way to the edges of the painting. Instead, as the furrows expand outward from the center, they gradually transition into being defined at their edges by larger lumps of paint until just before the physical borders of the work.</td>

      <td>Investors are enthusiastic about QuantumScape, developer of an electric-vehicle battery that promises more power for less cost. If the company succeeds, Tesla could face new challenges.</td>
      <td>One of the wildest plotlines in the great 2020 electric-vehicle rally was the late-year rise of  QuantumScape ,  a battery startup that has yet to report any revenue. If investors are even close to being right about its roughly $44 billion market value, they may need to worry more about the fortunes of Tesla.<br />QuantumScape’s shares have soared since going public in November. The company revealed promising test results for a limited version of its “solid state” battery in early December, but otherwise the stock’s meteoric ascent has been hard to explain.<br />Based in San Jose, Calif., and backed by  Volkswagen  and Bill Gates, the company now has a market value greater than  Ford .  Investors have gotten used to dizzying valuations for electric-vehicle startups positioning themselves as the next Tesla. With QuantumScape, the mania has reached potential suppliers too.<br />Solid-state batteries have long been seen as a way of breaking through performance limitations associated with today’s electric vehicles. Like your smartphone, a Tesla or  BMW  i3 is powered by a battery with a liquid electrolyte that carries lithium ions back and forth between the cathode and anode during charging and discharging. These liquid electrolytes are bulky and liable to overheat.  General Motors recalled almost 69,000 Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles in November after five reported fires.<br />The promise of solid state is to get rid of the liquid, and with it the fire risk. Moreover, “lithium-metal” cells being developed by QuantumScape, among others, combine the lithium component with the anode, further reducing bulk and potentially delivering more power at a lower cost. This is also critical: Electric vehicles have long been held back by the relatively high cost of batteries, which makes them more expensive than combustion-engine equivalents.</td>

The firm’s staffers hope to grow the fund to between $4 billion and $6 billion in assets over time, people familiar with the matter said.<br />Best known for funds that track broad markets and trade on exchanges, BlackRock launched fundraising for a strategy in 2018 to make direct, long-term investments in private companies. The fund was an aggressive gambit to take on private equity’s big league deal makers.<br />Private markets are one of the few corners of finance untouched by fee pressures that have pulled the cost of investing closer to zero. But it is hard to build a presence from scratch. Many asset managers face challenges replicating their reach over stock-and-bond markets in the complex, labor-intensive business of investing in privately held companies.<br />So far, BlackRock has raised less than one-third of its original goal—$3.4 billion, as of the end of 2020, according to people familiar with the matter. BlackRock, which had an initial year-and-a-half window to raise money for the fund, missed internal fundraising deadlines and asked investors for a few more months to seek money, according to some of the people familiar with the matter. Now BlackRock can’t raise further money until 80% of that money is invested, fund documents dictate.</td>

The Federal Reserve’s massive stimulus package and, later, news of a vaccine, stoked a simultaneous rally in various markets. The moves have been underpinned by an excitement for investing that hasn’t been seen in decades, as people of all ages jumped into the market to ride its wild moves.<br />Stocks soared in 2020. After plunging into a bear market—defined as a drop of at least 20%—a new bull market emerged, one that raced to new highs faster than ever before. The S&P 500 climbed 16.3% to end the year at a record, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 44%, its best year since 2009. The Russell 2000 small-cap stock index has roughly doubled from its March low.<br />The pandemic “put the U.S. economy and markets on the biggest bust-to-boom roller coaster we’ve seen,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. “It caused people to dump far more when it was collapsing—has caused them to chase assets on the way up.”<br />Here are five investment trends that boomed in 2020, defying many market watchers’ expectations.

      <td>From stimulus checks to early retirement-plan withdrawals, here are some late-breaking items that could alter either your 2020 return or how you approach your taxes in the year to come</td>
      <td>With taxes, small changes often add up to big differences—and major confusion.<br />Last year Congress passed two important bills in response to Covid-19 that contain a slew of tax changes, with the most recent one signed by President Trump on Dec. 27. Some of the changes apply only to 2020, while others affect more than one year or take effect beginning in 2021. The new year also brings automatic inflation adjustments that slightly shift tax brackets and some other thresholds.<br />That’s a lot to keep straight, so here’s a rundown of the most recent tax changes and when they apply, according to the Senate Finance Committee, plus an overview of this year’s key tax numbers. Happier New Year in 2021!<br />• Stimulus payments. The year-end relief and spending package just signed into law includes a second round of stimulus checks. This payment is up to $600 per taxpayer ($1,200 for married joint filers) plus $600 per qualifying child under age 17. It begins to phase out at $75,000 of adjusted gross income for most single filers and $150,000 of AGI for most married joint filers. For individuals without children, the payments go to zero when income reaches $87,000, or $174,000 for couples filing jointly. The second round of stimulus payments, like the first, isn’t taxable.<br />Payments are already going out, and most are based on taxpayers’ income as listed on their 2019 tax returns. If the recipients’ 2020 income turns out to be much higher, they won’t need to give the payments back. Taxpayers who earned too much in 2019 to receive checks but whose income dropped enough to qualify for the stimulus can claim payments through their 2020 tax returns.</td>

      <td>Minneapolis police on Thursday released body camera footage of a fatal police shooting that they said showed the man firing first on police.<br />The incident, which took place Wednesday night, is the first time the city’s police have killed someone since the Memorial Day death of George Floyd.<br />Body camera footage shows multiple police vehicles blocking a white sedan, the driver of which appears to attempt to drive through the line of vehicles. Shouts of “Hands up, hands up…police!” can be heard. The man appears to shoot first, breaking the driver-side window. Police then fire at the car.<br />“A tragic and difficult day is capping what’s been a tragic and difficult year,” said Mayor Jacob Frey. “Our city is experiencing a lot of raw emotion right now.”<br />Chief Medaria Arradondo said in a Thursday press conference that he had met with family members of the man who was killed by police and watched the body camera footage with them before releasing it to the public.</td>

      <td>We got through 2020 with pictures of normality in our heads. In a few months they’ll start to come true.</td>
      <td>You have to go into this year with dreams, there’s no other way to do it. We’re still in an epic struggle, and it will be a while before things settle down into some approximation of normal. Dreams are how we got through 2020, or maybe not dreams precisely but a picture you kept in your head that helped you keep going, that captured what you missed and will have again. It was a picture of When the Pandemic is Over and we carried it in our psychic wallets.<br />My friend John’s picture: He’s in Fenway Park, the seats are full and close together, and he orders a Fenway Frank and chowder, and the other people in the row pass them down without fear or masks. Someone gets a hit and no one’s afraid to cheer. He is certain this will come.<br />My friend the professor would see this: He and his students are in a room, and he is teaching them. For what seems like forever they’ve been postage-size faces on Gallery View on Zoom, which is how they see him. But in his head they’re together and know each other and he’s Mr. Chips again, not Max Headroom.<br />A friend who’s a reporter kept in her head the idea of future spontaneity. She’d be on the phone with a friend: Whatcha doin’? Wanna get in a car and get lost? What if we just show up and surprise them? Let’s see who’s in town.<br />My vision of 2021, the picture I held of that future, came into my head in early summer. This would come: We are gathered in a darkened theater, 1,500 of us, for the first time since March 2020. The orchestra starts, the curtain rises, and on the stage a crowded old railroad coach is in full cry. The train conductor booms, “River City next station stop!” And in the audience applause starts, unplanned, just erupting, and the actors playing the salesmen on the train play through. “Ya can talk-talk-talk. . . . Ya can talk all ya wanna, but it’s different than it was.” Suddenly a tall man in a natty suit comes forward: “Gentlemen, you intrigue me. I think I’ll have to give Iowa a try.” It’s Professor Harold Hill, the Music Man. He’s played by Hugh Jackman. We’re at the revival that was supposed to open in 2020. Now pent-up emotion really breaks out and what builds is a wave of unstoppable cheers, and then we can’t help it, we stand. And Mr. Jackman understands this moment, and after a minute he stops the show, and in a great flourish, as if speaking for all the history of the theater past and present, makes a deep and graceful bow. As if theater itself were bowing to all of those by whom it lives.</td>

      <td>Columbus, Ga.<br />Joe Biden won Georgia.<br />That statement isn’t as hard on Republicans’ ears as it was in early November. A hand recount that concluded Dec. 7, the Electoral College vote on Dec. 14, and the simple passing of time have made the result seem final, even among voters who doubt it.<br />But for weeks, widespread denial among Republicans obscured the result’s significance. With 49.5% of the vote to President Trump’s 49.3%, Mr. Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1992 to carry Georgia. No Democrat since Bill Clinton had won any state in the once solidly Democratic Deep South, defined to include Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina along with the Peach State.<br />Until this year, Southern Senate delegations seemed to have undergone a similar Republican realignment. With the exception of Alabama’s Doug Jones, who edged out a scandal-plagued Republican nominee in a 2017 special election (and was soundly defeated for a full term in November), no Democrat has won a Deep South Senate seat since 2008, and not one has unseated a Republican incumbent since 1986.</td>

      <td>The latest Census population statistics show a shift from blue to red.</td>
      <td>President Trump is soon expected to submit to Congress state population counts from this year’s Census for reapportionment. Last week the Census Bureau gave a preview of what to expect, and blue-state Democrats might want to prepare their smelling salts in advance.<br />Sixteen mostly coastal and Rust Belt states lost population from July 2019 to July 2020, according to the Census Bureau’s annual population survey, and Illinois, West Virginia, New York, Connecticut, Mississippi and Vermont have shrunk since 2010. At the same time, many low-tax Sun Belt states have continued to attract newcomers.<br />The pandemic may have contributed to population losses in some states as city dwellers with means escaped to rental and vacation homes. Foreign immigration also fell after President Trump suspended new green cards in April. Some states, especially in the Northeast, experienced thousands of more deaths than usual due to Covid.<br />But the bureau’s annual population estimate captures only the first few months of the pandemic when migration generally declined as most people hunkered down. Geographic mobility increased over the summer and fall, and the pandemic seems to have accelerated migration flows that have been occurring for years. States such as New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and California have counted on foreign immigration offsetting net out-migration. That didn’t happen this year, so many states lost population for the first time in decades.<br />California’s population shrank for the first time as far back as records go (-69,532). According to a separate state government survey, a net 261,000 residents moved to other states during the period, the most in nearly 25 years. High housing costs have been driving out the middle class for years. But now many large businesses are shifting workforces to other states.</td>

      <td>The crackdown continues in Hong Kong, and this week the Chinese government made an example of the territory’s most prominent political prisoners.<br />Publisher Jimmy Lai is back in jail after Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal revoked his bail. A long-time democracy advocate and critic of the Communist Party, Mr. Lai faces multiple charges for participating in last year’s Hong Kong protests, and authorities have also charged him under the new national-security law, which effectively outlaws dissent.<br />The maximum sentence is life in prison, and there’s no guarantee that Chinese authorities won’t extradite Mr. Lai to the mainland. A lower court enraged Beijing last week when it granted bail and allowed Mr. Lai to await his trial under house arrest as long as he refrained from giving interviews, posting on social media, or making public statements.<br />The prosecution cited Article 42 of the security law, which states that no bail can be granted “unless the judge has sufficient grounds for believing the criminal suspect or defendant will not continue to commit acts endangering national security.” Mr. Lai poses no such threat. He has bravely chosen not to flee despite having a British passport, and China wants to make an example of him to stifle all criticism.<br />Meanwhile on the mainland, a Shenzhen court meted out harsh sentences for 10 Hong Kongers who were arrested as they fled by boat to Taiwan. Authorities wouldn’t let these thwarted refugees meet with the lawyers hired by their families, and on Wednesday the court sentenced the 10 to between seven months and three years, almost certainly to be spent in China’s opaque and notorious prison system.</td>

      <td>Their playoff turn causes New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to rethink his shutdown orders.</td>
      <td>Whether or not they make it to the Super Bowl, the Buffalo Bills have already pulled off a miracle victory: persuading New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to let 6,700 fans attend their playoff game next weekend.<br />The Bills have won the AFC East division for the first time in 25 years and will host their first home playoff game since 1996. Buffalo could use the morale boost. It sure hasn’t received one from the billions of dollars Mr. Cuomo has spent trying to revive the western New York economy.<br />Mr. Cuomo has kept Bill fans locked out of the stadium all season, though 13 other NFL stadiums have allowed limited numbers to attend games. There has been only one report of a fan testing positive after an NFL game. Yet in November Mr. Cuomo proclaimed it would be “reckless” to let any fans into a stadium that could seat nearly 72,000.<br />Perhaps feeling the holiday spirit or pressure from upstate voters, Mr. Cuomo has reversed course. “We’re all feeling the excitement,” Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday. “We’ve all wanted the Buffalo Bills to be good, it’s been a long time, and that team has a charisma and personality that is infectious.”<br />The Governor’s plan requires all fans to be tested before the game and wear masks. The state also plans to hold drive-through rapid testing at the stadium, which he says would be a pilot for reopening businesses and live events.</td>

      <td>An audit in one county finds no fraud, but it puts officials on notice.</td>
      <td>Georgia’s audit of the November mail vote in Cobb County found “no fraudulent absentee ballots.” In a report Tuesday, the Secretary of State’s office explained how investigators double checked the signatures on 15,118 randomly chosen ballot envelopes. It’s a good warning to anybody contemplating shenanigans in Georgia’s Senate runoffs next week.<br />About 150,000 people in Cobb County voted by mail, so the sample was nearly 10% of the total. Most of the accepted signatures were clearly valid. Investigators ended up with 10 suspect envelopes. On eight of them, the signature “did not appear to be consistent with documents on record.” But once the voters were contacted, they confirmed the signatures were theirs. Handwriting can change, especially as people age.<br />That left two problem votes. One was missing a signature, and the voter “reported signing the front of the envelope only.” The other ballot was correctly voted, but then its envelope was “mistakenly signed by the elector’s spouse.” In both cases, the state said, Cobb County should have asked the voter to fix the mistake before accepting the ballot.<br />These are ordinary screw ups, not the mass fraud that President Trump claims. Two bad ballots out of 15,118 is an error rate of 0.013%. If you extrapolate that to Georgia’s 1,316,943 mail votes, it suggests 174 questionable ballots statewide. There are reasons to roll back mail voting, which could be a debacle if the margin were closer. But Mr. Trump lost Georgia by 12,000.<br />It’s good news that no fraud was found, yet some Trump supporters appear unwilling to accept defeat no matter the evidence. They include Mr. Trump, who tweeted: “When are we going to be allowed to do signature verification in Fulton County, Georgia?” The big difference is that in Cobb County a temporary election worker made a specific allegation to investigate.</td>

      <td>Scott Atlas’s op-ed “A Pandemic of Misinformation” (Dec. 22) contributes to the problem he laments. He writes that states directed their own pandemic policies, with governors and local officials responsible for outcomes. A lack of leadership from the White House left them no other choice. For example, Washington’s Opening Up America Again guidelines were well-received, but the administration promptly ignored them, pushing states to open before reaching important health benchmarks.<br />Jared Kushner relayed President Trump’s posture to Bob Woodward: The states would be responsible for the public-health burden while he’d own the reopening. “The opening is going to be very popular,” Mr. Kushner said.<br />An October Gallup report concluded that “the most important factor in Americans’ decision to [take Covid precautions seriously] is exposure to accurate information about the pandemic from sources they trust.” Mr. Trump played down Covid’s seriousness, belittled masks, flaunted CDC guidelines and ran a White House that became a Covid epicenter. The government’s investment in vaccines must be applauded. Otherwise, its actions fell short.<br />David Stone<br />Birmingham, Mich.</td>

      <td>More stimulus, more federal ‘investments’ in favored industries and state and local governments, more regulations and higher taxes.</td>
      <td>William A. Galston tees up Washington’s next massive stimulus package as essential to avoid a double-dip recession (“Can Team Biden Prevent a Recession?” Politics & Ideas, Dec. 23). Mr. Galston is concerned that “the pace of job growth has declined for five straight months and may have ceased in December.” Normal cyclical forces could be swamped by “structural changes” that were accelerated by the pandemic.<br />This may be unsettling, but the pace of job growth was destined to fall after a fairly rapid recovery from an extraordinary spike in job losses. Compare this with the 2007-09 recession. The unemployment rate peaked around 10% nine months into President Obama’s first year and didn’t drop to 6.7% for 50 months until December 2013. In 2020 the unemployment rate soared to nearly 15% in April and dropped to 6.7% only seven months later in November.<br />Secular stagnation was the excuse made for eight years of modest growth and slow labor-market recovery under Mr. Obama’s stewardship. It seems that Mr. Biden’s will be structural changes, but one guesses his solutions will be similar. Washington will pick up the economic slack with more stimulus, more federal “investments” in favored industries and state and local governments, more regulations and higher taxes.<br />How many trillions of dollars of federal spending will it take to get back to President Trump’s prepandemic unemployment rate of 3.5%? The rate didn’t get below 4.7% during the Obama-Biden years. Let’s hope the Biden-Harris solution isn’t to hire five million more federal workers.<br />Ryan Graham</td>
