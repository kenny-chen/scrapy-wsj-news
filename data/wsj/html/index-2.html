      <td>Practicing medicine was satisfying but not thrilling—so Dr. Pooja Goel began selling cosmetics, hair-care and skin-care products online</td>
      <td>When Pooja Goel was growing up in suburban Maryland, there was little question she would become a doctor. “It was just woven into the background,” she said. She was good at math and science, and her parents made no secret of their hope that their oldest daughter would pursue a career in medicine. “My mom’s sisters are all physicians and they all married physicians,” she said. Nobody on her father’s side had become a doctor, “and it was clear how much he valued that I would be the first.” Besides, she had no other career dreams. Instead, she said, “I was like, ‘This is what’s going to work.’ ”<br />In high school, Ms. Goel applied to B.A./M.D. programs, which prepare students to enter medical school right after college. She got into the hybrid program at Lehigh University and Drexel University’s medical school. “It was the ‘no-worry track,’ ” she recalled. There was a hitch, though: In her junior year, Ms. Goel got a C-minus in organic chemistry, which disqualified her from the medical-school portion of her program. When she spoke with the professor who had given her the bad grade, she remembered him saying, “Maybe your path is something different than medicine.”<br />His words only drove her to prove him wrong. She ended up enrolling at Ross University School of Medicine on the Caribbean island of Dominica. (It has since moved to Barbados). She liked the tropical setting and admired her classmates’ drive. “For a lot of them, medicine was their second career,” she said. Her residency at Philadelphia’s Chestnut Hill Hospital also was a positive experience, especially working at a family medicine clinic.<br />Dr. Goel’s first job was at an urgent care clinic in Maryland. She loved the pace of the work and the on-the-spot problem solving. “There was an element of excitement to my days,” she said. But working 14-hour shifts and coming home at 11 o’clock at night was another thing. She and her husband relocated to New York, where she worked at another urgent care clinic. “I knew I needed some time back,” she said.<br />She moved to a position at New York University’s student health services. For the first time in her career, she had a lunch hour and an eight-hour workday. “I was cooking dinner and doing laundry and roaming around New York,” she said. “I felt human again.” And yet, something was off. “It was better,” she said, “but it still wasn’t me.”</td>

      <td>JAKARTA, Indonesia—Authorities believe they have identified the location of the two so-called black boxes of the Sriwijaya Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea carrying 62 people.<br />Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of Indonesia’s national transportation safety committee, said Sunday that divers were being dispatched to try to recover the cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders.<br />Crews using helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and search-and rescue ships spent the day looking for and retrieving debris from the Boeing 737-500 that went down minutes after taking off from the capital, Jakarta, on Saturday afternoon. Authorities have also found human body parts and expect to use DNA testing to identify the victims, a Jakarta police spokesman said.<br />The plane, which was on a domestic flight to Pontianak on Indonesia’s Borneo island, was delayed before it took off Saturday afternoon due to inclement weather. Shortly after it was airborne, it made an unexpected turn, flying northwest, prompting air-traffic control to ask the plane to report its direction, the transportation ministry said. Seconds later, the aircraft disappeared from the radar, at 2:40 p.m. local time.<br />Authorities began search operations near a series of islands on the outskirts of Jakarta called Kepulauan Seribu, or Thousand Islands. They homed in on the area near Laki Island where the waters appeared of an unusual color and flow, potentially indicating an oil spill and burned fuselage connected to the crash, an air force official, Henri Alfiandi, said in a televised interview Sunday.</td>

      <td>Gains to be driven by a re-emerging economy but won’t offset all pandemic losses</td>
      <td>The U.S. economy is poised to add more jobs this year than any other on records dating back to 1939—though the expected gain is unlikely to fully replace losses last spring, when the coronavirus pandemic first took hold.<br />U.S. nonfarm payrolls will increase by 6.7 million by December 2021, from last month, according to data firm  IHS Markit .  Economic forecasting firm Oxford Economics predicts 5.8 million jobs. Economists at the University of Michigan forecast 5.3 million. All would put 2021 well ahead of the 4.3 million jobs created in 1946, at the start of the post-World War II expansion, for the best year on record. It would be much less in percentage terms, though, 5% versus 11% in 1946.<br />Such gains would be a dramatic turnaround from 2020’s net job loss of 9.4 million, according to the Labor Department’s jobs report Friday. The loss largely occurred in March and April, when employers shed 22 million jobs as states restricted activity to control the spread of the virus. Jobs grew in subsequent months, but the pace eased after June then turned negative in December.<br />Economists expect hiring to start slowly and gain momentum later in 2021, as the Covid-19 vaccine becomes widely available and consumers resume activities such as dining out and travel. The $900 billion in enhanced unemployment benefits, aid to businesses and other relief enacted late last month is also projected to boost the economy.<br />The speed of the recovery would be far faster than after the two previous recessions this century, which mostly reflects the severe and sudden nature of last year’s downturn and the unusual factors at work now in confronting a simultaneous health and economic crisis.</td>

Both companies said Parler hasn’t demonstrated in recent conversations that it can adequately address threats of violence on the platform.<br />“We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity,” Apple said in a statement. “Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety.”<br />The announcements from Amazon and Apple come a day after  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google suspended Parler from its Play Store app marketplace, citing violations of requirements for sufficient moderation of content for apps it distributes.<br />Interest in Parler has risen since November as larger social-network operators such as Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. have become more aggressive in policing content. On Friday, Twitter banned President Trump’s personal account, sparking criticism from conservatives online who felt the effort was biased against them.</td>

      <td>A hockey dad reflects on the long streak of losses  that reinforced his son’s love of the game and turned his team into winners</td>
      <td>Everyone wants what’s best for their kid, but no one knows what that is. It might be succeeding, but it might be failing. It might be winning, but it might be losing.<br />A lot of us who played youth sports remember the defeats far more clearly than the victories—the camaraderie of the locker room, how sweet a candy bar tastes amid bitterness, the foxhole fraternity. You just don’t bond with teammates after a win like you do after a loss. That’s when you learn to express and accept empathy. Even fans of pro teams look back on the losing streaks as a time of testing, a crucible from which the team and its nation of supporters emerge smaller but stronger. Without the wilderness, there is no paradise.<br />The Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a run of 26 straight losses through the 1976 and 1977 NFL seasons. The fans who stuck with them will be fans forever. The Baltimore Orioles started the 1988 baseball season with 21 straight losses, and a local radio broadcaster vowed to stay on the air continuously until they finally won. After LeBron James took his talents to Miami in 2010, the Cleveland Cavaliers suffered 26 straight losses. That’s what distinguishes Cleveland—not LeBron’s return and the championship that followed but the poise the faithful showed in the dark time. Anyone can be graceful in victory. It takes an aristocrat to keep it together when the walls cave in.<br />I’ve relearned this truth as a member of that most pitied and envied of species, the hockey parent. In the course of this second career, I have served as coach and air horn blower, chant leader, heckler and postgame pep talker while watching my son ascend from Mite to Bantam, House League to Travel.<br />In his third season in 2013, my son’s team of 9- and 10-year-olds never lost more than three straight games, won a gold medal at a faux Olympics in Lake Placid—Miracle on Ice!—and made a deep run in the Connecticut State Championship. There was happiness and buffoonery, boasting, celebration, pizza. In short, it was a typically good youth hockey season. He improved as a player but did not much change as a person.</td>

      <td>The wines served at the White House tell us a lot about the president in office at the time. Our wine columnist considers a recent book on the topic and also offers a roundup of White House favorites to uncork now.</td>
      <td>WHEN PRESIDENT-ELECT Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden move into the White House on January 20, what wines will they serve? Will they stick with the tried-and-true picks of their predecessors or select something more daring—a sparkling wine from Texas or Vermont perhaps?<br />As Frederick J. Ryan, Jr., recounts in “Wine and the White House: A History,” some American presidents were more fond of the grape than others, but they all recognized wine’s important political role.<br />Although it was published last fall, Mr. Ryan’s 456-page opus seems even more relevant now as current White House staffers prepare to hand their successors the keys to the cellar. Until reading this book, I’d never given much thought to the selection and service of wines by presidents and their staffers—in fact, I’d never given much thought to certain presidents, such as James Buchanan and Rutherford B. Hayes, at all. But thanks to Mr. Ryan I learned that the former liked wine so much he eventually drank himself into gout, while the latter liked wine so little he had to be all but forced to pull some corks. (His teetotaler wife was nicknamed “Lemonade Lucy.”)<br />President Harry S. Truman was apparently just as stingy with the juice. He served, it’s noted, a single glass of Champagne to guests before dinners, while during the meal “the process of refilling the empty wineglasses was deliberately slow.”<br />Wine is an excellent prism through which to consider past presidents and their accomplishments or misdeeds (or both). Take, for example, Richard M. Nixon. While the 37th president may have resigned in disgrace, he is also responsible for putting Schramsberg, the Napa Valley sparkling-wine producer, on the map when he served a 1969 Schramsberg Blanc de Blancs to Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1972 in a toast to the breakthrough in American-Chinese relations.</td>

      <td>State has administered nearly half of allotted doses, compared with about 28% nationally</td>
      <td>Connecticut’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout has been relatively smooth, health officials said, while the U.S. and many states lag behind their original distribution plans.<br />The state has administered about half its allotted doses, compared with neighboring New York, which has administered nearly one-third of its allotment, and New Jersey, with little more than a quarter of its doses distributed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Across the U.S., about 28% of all the first doses have been administered, according to the CDC.<br />The shortfall is due in part to a lag in reporting data, government officials and health experts said. But as the federal government has left it to states to determine what to do with the vaccines, and with some states pushing decision-making to local health departments and hospitals, the process has hit snags in many places.<br />Connecticut hospital executives said open lines of communication with Gov. Ned Lamont’s office and the Connecticut Department of Public Health, along with good coordination among the state’s hospitals have been important factors during the first phase. About 300,000 health-care and long-term care workers are eligible for the first phase.<br />“Our hospital systems, our federally qualified health centers and our local health departments have been successful in standing up very large clinics in very short order and getting those employees into those clinics and getting them vaccinated,” the state’s acting health commissioner, Deidre Gifford, said.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—Beijing hit back against recent U.S. restrictions targeting Chinese companies, saying it plans to ban Chinese firms and citizens from complying with foreign laws and sanctions it deems “unjustified.”<br />Beijing’s new rules, released Saturday, also allow Chinese companies to sue in Chinese courts those who comply with the foreign laws.<br />The rules come after the U.S. imposed various restrictions against Chinese companies. Those include blocking some Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies Co. from obtaining certain components made by U.S. or foreign suppliers, or accessing U.S. technology.<br />While the rules didn’t name any specific foreign laws or sanctions, they amp up pressure against U.S. and other foreign companies with a footprint in China, possibly forcing them to choose between American or Chinese regulations, according to people in the foreign business community.<br />They also come as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office this month, presenting him with the question of whether to overturn Trump administration actions targeted at China.</td>

Again.<br />The Browns and Steelers are still scheduled to play Sunday night in the wild-card round of the playoffs in a matchup that features one team that has been upended by the virus against another team that has seen its season jolted by outbreaks on opposing teams.<br />Cleveland wasn’t even able to gather players in person all week until late Friday afternoon because of the cases inside the club. Pittsburgh, which has been on the other side of the NFL’s two biggest outbreaks this season, is all too familiar with the potential consequences of these situations.<br />The NFL got through its 256 regular season games in its normal 17 weeks even if nothing was normal about this pandemic season. Stadiums were empty or partially filled, facilities were frequently closed because of positive tests and games were rescheduled, resulting in NFL action on each of the seven days of the week over the course of the year.</td>

The decision came after council representatives visited Sinovac’s factory in China last year and conducted a halal audit.<br />Part of the challenge of rolling out vaccines world-wide will be persuading enough people to take them to reach herd immunity. In many countries, Muslim and non-Muslim, the efforts must overcome safety concerns, suspicions and conspiracy theories, as well as religious and ethical objections.<br />Gelatin taken from pigs and cells created using tissue from human fetuses, which are both common in vaccine production, are aren’t halal, Muslim scholars say.<br />Acceptance of vaccinations before the coronavirus pandemic varied widely among Muslim countries, with high trust in countries like Bangladesh and Uzbekistan, according to a study of opinion in 149 countries published in September 2020 in the Lancet medical journal. It found that of the 10 countries with the most marked drop in confidence in vaccines over the four years through 2019, seven were predominantly Muslim: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Pakistan. The other three were Japan, Georgia and Serbia.</td>

      <td>How the singer’s newly folksy, ‘cottagecore’-inflected look is being enthusiastically imitated and decoded by her ‘Swiftie’ fans</td>
      <td>HATERS WILL say it’s just a braid. Simply a messy French braid hanging down the back of a young woman, alone in the woods. Nothing to it, right? Of course, the woman is Taylor Swift—captured in the stark, unassuming photo on the cover of “Evermore,” the album she released last month just a few days shy of her 31st birthday, and five months after its sister album “Folklore.” In the liner notes for “Evermore,” Ms. Swift called the album a gift for her fans. The cover bears neither the album’s nor Taylor Swift’s name, not even her face. Just one poignant braid—another offering in the form of a new signature hairstyle, destined to be decoded and imitated for years to come.<br />Ms. Swift is one of a tiny coterie of international stars (Beyoncé and Rihanna also come to mind) whose every aesthetic decision is deeply intentional and inevitably influential; her passionate fandom of millions of “Swifties” study every move she makes. “Evermore” was Ms. Swift’s eighth studio album to sell a million copies in a week and the question of female authorship is an intrinsic part of this superstar’s narrative—and her battles with streaming services. Whether she purposefully twisted 31 turns into her braid for each year of her life (as Swifties have speculated) is unconfirmed, and her team did not provide comment. However, in Taylor Swift’s storytelling-heavy world, a braid is certainly not just a braid.<br />For those fans, the slightly scruffy hairstyle is achievable because it’s legitimately natural. Living in relative isolation along with the rest of us, Ms. Swift styled herself for the album cover. A French braid is the kind of hairstyle you might attempt if you found yourself alone in the forest and feeling a little wistful, listening to old songs by Emmylou Harris and Joni Mitchell—both of whom Ms. Swift have named as influences. The artist has recently flirted with the “cottagecore” aesthetic, referring to the online enthusiasm for all things twee and prairie-flavored (think baskets, aprons and lacy nightgowns).<br />Erin Bliss, a 25-year-old Swiftie in Minot, N.D., who painstakingly embroidered a depiction of the “Evermore” braid onto cloth and posted it to TikTok, mused, “She is in those woods, she’s still isolated. I think we’re all kind of feeling that way with the pandemic and everything and I think that we’re looking for ways to escape and ‘Evermore’ and ‘Folklore’ definitely provide that level of escapism.”<br />The minute the album art appeared online, fans began painstakingly recreating it in photos of their own, from the winter sky to the French braid to the woodsy plaid coat (Ms. Swift’s was made by eco-friendly designer and collaborator Stella McCartney). Kristyne Marie Gooden, a 30-year-old marketer in Orlando, Fla. who does Taylor Swift impersonations, said that when the surprise album dropped she initially “took a full 10 minutes to lose my mind.” Then, “the first thing I did after I calmed down was braid my hair, immediately.” She posted her faithful facsimile of the album art to Instagram, where it racked up thousands of likes, more than any image she’d ever posted.</td>

      <td>After a two-year renovation of the skylights and roof of the Met, many of the museum’s European masterpieces have never looked better.</td>
      <td><br />For the past two years, about half of the old master galleries at the top of the grand staircase of the Metropolitan Museum of Art have been closed for phase one of a four-year project to repair and upgrade the roof and skylights over that part of the building. Since the skylights date from 1939 and were last remodeled in 1952, the work was desperately needed; buckets to catch leaks were apparently a permanent fixture above the ceilings. Now, 21 galleries have reopened with “A New Look at Old Masters,” a freshly rethought installation of works from the 13th to the early 19th centuries. It’s an engaging mix of old friends, greatest hits and surprises, described as “a prelude to the final, extensive reinstallation of the European paintings galleries,” two years hence when the project is completed.<br />The magical flood of natural light from the new skylights will vary with the time of day and the season (with strategic artificial supplements when necessary). Thanks to sophisticated, state-of-the-art baffles and high-tech glass, the light is perfectly modulated, with no shadows. Works we’ve loved all our lives have never looked better, while some that we may have slighted in the past demand and reward attention in thought-provoking groupings and comparisons that reveal the wealth and depth of the collection. Some galleries seem a little crowded, especially given social-distancing protocols, but that’s unavoidable, given the abundance of notable holdings and the reduced exhibition space currently available; the pleasure of seeing so many stellar works more than compensates. (Dutch Golden Age paintings remain downstairs, in the Lehman Wing.)<br />Organized thematically and chronologically, but not in strict sequence, the installation underlines the aesthetic desiderata of various times and places, and brings to life relationships among artists, revealing similarities and differences, influences and rejections. Occasionally, sculpture and selections from the decorative arts collection enlarge our conception of the taste of a moment. The text panels throughout are minimal but informative, with lucid discussions of such vexed issues as the ideology surrounding depictions of enslaved people and Africans in the Renaissance and Baroque periods, opportunities for women artists, and the foundation of the fortune of the Met’s munificent benefactors H.O. and Louisine Havemeyer in the sugar industry, placed near works that trigger questions.<br />We begin with “Baroque Europe, Between Naturalism and Theatricality”: dramatically lighted religious motifs enacted by large figures, painted by Italian and Spanish luminaries. The installation evokes the lively mix of international artists in Rome in the early 17th century and the influence those artists exerted. Diego Velázquez’s early, straightforward “The Supper at Emmaus” and Caravaggio’s brooding, cinematic “The Denial of St. Peter” embody, when placed together, the polarities of the gallery’s theme. Caravaggio’s potent influence is evident in theatrically lighted scenes by Guercino and Jusepe de Ribera, the expat Spaniard who maintained Caravaggism in Naples. A luminous Guido Reni offers an alternative, lyrical approach, while muscular naturalism is announced by Bernardo Strozzi’s “Tobias Curing His Father’s Blindness.”</td>

      <td>Prime Minister Conte fights for survival, as he wrestles with former Premier Renzi over how to spend EU funds aimed at helping Italy</td>
      <td>ROME—In the depths of the pandemic, one sign of normality is returning to Italy: political instability.<br />The government of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is struggling to avoid collapse after a small coalition member threatened to withdraw vital parliamentary support. The Italia Viva party, led by former Italian Premier Matteo Renzi, has long been skeptical of Mr. Conte’s leadership and is raising pressure on a range of issues, including how to reconstruct Italy’s battered economy after the pandemic.<br />If Mr. Renzi pulls out of the coalition, forcing Mr. Conte to resign, the possible outcomes range from a new government with the same center-left leaders to snap elections that a rival center-right alliance would likely win.<br />Many observers predict Mr. Conte will continue, albeit with Mr. Renzi’s small party having more clout. Whatever the outcome, the tussle shows that the surprising stability of Italian politics during the pandemic is coming to an end.<br />Mr. Conte, a little-known law professor chosen to lead two rickety coalition governments in 2018 and 2019, has become an unexpectedly strong premier since last year, when Italy became the first Western country severely struck by Covid-19. His approval ratings rose as he worked with allies and opposition parties to orchestrate the first lockdown of a whole country, using rigorous measures that were soon adopted around the world.</td>

Here’s what you can learn from these ambitious exercisers to help you set and achieve goals of every scope.<br />Mr. Marett, a 33-year-old staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force, moved his bed sideways to create an indoor oval running course and used the activity tracker Strava to determine that 85 laps equaled about a mile.<br />“It began as a simple 1-mile run, some calisthenics, and 1 more mile,” he says. “But I began looking at running certain distances as a unique challenge. I started with a 5k, completed a 10k, 15k and half marathon in successive days, gave myself three days off and ran a full marathon.”<br />He completed the 26.2 miles in four hours, 27 minutes and 28 seconds; 2,227 laps around the room. He posted Strava snapshots of his quarantine runs to a virtual run group on  Facebook  and says the support kept him motivated to reach the marathon distance.</td>

Washington and Pyongyang remain stalemated on nuclear talks that haven’t shown discernible progress for nearly two years following the abrupt end to talks in Hanoi.<br />“Our biggest enemy and main hurdle is the U.S.,” said Mr. Kim, according to text of the remarks published by state media Saturday.<br />The key to Washington-Pyongyang relations, Mr. Kim said, was the U.S. dropping its hostile policy toward the North. That Kim regime assertion over the years has meant everything from U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and throughout Asia, their joint military drills and international discussion about the North’s human rights violations.<br />But the North Korean leader’s remarks about the U.S. were measured by Pyongyang’s saber-rattling standards. Mr. Kim didn’t make any imminent promise to launch missiles or threaten military action. He even referred to the North as being a “responsible nuclear weapons owner.”</td>

      <td>The economy is poised for a boom in 2021 after a December setback.</td>
      <td>Equity markets took in stride Friday’s labor report showing 140,000 job losses in December, and that sounds right. The slump is the clear and unsurprising result of renewed state lockdowns amid the latest Covid-19 surge. But the economy looks poised for a boom in 2021, with another jobs acceleration, once vaccines roll out and the virus emergency subsides.<br />Leisure and hospitality accounted for the bulk of the job losses (498,000), as states such as Washington, Michigan and Pennsylvania banned indoor dining. California even barred restaurants from serving outdoors amid a broad lockdown that closed most personal services. New unemployment claims in California alone last month totalled more than 710,000.<br />Yet the jobless rate stayed at 6.7% as most lockdown losses were offset by strong job growth in such industries as manufacturing (38,000), construction (51,000) and even retail (120,500). Employment in residential construction grew by some 57,200 in 2020.<br />Employment is also up 172,100 year-over-year at big-box retailers like  Walmart ,   Costco  and  Target .  They’ve been growing fast to compete with  Amazon .  The pandemic shift to online commerce has created 223,200 new jobs in couriers and 103,500 in warehouses over the last year. Most new jobs tied to online commerce aren’t going away once the virus ebbs.<br />Payrolls were also revised up 135,000 for October and November, which underscores the strong job growth before states tightened business restrictions. Permanent layoffs also fell 348,000 last month while temporary layoffs increased 277,000, which suggests plans to rehire workers once restrictions ease.</td>

      <td>The House Speaker publicizes her nuclear option to protect the world from Trump.</td>
      <td>We scoured the U.S. Constitution Friday afternoon and it’s definitely not there: the provision allowing the Speaker of the House of Representatives to intervene in the military chain of command to protect the world from President Trump.<br />Mrs. Pelosi told her Democratic colleagues that she spoke Friday morning to Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “to discuss available precautions for preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike.” She posted the “Dear colleague” letter on her website to make sure the world got the message. A spokesman for Gen. Milley told reporters the chairman “answered her questions.”<br />The press and left-wing  Twitter  (we repeat ourselves) love the idea of the Speaker inserting herself into the chain of command as a rebuke to an erratic President. But it’s an abuse of her own power, which is limited to leading the legislative branch unless both the President and Vice President are incapacitated or removed from office. In that case she is third in line for the Presidency.<br />But in the meantime she has no business telling the Joint Chiefs not to follow the President’s orders. Gen. Milley hardly needs the lecture, as he has been dealing with Mr. Trump for 15 months and isn’t about to indulge an unlawful order, much less an effort to launch nuclear weapons.<br />Mrs. Pelosi’s call to Gen. Milley is itself a violation of the separation of powers by seeking to inject herself into an executive-branch military decision. She can offer advice all she wants, but this call at this time has the sound of an order. It might even be construed by some as its own little coup—conniving with the military to relieve of command the person who remains the elected President.</td>

      <td>China taunts the world as it arrests the entire democratic opposition.</td>
      <td>With the tumult in America this week, readers may have missed the ominous news from Hong Kong, where police arrested more than 50 former lawmakers and dissenters on Wednesday. The list includes one American, and the roundup is an early test for the Biden Administration.<br />The prisoners were arrested for their roles as candidates or organizers of a pro-democracy primary election last July. Some 600,000 Hong Kongers voted in the primary, which isn’t part of the formal political process but which would have determined who challenged pro-Beijing candidates in the 2020 Legislative Council elections. The Communist Party fears an electoral humiliation after pro-democracy district council candidates won in a landslide in the November 2019 election.<br />Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, Beijing’s agent, warned last July that if the pro-democracy camp tried to gain Legislative Council seats to resist Beijing’s agenda, that “may fall into the category of subverting state power.” Authorities later postponed the legislative elections, and the arrests make clear that now even campaigning as a pro-democracy candidate is a crime under China’s new national-security law. This is what Russia has done with opposition candidate Alexei Navalny.<br />The arrested include Benny Tai, who helped with the logistics of the primary; former lawmaker Alvin Yeung, an outspoken defender of the independent judiciary; former legislator Claudia Mo; union organizer Carol Ng; and Jimmy Sham, who organized protests that turned out millions in 2019 and was attacked by thugs wielding hammers.<br />Also snatched was Hong Kong resident and American human-rights lawyer John Clancey, who served as treasurer for a pro-democracy political group. He and many of the others arrested this week have since been released on bail. Yet they could face re-imprisonment at any time, like media tycoon Jimmy Lai, whose bail was revoked last month and is behind bars awaiting trial over the 2019 protests. Under the new national-security law, the maximum sentence is life in prison. The arrests show that Hong Kong is now thoroughly under the Communist Party’s rule and any dissent will be punished.</td>

      <td>After raising tax rates, Gov. Murphy increases corporate welfare.</td>
      <td>Perhaps the biggest winners in the Georgia Senate runoffs are Democratic states banking on federal budget relief. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is already cashing his future check with $14 billion in new state business subsidies to mitigate his Covid-19 lockdown and corporate tax hike.<br />“Tax incentives should be used strategically and sparingly,” Mr. Murphy said in 2019. He added that “to those who bemoan our inability to pay for even the most basic items in our budget, let me say,” spending $1 billion a year on corporate subsidies “simply put, is nuts.” The Governor let the tax breaks lapse.<br />He’s now back to “nuts.” Legislation he signed Thursday provides $11.5 billion in tax breaks over seven years for real-estate projects as well as businesses that keep and create jobs in the state. Another $2.6 billion in tax credits are for film production.<br />Mr. Murphy says the tax breaks are needed to help businesses hurt by the pandemic—i.e., his excessive business shutdowns. New Jersey’s 10.2% unemployment rate in November was the highest in the country. But last year he extended the state’s “temporary” corporate tax hike and borrowed $4 billion to avoid spending cuts. Trenton Democrats in 2018 raised the state’s top corporate rate to 11.5% from 9% for businesses with more than $1 million in income. That gave New Jersey the highest rate in the country after Iowa (12%). The tax increase was supposed to fall to 10.5% last year and sunset after 2021, but Democrats, no surprise, extended the 11.5% rate through 2023.<br />Now Democrats are offering a salve to politically favored businesses, thus completing the cycle of political life in New Jersey: Make rich promises to public unions, increase taxes and borrowing to pay for them, and then spend to keep businesses and jobs from leaving. Revenues have improved in New Jersey since the spring, but the budget is still bleeding from unsustainable pension obligations.</td>

      <td>Go ahead and laugh. But if we’re such a joke state, why are all of your neighbors moving here?</td>
      <td>St. Petersburg, Fla.<br />Florida remains the Rodney Dangerfield of states, admired by some but derided by many. In his book “Best. State. Ever: A Florida Man Defends His Homeland,” Dave Barry laments that his adopted home is considered a “joke state.” But even Mr. Barry concedes that Florida, “because of its unique shape and warm climate, does have an unusually high percentage of low IQ people doing stupid things, frequently naked.” Last year, a study ranked Florida the country’s 28th smartest state. The headline in the Miami Herald was: “Florida is not the dumbest state in the union. Are you surprised?”<br />Florida may indeed be a kind of national punching bag, thanks in large part to the proliferation of crazy Florida Man stories that go viral. Since I moved here with my wife and two children in 2019, I regularly receive messages from friends from as far afield as Liechtenstein and Colombia alluding to Florida’s reputation as a generally idiotic place. During spring break, images of crowded Florida beaches, full of revelers—many of them out-of-towners—were plastered around the world as proof that Floridians are just a brain cell or two superior to sloths.<br />I got the feeling that many in the media and the population at large hoped that a calamity would befall us, so they could crow about how we got what we deserved. The pandemic has taken a toll here, but the per capita Covid-19 death rate in Florida is 23rd in the country, well behind strict lockdown states like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Illinois, Michigan and many others.<br />Florida is picked on reflexively, regardless of the situation, perhaps because bullies in the media are too dumb or unoriginal to vary their targets. When friends visit us, they are surprised to discover cities with character, like St. Augustine and St. Petersburg, because they’ve bought into the media narrative that Florida is nothing more than strip malls, subdivisions and brain-dead fools frying in the sun. Perhaps now is the time to reassess whether Florida deserves its status as the nation’s laughingstock.</td>

      <td>When it comes to denouncing or indicting inciters, there’s no reason to stop at Donald Trump.</td>
      <td>When white supremacists and counterprotesters descended on Charlottesville in 2017, police didn’t issue riot gear, close streets, or call immediately for state or federal backup. And it wasn’t because they weren’t forewarned or lacked intelligence on what was about to happen. Indeed, they had experienced a nearly identical situation with a KKK rally weeks before.<br />But in one way America isn’t a banana republic: Police will do almost anything to avoid firing into a crowd to interrupt lawbreaking or even risk the possibility. This also was true during the George Floyd protests, when police in New York flashed their lights and squawked on bullhorns but didn’t get out of their cars to stop store looters because it wasn’t worth risking lives to save a few $1,200 sweaters.<br />In the end, most of the invaders of the Capitol behaved more like tourists than insurrectionists, allowing themselves to be herded out when police had assembled a superior force. It could have been much worse but wasn’t because sense was prevalent on both sides.<br />A careful postmortem in Charlottesville showed that protesters are like your children: Each one is different. Political activists, gawkers and journalists show up as well as hatemongers of every description, drawn by a hope of mayhem and not overly observant of partisan narratives adopted for the convenience of the media. Was President Trump warned that threats to the Capitol had been circulating online for weeks? He should have been—in which case he might well worry about a charge of incitement.<br />If the storming of the Capitol finally inoculates voters against the worst tendencies of Trumpism, notice this goal was not vouchsafed by four years of Democrats and the media trying to counter Trump by emulating him, with false narratives and tortured or falsified evidence.</td>

Objections will be heard, evidence will be presented, and the elected representatives of the American people will make their decision.<br />Our Founders created the Electoral College in 1787, and it first convened in 1789. With the advent of political parties, the Electoral College was amended in 1804 to provide that Electors vote separately for President and Vice President. Following a contentious election in 1876, with widespread allegations of fraud and malfeasance, Congress spent a decade establishing rules and procedures to govern the counting of electoral votes and the resolution of any objections.<br />During the 130 years since the Electoral Count Act was passed, Congress has, without exception, used these formal procedures to count the electoral votes every four years.</td>

João Doria. Only two months ago, Mr. Bolsonaro told his supporters the vaccine, CoronaVac, could kill or disable them, without offering evidence, and refused to buy it.<br />But over the past few months, the Chinese vaccine has emerged as one of Brazil’s best bets to fight a pandemic that has cost the lives of more than 200,000 people here, second only to the U.S.<br />The Health Ministry said late Thursday that it had signed a contract with the Butantan Institute, the São Paulo state research center that has been testing and producing CoronaVac, to buy 46 million doses. The ministry said it has the option to buy another 54 million, enough to immunize 50 million people with the two dose-shot, or about a quarter of Brazil’s population.<br />Latin America is racing to secure doses as cases surge across the region. Hundreds of thousands of more people tested positive in Latin America this week, after many defied government warnings and held big family gatherings over the holidays and packed beaches at the start of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer. With only 8% of the world’s population, Latin America has accounted for nearly 30% of Covid-19 deaths.</td>

      <td>One of the most complicated and consequential decisions in retirement—when to start collecting Social Security—has been transformed by online calculators.<br />The conventional wisdom says that you should wait to claim benefits as long as possible, to maximize your payments. But one size doesn’t fit all, and people’s circumstances are often different than the standard assumptions about expected lifespan and career plans.<br />That’s where these calculators are useful. Put in your age and your spouse’s age, as well as information from your Social Security statement, and the calculators will tell you when you should each begin benefits to get the most money over your lifetimes.<br />And, most important, you can easily adjust the numbers based on your individual situation and see what you stand to gain or lose. If you think there’s information that the formulas aren’t taking into account, plug in a different number. For instance, you know if people in your families are short-lived or long-lived—but the algorithms don’t. The difference between what you get and what the calculator gives you originally can be striking.<br />There are a number of calculators to choose from. Some are free, such as Open Social Security, and some charge a fee, like Social Security Solutions or Maximize My Social Security.</td>

      <td>Artist-explorer Albert Bierstadt’s “A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie” looms as large in American cultural history as the towering peaks he depicts.</td>
      <td>In mid-June 1863,the celebrated German-born American painter Albert Bierstadt ventured by wagon into the high Rocky Mountains west of Denver, scouting scenes for a Colorado painting. When he got to the area below the Chicago Lakes, he was “in raptures with the scenery,” according to his companion. Soon he unpacked his brushes and paints to make an oil sketch.<br />So began Bierstadt’s work on his majestic “A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie” (1866), a 7-by-12-foot magnum opus that is one of the most prized artworks in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. Created in the gloomy Civil War era, the painting conveys the grandeur of the American West at a time when the nation’s belief in Manifest Destiny roused hopes and dreams even for citizens who were not headed west. Studded with emblems of the frontier—a soaring eagle, a black bear, pristine lakes, big skies, steep cliffs and a Native American camp—“A Storm” is, in the words of art historian Linda Ferber, writing in the museum’s 2006 “American Paintings in the Brooklyn Museum: Artists Born by 1876,” “a pivotal work in American cultural history.”<br />Bierstadt (1830-1902), who relished the role of artist-explorer that was blazed in Latin America by his contemporary Frederic Edwin Church, was painting for people who had little knowledge of Western terrain. For this scene of untamed nature, he chose a dramatic moment, cloaking his landscape in three weather patterns—a threatening thunderstorm in the craggy, snowcapped mountains in the distance; dazzling sunshine on the lower mountains and a misty lake in the middle-ground; and a fertile grassland in the foreground, where Indians race with their horses toward their teepees, possibly in anticipation of the storm.<br />At work in the Tenth Street Studio Building in Manhattan, Bierstadt referred to many drawings and oil sketches he made on his 1863 travels. He painted details like the grasses, ferns, wildflowers and animals meticulously, as correct renditions of nature. But to make this bold, stirring landscape, he also embellished—exaggerating geological features or adjusting their placement, using rich colors, and brilliantly heightening light and shadow effects to magnify the theatricality of his work.<br />Perhaps the small Native American camp in the left foreground was Bierstadt’s biggest stretch. No writings from this trip, or his two others to the West, suggest that he actually came face-to-face with Indians. He simply decided to insert them, engaged in a hunt (notice the dead deer). This invention allowed Bierstadt to convey the grand scale of the Rockies and, more important, to give the painting a human narrative, albeit one that exoticizes and romanticizes the West. Bierstadt was careful to paint their gear, like a blanket and saddle, accurately, scholars say, but he makes no allusion to the U.S. government’s drive to force Native Americans off their lands.</td>

      <td>The first rate increase since the financial crisis drew objections but no formal dissent</td>
      <td>Then-Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen pressed ahead in December 2015 with the central bank’s first interest rate increase in nearly a decade despite several colleagues’ misgivings over global economic weakness and weak inflation pressures, according to transcripts of the policy meeting released Friday.<br />Ms. Yellen, who has been nominated by President-elect Joe Biden to serve as Treasury secretary, argued for raising short-term rates to slow hiring and pre-empt inflationary pressures that could require more aggressive rate increases later.<br />“We would want to check the pace of employment growth somewhat to reduce the risk of overheating that could eventually force us to tighten abruptly,” she said at the Dec. 16 meeting. The decision to lift interest rates from near zero after holding them there for seven years was approved unanimously by the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.<br />But Ms. Yellen allowed for the risk that inflation dynamics weren’t operating as they had in prior periods, which is what transpired. “A more radical rethinking…would surely be in order,” she said, if inflation remained “persistently subdued…despite further improvements in the labor market.”<br />The Fed publishes a written summary of its policy meetings after a three-week delay, but these minutes don’t include verbatim quotes or identify speakers by name. Transcripts of the discussions providing those details are released after more than five years. The Fed on Friday released the transcripts of all its 2015 FOMC meetings.</td>

Sicknick, was struck in the head with a fire extinguisher during Wednesday’s unrest, according to a law-enforcement official. After he was injured, he returned to his division office and collapsed, the Capitol Police said, and was taken to a local hospital. Mr. Sicknick, 42 years old, died of his injuries at 9:30 p.m. Thursday.<br />The Capitol Police said his death would be investigated by the homicide branch of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, the Capitol Police and federal investigators. Prosecutors are also exploring the possibility of federal charges in connection with the death.<br />The youngest of three sons born in South River, N.J., Mr. Sicknick had wanted to be a police officer his entire life, according to a statement from his family. He joined the New Jersey Air National Guard, deploying to Saudi Arabia in 1999 and Kyrgyzstan in 2003, according to the Guard.<br />“Many details regarding Wednesday’s events and the direct causes of Brian’s injuries remain unknown and our family asks the public and the press to respect our wishes in not making Brian’s passing a political issue,” the family said in a statement provided by Mr. Sicknick’s brother, Ken. “Brian is a hero and that is what we would like people to remember.”</td>

The number of such crossings has fallen since the huge surge of migrants entering Europe in 2015.<br />The global pandemic has pushed down migration, both legal and illegal, as countries have closed borders, restricted routes for legal migration and scaled back programs to take in refugees. Covid-19 travel restrictions inside countries and along borders have also made smuggling more dangerous and expensive, experts said, although it hasn’t halted the activity altogether.<br />In Europe, the year started out with a surge in crossings from Turkey to Greece—a route used by Middle Eastern migrants and refugees, notably from Syria—but those numbers ultimately fell.<br />In February, the Turkish government signaled that it would no longer abide by a 2016 agreement it struck with the EU to stop large-scale migration.

      <td>Rising infections and new, highly contagious strains of the coronavirus are pressuring governments to accelerate vaccinations</td>
      <td>Countries around the world are accelerating their efforts to vaccinate their populations against Covid-19 in response to rising infections, public pressure, and fear of new, highly contagious variants of the coronavirus.<br />In an emerging race between the virus and vaccinations, some countries that previously took a cautious approach to authorizing and procuring vaccines, such as South Korea and Australia, are now bringing forward their timetables. Some other countries that were already pushing to inoculate swaths of their population quickly, such as the U.K. and Israel, are looking to further speed up their rollouts.<br />A year into the pandemic, the growing urgency behind vaccination programs shows how most of the world is still struggling to contain the virus with social-distancing measures alone. Stubbornly high infections, pressure on hospitals, public weariness with restrictions on everyday life and fear of accumulating economic damage are prompting many governments to hasten their vaccination plans. But in much of the world, ambitious timetables face obstacles including a shortage of available vaccine doses, logistical challenges and mixed levels of public willingness to get inoculated.<br />South Korea and Australia have brought forward the launch of their vaccination programs to February, about a month earlier than planned, in response to fresh outbreaks and concerns about the economic impact of rising contagion. Both countries were confident until recently they had tamed Covid-19 and therefore could afford to take time to authorize and distribute the new vaccines.<br />South Korea, seen as a model of how to limit contagion, took a particularly cautious approach to new vaccines last year, citing potential side effects and arguing that time was needed to negotiate better prices with pharmaceutical companies. After  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech  SE said in November their vaccine was 95% effective, South Korea’s health minister expressed surprise Pfizer had asked if the country wanted to place an order. It didn’t for weeks.</td>

      <td>From the 2020 primaries to the post-election furor, the founders’ system of election by states proved its democratic value.</td>
      <td>Scholars, pundits and progressives widely despise the Electoral College. They think it antiquated, irrational and undemocratic and argue for scrapping it in favor of a national popular vote.<br />But in 2020, when many hallowed American institutions submitted to street demonstrations and violence, the Electoral College proved a steadfast guardian of democracy. It can’t solve our problems on its own, but has given us a measure of stability to try for ourselves. A national popular election in 2020 would have made our problems immeasurably worse.<br />The essential feature of the Electoral College is voting for president by states. Each state has electoral votes equal to its delegation in the U.S. Congress—representatives (one for Vermont, 14 for Michigan, 53 for California, etc.) plus two senators. State legislatures determine the “manner” of casting their electoral votes, and 48 of them allocate those votes on a winner-take-all basis to the national ticket that receives the highest state popular vote. Maine and Nebraska select two electors by statewide vote and the remainder by congressional district.<br />As part of this design, states manage presidential elections along with those for other offices. They establish standards and procedures for voter eligibility, candidate ballot listing, mail-in voting, vote counting, challenges and recounts. The Constitution sets Inauguration Day as Jan. 20; federal statutes set a uniform Election Day in early November and a careful sequence of intermediate dates—for states to certify their election results and cast their electoral votes in December, and for their receipt by a joint session of Congress Jan. 6. To be elected president, a candidate must receive a majority of the electoral votes—at least 270 of the total 538.<br />Electoral votes are cast individually by electors, who gather in their state capitals in December. The Constitution’s framers conceived of electors as intermediaries between voters and candidates, but political parties soon assumed this role, choosing party stalwarts as electors pledged to their candidates. That has made the Electoral College assemblies largely ceremonial (there have been occasional “faithless electors,” but states can replace or penalize them). Still, newspapers ran many stories about electors who trekked to their state capitals to cast their votes on Dec. 14—diligently engaged in a constitutional practice that runs back to the election of George Washington in 1789.</td>

      <td>After nearly a year of vacation deprivation, frustrated globe-trotters are starting to dream about traveling freely again. We highlight six getaway goals for 2021 and new ways to realize each one.</td>
      <td>LINDA LAU IS looking forward to being jet-lagged as hell, sipping soju and dining at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Seoul with a bunch of strangers. This October, she hopes to attend the kickoff dinner of a “culinary retreat” to South Korea that she was supposed to take in fall 2020—that is, before the pandemic stopped travel cold. The rollout of Covid vaccines is giving her—and many of us—confidence to begin planning trips again. In a survey conducted in December 2020 by research firm Destination Analysts, over 53% of U.S. respondents said the vaccine made them optimistic that they can travel safely within the next six months; more than 80% said they have “at least tentative” plans right now.<br />Getting vaccinated, however, shouldn’t be seen as an immediate passport back to our former easygoing travel habits, cautions Dr. Lin Chen, president of the International Society of Travel Medicine and director of the Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. “There’s a little bit of data that suggests we may have reduced ability to transmit or carry” the virus, post vaccination, said Dr. Chen, “but it’s not enough.” More encouraging data may emerge, but, for now, even vaccinated travelers who hit the road before herd immunity is achieved—which Dr. Chen hopes might happen by fall in some regions—should continue to take precautions. That means wearing masks, distancing and observing other safety measures to protect the unvaccinated and the vulnerable.<br />Still, planning abounds. Troy Haas, president and CEO of Birmingham, Ala.-based Brownell Travel, sees people making travel arrangements as a form of self-care. “People just want the ability to find small ways to draw some joy back into life with travel and human connection,” he said. “Travel is a drink of water in a parched life.”<br />Here, we present six typical goals this year—from planning a getaway with the extended family to fleeing the pod for some overdue time alone—plus a few suggestions on how to achieve them. And since the international travel landscape could change dramatically in the coming months, we also offer a few domestic travel options. Even if you’re not ready to commit to vacation plans just yet, the following should help quench some of that travel thirst.<br />The Goal Zoom calls with the extended family are growing tiresome. Your first priority is getting the whole gang back together in the flesh.</td>

      <td>The ratification debates of 1787-88 were colored by ‘patriotic enthusiasms’ verging on violent chaos.</td>
      <td>What should statesmen do when public passions go awry? On Jan. 6, pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol, breaking windows, interrupting the certification of the 2020 election results, and forcing the evacuation of lawmakers. The chaotic scene turned tragic when one person was shot and killed in the melee. This was unquestionably an example of unhinged enthusiasm, of passions run amok.<br />Immanuel Kant once remarked that nothing great has ever been done without passion. But passion, when improperly managed, can do great harm. During the debates over the ratification of the Constitution in 1787-88, the Federalists sought to manage public enthusiasm by enlisting passion on the side of reason. They did so to unify the nation. And we can learn from them.<br />Americans like to think that the writing and ratification of the Constitution consisted of calm reflection and choice. But the ratification debates were, as the scholar Michael Faber recently put it, a “knock-down, drag-out fight.”<br />Elbridge Gerry, a delegate at the Federal Convention who refused to sign the Constitution, was burned in effigy in Massachusetts. George Mason of Virginia, who also withheld his signature, was encouraged by the mayor of Alexandria to leave town shortly after his arrival, given the great threat to his personal safety. Mobs forced Anti-Federalists in Pennsylvania to return to the state Assembly and hurriedly set a date for the state’s ratifying convention.<br />The Anti-Federalist Richard Henry Lee wrote to Samuel Adams, expressing disappointment that “the Agitators of this new system” were resorting to mob violence to rush the ratification of the Constitution, “as if the subject of Government were a business of passion, instead of cool, sober, and intense consideration.”</td>

Then, cold December weather triggered another big increase in joblessness.<br />December’s 140,000 drop in payrolls was the first since April. But unlike in April, December’s job losses were concentrated in the leisure and hospitality industries, said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at job site ZipRecruiter.</td>

      <td>At 84, the British artist surveys his career as a satirist and ‘Gonzo’ partner of writer Hunter S. Thompson.</td>
      <td>The British illustrator Ralph Steadman often begins a picture with a splat of ink on a white page. “It’s a very positive way of making a mark,” he says. “I can spread ink out easier than I can oil, and I can splash and blot, which I like to do.” Mr. Steadman’s spontaneous and satirical approach to caricature found a perfect corollary in the raucous prose of the American journalist Hunter S. Thompson. Together, artist and writer produced a body of work in magazine articles and books that became known as “Gonzo” for its unhinged subjectivity and anti-authoritarian outlook.<br />Mr. Steadman’s famed illustrations for “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,” Thompson’s autobiographical 1971 novel about his drug-fueled adventures, are a mixture of grotesque portraiture and geometrically precise landscape. A car driven by two screaming lunatics careens across a desert consisting of horizontal lines and a few felt-tip cactuses. In the distance, the looming skyscrapers that herald their Las Vegas destination are depicted by dozens of tightly packed vertical lines of differing lengths.<br />Now 84, Mr. Steadman, looks back on his career as a cartoonist in “A Life In Ink,” an illustrated memoir published by Chronicle Chroma in November. He credits the precision of his draughtsmanship to his time as an apprentice aircraft engineer in the 1950s. “I had to do endless circles and straight lines and that’s where that comes from in my illustrations,” he says. He still favors the same kind of steel-nibbed pens dipped into an inkpot that he used then.<br />Artistically, Mr. Steadman says that one of his most enduring influences is the Surrealist Marcel Duchamp. “It was his thinking out of context that interested me,” he says. “What I liked was Duchamp’s rather bland but comic sensibility, like taking a stool and attaching a bicycle wheel to the top of it.” In “A Life in Ink,” he attributes a different kind of influence to the headmaster of the school that he attended while growing up in Wales, “a hideous monster of a man that carried a cane” and left Mr. Steadman with an abiding mistrust of authority figures.<br />The young artist sold his first cartoon to the Manchester Evening Chronicle in 1956 and was soon being published in British humor magazines such as Punch and Private Eye. In 1969, the first book collection of his work, “Still Life with Raspberry,” launched his career in the U.S. He first collaborated with Thompson in 1970, when the two covered the Kentucky Derby for a short-lived magazine, Scanlan’s Monthly.</td>

      <td>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) is threatening impeachment again. But as with her last Trump impeachment, she faces a challenge in defining the charges.<br />At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, President Trump said in a Thursday night video that “like all Americans I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem” at the Capitol this week. He said to those who broke the law, “You will pay.” He also called for “healing and reconciliation”  and promised an orderly transition. But this morning Mr. Trump missed yet another opportunity to make the transition a gracious one. Mr. Trump tweeted:<br />Meanwhile on Thursday President-elect Joe Biden also was not in a mood for reconciliation and healing. In a litany of complaints about the current President, Mr. Biden bizarrely included a claim that Mr. Trump had been unreasonable to criticize the intelligence community—the same intelligence community that helped cast a yearslong cloud over his presidency by including with an official intelligence assessment the bogus Steele dossier of Trump-Russia accusations funded by the Clinton campaign. Said Mr. Biden:<br />Dared to tell the truth?

      <td>His firm applies an edible, plant-based coating to fruits and vegetables that lets them last longer without refrigeration</td>
      <td>Growing up in Battle Ground, Wash., James Rogers wanted to be an inventor. He spent weekends at the local hardware store sorting through buckets of odds and ends, moved by the idea that he could use ordinary materials to make something new. “I didn’t know then that that was science,” he says over Zoom from his home in Santa Barbara, Calif.<br />Some 25 years since those afternoons with his “invention journal,” Mr. Rogers, 35, is now promoting a scientific discovery that could improve the global food-supply chain. His company, Apeel, applies an edible, plant-based coating to fruits and vegetables that extends their shelf life without refrigeration.<br />Apeel-treated avocados, limes, apples and cucumbers are already in some of the largest grocery chains in the U.S. and Europe. The startup now plans to expand into markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America, thanks to a $30 million investment from the International Finance Corp., the World Bank’s private-sector arm. The company Mr. Rogers launched in 2012 as a Ph.D. student is now valued at more than $1 billion.<br />“Perishability governs every element of the food system,” Mr. Rogers says. Fruits and vegetables start to lose their value once they are picked, and producers, suppliers, retailers and consumers all race to get those berries and leaves into someone’s mouth before they spoil.<br />This urgency forces trade-offs. Most retailers arrange produce in unrefrigerated displays, which sells food faster but ensures that everything rots sooner. Asparagus turns so quickly that most international imports come by air, which gives these tender spears a larger carbon footprint than pork or veal, according to a study in the Journal of Industrial Ecology.</td>

      <td>Last month I began a desperate search for the black cotton T-shirts I have been wearing for years. I did this because my present stock of T-shirts was getting faded and raggedy—but also because I am trying to support the retail sector of this country in its hour of need.<br />For reasons that are not clear, my local department stores did not have the black T-shirts in stock, only the white ones. Eventually I hit on the obvious solution and decided to order the shirts online, directly from the manufacturer. But at some point in the payment process, I made the fatal decision to surrender my email address, so that the manufacturer could alert me to massive discounts and flash sales.<br />At first, even the manufacturer did not have the size or color I wanted, so I put the whole project aside. In a few hours, I received a message basically asking “Did you forget something?” Just in that short time, my size and color had come in, so I ordered a half-dozen. The price was not great, nor was the shipping, but the shirts did arrive in a few days, and I could finally toss the old ones into the trash and congratulate myself on a job well done.<br />That’s when the emails really started coming. At all hours of the night and day, they would whisper to me—or scream. 25% off. 40% off! Free shipping. 25% off and free shipping! Last chance for 75% off and free shipping!!<br />I like being alerted to fantastic discounts on quality merchandise. And free shipping. I really do. The problem is, there is only so much underwear that any one person can wear at any one time.</td>

      <td>Tommy Lasorda, the Hall of Fame manager whose colorful personality and boundless enthusiasm for his beloved Los Angeles Dodgers made him one of baseball’s most popular ambassadors and icons in Southern California and beyond, died late Thursday.<br />Lasorda had been hospitalized in mid-November and returned home earlier this week, before suffering a sudden cardiopulmonary arrest, the Dodgers said. He was 93.<br />Lasorda spent more than 70 years with the Dodgers, beginning as a pitcher when the franchise still played in Brooklyn and ending as an adviser in the front office. He was best known for his time in the dugout, where he managed the Dodgers from 1976 to 1996, winning four National League pennants and two World Series. His last championship came in 1988—thanks in part to Kirk Gibson’s legendary home run off Dennis Eckersley in Game 1—a victory that stood as the Dodgers’ most recent title until just last season.<br />Lasorda assumed an executive role after he retired as manager, but he often seemed more like an unofficial cheerleader for his favorite team and the sport he adored. He once said that he loved doubleheaders, because, “That way I get to keep my uniform on longer.”<br />As a manager, Lasorda was often praised for his leadership qualities and relentless optimism, an attitude he used to inspire his players. He was loquacious and quotable, allowing him to maintain a full schedule as a pitchman, charity booster and motivational speaker. Asked once to describe his managerial philosophy, he responded, “Contented cows give better milk.” He cited Ralph Houk, one of his minor-league managers, as his inspiration, telling a biographer, “Ralph taught me that if you treat players like human beings, they will play like Superman.”</td>

Trump administration officials said other lenders would follow soon after, but didn’t specify when.<br />Congress last month authorized $284 billion to provide forgivable loans to small businesses as part of its broader, $900 billion coronavirus relief bill. The new iteration of PPP will be far smaller than the original, which doled out $525 billion between April and August, and more narrowly focused on smaller businesses that can demonstrate need.<br />The program’s reopening comes at a crucial time for many small businesses that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic’s economic fallout and a resurgence in cases this winter. The National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business advocacy group, conducted a survey of its membership in early December and found that 45% of nearly 600 respondents would apply or reapply for a PPP loan if the program were to reopen.</td>

      <td>Fearing the competition for women patients, physicians barred the door to female doctors—until the Blackwells wrenched it open.</td>
      <td>America in the mid-19th century was rampant with many varieties of uncontrolled disease, while the art of medicine was at best rudimentary and at worst likely to kill. Doctors treated typhus by prescribing copious drafts of brandy and, when that failed, by rubbing the patient’s inner thighs with cayenne pepper. For ladies afflicted with gynecological ailments, standard remedies included arsenic, mustard poultices, leeches and fizzy lemonade.<br />City hospitals of the time had evolved from poorhouses and served as final refuges for the destitute. Often unheated and always overcrowded, they were more successful at spreading illness than at curing it. Sepsis and cholera tore through the wards, while resident physicians rotated daily through surgeries, childbirths and postmortems without washing their hands. Babies commonly died; children who survived had good odds of succumbing later to tuberculosis, influenza, typhoid fever and a host of other contagions whose means of transmission no one yet understood.<br />To qualify as a doctor in America during that pestilential era required alarmingly less effort than in such European capitals as Edinburgh or Paris, whose medical schools were more sophisticated. In 1869, the president of Harvard University, Charles Eliot, issued this warning: “The whole system of medical education in this country needs thorough reformation. The ignorance and general incompetency of the average graduate of the American medical Schools, at the time when he receives the degree which turns him loose upon the community, is something horrible to contemplate.”<br />Eliot was not exaggerating. Admission to medical school was nearly automatic for anyone who could scrape up the fees. During an initial term of 16 weeks, students were allowed to attend each lecture only after buying a ticket. During a second 16-week session, they attended the identical lectures and paid again. Between the two terms they tried to find some way to observe a doctor in practice. That was it. Rare was the student who examined a living patient or handled any instrument other than the pen he used for lecture notes. A fortunate few might chance upon a cadaver with which to attempt a dissection, but there were no guarantees. New physicians often received their diplomas without having gained any experience at all.<br />Aside from tuition fees, there was one other impediment to entering this slapdash enclave: You had to be a man. Women could be nurses, midwives or “doctresses”—ill-reputed purveyors of snake oil and abortifacients—but the notion of a licensed female physician was unimaginable.</td>

      <td>Though he was overshadowed by his charismatic bandmates, Chris Hillman wanted to be a rock ’n’ roll star too.</td>
      <td>Chris Hillman has always been happy to be second-in-command, a role he explores in his memoir “Time Between: My Life as a Byrd, Burrito Brother, and Beyond.” As the shy Mr. Hillman tried to blend into the background at a London party in 1965, John Lennon nodded toward him and asked the others, “Does he talk?”<br />Mr. Hillman never shared the name recognition or charisma of Byrds co-founders Roger McGuinn and David Crosby, and though he was a founding member of the Flying Burrito Brothers, it’s the doomed genius and eternal youth of Gram Parsons that people remember. Mr. Hillman is front and center on the cover of “Manassas,” a genre-bending glory of the early ’70s, but it was Stephen Stills’s band. For a brief period later, in the wake of CSNY, when every band was a potential supergroup, he found his name above the title, but “The Souther-Hillman-Furay Band” and “McGuinn, Clark & Hillman” never tripped readily off the tongue. He later found the country charts with the Desert Rose Band and made a string of excellent solo albums, the most recent of which, “Bidin’ My Time” (2017), was the final production of fan Tom Petty.<br />Yet seconds-in-command aren’t also-rans. Mr. Hillman, a Rock & Roll Hall of Famer with four Grammy nominations to his name, has as solid a claim as anyone—though he modestly does not make it—to have invented the entire genre of country rock. His early bluegrass contributions to the Byrds found their apotheosis in 1968’s “Sweetheart of the Rodeo,” which has become latterly influential, a wellspring of today’s alt-country movement. By that time, Mr. Hillman had emerged both as a songwriter (including the classic “So You Want to Be a Rock ’n’ Roll Star”) and a singer: the secret of the Byrds’ vocal chemistry was not three-part harmony but that two sang in unison as Mr. Crosby soared above.<br />The first 50 pages of “Time Between” detail a Southern California upbringing in San Diego County’s then-rural Rancho Santa Fe: a succession of dogs and horses vie with the sequential appeal of TV cowboys, scooters and surfing until music starts calling the tune. The suicide of Mr. Hillman’s father—on which he blames much of his hot temper—marks the end of this idyllic childhood; his future lay north in L.A., via fledgling bluegrass bands with wondrous period names like the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers. Then, “like that moment in The Wizard of Oz when everything goes from black and white to color,” the Beatles play Ed Sullivan. Mr. Hillman auditions for the Byrds on electric bass, despite being a mandolin picker who has never played even a double bass, and immediately finds himself in a Hollywood of almost mythical glamour for the band’s 1965 residency on the Sunset Strip at Ciro’s Le Disc, a scene on the cusp: so recently the haunt of Spencer Tracy and Errol Flynn, now a hangout for Sonny & Cher.<br />The cutthroat mentality of a band on the make is tactfully told. Mr. Hillman, a longtime Christian who understands that it’s all about motes and beams, is as discreet about other people’s bad choices as he is about his own, and “Time Between” gives him a chance to reflect, make amends and give thanks. Those wanting gorier details of Mr. Crosby’s shenanigans, Mr. Stills’s control-freakery or Parsons’s drug abuse should look elsewhere.</td>

      <td>Where did America’s global dominance begin? In Stephen Wertheim’s view, look to the fall of France in 1940.</td>
      <td>How fast it was, really, for America to become No. 1. It took a mere five summers—so short a time in the grand sweep of Great Power politics—for a vague ambition held in the minds of a small group of American intellectuals before 1940 to become the firm grand strategy of the Republic by June 1945. One month earlier than that, in May, the Supreme Allied Commander of the West’s forces in Europe, five-star American Army Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, had accepted the Nazi surrender. Six thousand miles away, and only a few weeks later, the nations of the free world met to sign the U.N. Charter in San Francisco and formed a new international order very much along American lines. Even as that historic event was happening, the President of the United States was preparing, confidently, to further arrange the world’s future at Potsdam. And while Harry Truman was sailing back from Europe after the Potsdam Conference, he ordered the dropping of the first atomic bomb upon a distant, battered Japan. This was world power as had never been seen before; little wonder that both its supporters and its few remaining doubters shook their heads in awe. Was this not, indeed, manifest destiny?<br />For almost 80 years now, historians and diplomats have sought not only to describe America’s swift advance to global primacy but also to explain it, and the sheer number of contending schools of thought—patriotic, revisionist, realist, liberal-internationalist—is not surprisingly very large. Any writer wanting to make a novel contribution either has to have evidence for a new interpretation, or at least be making an older argument in some improved and eye-catching way. Stephen Wertheim’s “Tomorrow, the World” does both. The book is a re-statement, in a more sophisticated form, of the old left-wing claim that the rising U.S. internationalism of this time was a cloak for ambitious quasi-imperialist policies. But the text also presents “new” archival materials, and uses them to advance a seriously original claim about exactly when and why the transformation occurred.<br />Mr. Wertheim, a historian at Columbia University and Deputy Director of Research and Policy at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, takes his first bold step by presenting the argument that it was not Pearl Harbor and events in the Pacific in late 1941 that pulled America out of isolationism, but rather the shocking fall of France in June 1940. Previous scholarship has hardly ignored the impact upon American politics of the seismic shaking of the Atlantic world that summer and autumn, and the rush of U.S. measures to shore up its own security (the naval Acts, the destroyer-bases deal). But no historian before Mr. Wertheim has shown in such detail how a small, networked bunch of Ivy League-elite public intellectuals and strategists—Rhodes scholars galore and underwritten by the Rockefeller Foundation—could step in and use the shock of France’s fall to articulate their visions of the path forward for the American Republic from their posts at such organizations as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Yale Institute for International Studies and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. Acting as the State Department’s virtual “think tank” for the country’s future, the CFR and the many planning sub-groups it spawned stepped forward to convince important senators, the broader Congress, the American newspapers and the public at large that their nation should now assume the many burdens of global leadership. For if the United States would not stop the Fascist threat to world domination, who else could? Their interventionist and Atlanticist drumbeat was loud, then, even before Pearl Harbor gave these folks the chance to push the country into the role they wanted to assume in any case.<br />Mr. Wertheim’s second, even bolder argument is that virtually all these intellectuals took America’s greatness for granted. Whether they were of the harder-nosed “realist” tradition (like University of Chicago professor Hans Morgenthau and Yale professor Nicholas Spykman), or advocates of a new United Nations-based security architecture (like professors James T. Shotwell and Leo Pasvolsky), all of them held that global leadership was their birthright. Because America was an inherently “good thing,” the world and the world-system American made could only benefit when the country acted in its own best interests. America’s good was the planet’s good, and vice-versa. Only by the end of 1945—after the atomic bombs, the carve-up of Europe at the Potsdam conference, and the spread of America’s military footprint across the globe—did a few American voices remain (the thoughtful political scientists Quincy Wright was one) to wonder whether the nation was embracing too much the world of raw power-politics.<br />Given the ambitious title and subtitle, ”The Birth of U.S. Global Supremacy,” of Mr. Wertheim’s book, though, it is important to understand what it is not about. While the striking dust-jacket shows that famous 1943 modernist poster of aircraft, warships and tanks advancing out of American factories, “Tomorrow the World” is not about the creation of the U.S. military-industrial complex, nor is it much interested in the story of the emergence of American financial dominance over the rest of the world (the U.S. Treasury, tellingly, is not in the index). The planners and strategists in and around the State Department, and the academics and public intellectuals of the CFR, all took the untrammeled American economic and military might for granted. They did not bother much about how or even where the U.S. armed forces fought the war, or the tough strategy debates about a second front, or the type of weapons systems deployed to defeat Japan. The important role of the formidable Adm. Ernest J. King, whose Navy took over the entire Pacific realm, is not covered here, nor is that of Hap Arnold, the architect of American global air power. Roosevelt’s closest military aide, his confidante Adm. William D. Leahy, described in a recent biography as “The Second Most Powerful Man in the World,” has no entry in the index; nor, remarkably, does the Secretary of War Henry Stimson. Yet, by contrast, the realist thinker Spykman gets a lot of mention, and internationalist Quincy Wright even more. Significantly, the Council on Foreign Relations itself gets the most coverage, and more pages, than any other subject in this book. After all, “Tomorrow, the World” is a study in American foreign-policy thinking, not in the actual wielding and making of American power. This is intellectual history, in the broadest sense of that term.</td>

      <td>Radical abolitionists saw the Constitution as poisoned by slavery. Could it instead be a tool in the hands of liberators?</td>
      <td>An early version of what became the 13th Amendment—the amendment that abolished slavery throughout the country—would have protected slavery in any state where it existed. Framed on the eve of the Civil War, the so-called Corwin Amendment passed both houses of Congress in March 1861 with two-thirds majorities and received the endorsement of the incoming president, Abraham Lincoln. This obscure fact seems incompatible with the moral conflict at stake in the war that quickly followed. If Republicans were willing to deny the federal government the power to abolish slavery, why did the South bother to secede?<br />James Oakes’s “The Crooked Path to Abolition” provides an effective answer to this question. As shocking as the Corwin Amendment seems today, it merely expressed what was already “implied constitutional law,” as Abraham Lincoln himself explained. Virtually everyone, including abolitionists, agreed that the federal government had no constitutional authority to abolish slavery directly.<br />Instead, as Mr. Oakes relates, antislavery radicals developed an elaborate strategy for attacking slavery indirectly, exploiting powers that the Constitution already granted. First and foremost, Congress could prohibit the admission of any new slave states, a move that would alter the sectional equilibrium in favor of freedom. Second, Congress could abolish slavery in every jurisdiction over which it possessed sovereign jurisdiction, including the nation’s capital. Third, Congress could use its authority over commerce to eliminate the interstate slave trade, thus eviscerating the slave economy and limiting one of its cruelest dimensions. Fourth, Congress could recognize free blacks as American citizens and insist on due-process rights for fugitive slaves. Finally, the federal government could use its control over patronage to promote the antislavery cause within Southern states.<br />Antebellum slaveholders considered each of these possibilities a fatal threat to their social order, and after Lincoln was elected in 1860 they demanded guarantees against them.. Lincoln and the Republicans refused. As an alternative, in what the South considered a false gesture of goodwill, they disavowed the one threat—the direct abolition of slavery by the federal government—that no reasonably informed Southerner actually feared. The result was war.<br />Mr. Oakes, a distinguished Civil War historian and a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, describes the development of these constitutional antislavery strategies concisely and clearly. At just over 200 pages, his book contains more insightful analysis than countless massive tomes on the antislavery movement. Indeed, historians have generally slighted the strategies that Mr. Oakes emphasizes in favor of the absolutist position taken by the radical abolitionist movement, whose most prominent champion was William Lloyd Garrison.</td>

      <td>The novel ‘Hatchet’ set a boy in the wilderness. In a new memoir, the author shares his own gripping journey.</td>
      <td>In Gary Paulsen’s acclaimed 1986 novel, “Hatchet,” a boy gets stranded alone in the Canadian wilderness after a plane crash. Equipped only with his wits and a small hatchet, the boy, Brian Robeson, struggles to find sustenance, make fire, and build a shelter while contending with wild animals and the implacable elements. Necessity compels the boy to focus on what is immediate, those moment-to-moment decisions that will determine whether he lives or starves; only rarely can he step back and contemplate the raw beauty of his surroundings. It all feels authentic. As with Jack London, another chronicler of persistence in harsh environments, we can tell with Gary Paulsen that he writes from experience—that he has faced hardships and has had to be resourceful.<br />Even so, many readers may be shocked to learn the harrowing nature of Mr. Paulsen’s tutorial in the school of life; how close a thing it was that he ever grew to be literate, let alone a full-grown man. Now in his 80s, Mr. Paulsen presents an unflinching account of his early years in “Gone to the Woods” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 357 pages $17.99), a memoir that contains moments of searing trauma that are leavened only by the abiding wonder of the author’s survival.<br />Mr. Paulsen doesn’t tarry: By the second page, readers ages 9-16 know that his mother left her family’s Minnesota farm during World War II, moved to Chicago to take a factory job and became a drunk. She would bring her son along to bars and get him to dance on tabletops and sing. Four-year-old Gary liked that, because the beery men would cheer. He liked less certain episodes, obliquely referenced here, that suggest sloppy scenes when his mother brought her admirers home.<br />And then, suddenly—which is how adult resolution feels to children—he was out of it and on a train alone, all of 5, traveling to stay with his Aunt Edy and Uncle Sig on a homestead full of hissing geese and ornery hens. For the child Gary—and for the writer the child would become—this was a formative time, for it was with Sig that he learned how hard he could work, how few words a man needed, and what glory there was in the wild. Mr. Paulsen recalls paddling a canoe with his uncle through an archway of trees, with dragonflies dancing all around, and having a revelation: “And there it was—the moment—the very split second, of all the minutes of all time the boy would ever have, that would never cease to exist. The moment—though he would not know it or understand it fully until he was an older man—when he would never again be able to, nor even want to, separate himself from nature. He had become folded into it; he had become an integral part of water and trees and birds and dragonflies. The moment was so pure, so profound, that he caught himself holding his breath.”<br />His idyll with Sig and Edy did not last long. Mr. Paulsen’s mother turned up and took the boy to the Philippines, where his father was serving in the U.S. military. Neglect seems to have been an art form with this couple, for by the time he was 7 Gary Paulsen was scavenging for food on the bomb-blown streets of Manila. Worse was to come. There are scenes in “Gone to the Woods” that linger and appall, so it might seem unlikely that such an unflinching account could have an uplifting effect. Yet it does. A child may grow up in privation, and he may grow up in ease, but suffering comes to all. Through his example, Gary Paulsen models how it can be overcome.</td>

      <td>With his last work, Winston Groom brings to life the acrimonious split between former friends.</td>
      <td>Fake news, partisan bickering and juvenile name-calling is nothing new in American politics. The election of 1800 was so savagely fought that it resulted in a deadly duel, a constitutional amendment and lifelong estrangement among the Founding Fathers. Whatever we might think of modern political discourse, present-day mud-slingers are relative amateurs when stacked against their 18th-century forebears.<br />Winston Groom, best known for his novel “Forrest Gump,” devoted the second half of his literary career to American history. His earlier nonfiction works usually focused on events, like the Battle of New Orleans (“Patriotic Fire”), Stephen Kearny’s Western adventures (“Kearny’s March”) and the American Civil War (“Shiloh, 1862,” “Vicksburg, 1863”)—though he also meandered into Alabama football (“The Crimson Tide”), World War I (“A Storm in Flanders”) and presidential biography (“Ronald Reagan”).<br />In his final decade, Groom’s pen shifted to triangular relationships among military leaders. “The Aviators” covered the airplane’s rise through the eyes of Eddie Rickenbacker, Jimmy Doolittle and Charles Lindbergh. “The Generals” looked at George Patton, Douglas MacArthur and George C. Marshall. “The Allies” went a step higher, painting an entertaining portrait of the Big Three—Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin—as they crushed the Nazis and built a world that lasted half a century.<br />Continuing his study of political ménages à trois, Groom steps back to the nation’s birth with “The Patriots: Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and the Making of America.” Released two months after his death in September, “Patriots” is a synthesis of archived letters, popular biographies and colorful insights, with a nod or two to the Broadway hit “Hamilton.”<br />Groom reprises the formula he deployed for “Generals” and “Allies,” and begins with short biographies of his central characters. Hamilton’s unlikely rise from the poverty of St. Croix will strike a familiar note to fans of “Hamilton.” The Schuyler sisters, Lafayette, John Laurens and Maria Reynolds take their obligatory bows as Hamilton’s journey from trading clerk to Treasury secretary plays out.</td>

      <td>‘There are scullery maids and match girls disappearing left and right” in London’s Whitechapel district at the start of “The House on Vesper Sands” (Tin House, 403 pages, $26.95) by Paraic O’Donnell. It is 1893, so readers are primed to expect a fictional reprise of the Jack the Ripper murders carried out just years before. But the crimes here are occult in their nature. There are rumors that a shadowy sect of “Spiriters” are stealing the souls of psychically “gifted” young women—mostly poor and orphaned—whose vital essence is so potent that, to a perceptive few, they radiate light. The tale that Mr. O’Donnell spins from this premise is part boots-on-the-ground police procedural and part paranormal thriller.<br />Pitted against the Spiriters (led, naturally, by a deranged earl) are a crusading lady journalist, a pugnacious Scotland Yard inspector and a seminary student with a romantic attachment to the latest victim. The novel tracks their intersecting paths to the truth, building suspense until the dramatic payoff. There’s good fun in the investigations. The inspector and the student form an unlikely bond, a Victorian equivalent of buddy cops. There’s also some genre silliness, particularly when a villain wastes precious time explaining his nefarious plan to the captive journalist instead of just dispatching her.<br />One slightly ticklish issue is that the supernatural elements of “The House on Vesper Sands” are remarkably similar to those in David Mitchell’s recent fantasy novels “The Bone Clocks” and “Slade House,” in which evildoers gain immortality by feeding on the souls of “engifted” humans. (I believe that Mr. O’Donnell alludes to the influence in a brief digression about a “cloud atlas,” the title of Mr. Mitchell’s most famous book.)<br />Yet such concerns become quibbles once you’re ensconced in the rich, Gothic embellishments of Mr. O’Donnell’s prose. “At any time this place might have had a melancholy appearance, but the snow made it seem otherworldly,” he writes about a blizzard in run-down Whitechapel. “It had grown insistent now, swooning from the darkness above the bell tower and gathering in patient surges among the broken monuments. He had not considered it before, the way the solid world was made strange by snow, the quiet secrecy it brought to ordinary things.” “The House on Vesper Sands” performs a comparable kind of enchantment, transforming a chronicle of sordid crimes into an enjoyably eerie ghost story.<br />“Summerwater” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 203 pages, $25), the latest from the prolific English author Sarah Moss, takes place in a remote holiday park beside a Scottish loch. The vacationers there have opted for certain Spartan inconveniences: The weather is capricious, they can’t get Wi-Fi and there isn’t much privacy—the cottages clumped along the shore form a kind of panopticon where everyone can hear and observe their neighbors.</td>

      <td>By Kathleen Rooney (2017)<br />1. New Yorkers have a predictable habit of pegging the time of the city’s peak to whatever year they arrived, whether it’s 1965 or 2015. The elegant, unflappable Lillian Boxfish recalls most fondly the days during the Depression when she was at the height of her creativity as both a published poet and the highest-paid female advertising copywriter: a time when she churned out pithy copy for R.H. Macy’s and also threw the most marvelous of parties. Decades later, Lillian has lost none of her droll wit and remains undaunted as she slashes Helena Rubinstein Orange Fire on her lips and dons a mink coat for an odyssey downtown. It’s a quest that gives rise both to communion and needle-sharp observations. The window washers she sees look to her “as serene as buttercups.” On this cold winter’s night, the job long gone, her poetry collections out of print, Lillian seeks and finds delicious encounters with her fellow citizens, including one with a band of muggers that ends with her strolling away in a red leather flight jacket. She later reminisces on the choices that left her alone, yet not lonely. “So many careers and fortunes are made by expecting the least and the worst of people. And yet people are rarely so disappointing. The city has taught me that.”<br />By Geraldine Brooks (2008)<br />2. Geraldine Brooks conjures a fictionalized account of both the conception and the centuries-long preservation of the Hebrew codex known as the Sarajevo Haggadah—a treasure filled with lavish illustrations in saffron, malachite green, worm scarlet and gold leaf. Manuscript conservator Hanna Heath has discovered clues within its pages—a butterfly wing, a missing clasp, blood and wine stains—that lead to a series of stories within the story about the book’s survival and the heroism of those who kept it safe. “A book is more than the sum of its materials. It is an artifact of the human mind and hand. The gold beaters, the stone grinders, the scribes, the binders, those are the people I feel most comfortable with,” Hanna confesses. The history wends its way from the Spanish expulsion of Jews during the 15th century to the war-torn Sarajevo of the 1990s, with stops along the way in Barcelona, fin de siècle Vienna and Inquisition-era Venice—a silent witness to brave deeds and dark prejudices.<br />By James McBride (2002)</td>

      <td>Falling stars have always captured human imagination, but their rocky remains contain wonders in themselves.</td>
      <td>Struck with cosmic awe on the rocky, windswept summit of Maine’s Mount Katahdin, Henry David Thoreau asked in 1846: “Who are we? Where are we?”<br />Nearly two centuries later, British geologist Tim Gregory offers the best scientific answer I’ve yet found in his meticulously researched and eminently readable “Meteorite: How Stones from Outer Space Made Our World.” We are infinitesimally small “pieces of the Universe,” he writes, a “nebula come to life” whose “molecules evolved into minds” that miraculously “discovered the natural history of our Solar System and of ourselves.”<br />Since the dawn of Homo sapiens about 200,000 years ago, we’ve been addressing fundamental enigmas about our origins with myth, just-so stories and received wisdom. Only in the last 500 years, or so, though, have we been able to transcend our paleolithic mindsets to replace mystery with fact. The tool we use is science, a stepwise cognitive algorithm for making new information: observing, questioning, testing, concluding, communicating and repeating.<br />The ancient Greeks found answers in myth. The demigods Deucalion and Pyrrha, they said, created humans by throwing stones over their shoulders. In the modern scientific version, the atoms within our bodies fell to Earth in stones tossed over the sun’s shoulder. We call them meteorites, the rocky remains of asteroids that survive being burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere as part of the exploding streaks of light we call meteors.<br />Mr. Gregory, a specialist in the “wonderful and often bewildering field” of cosmochemistry at the University of Bristol, creates a gallery of science by hanging one gorgeous hypothesis after another on the walls. He writes with aplomb, his sentences backed by hard evidence and served with clarity, erudition and occasionally humor. “Mercury the scorched sphere, Venus the morning star, Earth the blue marble, and Mars the red planet. . . . Jupiter the giant, Saturn the graceful, Uranus the ice giant, and Neptune the bitterly cold.” Some pithy phrases, short and sweet, could be strung together as a poem to sum up the entire book:</td>
