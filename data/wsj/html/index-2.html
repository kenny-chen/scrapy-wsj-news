      <td>Autonomous trucking company TuSimple Inc., which gained momentum with hundreds of millions of dollars in financing from Chinese investors and U.S. freight-hauling companies, has filed paperwork to go public and plans to join the U.S. stock market as early as next month, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The company, which has offices in San Diego and China, has filed confidentially for an IPO and plans to make that filing public in early March and will list its shares for trading a few weeks later, the people said. That schedule is subject to change and market conditions could alter TuSimple’s plans.<br />Morgan Stanley  is the lead banker on the IPO, the people said. TuSimple said it raised $215 million in a 2019 financing round that valued it at $1.2 billion. It has since raised more capital but declined to share its latest valuation. Other financial details about the coming IPO weren’t immediately available.<br />A spokeswoman for TuSimple declined to comment on the company’s IPO plans.<br />The IPO filing confirms TuSimple’s intention to pursue a traditional public listing versus merging with a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which is also known as a blank-check company. Last year, TuSimple considered going public with a SPAC, people with knowledge of the discussions said.</td>

      <td>Small landlords that rely on rental income for their retirement are vulnerable to eviction bans</td>
      <td>Real estate has been touted by financial advisers as a stable investment for those seeking a passive source of income in retirement. But instead of boosting their income, some retirees who invested in residential rental properties are now losing money due to eviction moratoria resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Faced with tenants who can’t pay rent, these mom-and-pop landlords are finding their hands tied under the governmental orders, making them especially vulnerable and, in some cases, at risk of losing the properties securing their retirement.<br />Here’s what you need to know about the moratoria and what you can, and can’t, do when your tenants don’t pay.<br />In January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extended the existing eviction moratorium to March 31, 2021. This moratorium prevents landlords from evicting tenants for nonpayment, although tenants can still be evicted for reasons other than not paying rent. To be protected from eviction, tenants must provide a written declaration to their landlord, attesting that they have sought government rental assistance, will earn no more than $99,000 in annual income (or $198,000 if filing a joint tax return), cannot pay their full rent due to loss of income, work hours or extraordinary medical expenses, have used best efforts to make timely partial payments, and would become homeless if evicted. All rental properties are covered, but the CDC moratorium doesn’t apply in any state or local areas that have their own moratorium with the same or greater protection. In those areas, state or local law prevails.<br />Gregory Scott Brown, senior vice president, government affairs, of the National Apartment Association, says that if rent remains unpaid when the moratorium expires, landlords will still need to go through the eviction process to regain possession of their unit. Some eviction laws allow tenants to avoid eviction by paying off the rent debt and some judges in eviction proceedings decide if tenants are liable for back rent. They could rule that tenants don’t have to repay before eviction. Mr. Brown suggests that whenever possible, landlords try to work out a repayment plan with the tenant to keep them in place.<br />Don’t. Don’t shut off utilities either. “The only recourse to regain possession of a unit is through the courts and the eviction process,” says Bob Pinnegar, president and chief executive officer of the National Apartment Association. Take the law into your own hands, and you might be subject to civil or criminal penalties, depending on the jurisdiction. In New York, a court may even allow the tenant back into the apartment, says Howard Poch, a New York City attorney who represents landlords and tenants.</td>

Options activity tied to GameStop also hit the highest level in two weeks, with bullish contracts significantly outpacing bearish ones, Trade Alert data show.<br />A clear catalyst for the surge couldn’t be determined. The company said after markets closed Tuesday that its chief financial officer would resign March 26.<br />Other “meme” stocks—ones that are popular on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum—also jumped in offhours trading.

The operation has been described as one of the worst instances of cyber espionage in the nation’s history.<br />While cybersecurity experts say it is nearly impossible to prevent hackers from misusing cloud services, as is alleged to have occurred in this case, they also say that Amazon is likely sitting on critical information that could shed light on the scope of the attacks and the tactics used by the cybercriminals. U.S. authorities say the intruders are likely Russian intelligence agents.<br />Amazon has shared this information privately with the U.S. government, but unlike other technology companies, it has balked at making it public.</td>

In an ideal scenario, the brewer would be able to mop up some of the excess stock by buying them out, but high borrowings restrict its options.<br />On Thursday, the world’s biggest beer maker said sales in the three months through December increased by 4.5% compared with the same period of 2019, suggesting a continued recovery from the pandemic-related problems of last spring. However, AB InBev’s shares fell 5% in early trading as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization missed forecasts and management gave cautious guidance for 2021.<br />But there is another reason for investors to be wary about the brewer this year. In October, restrictions on the sale of shares worth around 17% of AB InBev’s market value will be lifted. The stock is mainly owned by Marlboro cigarette maker  Altria  and Colombia’s Santo Domingo family. Both were major shareholders in SABMiller when the Anglo-South African brewer was taken over by AB InBev in 2016. The duo opted for a mix of cash and shares in the combined company as payment, and agreed not to sell for five years.<br />At the time, it looked like a great deal. The two got stock in AB InBev at a 50% premium to SABMiller’s undisturbed share price in dollar terms, according to Bernstein analyst Trevor Stirling. However, as the brewer’s share price has more than halved since then, they are down in dollar terms today. The holding has been especially troublesome for Altria: AB InBev’s dividend cuts made the tobacco giant’s earnings volatile in recent years.</td>

That is an all-time high and up roughly eight million acres from last year—driven by a jump in soybean acreage, which is expected to rise nearly seven million acres from last year.<br />“If realized, this would approach the highest planted soybean area figure on record,” said Mac Marshall, vice president of market intelligence for the United Soybean Board. That record dates back to 2017, when farmers planted 90.2 million acres of soybeans, according to USDA data.<br />Behind the increase lies a sharp rise in soybean prices over the past eight months—69% since June 1, with the most-active contract on the Chicago Board of Trade trading at $14.26 per bushel on Wednesday, the highest level since July 2014.<br />Prices have been lifted by surging demand for U.S. soybeans in China, where the country continues to rebuild a hog herd that was decimated by African swine fever in 2019. As of last week, Chinese buyers had purchased 35.9 million tons of U.S. soybeans since the start of September—up nearly 24 million tons from the same period a year earlier.</td>

      <td>Golf can wait. In those early, gray moments Tuesday, when we didn’t know much about the accident involving Tiger Woods—when all we had was some harrowing overhead footage of a crumpled SUV off the side of a winding Southern California road—it was possible to really let your mind wander and worry. Now we know more: Woods is hurt, with broken bones in his right leg and foot, and now has a rod inserted after surgery, but overall, the news is good, very good, considering how it looked at first.<br />Still: golf can wait.<br />Priorities will shift. That’s what happens when something like this occurs. Attention will be paid to Woods’s recovery and rehabilitation, and there will naturally be curiosity about his potential return to his sport—short answer: nobody knows for sure—but his playing status feels like a minor diversion compared with the relief of the big picture. Woods is lucky, and those of us who have loved watching him play golf have to feel a little lucky, too.<br />The sport can wait. “When Tiger wants to talk about golf, we’ll talk about golf,” the PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said.<br />That sounds like the right perspective. There will be a compulsion to accelerate things: that’s our culture, hurry it along, speculate without all of the information, and turn someone else’s life into a daily drama for our own entertainment. There’s going to be a temptation to draw parallels to golf great Ben Hogan’s wreck and recovery, and even though it’s a very different time and set of circumstances, we won’t be able to help ourselves. This has always been a media affliction, but now it’s everywhere. We want it when we want it, and we’re all terribly impatient for clean narratives and quick answers.</td>

      <td>Strain first detected in Britain last year has been found in more than 70 countries, including the U.S.</td>
      <td>LONDON—The U.K. has become a testing ground for how a more-contagious and possibly deadlier coronavirus variant spreads through communities, displacing its less-transmissible ancestors and complicating vaccine rollouts and the lifting of lockdowns.<br />The variant has now been identified in more than 70 countries and 40 U.S. states, and its advance in Britain could help scientists understand its likely trajectory in the U.S. These charts show the spread of the variant around the U.K. and what British scientists are learning about it—including its higher transmissibility and lethality.<br />“Increasingly, since this version of the virus was discovered we’ve really been running two separate pandemics,” said Jason Leitch, national clinical director for Scotland. “That is a warning to other countries.”<br />British scientists detected the new variant in November, and in early December traced its first appearance in the U.K. to the southern English county of Kent, in September. The country was in lockdown in November to suppress a deadly wave of infection that had been building since the fall. British public health officials were mystified by the virus’s ongoing spread in southern England despite those restrictions.<br />When scientists examined the variant’s genome, they found an unusually large number of mutations, some of which pointed to the possibility the new variant could spread more rapidly than pre-existing versions. Further sequencing—and a testing quirk that served as a reliable proxy for the variant’s presence—revealed how quickly the variant rose to dominance.</td>

Vanguard Group is betting more singularly on the Chinese consumer.<br />The Malvern, Pa., firm told some of China’s biggest state investors last year that it would exit its China institutional business and return the billions of dollars managed for them. Instead, the world’s second-largest asset manager is relying on a partnership with Ant Group Co., China’s biggest digital financial firm and an affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., as a main route into China.<br />Vanguard hopes the venture will give it reach to the roughly one billion users of Ant’s payments service, Alipay—and perhaps a channel to sell Vanguard’s funds later. This move plays to a broader growth plan for Vanguard.<br />The firm that built a $7.2 trillion asset-management empire on the back of low-cost index funds is betting growth will come from dispensing financial advice at a fraction of rivals’ prices.<br />But, as Vanguard looks to expand in China, Chief Executive Tim Buckley must also convince Beijing that his firm is as committed to the country as rivals, even after it recently turned away business from some of its big state institutions. Vanguard must also deal with a recent complication: Ant is now revamping its entire business after being warned by Beijing regulators about some of its practices and having its initial public offering scrapped.</td>

      <td>Americans drinking more hard seltzer through the pandemic helped beer giant  Anheuser-Busch InBev SA  partly offset a continuing slump in sales of Budweiser and Bud Light.<br />Hard seltzers—essentially flavored alcoholic sparkling water—have emerged as one of the hottest parts of the booze market in recent years, tempting more health-conscious drinkers away from beer. In response, AB InBev launched Bud Light Seltzer early last year, has since invested in several new flavors of the brand and recently rolled out Michelob Ultra Hard Seltzer.<br />On Thursday, the world’s biggest brewer said those efforts were paying off, as sales at its “beyond beer” unit, which includes hard seltzer, ready-to-drink cocktails and other products, grew double digits to top over $1 billion.<br />That helped AB InBev report overall fourth-quarter sales growth on an organic basis—which strips out currency moves and acquisitions and divestitures—of 4.5%. Revenue on a reported basis dropped to $12.77 billion from $13.33 billion a year earlier. Net profit jumped to $2.27 billion from $114 million a year earlier, when results were hit by higher finance costs.<br />AB InBev was late to jump on the seltzer wagon, originally driven mainly by White Claw, owned by Mike’s Hard Lemonade Co., and Truly Spiked & Sparkling, made by  Boston Beer Co.  Now, though, the drinks giant sees seltzers as a priority and key way to win back defecting beer drinkers. It said Thursday that its hard seltzer brands grew at double the rate of the industry last year, helped by the launch of Bud Light Seltzer.</td>

Meanwhile, business continues to be slow; companies have lately reported comparable sales declines on the order of 12% to 22% from a year earlier.<br />There was a sound logic for investors to look past the business weakness. Wall Street typically doesn’t give much weight to one-time financial events, and the impact of a global pandemic would seem to be the mother of such one-time situations. Big chains have also been able to access cheap financing to help get through the lean months. A reopening after months of closed dining rooms means there should be significant pent-up demand, at least in theory. That moment could be coming soon: About 45 million Americans have received at least one dose of a vaccine, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.<br />Meanwhile, consumers have plenty of cash to spend on an evening out, and fresh stimulus checks could soon be on the way. As a bonus, the need to adapt to a socially distanced business model resulted in better off-premise sales models and other investments that should pay off down the road. Massive industrywide comparable sales growth seems likely in the months ahead.</td>

      <td>Employers say eliminating $2.13-an-hour subminimum wage for workers receiving tips could cost jobs and raise prices; plan’s advocates say it would provide consistent income</td>
      <td>How restaurants pay workers would be upended by President Biden’s proposal to raise the minimum wage.<br />The plan, under consideration in Congress, would lift the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from the current level of $7.25 an hour for all workers that has been in place since 2009. The proposal also would eliminate a subminimum wage of as little as $2.13 an hour for millions of workers such as servers or bartenders who receive tips. Both changes would be phased in over several years and largely eliminate a patchwork of state wage laws.<br />In most states, businesses can pay tipped workers less than others, so long as those employees earn at least the minimum wage after tips are added. Under the proposal, restaurants in 32 states could have increased direct labor costs of between $10 and $13 an hour, with businesses in several more states facing increases of $5 to $10 an hour. Seven states, including California, don’t have a subminimum wage for tipped workers.<br />Worker advocates say eliminating the tipped wage would mean servers and others would have more consistent income and wouldn’t potentially need to ask for more pay when tips fall short. The restaurant industry says the existing tip structure means many jobs already pay well above the minimum wage, and that the Biden plan would put jobs at risk while restaurants are still hurting from the pandemic.<br />Senate Democrats are divided over the proposal, with some lawmakers pressing for a smaller increase and others raising concerns about the proposal’s approach to tipped wages. Some Republicans have indicated support for a wage increase, but haven’t embraced the Democrats’ plan.</td>

It forms an unofficial border across which there is frequent shooting. Each side holds a part of Kashmir but claims the whole of that territory. India and Pakistan are nuclear armed, and there have been three major wars between them, as well as smaller conflicts.<br />The cease-fire came into effect from midnight Wednesday, according to the joint statement. It followed a conversation between senior military officers of the two countries over a hotline, in a “a free, frank and cordial atmosphere,” the statement said.<br />“This is a positive step forward,” said Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Pakistan’s foreign minister, speaking to a local news channel.<br />Each country accuses the other of unprovoked gun, mortar and artillery fire across the disputed border, with fighting escalating in recent years and killing both soldiers and civilians.</td>

      <td>India is establishing new rules to govern internet firms like  Facebook Inc.,  WhatsApp and  Twitter Inc.,  a fresh challenge for the American giants in a huge market that is key to their global expansion.<br />The new guidelines, unveiled Thursday, say that in order to counter the rise of problematic content online like false news and violent material, intermediaries must establish “grievance redressal mechanisms” to resolve user complaints about postings and share with the government the names and contact details for “grievance officers” at the firms. These officers must acknowledge complaints within a day and resolve them within 15.<br />Social media firms must take down material involving explicit sexual content within 24 hours of being flagged. Firms must also appoint officers and contact people—who live in India—to coordinate with law enforcement agencies and address complaints. Some firms must also help identify the “first originator” of some messages, the rules say.<br />“We appreciate the proliferation of social media in India,” Ravi Shankar Prasad, India’s minister of electronics and information technology, said Thursday. “We want them to be more responsible and more accountable,” he said.<br />The rules are New Delhi’s latest move to assert control over global tech firms that have experienced breakneck growth in a country of more than 1.3 billion. The regulations also come during monthslong farmers’ protests against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, which have sparked fierce debate on social media. They have emerged as Mr. Modi’s stiffest political challenge since he assumed power in 2014.</td>

      <td>The auto makers have decided they can work better together as separate companies, a year after announcing a planned merger</td>
      <td>Chinese car maker  Geely  has called off a deal to create the country’s first truly global auto firm. It wants the benefits of the merger without doing one—the idea of integration without a sale presents certain advantages, but it also looks like an attempt to satisfy fussy shareholders. It remains to be seen if the path of least resistance is actually the best one.<br />Geely and Volvo, which share the same largest shareholder, scrapped their plan to merge Wednesday. Instead, they will combine their powertrain operations including internal combustion engines, transmissions and hybrid systems to serve both car makers, as well as outside customers. Geely and Volvo will develop electric vehicles and self-driving technologies together and jointly source components including batteries and electric motors. In short, the two companies hope to achieve similar synergies that would be achieved by a merger. One year ago, they said they were in talks to formally combine.<br />Investors seem to like the idea: Geely’s Hong Kong-listed shares gained 2.7% Thursday. The two companies already share some technologies and a manufacturing platform. Even more integrated operation will help further shed costs and combine resources to tackle the next big thing in car-making: electric vehicles.<br />So why not merge outright then? Volvo’s chief executive officer said ditching the merger allows them to maintain full focus on growth without worrying about organizational disputes or power struggles arising from the combination. Having a price both sides could agree on is probably tough too. Though Zhejiang Geely, owned by Geely’s chairman Li Shufu, is the largest shareholder of both, a potential merger would likely need the approval from Geely’s minority shareholders. They probably would reject paying too high a price for Volvo, as that means dilution to their shareholdings.<br />Mr. Li, who owns a 97.8% stake in Volvo through Zhejiang Geely, probably doesn’t want to sell too cheaply either. As the auto market has recovered, he may be able to get a better price going to the market. Zhejiang Geely postponed its plan to list Volvo three years ago as trade tensions hit auto stocks.</td>

      <td>Asian countries have seized market share that they are expected to keep</td>
      <td>Global trade has rebounded from its collapse in the early stages of the pandemic, with China and other Asian manufacturing countries grabbing a bigger slice of exports of everything from masks to bikes—market share they are expected to keep after the public-health crisis fades.<br />Now, as a global recovery gathers pace, trade will likely keep growing, say policy makers, business executives and economists. But it will be hampered by the growing difficulties factories face in meeting Western consumers’ appetite for goods.<br />Last April, as large parts of the global economy were in a deep freeze, economists at the World Trade Organization said global trade flows could suffer the largest peacetime decline since the Great Depression, possibly falling by as much as a third.<br />Instead, global trade flows fell just 5.3% last year, according to new data from the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, after having returned to pre-pandemic levels by November. That recovery required less than half the time it took flows to return to their previous level following the global financial crisis.<br />Demand for personal protection equipment, including face masks, soared. Working and schooling from home boosted demand for computers. Efforts to avoid risky public transport systems in cities boosted demand for bicycles. Many splashed out on new kitchens and furnishings. Huge government stimulus in wealthy countries has only turbocharged such demand.</td>

      <td>Strong results were offset by worries about chip-production constraints and growing opposition to the Arm deal</td>
      <td>Nvidia  was truly in some uncharted territory with its fiscal fourth-quarter results Wednesday, in that the chip maker is facing concerns that even great numbers alone won’t soothe.<br />And the numbers were great. Revenue for the quarter ended Jan. 31 soared 61% year-over-year to $5 billion, beating Wall Street’s forecast. That was thanks to booming sales of graphics processors in both the company’s videogame and data-center businesses, the latter of which managed to surpass the record-breaking sum of the previous quarter despite widespread expectations that giant cloud-computing companies would ease back on the spending throttle. Nvidia also projected total revenue of $5.3 billion for the current quarter—about 18% above the $4.5 billion analysts were expecting.<br />But Nvidia’s shares ticked up only slightly after the results, before turning down 2% later in the after-hours session. Concerns over the global chip shortage were one factor. As one of the world’s largest “fabless” chip companies, Nvidia is at the mercy of major producers like  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  and  Samsung .  But production across the semiconductor supply chain has been unable to keep up with demand, causing shortages across industry groups. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said on the company’s conference call Wednesday that he expects constraints to continue this year.<br />Nvidia is also facing growing opposition to its proposed acquisition of chip designer Arm Holdings, which is still awaiting regulatory approval and is now being investigated in the U.K. Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet Inc.—two major buyers of Nvidia’s data-center chips—have now both voiced their opposition. Nvidia maintained Wednesday its expected time frame of 18 months from the deal’s announcement in September to its closing, but skepticism on Wall Street has grown. Citing the growing opposition, Citigroup analyst Atif Malik wrote on Feb. 14 that “we lower our confidence to 25% from 60% that the deal can close.”<br />Even with those concerns, Nvidia should have a strong year ahead. Wall Street expects revenue to grow 20% for the fiscal year ending next January. And Nvidia said Wednesday it has taken steps to keep growing demand from cryptocurrency miners from causing shortages of its gaming chips, mainly by technical measures designed to limit the usefulness of gaming cards for crypto mining. This should help prevent a repeat of what happened in 2018, when a crash in crypto prices hurt Nvidia’s sales as miners dumped their cards on the secondary market. Crypto may be less of a problem for Nvidia this time, but production constraints and slow M&A approvals show how much of the company’s near-term story is dominated by matters out of its control.</td>

      <td>Rich countries’ governments borrowed $18 trillion from bond markets in 2020—more than ever before—but their borrowing costs hit a record low, due to a big rise in bond purchases by central banks, as well as a lack of concern about public debt levels among private investors.<br />The jump in government bond sales during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic was almost twice that recorded when the global financial crisis struck, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development research body. In contrast to the years that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, there was no rise in bond yields in 2020, and governments faced a lower interest bill than they did before the financial crisis, the OECD said.<br />The massive borrowing in much of the developed world reflects the unique circumstances of the pandemic, which has required unprecedented levels of aid for workers and businesses affected by social-distancing measures. But it also shows a more relaxed attitude toward government deficits among policy makers, investors and economists than a decade ago.<br />“It’s a lesson learned from the financial crisis that governments shouldn’t pull back their fiscal support early,” said Fatos Koc, a policy analyst at the OECD.<br />In its annual report on government borrowing, the OECD said its 37 member governments sold $18 trillion in bonds during 2020, which helped cover the cost of supporting households and businesses through the pandemic, as well as high medical costs.</td>

      <td>Higher Treasury yields create opportunities to pick up interest income, but benefit for shares may be limited without more loan demand</td>
      <td>The move in Treasurys has been greeted like an all-you-can eat buffet by bank investors starved for yield. But they might not want to gorge themselves all at once.<br />As the 10-year Treasury yield has jumped so far this year from around 0.9% to about 1.4%, U.S. big-bank stocks have risen over 20%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 4.5%. Banks’ move is justified in many respects, as higher long-term rates are fundamentally good for their lending business. And it is easy to see more room to run, as banks are still lagging behind the market overall since the pandemic began last year, and are historically still somewhat cheap relative to the S&P 500 on a price-to-earnings basis: about 34% cheaper, versus about 30% from 2014 to 2019.<br />But a closer look at how exactly banks might benefit from higher rates may put a damper on any emerging euphoria. What is unique about banks right now is that they are sitting on a mountain of unusually cheap deposits from consumers and businesses with a glut of savings. That has resulted in a big pile of cash sitting at the Federal Reserve earning nothing, which can in theory be rotated into securities. This is a very profitable potential trade: Analysts at Autonomous Research figure that big banks rotating just their present excess cash at the Fed into securities in 2021 and adding 1 percentage point of yield would increase the next year’s net interest income by 2.5% on average and earnings per share by roughly 5%.<br />But while banks’ actions in past cycles have sometimes been accelerants to rising rates, now they may be something of a curb.<br />For example, in the past banks have sometimes been sellers of mortgage-backed securities as rates across the board rise because the slower rate of repayment extends the duration of those bonds—a kind of risk banks don’t typically want. They worry about matching the duration of those assets to deposits, which could mean having to raise deposit rates.</td>

The latest loss is expected to bring the company’s full-year deficit to $3.84 billion, more than its losses in the previous four years combined.<br />Airbnb saw revenue evaporate in the early months of the health crisis. That started to change as scores of people used the platform to plan nearby trips in the summer. Fourth-quarter revenue is expected to fall 33% to $747 million from $1.06 billion a year earlier. Full-year revenue is expected to fall 32%.<br />Airbnb has been the bellwether of an otherwise battered travel industry. Chief Executive Brian Cheskysuccessfully pivoted the company’s strategy to focus on rural stays while hotels in big cities suffered. At the same time, he cut a quarter of staff, paused noncore operations and slashed the company’s hefty marketing budget to keep expenses down.<br />The uptick in revenue, combined with deep cost cuts, helped Airbnb turn a third-quarter profit, boosting investor confidence ahead of its initial public offering in December. Airbnb shares doubled in their market debut and had climbed nearly threefold from their IPO price through Wednesday’s close.

      <td>The number of publicly traded companies is rising after a two-decade slump, a shift that highlights how businesses are clamoring to capitalize on the buoyant investor sentiment that has carried everything from stocks to bitcoin to record highs.<br />Last year’s increase in the number of companies listed on U.S. exchanges was the largest since the late-1990s dot-com bubble. The total is expected to surge even more this year as hundreds of companies tap everyday investors, according to data compiled by University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter.<br />That marks a key change because the number of listed companies fell steadily for 20 years, declining from roughly 8,500 in 1997 to 4,500 in 2017, as the internet bubble burst, startups raised huge sums through venture-capital and private-equity firms, and mergers and acquisitions shrunk the pool of public companies. After edging higher in 2018 and 2019, the number of listed companies surged by nearly 200 last year during a record stretch in the market for initial public offerings.<br />Shares in companies such as dating-app operator  Bumble Inc.,  online real-estate rental business  Airbnb Inc.  and digital food-delivery provider  DoorDash Inc.  soared recently after traditional IPOs. A torrid stretch in the market for special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, is adding to the frenzy. Also called blank-check firms, SPACs are shell companies that list on an exchange with the sole purpose of acquiring a private company to take it public. The private company, typically a startup, then gets the SPAC’s place in the stock market.<br />Some companies, such as workplace-communications business  Slack Technologies Inc.,  have even garnered lofty valuations by going public through direct listings. Those let companies sell shares directly to the public without going through banks, but prevent them from raising new money.</td>

This has implications for fans of gold or cryptocurrencies who fret about runaway inflation.<br />Investors’ inflation expectations can be seen in Treasury markets by looking at the difference between the yields on ordinary Treasurys and the yields on inflation protected Treasurys, known as TIPS. This difference is called the break-even rate.<br />The difference between five-year Treasury and TIPS yields shows break-even inflation expectations have risen to nearly 2.4% in recent days—the highest level since May 2011, implying inflation is set to pick up.<br />But there is more going on below the surface. Shorter-term break-even rates are higher than longer-term ones, an extremely rare situation—known as an inversion of the break-even curve. This forecasts a spike in inflation that then falls away.</td>

The talks began after two failures in 2018, one on a 777 operated by  United Airlines Holdings Inc.  and the other on a Southwest Airlines Co. 737.<br />Because potential modifications to 777 external engine covers, commonly known as cowlings, had various shortcomings, “Boeing has decided to redesign the fan cowl instead of trying to modify existing fan cowls to address both the structural strength concerns” and moisture issues, according to the internal FAA document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />“Boeing will be manufacturing new fan cowls and providing service instructions for operators to remove and replace the fan cowls,” according to the document, part of a routine Aug. 6, 2020, update on efforts under way at the agency’s Seattle-area offices. Boeing and the FAA declined to comment on the engine-cover plan’s status Wednesday.<br />Such changes to airplane parts can require years of design, testing and regulatory approvals. Some aviation-safety experts and regulators have been growing increasingly concerned about whether engine covers are robust enough to withstand the impact of a fan blade’s breaking off and shooting outward during flights.</td>

The Labor Department will publish the latest data at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday.<br />The four-week moving average, which smooths out week-to-week fluctuations, was 833,000 in the week ended Feb. 13, within the roughly 750,000 to 850,000 range that has held since last October and above the pre-pandemic peak.<br />The recent data is broadly consistent with a labor market that has been stuck near neutral this winter, while other readings of the economy have pointed to a pickup.<br />Jobless claims are closely watched by policy makers and investors about the direction of the jobs market and overall economy, but winter storms that hit Texas and elsewhere could affect layoff trends in the short term. The storms, which caused widespread power outages and disruptions, could create temporary unemployment for some workers and may have made it difficult for people to file claims and for state governments to process them.</td>

      <td>U.S. stock futures were mixed Thursday ahead of fresh data on the economic growth, jobless claims and the manufacturing sector, which will offer fresh insights into the pace of recovery.<br />Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.2%, suggesting that the blue-chips index may climb to another record after closing Wednesday at an all-time high. Contracts linked to the S&P 500 were relatively flat. Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.4%, suggesting declines in tech stocks after the opening bell.<br />Investors’ appetite for risky assets rebounded on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments this week that the central bank will keep interest rates low for a while. Optimism about the economic recovery and a sharp rise in bond yields—which closed Wednesday at their highest level in a year—is prompting money managers to shift funds into stocks that are likely to benefit from a rebound this year. That has weighed on technology shares, which powered much of last year’s rally.<br />“The rise in bond yields triggers this rotation, away from growth stocks and more in favor of value stocks,” said Sophie Chardon, cross asset strategist at Lombard Odier. “The rise in yields is supportive for banks, higher oil prices are supportive for energy. It is a change of leadership.”<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 1.413%, from 1.388% on Wednesday. The yield on government bonds has been on the rise as investors cut their holdings of the safest assets.</td>

The spending also marks a deeper commitment to a South Korean entertainment industry enjoying heightened prominence following the surprise success of the film “Parasite,” which last year won four Oscars including best picture—the first non-English-language film to do so.<br />Between 2015 and 2020, Netflix spent about $700 million on Korean content, on both licensing outside titles and making about 80 original films and TV series.<br />That includes a three-year partnership with one of South Korea’s major entertainment companies, CJ ENM Co., plus its production subsidiary Studio Dragon Corp. The deal has already produced hits such as “Sweet Home,” an apocalyptic suspense series. It has been watched by more than 22 million Netflix member households after its December debut, Netflix said last month, making it one of the Los Gatos, Calif.-based company’s more popular Korean-produced shows.<br />“Our commitment towards Korea is strong. We will continue to invest and collaborate with Korean storytellers across a wealth of genres and formats,” said Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s co-chief executive officer, in an online press conference on Thursday.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden on Wednesday revoked most immigration restrictions that former President Donald Trump imposed last year in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The White House said it was revoking parts of a ban that blocked entry into the U.S. to family members of U.S. citizens, some immigrants with employment-based green cards and winners of the diversity visa lottery. Mr. Biden has left in place restrictions that block the entry of foreigners with several types of work-based visas including the H-1B visa for high-skilled foreign professionals. That aspect of the ban is set to expire on March 31.<br />The Trump administration, which imposed the ban on most forms of legal immigration in April and expanded it in June, said at the time it had been necessary to prevent foreigners from coming to the U.S. and taking jobs when unemployment had skyrocketed as a result of the pandemic. A Wall Street Journal review found the ban didn’t have the intended effect: Jobs allotted to foreigners, typically in high-skill roles as software engineers or seasonal positions such as working at a resort, went unfilled.<br />The ban “harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here,’’ the White House said. “It also harms industries in the United States that utilize talent from around the world.’’<br />The revoked ban applied to applicants for U.S. permanent residency who are parents or siblings of U.S. citizens, along with applicants for several types of employment-based permanent residency cards, called green cards.</td>

That is about half as much as it previously planned to buy.<br />But part of the deal not previously reported sets Mr. Neumann apart from other shareholders. It calls for SoftBank to give the 41-year-old the $50 million special payout and extend by five years a $430 million loan it made to him in late 2019, the people said. SoftBank is also slated to pay $50 million for Mr. Neumann’s legal fees. It isn’t clear how much it is paying for the other shareholders’ legal fees.<br />The settlement between SoftBank, Mr. Neumann and the other shareholders isn’t final and the terms could still change, the people cautioned. Should the parties reach agreement, potentially in the next few days, it would avert an early-March trial.<br />WeWork is separately negotiating a combination with a special-purpose acquisition company called BowX Acquisition Corp. that would provide the startup with a public listing, people familiar with the discussions said. While the talks could still fall apart and other options are being considered, WeWork and BowX could reach agreement as soon as next week, some of the people said.</td>

Long-term bond yields are rising, showing increasing demand for funds from consumers and businesses, and inflation expectations are at multiyear highs. The price of everything in markets, from a barrel of oil to a share of mall retailer GameStop Corp. to a bitcoin, seems to be going up.<br />And moments of caution have been short-lived. Earlier this week, investors sold tech stocks, concerned that the rising long-term interest rates brought by an improving economy would make tech less attractive—in effect, that the economic outlook was too good. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday reiterated that low rates would be around for a long time. Tech stocks promptly bounced.<br />The everything rally shows that investors believe the fun is just getting started. They believe that a combination of more fiscal stimulus, more-extensive Covid-19 vaccinations and pent-up demand for consumption, on a background of near record-low interest rates, will at last kick-start economic growth and inflation that have been elusive in recent years.<br />As the U.S. moves past the pandemic, markets are saying Americans will spend on big-ticket items such as vacations and weddings, companies will go on hiring sprees and the transition to new technologies such as electric vehicles will accelerate. The most optimistic investors believe the economy, just months after it was devastated by the pandemic, will bounce back in a manner akin to the Roaring ’20s.</td>

More than three dozen candidates have filed for the contest to succeed Mayor Bill de Blasio, who will leave office at the end of this year due to term limits. The mayoral primaries will be held on June 22.<br />The majority of donors are from New York City, and 84% of the contributions were below $250, according to the campaign finance records. But a few ZIP Codes in Manhattan accounted for a large amount of high-dollar donations.<br />In the 10024 ZIP Code in Manhattan’s Upper West Side, 1,250 donors have given more than $514,000, according to the Campaign Finance Board records. The majority of donors in the ZIP Code gave to two Democratic mayoral candidates: city Comptroller Scott Stringer and Ray McGuire, a former vice chairman at Citigroup.<br />On Manhattan’s Upper East Side, 606 donors living in the 10021 ZIP Code gave a total of $472,986, records show.

That was Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s main message to Congress and markets in two days of testimony this week, with a side order of modern monetary theory.<br />Mr. Powell told everyone not to worry about rising interest rates or soaring asset prices because he and the Fed aren’t worried. “The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved,” he said early and often.<br />He’s focusing the Fed instead on the full employment half of its mandate. Some 10 million jobs haven’t returned following the Covid-19 lockdowns of the past year, and Mr. Powell and other Fed board members aren’t wrong to suggest the data conceal many other people who have left the job market.<br />Yet Mr. Powell also thinks, or at least claims, that the Fed can solve this problem with monetary levers when the real fix will be when the vaccine rollout facilitates a rapid reopening of the economy. Mr. Powell thinks the economy could grow 6% or so this year. But he never explains why that growth wouldn’t naturally boost employment absent the Fed's interventions, or how stoking demand via successive government spending bills amid supply constraints won’t trigger inflation.<br />Mr. Powell also used the jobs issue to justify continued large-scale Fed purchases of mortgage-backed securities ($40 billion a month) and Treasury bonds ($80 billion). Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will be grateful. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal budget deficit will be $2.4 trillion this year under current law, and the Biden Administration’s $1.9 trillion spending bill would push it past $4 trillion.</td>

The stock, which was halted twice on Wednesday for volatility, last traded at that level on Feb. 3.<br />A clear catalyst behind the sudden surge couldn’t be determined. The company said after markets closed Tuesday that its chief financial officer would resign March 26. GameStop in recent months has come under pressure to focus more heavily on e-commerce. Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen, who holds a nearly 13% stake in GameStop through his investment firm RC Ventures LLC, was recently added to the retailer’s board.<br />Since GameStop’s epic rise in late January, some individual investors have remained bullish on the stock and were re-energized when Keith Gill, the trader on Reddit known as DeepF—ingValue, disclosed that he had doubled down on the stock. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Gill posted a screenshot to Reddit showing that he had purchased an additional 50,000 shares of the stock. Following the news, the stock jumped 13% Monday.<br />Even with Wednesday’s surge, the stock is still trading more than 80% below its intraday peak of $483 in late January. Meanwhile, short interest in the stock has substantially diminished. As of Tuesday, short interest was roughly 39% of the stock’s free float, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

      <td>The Covid bill hides a major expansion of the Affordable Care Act.</td>
      <td>We’ve been telling readers about the progressive policy priorities hitching a ride on Congress’s “Covid relief” bill. That includes shoveling billions into the Affordable Care Act, with the goal of making government insurance a middle-class entitlement on the way to Medicare for All.<br />Provisions of the $1.9 trillion bill moving through the House make Affordable Care Act subsidies more generous and available even to the affluent. Buying an ObamaCare policy makes sense if a subsidy shields you from fearsome premiums and out-of-pocket costs; more than 85% of enrollees receive such a subsidy. But those who earn too much to qualify for government subsidies have been fleeing the exchanges. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servicessaid last fall that unsubsidized enrollment dropped 45% between 2016 and 2019.<br />Instead of making the underlying product better or less expensive, Democrats now want to pass more of the cost onto taxpayers. More low-income buyers would pay little to nothing for insurance. Democrats would also remove the income cap for receiving subsidies, which is 400% of the poverty line, and reduce a person’s maximum contribution to 8.5% of income from 10%.<br />The ObamaCare “subsidy cliff” is poor policy that punishes Americans for working and earning more, but now government will spend scarce resources on those who don’t need help. Brian Blase of the Galen Institute has pointed out that a family of four headed by a 60-year-old earning $240,000 could qualify for a nearly $9,000 subsidy. These are not the folks hit hard by the pandemic, many of whom are eligible for Medicaid.<br />The supersized subsidies would cost $34 billion over two years but that is merely the beginning. The politics are such that the benefit will never be revoked. The more generous subsidies will be captured by insurers, who will continue to raise premiums, and the specter of high costs will push lawmakers to intervene again. Rinse, repeat. Smaller businesses may move their workers onto the exchanges instead of offering their own insurance.</td>

      <td>If it’s stacked with Democrats, it won’t be a credible inquiry.</td>
      <td>Nancy Pelosi wants a “9/11-type” commission to investigate the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, and there’s a case for doing it—if the goal is truly to find out why America’s seat of government was so poorly protected and how much of the violence was planned. Is that what Mrs. Pelosi is after?<br />There’s reason to doubt it, since she pushed to make the commission a partisan body. Her initial plan was to have seven members appointed by Democrats and four by Republicans. This is impossible to justify, especially in a country so closely divided. Democrats have 51% of House seats and Republicans have 49%, and the Senate is 50-50. Why, then, would Democrats get to appoint 64% of a Jan. 6 commission?<br />The only way an inquiry can defang disinformation and conspiracy theories, like the idea that the Capitol rioters were antifa agitators in disguise, is if the country thinks the effort is factual and fair. An even partisan split is crucial for credibility. Otherwise a sizable share of Americans will suspect it’s a political weapon designed to find President Trump guilty of incitement to insurrection, more or less, after a failed impeachment trial.<br />Mrs. Pelosi should want an inquiry that delivers a unanimous outcome, not one that breaks down on party lines. Heed the veterans of the 9/11 commission, which she invokes. Its Democratic vice chairman, former Rep. Lee Hamilton, told Politico that Mrs. Pelosi’s proposal “does not sound to me like a good start; it sounds like a partisan beginning.” Its GOP chairman, former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, said that without equal representation, “the report won’t have as much confidence from the American people.”<br />Another model is the 2005 Robb-Silberman report on faulty intelligence before the Iraq war. That commission followed the facts, instead of chasing a predetermined hypothesis. It was led by credible figures: Judge Laurence Silberman of the federal appeals court for the D.C. Circuit and former Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb.</td>

Mitt Romney’s son Taggart, as a partner. Solamere, a Boston firm with more than $1 billion in assets, seeks to invest in high-growth companies and help them expand and create jobs, he says. He was inclined to join the firm because it takes a conservative approach to adding debt to companies in its portfolio and eschews layoffs—two things private-equity firms are typically associated with.<br />“For 20 years in Congress, I’ve been preaching the virtues of the free-enterprise system,” Mr. Ryan said in an interview. “The reason I’m joining Solamere is that I want to practice what I preach.”<br />A SPAC is an empty vehicle that raises funds and then looks for a business to buy or merge with, usually within two years. Solamere Capital was the main sponsor of Mr. Ryan’s SPAC,  Executive Network Partnering Corp.<br />The vehicle, which raised about $360 million, is a twist on the traditional SPAC, with longer-term incentives for its backers and potentially slimmer fees for underwriters. Its founders won’t be able to sell any of their shares for three years after any merger closes; typically, SPAC founders can either sell a year after a merger closes or as soon as the shares trade above a certain level.</td>

It also said it expects about $5.3 billion in revenue for the current quarter, ahead of Wall Street’s expectations.<br />Demand for some of Nvidia’s chips has been so hot that it has outpaced the company’s ability to increase production, adding to chip-supply shortages riling the semiconductor industry.<br />Nvidia’s newest graphics cards were a holiday sensation, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said during an earnings call. She added that some inventories are likely to remain low in the first quarter even as Nvidia increases supply. “Throughout our supply chain, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components,” Ms. Kress said.<br />President Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order directing a broad review of supply chains for semiconductors and other critical materials.</td>

      <td>Regulations forbid utilities from building energy resiliency.</td>
      <td>The Texas power crisis demonstrated the fragility of the nation’s electricity infrastructure. Outmoded policies and regulations have disabled the creation of a market for resiliency.<br />In most states, utilities are regulated monopolies. A Public Utility Commission sets rates based on state laws, many of which allow utilities to charge a premium for renewable electricity. That has induced utilities to install gigawatts of wind and solar capacity.<br />But there are no such incentives for resiliency. Not only aren’t utilities required to provide more-reliable power; they can’t offer resiliency at a higher price because rates are fixed. It is as if the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration didn’t require air bags or seat belts and forbade automakers to charge a premium if these safety features were provided.<br />Worse, many states penalize customers who try to implement their own resiliency solutions. In California, essential businesses are forced to pay punitive charges to the utilities if they generate nonintermittent onsite power. PUCs and utilities suggest that these charges ensure that customers pay their “fair share” to fund wildfire mitigation and energy-efficiency programs.<br />To build a resilient power marketplace, lawmakers and PUCs should create incentives for resiliency, as they encouraged renewable energy. They should authorize higher rates for resilient electricity, so that utilities can make long-delayed infrastructure upgrades.</td>

Federal Judge Anthony R. Mautone subsequently dismissed the two charges during the hearing.<br />During the hearing, Mr. Springsteen pleaded guilty to the third charge of consuming alcohol in a closed area.

At his first, in February 2011, he announced he was “thinking about” a White House bid because America had “become a whipping post for the rest of the world.” He had “participated in many battles” and “really almost come out very, very victorious every single time,” having “beaten many people and companies” and “intelligently earned many billions of dollars, which in a sense was both a scorecard and acknowledgment of my abilities.” He spontaneously called Rep. Ron Paul, winner of that year’s CPAC presidential straw poll, a loser with “zero chance of getting elected.” Sound familiar?<br />Mr. Trump didn’t run in 2012, but many themes of his 2016 campaign were there in his 2011 remarks: defeating China, ending dependence on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and promises to “blast” an American enemy—Somali pirates in that case—“so fast.”<br />Back then he was allowed only five minutes to talk. A prerogative of being the former president is he’ll have as much time he wants Sunday. How he uses it will be important.<br />One approach would be to devote the speech to his anger and grievances over losing the election. He could complain it was stolen and brag about winning more than 74 million votes. He could claim credit for every GOP victory, from flipping House seats to adding state legislative chambers, while blaming others—notably Minority Leader Mitch McConnell—for every GOP failure, including losing the Senate.</td>

      <td>Trusted technocrat Mario Draghi heads a coalition that includes former euroskeptics.</td>
      <td>Italy, like the U.S., recently completed an experiment in populist government. The antiestablishment Five Star Movement and the anti-immigration League formed a coalition after elections in 2018, but it broke down after little more than a year. As in America, the new head of government is an establishment figure. But unlike President Biden, Prime Minister Mario Draghi is known less as a politician than a technocrat: an economist with a doctorate from MIT who has headed the Italian Treasury, Bank of Italy and European Central Bank. He stays off social media and seldom gives interviews or public speeches.<br />“When I was prime minister, Mario Draghi was director general of the Treasury. I know him personally and professionally,” Lamberto Dini told me. He led the government in 1995-96, “He is very reserved. He would call only when there was a problem to solve, and he would solve it. He is not just a technocrat; he is a great political figure.”<br />Mr. Draghi, 73, is best known for rescuing the euro during its debt crisis in 2012. He promised in a speech that the ECB would do “whatever it takes” to salvage the eurozone, which stopped international speculation against the currency.<br />This month President Sergio Mattarella appointed Mr. Draghi to head a national-unity government. Unlike in the U.S., there was no populist backlash against the new establishmentarian leader. Instead, the antiestablishment Five Star Movement and League were so eager to join the new cabinet that they abandoned their former euroskeptic positions. The coalition also includes the center-left Democratic Party, the free-market Forza Italia, and the democratic-socialist Free and Equal party. The only opposition party is the right-wing Brothers of Italy.<br />The unelected Mr. Draghi is popular with voters. According to a survey by Noto Sondaggi, a leading Italian pollster, 56% of Italians have confidence in him—the highest figure recorded in two decades. Markets seem to share the feeling: Benchmark Italian bond yields hit record lows after the appointment.</td>

Why haven’t we already moved to T+1 or T+0?<br />A previously arcane subject—the securities transaction-settlement cycle—is now top of mind. Determining how long the cycle should be involves walking the fine line between making the system more efficient and allowing slack to correct potential errors.<br />U.S. securities markets may now be ready to benefit from technological and operational advancements in back-office administrative functions and move to a shorter cycle, but that determination can’t be made without additional evidence and cooperation from market participants, regulators and investors.<br />The time to re-evaluate the length of the securities-transaction cycle is now, while memories of the GameStop debacle are fresh.</td>

It would consist of three members appointed by President Biden and another eight appointed by the four top congressional leaders, with each leader appointing two members.<br />Under that structure, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) would be able to choose only four of the 11 members, with the other seven in the hands of Democrats. The Republicans say that gives the commission a partisan tilt, in contrast to the 9/11 commission, which was evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats.<br />“Any undertaking along these lines must be fair and evenhanded,” Mr. McConnell said in criticizing the Democratic proposal. “That shouldn’t be controversial.”<br />“I understand the question about who appoints them—but it doesn’t necessarily mean that the president wouldn’t appoint someone with a different voter registration than our party,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar (D., Calif.), the vice chairman of the House Democratic caucus.</td>

      <td>The effort to bring data from the human genome into medical therapy and practice has been thrilling and frustrating.</td>
      <td>In the months after Carson Miller was born, his parents Danny and Nikki—a young couple living in Northern California—noticed that he was having trouble with basic movements, like rolling over and crawling. He managed to take a few steps at 12 months but never got beyond that. When his brother Chase was born a year later, the parents’ anxiety turned to dismay as the younger boy also struggled with motor activity. Desperate to understand what was wrong, Danny and Nikki took their wheelchair-bound children to a series of doctors, enduring test after test; yet a diagnosis remained elusive. Finally, the family saw a group of medical detectives—part of an academic consortium called the Undiagnosed Diseases Network—who subjected the family’s DNA to a comprehensive analysis. The doctors at last identified the problem: an unusual defect in the energy machinery of the boys’ cells. Diagnosis firmly in hand, the family could now turn their attention to treatment.<br />The fact that critical information lurks within the three billion or so pairs of letters representing our genetic instructions was a key driver of the Human Genome Project, begun in 1990 and completed, with suitable fanfare, 13 years later. But translating DNA sequence into actionable insight hasn’t been easy. This is a major theme of “The Genome Odyssey,” Euan Ashley’s impassioned, firsthand account of the effort to bring genomicdata into clinical practice and help patients like Carson and Chase.<br />For starters, says Dr. Ashley, a cardiologist and geneticist at Stanford, there was the price—prohibitively high early on. Thanks to advances in technology, the cost of sequencing an individual’s DNA has declined a million-fold since 2003—the equivalent, he says, of a Ferrari plummeting from $350,000 to less than 40 cents. The time required to decode a genome has plunged to days rather than years or months. When Jazlene, a newborn girl with a dangerously abnormal heart rhythm, arrived at Stanford in 2014, Dr. Ashley and his colleagues were able to identify the genetic cause within days and “practice more ‘precise’ medicine” by fine-tuning the infant’s therapy.<br />At the level of DNA, humans are 99.9% identical, Dr. Ashley reminds us. The challenge, for doctors, lies in figuring out which differences in the remaining 0.1% are medically pertinent. For many families, the diagnosis of a rare genetic disease marks the end of one journey and the beginning of a second one, focused on learning from similar patients and partnering with researchers to search for a cure.<br />While Dr. Ashley concentrates on genetic disease, he also highlights the promise of DNA “superhumans”—people who have been dealt an unusually good genetic hand. One example: Sharlayne Tracy, a college student in Dallas who enrolled in a University of Texas Southwestern study of cardiovascular health and was found to have astonishingly low levels of “bad” cholesterol. DNA analysis revealed a genetic defect disrupting PCSK9, a protein involved in cholesterol metabolism. The discovery prompted several pharmaceutical companies to develop medications targeting this protein. Two of the drugs, for the treatment of stubbornly high cholesterol, have been approved by the FDA.</td>

He had a rod, screws and pins inserted to stabilize his leg, foot and ankle. He experienced trauma to his leg’s muscle and soft tissue.<br />The question of his golf future is difficult to answer because relatively little is known about his precise condition and so few athletes in history are even vaguely comparable to him.<br />It’s also not the first time Woods has faced such questions. They surfaced beginning in 2008, when knee surgeries derailed his career, and 2009, when he crashed an SUV into a fire hydrant and a tree amid what became an ugly public marital scandal.

Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday accused him of sexually harassing her while she worked for the state, saying that he kissed her on the lips after a meeting in his office and suggested they “play strip poker” during an airplane trip.<br />Lindsey Boylan, who worked for the state’s economic development authority and in Mr. Cuomo’s office from 2015 to 2018, wrote in a Medium post that Mr. Cuomo “would go out of his way to touch me on my lower back, arms and legs” and that he sought her out at official events.<br />“Governor Andrew Cuomo has created a culture within his administration where sexual harassment and bullying is so pervasive that it is not only condoned but expected,” Ms. Boylan wrote. “His inappropriate behavior toward women was an affirmation that he liked you, that you must be doing something right. He used intimidation to silence his critics. And if you dared to speak up, you would face consequences.”<br />Caitlin Girouard, a spokeswoman for the Democratic governor, said Wednesday that Ms. Boylan’s accusations were “quite simply false.”<br />In a Dec. 13 Twitter post, Ms. Boylan accused Mr. Cuomo of sexual harassment during her time working for the state, but she didn’t provide specific details. At the time, the governor denied the accusations.</td>

      <td>Attorneys for company founder Elizabeth Holmes say prosecutors can’t prove fraud case without the results of millions of blood tests</td>
      <td>Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes is sparring with federal prosecutors over an inaccessible database recording millions of the company’s blood tests, arguing the government can’t prove the test results were unreliable without the database’s information.<br />If Ms. Holmes’s argument is successful, prosecutors could be blocked at her criminal trial in July from presenting testimony from patients who government lawyers say received inaccurate test results from the company. Without broader Theranos results from the database, the witness testimony would be anecdotal and irrelevant, her attorneys said in court filings Tuesday, because prosecutors can’t show that the firm’s blood tests were less accurate than those from other companies.<br />Federal prosecutors said in a filing last month that their case “is hardly ’anecdotal,’” and that they will show Theranos’s reliability and accuracy problems through whistleblowers and federal regulator reports, along with patient stories. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in 2016 that its inspection of Theranos’s lab found deficient practices that posed immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.<br />Ms. Holmes, once a star Silicon Valley entrepreneur, faces federal charges that she defrauded investors and patients about her company’s technology, which purported to use just a few drops of blood from a finger prick to test for a variety of health conditions. The Wall Street Journal first reported in 2015 that the company’s proprietary technology was unreliable and that the company conducted most of its tests on standard blood-testing machines that it sometimes modified.<br />Ms. Holmes and prosecutors agree that the database, known as the Laboratory Information System, no longer exists. They disagree, however, on how that came to be, and whether its absence is damaging to the prosecution.</td>

Every new Paramount movie would become available on the Paramount+ platform after appearing in theaters, he added.<br />“In short, if you love movies, Paramount+ is a streaming service that you can’t live without,” Mr. Bakish said.<br />ViacomCBS’s decision to shorten the theatrical window follows similar moves by rivals including  Walt Disney Co. ,  Comcast Corp.’s  NBCUniversal and  AT&T Inc.’s  WarnerMedia that are seeking to balance their lucrative theatrical exhibition businesses with the success of their own video-streaming services, which have become central to their owners’ corporate strategies.</td>

The study also found the vaccine is 92% effective in preventing severe disease.<br />The results are in line with the vaccine maker’s own clinical trial, but the large size of the study, which covered nearly 1.2 million people, provides more precise insight into older age groups that were sparsely covered by the drugmaker’s trial, according to the study’s authors.<br />The peer-reviewed study, parts of which have been reported previously, was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.<br />Israel is the only country that has begun vaccinating all age groups over 16 in relatively large numbers, as part of its campaign to inoculate a majority of its nine-million population by March.</td>

A shortage of the asset can degrade service, putting a carrier at a competitive disadvantage.<br />The most recent spectrum sale offered cellular companies, cable-TV providers and other qualified bidders a chance to expand their wireless operations into the C-band range, a swath of airwaves previously restricted to satellite communications. The commission auctioned off 280 megahertz of the band, leaving the rest to incumbent satellite users and guard bands to block interference.</td>

Belk’s sprint through chapter 11 was the one of just a handful of cases that were completed in under 24 hours.<br />Prepackaged bankruptcy filings are popular because they take less time and cost less in administrative and professional fees. But superfast bankruptcies like Belk’s are rare.

      <td>U.S. foreign policy isn’t to blame for the mullahs’ deep-rooted hatred of America and Americans.</td>
      <td>Iran, Europe and many American progressives are pressuring the Biden administration to revive the 2015 nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. Official groupthink has coalesced around a singularly misguided belief: The U.S. has so badly mistreated Iran in the past that it must engage and appease the Islamic Republic now. I understand this view because I was once taught to believe it. This mindset is what convinced me in 2016 that I could safely do research for my dissertation in Iran. My optimism was misplaced. Not long after I arrived, I was imprisoned by Iran’s brutal regime and held hostage for more than three years.<br />When I went to Iran, I shared the prevailing academic view of the Middle East. I had absorbed the oft-repeated lesson that political Islam arose in response to Western colonialism and imperialism, and that the West—particularly America’s Middle East behavior—was chiefly responsible for the region’s chaos. My professors taught that the U.S. had treated Iran with a mixture of Orientalist condescension and imperialist aggression since the founding of the Islamic Republic in 1979. I believed America’s role in the 1953 coup that removed Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh explained everything that had gone wrong in Iran. Convinced that the mullahs’ hostility toward the U.S. was exaggerated, I often dismissed allegations of the regime’s malign behavior as American propaganda.<br />Since it was obvious that American foreign policy itself was the problem, and that the regime would happily normalize relations once the U.S. pivoted away from disrespect, I assumed I’d be left alone in Iran if I remained apolitical and focused on historical research. Imagine my shock when the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence arrested me on false espionage charges in August 2016, shortly after the implementation of the JCPOA—during what appeared to be a period of rapprochement between the U.S. and Iran. I was thrown into solitary confinement, forced to confess things my interrogator knew I had not done, and sentenced to 10 years in prison.<br />My interrogator made clear that my sole “crime” was being an American. He told me I was to be used as a pawn in exchange for U.S.-held Iranian prisoners and the release of frozen Iranian assets. (I was released in a 2019 prisoner swap.)<br />My terrible 40-month imprisonment was a period of intense re-education about the relationship between Iran and the U.S. The Islamic Republic is an ambitious power, but not a constructive one. It’s a spoiler, projecting influence by exporting revolution and terrorism via its proxies in the Middle East. Domestically, the mullahs have failed to deliver on their political and economic promises to the Iranian people, on whom they maintain their grip through oppression.</td>

It provides services including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and selling and redeeming Treasury bills.<br />The Fed sent an alert to such customers at 12:43 p.m. ET of “a possible issue or disruption to multiple services.” In a subsequent alert, it said Fed staff became aware of “a disruption for all services” beginning around 11:15 a.m.</td>

      <td>After avoiding dementia dramas, a writer finds new perspectives in a spate of films exploring the disease in unconventional ways.</td>
      <td>My mother was the reason I initially resisted “The Father.” The new film stars Anthony Hopkins as a man struggling against the effects of dementia. That synopsis was enough to trip my avoidance instinct, despite the time that has passed since my mom’s death, on Feb. 18, 2017, at age 76 from Alzheimer’s disease.<br />I had learned all I wanted to know about dementia from her. Over seven years, I saw it change Joan Jurgensen from the captain of my family to a castaway adrift in time and place, who fussed over invisible children at her feet, grieved anew each time she learned that her parents died decades ago, and sang church hymns even after she struggled to form linear sentences.<br />But lately I’ve been re-examining that chapter, drawn in by the work of filmmakers using cinematic techniques—manipulations of time, perspective, setting and genre—to explore the interior worlds of dementia. With more and more people living with Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia (now nearly 6 million Americans, plus their caregivers) these movies show how reckonings with the disease in art are evolving.<br /><br />Last year’s “Relic,” from writer-director Natalie Erika James, is a horror movie set in a house mirroring the space inside its owner’s deteriorating mind. In “Elizabeth Is Missing,” a recent PBS movie starring Glenda Jackson, 84 years old, a woman’s memory loss is a plot device and a metaphor in her search for a vanished friend. In the format-bending documentary “Dick Johnson Is Dead,” filmmaker Kirsten Johnson grapples with the impending loss of her father by casting him in faux movie scenes, complete with stunt doubles and elaborate sets.</td>

      <td>He refused to apologize for fake transgressions and never lost his humor. More could follow his example.</td>
      <td>Rush Limbaugh is frequently credited with reviving talk radio in America, and that is true. But Limbaugh was also “patient zero” of today’s cancel culture, with dozens of efforts to kill his program for one ginned-up controversy after another. They all failed, and the inside story of how he handled the efforts to discredit him is a useful lesson for today.<br />Rush’s first rule was simple: “No faux apologies for fake transgressions.” The best illustration was the “phony soldiers” controversy in 2007. Rush was speaking with a caller on his program about “phony soldiers” like Jesse Macbeth, who had falsely claimed to have seen war crimes, and who was ultimately convicted for receiving veterans benefits to which he was not entitled. But Harry Reid and 40 other Senate Democrats deliberately misinterpreted his comments and sent his syndicator a letter demanding an apology, which of course wouldn’t have been accepted.<br />Rush auctioned their letter off in a show of gleeful brio, marching the document on stage handcuffed to his security guard during a Philadelphia speech. He matched the $2.1 million winning bid with his own funds, and donated the money to scholarships for the children of fallen service members and police officers. It was classic Rush: punching a hole in the arrogant, exposing their flaws, turning something fake into something larger than life, all while having “more fun than a human being should be allowed to have,” as he often said.<br />But it wasn’t all fun and games. Rush’s sponsors included thousands of small and growing businesses; they relied on his audience to pay their employees. When the industry of boycotts and business harassment came knocking at his door, threatening his sponsors with ignominy for the crime of wanting to offer their products to his audience, Rush pushed back—and hard.<br />He privately supported his sponsors and told them that the so-called boycotts would have no effect on their business unless they relented and denied themselves access to his listeners. And he was right. Internet mobs are almost always made up of small numbers of people sending huge numbers of messages. They count on sheer volume to intimidate business. Rush showed sponsors research that proved that 80% or more of all online boycott messages came from a group of people so small as to “fit in the elevator we used to come to your office for this meeting.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell underscored his determination to return the U.S. labor market to full strength, saying Wednesday the central bank won’t begin to tighten easy-money policies until it sees much more improvement.<br />The Fed will maintain ultralow interest rates and continue hefty asset purchases until “substantial further progress has been made” toward its employment and inflation goals, Mr. Powell told the House Financial Services Committee in testimony identical to his opening statement Tuesday at the Senate Banking Committee. He said those goals are “likely to take some time” to achieve.<br />He also acknowledged that the economic outlook has improved since a slowdown in late 2020. The effects have rippled across financial markets in recent days, pushing bond yields up and prices for assets that are sensitive to interest rates, such as technology stocks, down. Mr. Powell’s assurances Tuesday that Fed policy is on hold for the foreseeable future drove stocks to a partial rebound.<br />But while financial markets often reflect expectations of economic growth, inflation and corporate earnings in the future, Mr. Powell said Wednesday the Fed is looking to see “actual progress, not forecast progress” toward its employment and inflation goals before it tightens its policies.<br />He said the Fed doesn’t foresee raising its benchmark fed-funds rate from near zero until three conditions have been met: a broad range of statistics indicate that the labor market is at maximum strength, inflation has hit its 2% target and forecasters expect inflation to remain at that level or higher.</td>

As a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, I know the Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power “at any time” to “make or alter” the regulation of the “time, place and manner” of federal elections. The broad grant of Congressional authority is contained in Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution and was recently noted by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Rucho redistricting case.<br />In addition, the 14th and 15th Amendments give Congress the power to eliminate racial discrimination in voting and the democratic process, such as restricting or creating barriers to voting, partisan gerrymandering and felony disenfranchisement. Though we had record voter turnout in the 2020 elections, voters continue to be disenfranchised because of long lines, broken voting machines and polling-place closures, disproportionately affecting black, brown and indigenous communities.<br />To frame this legislation as a means to only “benefit Democrats” is also false. During my years as a Republican election lawyer, I represented Republicans who supported many of the policies that are included in the bill, including voter registration and mail-in ballot provisions. Recent polling has also shown that two-thirds of Americans across party lines support the For the People Act. This landmark legislation is not only written within the legal bounds of our Constitution, it is also an integral step toward our nation’s promise of a democracy accessible to all Americans.<br />Congress should pass this legislation, which represents the clear will of the people. Our democracy can’t wait.<br />Trevor Potter</td>

You should be encouraging the use of policy tools that have been proven already to help restore confidence, stability and growth—while especially benefiting those most in need. An SDR allocation helped to do just that during the global financial crisis, and SDRs can again provide such help right now.<br />No one is claiming that the SDR is perfect, but a rational judgment would begin by examining what a new allocation would actually accomplish. First, it would provide liquidity to many emerging and developing countries that today have severely limited access to external financing but have the pressing need to pay for health and economic support. The approximately $274 billion that would accrue to emerging and developing countries as their share of an SDR 500 billion increase would represent a 10% boost to their international reserves and, in some cases, double that amount.<br />Second, advanced economies—and stronger emerging economies—would be able to further support the developing world by on-lending their newly acquired SDRs on a voluntary basis. We know that this “recycling” works because the IMF already has accomplished this using existing SDRs: Poor countries could receive about $24 billion in this fashion.<br />Third, an SDR allocation itself doesn’t require budgetary resources from any country. It doesn’t add to their debt, and it creates no new obligations to any participating country.<br />Your editorial assigns great importance to the SDRs’ quota-based initial distribution that you characterize as inefficient and potentially even malign. The applicable standard, however, is a comparison with alternative tools that can be applied in a relevant scale and with the requisite speed. It is in this context that the potential value of the SDR becomes apparent. Its design ensures accountability, its past use demonstrates its effectiveness and its appropriate application would ensure fairness.</td>

      <td>No longer will my guide dog, who lies quietly at my feet throughout an entire flight, be disturbed by an emotional-support dog barking at her.</td>
      <td>All blind and visually impaired travelers using a dog guide are indebted to the Department of Transportation for its recent ruling about documenting and admitting service animals on commercial flights (“The Middle Seat: Airlines Tighten Leash on Pets in the Cabin,” Personal Journal, Feb. 18).<br />I am blind and a frequent flier of  American Airlines  with help from my service dog, Eva. In the past, my travel experiences have been disturbed by passengers accompanied by untrained emotional-support animals that may make them feel comfortable, but disturb fellow passengers.<br />No longer will I be asked to move to make room for a fake service dog. No longer will my guide dog, who lies quietly at my feet throughout an entire flight, be disturbed by an emotional-support dog barking at her. No longer will dogs be urinating and defecating in airline terminals, which create a bad impression of actual service dogs that are trained not to relieve themselves in public places.<br />Anyone who owns a pet can understand a deep attachment to a beloved animal, but some of us need service animals to navigate busy departure terminals, the narrow confines of airplanes and our eventual destinations. The visually impaired travel with our guide dogs out of necessity, and the DOT and airlines were justified and entirely correct in setting new guidelines for identification and registration of service dogs.<br />Virginia Jacko</td>

      <td>The novelist known for ‘Strangers on a Train’ and ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’ inspired a new kind of movie villain in the 1950s who still stalks us today, in the centenary year of her birth.</td>
      <td><br /><br />The next time you watch a movie or TV series about a heartless serial killer, say a silent word of thanks to the novelist who made such plots possible. It was Patricia Highsmith, born a century ago last month, who flung open the doors of Hollywood and invited the crazies in.<br />Highsmith specialized in jolting tales of mentally disordered men and women who mirrored her own profound strangeness and motiveless malignity (she was a racist and anti-Semite). “If she hadn’t had her work, she would have been sent to an insane asylum or an alcoholics’ home,” a friend claimed. She made her debut as a novelist in 1950 with “Strangers on a Train,” the story of a charming psychopath named Bruno who offers a deal to a man whom he meets by chance on a train: He will kill the man’s promiscuous wife in return for having the father he despises murdered, assuming that no one will connect the two killings and both men will get away scot-free. Bruno fulfills his end of the deal, but Guy, the other man, never took the pact seriously and refuses to cooperate, sending Bruno into a downward spiral of lunatic frenzy. When Alfred Hitchcock filmed “Strangers” in 1951, he cast Robert Walker, heretofore a boy-next-door type, as Bruno, and Walker gave a performance whose flamboyant panache is at once perversely appealing and truly terrifying.<br />It was unusual to encounter such villains in Hollywood films of the ’30s and ’40s. The Motion Picture Production Code forbade the portrayal of villains who were sympathetic, much less charming or charismatic. Moreover, the “bad guys” in gangster movies, westerns and adventure films of the period were normally motivated by greed or revenge, not the mere desire to shed blood and sow chaos. And while some sympathetic villains, like Humphrey Bogart’s aging heister in Raoul Walsh’s “High Sierra” (1941), made it onto the screen, they, like the usual bad guys, got it in the end.</td>

      <td>Looking ahead to the Golden Globe Awards Sunday on NBC, we reached out to four nominees to ask them what they have been enchanted by in the last year. Here, they each recommend one of their favorite nominated titles. Below, edited excerpts:<br /><br />( Netflix )<br />Mr. Rhys is nominated for his performance of the title role in HBO’s “Perry Mason.” He recommends the Netflix’s series ‘Ozark,’ about a couple that launders money for a drug cartel, now three seasons deep. “Ozark” is nominated for multiple awards, including best performance by an actor in a drama series for Jason Bateman.<br />“What I always harken to about a show is: What’s the initial hook? After the first episode of ‘Ozark’ you go: oh, s—, how is that gonna resolve? And then you’re in. When the premise is that strong, you’ve got the golden ticket. And no one does everyman in peril better than Jason Bateman. You want to see how he’s going to deal with certain situations. And in a way, it’s kind of masochistic, to watch something where you’re so anxiety-ridden. He also has that rare thing where he can convey [it] comedically in a moment when it shouldn’t be present. Whether it’s through gestures or osmosis, he can kind of make you laugh in the most heightened situations.”</td>

The tie-up would create one of the world’s largest contract-research organizations, known as CROs, which test experimental drugs in animals and help run studies of promising late-stage drugs in humans.<br />In acquiring PRA, Icon would expand into digital and technology capabilities that are playing roles in clinical trials accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, such as virtual monitoring of study subjects as people stay at home and avoid public places. Raleigh, N.C.-based PRA’s products include mobile and digital platforms that enable trial subjects to enter medical information on their smartphones, easing the burden of data collection on study managers.<br />“I think the pandemic has shown everybody that we can do things differently and it works,” Icon Chief Executive Steve Cutler said Wednesday.  Dr. Cutler said Icon has about 1,000 employees working on Covid-19 vaccine research for  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE .<br />PRA has been helping drugmakers recruit subjects for trials evaluating Covid-19 drugs and vaccines and helping make Covid-19 testing more available.

      <td>Oenophilia is often undertaken with the utmost reverence. So our wine columnist went looking for levity—and bottles that bring joy in more ways than one</td>
      <td>I’VE BEEN THINKING about Ralph Steadman recently. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the English illustrator lent his whimsical style to wine books as well as the catalog for the Oddbins wine, beer and spirits retail chain in the U.K. Think tipsy, red-nosed drinkers and mice dipping into glasses of Sherry. The world of wine according to Mr. Steadman was highly irreverent, slightly diabolical and a great deal of fun.<br />The real wine world, by contrast, hasn’t been so much fun lately. Winemakers whose sales are down—their tasting rooms closed, in many cases, by government order—tend to be more earnest than amusing. Retailers, meanwhile, are more likely to sell wines with the aid of point scores than mouse cartoons. But because I believe that even the most serious oenophile appreciates, and perhaps needs, a laugh or two, I went looking for present-day wine fun. Happily, I found some good stuff.<br />“No one calls me unless they want to talk about something funny on our wine label,” said John Williams, founder of Frog’s Leap Winery in Napa Valley, when I called him the other week. I told him this was one of those calls. I’d bought a bottle of his wine recently and found a note on the back label instructing the buyer: “Open At Other End.”<br />Frog’s Leap has been funny for decades, ever since its first wine, a Sauvignon Blanc, debuted in 1981. The winery’s motto, “Time’s fun when you’re having flies,” made it clear that no one at Frog’s Leap, least of all Mr. Williams, takes him- or herself too seriously. For example, a timeline entry on the winery’s website notes, “John befriends Jonah Beer, Director of Sales at Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars while on the road and teaches him how to cheat on his expense account.” (The bit about the expense account is crossed out.)<br />Mr. Williams did note that humor can have its drawbacks. “When you inject any kind of playfulness into your messaging, to some people that might suggest that your wine isn’t good,” he said. I assured him I take him seriously, and the savory 2019 Frog’s Leap Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc ($19) I bought was quite good.</td>

Tipton of the Southern District of Texas, in a decision issued late Tuesday night, said the administration hadn’t offered a reasonable explanation for an across-the-board pause that left little room for considering deportations on a case-by-case basis.<br />The Biden administration on Jan. 20, its first day, announced the 100-day deportation moratorium, and the Department of Homeland Security began enforcing the pause on Jan. 22.<br />Judge Tipton said the new administration was entitled to leeway to formulate its enforcement priorities and review the Trump administration’s immigration policies, “but a need to assess priorities does not necessarily mean a pause on government functions.”<br />The judge, a Trump appointee, issued a temporary restraining order last month that initially blocked the policy, but those orders are short in duration. In the latest move, he issued a preliminary injunction against the pause, which will block it indefinitely.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Economic activity will pick up as the pandemic recedes and Americans are vaccinated against Covid-19, but the recovery will be gradual rather than sudden, a top economic adviser to President Biden said Wednesday.<br />“It is a dimmer switch, not an on-off switch,” Jared Bernstein, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said at a Wall Street Journal Executive Membership Series event. “People are not going to snap back into action on some set date because the vaccine penetration rate hits 53% or whatever. It’s going to be more gradual.”<br />Mr. Bernstein defended the president’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan against critics who say it risks overheating the economy and generating inflation. He acknowledged that rising inflation is a potential risk, but that a weak recovery that leads to scarring for households and businesses—such as long-term unemployment, foreclosures and bankruptcies—would do more harm.<br />“There is room for more heat,” he said, pointing to data on weekly claims for unemployment benefits, which came to 861,000 in the most recent report, and elevated jobless rates in minority communities as evidence of spare capacity in the economy.<br />Mr. Bernstein pointed to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said Tuesday that he doesn’t expect a temporary burst of federal spending to cause a large or persistent rise in inflation.</td>

But his tenure has been marked by several controversies, including this month’s $573 million settlement with states over McKinsey’s work advising OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and other drug manufacturers to aggressively market opioid painkillers<br />Mr. Sneader’s letter to employees about the opioid settlement was noticeably blunt in criticizing the firm’s behavior. He said the firm fell short of its standards and “did not adequately acknowledge the epidemic unfolding in our communities or the terrible impact of opioid misuse and addiction, and for that I am deeply sorry.”<br />Some partners felt that language was too strong and its advice to clients was legal and given in good faith, people familiar with the matter said.</td>

It allows Geely Auto to move forward with plans to raise the equivalent of nearly $3 billion through a share listing on Shanghai’s STAR Market for growth stocks. The decision also renews speculation that Volvo could seek an independent stock-market listing.<br />The two companies said last year that they were holding talks that could lead to combining their businesses. In the end, they said they feared that a merger would present integration issues and distract them during a period of industrywide transformation in the shift to electric vehicles.<br />“A full merger would be too much internal focus and organizational disputes and power plays,” Volvo Chief Executive Officer Håkan Samuelsson said in an interview. “I think that’s number one, to really maintain full focus on growth, especially since we have been growing a lot on the Geely and the Volvo side and don’t want to jeopardize anything there.”</td>

The yields were minus 0.057% for three-year debt and 0.646% for nine-year, the cheapest borrowing costs it has achieved to date. It was the second time it has issued bonds in euros.<br />One of the most oil-dependent countries in the world, Saudi Arabia has regularly tapped international bond markets since 2016 to balance its budget amid crude price swings. Its economy contracted 3.9% last year as the coronavirus pandemic hit global energy demand, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund, leaving it with a budget deficit of 12% of economic output by December.<br />The government has put forward a plan to more than halve this shortfall by cutting spending this year. Its decision to issue in euros is likely part of this, analysts said.<br />The eurozone has had a negative policy rate since 2014, which acts as a reference for sovereign and corporate debt, bringing down the cost of borrowing in euros overall. Governments and companies around the world often tap Europe’s bond market to access cheaper funds. China was able to borrow at negative rates for the first time last year in a three-part euro-denominated debt sale.</td>

This much Brandon Jew knew when he opened his restaurant Mister Jiu’s, back in 2016. “We have so much great produce here in the Bay Area,” he said. “It’s built into how we eat in San Francisco. And it’s built into my training as a chef.”<br />His first cookbook, “Mister Jiu’s in Chinatown: Recipes and Stories from the Birthplace of Chinese American Food,” co-authored with Tienlon Ho, comes out March 9. This recipe is a pared-down version of one included in the salad chapter. Mr. Jew calls for scattering sweet mandarin segments across a platter and topping them with shaved fennel, tarragon and salty Marcona almonds. The dressing is a revelation, a mix of olive oil, vinegar, toasted anise seeds and a surprising creamy element: almond milk. “It works like buttermilk,” Mr. Jew said. At the restaurant he uses a house-made “milk” made from apricot kernels, but a good store-bought almond milk works just fine here.<br />Though a salad like this one might not immediately register as the sort of Chinese American classic Mr. Jew features on his menu, this recipe still speaks to his memories of eating at Chinese restaurants as a child. “For dessert it was almond Jell-O with fruit cocktail,” he said. “These flavors remind me of that.”<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

      <td>Pledge comes as tech giants face world-wide government scrutiny over paying news publishers</td>
      <td>Facebook Inc.  said it would spend at least $1 billion to license material from news publishers over the next three years, a pledge that comes as tech giants face scrutiny from governments around the world over paying for news content that appears on their platforms.<br />The spending plans are in addition to $600 million that Facebook paid since 2018 in deals with publishers like the Guardian, Financial Times and others to populate its Facebook News product in some countries, according to a blog post Wednesday by Nick Clegg, a senior Facebook policy executive.<br />The social-media company’s new pledge is similar to a plan  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google announced last year to pay more than $1 billion to license news content for its Google News Showcase over a three-year period.<br />Facebook removed news from its platform in Australia last week as the country’s legislature debated a proposal that would have required Facebook and Google to pay traditional media companies for their content.<br />Facebook reached a deal with the government Tuesday that would restore news to the platform in exchange for measures like additional negotiation with media companies before binding arbitration kicks in. The revised legislation cleared its last major parliamentary hurdle on Wednesday.</td>

      <td>Golf legend Tiger Woods suffered significant leg injuries in a car crash Tuesday outside of Los Angeles that required emergency surgery after first responders pulled him from his wrecked vehicle with a pry bar and ax.<br />Woods was awake, responsive and recovering, according to a statement posted to his  Twitter  account early Wednesday morning.<br />Woods, 45 years old, has won 15 major championships and is considered by many to be the greatest golfer ever. He won the 2019 Masters after going more than a decade without any major titles—cementing a comeback few believed was plausible after years of injury and scandal.<br />What are his injuries?<br />Woods underwent a long surgical procedure on his lower right leg and ankle after being brought to the hospital, according to the statement. The hospital’s chief medical officer, Dr. Anish Mahajan, said he suffered “significant orthopedic injuries.”</td>

      <td>State, industry officials show little appetite to harden natural-gas systems after a winter freeze left millions without power and heat</td>
      <td>Natural-gas shortages were a major culprit in the blackouts that left millions freezing in the dark in Texas last week, but making the delivery system more resilient promises to be expensive as well as politically challenging.<br />Texas is normally flush with gas, as the nation’s largest producer. But both production and power generation from gas dropped by about a third last week during an unusually strong winter storm that caused demand for power and heat to surge.<br />Freezing water and blackouts wreaked havoc on everything from wells in the prolific Permian Basin to pipelines and regional storage facilities that feed power plants across the state. The resulting gas shortage sent prices soaring and disadvantaged power plants that purchase daily fuel supplies on the spot market.<br />The state’s gas infrastructure and power generation failed for similar reasons: Neither is designed to perform in subfreezing weather, unlike similar equipment in parts of the U.S. where colder temperatures are more common.<br />Engineers said Texas gas production was slowed by low temperatures that froze water produced alongside oil and gas and entered oil-field tanks. Compressors that help move oil and gas through pipelines also became inoperable because of the cold weather.</td>

      <td>Investors seem overly jittery about Lowe’s and Home Depot’s ability to outperform 2020</td>
      <td>Home Depot ’s  Chief Executive Craig Menear boasted on Tuesday that “for many customers, the home has never been more important.” Investors are getting anxious about how long that will continue.<br />Both Home Depot and  Lowe’s  had strong holiday quarters ended late January, with sales up roughly 25% compared with a year earlier. Among the best selling items were lumber and outdoor living categories such as patio furniture and grills. For the year, Lowe’s and Home Depot saw their revenue expand by 24.2% and 19.9%, respectively.<br />But investors are focused on the future. Despite strong results, Lowe’s and Home Depot shares dropped after their respective earnings calls this week.<br />Lowe’s stuck to the guidance that it laid out in December, in which it said sales would be around $86 billion in 2021 under the most bullish scenario, a decline of 4% from 2020. Home Depot declined to give guidance.<br />So far, there are no signs of sales slowing down. January was the strongest month of growth last quarter for both companies, boosted by fresh stimulus payments to consumers. Home Depot said on its earnings call that it has seen continued strong demand in February.</td>
