      <td>Companies won’t make permanent investments in new employees based on temporary revenue.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration says if Congress passes the proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill, we won’t have to “wait for years for the economy to return to full employment,” as two members of the Council of Economic Advisers put it in a recent White House blog post.<br />It’s the right goal. In April 2017, the unemployment rate dipped below what the Congressional Budget Office projected as full employment. It stayed there until the pandemic. That created intense competition for employees and drove wage growth at or above 3% for 20 consecutive pre-pandemic months. By 2019 median family income hit a record high, the poverty rate declined to a record low, and income inequality decreased for the second year in a row.<br />The jobs picture is all but certain to improve in a year when people are getting vaccinated and states are opening their economies. The labor market will improve in the coming months if the government does nothing. But massive spending will hurt more than it helps.<br />Business owners recognize that government spending can put more money into circulation and may result in increased sales. But they also know that government largess—no matter how generous—is finite. If you believe a revenue source is going to dry up, you don’t invest in growth and hiring based on its continuing.<br />Say you owned a restaurant and sales increased because your competitor next door burned down, but he had insurance and would rebuild. You’d certainly appreciate the increased sales, but you wouldn’t hire more permanent employees, because you know the increased revenue is temporary.</td>

      <td>Gov. Greg Abbott inadvertently gives Mexico protectionist arguments in energy.</td>
      <td>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s decision last week to ban natural-gas exports to Mexico temporarily was shortsighted and counterproductive for his state.<br />This isn’t to dismiss the suffering in Texas. But Northern Mexico, which was also in the deep freeze, is the Lone Star State’s largest trading partner and its biggest market for natural-gas exports. Trying to use a state edict to cut off Mexican power generators in a crisis was a public admission that in Texas’s eyes, customers south of the border don’t rate.<br />As the cold snap ends, gas exports will resume and life will go on as before for Texas gas suppliers. But Mr. Abbott has handed Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador a cudgel with which to beat Mexico’s economic liberals, who opened energy markets to private investment and trade in 2014. It is their fault, AMLO argues, that Mr. Abbott has the power to leave them shivering in the dark.<br />This claim is nowhere near the truth—I’ll get to that in a minute—but AMLO used it last week to launch a new blitzkrieg against energy competition, foreign and domestic, in Mexico. The world-class demagogue from Tabasco, who thrives on nationalism, now has the bit in his mouth. Over time it could cost Texas gas suppliers.<br />The Abbott decree was likely not even legal. “Force majeure” clauses in contracts might allow the interruption of shipments due to an act of God. But a governor doesn’t have jurisdiction to shut down international trade unilaterally.</td>

      <td>Even when TV was a ‘vast wasteland,’ it brought us together.</td>
      <td>Newton Minow famously called television a “vast wasteland”: “a procession of game shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, western bad men, western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons. And endlessly, commercials. . . . And most of all, boredom.”<br />That was 60 years ago. Today the options are far more vast, and many of them are of high quality. But we’ve lost something: With so many viewing options, TV is no longer America’s great common denominator.<br />In 1961, when Mr. Minow became chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the three most-watched television programs were westerns: “Wagon Train,” “Bonanza” and “Gunsmoke.” Each was seen weekly by roughly 1 in 3 Americans. Wasteland or not, it was part of a sweeping shared experience.<br />When I looked at Nielsen’s top 10 list of most-viewed series for 2020, I was surprised to discover that I had watched only three—and two of them were NFL football. My editor at the Journal had seen only the same three. (The third was the NBC drama “This Is Us.”) Neither of us has watched the two most popular scheduled nonsports series, the  CBS  crime dramas “NCIS,” with a 5.0 rating, and “FBI,” with 4.2. The numbers represent the percentage of homes with television that tuned in. In 1961 the rating for “Gunsmoke” was 37.3.<br />The issue isn’t whether cop shows are aesthetically better than cowboy shows. And it’s not as if Americans are watching less TV; in fact, adults view 4 hours and 8 minutes of television every day, according to Nielsen. When you add in other forms of “video time,” the total jumps to nearly 6 hours. (The pandemic drove up the number by about 35 minutes a day.)</td>

      <td>The pioneer of head-transplant surgery believed that the soul resides in the brain and could be rescued from physically compromised bodies.</td>
      <td>The “title characters” of Brandy Schillace’s admirable biography “Mr. Humble and Dr. Butcher: A Monkey’s Head, the Pope’s Neuroscientist, and the Quest to Transplant the Soul” were one and the same person: Robert J. White, a distinguished neurosurgeon, an accomplished neuroscientist and a man dedicated to searching for the means to transplant souls by transplanting the human brain. If this makes White sound macabre, Ms. Schillace’s account of his life, work and temperament is anything but. She deftly persuades the reader to take White seriously (he wasn’t even eccentric) and to ponder profound medical-scientific-philosophical issues. Best of all, the book is fascinating.<br />White (1926-2010)—blue-collar, middle-class, born in Duluth, Minn.—was, in many ways, a model American. He enlisted in the Army during World War II and served in the medical corps. Afterward he received a full scholarship to Harvard Medical School and in 1953 graduated with full honors. He subsequently enrolled in the University of Minnesota’s neuroscience program and completed his Ph.D. In 1961 he moved with his family (he and his wife would have 10 children) to Cleveland, where he founded the neurosurgery department and brain-research lab at Metropolitan General Hospital.<br />White’s contribution to mainstream medicine was groundbreaking and enduring. He played a seminal role in the medical use of “localized hypothermic cerebral perfusion”—putting the brain on ice, so to speak, to provide surgeons with the necessary time to repair it. Perfusion is now commonplace—it is also used in cardiac surgery—and has saved the lives of countless individuals who would otherwise have died. By the end of his life, White, a superb surgeon, had operated thousands of times, was loved by his patients and their families, advised two popes on bioethical matters, had written hundreds of articles and won numerous honors. He thought it important to make himself available to the press (perhaps too available: one headline read “Monkeys Help Doctor Get ‘Ahead’ ”) and popular culture (he was a consultant on the 2008 movie “X-Files: I Want to Believe”).<br />But Ms. Schillace didn’t write this book to chronicle the life of a routinely establishment physician. Even as a young man, White, a devout Catholic, was convinced that the soul was located in the brain, what the author describes as “three pounds of gelatinous convolutions and a hundred billion nerves.” White felt it was his religious and medical duty to devise techniques for rescuing healthy brains from otherwise diseased and dying bodies. His solution was to transplant heads (containing their brains) onto cadavers that were brain dead but otherwise physiologically viable.<br />Before he could attempt such surgery on people, White experimented, mostly on monkeys, dozens of times, to ascertain and refine the necessary procedures. In March 1970 he succeeded in transplanting a monkey’s head onto another monkey’s body. (A warning: Ms. Schillace’s descriptions of surgery are very detailed.) The transported head didn’t survive long, but the important thing for White was that sensors revealed electrical impulses emanating from the resettled brain. White believed that only brain death—the cessation of the brain’s electrical signals—meant true death. Therefore the monkey whose head was relocated, while its brain was still active, was, in White’s opinion, actually alive. He couldn’t wait to start on human transplants.</td>

Mr. Powell is again likely to signal that easy-money policies will remain in place for the foreseeable future, and face questions on the size of the next fiscal stimulus package, interest rates and bond purchases, and the potential for inflation to heat up alongside accelerating economic growth.<br />The U.S. housing market has been a consistent economic bright spot during the pandemic. Low mortgage rates and strong demand are helping propel sales and boost construction activity, but are also leading to higher prices for houses, lumber and other building materials. Wednesday’s report on January new-home sales will offer the latest gauge of the market.<br />U.S. jobless claims rose in the opening weeks of February, a sign of heavy layoffs and continued dislocation for workers across the country. Economists are forecasting a decline during the week ended Feb. 20, but even a significant drop would leave the level of claims historically elevated.<br />U.S. new orders for durable goods are expected to rise in January for a ninth straight month. Manufacturing rebounded strongly early in the pandemic in the midst of strong demand for factory goods, though some companies have started warning of rising input costs and supply-chain bottlenecks that could crimp growth.</td>

      <td>One example: The healthcare provider had to make close to 3,000 changes in its electronic health-records system</td>
      <td>Mayo Clinic, like many health providers, has been pushed to its limits by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its intensive-care units were often filled to or near capacity in 2020. And while doctors throughout the health system rushed to find ways to care for the wave of sick patients infected by the new virus, many of the medical and support staff were being sent home to work remotely.<br />The information-technology team led by Mayo Clinic Chief Information Officer Cris Ross faced immense challenges. Practically overnight, remote, secure and fast access to multiple systems had to be provided to thousands of workers, including doctors. The influx of Covid patients, meanwhile, needed to be able to communicate with the outside world while being kept in isolation. And it all had to be done on the fly. Adapting the healthcare system’s networks and building new tools to meet these demands required planning, decisions and execution at speeds undreamed of a short time before.<br />Mr. Ross spoke to The Wall Street Journal about his IT department’s efforts to support Mayo’s staff and how the pandemic is changing the way his team provides IT to the organization. Here are edited excerpts of the discussion.<br />WSJ: What was the biggest lesson you learned?<br />MR. ROSS: Sometimes we have an expectation that if we’re going to make a change, it’s going to take months and months—that we have to step slowly and carefully. But with the pandemic, we were forced to make decisions in weeks or days. We’ve discovered that when necessity requires rapid decisions and fast action, we can do it.</td>

      <td>The U.S. rejoins a climate pact that gives China a free carbon ride.</td>
      <td>The U.S. officially rejoined the Paris climate accord on Friday to much media and European applause. Our guess is that China is the most pleased because it knows the accord will restrict American energy while Beijing gets a decade-long free ride.<br />Paris is a voluntary agreement, and nations submit their own commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. The Obama Administration vowed to slash emissions 26% or more from 2005 levels by 2025, but the Trump Administration withdrew from the accord. President Biden has now pledged to reach “net-zero emissions no later than 2050.”<br />Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Biden is committing the U.S. without submitting the Paris agreement to the Senate as a treaty. They know it would never get a two-thirds vote for approval, and probably not even a simple majority. Yet the Administration will cite Paris to justify sweeping environmental regulations to raise the cost of fossil fuels and subsidize renewable energy and electric vehicles. It will bypass Congress for much of this.<br />The economic damage will be real. A 2017 analysis of the Obama Paris commitments, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Council for Capital Formation, predicted a $250 billion reduction in GDP and some 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025.<br />Meanwhile, China emitted nearly twice as much CO2 as the U.S. in 2018. Yet under Paris, Beijing gets a pass to increase its emissions until 2030. In 2020 China’s coal plants produced some 4,874 terawatt hours of energy—an increase of nearly 15% since it joined the pact, according to S&P Global Platts.</td>

And as Mr. Galston pertinently points out, the only purge which is coming to pass, albeit thus far on the state level, is that of those isolated Republicans who voted to convict.<br />Clearly those Trump-fatigue-afflicted Republicans who see President Trump as a radioactive force within the GOP aren’t reading the tea leaves properly. They can take solace in the fact that the Great Disrupter’s last disruptive act, unlike so many of his others, hardly put America first. “Character is destiny,” said Heraclitus. Yet despite that domestic day of infamy, he’ll undoubtedly be the party’s kingmaker now, though it’s an open question whether he could rise like a phoenix to become the party’s standard-bearer again.<br />One thing is certain: With President Biden in the White House doing the radical Democrats’ bidding on every front, one can readily envision a redux of Trumpism in 2024, sans the sizzling melodrama of its progenitor.<br />James Hyland<br />Beechhurst, N.Y.</td>

      <td>Emmanuel Macron is forcing through a law that effectively renders home schooling illegal for most parents.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “Emmanuel Macron and the Woke” (Feb. 18): While I welcome French President Macron’s apparent opposition to “wokeness,” far from restoring “classical liberal values,” he is forcing through a law that effectively renders home schooling illegal for most parents. Just as the German government in 1938 threatened parents with prison if they did not send their children to school from age 6, France will soon require all children from age 3 to attend school or else. Few truly independent options exist, as even the Catholic schools follow the state curriculum with full state funding.<br />Defenders of the law reiterate the view of French revolutionary Georges Danton in 1793 that children belong not first to their parents but to the state. MPs have acknowledged that they know they are taking away a fundamental right by seeking to make home schooling very difficult, but they forge ahead despite all evidence that this move is disproportionate and unnecessary to combat Islamic radicalism. The current law, which includes an in-home inspection of home-schooled children each year, is amply sufficient for detecting any madrasa-style “home schooling.” Having cited ad nauseam the example of 15 children found being radicalized, half of whom were registered as “home-schooled,” the government unjustly tars all 62,000 home-schooled children in France with the same brush.<br />The architects of recent terrorist attacks overwhelmingly have been products of the French (or Belgian) school system, none of them home-schooled. Mr. Macron’s totalitarian instincts are as troubling as those of the jihadists.<br />Priscilla Larkin Harris<br />Ghlin, Belgium</td>

      <td>The focus on lean should have been balanced with a pragmatic view on the extreme cost of idled automotive production lines.</td>
      <td>“Car Makers Collide With Global Chip Shortage” (Page One, Feb. 13) correctly identifies the auto industry’s current supply-chain woes as a self-inflicted wound. From the electronics-manufacturing industry’s point of view, automotive is mostly a low-volume, high-mix customer segment, and it requires buffering through component distributors. Instead, the auto makers’ extreme focus on cost optimization and lean manufacturing meant eliminating these valuable supply-chain partners. The focus on lean should have been balanced with a pragmatic view on the extreme cost of idled automotive production lines. To shut down production lines for $80,000 vehicles because of a missing $2 microcontroller is catastrophic.<br />Products like semiconductors that have longer lead times and large production lot sizes need distribution for efficient buffering between the manufacturers and end customers. Semiconductors have extremely long and complex production cycles that can range from 10 to 26 weeks. Once a production cycle is begun, large quantities of the same product flow in lots through a semiconductor-manufacturing line that pop out at the end in a burst. Highest volume customers (e.g., smartphone manufacturers) can efficiently receive product directly from a manufacturer. For lower volume, high-mix customers like automotive and industrial, distributors buffer inventory to match a customer’s demand for a steady flow of product to the long production cycles of semiconductor manufacturing and also provide many value-added services.<br />The collaboration between authorized distributors and automotive manufacturers presents a wealth of opportunity to minimize future disruptions.<br />David Loftus<br />President and CEO</td>

Others noticed the rising stock and started buying too, sending shares to more than $100. Then everyone piled in until it hit around $500 at its peak. Sound familiar?  GameStop ? AMC? Nope. It was RCA, pumped by the so-called Radio Pool in 1928-29.<br />Pump-and-dump schemes and roving gangs of investors are an age-old problem. In the 1930s, Congress made these stock pools illegal.

I’m happy we did this. I thank President Putin that we did this. And more than this I won’t add because that was the Russian request.”<br />The deal was first reported by a U.S.-based blogger, Richard Silverstein, and the  New York Times ,  who said that Israel secretly agreed to pay Russia to send vaccines to Syria to secure the return of the Israeli woman.<br />Israel has described the exchange as a standard prisoner swap. The prime minister didn’t deny buying the Russian vaccines, however, and a person familiar with the deal said that was part of the arrangement.</td>

      <td>International investigators ignore the lab-leak theory but investigate frozen fish.</td>
      <td>Chinese policy makers have been floating an implausible theory: The novel coronavirus didn’t originate in China but was imported from Europe. That’s what a former chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention told an academic conference last fall. One theory is the virus rode into Wuhan on frozen-food packaging.<br />This month the World Health Organization visited China to investigate the origins of the virus. A member of the WHO delegation said it's “possible that a frozen carcass could have been shipped” to China and introduced the virus, giving some validation to the food-packaging idea. Reporting has suggested that China required the WHO to agree it would investigate the food hypothesis as a condition of entering Wuhan. By lending credence to this improbable theory, WHO is damaging trust in the important project of figuring out where the virus originated.<br />The most common culprit cited by Chinese officials is frozen salmon, though officials have also suggested the virus may have hitched a ride on frozen cod, pig heads or other products. In response, Beijing has suspended imports of some food products and introduced inspections and tests of frozen food, which has frequently held up imports from the U.S. and Europe.<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration weighed in last week with a forceful statement. “There is no credible evidence of food or food packaging associated with or as a likely source of viral transmission,” the Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcocksaid in a Covid update on Thursday.<br />Other scientific bodies have reached similar conclusions. The International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods has stated: “Despite the billions of meals and food packages handled since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, to date there has not been any evidence that food, food packaging or food handling is a source or important transmission route.” More than 100 million cases of Covid have been diagnosed world-wide and, outside China, not a single case has been traced to food or food packaging.</td>

      <td>Lawmakers criticize Biden administration report that names no new Nord Stream 2 sanctions targets</td>
      <td>The State Department in a report to Congress didn’t name new companies as targets for sanctions related to an $11 billion pipeline designed to transmit Russian natural gas to Germany, allowing work on the pipeline to continue unabated for now.<br />Some Republican lawmakers criticized the State Department over the Nord Stream 2 report, which was required by Congress, and both Republicans and a key Democrat requested an explanation of the administration’s position.<br />The Trump administration, urged by Congress, signed laws in 2019 and 2020 that halted the pipeline’s construction for more than a year until its resumption earlier this month. The Biden administration has called the project a “bad deal,” but Nord Stream 2 is shaping into a pressure point between the new administration and a bipartisan Congressional coalition that has assailed the project.<br />The report was expected to provide a list of companies involved in pipeline construction and are therefore subject to U.S. sanctions. Instead, the State Department named two entities previously sanctioned by the Trump administration—the main pipe-laying vessel and its owner—along with 18 companies, mostly insurers, that already have left or were leaving the project.<br />The failure to name any new targets for sanctions allows the work to continue while also providing the administration with time for discussions with Germany about the project and to formulate its own policy on the pipeline.</td>

Commercial activity largely sputtered to a halt. “For Rent” signs have proliferated on the once-bustling seaside avenues of this city.<br />The opening up and use of what officials are calling green passports, which allow people to enter gyms and hotels and eventually embark on quarantine-free travel, set up a test for one of the most closely watched countries during the pandemic: Can Israel return to relative normalcy without slipping back into peak infection rates and overwhelming its healthcare system?<br />To strike that balance, officials are warning those who shun the national vaccination campaign that they will be shut out of everyday activities. “Anyone who does not get vaccinated will be left behind,” Israel’s health minister Yuli Edelstein said.</td>

Civil-rights and policing groups sent letters to lawmakers describing him as a leader who would balance their interests.</td>

      <td>Conventional wisdom says the best time to go to business school is in your 20s, after working a few years, perhaps while you are still single and trying to move up in the corporate world.<br />Some M.B.A. students beg to differ. In fact, the experiences of graduates with untraditional or non-business backgrounds show that the degree can help mid-career individuals parlay expertise in areas such as science or the military into business leadership. It also can help in the transition from the public to the private sector at any age.<br />Many M.B.A. programs have sought candidates from different backgrounds in recent years, especially as businesses look to hire a more diverse workforce. Schools have said that waiving their standardized-test requirements, including the GMAT exam, for this year removes a hurdle for untraditional students. Some top programs also have plans to diversify applicant pipelines.<br />In 2020, the percentage of two-year M.B.A. applicants with six or more years of work experience increased to 32% from 17% in 2019, according to the nonprofit Graduate Management Admission Council. The share of candidates with 10 or more years of experience rose to 19% from 7% a year ago.<br />Applications to M.B.A. programs, in general, soared this past year as students from a variety of backgrounds sought places to ride out the pandemic-induced recession. Students typically flock to business schools and other graduate programs during economic downturns to sit out a tough job market and gain credentials. M.B.A. program applications had fallen for five straight years because of a hot job market and high tuition costs.</td>

      <td>GameStop  mania has spilled over into a popular exchange-traded fund, as the WallStreetBets craze reaches beyond shares favored on social media.<br />The fund,  State Street ’s  SPDR S&P Retail ETF, was created in 2006 to give investors broad exposure to mall-store firms. Its shares have surged 23% this year, far outstripping a 4% gain in the S&P 500, despite the uncertain outlook for retail. Behind those gains are the traders who congregate on social-media platforms such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum and whose enthusiasm has turned this mundane investment into a roller coaster.<br />On Jan. 27, GameStop soared 135%, driven by events such as Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeting “Gamestonk.” The State Street fund jumped 42% the same day. The next day, GameStop shares tumbled 44% and the fund, known by its ticker XRT, dropped about 9%.<br />On Jan. 28, the fund suffered its largest single-day outflow in more than a decade, according to FactSet. Three-quarters of the money in the fund flowed out, amounting to $506 million in redemptions, driven in part by what some analysts describe as a frantic rush by traders to liquidate the ETF—whose price at times traded at discounts rarely seen in this part of the world—to get their hands on underlying GameStop shares.<br />The whipsaw trading highlights how the mania in WallStreetBets favorites like GameStop can drive pricing in other investments, in this case one typically preferred by investors seeking portfolio diversification and targeted exposure to industry sectors. GameStop shares, long viewed as an also-ran by many investors in a world dominated by  Amazon  and  Costco ,  at one point this year accounted for 20% of the State Street fund.</td>

      <td>If yields rise more quickly and unpredictably than expected, that would be disruptive to assets like shares, many analysts say</td>
      <td>The sharp increase this month in U.S. government-bond yields is sending tremors through stocks, weighing on hot technology shares and some other sectors while prompting a deeper reassessment of the threat posed by rising interest rates.<br />For now, many investors remain optimistic because the reasons behind the bond retrenchment are mostly positive. Stuck near historic lows for most of last year, Treasury yields have climbed in recent months along with investors’ expectations for a strong economic rebound, driven in part by more debt-financed government spending.<br />Rising yields, which result from falling bond prices, often reflect investors’ expectations of faster growth and an accompanying rise in inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of bonds’ fixed payments and can eventually lead the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. More government borrowing also can boost yields by increasing the supply of bonds. Though many investors are keeping an eye on inflation data, analysts and portfolio managers say so far there is little reason to believe price levels will rise enough to prompt the Fed to raise rates any time soon, which looms as perhaps the greatest risk to major stock indexes.<br />“The market has principally been saying, ‘Hooray, the pandemic is coming under control and the economy is starting to grow again,’” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, an investment adviser and brokerage firm. “But now we’re actually starting to see the consequences of that in the form of higher rates, and I think the market’s processing that.”<br />As of Friday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note stood at 1.344%, up from 1.157% just five trading sessions earlier and roughly 0.9% at the start of the year.</td>

And District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine, a Democrat, “is investigating whether former President Trump or any other individual violated district law and illegally incited violence on Jan. 6,” according to a spokeswoman, though his authority is more limited.<br />Prosecutors would face clear challenges in bringing any case, according to former prosecutors and experts.<br />Tom Firestone, a lawyer with Baker & McKenzie LLP and former assistant U.S. attorney in New York, said prosecutors would have to consider several factors, including whether Mr. Trump was engaged in constitutionally protected political speech or instead crossed a line that prompted supporters to commit violence. “If you look at his speech, there’s evidence that both sides could use,” Mr. Firestone said.<br />Other important considerations would include Mr. Trump’s intent, what he knew about his supporters’ intentions, and whether the attack on the Capitol was reasonably foreseeable under the circumstances. “I think all of these factors would make it a difficult prosecution, though not an impossible one,” Mr. Firestone said.</td>

      <td>An 18th major title has the Serbian star just two trophies away from rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal</td>
      <td>Tennis will have to reckon with Novak Djokovic, sooner or later, because he’s charging in the rear view. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal may have come of age as generational rivals, captivating the sport, and harnessing much of its good will, but as the years go on, and bodies weary, it may be Djokovic—the third man in, and a historic talent himself—who stands alone.<br />On Sunday, Djokovic won the Australian Open men’s final, his 18th major tournament victory, rolling over Daniil Medvedev 7-5, 6-2, 6-2, putting him two majors behind Federer and Nadal, who both have 20. At 33, Djokovic is about a year younger than Nadal, and more than six years younger than Federer, who will be 40 when the U.S. Open rolls around in late summer. Djokovic owns lifetime winning records against both—he’s 29-27 against Nadal, 27-23 against Federer.<br />Nothing should be assumed in tennis—injuries can happen at any time, and the mental stress of an individual, globe-circling sport isn’t insignificant. Great players can and have suddenly walked away. It will be interesting to see what condition Federer is in when he returns this spring, after nearly a year away, recuperating from a knee injury, and if there’s a chance he can add a couple more. There’s part of me that thinks Nadal could keep dropping in and winning the French Open into his late 30s and early 40s, like some kind of clay-court version of Tom Brady—or better yet, in the way the aging golfer Fred Couples stays relevant at Augusta, because he knows the joint so well.<br />But if Djokovic continues to power along, staying healthy, he may soon be atop the major mountaintop.<br />“The question that comes out of this match is simple,” John McEnroe said on ESPN after Djokovic prevailed Sunday. “Is he going to be the greatest player that ever lived, or is it going to be Roger or Rafa?”</td>

      <td>The pandemic travel bust that hit tourism-dependent economies may only just be beginning.<br />Tourist destinations from Thailand to Iceland had been hoping Covid-19 vaccines would allow countries to reopen their borders and drive a much-needed recovery in 2021. Now, with vaccine rollouts delayed in some places and new virus strains appearing, it is looking more likely that international travel could be stalled for years.<br />After declaring that 2020 was the worst year for tourism on record, with one billion fewer international arrivals, the United Nations World Tourism Organization says prospects for a 2021 rebound have worsened. In October, 79% of experts polled by the agency believed a 2021 rebound was possible. Only 50% said they believed that in January, and some 41% didn’t think travel would reach pre-pandemic levels until 2024 or beyond.<br />James Sowane, who owns a transportation company catering to tourists in Fiji, called a staff meeting earlier this month and told employees to start looking for other jobs. He recently took advantage of a government-assistance program and had brought back some laid-off workers, optimistic that vaccines could spark a travel rebound as early as April.<br />But now Mr. Sowane doesn’t think tourists will return until next year, and he and his wife can’t afford to keep paying wages at their company, Pacific Destinations Fiji. He is borrowing from his bank to keep a few core employees.</td>

The U.K. has given the third-highest number of vaccination doses per 100 people, according to Oxford University-based OurWorldInData.org, behind Israel and the United Arab Emirates.<br />The fast pace of inoculations, combined with the passage of a Brexit deal at the end of last year, after a period when it appeared the U.K. could crash out of the European Union without one, has led some investors to reassess their expectations of U.K. assets.<br />Hedge funds had largely neutral net positions on sterling’s prospects at the end of last year.

Those trends have pushed many miners to expand into the metals used to make batteries, such as lithium, cobalt, graphite and nickel.<br />The last big secular change Mr. Davis said he bet on was China in 2002, when he became chief executive of Xstrata.

He now trails Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal by just two for the men’s all-time Slam record.<br />“We’re talking about some cyborgs of tennis,” Medvedev said. “In a good way.”<br />The emphatic win gave Djokovic, 33, an unparalleled ninth Australian Open title in 17 visits to the tournament that he has always called his favorite.

Local governments from New York to Seattle have enforced rules capping delivery-app fees, in an effort to rein in restaurants’ costs while the health crisis keeps people home.</td>

      <td>The Federal Reserve predicates its easy money policies in part on the fact that its favorite measure of inflation has run more than a half percentage point below its goal for several years.<br />With inflation so low for so long, the thinking goes, the Fed can hold interest rates very low for a while to help boost the economy as it recovers from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.<br />This raises an important question: Is the central bank thinking about inflation properly?<br />The Fed defines its inflation target in terms of consumer prices, such as those we pay for cars, toothpaste and haircuts. But in recent decades, prices have often climbed much faster for investment assets, such as homes and stocks, and twice led to booms and busts followed by recessions.<br />If the Fed does run into problems with the low interest rates it has helped to engineer, it might be because of asset prices and not consumer prices.</td>

      <td>Data may mean a second dose of the vaccine is unnecessary, potentially freeing up limited supply</td>
      <td>Covid-19 survivors who have gotten a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine are generating immune responses that might render a second shot unnecessary, potentially freeing up limited vaccine supply for more people, several new research papers suggest.<br />The research, while preliminary, found that the previously infected people generated protection against the disease quickly and at dramatically higher levels after a first shot of the current two-shot regimens when compared with people who were vaccinated but hadn’t been sick.<br />“Everyone should get vaccinated. Not everybody needs two shots,” said Viviana Simon, a professor of microbiology at New York’s Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and an author on one study. “As long as we can’t deliver as much vaccine to everybody who wants it, I think it’s an important consideration.”<br />The research, which has been posted on preprint servers but not peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal, comes as other findings into the two-shot regimen to healthy members of the general population highlight immune benefits after the first injection. On Friday, researchers in Israel reported a single shot of the vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  is 85% effective in preventing symptomatic disease 15 to 28 days after being administered.<br />Late-stage clinical trials of two-dose vaccines by Pfizer and BioNTech, as well as  Moderna Inc.,  have shown their shots to be safe and highly protective against Covid-19 when given through two doses spaced several weeks apart. However, Pfizer’s trial excluded individuals with symptomatic Covid-19, and Moderna’s left out people with a previously known infection, prompting researchers to see how immune systems in people previously sick responded.</td>

After successfully pumping out direct-to-video sequels to beloved classics like “Bambi” and “The Lion King,” Mr. Chapek sensed an opportunity with “Air Bud,” a 1997 hit film about a basketball-playing dog.<br />DVDs of the “Air Bud” universe proliferated for 10 sequels and spinoffs released between 1998 and 2013. “Space Buddies,” “Seventh Inning Fetch,” “Snow Buddies” and other titles earned millions for the company. Though nearly all the “Disney Buddies” films were released straight to home video, Mr. Chapek spent extra on orchestral scores, elaborate marketing campaigns and other embellishments usually reserved for major theatrical releases.<br />Today, the same instincts are benefiting Mr. Chapek as he shepherds Disney’s transition into the streaming age. Much as he did then, Mr. Chapek today must navigate considerable disruption and bridge the old—a library of classic films, TV shows and franchises—with the new: a streaming service considered by Wall Street to be the lifeblood and future of the world’s largest entertainment company.<br />“Everything he’s doing are things that we did, only in the home-entertainment area,” said Robert Vince, chief executive of Air Bud Entertainment and a producer on all of the “Buddies” films.</td>

      <td>A well-meaning social-media campaign to free young women kidnapped by Boko Haram galvanized rescue efforts—and may have spurred the jihadist group to expand its use of gender violence</td>
      <td>On the evening of April 14, 2014, a band of gunmen stormed into a girls boarding school in the northeast Nigerian town of Chibok and carried away more than 200 students who had been preparing for their graduation exams. The young women were taken to the remote forest hideout of a little-known Islamist sect named Boko Haram.<br />For weeks, almost no one seemed to notice the students were missing. Then the news went viral on  Twitter ,  prompting some of the world’s most recognizable people—Pope Francis, Kim Kardashian, The Rock, Michelle Obama—to fire off a hashtag that lighted up billions of phones: #BringBackOurGirls. Those four words quickly demonstrated the power of social media to advance a distant cause. The girls became a global priority. To free them, a number of the world’s most powerful countries sent their armed forces, drones, satellites and sophisticated surveillance equipment. And then, just as quickly, Twitter’s hive mind swarmed onto its next viral cause, the Ice Bucket Challenge, and never returned.<br />Yet those few days of tweets lighted a fuse that continues to burn years later. The rescue mission launched in 2014 has quietly and covertly evolved into a military deployment across four West African countries. Nigeria’s military, U.S. diplomats and terrorism specialists still express bewilderment that a short-lived series of tweets so profoundly shaped the conflict with Boko Haram and other jihadist groups, which continue to kidnap children for fame, footsoldiers and ransom.<br />Through hundreds of interviews with officials involved in rescue efforts and 20 of the Chibok girls who won their freedom, we found a yearslong trail of far-ranging yet unintended outcomes that neither the advocates nor the cynics who dismissed the campaign as “slacktivism” could have foreseen.<br />The frenzied international coverage inspired both a race to free the women and a shift in Boko Haram’s tactics. Within months, the group was boasting that it had kidnapped vastly more young women, ransoming some and dispatching others as its first female suicide bombers. “The hashtag unwittingly provided Boko Haram with a road map to use gender violence to further its global brand,” says Nigerian writer Tricia Adaobi Nwaubani, who has interviewed more than 200 of the Chibok families.</td>

At the same time, any statement on a fresh round of moderation provokes some to point out objectionable content that remains. Like any question of editorial or legal judgment, the results are guaranteed to displease someone, somewhere—including Congress, which this week called the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to a hearing on March 25 to discuss misinformation on their platforms.<br />For many services, this has gone beyond a matter of user experience, or growth rates, or even ad revenue. It’s become an existential crisis. While dialing up moderation won’t solve all of a platform’s problems, a look at the current winners and losers suggests that not moderating enough is a recipe for extinction.</td>

A key target: healthcare, a trillion-dollar industry many say is saddled with inefficiencies that some tech advocates say AI could cure.<br />A decade later, reality has fallen short of that promise. IBM is now exploring the sale of Watson Health, a unit whose marquee product was supposed to help doctors diagnose and cure cancer.<br />IBM spent several billion dollars on acquisitions to build up Watson. Former senior IBM executive John Kelly once touted the initiative as a “bet the ranch” move. It didn’t live up to the hype. Watson Health has struggled for market share in the U.S. and abroad and currently isn’t profitable.<br />Alphabet Inc.’s  Google DeepMind unit, which famously developed a Go-playing algorithm that vanquished a champion human player in 2016, later launched several healthcare-related initiatives focused on chronic conditions. It also has lost money in recent years and run into privacy concerns over how health data was being collected.</td>

      <td>Stan Lee co-created Iron Man, the Hulk, the X-Men, and other Marvel Comics superheroes who’ve thrilled movie audiences and become pop-culture icons. Or did he?<br />Generations of fans have applauded Mr. Lee as the prime mover behind Marvel’s success—not least because Mr. Lee, who died at the age of 95 in 2018, always said he was. But a new biography suggests Mr. Lee may have claimed more credit than he deserved for creating Marvel’s signature characters, and that the bulk of the credit may belong to the artists with whom he collaborated, notably Jack Kirby, who died in 1994.<br />“The image of Stan as a real-life superhero is just not the case,” said Abraham Riesman, the author of “True Believer: The Rise and Fall of Stan Lee.” The recently published book—for which Mr. Riesman conducted 150-plus interviews, many with people close to Mr. Lee, and delved into his archives and thousands of pages of documents—portrays Mr. Lee as a gifted editor, scriptwriter and promoter who nonetheless overstated his accomplishments.<br />Part of the ambiguity stems from the “Marvel Method” Mr. Lee and his artists used, Mr. Riesman argues. They would have informal discussions to outline a story and its characters, sometimes in bare-bones terms, and then the artist drew the pages, shaping the story and adding or changing elements. Mr. Lee then wrote the characters’ dialogue and narration.<br />The question is how much he contributed in those first discussions when the core concepts for new characters were born. There’s little documentation and no hard evidence that the central ideas came from him, Mr. Riesman said. “It’s just Stan said that he created these characters and people believed him.” And, he notes, Mr. Lee had difficulty coming up with successful ideas after Marvel, which is now owned by Disney.</td>

The demands of full-time jobs and shifting school schedules have many working parents turning to their own mothers and fathers for relief.<br />We reached out to several Wall Street Journal readers who shared their experiences. Here are some edited excerpts.<br /><br />Abilene, Texas<br />We try to have a routine and ritual for our grandchildren. I will bring them to my office and they do the same things that they always do—take everything out of my desk and set it up and have a great time. I teach in the College of Business at Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, and sometimes I’ll bring them to play on the lawn or to chase ducks by the pond. We are not keeping them on an extended basis, like so many of the people in the article, but we try to keep them entertained and having fun. Intermittently this past year, the grandchildren would stay with us for three to five days to give their parents a break. After reading the article, I was impressed by the people who would pick up and move across the country and retire just so they can help their children with the grandkids. That’s an extraordinary commitment. I’m genuinely grateful for my children and grandchildren but I don’t know if I’d be able to do that, especially since my wife and I still have our full-time jobs.</td>

But teachers in rural Mexico are a key voting bloc.<br />Critics of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador say vaccinating teachers ahead of all doctors is the latest evidence of how the leftist president is playing politics with vaccinations in a country with the third-highest official Covid-19 death toll in the world, close to 180,000. And instead of having state health workers leading the effort, per usual protocol, Mr. López Obrador’s administration is using officials from its welfare arm, “Servants of the Nation,” recognizable by the vests they wear with Mexico’s national emblem.<br />Campeche is one of several key states that hold midterm elections in June. Polls show that Mr. López Obrador’s Morena party has a chance to unseat the former ruling PRI, which has ruled Campeche since the late 1920s. While many countries have made teachers a priority for vaccination programs during the coronavirus pandemic, they aren’t usually ahead of healthcare workers.<br />Inside hospitals, healthcare workers have been furious that the government was inoculating teachers while nearly half of the state’s doctors and nurses were still waiting.</td>

      <td>Cardinal Robert Sarah of Guinea is often mentioned as a possible future pontiff</td>
      <td>ROME—Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Cardinal Robert Sarah as head of the Vatican’s office for liturgy, removing an outspoken conservative and possible future pope from the ranks of Vatican leadership.<br />The Holy See Press Office announced Saturday that Cardinal Sarah had stepped down. No successor has been named.<br />The cardinal submitted his resignation as required by church law when he turned 75 on June 15 of last year. But the pope frequently lets cardinals serve two or three years past that age, though not past 80.<br />In accepting Cardinal Sarah’s resignation, the pope has removed a subordinate out of step with his approach to liturgy, homosexuality and relations with the Muslim world. The cardinal is a hero to many conservative Catholics, some of whom see him as a future pontiff. He will still be able to vote in a conclave to elect a pope until he turns 80.<br />Last year, the cardinal raised controversy with a book widely interpreted as an attempt to influence Pope Francis’ decision on whether to allow the ordination of married men as priests. The episode led to  embarrassment for the cardinal when retired Pope Benedict XVI asked to have his name removed as the book’s co-author.</td>

      <td>Tech billionaire joined with researchers to track infections; effort explored coronavirus immunity</td>
      <td>When Covid-19 shut down the U.S. economy in March, Elon Musk had a rocket to launch.<br />The billionaire’s space exploration venture, SpaceX, was planning to blast a crewed spacecraft into the sky in May and wanted to stay on schedule. That meant finding a way to keep facilities safely open and limit the spread of Covid-19, a challenge when tests were in short supply.<br />To monitor the prevalence of the virus among SpaceX workers nationwide, Mr. Musk and the rocket company’s top medical executive worked with doctors and academic researchers to build an antibody-testing program. More than 4,000 SpaceX workers volunteered for monthly blood tests.<br />This week the group published its findings, which suggest that a certain threshold of antibodies might provide people lasting protection against the virus. Mr. Musk is listed as a co-author of the peer-reviewed study, which appears in the journal Nature Communications.<br />“People can have antibodies, but it doesn’t mean they are going to be immune” to Covid-19, said Galit Alter, a co-author of the study who is a member of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard. Individuals who experienced fewer, milder Covid-19 symptoms generated fewer antibodies and were therefore less likely to meet the threshold for longer-term immunity, the study found.</td>

      <td>The Los Angeles jewelry designer is thriving after a year of pandemic belt-tightening and a boost from the vice president, a fan of her pearls and other pieces</td>
      <td>Off Brand is a thrice-monthly column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />WHEN THE REALITY of the pandemic hit California last March, jewelry designer Irene Neuwirth found herself in tears, walking along Venice Beach with her boyfriend. Like so many business owners, she was grappling with difficult decisions. Her eponymous company had just endured the loss of its most important vendor, Barneys New York, to bankruptcy. The impending shutdown, which would close her two Los Angeles stores, spelled further disaster for the fashion industry, particularly independent designers. She remembers thinking, “Our business is going to go down, we’re going to have to let people go…I can’t do it.” That day, she resolved to stop paying herself and recommit to the business in a more personal way.<br />That meant reaching out to individual customers, hand-writing letters of thanks for every piece sold, and focusing on e-commerce. She continued to hand-draw each design for the quirky, colorful, stone-heavy pieces that have enjoyed the status of luxurious cult items for 18 years. Not only did Ms. Neuwirth’s 24-person business stay strong, it wound up having one of its best years on record. Direct-to-consumer website orders, which previously had accounted for only 20% of her business, rose to up to 60%. With a combination of hustle, belt-tightening and hard work, Irene Neuwirth became a pandemic success story.<br />Some serious luck also played a role, in the form of attention from Vice President Kamala Harris. While Ms. Neuwirth’s brand has no shortage of high-profile Hollywood fans—Busy Philipps and Maya Rudolph, to name a few—Ms. Harris catapulted Ms. Neuwirth to history-book levels of prominence. She showcased Irene Neuwirth designs at several major events: a “gumball” pearl-and-chain necklace at the 2020 Democratic National Convention; a pearl-and-turquoise necklace at a vice-presidential debate; sparkling custom diamond-and-pearl earrings for the evening of the inauguration.<br />Ms. Harris wears pieces by other jewelry designers, too. As a former Alpha Kappa Alpha member from her Howard University days, she’s especially partial to pearls in all forms, which are an important part of the sorority’s symbolism. But the Irene Neuwirth designs are the ones she wears most prominently, over and over.</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—A Russian court denied an appeal by Alexei Navalny, sealing an earlier ruling that would see the prominent Kremlin critic and anticorruption activist spend a lengthy sentence in a penal colony.<br />Mr. Navalny, whose detention in January sparked mass protests that mushroomed into a broader act of defiance against Russian President Vladimir Putin, was sentenced earlier this month for violating the conditions of a suspended sentence from 2014. Mr. Navalny was detained upon returning from Germany, where he spent months recovering from a poison attack that he blames on Mr. Putin. The Kremlin denies any involvement.<br />The rallies, which at one point saw over 40,000 people on the streets of Moscow and thousands more across the country, were met with a sweeping crackdown by the authorities, who detained more than 10,000. While Mr. Navalny’s allies have temporarily suspended large-scale protests until the spring, the protest wave has cemented his position as Mr. Putin’s most vocal critic and a potent threat to the Kremlin leader’s two-decade-old rule.<br />At the hearing on Saturday, Mr. Navalny appeared inside a glass cage for defendants and flashed a “V” sign for victory. He rejected the notion that he was hiding from justice, saying that his whereabouts were publicly known, and he described the legal process as absurd.<br />“If I was hiding, I wouldn’t be standing here in this aquarium,” Mr. Navalny told the court.</td>

      <td>Scientists say the world has reached a precarious point in the Covid-19 pandemic, one where conditions are ripe for the rise of more new coronavirus variants that could complicate efforts to control the disease.<br />The virus continues to spread rapidly in many parts of the world, even as segments of the population have gained some degree of immunity as a result of having been infected or vaccinated.<br />Scientists say that combination—high rates of viral transmission and a partially immunized population—encourages the emergence of variants that are potentially more transmissible or more lethal. More transmission means more opportunities for the virus to evolve, they say.<br />“If everyone has immunity, then you have pretty much no virus circulating and the virus can’t adapt,” University of Bern molecular epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft said, adding that if no one within a population has immunity, then there’s no pressure on the virus to evolve. “That middle part, where you have a partially vaccinated population, or a partially immune population with lots of virus circulating, that’s kind of your danger point,” she said.<br />New variants could also reduce the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments and lead to reinfections among people who have already recovered from Covid-19, scientists say. The key to minimizing these problems, they say, lies with social distancing and other measures to reduce contagion as well as with ramping up vaccination efforts, which have lagged behind in many places.</td>

      <td>The months since tennis returned to action last fall have been one long experiment for players—in preparation, in logistics, and in not going crazy. They have been locked in hotel rooms, torn up training plans, and bounced from bubble to bubble. This winter, they traveled halfway around the world for an Australian Open that wasn’t guaranteed to happen.<br />But somewhere in all the uncertainty, Japan’s Naomi Osaka became the surest thing in tennis. Practically undefeated in any competitive match since the coronavirus hiatus last summer, Osaka on Saturday won the Australian Open by beating American Jennifer Brady 6-4, 6-3 in Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena.<br />Osaka, 23, now has four Grand Slam titles to her name, adding to the 2018 and 2020 U.S. Opens, plus her win in Australia in 2019. She has never lost a major final.<br />On a women’s circuit that has grown extremely deep—eight of the previous 17 majors had been won by first-time champions—Osaka has turned into a model of consistency. The last woman not named Serena Williams to rack up her fourth major was Maria Sharapova at Roland-Garros in 2012. And she did it without a pandemic dropping into her career.<br />“I think the thing that I’m most proud of is now mentally strong I’ve become. I used to be really up and down,” Osaka said before the final. “The quarantine process and seeing everything that’s going on in the world, for me it put a lot into perspective…I used to weigh my entire existence on if I won or lost a tennis match. That’s just not how I feel any more.”</td>

Panel of Experts that monitors the ban on transfers of weapons to Libya says companies controlled by Mr. Prince provided three aircraft to assist in sending helicopters and military contractors to help Russian-backed Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar in 2019.<br />The plan to send Western mercenaries to Libya developed as foreign weapons and fighters poured into the country in 2019 and 2020 from a variety of outside powers, including Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, deepening a conflict that has been ongoing since 2014, the report says, according to the diplomat.<br />Mr. Prince is likely to be referred to the U.N.’s Sanctions Committee, which could order a freeze on his assets or a travel ban, according to the New York-based diplomat and a former official with knowledge of the situation. The permanent members of the Security Council, including the U.S., Russia, or China, could veto any potential sanctions against Mr. Prince, who has had dealings with all three countries.<br />“Erik Prince had absolutely nothing to do with any operation in Libya in 2019, or at any other time,” a spokesman for Mr. Prince said in an email.</td>

They closed Feb. 3 at $92.41.<br />Mr. Gill appeared at a congressional hearing about the GameStop frenzy on Thursday where he was asked by a lawmaker if he thought the stock was still appealing. “I do find that it’s an attractive investment at this price point,” he responded.</td>

      <td>Partisans on both sides during the Trump Presidency used immigration to bludgeon each other, but President Biden has a fresh opening for bipartisan cooperation. Now we’ll find out if Democrats want to reform immigration or keep using it as a political cudgel.<br />Mr. Biden made an opening offer Thursday with a bill by New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez and California Rep. Linda Sanchez. The bill is dead on arrival in Congress since it doesn’t improve border security and provides more or less blanket legalization to the country’s 11 million or so undocumented immigrants. “We must not start with concessions out of the gate. We are not going to start with two million undocumented people instead of 11 million,” Mr. Menendez said. “We will never win an argument that we don’t have the courage to make.”<br />GOP restrictionists during the Trump Presidency also introduced immigration bills that were essentially political statements. They went nowhere. The lesson for Democrats is they won’t win an argument in Congress or the public without making concessions to the other party and immigration realities.<br />Start with the bill’s eight-year path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and three years for some farm workers and young adults who were brought to the country illegally as children. No matter what restrictionists say, most of these folks will never be deported. Many have been here for decades and contribute significantly to the economy.<br />The young adults known as Dreamers are particularly sympathetic since they didn’t knowingly break immigration laws and live in legal limbo. Barack Obama granted them temporary legal status and work permits. As we’ve argued, he didn’t have the legal authority to do so since the Constitution grants Congress power to regulate immigration. But Congress also has a moral imperative to grant a reprieve after the government invited them to come out of the shadows.</td>

      <td>His CFPB pick wants a new agency to control politics and speech.</td>
      <td>In our age of a powerful administrative state and weak Congress, some of the most consequential government officials are the little-known heads of alphabet-soup federal agencies. One of them is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which was designed as its own regulatory fiefdom insulated from accountability. So it’s worrying that President Biden’s nominee to head the agency wants the administrative state to extend its reach into political speech.<br />Mr. Biden sent the nomination of Rohit Chopra, an Elizabeth Warren protégé and commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, to the Senate last week. Senators who want to understand Mr. Chopra’s thinking about the role of regulators in American democracy might crack open a report he co-authored in 2018 for the Roosevelt Institute. It envisions an unaccountable Washington “corruption” czar writing rules, issuing fines and working his will over politicians, think tanks and nonprofits.<br />If that sounds constitutionally suspect, well, it comes with the progressive territory. The Supreme Court ruled last year that the CFPB’s design was unconstitutional because its director, who is appointed by the President for a five-year term, could only be removed for cause.<br />The Court said giving a regulator that much power “clashes with constitutional structure.” But that’s nothing compared to Mr. Chopra’s proposed “Public Integrity Protection Agency” (PIPA), where the director would serve as many as 10 years, “subject to removal proceedings similar to that of a federal judge”—that is, effectively untouchable by the elected branches.<br />Unlike the CFPB, which regulates commerce and loans, Mr. Chopra’s even-less-accountable PIPA would regulate core political activities. The report proposes new restrictions on advocacy, declaring that the “use of think tanks and other nonprofit organizations to further the economic interests of its benefactors through policy research should be impermissible.”</td>

      <td>Finding an open appointment to get the Covid-19 vaccine was a headache, so 90-year-old Fran Goldman wasn’t going to be deterred by some snow. The walk was three miles, each direction. She dressed in layers and grabbed walking sticks. “It was not easy going,” Ms. Goldman told the Seattle Times. “It was challenging.”<br />Did we mention she had a hip replaced last year? But a trek in the snow will be worth it for two great-grandchildren. “I can’t wait to be able to hold them,” Ms. Goldman told the newspaper. Now there’s an antidote to the articles about public skepticism of the vaccines. Polls last year showing hesitancy were noteworthy, but two months into America’s vaccination program, the story is about demand.<br />Here’s another one, though not quite as uplifting. In Florida, which is prioritizing people 65 and older, two women aged 34 and 44 went to an Orange County immunization site “dressed up as grannies,” an official said Thursday. That made national headlines, although it’s not clear whether it was exaggerated.<br />Body-camera video released Friday shows little disguise, but both of the women had face masks and glasses, and one was wearing a gray hat. That said, the women “had altered their years of birth on their vaccination registrations to bypass the state system,” the Orlando Sentinel reported. They apparently had already received a first vaccine dose but were denied the second and issued trespass warnings.<br />A heroic story and a malicious one. Yet both are good signs of vaccine demand, since ending this pandemic depends on getting millions more shots into millions more arms.</td>

But his Iran strategy will test whether appeasement with friends produces better outcomes than standing strong alone.<br />Mr. Trump upset Iran, and America’s European allies, by leaving the 2015 nuclear deal and embarking on a “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign. Mr. Biden has said Washington would return to the accord and lift sanctions if Tehran returned to compliance, while the Islamic Republic demanded the inverse. Someone has to blink.<br />The White House hasn’t given in entirely, but this week wasn’t encouraging. On Thursday Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. is committed to resurrecting the nuclear deal after a meeting with his French, German and British counterparts. Later, the U.S. accepted a European offer to mediate with the Iranians, who have yet to respond.<br />Tehran ran circles around Barack Obama’s negotiators, many of whom have returned to the Biden Administration, so it wouldn’t be surprising if Iran now agrees to talks. Some informal negotiations are inevitable, but this was an especially bad week for the U.S. to take the plunge.<br />After rockets hit a U.S. base in Iraq this week, killing a contractor and wounding nine others, including a U.S. service member, the State Department vowed that the U.S. would “hold accountable those responsible.” An Iran-backed militia, with Tehran’s implicit or explicit consent, is almost certainly to blame. Yet the U.S. has responded with a major concession on Iran sanctions that will help empower such groups. Tehran will reasonably think Mr. Biden is so eager for talks that he’ll ignore attacks on Americans.</td>

We are committed to the @LATimes.”<br />When Mr. Soon-Shiong acquired the Times, the San Diego Union-Tribune and a handful of weeklies from  Tribune Publishing Co. , then called Tronc Inc., in 2018, it was met with great fanfare from staff and media watchers after years of turmoil and downsizing at the publications. At the time, he said that the sale represented the beginning of a new era and that he intended to do what it took to make the business viable for the next 100 years.<br />He has since grown dissatisfied with the news organization’s slow expansion of its digital audience and its substantial losses, the people said. He also has increasingly come to believe that the Los Angeles Times and San Diego Union-Tribune—together known as the California Times company—would be better served if they were part of a larger media group, they said.</td>

      <td>To follow the pianist into his thoughts can deliver a view from ‘inside of the music.’</td>
      <td>Essay collections don’t get much honor in the book industry, but I have a weakness for them. A compendium of unrelated or loosely related essays by an author you admire allows you to read it when you feel inclined without the discipline of following a book-length argument. Miscellanies by musicians and music critics are a particular favorite of mine, but good ones are rare. The tenor Ian Bostridge published a fine collection, “A Singer’s Notebook,” in 2011, and the critic and composer Robin Holloway’s “On Music: Essays and Diversions,” from 2003, contains some terrific criticism. Before that there is Samuel Lipman’s 1992 “Music and More” and Andrew Porter’s several collections from the 1970s and ’80s.<br />I was therefore eager to read Stephen Hough’s “Rough Ideas: Reflections on Music and More.” Mr. Hough (pronounced huff), a British pianist and an accomplished interpreter of a wide array of classical works, is one of a very few gifted musicians who are capable of writing with clarity and wit.<br />“Rough Ideas” is a gathering of Mr. Hough’s writings on music and performance, and a few on religion. “Many of the reflections in this book,” he explains, “germinated from articles first published in newspapers . . . and magazines” and from blog posts at the Daily Telegraph’s website. Presumably as a consequence of this germination, the pieces include no reference to the place and date of their original publication—a slight annoyance. Indeed, many of the essays, he writes elsewhere, were “unfinished musings on scraps of paper or saved as files on the go on my iPhone” until he used them for this collection.<br />Mr. Hough reminds me a little of Saul Bellow’s character Moses Herzog, who can’t stop scribbling his thoughts about everything, day and night. Do we really need a squib about Mr. Hough’s elderly Russian landlady who made a wonderful meal of beef stroganoff but who wouldn’t give him the recipe because, as she claimed improbably, “General Stroganoff wrote it out for me himself”? Then again, maybe these ramshackle observations work; “Herzog” is a great book.<br />Part of what makes Mr. Hough’s writing on music so appealing is that he writes as a performer, as if somehow from the inside of the music. His recordings of Johannes Brahms’s piano concertos—he plays the Romantic repertoire cleanly and crisply, without any of the histrionic banging one gets from some other famous performers—and here he writes of these two great concertos with insight. “The Second is the better piece,” he writes, “but the First is the greater piece. . . . The Second is better constructed, better orchestrated; themes are better developed; harmonies are better judged; textures are better balanced—but for me the First has a greater burst of pure, utter, natural genius. Its flame flares with such intensity, and with such promise of more to come ([Brahms] was only twenty-five when he wrote it), that I find myself overwhelmed by it in a way I’m not by the Second, written twenty-two years later.” To me, a non-performer, this sounds exactly right.</td>

      <td>‘When we lower our standards to pretend we know what we don’t know, we diminish the work and misinform society,’ says Prof. John Staddon.</td>
      <td>Durham, N.C.<br />When Prof. John Staddon read the “Statement to the Community Regarding Anti-Racism” sent out by Duke University’s president this summer, he was alarmed. The president, Vincent Price, promised to require “anti-racism and anti-bias training for every member of our faculty, student body, and staff.” To Mr. Staddon, that sounded more like indoctrination than academic inquiry. He responded in an open letter.<br />Mr. Price declared: “I cannot as a white person begin to fully understand the daily fear and pain and oppression that is endemic to the Black experience.” Mr. Staddon’s rejoinder: “Your reassurance is fine as an expression of empathy. I daresay you feel better, and possibly your African American audience does as well. But feelings differ: Unless the discussion can be moved from feelings to facts, no harmony is possible. Empathy, guilt, and good intentions are a dodgy basis for sweeping resolutions.”<br />Mr. Price affirmed that the “hard work before us” requires the community to “take transformative action now toward eliminating the systems of racism and inequality. . . . That starts with a personal transformation and . . . must end in institutional transformation.” Mr. Staddon countered that “this phraseology will strike many as more like psychotherapy or a call to religious conversion than a policy prescription. What are these ‘systems of racism and inequality?’ How have they affected Duke and how is Duke involved in them? Or are they societal concerns and thus the responsibility not of a university but of government, the church, and civil society?”<br />This isn’t the first time Mr. Staddon, 83, a tall, English-born American, has challenged the dogma of his peers. A professor of psychology, neuroscience and biology, he is something of a modern Cassandra, warning for more than three decades of the corruption of academia by political activists. As America becomes woke, his scholarly critiques read like prophecy.</td>

      <td>Toronto<br />If you’re impatient with the pace of Covid-19 vaccine distribution in the U.S., count your blessings. At least you don’t live in Canada. As of Wednesday, my country had administered only 3.52 vaccine doses per 100 people, according to the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data website. The U.S., at 17.00, was doing almost five times as well. The figures were 80.07 in Israel, 25.04 in the U.K. and 5.40 in the European Union.<br />Why is Canada such a laggard among developed nations? The government of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau didn’t negotiate contracts with established drug companies. Rather, it quietly approved a working relationship between Canadian researchers and a Chinese vaccine maker,  CanSino Biologics Inc.  CanSino abandoned its project in August after multiple failures. Ottawa then had to rush through agreements with  Pfizer ,  Moderna and other companies. “I would not have put all our eggs in the basket of China,” Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole told reporters.<br />When Canada and other countries experienced a significant spike in Covid-19 cases last month (which has now subsided), Pfizer reduced its shipment to my country by more than two-thirds for several weeks. Moderna announced that only three-quarters of its vaccines would arrive in Canada during early February.<br />Other options are off the table for now. Although Canada purchased 398 million doses in all, more than 70% are vaccines that haven’t received approval from health officials. The Liberals have pointed fingers at drug companies and provincial governments.</td>

      <td>The grid is designed to shut down, and we’re designing it to shut down more often.</td>
      <td>In 2011 an earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, killing 18,500 people, wiping away neighborhoods, depositing fuels, sludge and toxic chemicals across a considerable landscape. And yet all anybody wanted to talk about was a nuclear power accident that killed nobody. This selective focus may well have contributed to an ill-advised evacuation that led to premature deaths. Angela Merkel thereupon kicked off a world-wide retreat from nuclear power that likely put paid to any hope of meeting the greenhouse targets named in the Paris accord.<br />We may be suffering a similar neurosis now. A cold snap that touches all of Texas with subfreezing temperatures is a once-a-century event, if that, and yet our discussion about it is rapidly becoming a self-defeating mess.<br />Twenty years old is a debate about whether America’s grid resilience is in some kind of crisis. For most Texans, this week’s outages were measured in hours and intermittent. They weren’t the five- and 10-day outages experienced by my neighbors in Rob-and-Laura land three or four times in the past 12 years. Texas water shortages due to burst pipes also have a Northeastern parallel. Suburban New Yorkers who rely on electric well pumps were reduced to flushing their toilets with lake or stream water.<br />Federal data are not much help. From 2013 to 2018, routine interruptions were steady; those attributed to “major events” grew sharply in the final two years. But one thing we’ve long known. By design, U.S. systems generate a lot more downtime (as much as 90% more) than systems in many European countries, where population density makes it cost-effective to bury power lines, where hurricanes and tornadoes are unknown, where forests were tamed or removed centuries ago, and where their idea of wilderness is our idea of a suburb.<br />In covering this week’s Texas outages, the Economist magazine couldn’t decide whether the world’s “climate crisis” or “America’s infrastructure crisis” was the right headline. The reality is more prosaic. Significant freezing episodes led to blackouts at least seven times from 1983 to 2011. In Texas, politicians, utility executives and citizens have repeatedly been asked by nature: Do you want to winterize your grid against rare winter outages or do you prefer lower rates? Lower rates kept winning, at least till now.</td>

Mr. Manchin, a centrist who represents a state that voted twice for former President Donald Trump, is seen as a swing vote in the Senate.<br />“I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget,” Mr. Manchin said in a Friday statement. “For this reason, I cannot support her nomination.”<br />The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Manchin’s statement.<br />The Senate has so far confirmed seven of Mr. Biden’s top nominees, all with bipartisan support. If the White House were to pull Ms. Tanden’s nomination or it failed to reach the 51 votes needed for confirmation, it would mark the first time one of Mr. Biden’s nominees has been blocked.</td>

It’s the first time a civilian will lead the department.<br />Police agencies around the country are rethinking the roles of officers and civilians in public safety, including New York City across the Hudson River.<br />Mr. Fulop, a Democrat who took office in 2013, said the decision to place Ms. Moody at the head of the JCPD, instead of another sworn chief, was motivated by a desire to speed reforms.<br />“Not having a uniformed officer, with biases and relationships of being that uniformed officer for the last 20 or 30 years, is going to ultimately help this city move forward,” Mr. Fulop said. “That different perspective adds value to the entire organization.”</td>

Whether he will remain a significant player politically or not, only time will tell. To say that he “won’t win another national election” is an assertion which I question and find too unsubstantiated to consider valid.<br />It is disturbing that President Biden has signed more than 30 executive orders already, many of them of a very radical nature as is his constant mentioning of systemic racism and white supremacy. In his Inauguration Day speech he claimed he would unify the country, but he’s doing the opposite. His destruction of many thousands of jobs by closing the Keystone XL Pipeline, not following the science and delaying the opening of public schools very clearly show that he is a puppet of the far left of the Democratic Party.<br />There are many millions of Trump followers who are law-abiding citizens, and many not-so-radical Democrats who are now beginning to understand what is going on and know that this radical agenda, woke culture and hypocrisy will get us nowhere good. That, plus the coming tax increases, the underperforming economy, which will come accompanied by a tremendous increase in regulations, will most likely, in a short time, despite the very biased media, make President Trump look good.<br />Abel A.

A San Diego aid group set to receive the migrants said they were told by the government only 25 would be let in Friday.<br />The admissions are part of President Biden’s reversal of the Trump policy officially called Migrant Protection Protocols but generally known as Remain in Mexico. It required migrants seeking asylum, many of them families, to wait in Mexican border cities for their claims to be resolved, rather than in the U.S. as had previously been the case.<br />The waits have been prolonged by the Covid-19 pandemic that closed immigration courts handling their claims.<br />The administration announced last week that, beginning Friday, it would start allowing some migrants in the program to enter the U.S. The government said it is moving slowly because allowing in large numbers of people could pose a public-health risk.</td>

The governor has presented the scandal as simply a debate about the way deaths were categorized, while rejecting the notion that his policies increased mortality. His position will be harder to maintain after Thursday’s release of a new study from New York’s Empire Center for Public Policy.<br />Readers will recall that the Empire Center is the think tank that spent months trying to pry Covid data out of Mr. Cuomo’s government, which offered a series of unbelievable excuses for its refusal to disclose. Finally on Feb. 10—six months after the Empire Center filed a request under the state’s Freedom of Information Law, five months after it sued the government, and one week after a state court ruled that the Cuomo administration had violated the law and ordered it to come clean—Team Cuomo finally started coughing up some of the records.<br />The Empire Center’s new analysis of long-hidden data suggests that  a key Cuomo policy had disastrous results in the spring of 2020. After reviewing the information on deaths in long-term care facilities, Bill Hammond and Ian Kingsbury of the Empire Center report:<br />The study clearly suggests that Cuomo policy cost lives, and not just a few of them. According to the authors:<br />The Empire Center’s findings directly contradict what the Cuomo Health Department was saying last July—even as officials refused to disclose the underlying data that would have allowed the public to evaluate Cuomo claims.</td>

      <td>Move comes as President Biden makes tackling global warming one of four crises he aims to address</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. officially rejoined the Paris climate change agreement on Friday as President Biden puts environmental policy at the center of his agenda and prepares to work with world leaders to cut global greenhouse gas emissions.<br />On his first day in office last month Mr. Biden took an initial step toward rejoining the global accord, which was a signature achievement of former President Barack Obama and from which former President Donald Trumpsubsequently withdrew.<br />Under the agreement’s rules, a country can formally re-enter the pact 30 days after it gives notice to the United Nations. Friday marks the end of that 30-day period.<br />“The work to reduce our emissions has already begun, and we will waste no time in engaging our partners around the world to build our global resilience,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote on Twitter.<br />Mr. Trump argued that the agreement’s terms weren’t fair to the U.S. because other major emitters weren’t doing enough to cut emissions under the pact. Though Mr. Trump repeatedly said during his presidency that the U.S. was no longer a party to the agreement, the withdrawal became effective in early November 2020, near the end of his term, because it took time to formally exit the pact.</td>

In all, 57 people—including parents, college coaches, test proctors and others—have been charged, and more than 40 have pleaded guilty, including the ringleader, William “Rick” Singer, who is awaiting sentencing.<br />Mr. Caplan pleaded to felony conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest-services mail fraud for paying Mr. Singer to have a proctor change answers on his daughter’s ACT score. In addition to the month in prison, a U.S. District Court judge in Boston sentenced him to 250 hours of community service and a $50,000 fine.<br />Felony convictions often result in the loss of a law license, but a New York appellate court on Thursday agreed with an earlier disciplinary decision that a two-year suspension was enough. Retroactive to around the time of his sentencing, Mr. Caplan can practice law again in November.<br />An attorney for Mr. Caplan, 54 years old, said he “is deeply appreciative of the treatment he has received by the court and is committed to making amends for his conduct.”</td>

      <td>After a dispiriting year of living and working through video, women are investing in fashion and accessories that truly shine on-screen. How to make an impact from the waist up.</td>
      <td>IF WE’RE GOING to do this, then let’s do this,” declared Tanya Golesic over Zoom, flashing a wrist stacked with bangles and a kinetic gold cocktail ring. Ms. Golesic, the 49-year-old president of the Americas for shoe empire Jimmy Choo, initially surrendered to casual wear after leaving her New York home to shelter—and videoconference—in place on Long Island last spring. But once June rolled around, she snapped out of her sartorial slump, slipping into blouses and blazers with outsize sleeves and textural sweaters, all eventfully augmented by baubles. “I think people are over being boring…The whole idea of glamour is coming back.” She fantasizes about setting track pants on fire.<br />Over the past year, we’ve learned how to conduct everything from job interviews to divorces via computer screen. The halfhearted leggings-and-collared-shirt thing was fine when we naively thought confinement would last a few weeks. But the novelty of slobbing about in workout wear all day has waned. Now, thanks to some combination of optimism, sweatshirt fatigue and longing for a pre-pandemic world, many women are not only getting dressed for Zoom—they’re getting decked out.<br />“Feeling like you have a reason to look great is empowering,” said Mercedes Posey, a Dallas clinical operations project manager who has logged into video work calls, galas and girls’ nights. Throwing on such exuberant wares as can’t-miss-’em chandelier earrings, bright-pink tops and a pearl-dappled beret gives Ms. Posey, 35, something to look forward to. Her vivacious work outfits have become such a small-screen sensation that her colleagues protest on the rare occasions her camera’s turned off.<br />If you’re ready to elevate your own Zoom wardrobe, designers are conveniently offering plenty of tempting waist-up fodder this season. Miu Miu saw fit to embellish turtlenecks with crystals. Versace’s oceanic prints will pop against any Zoom background; and Alexander McQueen’s puffy sleeves (like those on the tromp l’oeil corset sweater shown above) cut a sumptuous silhouette on the screen. Swarovski’s new creative director Giovanna Engelbert has just unveiled a bevy of supersize crystal jewelry that, even if worn with a plain T-shirt, will inject even the most droning video call with sparkle. Ms. Engelbert, who designed her debut collection in lockdown, admitted that she “went bigger because of Zoom, probably.”<br />Harriet Hawksworth, the editor in chief at e-commerce platform Farfetch, has noticed a rabid appetite for bright colors, punchy prints (like Marine Serre’s signature crescent moons) and statement accessories. Chunky chain necklaces, hoops and headbands, like the red Prada one that inaugural poet Amanda Gorman wore indelibly at the inauguration, have proven popular. Such emphatic accessories “help you stand out from all the other tiny squares,” said Jennifer Behr, a New York designer known for crystal-covered headbands. Her sales have leapt 40% in the last two months compared with the same period last year.</td>

      <td>Staring at themselves on video has made women everywhere reconsider their beauty routines. Here, an expert guide to looking (relatively) flawless on camera.</td>
      <td>WHEN DID our Zoom screens become so cruel? When you spend some days confronting your own face almost continuously, minuscule flaws become magnified. It’s what New York dermatologist Dendy Engelman calls the Zoom effect. “Zoom is making people notice all of their small imperfections,” she explained. “We are used to seeing our faces statically in the mirror, rather than dynamically as we do on video,” added New York plastic surgeon Adam Kolker. Movements and expressions “often demonstrate facial aging more vividly.”<br />In the age of Zoom-induced self-scrutiny, interest in cosmetic procedures has held strong. Most popular, said Dr. Kolker, are “neuromodulators [like Botox] to decrease lines and injectable fillers [like Restylane and Juvederm] to minimize the perception of deeper wrinkles.” For Miami dermatologist Heather Woolery-Lloyd’s patients, Zoom has cast a spotlight on skin-tone and texture issues, which she addresses with chemical peels and microneedling. Dr. Kolker has also seen an uptick in more invasive surgical procedures. “Since people aren’t traveling or dining out, there is more disposable income to ‘treat yourself,’” said Dr. Engelman.<br />Carine Vinett, the New York-based founder of the Best Friend, a product that helps women zip up the back of their dresses solo, has always adhered to a robust skin care routine, but even she’s not immune to Zoom-inspired insecurity. “I’m the face [of my brand]…and my skin was looking dull and red on Zoom, which made me self-conscious,” she said. Her fix: getting Clear + Brilliant laser treatments and subtle filler in her cheeks, and incorporating products with active ingredients (like Shani Darden’s Texture Reform, which has a mild retinoid) into her daily regimen. “My skin looks brighter, and I’m actually wearing less makeup,” she said. Lindsay Holden, 40, the co-founder of Minneapolis-based haircare brand Odele, Zooms all day, between work meetings and her kids’ web schooling. “An hour rarely goes by that I’m not reminded of what I look like via screen,” she said. “It made me feel like I really needed to up my skin game.” She went from casual to religious eye-cream use, introduced a vitamin C serum (like that from Skinceuticals, below) and used her nighttime retinol more regularly (see one from Shani Darden, below). Cynthia Manick, 41, who Zooms as a project manager in Brooklyn by day and a performing poet by night, has amplified her beauty program, too. Her augmented approach includes a spin brush for cleansing; a rose-quartz gua sha for massaging; biweekly masks; and moisturizers (she rotates between Sunday Riley’s Water Cream and Osea’s Essential Hydrating Oil depending on her skin’s needs).<br />While Zoom has led many to intensify their routines, experts caution against overdoing it. “You do not want to overwork your skin, stripping it and harming its barrier,” said Dr. Engelman. Dry skin will put the signs of aging into sharper focus. “Keeping skin hydrated…will make imperfections disappear,” added Dallas and New York esthetician Joanna Czech.<br />The ideal skin care arsenal includes gentle cleanser, antioxidant serum, good moisturizer, mineral sunscreen (even when you’re inside all day) and a mild retinol. To decrease puffiness, Ms. Czech recommends facial self-massage. Strategically placed highlighter can also help. Using a blender brush, New York makeup artist and co-founder of Westman Atelier Gucci Westman sweeps it up the cheekbones and across the lids. “It’s perfect for adding warmth and definition,” she said.</td>

      <td>Injury can bring a country together. But this is a compound fracture to the national psyche.</td>
      <td>At Newsweek in the old days, they called it “the violin.” At Time, where I worked, we spoke of the “mood of the nation.” It referred to an article, leading the magazine’s national news section in certain weeks, that in a sequence of anecdotes, quotes and generalizations would tell Americans what they were feeling and thinking at that particular moment.<br />A stupid idea, I told myself when I sat down to write one of these things: How could anyone presume to describe the “mood” of more than 200 million people? And yet by the time I finished writing the piece, I often found I had changed my mind and decided the conceit had some validity—that it might honestly touch on thoughts and emotions that Americans shared for a moment. You could see the country whole—or glimpse it. It did not seem wrong to generalize as long as you didn’t get carried away. I found this was true even in the thick of the Vietnam War, the period that was the seedbed of the divisions of our own time.<br />Can there be such a thing as national mood in a country as big and diverse as the U.S.? Consider that the country’s moral, emotional and political atmosphere was radically different on Sept. 12, 2001, from what it had been on Sept. 10. You could say the same thing about Nov. 23, 1963, the day after John Kennedy’s assassination, and Dec. 8, 1941, after Pearl Harbor.<br />National mood may crystallize under the pressure of crisis: a sudden clarity. You didn’t need polls to understand it. We feel distinctive national moods in quieter times, too, though in more elusive, contradictory patterns. Sometimes the river is fairly smooth. Sometimes the country goes over Niagara Falls.<br />At worst, one tremendous mood will collide with another. It was no use for Abraham Lincoln to appeal in his first inaugural to the “mystic chords of memory”—to a reverence for the history that Americans had in common. Too late. The country went ahead with the Civil War.</td>

      <td>Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.</td>
      <td>When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won her upset victory against Democratic Rep. Joseph Crowley in 2018, she had the backing of the Democratic Socialists of America. What she lacked was a single endorsement from New York’s powerful unions. Since then, candidates supported by the DSA have scored more wins against union-supported incumbents. As New York heads into an election cycle that will shape the politics of America’s largest city for the next four years, unions and the DSA are on a collision course.<br />New York’s unions are a heterodox group, ranging from public-sector outfits like the United Federation of Teachers and District Council 37, which cherish the rich compensation they’ve won for members over the years, to more conservative trade unions like the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, which benefit when the city’s economy grows. Despite their sometimes divergent interests, these unions have always found enough common cause to become a central force in the city’s Democratic coalition. But they were caught off guard by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s appeal, especially in gentrifying neighborhoods where recently arrived young progressives embraced her antiestablishment campaign.<br />After her election, union leaders tried to play down their support for Mr. Crowley, arguing that they had little choice but to support an incumbent. “You’re constantly making pragmatic decisions about the relationships that you need to have if you’re a union that relies on the government to assist with some of the things that you need for your members,” Bob Master, local political director of the Communications Workers of America, told Jacobin magazine. “Young radicals need to understand this.”<br />But if labor leaders expected young radicals to accept the way things worked, they were naive. Quickly, DSA officials began plotting to infiltrate local unions and overthrow their leadership. In August 2019 Politico New York published a DSA memo outlining a “strategy for militant, democratic, classwide struggles” that included stinging assessments of some unions.<br />About the powerful United Federation of Teachers, DSA said: “Simply put, it is tremendously influential politically, but fails to exercise the full potential of its power. Its strategy rests on electing fairly centrist/conservative Democrats.” The New York Hotel Trades Council, with more than 35,000 members, “seems to have shifted towards accommodation in its relations” with management. A recent contract, the memo said, “attempts to impose a suffocating and prolonged period of employer-friendly labor peace.”</td>

      <td>The exuberant monuments of the French-American sculptor are the focus of a new exhibition at MoMA PS1.</td>
      <td>The artist Niki de Saint Phalle is perhaps best known for the sculptures she called “Nanas”—colorful, outsize women whose exuberant curves defy all notions of restraint or decorum. But for Saint Phalle, those ebullient figures were only a warm-up. “I felt compelled to prove that a woman could work on a monumental scale,” she wrote. She went on to create fanciful, building-sized constructions—women, dragons, monsters, towers—that double as artworks and habitable spaces.<br />“Niki de Saint Phalle: Structures for Life,” a new exhibition opening March 11 at MoMA PS1 in Queens, N.Y., will be the first New York show to survey the artist’s decades-long career, with an emphasis on her monumental projects. The more than 200 works on view include sculptures, maquettes, prints, drawings, books and jewelry—and of course, Nanas. “Clarice Again” (1966-67), standing not quite 7 feet tall, greets visitors in the show’s opening gallery. First appearing in the mid-1960s, “these big, happy women were a political statement” meant to counter what Saint Phalle saw as “regressive or patriarchal thinking,” said the exhibition’s organizer, PS1 curator Ruba Katrib. Despite their winsome charm, Saint Phalle wanted the Nanas “to become almost intimidating figures.”<br />Saint Phalle had a knack for embedding provocative ideas in playful forms. Born in 1930 to a French aristocrat father and French-American mother, she had what might seem a storybook life: a privileged childhood, immediate success as a teenage fashion model, followed by marriage to a childhood friend and early acclaim as an avant-garde artist. But that glossy exterior concealed a history of childhood sexual abuse that led Saint Phalle to a nervous breakdown at 23, when she was confined to an asylum in France. “These are things that she brought into her work constantly,” Ms. Katrib said, “processing them through her art.”<br />At MoMA PS1, the show’s first gallery focuses on Saint Phalle’s monumental projects. They include the “Stravinsky Fountain” (1983) in Paris, created with her longtime companion, the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely (1925-1991), as well as “Golem” (1972), a playground slide in the shape of a monster with three bright red tongues, made for a kid-filled neighborhood in Jerusalem. Commissioned as a child’s playhouse, “Le Dragon de Knokke” (1973-75), built in a seaside town in Belgium, holds a main room, kitchen, bath and second-floor sleeping area, along with a child-sized play area in the tail. In 1987, Keith Haring stayed there while painting a mural in Knokke, leaving behind—with Saint Phalle’s blessing—a frieze-like drawing along the interior stairway and balcony.<br />Roughly half the main gallery at PS1 is devoted to Saint Phalle’s magnum opus, “Tarot Garden,” which fills 14 acres of Tuscan countryside with sculptures and structures based on the 22 picture cards of the tarot deck. Work on the project began in 1979 and ended only with the artist’s death in 2002. The tallest structure in “Tarot Garden” tops out at roughly 50 feet; Saint Phalle herself lived for years in the sphinx-like work known as “The Empress,” which houses a bedroom and bath in one breast and a kitchen in the other.</td>

Beijing has also laid claim to disputed islands in the South and East China seas, staged shows of force against Taiwan, which it considers a breakaway Chinese territory, and moved to crack down on Hong Kong’s political autonomy and civil liberties.<br />The Biden administration has in its first month moved to renew relationships with allies as a way of competing jointly with China, while maintaining the overall tougher U.S. approach taken at the end of former President Donald Trump’s term.</td>

Pittman “has directed that any member of her department whose behavior is not in keeping with the Department’s Rules of Conduct will face appropriate discipline,” said John Stolnis, a spokesman for USCP.<br />Several congressional committees are also probing the security failures during the attack, and a pair of Senate committees will hold a hearing on Tuesday with officials involved in Capitol security. A House committee will hold a hearing next week with the acting Capitol Police chief and acting House Sergeant at Arms.<br />Lawmakers and other Capitol Police officers have questioned why the force was so unprepared for the attack. In a closed-door hearing last month, acting Chief Pittman said that by Jan. 4 the Capitol Police saw that the rally carried “strong potential for violence,” with extremists likely to attend. The force was still quickly overwhelmed.</td>

Also known as “The Champion Single Sculls,” it is the artist’s first major work.<br />Eakins was born in Philadelphia in 1844. His father, Benjamin, was an accomplished calligrapher of official documents and acquainted the youth with the pleasures and practices of drawing. Thomas showed exceptional talent, and was enrolled in 1857 at Central High School, which had a substantial curriculum in art and science.<br />There he expanded his technical skills and had his first exposure to perspective drawing. Following this, he entered the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1862, and took life classes drawing the nude model. All of these pursuits were critical factors in the shaping of his future career.<br />But what may have had the greatest impact on Eakins’s future were the lectures on human anatomy at Jefferson Medical College, which he attended in 1864, just as he was finishing work at the Pennsylvania Academy. He bypassed the Civil War, and at his father’s urging left for further study in Europe in 1866.</td>

      <td>To make real progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, President Biden and Congress will need to break with environmentalist dogmas.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration’s climate efforts seemingly began with a bang. Within days of his inauguration, President Biden announced a slew of climate-related executive orders, including plans to rejoin the Paris Agreement, cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and suspend new oil and gas leasing on public lands. Some of these actions will have a tangible impact. But much of what Mr. Biden announced was performative, offering succor to his environmental supporters but not much else. In truth, his ability to move the needle on U.S. emissions through executive action is extremely limited.<br />Consider that Obama-era regulations on power plant emissions, which President Biden may try to promulgate again, didn’t actually require significantly lower emissions than what will likely happen anyway, as natural gas and renewable energy continue to displace coal-generated electricity. He may, similarly, attempt to reinstate automobile fuel efficiency standards that President Trump dismantled. But with the nation’s auto makers already moving quickly to electric vehicles, the emissions benefits to be gained from another round of trench warfare over efficiency requirements for internal combustion vehicles are likely to be underwhelming.<br />Mr. Biden’s options are limited for other reasons on Capitol Hill. Notwithstanding the bold talk from Democrats and environmentalists, neither Congress nor the public appear to have much stomach for costly regulatory actions. Democrats simply do not have the votes to pass carbon caps, carbon taxes or a Green New Deal. And even were they able to do so, the history of such policies is not promising. Neither carbon trading systems nor carbon taxes, for instance, has done much to deeply cut emissions anywhere in the world.<br />If there is good news for President Biden, it is that U.S. emissions have been falling for the last decade, thanks in large part to years of federal investment in clean technology, from research and development to loan guarantees to tax credits. Today, wind, solar, battery and electric vehicle technologies are increasingly competitive in many parts of the country without ongoing subsidies or mandates. These policies have reliably been supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. So there is a path for Mr. Biden to accelerate progress on cutting emissions, one that depends less on defeating climate-skeptical Republicans in Congress and more on doubling down on the things that are working already: technology, infrastructure, economic productivity and partnerships with the private sector to accelerate innovation.<br />That path may sound easier. But it brings its own challenges, as it will likely require Mr. Biden to confront a number of longstanding environmental shibboleths that stand in the way of deeply cutting U.S. emissions.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Five years after his Supreme Court nomination died in a political standoff, Merrick Garland is expected to get a bipartisan welcome during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday as President Biden’s choice for attorney general.<br />The federal judge and former prosecutor is likely to face questions about the Justice Department’s handling of a rise in extremist violence such as the  attack by Donald Trump supporters on the U.S. Capitol and, when Republicans have their turn, the destruction in Portland, Ore., and Seattle that followed Black Lives Matter protests last summer.<br />If confirmed, Judge Garland, a 1997 Clinton appointee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, would also oversee several politically sensitive investigations begun under the previous administration, including a criminal tax investigation into President Biden’s son, Hunter, and a special-counsel probe examining the origins of the FBI’s 2016 Russia investigation.<br />Mr. Biden has said he would defer to his attorney general on how to handle those inquiries, as well as on any decisions the department makes about whether to prosecute former President Donald Trump for offenses such as his alleged incitement of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by rioters trying to block confirmation of Mr. Biden’s win last November. Mr. Trump’s lawyers and allies have denied he incited the riot, and the former president was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial.<br />Judge Garland would supervise, as well, the historic antitrust case against  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google—the biggest such lawsuit in decades—filed by the department last fall, alleging the tech giant used anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly position in search and search advertising. Google denies the allegations.</td>

      <td>Tragedy marked the writer’s early life, but his career has been a celebration of the gifts of intellect and freedom.</td>
      <td>Simon Gray once marveled at the manifold successes of his fellow-playwright Tom Stoppard. “It is actually one of Tom’s achievements that one envies him nothing, except possibly his looks, his talents, his money and his luck. To be so enviable without being envied is pretty enviable, when you think about it.” Mr. Stoppard, now aged 83, has never taken that luck for granted. He’s had a long string of West End, Broadway and Fringe hits, four Tony Awards, an Oscar, several Oliviers, the Order of Merit and countless other honors; he is widely considered Britain’s greatest living playwright. But this triumphant tale had its origins in tragedy and dislocation, as we find in “Tom Stoppard: A Life,” by the empathetic, meticulous biographer Hermione Lee (author of previous lives of Virginia Woolf, Edith Wharton and Penelope Fitzgerald).<br />Mr. Stoppard was born in 1937 as Tomáš Sträussler in Zlín, Czechoslovakia, where his father Eugen worked as a doctor in a hospital run by the Bata shoe company, the gigantic corporation for which Zlín was the company town. When the Nazis entered the country in 1939 the hospital director arranged foreign visas for the Jewish doctors, including Eugen Sträussler. So Eugen, Marta and their two small boys, Petr and Tomáš, decamped to Singapore, where Eugen continued his work as a Bata physician.<br />This refuge lasted only two years, until the Japanese invasion. Marta and the boys got out safely but Eugen was killed when his ship was attacked. The remaining three Sträusslers fetched up in India, where they stayed four years, much of the time in Darjeeling where Marta worked in a Bata shop. Here Tomáš, aged 4, attended a boarding school at a house named Arcadia (a word that would re-emerge as the title of perhaps his best-loved play) and learned English. In 1945 Marta married a British Army officer, Maj. Kenneth Stoppard, who brought his bride and her sons back to England. They were to become, to all appearances, a wholly British family; the boys were renamed Peter and Tom Stoppard, the mother Bobby.<br />Ken Stoppard, the boys later realized, was anti-Semitic and xenophobic, and so Bobby did her best to bury her past—not so much in submission as in an effort to give her sons everything good that life might offer them. She ardently believed in the oft-mocked formulation of Cecil Rhodes, that “to be born English was to win first prize in the lottery of life”—a sentiment Tom would come to agree with. Bobby and her sons had not been born English but wished to become so, and to this end she concealed from the boys their Jewish background and the fact that all four of their grandparents and three of their aunts had died in the Holocaust, keeping her own trauma to herself. And Tom flourished in his new life. He was sent to an idyllically rural prep school. “At the age of eight,” he says, “I fell in love with England almost at first glance, never considering that the England I loved was, in the first place, only a corner of Derbyshire, and, in the second place, perishable.” Ken taught him “to fish, to love the countryside, to speak properly, to respect the Monarchy.” He played good cricket and was a boy scout.<br />The young Stoppard appears to have been too restless for academic success; his teachers noted a lack of “singlemindedness.” He left school at 17, eschewing higher education to work as a journalist in Bristol, where he landed a job on the Western Daily Press. It turned out to be a good move: Bristol’s cultural scene, in the 1950s, was animated, and Ms. Lee’s evocation of it provides us with a lovely piece of social history. With a journalist’s access, Mr. Stoppard discovered new worlds: “law courts, local government, theatre backstage, boxing matches, crime scenes, in fact ‘all of human life’ as the News of the World used to say.”</td>

      <td>Setting out to understand Russia from the outside, an author journeys through the cultures at its margins.</td>
      <td>In the summer of 1648, we learn a few pages into Erika Fatland’s “The Border,” a Cossack named Semyon Dezhnev embarked on an eastward mission to inform the fur-trapping nomads of the Siberian steppe that they were, in fact, subjects of the Russian czar, and to demand taxes (usually furs) accordingly. A skilled diplomat, effective in a job that was equal parts revenue collection and colonization, Dezhnev headed further and further east until, at last, he hit the then-unmapped strait that separates Russia from North America. Within a generation, though, his journey was forgotten, and in 1728 the strait was named after a later “discoverer,” the Danish cartographer Vitus Bering. Today, the larger of the strait’s two islands, Big Diomede, is considered to belong to Russia; the smaller, to Alaska. They are divided by a sound about 3 miles across, and the International Date Line runs down the middle. “In winter,” Ms. Fatland tells us, “when the sound is frozen, it is in theory possible, though of course strictly forbidden, to walk from the U.S.A. to Russia, from yesterday to tomorrow.”<br />There are stories like this aplenty in “The Border” (or, to use its full title, “The Border—A Journey Around Russia: Through North Korea, China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Norway, and the Northeast Passage”). Officially, the book is a travelogue-cum-cultural history, tracing the author’s journey across the 14 countries bordering the world’s largest country. (Of them, only the author’s native Norway was never occupied by Russia.) In practice, however, the book is a hauntingly lyrical meditation to the contingencies of history, the sheer arbitrariness of dividing lines and border posts, of namesakes forgotten and remembered, of successful and unsuccessful wars. Ms. Fatland sets out, she tells us (via Kari Dickson’s archly smooth, British-inflected translation), “to understand a country and its people from the outside, from the perspective of its neighbours,” to identify a quintessential “Russianness” through an investigation of the often-liminal spaces of its periphery.<br />The question, of course, has a political valence. The Russian self-imagination—as a “world in its own right,” one “neither European nor Asian, nor anything in between”—is at the heart not just of centuries of colonial expansion but also of the current geopolitical order. The Putin-era revival of the age-old idea of Moscow as the “third Rome”—as both the religious and imperial heart of modern Christianity, unsullied by such suspicious Western exports as liberal democracy and homosexuality—is inextricable from the wider narrative of Russian exceptionalism, used to justify everything from crackdowns on LGBTQ “propaganda” to political intervention in Crimea.<br />What Ms. Fatland succeeds in doing, to the book’s credit, is both greater in scale and more intimate than her stated aim. Through a series of slickly told, vignette-style chapters, moving from the uncanny valley of North Korean package tours to drunken revelry in the Georgian mountains, Ms. Fatland offers less an account of Russianness than of its subversion: a polyphonic vision of often-arbitrary identities, histories and voices. The idea that we can speak meaningfully about capital-h History comes across, in Ms. Fatland’s wry telling, as faintly absurd: Her interest is less in grand narratives than in, for example, a Kazakh woman’s decision to put German instant coffee into a Russian coffee tin, or the domestic dramas—over stolen household goods—that tear apart the elderly remaining residents of Pripyat, site of the Chernobyl disaster. The closest we get to an image of Russianness, as a national abstract, is “Russian Style Town,” an amusement park in Harbin, China, complete with scattered geese, bored-looking folk dancers, a vodka shop, and a concession selling Putin matryoshka dolls. There Ms. Fatland meets an elderly Russian woman who, unable to survive on her pension back home, makes a living as “local color”: Wearing full babushka garb, she poses for photos with tourists, for tips.<br />“The Border,” then, is less about monistic identity than its impossibility. The state-imagined Russia gives way to the diverse panoply of human beings who exist in dialogue with it, each with his own distinct and richly rendered understanding of his place in the world. It’s about Oleg and Victor, Russians who, while crowing about Russia’s superiority to other nations, snort that St. Petersburg and Moscow aren’t really Russian (too European), but neither is the Caucasus (“definitely not”). It’s about Aragalan, an ethnically Tuvan reindeer herder in Mongolia, who tells Ms. Fatland: “My wife is Mongolian, my children are Mongolian. The only thing that distinguishes me from other Mongolians is that I live in a lavvu and herd reindeer. And I don’t speak Mongolian very well.” If there is a common factor to experience, it is a shared sense of the arbitrariness of history: that any border could easily be moved, that any monument could easily be named for someone else.</td>

      <td>A writer goes in search of her forebears, but finds ‘too much past’ to tell the story straight.</td>
      <td>The Moscow-born writer Maria Stepanova reflects that she has been working on her book “In Memory of Memory” (New Directions, 432 pages, $19.95) since she was 10 years old, when she made the first abortive attempts to chronicle the story of her ancestors. As part of this lifelong obsession she has surrounded herself with their handed-down diaries, photographs and belongings and committed to sifting their contents for revelatory discoveries. Yet the work has always been coupled with a tinge of embarrassment. Despite being Russian Jews during a century of extreme tumult, her ancestors seem to have led resolutely ordinary lives, “well beyond the reach of the textbooks and their footnotes, in a place where all we can see is swirly-patterned wallpaper and an ugly old yellow butter dish, which survived its owner and the old world, and even the twentieth century.”<br />The hybrid book that Ms. Stepanova has finally produced presents gleanings from her family archives alongside the labyrinthine narrative of her “search for the past,” which she concedes is incomplete and in many ways unsuccessful. And amidst the personal artifacts are essay-like meditations on the tensions that inhere within any act of remembrance. The result is a rich, digressive, deeply introspective work that reminded me of James Agee’s “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men” in its tortured eloquence and unflinching self-scrutiny.<br />“There is too much past, and everyone knows it,” she writes at a moment of sharpened despair. The surplus means that memories are necessarily invidious and sorted into two sets, “the interesting and the less interesting,” those “fit for retelling and those . . . only fit for oblivion.” A fanatical, itemizing approach to history can help overcome prejudice, but even the most straightforward documentary material becomes distorted across time. In one searching chapter, Ms. Stepanova explores her love and distrust of photographs, which she thinks bring about “euphoric amnesia,” stimulating emotions that bear no relation to what the pictures originally signified.<br />A dialectic emerges in these omnivorous inquiries into artists and ideas. For every W.G. Sebald, whose novels are filled with painstaking historical inventories, there is an Osip Mandelstam, who believed that memory is “inimical,” an obstacle to experiencing the present. In Judaism, Ms. Stepanova writes, remembrance is a sacred duty; yet the word “dybbuk,” for a malign spirit in Jewish folklore, means “clinging to” and suggests the monstrous effect of being haunted by the past.<br />You can sense the decades of contemplation Ms. Stepanova has dedicated to these questions in the sparkle and density of her prose, which Sasha Dugdale has carried into English so naturally that it’s possible to forget you are reading a translation. This is an erudite, challenging book, but also fundamentally a humble one, as it recognizes that a force works on even the most cherished family possessions that no amount of devotion can gainsay. “Objects falling out of currency slowly lose their defining qualities and turn a new nonhuman face toward us,” Ms. Stepanova writes. “They return to the materials from whence they came, wax, paint, and clay. The past rewilds itself, oblivion springs up out of it like a forest.”</td>

      <td>For investors, that ‘gut feeling’ can be more powerful than they realize. Here’s how to listen to your gut without being ruled by it</td>
      <td>If only financial markets came with traffic signals: indisputable indicators of when it is safe to keep going, when you need to slow down, when you must stop. Imagine how much easier investing would be if you could rely on such green, yellow or red lights.<br />Unfortunately, these unambiguous signals don’t exist. Investors fill much of the absence with anecdotes and gut feelings, which can be more powerful than you realize. Such soft indicators can help you make hard decisions, but only if you rely on them in the right ways.<br />Consider the anecdotal feel of today’s markets.<br />Bitcoin’s price rose above $50,000 this week. Dogecoin, a digital currency intended as a joke, is up more than 1,000% in 2021. Margin debt, borrowed money that brokerage customers use to juice their trading, is up 42% from a year ago, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. For the week ending Feb. 12, bullish options bets by small traders ran at a near-record 16 times the average for the past two decades, calculates Jason Goepfert of Sundial Capital Research, a Minneapolis firm that tracks market sentiment.<br />On the other hand, the Federal Reserve expects to keep firehosing money into the economy and to hold interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future. That pushes the return on safe assets so low that they feel worthless to hold, shoving investors into riskier choices. Vaccines are reaching millions of people, and new coronavirus cases are falling fast, fueling hopes for a quicker and stronger economic recovery.</td>

      <td>In a booming oil town during the tumult of revolution and after, memories of beauty and suffering.</td>
      <td>When Umm El-Banu Assadullayeva, later called Banine, was just 12 years old, she became a multimillionaire. But “only for a few days,” she wryly recalls, “for I was soon woken at dawn by ‘The Internationale’ sung in the street.” The year was 1917 and the Red Army had arrived in Baku, Azerbaijan, the oil-rich Caucasus region where Banine’s family had become immensely wealthy (her grandfather bequeathed her those millions) and where intrusions—by the Russians, the Turks, the British, the Russians again—were as common as bloodbaths. In the year of Banine’s birth, for example, she notes that “it was the better-organized Armenians who were exterminating the Azerbaijanis in revenge for past massacres, while the Azerbaijanis made the best of it by storing up grounds for future slaughter.” And throughout childhood, she and her friends mimicked the mayhem. “On holidays we played at massacring Armenians,” the author recalls of summers by the sea, “a game we loved above all others. Heady with racist passion, we would sacrifice Tamara”—a timid companion—“on the altar of our ancestral hatred.”<br />The youngest of four daughters, Banine was born during the pogroms of 1905, and her mother, having fled the killings, died shortly afterward. Her father was later imprisoned under the Bolshevik regime, and in order to secure his subsequent passage to Europe, Banine, at age 15, married a man of influence whom she detested. These are just some of the tribulations running through “Days in the Caucasus,” a memoir, first published in 1945 and now keenly translated from the French by Anne Thompson-Ahmadova, which spans the tumultuous period from the author’s birth to 1924. Reflecting an era of bloodshed and terror, it should be a grim read. Instead, however, this account is an effervescent and irreverent feat of recollection and imagination—epic in sweep yet intimate in tone—that introduces the reader to an exotic, antique world and to characters so vividly drawn that their raucous voices seem to echo long after they have vanished from sight.<br />“We all know families that are poor but ‘respectable,’ ” the memoir begins. “Mine, in contrast, was extremely rich but not ‘respectable’ at all.” Playfully mirroring Tolstoy, Banine could be ushering us into a capacious 19th-century novel. And in a way she is. For what follows is a captivating drama of family, money, marriage and disaster that unfolds with deceptive ease and irresistible charm, thanks to the agility of a narrator who is both innocent girl and ironic observer. Recalling her German governess, for example, Banine writes: “She hoped to see us turn into Gretchens with delicate figures and easy sighs. But our forebears were keeping watch. Under their guidance, our hips fleshed out, our noses grew longer, our breasts swelled . . . and down, soft at first but quietly turning into thick hair, covered us in dark shadow.”<br />Pale governesses, pianos, culture: in the prewar years all emanated from Germany. Banine’s father even sported a Kaiser Wilhelm moustache (that monarch having endeared himself as a “protector of Islam and the Turks”). But the arrival from Moscow in 1915 of a refined young stepmother introduced Banine and her sisters to more varied European tastes. An English and a French governess deposed loyal Fräulein Anna while the works of Shakespeare and Maupassant supplanted Teutonic “sweet songs for blond children.” Banine’s wider world, enriched by oil fortunes, was already lively and relatively enlightened. (The first secular school for Muslim girls opened in Baku in 1901; the first opera in the Muslim world was performed there in 1908; newspapers thrived.) And the region’s enduring Russian presence, at first imperial then revolutionary, also influenced the girl’s consciousness, not to mention breaking her teenage heart when she fell in love with an ardent Bolshevik commissar. “To live is to be intense, passionate,” Andrey, her moody “prince” declares as he proposes elopement. “We will burn brightly together.” But Andrey runs away with Banine’s scandalous cousin instead, leaving our desolate heroine to marry the politically connected suitor who bears “a striking resemblance to an earthworm.”<br />Weightier events are recounted in a wonderfully dry tone reminiscent at times of Chekhov’s letters or of those sublimely droll novels of Eastern adventure such as Rose Macaulay’s “The Towers of Trebizond” (1956). Banine observes that during World War I “the Turks restored calm in Baku by hanging some poor wretch almost every day.” Peace, on the other hand, brings “talk of an independent Azerbaijan, Armenia, Karelia, Kazakhstan, and I don’t know what else: Independent, Autonomous, Proud, Free and Happy. Epithets accompanied by Republics and Republics combined with epithets rained down on the astonished peoples.”</td>

      <td>Thrift is in a bear market as even the riskiest borrowers rush to issue new debt. That world may not last forever.</td>
      <td>When money is readily available and almost free, why bother saving for a rainy day?<br />For corporations, the question is worth asking at a time when dollars might as well be falling from the sky. The average rate on so-called “high yield” bonds recently fell below 4% to a record low. In the late 1990s, even corporate borrowers with the best reputations paid average interest rates on the order of 7%. There is so much money looking for a place to go that companies are being contacted by investors asking if they would like to issue bonds rated below investment grade rather than the other way around.<br />It is a seller’s market for all manner of risk. While the 10 year U.S. Treasury Note yield has been edging higher since the summer, interest rates have mostly been in decline for decades. Policy makers at the Federal Reserve and other major central banks have indicated that major changes are unlikely anytime soon. Government rescue of private enterprises facing insolvency, once an unthinkable intervention, has become somewhat commonplace. As the Clovers once sang, though not about monetary policy, “your cash ain’t nothin but trash.”<br />The sentiment isn’t quite universal, though.<br />“We take a lot of pride in the Triple-A credit rating, and we see it as a potential competitive differentiator,” says Joseph Wolk, chief financial officer at  Johnson & Johnson ,  which is one of only two U.S. firms remaining with that sterling designation. Prudence helped the company, founded in 1886, survive two world wars, the Great Depression and other calamities.</td>

      <td>Selected by Selina Hastings, the author, most recently, of ‘Sybille Bedford: A Life.’</td>
      <td>By Diana Souhami (1998)<br />1. One of the most famous trials in London during the interwar years involved the writer Radclyffe Hall, who in 1928 shocked conventional society with the lesbian theme of her novel “The Well of Loneliness.” Viciously attacked by the editor of the Sunday Express—“I would rather give . . . [a child] a phial of prussic acid than this novel”—the work was eventually judged obscene and all copies of the book ordered to be destroyed. Devastating as this was, the case gave Hall, or “John,” as she was known among her friends, a celebrity she relished. Wealthy, arrogant and notoriously short-tempered, Hall dressed as a man, in a suit and tie, with her hair cropped short, cigar usually in hand. Diana Souhami describes with perspicacity and wit the life Hall led with her devoted lover, Una Troubridge. Ensconced in luxury in London, with a large staff and a chauffeur-driven Daimler, the two holidayed across Europe. They remained together nearly 30 years, despite Hall’s final affair with a young Russian woman, deeply resented by Una, who had to wait for Hall’s death before she could take her revenge.<br />By Gertrude Stein (1933)<br />2. It was in September 1907 that two expatriate Americans, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, met in Paris, where they remained, living happily together for nearly 40 years. While Stein, clever, vigorous and eccentric, became highly regarded as a writer, running a salon popular among the city’s avant-garde, Toklas remained shyly in the background, working devotedly as Stein’s lover, secretary, editor and cook. Stein’s account of this period, teasingly presented as though written by Toklas, is a mischievous and highly perceptive impression of life in the artistic world of the Left Bank. Among the many characters in Stein’s inner circle was Picasso, in appearance like “a good-looking bootblack,” as well as Braque, Matisse, Hemingway and T.S. Eliot. “The geniuses came and talked to Gertrude Stein and the wives sat with me,” records the fictional narrator. During World War I, the two women undertook voluntary work with American forces, which they enjoyed: “Gertrude Stein always said the war was always so much better than just going to America.” Although Toklas is presented as modest and self-effacing, Stein’s wicked wit is never far from the surface, one of the reasons this book would make her name.<br />By Sybille Bedford (1968)</td>

      <td>The new biotechnology called CRISPR offers the prospect of defeating lethal viruses and curing genetic diseases, even as it raises serious moral questions</td>
      <td>In the spring of 2014, Jennifer Doudna had a nightmare.<br />The Berkeley biochemist had helped to invent a powerful new technology that made it possible to edit the human genome—an achievement that made her the recipient of a Nobel Prize in 2020. The innovation was based on a trick that bacteria have used for more than a billion years to fight off viruses, a talent very relevant to us humans these days. In their DNA, bacteria develop clustered, repeated sequences (what scientists call CRISPRs) that can recognize and then chop up viruses that attack them. Dr. Doudna and others adapted the system to create a tool that can edit DNA—opening up the potential for curing genetic diseases, creating healthier babies, inventing new vaccines, and helping humans to fight their own wars against viruses.<br />But Dr. Doudna’s nightmare didn’t concern these happy prospects. In it, she was asked to meet someone who wanted to learn about CRISPR. When she entered the room for the meeting, she recoiled: Sitting in front of her was Adolf Hitler with the face of a pig. “I want to understand the uses and implications of this amazing technology you’ve developed,” he said.<br />Four years later, He Jiankui, a young Chinese scientist who had attended some of Dr. Doudna’s conferences, used CRISPR to create the world’s first designer babies: twin girls whose DNA had been edited when they were embryos to remove a gene that produces a receptor for the virus that causes AIDS. There was an immediate outburst of awe, and then shock. Arms flailed, committees convened. After more than three billion years of the evolution of life on this planet, one species (us) had developed the talent and the temerity to seize control of its own genetic future. We seemed to have crossed the threshold into a whole new age, perhaps a brave new world, summoning up images of Adam and Eve biting into the apple or Prometheus snatching fire from the gods.<br />Our newfound ability to edit our own genes raises fascinating—and troubling—questions. Should we alter our species to make humanity less susceptible to deadly viruses? That seems like a wonderful boon, especially amid the pandemic. And what about trying to get rid of deafness or blindness? Or being short? Or depressed? And if such remedies are possible and safe, why not go farther and allow parents to enhance their children, giving them higher IQs, stronger muscles, greater height, and a preferred hue of skin and hair?</td>

Written by María García Esperón, translated by David Bowles, and illustrated with arresting blue, black and white digital pictures by Amanda Mijangos, the stories have a dual quality of immediacy and remoteness: Moments of sharp clarity seem to wink amid great stirring clouds of hidden meaning.<br />In “Golden King,” for instance, a story from the pre-Columbian Muisca civilization, a king demands that a wizard retrieve his drowned wife and son, alive, from a fathomless lake. Closing his eyes, the wizard sees the beautiful woman sitting on an emerald throne, while the prince in her lap plays with a golden disc. “Your wife and your son are now gods beneath the waters,” the wizard says. “As such they ask you to institute a ritual: offerings of gold and emeralds.” But there is yet greater sacrifice: “You must offer yourself.” The story ends with the king daubing himself in resin and gold dust, raising his arms to the sky “like a resplendent human bird” and plunging to a willing death. Evocative and stirring, the stories in “The Sea-Ringed World” are mesmerizing to read aloud, though parents will want to brush up on their pronunciations before embarking. Names such as Ix Chebel Yax and Kookyangwso’wuuti are easier to say on the fly when you’ve checked the glossary first.<br />From modern-day Japan come seven enchanting vignettes involving a young dreamer in “Sato the Rabbit” (Enchanted Lion, 59 pages, $17.95), by Yuki Ainoya. Our hero in this compact little picture book (translated by Michael Blaskowsky) is a boy who wears a rabbit costume and sees all sorts of wonderful possibilities in the world. While watering the garden, he imagines—as we see in a beguiling painting—that a distant pond is “blowing water into the hose as hard as it can.” Noticing the sunset reflected in a puddle, Sato the Rabbit lifts up its rosy surface, like a luminous manhole cover, and finds himself transported to the sky. In another story, Sato cracks walnuts and discovers tiny loaves of bread and a pot of hot coffee inside one set of shells, a miniature bed and steaming bath inside another. The soft lines and delectable colors of Ms. Ainoya’s pictures, and their charming details (the walnut bath has a loofah and a little towel rack), will have 4- to 8-year-olds wishing they could climb into Sato’s world. Their parents may wish it, too.<br />Most of us will never get to see the northern or southern lights in person. These solar phenomena produce vast colored curtains in the night sky, but they’re viewable only from the top and bottom of the world. So the pleasures of “Seeking an Aurora” (Blue Dot, 32 pages, $17.95) are likely to be vicarious for most readers ages 3-7. Written by Elizabeth Pulford and illustrated by Anne Bannock, both New Zealanders, this quietly thrilling picture book chronicles the late-night excursion of a father and child. Having tiptoed through the house to avoid waking the rest of the family, the pair steps into frosty rural darkness: “Outside everything was still. Even the dogs were quiet, and the cows looked like prehistoric creatures, their noses streaming smoke.”</td>
