      <td>Deal would follow multibillion-dollar debt issuance in 2014 and 2017</td>
      <td>Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  plans to sell billions of dollars of bonds, in what will be a test of investor appetite after the e-commerce giant’s recent run-ins with Chinese authorities.<br />In a brief statement late Tuesday, Alibaba said it planned to issue dollar debt, including some bonds to fund sustainability-related projects, subject to market conditions. It said the deal’s total size hadn’t been fixed, nor had the bonds’ maturities, interest rates or other terms.<br />The deal could total up to $5 billion and include bonds with maturities as long as 40 years, according to a notice sent to investors by one of the banks handling the sale. The message was sent on Wednesday morning Hong Kong time and was seen by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Alibaba shares have swung sharply in recent months, after a speech in October by founder Jack Ma prompted Chinese President Xi Jinping to call off the blockbuster listing of Ant Group Co., the company’s financial-technology affiliate.<br />In December, Chinese authorities launched an antitrust probe into Alibaba and fined it and rivals for product pricing that misled consumers. Mr. Ma has largely vanished from public life, but resurfaced briefly in January in a video appearance, helping boost Alibaba’s stock.</td>

      <td>After the pandemic, budget carriers are expected to grow in more congested markets while keeping costs low. Doing both has proven tricky before.</td>
      <td>For vaccine optimists, there may be no clearer way to bet on the recovery than investing in budget airlines. But much depends on whether these low-cost carriers can remain, well, low cost.<br />This week, Dublin-based  Ryanair  reported fourth-quarter earnings well short of analyst expectations. Last week,  Southwest Airlines  managed to surpass forecasts but issued gloomy guidance for the current quarter. It is still up in the air whether leisure travel can reopen in time for the high-summer season.<br />But investors know that, sooner or later, the exit from the pandemic will play in favor of budget airlines and against their full-service competitors. Short-haul traffic will bounce back before international flights, and corporate travelers will be fewer and more price-conscious.<br />The rub is that the market has already priced a lot of this in: On average, the shares of low-cost carriers are back roughly to where they were a year ago, even though their revenues are only forecast to catch up with pre-pandemic trends around 2025. To meet expectations amid heavy discounting, they will need to come out of the Covid crisis making a lot more money with fewer sales.<br />Which is to say, with structurally lower costs. This is their challenge.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Treasury Department on Wednesday announced few changes to its regular debt issuance schedule for the current quarter, while emphasizing the government continues to face uncertain and sizable borrowing needs due to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The agency intends to maintain the size of nominal coupon auction sizes this quarter, after ramping up auction sizes last year to accommodate a surge in government spending to combat the pandemic and cushion the U.S. economy.<br />“Treasury believes that these changes have created sufficient capacity to address near-term projected borrowing needs,” said Brian Smith, the Treasury’s deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, in a statement on the agency’s quarterly borrowing needs.<br />The Treasury also will continue to gradually increase auction sizes for Treasury inflation-protected securities, as announced in November, boosting the size of those auctions by $10 billion to $20 billion over the 2021 calendar year.<br />The borrowing plans are consistent with expectations from the vast majority of primary dealers and recommendations from a Treasury borrowing advisory committee, a senior Treasury official said Wednesday morning. The plans also preserve flexibility for Treasury, in light of potential uncertainty about government spending and the possibility for another economic relief package in Congress, the official said.</td>

Yields fall when bond prices rise. Italy’s stock market also rallied, with the FTSE MIB benchmark up 2.6%.<br />Italy’s coalition government collapsed in January over arguments about how to spend European Union funding meant to spur the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Draghi, who was credited as ECB chief with saving the eurozone from its political and financial crisis in 2012, is seen by investors as a safe, technocratic leader capable of helping Italy out of its worst recession since World War II.<br />The market reaction suggests investors think Mr. Draghi can govern for a while and enact reforms, said Sebastien Galy, a macro strategist at  Nordea Asset Management .  But there are no guarantees.<br />“Should he fail to form a government, a snap election would be called, and the odds are still moderate that this will happen given the fractious nature of Italian politics,” Mr. Galy said.</td>

Tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.6% after Alphabet and  Amazon.com  reported strong sales growth late Tuesday.<br />Stock markets have rallied this week, shaking off concerns about stretched valuations, a sharp run-up in prices for a handful of stocks and silver, a weak economic backdrop and the threat of new coronavirus variants. Investors have focused instead on better-than-expected corporate results and bets that President Biden will deliver more fiscal spending in coming weeks.<br />“The last two days have seen the return of the feeling that we still have monetary stimulus in the background and the prospect of an additional stimulus package to come,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Advisors. “The path ahead isn’t a smooth one, but we think it is an upward one.”<br />Shares in Alphabet climbed over 7% in premarket trading after the parent of Google said late Tuesday that it had booked record revenue in the fourth quarter.</td>

Mr. Reig said the expansion of Revel’s business into electric-vehicle charging fits the company’s mission of expanding green technology.<br />Limited charging availability is seen as an impediment to electric-vehicle growth, especially in densely populated New York where many people don’t live in a home with access to electricity close to where they park their vehicle.</td>

      <td>Robinhood Markets Inc. will advertise during the Super Bowl, as the online brokerage seeks to repair its image in the wake of the  GameStop Corp.  stock-trading saga.<br />Robinhood faced a backlash from customers and some lawmakers after it restricted trading on certain highflying stocks last week. Critics said the move ran counter to the brand’s mission of democratizing investing. Robinhood said the restrictions were put in place so it could meet the obligations of a clearinghouse that finalizes trades.<br />On Sunday, the company is expected to air a 30-second commercial during Super Bowl LV with the message that anyone can invest. The ad features a montage of ordinary people going about their lives—a young man going for a jog, a dad taking care of his infant, a woman dying her hair.<br />“We make short-term investments, long-term investments, we diversify our interests, realize our gains and losses, and try to keep the big picture in mind,” the narrator in the ad says. “You don’t need to become an investor, you were born one.”<br />Robinhood purchased the Super Bowl ad time, which has been selling for roughly $5.5 million for 30 seconds, in December. Amid the recent controversy, executives at the Silicon Valley startup discussed pulling out of the big game or creating a new ad, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company decided to move ahead with the commercial after seeing a surge in interest in the service—even with the negative publicity—the person said.</td>

The litigation is a particularly contentious example of the legal pushback startups face from legacy companies—increasingly the norm over the past decade for disruptive new businesses from Uber to  Airbnb ,  experts said.<br />Careismatic Brands, a leader in medical apparel with brands of scrubs like Cherokee and Dickies, has pursued litigation against Figs since 2019, saying the smaller company has misled health-care workers with boasts about how its products help keep them safe.<br />Figs’s advertising and social-media presence look more like those of a fashion brand than a medical-apparel maker, including sometimes irreverent videos and images of people wearing Figs while getting out of helicopters, skiing and skateboarding. Its online-sales model, aimed at selling directly to medical professionals, contrasts with Careismatic’s heavy reliance on bricks-and-mortar retailers.<br />Careismatic, previously known as Strategic Partners Inc., has asked a federal judge in Riverside, Calif., to issue an injunction requiring Figs to publicly renounce some marketing claims, including that its scrubs kill bacteria and infection on contact, repel liquids and reduce hospital-acquired infections by 66%.</td>

      <td>Former ECB president will begin talks with Italy’s parties in a nation skeptical of technocrats but in need of new direction</td>
      <td>ROME—Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, was formally tasked by Italy’s president on Wednesday with forming a government of national unity to steer the country out of its political, economic and health crises.<br />Italy is turning to Mr. Draghi, one of Europe’s most respected public officials, at a time when it needs to shore up its credibility within the European Union, which last year promised to help finance Italy’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic but this month has looked askance at Rome, where the  government collapsed amid squabbles over how to spend the EU money, as well as personal animosities between politicians.<br />Financial markets welcomed the nomination of Mr. Draghi. Milan’s main stock-market index gained 2% Wednesday morning. The risk premium on Italian government bonds compared with supersafe German bonds declined to the lowest level for nearly five years.<br />Mr. Draghi, as ECB president, is widely credited with defusing the eurozone’s sovereign-debt crisis in 2012 by promising to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro. His supporters hope Mr. Draghi can intervene with similar effectiveness in Italy’s economic policies. The country’s chronically weak growth for more than two decades is seen by many economists as the greatest threat to the euro’s long-term viability.<br />First, however, Mr. Draghi has to persuade a majority of lawmakers in a fragmented Parliament to support him. So far, only centrist parties have come out publicly in support, despite President Sergio Mattarella’s appeal for unity across partisan divides. To become prime minister, Mr. Draghi will need the support of the populist 5 Star Movement or the nationalist League. Both parties have in the past rejected the idea of governments led by economists and technocrats such as Mr. Draghi.</td>

      <td>Sony, like most gaming companies, has done exceptionally well this year. But it is also positioning itself cannily for the post-pandemic world.</td>
      <td>Gamers already snap up  Sony ’s  offerings, as the company’s blockbuster December quarter just demonstrated again. The movies and music business will soon be feeling its deepening influence too.<br />The Japanese electronics and entertainment giant said its operating profit for the quarter ended December rose 20% from a year earlier, driven by stay-at-home demand for its games. Revenue at its gaming division jumped 40% year-over-year—its best quarter ever. Sony also expects operating profit at the division this fiscal year ending in March will reach a record high.<br />Production bottlenecks have restricted shipments of new PlayStation 5 consoles, but the company still managed to sell 4.5 million units during the quarter. The new console, however, likely isn’t profitable after the initial marketing and development costs. The profit boost likely came from selling more games, especially digitally, in the quarter. Revenue from digital games and add-ons grew 65% from a year earlier. Its subscription service for gamers PlayStation Plus added 1.5 million subscribers during the quarter.<br />Sony raised its operating income outlook for this fiscal year by 34% to ¥940 billion, equivalent to $9 billion, which implies an 11% year-over-year increase. The company originally expected a decline in operating profit, mainly due to worries about its image sensor business. The segment did suffer a decline, but demand from Apple’s new iPhones helped soften the blow.<br />What is more encouraging is that Sony’s entertainment businesses outside of gaming are also going well. Its movie segment was hurt by theater closures, but that was more than offset by higher income from licensing content. Music streaming revenues continued to be strong. Aniplex, its anime production company under the music segment, has helped distribute the animated movie “Demon Slayer,” which has notched an all-time box office record in Japan. The popularity of the franchise could also provide opportunities for Sony’s game and music businesses.</td>

Yet, Refinitiv’s share of the market against its rival has been declining for years. That underscores the LSE’s challenge, particularly given that some users say Bloomberg’s ubiquitous data terminal that is found on institutional trading desks around the world is more expensive than the equivalent from Refinitiv.<br />The company’s slice of the global market data pie as measured by revenue fell from a market-leading 32% in 2010 to 21% in 2019, according to data from Burton-Taylor, the research and advisory arm of London-based brokerage TP ICAP.

Now, the pressure is on to win them back.<br />Match showed impressive resilience early on in the pandemic, making use of its virtual lines of communication for singles to continue to mingle remotely. Tuesday’s fourth-quarter results were no exception, slightly topping Wall Street’s estimates for sales and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.<br />Match’s shares—often volatile heading into quarterly earnings to begin with—took a dive in mid-January following competitor Bumble’s initial public offering filing, but had since recovered most of those losses. Then its shares tumbled again 5% after hours following Tuesday’s report, which included conservative first-quarter guidance, particularly on the bottom line in what the company said is typically a lower-margin period.<br />Investors shouldn’t be overly discouraged: Match entered the fourth quarter having outperformed the midpoint of its initial guidance by between 3% and 14% over the past three years, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill. Impressively, its fourth-quarter numbers show it also met its initial revenue guidance for 2020, given way back in early November of 2019, before the first case of Covid-19 had even been identified.<br />For the past few years, the Match story has revolved around hookup app Tinder’s rapid growth. It now makes up well over half of the company’s overall revenue. Seeing this, many investors stepped to the sidelines amid the pandemic, as immediate gratification in online dating became as elusive as Lysol wipes and paper towels. Tinder’s annual direct revenue growth moderated from 43% in 2019 to just 18% last year.</td>

Apollo’s private-equity portfolio also appreciated 13% during the quarter compared with an 11.7% increase for the S&P 500.<br />But the firm’s financial performance may once again be overshadowed by Mr. Black’s relationship with Epstein, who was indicted in 2019 on federal sex-trafficking charges involving underage girls and later died by suicide in jail.<br />A recently concluded review by Dechert LLP backed up Mr. Black’s assertion that fees he paid Epstein, which the law firm said totaled $158 million, were for legitimate tax- and estate-planning advice. It found no evidence he was involved in Epstein’s criminal activities.<br />The question for Apollo’s shareholders is whether Mr. Black’s decision to cede the CEO role to co-founder Marc Rowan, announced with the findings of the review last week, will be enough to put to rest concerns of public pension funds and other institutions that commit money to the firm’s funds. Some had said they would hold off on new investments with the firm until they learned the findings of the review.</td>

      <td>Tonghua’s older population and weak economy make for new challenges when residents are shut in</td>
      <td>When the city of Tonghua in China’s northeast shut residents in their homes in response to new coronavirus cases in January, it forced a reckoning with some harsh economic realities in the aging rust-belt city.<br />Thousands complained on social media that they were running out of necessities such as food and medicine. It was the kind of hardship that hadn’t been seen since the lockdown of Wuhan for the first Covid-19 outbreak a year earlier. As many pleaded that they were starving, saying “Don’t forget us,” city officials apologized and said they were short-handed.<br />The city of around 2 million, near the North Korean border, is one of many in the northeast that have fallen on hard times as China has restructured its overbuilt steel industry. Growth is markedly slower and many younger people have left in search of work.<br />Nearly one in four residents in Tonghua is 60 years old or older, compared with a national average of about 18%, official data show. The city now has less money coming in while also having more retirees to support—fault lines that became more obvious in its draconian pandemic response.<br />Last year, Tonghua only reported six cases of Covid-19. But in January, after at least 49 residents who had visited a center selling health-care products for the elderly tested positive, a downtown section of the city became the most locked-down place in China. City officials taped apartment doors shut in entire housing complexes practically overnight.</td>

      <td>But streaming giant offers conservative outlook for the current year as new sign-ups could ebb</td>
      <td>Spotify Technology SA  posted stronger-than-expected subscription growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 as more listeners tuned into music and podcasts from home amid the coronavirus pandemic. Still, the streaming giant offered a conservative outlook for the current year as new sign-ups could ebb.<br />At the end of the fourth quarter, Spotify had 345 million monthly active users, hitting the high end of its guidance, an increase of 27% from the same period a year ago. Paying subscribers, its most lucrative type of customer, grew to 155 million, up 24% from the same period a year ago, and topping expectations.<br />Average revenue per user for the subscription business fell 8% to €4.26, the equivalent of $5.13, from a year ago, as the company continued to attract new subscribers via discounted plans and charge lower prices in new markets such as India and Russia. In October, Spotify raised the price of its family plan in seven markets, a move the company said didn’t affect churn or customer intake. In February, it expanded price increases to another 25 markets, including in Europe, Latin America and Canada.<br />Revenue from subscriptions rose 15% from the year before, to €1.89 billion. Advertising revenue grew for a second consecutive quarter after sliding in the first half of the year amid pandemic headwinds, jumping 29% to €281 million. Advertising, historically less than 10% of Spotify’s top line, accounted for 13% of revenue. It has become a growth area as the company expands its podcast business.<br />The company said it now has 2.2 million podcasts available on its service, and consumption hours nearly doubled from the prior-year quarter. During the period, 25% of its monthly active users listened to a podcast, up from 22% in the previous quarter. In December, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” which arrived on Spotify in September, became exclusive to the service. It is the No. 1 show in 17 markets, and has helped bring in new users as well as attract first-time podcast listeners, the company said.</td>

President Biden has said an equitable distribution of small-business aid is a priority as his administration seeks to address racial and economic inequality.<br />Lawmakers from both parties have praised the program for providing a vital lifeline to small businesses during the pandemic. Still, it has faced scrutiny over potential fraud and concerns the loans weren’t sufficiently reaching mom-and-pop and minority-owned firms.<br />Those concerns followed the program’s rocky rollout last spring, as businesses without existing relationships with lenders—which issue the loans—struggled to access the program early on.</td>

      <td>President Biden says his proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour will lift many low-wage workers out of poverty, but some businesses and economists warn it could cost jobs as the U.S. recovers from pandemic layoffs.<br />Mr. Biden endorses a plan to more than double the wage in steps over four years, noting that at $15 an hour, a job could support a family of four and it wouldn’t live in poverty. The president’s advisers also say raising the wage from $7.25 an hour, where it has stood since 2009, would show gratitude to essential workers at grocery stores and warehouses who stayed on the job during the coronavirus pandemic and would boost the economy by allowing low-wage workers to spend more.<br />Some large national employers have done well during the pandemic, Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of Mr. Biden’s National Economic Council, said in an interview. “The compensation for their employees hasn’t necessarily reflected that. Raising the minimum wage is one way of giving workers a more fair slice of the revenues that they help generate.”<br />Several states, including California, Florida and Massachusetts are already on a path to reach a $15 minimum wage in coming years, but Mr. Ramamurti said the floor should apply to areas with a lower cost of living. A federal minimum-wage increase requires congressional approval.<br />“No matter where you work in America, if you work full time or 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty,” he said. “A $15 minimum wage accomplishes that.”</td>

That led them to compromise other email accounts and as a result our broader [Office] 365 environment was compromised,” he said.<br />It is the latest development in the eight-week investigation into one of the worst breaches in U.S. history. SolarWinds, previously a little-known but critical maker of network-management software, is still trying to understand how the hackers first got into the company’s network and when exactly that happened.<br />One possibility is that the hackers may have compromised the company’s Office 365 accounts even earlier and then used that as the initial point of entry into the company, although that is one of several theories being pursued, Mr. Ramakrishna said.<br />Investigators are trying to determine how widespread the damage has been.

The drugmaker said its insurance companies have either disputed or declined to fully comply with their coverage obligations related to opioid-related litigation brought against Purdue.<br />The actual amount of insurance proceeds Purdue may wind up recovering will be determined in court, and claims made in the lawsuit will likely be challenged by the insurance companies. The lawsuit names several insurance companies, among them AIG Specialty Insurance Co. and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.<br />Purdue filed for chapter 11 protection in September 2019, with some support for a deal with creditors including states and municipalities to resolve claims for damages due to OxyContin’s alleged role in driving a nationwide epidemic of addiction that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.</td>

The company announced his changing role as it reported that revenue in the fourth quarter soared 44% to $125.56 billion—surpassing $100 billion for the first time in a three-month span—and profit more than doubled.<br />But Amazon also faces the biggest regulatory challenges in its history, with multiple federal investigations into its competitive practices and lawmakers drafting legislation that could force Amazon to restructure its business. Tension with regulators and lawmakers has directly embroiled Mr. Bezos, who was called to testify in front of Congress last summer for the first time.<br />Mr. Bezos’s leadership of Amazon has made him one of the most respected, and feared, leaders in business, as well as fantastically wealthy. He is currently neck-and-neck with his rival rocket entrepreneur, Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk, as the world’s wealthiest person.</td>

      <td>Party leaders grapple with controversies over Marjorie Taylor Greene, Liz Cheney</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The top two Republicans in Congress are charting different courses after former President Donald Trump lost the White House but not his grip on much of the party.<br />Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has distanced himself from Mr. Trump and taken aim at what he sees as the GOP’s extremist fringe, while House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has shored up his ties to the former president and urged members of his roiled caucus to stop attacking each other. Traditionally in lockstep, the leaders have rarely exposed such distance in their political calculations, as they contend with different intraparty divides on each side of the Capitol.<br />“Every party that loses the White House does a lot of blaming, finger-pointing and disarray, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said GOP strategist Terry Sullivan.<br />The debate centers on the direction of the party in the post-Trump era and the types of politicians it is willing to accept in its ranks, as it seeks to broaden its appeal in the electorate while not alienating voters loyal to Mr. Trump. The debate will continue Wednesday when the fate of two House members is expected to flare up at a House GOP meeting.<br />Mr. McConnell, who warned that disputing President Biden’s electoral victories could undermine democracy, hasn’t spoken with Mr. Trump since Dec. 15, the day after the Electoral College met. The Kentucky Republican harshly criticized Mr. Trump for his actions on the day of the Capitol riot, which led to his impeachment. He hasn’t yet said how he will vote in Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial, although he reiterated Tuesday that he has concerns over its constitutionality now that Mr. Trump is no longer in office.</td>

      <td>Books can help calm and transport you from pandemic stress. But many of us are finding it harder to read now. Here’s how—and why—to get back to it.</td>
      <td>This past year, I’ve found myself returning again and again to a line of poetry by Emily Dickinson: “There is no frigate like a book.”<br />Like many people, I’ve needed the therapeutic effects of reading more than ever this year. As neuroscientists and psychologists (and your high school English teacher) will tell you: Books are good for the brain. And their benefits are particularly vital now. Books expand our world, providing an escape and offering novelty, surprise and excitement, which boost dopamine. They broaden our perspective and help us empathize with others. And they can improve our social life, giving us something to connect over.<br />Books can also distract us and help reduce our mental chatter. When we hit that glorious “flow state” of reading where we’re fully immersed in a book, our brain’s default mode network likely calms down, says Jud Brewer, a psychiatrist who directs research at Brown University’s Mindfulness Center. That’s a network of brain regions that is active when we are not doing anything else and that can get absorbed in worrying and rumination.<br />“There’s so much noise in the world right now and the very act of reading is a kind of meditation,” says Mitchell Kaplan, owner of the Miami-based independent bookstores Books & Books and co-founder of the Miami Book Fair. “You disconnect from the chaos around you. You reconnect with yourself when you are reading. And there’s no more noise.”<br />In 2020, the NPD Group recorded the best year of book sales since it began tracking comparable data in 2004. Sales of print books, which make up 80% of the market, were up 8.2% by volume over 2019, while sales of e-books were up 17%. The sales were driven by a number of categories, according to NPD book analyst Kristen McLean: children’s books; adult nonfiction, especially books about race and civil rights; and biography and memoir.</td>

Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the bill less than two hours later.<br />The existing law made it a violation for someone to remain or wander in a public place, beckoning or stopping people or vehicles for the purpose of prostitution. The number of people primarily charged with the offense has declined in the past 10 years to six in 2020 from 882 in 2010, according to the state’s Division of Criminal Justice Services.<br />Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz, a Democrat from Queens, said she has transgender friends who were stopped by police “because of how they look and because they fit a certain profile.” She said she had been detained by police three times while walking in her home borough late at night, under suspicion of engaging in prostitution.</td>

Well, the science says schools can safely reopen, but the White House is still listening, make that bowing, to the non-scientists who run the teachers unions.<br />Mr. Biden has set a goal of reopening schools in his first 100 days, and the current union standoff in Chicago is his first big test. Elementary and middle school teachers there have refused to show up to classrooms as ordered. So the district has postponed reopening schools for two days. “We are practically begging [Chicago Teachers Union] to come to the table so we can get a deal done,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said.<br />No kidding. The district has surrendered to most union demands, which include allowing 5,000 or so employees to work from home because they have underlying health conditions. It has also spent $100 million on personal protective equipment, disinfectants, ventilation improvements, and portable air purifiers, and it will provide regular testing and contact tracing.<br />Yet now the union wants the district to let other staff work remotely if they wish and vaccinate teachers before they return to classrooms. If Chicago agrees to that, other unions would howl.<br />Ms. Lightfoot has been far too accommodating to the union, though she deserves credit for pushing at last to resume in-person learning. Large school districts in California including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Fresno have surrendered and are resisting Gov. Gavin Newsom’s exhortations to reopen.</td>

Liz Cheney from the House leadership for voting to impeach Donald Trump. Other Members are concerned about the high public profile of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a freshman Member from Georgia with kooky views. If the House GOP punishes Ms. Cheney while saying nothing about Ms. Greene, it will deserve a longer time in the wilderness.<br />Ms. Cheney’s impeachment decision was a vote of conscience, as GOP leaders said at the time. She joined nine others in voting to impeach Mr. Trump after an assault on the Capitol that followed weeks of false election claims from the White House. Some Republicans say Ms. Cheney has special obligations to reflect the GOP conference as a leader, but GOP leaders didn’t whip the vote and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was offering little guidance.<br />Ms. Cheney should get credit for daring to stand alone despite the political risks. The Trumpians are vowing to defeat her in a primary in 2022, and Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Trump acolyte, flew to a rally in Cheyenne last week to stir up opposition. Donald Trump Jr. called into the rally to promote a primary challenge to her in 2022.<br />If bowing before all things Trump is the litmus test for being a loyal Republican, the party should get used to continued losses in the suburbs. Mr. McCarthy should be defending his colleague’s vote as a matter of principle, even if he disagreed with it, rather than living in fear of the wrath of Mar-a-Lago.</td>

The charges of violating his parole from a previous conviction are a farce. This is a political arrest and sentence.<br />One lesson is that Mr. Putin and his gang must feel threatened. Protests in support of Mr. Navalny have been growing in major Russian cities. Mr. Putin has survived protests before, notably in 2012, but his popularity has sagged amid an economy weakened by lower oil prices and Western sanctions.<br />“[Putin’s] only method is killing people,” Mr. Navalny said in court. “For as much as he pretends to be a great geopolitician, he’ll go down in history as a poisoner.”<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a strong statement urging the Kremlin to “immediately and unconditionally release” Mr. Navalny and others arrested during the recent protests.

      <td>Amazon CEO’s transition comes following stellar performance—and ahead of big challenges</td>
      <td>There was never going to be an ideal time for Jeff Bezos to go. But now is probably as good as it is going to get.<br />“Go” is a relative term.  Amazon.com  took pains on Tuesday to point out that its famous founder isn’t really leaving. The company used the occasion of its fourth-quarter report to announce that Mr. Bezos is handing over the chief executive reins to Andy Jassy—a longtime lieutenant who has been running the company’s AWS cloud business since its inception. Mr. Bezos will become executive chair of the company, with the transition taking place in the third quarter of this year.<br />Still, it is a big move. Even in a tech industry that accords founders near mythic status, Mr. Bezos was in a world of his own.  Facebook  is the only other of the big tech giants still being actively managed by its founder, and Mr. Bezos was already a decade into his job when Mark Zuckerberg came up with the idea of the social network in his Harvard dorm. With 2020 revenue totaling about $386 billion, Amazon is also now more than four times the size of Facebook by that metric, and much larger than Apple,  Microsoft  or Google ever got under the management of their respective founders.<br />Still, a transition someday was inevitable—especially for a 57-year-old billionaire who likes to dabble in rockets, newspapers and life sciences. There likely won’t be a better time: Amazon just wrapped a year where its already strong businesses were boosted by the pandemic, which fueled both online shopping and demand for cloud-computing services. Fourth-quarter revenue and operating earnings blew past Wall Street’s estimates. Full-year sales surged 38%—the company’s best growth rate since 2011, when annual sales were about one-eighth their current level.<br />At the same time, the company faces an unprecedented number of challenges, especially as lawmakers and regulators crack down on big tech. Amazon is also unique among its big tech peers in that front-line workers make up such a big portion of its employee base, which now numbers nearly 1.3 million. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, told reporters Tuesday that Mr. Bezos will remain “very involved”—especially on so-called “one-way door decisions” that are difficult to undo. That helped Amazon’s share price recover in after-hours trading, following an initial drop on the news. Even for a company seeming to fire on all cylinders, investors don’t seem ready to let Jeff Bezos blast off quite yet.</td>

      <td>Disposable real per capita income rose 5.5% in 2020, the highest rate since 1984, due largely to transfer payments.</td>
      <td>Even among economists who strongly support President Biden, a consensus is growing that the economy emerged from last year set for a robust recovery. That view has been espoused by Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Barack Obama’s former top economist Jason Furman. Both have expressed concern that the economy may overheat.<br />The most encouraging sign that recovery will be strong as the vaccines take hold is not that real gross domestic product rose 7.5% in the third quarter, offsetting 83% of the economic collapse produced by the shutdown in the preceding quarter. Nor is it that 16 million of the 22 million jobs lost have been restored. The most encouraging sign is how much the total purchasing power of American families has expanded during the crisis, reaching record highs.<br />To be sure, many Americans have taken a serious hit: Commerce Department data show total employee compensation in the second and third quarters of 2020 was down by $215 billion compared with the first quarter. Yet government personal transfers were up $893 billion—four times the compensation lost. In the second quarter alone, real per capita disposable income was up 10.5% compared with the first quarter—25 times as fast as the average quarterly income growth in the prior two years.<br />This surge in personal income was driven by government stimulus equal to $2.6 trillion, more than all the private wages and salaries paid in the first quarter of 2020. While preliminary fourth-quarter figures show that personal income declined from the previous quarter, real per capita disposable income in 2020 grew 5.5%—the highest growth rate since 1984, the peak of the Reagan recovery. All of this occurred before the $900 billion December stimulus took effect.<br />So what happened to all that money? As transfer payments surged in the second quarter and the shutdown curtailed personal-consumption expenditures, pent-up purchasing power spiked. Quarterly savings rose by almost $800 billion. The historical savings rate of 7% to 8% of income reached an astonishing 26% in the second quarter. Preliminary data for 2020 show total savings for 2020 was $1.6 trillion higher than in 2019. And that was before the $900 billion stimulus.</td>

      <td>The left wants a spoils system on steroids. If the president gives it to them, heaven help us.</td>
      <td>President Biden likes to talk about “healing” and “unity,” but he also keeps pledging to prioritize the supposed interests of certain favored minority groups. When is he going to realize that his goals of racial unification and racial favoritism are at cross-purposes?<br />Last week Mr. Biden signed an executive order on “racial equity.” He said that George Floyd’s death last summer “marked a turning point in this country’s attitude toward racial justice” and is “forcing us to confront systemic racism and white supremacy.” He added that “this nation and this government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equity” and make it “not just an issue for any one department. It has to be the business of the whole government.”<br />Nothing quickens the pulse of progressives like talk of “systemic racism” and “white supremacy,” so it’s hard to know if Mr. Biden is just telling leftists what they want to hear. But if it’s more than that—if the president is serious about focusing on equal outcomes instead of equal opportunities—then heaven help us. Milton Friedman said the “society that puts equality before freedom will end up with neither,” while “the society that puts freedom before equality will end up with a great measure of both.” Of course, Friedman had a constrained view of the government’s capabilities that isn’t shared by very many Democrats today. For them, good intentions are what matter most.<br />The political left has long used racism as an all-purpose explanation for racial disparities. This ignores that disparities down through history have been the norm, not the exception, and that they exist even in regions of the world where most people are of the same race. The per capita income gap between people in Eastern Europe and Western Europe, for example, is wider than the gap between whites and blacks in the U.S. Moreover, racial disparities have both grown and narrowed over time, even though racism has been constant. If Mr. Biden wants to change the government’s approach to racial inequality, this history ought to inform his actions.<br />The greatest success of the civil-rights movement wasn’t a new government program but getting government off the backs of blacks by defeating Jim Crow. Nothing the government has done since then in the name of advancing blacks has been more effective than simply ending government-sponsored discrimination. Black poverty fell by 40 percentage points between 1940 and 1960. It continued to decline in the wake of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society interventions, but at a much slower pace.</td>

      <td>IMF ‘special drawing rights’ with no strings are the wrong way to help developing countries.</td>
      <td>Sometimes an idea gets legs in Washington that is so objectively bad, you’re almost tempted to admire it simply for beating the odds. Such is the case with left-wing claims that the International Monetary Fund must shower money on developing economies to beat Covid-19. Congressional Democrats have pushed repeatedly for time-sensitive “must pass” legislation to require the IMF to issue at least two trillion special drawing rights, or SDRs, to its 190 member countries, which governments could then exchange for nearly $3 trillion in hard currency to defend against the pandemic.<br />This isn’t what SDRs are for, and it’s almost certainly not how they would be used if Democrats in Congress got their wish. Under the IMF’s longstanding rules, SDRs are supposed to meet a “long-term global need” in reserves; they aren’t meant to arm countries for short-term spending emergencies.<br />Nor would that be feasible: There are no strings attached to how a government uses SDRs, and they never have to be repaid. Donor countries may want recipient states to focus on acquiring personal protective equipment, vaccines and the like, but the IMF and World Bank already have programs directing money to areas where it’s needed most. A blank check would surrender accountability for how the money is used, inviting waste and corruption.<br />Another likely scenario is that SDRs would eventually go to pay debts to the Chinese government, as well as to private creditors who piled into risky debt before the coronavirus emerged. As the foremost creditor to the developing world, Beijing has fought multilateral agreements to suspend poor nations’ debt repayments during the pandemic, only yielding in small ways. China has also resisted pressure from the U.S. and allies for greater transparency on its predatory lending terms. Lavishing SDRs on developing-world borrowers would make restructuring or forgiveness of Chinese government loans less likely, giving Beijing the green light to proceed with business as usual in a post-pandemic world. No wonder Yi Gang, governor of China’s central bank, has championed the cause of issuing more SDRs from the IMF.<br />It gets worse. Since the IMF must allocate SDRs to countries according to their shareholding weight in the organization, the neediest would be the least able to benefit. A rich IMF member like the Netherlands would receive more than three times as much as Nigeria. Or consider that New Zealand, despite having virtually eliminated Covid-19 on its shores, would be entitled to more SDRs than Congo. The fine citizens of Luxembourg, population 600,000, would get more than the 163 million Bangladeshis. The perverse examples go on and on.</td>

      <td>Robinhood might remind its customers that stocks are about something real.</td>
      <td>With the  GameStop  bubble coming to its foreordained conclusion on Tuesday the broader stock market was having its best day in a while. Internet progress is sometimes measured in pratfalls. The stumble of the free online brokerage Robinhood over its customers’ trading of GameStop actually hearkens to a precedent that has nothing to do with the Wall Street vs. little guy narrative that preoccupies some.<br />In 1996, dial-up internet pioneer America Online stopped charging by the hour in favor of a flat monthly fee. Unsurprisingly, customers instantly revealed a preference for being online all the time. But a symphony of busy signals exposed an unappreciated fact of AOL’s business model: It was reselling access to the regulated local phone system designed for calls that last six minutes, not all week.<br />Robinhood could give small-timers free brokerage because it was selling their order flow, and thus information about which stocks were in demand, to other intermediaries. This model worked until its customers drove GameStop to unrealistic heights for reasons of their own. Then a behind-the-scenes plumbing provider, Robinhood’s clearing agent, spoke up. It would not accept the risk of the brokerage or its customers failing to deliver the cash if prices collapsed during the hours or days before trades cleared. It demanded Robinhood put up collateral it didn’t have. So Robinhood curtailed its customers to buying just a single share of GameStop.<br />Boom. Suddenly conspiracy theories flowed about Wall Street biggies intervening to stop a phenomenon that had harmed their own bets that GameStop would fall (known as short selling).<br />Like AOL’s, Robinhood’s snafu was partly due to ancient, clunky infrastructure—in this case for certifying ownership of an asset, such as a share of stock or even a person’s ownership of his or her own identity.

      <td>There are so many diet programs to choose from—but do any of them work? One man’s try-anything search for a slimmer self.</td>
      <td>In the past two decades, one dimension of U.S. public health has undergone a shocking transformation: body weight. In 2000, the residents of West Virginia had an obesity rate of 23.9%, the highest of any U.S. state. By 2019, Colorado had nearly the same rate (23.8%), and it was the lowest of any state. Leaving aside a few small nations, the United States is the fattest country in the world, with an adult obesity rate exceeding 42%.<br />The disease and disability that accompany excess weight have contributed to higher health-care costs and lower life expectancy. They’ve also created a $72 billion industry devoted to telling people how to shed extra pounds. These combined conditions—reasons to worry and strategies to manage—set the stage for Barry Estabrook’s “Just Eat,” an enlightening first-person account focused on the diets that Americans attempt to follow and the cultures that seem to have found a healthy relationship with food.<br />Mr. Estabrook’s chronicle begins with his getting a physical—and admitting to himself that he is 40 pounds overweight. He is saddled with high cholesterol, so his doctor ups the dosage of a drug to treat it—to the maximum permissible level. But with high blood pressure, a family history of heart disease and a self-image as “lumpy,” Mr. Estabrook sees that something more is needed: He decides to go on the first diet of his life.<br />While his journalistic background includes food writing (he’s a former editor of Eating Well magazine), Mr. Estabrook poses as a dietary Everyman: no expert scientific or medical knowledge and no investment in any one regimen: “I had no horse in the race other than my rotund belly.” He believes that, if he can find a way of losing weight after an adulthood “defined by chubbiness and a spotty record in the willpower department,” then “anyone could.”<br />But he’s candid about the challenge he faces, citing studies showing that few people succeed by using diets to achieve long-term weight loss—and a lot of dieters end up adding weight. “In many ways,” he writes, “dieting is a multibillion-dollar scam.” Still, he gives it a try.</td>

Their investment of massive airtime certainly paid off, as the Trump era turned out to be a golden age for political controversy and news-like programming.<br />Back in 2015, staff at the two networks were likely happy to enlist in the Trump promotion project because they figured he was the Republican most likely to lose to Hillary Clinton. Their candidate ended up losing in 2016 but they could take consolation in a clear commercial victory.

Some restaurant chains have said they expect labor costs to rise this year as they pay to hire and retain workers in public-facing roles. The Biden administration is also looking to boost the minimum wage, which would translate into higher wages for many restaurant chains.</td>

No date has yet been set for that vote, a committee spokeswoman said.<br />Proposals to change agricultural practices are one piece of Mr. Biden’s push to tackle climate change, which was on display in three executive orders issued last week suspending new oil and gas leases on federal land and boosting offshore wind production.

Billy Graham, in 2018, have been so honored.<br />Many holders of public office, most recently Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, have lain in state in the Capitol building.<br />Capitol Police and other authorities haven’t released information regarding the specific circumstances of Mr. Sicknick’s death, other than to say he died from injuries sustained while trying to protect those trapped in the Capitol on Jan. 6. Prosecutors have said they are examining whether anyone can be charged with murder in connection with his death. While more than a dozen rioters have been charged with assaulting or obstructing law-enforcement officers during the riot, no charges have been brought in connection with Mr. Sicknick.

But Mr. Mayorkas’s nomination was slowed after several Republican senators including Sens. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) and John Cornyn (R., Texas) objected over immigration policy differences.<br />Mr. Mayorkas faces an array of challenges, from slowing the pandemic to handling cyberattacks against government agencies and a growing domestic terrorism threat, but senators focused on immigration during Mr. Mayorkas’s January confirmation hearing.</td>

Koplewicz says even small steps can help parents foster resilience and self-reliance in their children.<br />Dr. Koplewicz, the president and medical director of the Child Mind Institute in New York and California, lays out his parenting approach in “The Scaffold Effect,” which is being published today.

How does parenting need to change?<br />Self-care is so essential. Self-care is child care, particularly during Covid.

      <td>FOR STIR-crazed Americans wrestling with the virus and its variants while awaiting the vaccine, the dream of roaming pedal-to-the-medal across the continent is a transfixing one. “In quarantine you’re not just stuck in a place physically, you’re stuck mentally, and travel opens up your thoughts,” said Chicago photographer Jasmin Shah who made several cross-country trips last year. Whatever the inspiration, be it Sacagawea, Kerouac or “Thelma & Louise,” it’s still possible to conduct an epic cross-country road trip during the pandemic. But do plenty of research before heading out the door. Think about “snacks, water, cleaning supplies and stops,” said Paula Twidale, senior vice-president of travel at the American Automobile Association (AAA), who ticked off a list of precautions to consider. “You need to plan ahead to have freedom and flexibility.” Covid-19 restrictions, quarantines, openings and closings change frequently so check them often. AAA, for example, posts such information on the organization’s travel planning site triptik.aaa.com. Ms. Twidale’s team of travel planners outline three memorable trips:<br />Crossing the continent via Interstates 80 and 90 would take 42 hours straight through, but Ms. Twidale cautions travelers not to rush the 2,852-mile-long route. Bisecting 11 states, the journey offers plenty to see and do. The route includes urban layovers in Cleveland, with a visit to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and Chicago for its deep-dish pizza (locals like delivery from Lou Malnati’s) with a stop by Lake Michigan. In South Dakota, visit the town of Mitchell and its Corn Palace. From Montana, a short southern detour to Wyoming will deliver you to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, before finally ending by Puget Sound in Seattle and a visit to the Space Needle. (Amazon’s twin Spheres, however, are closed.)<br />Any list of cross-country trips should include Route 66, the country’s “Mother Road” between the Midwest and California before the Interstate Highway System. “It’s going back in time,” Ms. Twidale said about making the 2,448-mile-long drive. AAA’s recommended stops include iconic monuments like the St. Louis Gateway Arch and quirky roadside attractions like Illinois’s 1924 Ariston Café, or the Cadillac Ranch art installation in Amarillo, Tex. In Arizona slight detours will take you to Grand Canyon and Petrified Forest national parks and if you need a respite, sleep over in Holbrook’s Wigwam Motel. In California you’ll pass near the desert wilds of Joshua Tree and Death Valley national parks before concluding the trip in Los Angeles at the Santa Monica Pier on the Pacific Ocean. Order a celebratory takeout meal at nearby local favorite Chez Jay.<br />This 2,032-mile-long road trip features stops along the U.S. Civil Rights Trail, a collection of destinations in 16 mostly southern states and Washington, D.C., that highlight Black Americans’ fight for justice, and concludes in Denver. Begin at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial in Washington near the Lincoln Memorial, location of his 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech. Stop in Greensboro, N.C., the city famous for its Woolworth lunch counter sit-ins. In Memphis, Tenn., see the Lorraine Motel, part of the National Civil Rights Museum, and site of Dr. King’s assassination. In Topeka, Kan., explore the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site commemorating the 1954 Supreme Court ruling that began the country’s desegregation efforts. In Colorado, visit the Black American West Museum (temporarily closed) and take a walking tour of Five Points, Denver’s historic Black neighborhood. Once the “Harlem of the West,” it’s now filled with galleries, restaurants and microbreweries.<br />Carry pandemic precautions including extra masks, hand sanitizer, disposable gloves for pumping gas, and check openings and closures before arrival.</td>

Yet the return comes with a twist, the company says: the new games, for now, will feature real teams, but not specific players, in a bet that gamers will care more about the name on the front of the jersey than those on the back.<br />EA’s intention to re-enter the college-sports arena comes in the middle of a complex debate involving Congress, state legislatures and the National Collegiate Athletic Association over how and whether to compensate student-athletes.<br />Under a deal announced Tuesday with collegiate-trademark company CLC, EA is gaining exclusive rights to make games that simulate U.S. college football. Game development work is just getting started, the company said, so it could take a few years before any new title comes to market.<br />EA has secured the rights to team logos, uniforms and other college game-day traditions, a company spokesman said. EA, for now, isn’t planning to include player names or likenesses in new games due to uncertainty around rules from the NCAA, the largest nonprofit body supervising U.S. college sports, the spokesman said. The NCAA currently restricts third parties from using those attributes but that could soon change as the organization has committed to rewriting its bylaws amid pressure from high-profile litigation and state legislation.<br />The announcement comes as EA is slated to release its quarterly financial report after markets close today. Analysts expect the company to show strong growth in its business as the pandemic continues to fuel demand for at-home entertainment, after markets close today.</td>

      <td>The deadly nerve agent was developed in the Soviet Union</td>
      <td>Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny was sentenced to serve about 3½ years in prison following his return from Germany where he was transported after a near fatal poisoning attempt last August. Prosecutors had requested that a suspended sentence Mr. Navalny received in 2014 be turned into real prison time, for what authorities said was repeated violations of the terms of his parole, including when he was recuperating in a Berlin hospital. The 3½-year sentence credits the time Mr. Navalny served under house, leaving him to serve 32 months behind bars. European authorities say Novichok, a military-grade chemical nerve agent, was used in the attack against the political activist.<br />It is a deadly nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union and then Russia as a more potent and harder-to-detect alternative to VX and soman. Its existence was first revealed in the early 1990s by a dissident scientist as Moscow prepared to enter the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention to end the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons.<br />Novichok is carried in two parts that are combined to create a viscous liquid just before it is administered—making it difficult to detect. It disrupts the way nerve cells communicate with each other, interfering with muscle control and potentially causing respiratory and cardiac arrest.

      <td>MOSCOW—A Russian court sentenced Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to 3½ years in prison, but gave credit for about a year already served, sidelining the country’s most prominent opposition politician and likely fueling a burgeoning protest movement triggered by his detention last month.<br />Mr. Navalny, who was kept in a glass cage throughout the hearing, laughed to himself as the judge read the lengthy verdict. He drew a heart with his finger and looked at his wife, Yulia, as the judge neared the end of the sentencing.<br />During his testimony, the opposition politician blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for a poisoning attack against him last year and called the court proceedings against him an act of cowardice. Striking at the image of Mr. Putin as a master strategist, he said the Kremlin leader never fought his enemies fairly.<br />“[Putin’s] only method is killing people,” Mr. Navalny said. “For as much as he pretends to be a great geopolitician, he’ll go down in history as a poisoner.”<br />Following the verdict, Mr. Navalny’s supporters called for people to take to a central square near the Kremlin, where riot police, with shields and batons, had already assembled. By late evening, police had already detained some protesters there.</td>

      <td>LONDON—Capt. Tom Moore, a British military veteran who shot to fame last year after raising millions of pounds for charity by walking lengths of his garden during lockdown, has died at age 100 after contracting the coronavirus.<br />Capt. Moore’s family said on Twitter that he had been fighting pneumonia and had tested positive for the coronavirus in January. During the last year, the World War II veteran became a mascot for a British nation plagued by Covid-19, raising millions for health workers, recording a No. 1 single, publishing a book and being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his efforts.<br />His arrival on the public stage happened almost by accident. After Britain went into lockdown last spring, he announced a sponsored walk round the garden in his home in Marston Moretaine just north of London. Age 99, he planned to walk a hundred lengths of the garden and raise £1,000—about $1,365—for charities linked to the National Health Service. The quest became an internet sensation. He raised almost £33 million.<br />“For all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment: The sun will shine on you again and the clouds will go away,” said Capt. Moore after completing his walk.<br />Queen Elizabeth II paid tribute to Capt. Moore, “recognising the inspiration he provided for the whole nation and others across the world.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said “in the face of this country’s deepest postwar crisis he united us all, he cheered us all up, and he embodied the triumph of the human spirit.” A Union Jack above Downing Street was flown at half-mast.</td>

      <td>Fashion insiders share their favorite eco-conscious labels and how they’re making a difference</td>
      <td>NEXT TO sweatpants and Zoom shirts, sustainability might be the hottest thing in fashion right now. Consumers—especially younger ones—increasingly expect more from the brands they patronize: more transparency, more accountability, more emphasis on ethical practices. You should, however, take any brand’s claims that its products are “sustainable” with a grain of salt. “Sustainable” is a vague, catch-all term that can be exploited for marketing purposes. A brand that sells only locally produced clothes made from recycled fabric can use the word—but so can one that works with harmful chemicals yet occasionally releases a limited run of vegan-leather shoes. “It’s like saying food is ‘natural.’ It’s very broad,” said Kayla Gil, owner and curator of Seattle’s Pipe & Row boutique. That doesn’t mean that shoppers hoping to lighten their carbon footprints should give up—it just means they should do a little homework.<br />Experts encourage customers hoping to shop more eco-consciously to go beyond the claims on a brand’s website and to research the brand’s track record and goals via articles from reliable news outlets and independent platforms like stand.earth, a climate watchdog organization, or Greenpeace’s Detox campaign, which tracks fashion brands’ use of hazardous chemicals. “Today, I just don’t think you can have a fashion brand without being responsible,” said Julie Gilhart, the chief development officer of fashion consulting firm Tomorrow Ltd, who has worked in the fashion industry for more than 20 years. “But there are lots of different levels: [Brands and designers] who are more advanced in their knowledge; some that are just learning how to change things; some that are just beginning. Make sure that there’s an intention to grow their responsibility. And if they have none, move to another brand.”<br />We asked four fashion insiders to spotlight brands that are legitimately striving for eco-consciousness and delivering on their promises. Learn about their favorites, below.<br />Founder of Gil Rodriguez<br />I love the Paris-based brand Tricot. They do really classic pieces out of recycled cashmere and the quality is beautiful. I look at sustainability from the perspective of buying less. Treating clothing as disposable, regardless of how it’s made is still incredibly wasteful. I focus on buying vintage things that have already had a life and then picking up a great new basic that I’ll wear for a long time.</td>

      <td>The continent wanted to teach the world a lesson in solidarity. Now its vaccination plan is falling apart.</td>
      <td>As Western governments faced criticism for their pandemic management last summer, European Union officials began work on a vaccine-procurement plan they hoped would put the continent at the forefront of efforts to banish the coronavirus and reopen economies.<br />Instead of its 27 member states fighting for doses from a few manufacturers, the European Commission, the closest the bloc has to a government, would centralize purchases for some 450 million inhabitants, bringing prices down and ensuring that residents of rich and poor countries alike would get equal access to the best shots available.<br />Half a year later, an acute shortage of doses is keeping the EU’s vaccination effort from taking off, making it likely that only a small portion of the general public will get a shot by the end of summer. The reasons: The EU was late in ordering vaccines compared with the U.S. and the U.K.; it bet on companies that have yet to deliver; and when delays started creeping in, it blamed the manufacturers instead of restarting negotiations.<br />“There are about 10 hard weeks of vaccine deficiency ahead of us,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn told journalists over the weekend. “More [vaccines] could have been ordered, and faster.”<br />Israel has vaccinated 55% of its population, the U.K. 14% and the U.S. 9.4%, against just 2.8% for the EU. At current rates, only two members, Malta and Romania, will have immunized one-third of their population by the end of the year, according to a Jan. 29 report by UBS.</td>

      <td>Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek star as an unlikely duo on a drug-induced quest to prove that their world is a simulation in this sci-fi film written and directed by Mike Cahill.</td>
      <td>Writer-directorMike Cahill’s 2011 “Another Earth” was a tantalizing feature, in large part because its sci-fi elements orbited at an oblique angle: The heart of the story was recklessness, tragedy and a young woman’s need for redemption. Only tangentially did it involve an alternative planet, a parallel reality and a correctable past. It was off-handedly fantastic, thus plausible. It was everything “Bliss” is not.<br />Directed by Mr. Cahill from his own screenplay, the Amazon Original “Bliss” stars Owen Wilson as Greg Wittle, an employee of a company called Technical Difficulties (“We’re sorry you’re having technical difficulties,” hundreds of employees recite into hundreds of phones). This by itself is not a harbinger of good news, nor is it particularly subtle: As becomes clear very quickly, Greg is malfunctioning. His wife has recently kicked him out. His daughter, Emily (Nesta Cooper), is inviting him to her graduation, which he’s reluctant to attend. He’s been feigning various physical injuries, it appears, and has run out of opioid refills (as he’s told by an impatient pharmacist). The boss wants to see him, right away; he crushes a pill into snortable form before answering the summons.<br />We sympathize with his plight, but we also see soon enough why his fellow employees might hate him. Which they quite obviously do.<br />Mr. Cahill gives us Greg on the cusp of a meltdown, with his life collapsing in two directions at once—homeless criminality on the one hand, intoxicated euphoria on the other. Fleeing his office, where things have gone terribly wrong, he visits the corner bar—Plato’s Dive, not insignificantly—where he meets the magically unreal Isabel Clemens (Salma Hayek). A much-tattooed, ornately attired street person—or witch, or prostitute with a drug habit similar to Greg’s—Isabel can control people and things with a wave of her hand, or so it seems. And she informs Greg that while they occupy a “real” reality, most of what they’re seeing isn’t there at all. They need to procure more of the enchanted amber crystals they ingest “in order to exit this stupid simulation.” Much of their time is occupied in doing just that and flitting from skid row to paradise. The viewer, meanwhile, is wondering why he should buy into any of it.<br />Mr. Wilson has always seemed congenitally sardonic and Ms. Hayek, quite game given the material, is a comedian at heart. So neither seems wholly committed to the seriousness of “Bliss”—and if the story isn’t serious, what is it? As it irreparably slips the cumbersome bonds of reality, entering a drug-induced world where dosage determines action and location, it seems to be a parable about addiction, while also suggesting that if one had enough drugs one could permanently exist in a state of bliss. As this cannot happen, Greg’s story is just terribly sad, in a way that all the hallucinations in his head can’t make more palatable for the viewer.</td>

      <td>The expert class will continue to create their opinions within their own bubble of reinforcing data, leaving a wide open political landscape for those willing to venture beyond those self-imposed constraints.</td>
      <td>Barton Swaim’s “Trump and the Failure of the Expert Class” (op-ed, Jan. 23) describes how the “experts” got it wrong in 2016 because they were totally out of touch with the average American and misread the mood of the voter. The flashing light that should have been a signal to the pollsters, consultants and political pundits was the consistent 30%, plus or minus, support for Bernie Sanders and similar support for Donald Trump throughout the Democratic and Republican primaries. The conclusion to be drawn was that approximately 60% of all Americans were fed up with the establishment “business as usual” political system and were looking for drastic change either in the form of a self-avowed socialist or populist. When Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination, it was no surprise that Bernie supporters either stayed home or voted for Donald Trump.<br />Mr. Swaim points out the inability of experts who “acknowledge no error,” leaving little doubt they will continue to misread the mood of the American people. According to a December 2020 Gallup poll, Congress’s approval rating was 15%, indicative of the public’s disdain for how the government is being run. Antifa-encouraged riots, continued strong support for Sen. Sanders and his agenda and the 2020 election results showing President Trump received more votes (including those of African-Americans and Latinos) than any previous Republican should be a wake-up call for the Republican Party. If Republicans want to be relevant in future elections, they should recognize Americans on both sides of the political spectrum are tired of the status quo, which isn’t working for them.<br />Members of the expert class will continue to create their opinions within their own bubble of reinforcing data, leaving a wide-open political landscape for those willing to venture beyond those self-imposed constraints.<br />Ken Dropek<br />Houston</td>

      <td>The sky is not falling for the oil and gas industry and there is neither a shortage of federal oil and gas leases nor a need for expanding production.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Fossil-Fuel Freeze” (Jan. 23): The federal leasing system has been a mess for a long time. Overproduction and a glut in global oil markets has driven prices down and bankruptcies up since 2015—long before the pandemic. In other words, there is no urgency to lease more federal land for drilling, a course the Trump administration blindly pursued. Most lease sales have one bidder, many none at all. Leases often sell for $2 per acre. Millions of leased acres sit idle and will probably never enter production. In the recent, highly contentious Arctic National Wildlife Refuge lease sale, the biggest bidder was the state of Alaska, and no major oil producers submitted bids at all.<br />Moreover, royalties from mineral development on federal land have been an important revenue stream for western states like New Mexico. Yet the same 12.5% royalty rate has applied since 1920s, while oil-rich states like Texas charge as much as 25% for drilling on state lands.<br />The sky is not falling for the oil and gas industry, and there is neither a shortage of federal oil and gas leases nor a need for expanding production.<br />Autumn Hanna<br />Taxpayers for Common Sense</td>

The company, which has a market value of about $25 billion, has been an active acquirer in recent years as it diversifies. A deal for Planters would be by far its largest to date.<br />Kraft Heinz, the product of a 2015 merger of the two well-known food companies, has been divesting brands after it struggled to keep up with shifting consumer tastes.

Ask our opinion,” Mr. Ponte advised. “Once we understand what you are looking for, we might go beyond what’s in the case and offer something extra special.” Be sure to share your personal tastes. Ms. Welch always asks customers, “Do you like lean cuts or fatty cuts? Grass-fed or grain-finished? These conversations are important in finding the best steak for you.” Smart shoppers should seek freshly cut meat with a deep rosy color and check for even marbling throughout fattier cuts.<br />Another great reason to talk to your butcher: They often share cooking tips, noting that some cuts are more foolproof than others. “I find that a steak that’s at least 1¼ to 1½ inches thick tends to be more forgiving when you cook it,” Mr. Abeyta said. Ms. Welch singles out tenderloin as a “low-risk” cut, while Mr. Cason points to skirt steak as particularly salvageable. “It cooks quick and easy, and if you overcook it you can cut it up and put it on a salad or use it in a stir-fry.”<br />For ingredients, all you need in addition to meat are salt, pepper and cooking fat. Ms. Welch advocates for cooking steak in beef tallow. “Its high smoke point allows it to conduct heat very well,” she said. Otherwise, the butchers recommend light oils such as avocado, canola or extra-light olive oil. Avoid regular olive oil as it burns on high heat and can add a bitter flavor to the meat.<br />Mr. Sanchez is a staunch endorser of obtaining and using an instant-read meat thermometer. “It really helps, especially for amateur cooks, to get the meat to the temperature you are seeking,” he said.</td>

The Biden administration is still weighing broader sanctions.<br />“After careful review of the facts and circumstances, we have assessed that Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma’s ruling party, and Win Myint, the duly elected head of government, were deposed in a military coup on February 1,” a State Department official said Tuesday, using another name for Myanmar. “We continue to call on the Burmese military leadership to release them and all other detained civil society and political leaders immediately and unconditionally.”<br />For the day and a half since reports of the military take-over in Myanmar emerged, the Biden administration had refrained from calling the action a coup, saying the matter was under legal review.</td>

      <td>Google’s YouTube has ratcheted up censorship to a new level by removing two videos from a U.S. Senate committee. They were from a Dec. 8 Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on early treatment of Covid-19. One was a 30-minute summary; the other was the opening statement of critical-care specialist Pierre Kory.<br />Dr. Kory is part of a world-renowned group of physicians who developed a groundbreaking use of corticosteroids to treat hospitalized Covid patients. His testimony at a May Senate hearing helped doctors rethink treatment protocols and saved lives.<br />At the December hearing, he presented evidence regarding the use of ivermectin, a cheap and widely available drug that treats tropical diseases caused by parasites, for prevention and early treatment of Covid-19. He described a just-published study from Argentina in which about 800 health-care workers received ivermectin and 400 didn’t. Not one of the 800 contracted Covid-19; 58% of the 400 did.<br />Dr. Kory asked the National Institutes of Health to review his group’s manuscript outlining dozens of successful trials and to consider updating its Aug. 27 guidance in which it recommended “against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19, except in a clinical trial.” On Dec. 10, Sen. Rand Paul and I sent a letter to the NIH requesting that it review Dr. Kory’s evidence.<br />On Jan. 14, NIH changed its guidance to neutral by acknowledging the successful trials but determined “that currently there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19.” On Jan. 22 I sent an oversight letter asking what actions the NIH had taken to explore the use of repurposed drugs for treating Covid-19.</td>

      <td>The best shot at a bipartisan bill is focusing on relief, not structural change.</td>
      <td>The Covid-19 relief bill is the first test for the Biden administration. It’s no surprise there’s disagreement on how to proceed. One controversy is strategic: How vigorously should the administration pursue bipartisan support for its legislation, and what price should it be willing to pay to achieve it? Some Democrats—myself among them—believe that the president’s calls for unity will be hollow unless he does all he can to reach a bipartisan agreement that satisfies his core objectives. Monday’s meeting with 10 Republican senators to discuss their $618 billion offer was a good first step, and conversations will continue.<br />In the end compromise may be out of reach, and Mr. Biden could be forced to depend on Democratic votes. Then the question will be if the arcane congressional process of “budget reconciliation” is compatible with political reconciliation. The optimists hope that the president can start with one-party government and shift to bipartisanship later; the pessimists fear that early partisanship will poison the well for the next two years. I believe that the preponderance of the evidence supports the pessimists, but Mr. Biden will have to make a tough call.<br />The other controversy is over policy: What does an adequate response to the pandemic require? Nearly everyone agrees that the federal government should do more to help states and localities vaccinate their populations as quickly as possible. Most agree on money for more testing, personal protective equipment, and treatments for those who contract Covid-19. More assistance for small businesses also enjoys broad support, despite doubts from economists that such programs are an effective and efficient use of public resources.<br />But then agreement breaks down. The Senate Republican plan meets the administration’s funding request for vaccinations and other health-related measures, but offers less for extended unemployment payments, aid to schools, and checks to individuals. It doesn’t increase the child tax credit and provides no direct aid to states and localities. But even this may be too much for House Republicans.<br />Step back from the details, and it’s clear the administration proposals serve four distinct policy objectives: relief, stimulus, investment and structural change. The details matter, but measures to mitigate immediate hardship enjoy the broadest support. Measures to promote economic and social change—such as increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour—are the least popular. Proposed investments for the future, such as rebuilding and restocking the National Strategic Stockpile, are also widely supported, in part because of their relatively modest cost.</td>

      <td>Lists of easy-care greenery always include the same species—from snake plant to rubber tree. We asked horticulturalists to recommend five handsome, no-brainer alternatives.</td>
      <td>THE INTERNET BRIMS with recommendations for houseplants that are tough to kill. But the same suggestions—ZZ plants, snake plants, rubber plants—crop up again and again. To break the botany monotony, we consulted horticulturalists who create and maintain plantscapes for office lobbies, hotels and other public spaces. Could they point us to less ubiquitous varieties that are just as low-care? “We prefer plants that are relatively drought-tolerant, pest-resistant and don’t frequently shed leaves,” said Louise Fair, a Seattle-area interior landscaper. Here, five examples of no-fuss flora that stand out from the crowd.<br />Philodendrons thrive in bright, indirect light, and they need water only once a week. For a twist on the typical heart-shaped leaf on tendril stems, consider the Philodendron selloum variety, said Katy McEvoy, a San Francisco plant pro whose clients include Google and YouTube. She likes how architectural and exotic its dark, deeply lobed and ripple-edged leaves are. Selloum can reach 5 feet tall, ideal for cultivating drama in a living-room corner. “I love how they grow up and arching, like a Vegas showgirl’s headpiece,” she said.<br />Classic Monsteras, with their glossy split leaves and chill Mexican vibes, have shown up in recent years on wallpapers, phone cases and everything in between. Less clichéd is the Monstera adansonii, which has holes instead of splits and an adorable nickname: the Monkey Mask. “I lean toward plants that add drama or create a moment,” said New York interior landscaper Luke Norden, whose clients include Fresh Direct’s headquarters in the Bronx. “Monstera adansonii is so sculptural, and it’s incredibly easy to grow—especially in indirect light—making it ideal for New York apartments.”<br />You know the snake plant (scientific name: Sansevieria trifasciata). You probably have a snake plant. Your cousin probably has one. So does your dentist’s waiting room. Ms. McEvoy likes this other member of the family, the Sansevieria starfish. Its chubby, tubular leaves taper to a point and splay, unlike its rigidly vertical relative, making it a fun choice. “I use it in designs when I want to release my inner punk rocker,” she said. It will grow in any light, and generally needs water every other week—even once a month.<br />Of the fiddle-leaf fig tree, Ms. McEvoy said, “It’s been done to death.” Ficus audrey, an oval-leafed sister plant and much-less-finicky alternative, “has a striking silhouette and deep green, white-veined leaves.” While audreys love bright light, they’re forgiving of filtered light. They’re also more tolerant of a less-consistent watering schedule.</td>

Tuesday’s announcement marks the largest deal to date in the U.S. online alcohol space, according to the Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America, a trade group representing more than 350 distributors.<br />Delivery has become an unexpected lifeline for Uber as the pandemic has hammered its core ride-hailing business. The company acquired food-delivery rival Postmates Inc. last year in a stock deal valued at $2.65 billion.<br />That combination made its Uber Eats business the second-largest food-delivery company in the U.S. after  DoorDash Inc.  Both companies have shored up their delivery offerings during the health crisis. Uber began delivering groceries in the U.S. and Canada last year, after acquiring Chilean startup Cornershop. DoorDash started delivering cleaning supplies and over-the-counter medicines from 7-Eleven convenience stores,  Walgreens  and CVS, among others.<br />The pandemic turbocharged online sales of alcohol, a category that has long lagged behind other consumer goods products in the U.S. and some other key markets due to strict regulations and entrenched consumer habits. E-commerce made up just 1% of U.S. alcohol sales by retailers in 2019 by volume but is expected to grow to 7% by 2024, says industry tracker IWSR.</td>

Though Ms. Cooney tried to power through the chill, “I couldn’t Bernie it,” she said, referring to the Vermont senator who inspired a meme by attending the inauguration in woolly mittens—great for cozily witnessing history, lousy for typing.<br />To cope, Ms. Cooney did what countless others have this winter: She bought a space heater. But she wasn’t willing to settle for one of the infernal cages Grannies have been known to wheel out to save a few dollars on the gas bill. “I didn’t want an eyesore,” she said, or, for that matter, a fire hazard in her wood-beamed home.<br />After a thorough hunt, she splurged on a handsome Dyson Pure Hot+Cool HP04 ($650, dyson.com), which can heat or cool up to 800 square feet, and features a built-in air purifier as well as the ability to monitor air quality on the unit’s screen. (The activated carbon and glass HEPA filter on the slightly newer Dyson HP06, $750, can also capture and destroy formaldehyde in the air.) “I wanted something that would work for me year round,” Ms. Cooney said.<br />The Dyson is among a new class of stylish yet powerful, remote-controlled, or even app-enabled heaters that let you adjust the temperature without having to slink off-screen during a Zoom call.

      <td>The big challenge for the next boss of  Ferrari  will be managing the racing-car brand’s strategy for cutting tailpipe emissions.<br />The pandemic halted the car manufacturer’s production lines for seven weeks—with a 10% knock-on reduction in sales last year, the company reported Tuesday. Otherwise, Ferrari has cruised through the crisis with few scratches. It projects a rebound in revenue this year to roughly 13% more than its pre-pandemic 2019 total, underpinned by strong orders since last summer. The shares fell 5% in morning trading, perhaps because some investors were hoping for an even stronger outlook from a company that has routinely beat expectations in recent years.<br />Since its 2015 initial public offering, investors have gradually come to treat Ferrari as an exception to the general rule that car makers are capital-intensive, low-margin businesses whose shares are better suited to hedge-fund trades than long-term money. Given its small production volumes and big backlog of orders from ultrarich clients, they see the Italian company as a luxury-goods maker, not a metal basher.<br />But in one respect Ferrari is like other car makers: It needs to reinvent its powertrains. Environmental rules are tightening everywhere, punishing supercars, which produce disproportionate carbon emissions per mile. Consumer attitudes also are greener among younger generations that Ferrari needs to cultivate as future clients.<br />Former Chief Executive Louis Camilleri, who stepped down unexpectedly in December following a bad case of Covid-19, didn’t dodge the problem, investing in hybrid technology and decarbonizing production. The company delivered its first hybrid model, the SF90 Stradale, in the fourth quarter.</td>

      <td>Skyworks, Cirrus Logic show benefits and risks of Apple dependency</td>
      <td>Apple Inc.  is definitely having a moment. For the many chip companies who supply the tech giant, the question remains just how long that moment will last.<br />Last week, Apple reported its best quarter in years. It enjoyed strength across its business segments, but the key driver was the iPhone—which still accounts for more than half the company’s total revenue. iPhone revenue jumped 17% year over year to a record $65.6 billion for the December quarter, thanks mainly to the launch of the new iPhone 12 models in the fall. Apple no longer discloses unit sales, but market research firms IDC, Canalys and Counterpoint estimate the company shipped between 82 million and 90 million iPhones during the quarter, which would also break the record 78.3 million units the company reported for the same quarter of 2016.<br />That is great news for the companies who supply key iPhone components. Skyworks, which specializes in radio-frequency chips, last week reported a 69% year-over-year jump in December-quarter revenue to $1.5 billion—42% above Wall Street’s expectations. The stock has climbed 15% since that report.  Cirrus Logic ,  whose chips are used for audio encoding, reported Monday that its December-quarter revenue rose 30% from a year earlier to about $486 million.<br />More are on the way.  Qorvo ,  a Skyworks competitor, is expected to post a 23% increase in revenue for the December quarter on Wednesday, according to consensus analyst forecasts. Also coming Wednesday is December-quarter results from  Qualcomm ,  which recently won back its place in the iPhone’s modem chip socket. Analysts expect Qualcomm to post an 80% year-over-year quarterly rise in chipset revenue, according to FactSet.<br />But dependency on Apple can backfire. Over the long term, suppliers face the risk that Apple could design them out with its own in-house chips. Over the short term, seasonal fluctuations can also hurt. Cirrus projected March-quarter revenue in a range of $280 million to $320 million—the midpoint of which was only in line with Wall Street’s estimates. That would represent 7% growth year over year, a significant slowdown from the previous quarter. The company warned in its letter to shareholders that “our customers can, and frequently do, change individual orders on short notice.” Apple accounted for 84% of Cirrus’ revenue for the past three quarters, according to the company’s quarterly filing Monday. Cirrus shares were down 5% Tuesday morning.</td>

Tony Capuano, the group president for global development, design and operations services, will be in charge of the company’s U.S. and Canada lodging division and finance, it added. Both executives are assuming additional responsibilities on top of their current jobs.<br />“While I have worked throughout my treatment to date and plan to remain as engaged in the business as my health allows, the right thing to do for me, my family and the company is to focus on my health,” Mr. Sorenson said. He said his treatment is being handled at Johns Hopkins.<br />Mr. Sorenson led the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide in September 2016, creating a hotel giant with a presence in 130 countries and territories. The company has 30 hotel brands, including Sheraton, Ritz-Carlton, Westin, Le Méridien, Courtyard and Aloft.</td>

      <td>The former president plans to argue the process is unconstitutional because he is out of office</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Donald Trump and House impeachment managers will give the Senate details of their respective strategies Tuesday ahead of the trial on a charge that the former president incited a riot at the U.S. Capitol, with Mr. Trump’s team planning to argue that the entire exercise is unconstitutional.<br />Mr. Trump had until noon to respond to a summons, while the House Democrats prosecuting the case had until 10 a.m. to submit a trial brief. Under the rough rules sketched out for the trial, the parties are charged with answering two main questions: whether Mr. Trump can be tried in the Senate for acts committed when he was president, and how they respond to the charge of “incitement of insurrection.”<br />Forty-five of the Senate’s 50 Republicans last week sided on a procedural vote with the argument that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional because Mr. Trump is now a private citizen, and Mr. Trump’s legal team plans to emphasize that point. The key premise of Tuesday’s filing will be the argument that convicting Mr. Trump would be unconstitutional, adviser Jason Miller said. The defense team also plans to argue that the impeachment proceedings were conducted inappropriately, pointing to the fact that Democrats introduced no witnesses or evidence and didn’t allow Mr. Trump to have a lawyer present.<br />“He’s basically being impeached based on speeches made by politicians in Congress,” Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal attorney, said in an interview. Mr. Giuliani isn’t serving on the former president’s defense team.<br />House Democrats have been busy honing arguments that the trial is constitutional. “The whole argument defies common sense,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the lead impeachment manager, said in an interview last month. “It seems to say that if a president decides to commit the most atrocious act of trying to foment a violent insurrection or stage a coup against the country, but does it in the last couple weeks in office, that president cannot be impeached and tried in the Senate for doing it.”</td>

      <td>Sputnik V shot achieved 91.6% efficacy against coronavirus symptoms, says paper in U.K.’s Lancet</td>
      <td>MOSCOW—Russia’s homegrown Sputnik V vaccine showed high levels of efficacy and safety in a peer-reviewed study released Tuesday, a potential boost for the Kremlin’s aim to promote the Covid-19 shot abroad and curb the pandemic at home.<br />The findings, from a preliminary analysis of a large-scale clinical trial published in the British medical journal the Lancet, demonstrated that the two-shot vaccine was 91.6% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 and offered complete protection against severe cases. There were no serious side effects, the paper said. The vaccine was also found to be similarly safe and effective in elderly people.<br />The study could be a significant milestone for Moscow in the global vaccination race, potentially offering President Vladimir Putin’s government geopolitical clout in the developing world and the chance to tap into the lucrative global vaccine market. Russia—the world’s fourth worst-hit country with nearly four million cases—has also banked on Sputnik V to avoid new costly lockdowns as authorities plan to vaccinate 60% of the domestic population by the end of the year.<br />The shot, which was approved by Russian authorities in August before undergoing large-scale clinical trials, has stirred questions in light of its fast-tracked development and lack of published trial data. So far, Sputnik V has been administered to more than two million people world-wide, including in Argentina, Serbia and Algeria, according to Russian authorities.<br />Tuesday’s results could help clear doubts surrounding the Russian shot.</td>

      <td>An almost 20% stake in Rosneft is likely to hamper the U.K. company’s efforts to appeal to environmental investors</td>
      <td>For oil  supermajor BP ,  one big obstacle stands out on the road to a greener future: its almost 20% stake in Russia’s top oil producer.<br />On Tuesday, the British company reported disappointing 2020 results, hit by lower prices, depressed demand and asset write-offs. The shares fell in early trading, having significantly underperformed peers since Chief Executive Bernard Looney announced a new strategy in September. The plan to move away from fossil fuels and into clean energy and convenience retailing has been sufficient to scare off some traditional investors, but not radical enough to attract green-minded ones.<br />The investment in Rosneft is a problem. The Russian state-backed company has a plan to develop the fragile Arctic region with 6,500 wells and 5,500 km of pipelines, as well as airports, ports, towns and highways, all working to produce and distribute 1 million tons of oil a year. The so-called Vostok project is kryptonite for the environmental investors BP is hoping to attract.<br />The company wants to sell $25 billion in assets by 2025 to pay down debt, but not the Rosneft stake. That is despite BP’s lack of control: It has two board seats and some influence, but Moscow is definitely in charge.<br />Mr. Looney said Tuesday that the Rosneft stake fits well with the new strategy. The Russian company’s production costs are about half of BP’s, and it plans to decrease its greenhouse-gas intensity. The stake is a “good financial investment,” he said, having contributed $4 billion in dividends to BP since 2013.</td>

      <td>Facebook Inc.  banned a Myanmar military television network page following Monday’s coup, the social media giant’s latest move in a country where its platform has been connected in previous years to physical violence.<br />A page for the television network has since at least early last year posted photos that publicize efforts of the nation’s military, drawing likes from more than 33,000 people, before it was removed late Monday. Facebook first removed the Myawaddy television network from its platform in 2018 as part of a crackdown on hundreds of pages, groups and accounts—some tied to Myanmar’s military—that it said had abused its services, but a page promoting the station later reappeared.<br />After The Wall Street Journal asked Monday why the Myawaddy page was operational given its earlier ban, Facebook removed it and it now displays a message saying “This Page Isn’t Available.”<br />A spokesman for the military didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the page’s removal. A separate Facebook page for announcements from the military wasn’t banned in 2018 and remains operational.<br />The head of Myanmar’s military, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, took charge of the country Monday from its civilian-run government after the military detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of her party in a Monday morning raid.</td>
