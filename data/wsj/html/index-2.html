      <td>Yield on 10-year Treasury note at its closest in weeks to psychologically significant threshold of 1%</td>
      <td>U.S. government-bond prices fell Wednesday as investors reacted to signs that U.K. and European Union officials were closing in on a new trade accord that would avoid tariffs being imposed at the start of next year.<br />In recent trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 0.960%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 0.917% Tuesday.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, initially declined early in the overnight session after President Trump criticized the roughly $900 billion coronavirus relief deal passed by Congress, raising questions about whether he might veto the legislation.<br />Yields, though, later reversed course and rose sharply in response to headlines that the U.K and EU might reach a trade deal as early as Wednesday. Absent a deal, tariffs would be applied Jan. 1 for the first time in nearly 50 years on some trade between the U.K. and the EU, causing an unwelcome economic disruption as countries are struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.<br />More directly impacted by the trade news, yields on European government bonds also climbed, with the 10-year German bond yield rising to minus 0.541% from minus 0.589% and the 10-year U.K. yield jumping to 0.285% from 0.186%. In volatile trading, the British pound was recently up around 1.2% against the dollar at $1.3521.</td>

Put simply, he’s got a lot of problems with those people. Writes Sen. Paul in the latest of his annual reports, which are becoming seasonal classics:<br />Getting down into the minute details of wasteful spending is hardly reassuring. Reports Sen. Paul:<br />The idea was to use 3D imaging technology to study how lizard joints move. Sen.

      <td>Regarding Allysia Finley’s op-ed “Now We’re Cooking With Gas. But Tomorrow?” (Dec. 17): Forbidding natural-gas connections in new buildings ensures that more, not less, natural gas will be consumed to meet the new demand for electricity. Similarly, government mandates for electric vehicles, space heating and cooking will increase the total amount of natural gas burned.<br />Natural gas consumed as a fuel to heat or cook is more than 90% efficient, while electricity produced from natural gas is at best 60% efficient. This means that boiling a pot of water on an electric stove uses 150% as much natural gas as a gas stove. This is before any consideration is given to the inefficiencies of induction heating or losses in transmission.<br />On the other hand, if all U.S. homes were required to burn natural gas for space heating and cooking, the total amount of natural gas consumed nationwide would probably decline, with the added benefit of increasing the proportion of U.S. energy sourced from renewables.

      <td>Unusual nature of this recession suggests it could lead to more rapid recovery than others</td>
      <td>Our Covid winter has begun on a grim note: Job growth is stalling, consumer spending is wilting, and a fast-spreading virus strain has raised the prospect of crippling new lockdowns.<br />Yet after this most unusual of years, there are three good reasons to think next year will be better—perhaps much better than you think. It all comes down to the unique character of both the recession and the policy response.<br />Most recessions begin when rising interest rates or stressed financial markets undercut demand for goods and services, driving up unemployment, which further crimps demand. This one began with a natural disaster, like a hurricane or earthquake, which interrupts the supply of goods and services.<br />When a disaster of that sort ends, a V-shaped recovery ensues. But this disaster, the most widespread and longest lasting in a century, isn’t over. There was a partial V-shaped recovery in the third quarter as lockdowns were lifted. But since the pandemic was never brought under control, restrictions and social distancing never ended and indeed have recently tightened.<br />Those restrictions are repressing consumer spending. IHS Markit estimates personal consumption is running 7% below its fundamental level as dictated by wages and salaries, government payments, wealth, interest rates, taxes and demographics. In the 2007-09 recession, it ran close to or above its fundamental level.</td>

      <td>College essays by Success Academy seniors tell stories of inspiration and heartbreak.</td>
      <td>As a trustee of Tufts University, I saw my share of college essays. More recently, as board chairman of Success Academy, a network of 47 K-12 charter schools in New York that enrolls 20,000 students, I had a bit of an awakening.<br />I read 29 personal statements from Success Academy’s current senior class; 28 of the 29 are students of color; 25 of the 29 will be first-generation college graduates. Virtually all took and passed multiple Advanced Placement exams. The average SAT scores were 654 on math and 611 on verbal, compared with 475 and 485 for a similar national demographic. Depending on one’s view of Success Academy—and charter schools in general—these facts suggest either an aspirational view that ZIP Codes need not determine educational excellence or a cynical view that 2,500 teachers and 20,000 kids and their families have joined a cult obsessed with producing outsize test scores.<br />Beyond the numbers, my first reaction to these essays was that they were all well-written (I even learned a new word: heteroglossia). It is fair to point out that, as a sine laude high school graduate, I am neither Strunk nor White in authoritative assessment of writing skill. Still, I have read enough bad essays to recognize a good one. Uniformly, these essays were clear, concise, grammatically correct and properly punctuated.<br />I’ve spent plenty of time with college admissions directors. They are on the whole thoughtful and committed professionals. Many also have a sardonic sense of humor, which helps when reading and evaluating thousands of essays. One Ivy League admissions director describes how insiders distill recurrent themes to a word or two. “Costa Rica” refers to the propensity of well-to-do high school juniors to embark on eco-tours of Central American countries. “Grandma” points to the lionization of elders—a noble sentiment, but as my friend wryly noted, grandma isn’t applying to college, you are. “Soup kitchen” captures the idea that two weeks’ work at the shelter doesn’t make you Mother Teresa.<br />A Success Academy scholar is as likely to live in a homeless shelter as to work in one. Gap years would more likely be devoted to caring for an autistic sibling than tending Costa Rican flora and fauna. Simple heuristics wouldn’t prove helpful in vetting a Success Academy class for college admission.</td>

      <td>Pharmaceutical companies and Trump’s Operation Warp Speed deserve the vast bulk of the credit.</td>
      <td>With the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, a light has appeared in the darkness. A hard winter lies ahead, but this pandemic will soon be over.<br />How can this be happening only 10 months after the first Covid death in the U.S., rather than the 10 years it took to develop a vaccine for measles? Nine months ago, Anthony Fauci stated unambiguously: “It will take at least a year and a half to have a vaccine we can use.” The public-health community dismissed that as a fantasy. A co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine, Paul Offit, noted: “When Dr. Fauci said 12 to 18 months, I thought that was ridiculously optimistic.” A  New York Times vaccine timeline went further, declaring: “The grim truth behind this rosy forecast is that a vaccine probably won’t arrive any time soon.”<br />Those naysayers have been proved wrong and it’s worth considering why. Let me invite the reader to answer a short quiz. When in the months ahead you are vaccinated, to whom should you be most thankful for making this possible?<br />• The initiative forwarded by the United Nations, Group of 20, World Health Organization and COVAX—an affiliate of WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations—that called for “a ‘people’s vaccine’ available and affordable for everyone, everywhere,” in the words of U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres?<br />• Foundations and donors, including the consortium led by the Gates Foundation that established the CEPI (the “alliance to finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines”) at Davos, Switzerland, in 2017?</td>

      <td>FCC sale of wireless licenses has already hit new spending highs and the total could climb after a holiday break</td>
      <td>The Federal Communications Commission’s ongoing sale of wireless licenses has fetched more than $69.8 billion after three weeks of bidding, a record sum that could alter cellphone carriers’ prospects for the next decade.<br />The auction proceeds have already topped the $44.9 billion raised in 2015 by an earlier sale of midrange cellular licenses, which U.S. cellphone carriers used at the time to enhance their 4G service. Those companies are now investing billions of dollars in the next wave of fifth-generation coverage. The 5G standard promises to speed the flow of data to phones and other wireless devices like personal computers, cars and industrial machinery.<br />The recent bids have blown past Wall Street’s highest forecasts, suggesting that several companies are fighting over the most valuable wireless rights. The 5G auction kicked off Dec. 8 and will pause for the holidays until Jan. 4, when total bids could move even higher.<br />Each bid is swathed in secrecy until the auction process ends. Analysts expect big names like  AT&T Inc.  and  Verizon Communications Inc.  to walk away with a large share of the licenses to match assets that rival T-Mobile US Inc. captured with its February takeover of Sprint.<br />“Mid-band spectrum will be where 5G lives,” said Walt Piecyk, a telecom analyst for research firm LightShed Partners. He added that T-Mobile’s merger with Sprint “clearly put pressure on Verizon and AT&T” to match their rival’s war chest.</td>

Gift card sales jumped 48% last weekend, compared with earlier in the week, as deadlines for free shipping with guaranteed Christmas delivery expired, according to Rise.ai, which manages electronic gift card programs for more than 5,000 brands, including Allbirds and Milk Bar.<br />Tim Maynard has already spent nearly $300 on gift cards this year at retailers ranging from  Amazon.com Inc.  to  Target Corp.  to  Home Depot Inc.  In past years, the 32-year-old financial analyst said he shied away from giving the cards because they felt impersonal.<br />“It was sort of a last resort this year,” said the St. Clair, Mo., resident. “Not having the ability to get in stores and see things makes it hard to buy gifts.”</td>

      <td>Apple Inc.  is booting thousands of videogame apps from its platform in China as the government clamps down harder on such content, illustrating the tech giant’s vulnerability to state pressure on its business.<br />The iPhone maker this month warned Chinese developers that a new wave of paid gaming apps are at risk of removal from its app store, according to a memo viewed by The Wall Street Journal, after the company removed thousands of such apps earlier this year.<br />The Chinese government four years ago began requiring videogames to be licensed before being released, but developers were able to skirt the requirement in Apple’s app store. Apple hasn’t said why the loophole existed or why the company began closing it this year. Foreign software developers lament the change, citing difficulty securing approval in China for their games.<br />The app-store purge comes as China has stepped up efforts to police its internet, tightening content controls and censorship, including a demand that Tripadvisor and more than 100 other apps be removed from the Apple store in the country. The Cyberspace Administration of China called the apps illegal without spelling out the offenses Tripadvisor or the other apps, most of which are from Chinese developers, had committed. Tripadvisor declined to comment.<br />The Cyberspace Administration of China, which regulates cybersecurity, and the National Radio and Television Administration, which approves videogames, didn’t respond to requests for comment.</td>

      <td>Agribusiness giants, startups jockey to pay farmers for capturing greenhouse gases in fields; environmental groups question impact</td>
      <td>U.S. farmers make their living raising crops from the soil each year. Now, some are getting paid for putting something back into their fields: carbon.<br />Big agriculture companies including  Bayer AG ,  Nutrien Ltd.  and Cargill Inc. are jockeying with startups to encourage crop producers to adopt climate-friendly practices and develop farming-driven carbon markets. Those efforts would let retailers, food makers and other companies offset their greenhouse gas emissions by paying farmers for their fields’ capacity to withdraw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and trap it in the soil.<br />The concept envisions the U.S. Midwest’s swatches of cropland doing double duty as a vast carbon sink. Plants’ process of photosynthesis withdraws carbon dioxide from the air, combines it with water and sunlight to produce energy, and ultimately embeds carbon in dirt through roots, while releasing oxygen back into the atmosphere. Soil, if left undisturbed, can retain the converted carbon for years.<br />Agricultural companies, long criticized as environmental villains, say that paying farmers to maximize those natural processes can put the scale of modern farming behind a potential climate solution. Farmers, following half a decade of lean crop prices, are contemplating a possible new source of income that is less dependent on weather and agricultural commodity markets. The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that the agriculture sector accounts for 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.<br />President-elect Joe Biden’s administration also plans to pursue the concept. Mr. Biden said this month that under his administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will direct federal conservation payments to farmers who use their fields to capture more carbon.</td>

      <td>Consumer spending and incomes could take hit, as business restrictions aim to curb surge of infections</td>
      <td>The U.S. economy has entered an odd sort of limbo—slowing, as it ends an unusually rough year, but with a possibly stronger recovery looming ahead.<br />The latest economic readings, due out Wednesday, are expected to show that U.S. households cut spending in November, which would be the first drop since April, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The Commerce Department report is also projected to show a drop in household income last month, as the effects of federal-aid programs earlier this year fade. A separate report by the Labor Department is expected to show another rise in weekly jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs.<br />Businesses across the U.S. have been forced to shut or scale back operations in recent weeks, as states and cities try to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Economic growth appears to have slowed this winter as a result.<br />Consumer spending—the linchpin of growth in the world’s largest economy, representing more than two-thirds of demand here—has grown more slowly in recent months and could remain weak for the short term.<br />Next year’s economic outlook is brighter. Congress on Monday passed a roughly $900 billion pandemic-relief package that includes a new round of $600 stimulus checks for most individuals and enhanced unemployment benefits. Authorities this month began giving some essential workers and other vulnerable Americans the vaccine against the virus, the start of a monthslong process that could eventually lead the economy to more fully reopen. Some economists think gross domestic product could grow by a robust 5% or more next year.</td>

      <td>Memo advised a co-owner to keep assets overseas to protect against litigation</td>
      <td>In July 2007, a few months after Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty to federal charges of misleading the public about the addictive risks of OxyContin, a confidential memo warned one of the company’s owners that its assets are best protected overseas.<br />The family-owned company faced “uncapped liabilities” and had to protect itself from the risk of a wave of lawsuits akin to the decadeslong asbestos litigation, said the memo, written by Peter Boer, then an adviser to Jonathan Sackler, the Purdue co-owner and a board member.<br />“For the family, it may be that overseas assets with limited transparency and jurisdictional shielding from U.S. judgments will be less attractive to litigants than domestic assets,” Mr. Boer wrote in the memo to Mr. Sackler, analyzing a possible sale of Purdue.<br />The memo by Mr. Boer, who joined Purdue’s board in 2008 and remains a director, is among hundreds of emails and other corporate documents recently unsealed in Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy case at the request of The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations represented by attorneys at the nonprofit Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.<br />A committee of Purdue creditors investigating the Sacklers says the records supply evidence for their probe into whether Sackler family members unlawfully moved $10.3 billion in profits out of the company from 2008 to 2017 to thwart future judgments, an allegation the Sacklers deny. Purdue is trying to resolve those lawsuits through bankruptcy.</td>

In return, the Justice Department agreed to drop an objection it filed in the Westmoreland case alleging McKinsey’s disclosures were legally insufficient.<br />The settlement is the latest in several multimillion-dollar deals in recent years tied to questions about McKinsey’s disclosure practices. Bankruptcy advisers legally are required to be disinterested and to disclose connections that could give rise to a conflict of interest.<br />“It is my hope that McKinsey management is able to implement changes that make a difference,” said Judge David Jones of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, who oversaw the Westmoreland case and related disclosure litigation.</td>

But the Apple CEO, he said, “refused to take the meeting.”<br />Mr. Musk revealed the latest detail as he questioned the seriousness of Apple’s plans to bring out an electric car of its own, amid a new report the company is pushing for 2024 production.<br />On Twitter, Mr. Musk called the report “strange, if true.”<br />Tesla has built a brand for itself as a Silicon Valley auto maker offering high-tech cars with promises of fully self-driving technology on the near horizon. The specter of a driverless, electric car made by tech giant Apple could prove the kind of fierce competition that traditional auto makers, such as General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG, have yet to muster.</td>

Joe Biden called it a mere “down payment” and Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it is “a first step.” They want bailouts for the states in particular, even as the latest Census report shows states are doing far better than they claim.<br />States are also doing very well in this latest Covid bill. Start with the $26 billion for transit agencies, airports and shovel-ready public works. This will help New York’s transit and port authorities reduce their financial holes.<br />There’s also $22 billion for the states for Covid testing and contact tracing, though insurers and the feds cover the cost of tests. States will use it for more budget backfill. The Los Angeles Times reported last month that 25 LA County firefighters had made more than $100,000 on average in overtime by ferrying test supplies, most of which was reimbursed by federal Cares Act funds.<br />Education will get a whopping $82 billion, about $54 billion of which will go to K-12 schools though many are closed and employ fewer staff. That’s about as much as the federal government spends on K-12 in a normal year. The bill also provides $3.2 billion for broadband for low-income families, so public schools don’t have to pay for that.<br />States will also benefit from the federal enhanced $300 weekly unemployment benefits, which are taxable income in most states.  The jobless benefit sweetener will especially help states with higher unemployment such as New Jersey (10.2%), Hawaii (10.1%), New York (8.4%), Connecticut (8.2%) and California (8.2%).</td>

      <td>How bloody-minded will Democrats be with their precariously thin House majority? We’re about to find out as Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s caucus considers an election challenge from Iowa’s 2nd Congressional district.<br />On Nov. 30, Iowa certified Republican candidate Mariannette Miller-Meeks the winner of the district, which extends southeast of Des Moines and is currently held by a Democrat. The margin was six votes.<br />On Tuesday Democrat Rita Hart submitted a brief asking the House of Representatives to overturn that outcome. Authored by Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias, it says counting 22 mostly absentee ballots would give Ms. Hart a nine-vote lead. The brief asks the House to order another recount and use its constitutional authority to seat Ms. Hart instead.<br />Among the reasons the ballots were wrongly excluded, the brief says, are signature placement, envelope seal and timeliness. Ms. Miller-Meeks’s campaign must file a response, which could raise other ballot disputes, within 30 days. Her campaign said in a statement: “Congresswoman-elect Mariannette Miller-Meeks won the vote on election night, won the 24-county audit and official canvas, won the 24-county recount, and was unanimously certified by the State of Iowa as the winner of the election by a bipartisan council.”<br />One political vulnerability for the Hart campaign is that it did not exhaust its Iowa court challenges before asking the House to intervene. The campaign said there wasn’t time for judicial relief in the one-week window between certification and the Dec. 8 deadline for a five-member state “contest court” ruling. But if only 22 ballots are at issue, the complaint could have been presented to Iowa judges.</td>

      <td>Gen. Perna has presided over vaccine delivery that is a great success.</td>
      <td>‘I failed, nobody else failed.” You don’t hear that often, or ever, from a government official. But that’s what Operation Warp Speed logistics chief Gen. Gustave Perna said Saturday by way of apologizing to states for shipping fewer  Pfizer  Covid vaccine doses than expected. Kudos to Gen. Perna—and all the more so since overall the vaccine rollout is a historic success.<br />Close collaboration between government and private industry has made a vaccine available in record time and now is proving essential to distribution logistics. The military has been charged with coordinating distribution with states and private companies across a long supply chain including drug makers, airlines, freight companies, pharmacies, hospitals and nursing homes.<br />All of this involves meticulous planning, which has been in the works since early spring. Operation Warp Speed accelerated vaccine development by removing financial risk for drug makers and helping them line up facilities to manufacture vaccine candidates and sites to conduct trials. It has also accelerated and facilitated distribution.<br />Drug makers usually wait until their vaccines are approved before buying raw materials and establishing manufacturing lines and supply chains. Operation Warp Speed worked with and provided funding for drug makers to do all of this months ahead of time. So once vaccines are approved, shipments can begin immediately.<br />Pfizer has done most of the logistical groundwork for its vaccine, which is especially tricky because it must be transported and stored at ultra-cold temperatures. There are multiple steps from manufacturing to inoculation including final-assembly and storage sites. Pfizer has planned dozens of cargo flights and hundreds of truck trips every day.</td>

      <td>A new rule will help traders access vital price information.</td>
      <td>A fight over the data fees that trading firms pay stock exchanges has grown tense, and trading firms have been calling for back up. The Securities and Exchange Commission has had mixed success lately in its search for the best ways to lower barriers for traders. But its rule on data infrastructure will expand access to key trading information while remaining within its authority.<br />Finalized this month, the rule mandates that exchanges such as Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange publish more detailed live trading data on their public data feeds. These feeds report last-sale quotations for each listed stock, but they omit other data that allow traders to gauge a stock’s momentum, such as recent offers made above and below the current sale price. Public feeds also lag behind the pace of trading, making it hard for traders who track prices to execute profitably in today’s high-speed market.<br />Trading firms and the SEC say the shoddiness of public data is part of the exchanges’ plan. To access quick, quality stock info, firms must subscribe to any of the increasing number of premium feeds that NYSE, Nasdaq and the  Chicago Board Options Exchange  now offer. The SEC found that, from 2010 to 2018, traders’ data fees increased anywhere from 967% to 2,916% depending on their business model. A typical midsize firm might now pay $3 million annually for its live stock price data, before additional transaction fees.<br />In addition to beefing up the public feeds, the new rule will expand the range of data that exchanges must send to other publishers of stock price info. These “competing consolidators” sell analysis of stock fluctuations to traders, often for lower fees than the exchanges charge for their premium feeds. The SEC will also require exchanges to publish sale prices for smaller lots of certain high-price stocks, providing a more useful guide for traders who deal in small volumes.<br />The new rule comes six months after the SEC took a pair of losses in previous attempts to regulate the exchanges. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in June struck down the agency’s plan to study the market by temporarily adjusting certain exchange fees and rebates. The court also blocked the SEC’s move to roll back exchanges’ fee increases once they’re already in place.</td>

Miguel Cardona, Connecticut’s education commissioner, pressed to get children back in school while teachers unions wanted them closed. Rather than follow the “college or bust” monomania, he has urged equal support for children “who need hands-on experiences, who want to build things, who want to manufacture.”<br />Dacia Toll, CEO of the Achievement First charter-school network that operates in Connecticut, says of Mr. Cardona: “I haven’t found him to be driven by ideology and politics. He is more focused on making sure every kid gets an excellent education than the type of school they go to.”<br />Let’s hope he can maintain that evenhandedness, taste for excellence, and openness to reform. For if Mr. Cardona ends up running the Education Department, he will face heavy pressure to focus less on children and more on what is politically expedient. Advocates surrounding him will demand lots more money for the status quo and an end to disruption of existing K-12 systems.<br />If a Secretary Cardona does choose to resist, he’ll have evidence on his side. People who demand more spending on social programs love to chatter about “evidence based” policy making. Follow the science! goes the familiar cry. Alas, this sloganeering is often lip service.<br />One sad reality about “evidence-based social policy” is that astonishingly few interventions show any proof that they work. Beginning in 2001, some very smart economists and social scientists worked for more than a decade to build the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy. These careful investigators reviewed many hundreds of academic assessments, and commissioned some original ones of their own. In the end, they were able to identify only 12 domestic programs that clearly helped the population they were aimed at. Another 16 programs showed partial signs of effectiveness, and 31 more had outcomes that were somewhat encouraging though indefinite. That was it. After decades of interventions consuming billions of dollars, a grand total of 59 programs could demonstrate any positive effect.</td>

      <td>Section 230 has its flaws, but those are nothing compared with what Big Brother would bring.</td>
      <td>If you had told me 24 years ago that the internet pornography law I was working on would be the main obstacle to defense spending in 2020, I would have called you crazy. Yet for the past several weeks President Trump has repeatedly warned that he will veto the $740 billion defense appropriation bill if Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act isn’t repealed.<br />The congressional committee that drafted the 1996 act’s final language knew that Section 230 was a critical law at the dawn of the internet, and we passed it for a specific reason: to protect the internet’s role as a free marketplace of ideas. What went wrong? We succeeded too well.<br />In recent years, Section 230 has become a political punching bag, with some saying it allows big tech companies to censor political views, and others saying it enables the spread of disinformation. Nearly a quarter century ago, we couldn’t have anticipated today’s internet, where one private company,  Facebook ,  controls most of the public forums that Americans use to express their views, and another, Google, controls most of the information Americans receive when they search the internet.<br />We need to re-evaluate Section 230 in light of today’s very different internet. But there’s one thing we shouldn’t re-evaluate: the provision’s role in supporting and nurturing an open and free marketplace of ideas. Every election cycle, and almost every news cycle, reminds us how difficult it is to defend the free-speech rights of those with whom we disagree. Our tradition of free expression is threatened every day, and we must remain vigilant about preserving it.<br />Simply repealing Section 230 is the worst possible solution. If website owners are held liable for everything that appears on their platforms, they will have to create systems for reviewing and editing all posted content before it goes up. This is an impossible task. At best it would create an environment that allows only the most limited and inoffensive speech. At worst it would force operators to shut down many social-media sites and drastically limit the ability of private citizens to express views online. We would end up with a Kafkaesque process governed by tort lawyers, political correctness and hidden agendas. This isn’t the right solution for a free society.</td>

      <td>A policy aimed at conspiracy theories could hit scientific brainstorming.</td>
      <td>Facebook has announced a policy to “remove false claims that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips, or anything else that isn’t on the official vaccine ingredient list.” This seems reasonable, until you think through the details.<br />One difficulty is that banning discussion is a terrible way to counter a conspiracy theory; the censorship is seen as further evidence of a conspiracy. Better to acknowledge the facts and test the theory’s plausibility. Radio-frequency identification chips can be as narrow as 0.15 millimeter, small enough to fit through the 25-gauge needle used for vaccinations. But objects that size can be seen with the naked eye. Thousands of medical personnel have administered the vaccines, and none have reported little black objects floating in the bottles. Further, how could one microchip per person be extracted from a single bottle containing multiple doses? And why would anyone bother to tag people now that we all carry cellphones with unique identifiers?<br />The notion that there are microchips in vaccines is a ridiculous conspiracy theory, best dealt with by facts, science, logic and ridicule, not censorship. But Facebook’s policy of restricting discussion to substances on the “official vaccine ingredient list” also hinders serious discussion of what is causing the rare allergic reactions to the  Pfizer  vaccine.<br />That inquiry has centered on one of the official ingredients, polyethylene glycol, which is very rarely an allergen. We should also consider the possibility of trace amounts of other allergens accompanying the officially listed ingredients. To assess this, I showed the ingredient list to a drug-formulation scientist, Chris Moreton. He responded that some of the lipid ingredients are typically derived from plants such as beans, and traces of proteins from these plants should be considered as potential causes of the allergic reactions. That is a forbidden thought on Facebook because bean protein isn’t on the official vaccine ingredients list.<br />Mr. Moreton and I are scientists, and Facebook’s policies would suppress our brainstorming. There are ways of dealing with such controversies without censorship. In science, we have journals, seminars and conferences in which all sorts of hypotheses are floated and assessed. We have a decentralized process by which good ideas can rise to the top.</td>

      <td>Justice Department accuses retail giant of ignoring warnings from its own pharmacists; complaint follows company’s suit to fight allegations pre-emptively</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Trump administration sued  Walmart Inc.  Tuesday, accusing the retail giant of helping to fuel the nation’s opioid crisis by inadequately screening for questionable prescriptions despite repeated warnings from its own pharmacists.<br />The Justice Department’s lawsuit claims Walmart sought to boost profits by understaffing its pharmacies and pressuring employees to fill prescriptions quickly. That made it difficult for pharmacists to reject invalid prescriptions, enabling widespread drug abuse nationwide, the suit alleges.<br />Walmart responded in a public filing Tuesday, saying the lawsuit “invents a legal theory that unlawfully forces pharmacists to come between patients and their doctors, and is riddled with factual inaccuracies and cherry-picked documents taken out of context.”<br />“Blaming pharmacists for not second-guessing the very doctors [the Drug Enforcement Administration] approved to prescribe opioids is a transparent attempt to shift blame from DEA’s well-documented failures in keeping bad doctors from prescribing opioids in the first place,” Walmart said, adding that it “always empowered our pharmacists to refuse to fill problematic opioids prescriptions, and they refused to fill hundreds of thousands of such prescriptions.”<br />The country’s largest retailer by revenue, Walmart has been expecting this complaint and sued the federal government in October to fight the allegations pre-emptively. That suit accuses the Justice Department and DEA of attempting to scapegoat the company for what it says are the federal government’s own regulatory and enforcement shortcomings.</td>

      <td>Government relief covers carriers’ payrolls through March, but rebound in air travel remains uncertain</td>
      <td>Airlines are preparing to call back tens of thousands of workers they let go in October now that Congress has approved government assistance to cover carriers’ payroll through the end of March. The question is how long employees will be able to keep their jobs.<br />The $900 billion relief package for households and businesses battered by the coronavirus pandemic includes $15 billion for airlines to pay all their workers. Carriers are hoping—for the second time—that the government assistance will serve as a bridge through a rocky period.<br />Many travel executives believe there is pent-up demand for travel that could be unleashed next summer. If they are right, airlines will need as many pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, and baggage handlers as they can get in order to keep up. Airlines furloughed over 32,000 workers in October when the government aid they received last spring ran out.<br />But a new strain of coronavirus in the United Kingdom has illustrated how quickly prospects for a recovery in travel could change. The strain has prompted a wave of travel restrictions in Europe and elsewhere, raising fresh questions about when borders will reopen and when people will be comfortable traveling again.<br />The funding bill, which President Trump is expected to sign, covers airline employees’ wages and benefits retroactively from Dec. 1 through the end of March, and bars airlines from furloughing or laying people off again during that period.</td>

      <td>Accusations by Texas and nine other states give ground to publishers’ frustrations that the digital-ad economy is rigged</td>
      <td>For more than a decade, Google assured publishers its online advertising tools were designed to help them make more money. Many were skeptical.<br />Last week, an antitrust lawsuit by Texas and nine other states against Google gave publishers’ frustrations a legal voice, alleging that the tech giant runs a digital advertising monopoly and rigs the market in its favor.<br />“One of the messages news publishers always get is, ‘Stop complaining. Google just has better ad products,’” said David Chavern, the president of the News Media Alliance, a news-publisher trade group. The suit showed “they also controlled everything about the market, and that has had really bad and profound effects on publishers,” he said.<br />Several publishers cooperated with the states to build a case, people familiar with the situation said, and much of the suit lines up with the complaints publishers have made about Google for several years.<br />Publishing executives say they were surprised by the volume of internal Google documentation included in the suit. Communications between Google employees, much of it redacted, suggest the employees were aware Google advertising tools didn’t always help publisher clients make more money than other ad tools, according to the suit.</td>
