      <td>Chuck Yeager, a folksy, hard-living daredevil who was the first aviator to break the sound barrier and became a symbol of bravery for generations of test pilots, astronauts and average Americans, died Monday at the age of 97.<br />The announcement, posted on his official  Twitter  account by his wife, Victoria, didn’t provide any details. Writing that he died around 9 p.m. Eastern time, she said: “An incredible life well lived, America’s greatest Pilot, & a legacy of strength, adventure, & patriotism will be remembered forever.”<br />Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who became friends with Gen. Yeager, called him a native son who “was larger than life and an inspiration for generations of Americans.”<br />His death was also confirmed by the Associated Press.<br />A West Virginia native whose maverick streak didn’t keep him from becoming an Air Force general, Gen. Yeager personified the thrill-seeking fraternity of flyboys that moved the U.S. into the jet age after World War II and later vaulted it toward space exploration.</td>

These included “reduction in the risk of confirmed Covid-19 occurring at least seven days after Dose 2.” The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses for full protection.<br />In addition, the FDA said another benefit was reduction in the risk of confirmed Covid-19 after the first dose and before the second dose. Another clear benefit, the agency said, was “reduction in the risk of confirmed severe Covid-19 any time after dose 1.”<br />The reference to reduction in confirmed severe disease was important, as early critics of some of the vaccine trials were concerned that only mild to moderate disease was prevented.</td>

      <td>Advancing Women Artists was founded by the late pioneering philanthropist known as ‘Indiana Jane’; the closure comes as a surprise</td>
      <td>FLORENCE—Advancing Women Artists, the nonprofit devoted to rescuing the forgotten works of female artists and founded by the late pioneering philanthropist Jane Fortune, is folding. A message sent to AWA members on Dec. 1 and posted to its website said: “In June 2021, our much-loved organization will officially close its doors.”<br />Since its foundation in 2009, AWA has identified hundreds of works created by Italian women artists between the 16th and 20th centuries and financed the restoration of 70. Last year, the organization attracted world-wide attention with the unveiling of perhaps the most ambitious work known to have been painted by a woman during the Italian Renaissance: Plautilla Nelli’s Last Supper.<br />Many of the canvasses located by AWA were found, caked with grime, in dusty museum storerooms and dank Tuscan churches. The organization’s work earned Ms. Fortune the nickname in Italy of “Indiana Jane”—an allusion both to her native state and the intrepid fictional treasure hunter, Indiana Jones.<br />Ironically, the announcement of AWA’s closure has come at a time of unprecedented interest in women’s art. Twentieth century female artists have achieved record prices in the sale rooms; a work by the British painter Jenny Saville went under the hammer in 2018 for more than $10 million, the highest amount ever paid for a painting by a woman. Last February, Columbia University art historian Michael Cole published a substantial monograph on Sofonisba Anguissola, a 16th century Italian artist. And recently, the National Gallery in London inaugurated a major exhibition devoted to Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi.<br />Last week’s announcement from AWA, which gave no reason for its closure, came as a surprise to many supporters of the organization. The organization’s director, Linda Falcone, said AWA lacked the financial resources to continue with its work and had been unable to find a benefactor to succeed Ms. Fortune, who died in 2018.</td>

      <td>Fitness+, Apple’s new subscription service for on-demand workouts, arrives next week with 21 trainers across 10 disciplines.</td>
      <td>The fact that Apple’s six-country launch of a new connected workout platform, Fitness+, which arrives in the Apple store next week, is happening during a surge in a global pandemic that carved out a new market for home fitness is, Apple insists, pure coincidence (“Siri, what’s a synonym for providential?”)<br />“It does feel like people might think we built Fitness+ because of Covid,” Jay Blahnik, Apple’s senior director of fitness technologies, tells me via a video call from the company’s fitness studio in Los Angeles. “But we’ve been working on it for a very, very long time.”<br />From the Apple Watch’s launch, more than five years ago, Blahnik says “fitness has been a really big part of [its] story.” With the launch of Fitness+, however, Apple aims to create a new ecosystem for the watch: a subscription-based, on-demand virtual-fitness studio, with an initial 21-person team of trainers (recruited after an intensive search, in which Apple says “no gym was too gritty for us to go into”), covering 10 disciplines—from high-intensity interval training to dance workouts to rowing to “mindful cooldowns”—offering a fresh slate of workouts, of varying lengths, every week (all set to the beat of Apple Music).<br />Apple doesn’t make fitness equipment—at least not yet—but the watch, arguably, is fitness equipment. Workouts and activity tracking are, Apple says, among the device’s most popular features. From the get-go, the watch had been making inroads into wearers’ wellness routines, not simply by keeping track of their daily movements but by encouraging them to “close your rings,” or complete three color-coded, adjustable-difficulty tasks: “Stand,” for spending at least a minute moving around every hour for 12 hours; “Move,” for burning a certain number of active calories; and “Exercise,” for doing at least 30 minutes of an activity as or more strenuous than brisk walking. It also offers gentle exhortations to pause for deep-breathing exercises.<br />In its fitness lab, the company has been closely tracking more than a hundred thousand hours of activity—across a range of workouts—all with the goal of improving the watch’s accuracy at discerning, say, what stroke you are employing as you swim laps.</td>

CoStar already owns Apartments.com which, like RentPath, is a big player in the online market for apartment listings.<br />“The proposed acquisition is likely to lead to anticompetitive effects,” states the Commission complaint.<br />In a written statement responding to the FTC, CoStar Chief Executive Andrew Florance questioned whether RentPath was still a major market force, given that it is operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. RentPath’s owners, private-equity firms TPG Capital and Providence Equity, took the company into bankruptcy at the same time the proposed sale to CoStar was announced.<br />“We strongly disagree that a RentPath in bankruptcy has any competitive significance,” Mr. Florance said. “We will continue to evaluate the case.”</td>

      <td>Getting boys to engage in virtual instruction doesn’t have to be a battle. Experts offer tips on how to make virtual school more bearable.</td>
      <td>We’re nine months into the pandemic and remote school is wearing on students. Boys, who are at greater risk of falling behind academically than girls, are having an especially tough time with all the hours spent behind screens. The challenges of staying focused and motivated in remote school carry even higher stakes for adolescent and teenage boys, who face more academic pressure than younger ones.<br />I reached out to child psychologists and education experts to find out how parents can help their sons—and daughters—remain focused and motivated in virtual school. They all said the first step is for parents to examine their own expectations and reactions to their children’s struggles. Here are some key pieces of advice:<br />“What you need to do as a parent is try to stay away from your own catastrophic thinking and use your foremost consultant, which is your child himself,” said Michael Thompson, a child psychologist and author of “Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys.” He added, “No one knows more about what he likes and what he hates about school than he does.”<br />How do you elicit meaningful feedback from an adolescent or teenager who responds with one-word answers? It’s all about how you ask the question. Dr. Thompson suggests saying something like, “I see you’re struggling with math and English. How can I help you with that?”<br />Experts caution parents against being accusatory. If a teacher has alerted you to missing assignments, you can say to your child, “I heard you’re having a hard time turning things in. What’s happening?” suggests Jeffrey Selman, vice president of clinical services at First Children Services, a behavioral health and special-education services provider for children in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</td>

A number of recent Dutch narcotics raids have snagged Mexican nationals, including ones linked to the violent Jalisco New Generation Cartel, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.<br />Mexican cartels, which dominate drug trafficking in North America, are drawn to the Netherlands because it is a global trade nexus with sea and rail links to Asia that has long been Europe’s top manufacturer of synthetic drugs.<br />Piggybacking legitimate commercial channels, Mexican cartels are combining sophistication with ruthlessness to expand their reach world-wide. Their multinational drive is enabled by the advent over recent decades of highly potent synthetic drugs that don’t rely on crops or farmers and can be manufactured in compact facilities almost anywhere. Production experts instant-message instructions to overseas workers and hop the globe like factory troubleshooters in any industry.<br />With the U.S. drug market saturated and methamphetamine labs in Mexico already supersize, cartels that murder for market share see Europe as a new hub. The cartels are “like global corporations,” said DEA Regional Director for Europe Daniel Dodds. “If they can expand and broaden their customer base, they will.”</td>

In contrast, triple-A coupon rates dipped to 4.09%. Some Chinese bonds trade on exchanges while others trade in the so-called interbank market.<br />Overall, Chinese companies, including financial ones, issued the equivalent of $2.3 trillion in yuan-denominated bonds in the year through Dec. 8, already 33% more than 2019’s total, according to Wind. More than a third of the total was made up of commercial paper, short-term debt that comes due in less than a year.<br />Chang Li, a Beijing-based director at S&P Global Ratings, said borrowing costs have risen in particular for companies in northeastern and western provinces where local governments have limited financial resources. Costs have also risen in industries burdened by overcapacity, he said. That would likely include companies specializing in areas such as mining, chemical production and heavy industry.</td>

      <td>Phill Kline says he has filed so many legal challenges to the presidential-election results that he can’t keep track.<br />“It’s hard for me to keep up, honestly,” said Mr. Kline, a former Republican attorney general of Kansas who runs the Amistad Project, an election-focused offshoot of the Thomas More Society, a conservative legal group in Chicago best-known for antiabortion and religious-rights casework.<br />The Amistad Project is among a small but committed band of pro-Trump plaintiffs that have targeted battleground states and swelled the dockets with lawsuits aimed at invalidating President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. As the Trump campaign pursues a handful of long-shot lawsuits in two states, outside activists have at least a half-dozen cases pending before state and federal benches.<br />None have been successful, but they have fed into suspicions among Republicans that the election wasn’t run fairly. The affidavits attached to the lawsuits and video evidence purporting to show mishandling of ballots have gone viral among conservatives and provided fuel for critics of expanded absentee voting.<br />State election officials and U.S. Attorney General William Barr have said they have found no evidence of fraud widespread enough to tip the election. Federal cybersecurity officials have called the election the most secure ever conducted. In Georgia, where the viral videos emerged, state investigators have said the recordings show normal operations, with observers watching legal ballots get counted.</td>

      <td>Requirement to prove immunity raises practical and ethical issues: Should vaccinated people have greater freedom?</td>
      <td>As the West’s first authorized Covid-19 shots were administered in the U.K., an old ethical question in public health is gaining new relevance: Is there a case for issuing proof of immunity to people who have been inoculated?<br />The idea is that individuals could stop wearing masks and following social-distancing rules if they can prove they have been inoculated and so aren’t a risk to others. Restaurants, theaters and offices could reopen with confidence by admitting those certified as vaccinated, and international travel could resume. As the vaccinated population increases, normal life could gradually resume.<br />Scientists and public-health experts caution, though, that it is too soon to know whether the vaccines being raced into production will confer true and lasting immunity to infection. Nor is it clear if they will be as effective at preventing transmission as they were at reducing the severity of illness in trials. Such proposals raise ethical and political considerations, too, about whether it is wise or just to divide citizens into new categories based on their vaccination status.<br />This debate over the pros and cons of so-called immunity passports as a tool to combat the pandemic has been rekindled by the U.K.’s decision last week, the first by a Western country, to authorize the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine. Elderly citizens and health-care workers started receiving a shot developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and Germany’s BioNTech SE on Tuesday.<br />The Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency are evaluating the vaccine as well as several others and, if cleared, vaccinations in the U.S. and the European Union could begin late this year or early in 2021, health officials in both jurisdictions say.</td>

      <td>Greek banks, among Europe’s weakest, are getting rid of their bad loans at a healthy clip.<br />In spring, the pandemic interrupted plans among the country’s banks to shed loans still festering from the eurozone crisis a decade ago. But stimulus from central banks and governments globally has sent fresh cash into funds that buy non-performing loans, reinvigorating the efforts.<br />“Many of the investors are in the process of fund raising or have raised additional funds for what they see as a wave of opportunity,” said Alok Gahrotra, a partner in the portfolio lead advisory team at Deloitte that advises NPL buyers and sellers. “There’s a lot of dry powder to deploy.”<br />In late November,  Alpha Bank ,  one of Greece’s  four dominant lenders, said it was in the final stages of selling a €10.8 billion gross loan portfolio—the equivalent of $12 billion—along with its loan-servicing unit. The preferred bidder is U.S. investment firm Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP, which beat out Pacific Investment Management Co. and others for what would be the largest-ever NPL sale in the country. Two more big banks,  National Bank of Greece  and  Piraeus Bank ,  each aim to sell around €7 billion in loans next year.<br />The three transactions will tap a new state-supported securitization program called Hercules, which was first used by Eurobank SA in June to dispose of €7.5 billion gross loans, “paving the way for its peers,” said Eurobank chief executive Fokion Karavias.</td>

      <td>Shares in one of China’s top telemedicine providers surged on their Hong Kong debut Tuesday, reflecting how Chinese technology companies have reinvigorated the city’s stock market.<br />The $3.5 billion initial public offering by JD Health International Inc. is Hong Kong’s largest this year. It has come as the city closes out its best year for listing activity in a decade—thanks both to IPOs and to secondary listings of companies whose stock already trades on other exchanges, such as JD Health’s parent, the e-commerce group  JD.com Inc.<br />JD Health stock closed 56% higher at 110 Hong Kong dollars a share, the equivalent of $14.19, giving the company a market value of about $44 billion, after earlier rising as much as 76%. Rival Alibaba Health Information Technology Ltd., which is controlled by internet giant  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , has a market value of about $41 billion.<br />Individual investors placed orders for more than 420 times the stock offered to them, while institutional buyers sought more than 31 times the shares they were offered, JD Health said. The company operates China’s largest online retail pharmacy, as well as providing other health-care services.<br />Including JD Health, more than 130 companies have raised nearly $47 billion through IPOs and secondary listings in Hong Kong this year, according to Refinitiv. That is the highest total since 2010, even though Ant Group Co.’s blockbuster IPO was derailed in November. Parent company JD.com’s own secondary listing in June raised nearly $4.5 billion, making it the city’s biggest listing this year.</td>

      <td>The continued rise of real-estate investment left China with the largest increase in global household debt in the first half of the year, which will drag on its economic potential in years to come</td>
      <td>China’s household debt ballooned in the first half of the year, rising by about $380 billion, according to new Bank for International Settlements data. That increase was almost four times as large as the second-place U.S. And it compounds one of China’s biggest economic vulnerabilities.<br />It has been widely reported that China’s industrial production and exports have helped to power its recovery this year. But the other leg of the recovery is the continued rapid rise of real-estate investment, which is set to outstrip GDP growth again in 2020, as it has in 16 of the past 17 years.<br />Interest rates this year fell sharply in most countries, but the People’s Bank of China has resisted this trend. That means that whereas borrowers in the U.S. were at least able to refinance real-estate loans, Chinese borrowers are left with largely unchanged debt-servicing costs.<br />The reluctance to cut rates reflects the government’s concerns about previous rounds of let-it-rip credit growth, which have left the housing market displaying telltale signs of rampant speculation.<br />Hundreds of millions of units, equivalent to about a fifth of the urban housing stock, are estimated to be vacant. The rental market is still underdeveloped, but where it does exist, yields are typically well below those offered by government bonds. Banks that once lent primarily to industry have recorded ever-growing mortgage books. That already appears to be eating into China’s economic potential, as funding is redirected toward real estate and away from more productive uses.</td>

The president garnered more than 74 million votes in his re-election bid, the second highest in history. President-elect Joe Biden received nearly 81 million votes, a record.<br />“They wanted a political leader in the president who would stand up for America, who would express a proud, deep and abiding love for our country, and who would not give in to the radical, politically correct liberals,” he said.<br />Mr. Cotton, who was speaking at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit, provided a contrast to other Republicans who agreed that Mr. Trump’s coalition had proved durable but said that Mr. Trump’s popularity was an indicator of the appeal of his rhetoric and not his policies.<br />“Let’s not kid ourselves,” said William Kristol, who served as chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle during the George H.W. Bush administration from 1989 to 1993. “The demagoguery was what people liked.”</td>

Re-entering that agreement, which would mean lifting sanctions worth billions of dollars to Tehran, would lay the groundwork for a “follow-on negotiation” on broader issues, he said.<br />Mr. Sullivan, who hasn’t spoken publicly much since being named national security adviser, spoke to the CEO Council on Iran and a range of other national security and foreign-policy issues likely to confront the Biden administration.  He discussed reforming international institutions and strengthening ties with allies while confronting adversaries and global competitors like China.

Medical staff who treated the now 30-year-old Australian considered the accident to be unusual, but held back from reporting it to police because Tarrant wasn’t behaving aggressively and didn’t appear suicidal.<br />It was just one of several missed opportunities to intercept Tarrant before he gunned down the worshipers on March 15, 2019, that were outlined in an official inquiry into the massacre. The investigation also highlighted police failings in granting Tarrant a firearms license and intelligence agencies’ almost exclusive focus on Islamic extremists.<br />New Zealand banned semiautomatic weapons after the massacre—the deadliest peacetime shooting in New Zealand. Tarrant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole in August, the first time New Zealand had imposed a punishment denying any chance of release.<br />Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Tuesday apologized to New Zealand Muslims and said the government would implement all of the inquiry’s recommendations, including the establishment of a new national intelligence agency and an overhaul of counterterrorism methods.</td>

Austin’s nomination would represent the second time a retired general has been chosen to lead the department in recent years, after retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis.

Mr. Biden told reporters Monday that he planned to name a defense secretary nominee on Friday. Politico reported earlier that Mr. Biden was expected to choose the retired general.<br />Gen. Austin was chosen over at least two other nominees who were considered leading candidates for the post—Michèle Flournoy, who served as a top Pentagon official during the Obama administration, and Jeh Johnson, former Homeland Security secretary and onetime Pentagon general counsel.<br />Both Ms. Flournoy and Mr. Johnson came under criticism from some progressive groups within the Democratic Party, some of whom favored Gen. Austin because of his cautious approach to U.S. force deployment and his experience supervising the withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq in 2011.</td>

Canada has recorded the largest budget-balance deterioration this year among the Group of 20 because of its fiscal response, International Monetary Fund data indicate. Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal government also plans to spend an additional 100 billion Canadian dollars, or the equivalent of $78 billion, over the next three years to fortify the recovery.<br />Mr. Trudeau also reflected on Canada’s deteriorating relationship with China, in part over his country’s role in detaining Huawei Technologies Co.

The judge in that suit, Wendy Beetlestone, blocked the restrictions on Oct. 30.<br />The Commerce Department had been set on Nov. 12 to restrict U.S. companies from conducting transactions with TikTok, including hosting the company’s data and delivering the company’s content, which would have essentially made the app inoperable in the U.S.</td>

      <td>Lawyers for the two countries say Jewish heirs’ Holocaust-era claims have no place in U.S. courts</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Germany and Hungary appeared before the Supreme Court on Monday, asking the justices to bar Holocaust-era victims from seeking compensation in U.S. courts for property allegedly confiscated by the Nazi government and its allied regime in Budapest.<br />The cases are separate, involving different  procedural arguments over distinct forms of property. Germany is defending the 1935 acquisition of the Welfenschatz or Guelph Treasure, a trove of medieval religious artifacts held by a Berlin museum, while Hungary is opposing claims against the state railway MAV for items seized from Jews transported to death camps.<br />But both cases boil down to this: The former Axis nations contend that these claims should be resolved through the German and Hungarian legal systems rather than U.S. federal courts. In general, foreign governments can’t be sued in U.S. courts, but there are exceptions for certain types of claims, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that both cases could proceed.<br />In the German case, the D.C. Circuit found the claim fell under an exception allowing suits for expropriation of property in violation of international law. The plaintiffs—heirs and successors of Jewish art dealers who claim they were coerced into selling the artifacts—contend that property confiscation was an element of the Nazis’ genocidal policies and therefore violated international law.<br />Jonathan Freiman, a New Haven, Conn., lawyer representing Germany, told the justices that the plaintiffs were trying to use the Holocaust as “a jurisdictional hook” for a property claim that couldn’t otherwise be heard, as international law doesn’t prohibit states from confiscations within their own borders.</td>

      <td>Lawmakers also seek to iron out deal on state and local aid in roughly $900 billion framework</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Lawmakers struggled Monday to resolve a long-running dispute over what kind of liability protections to give businesses and other entities operating during the pandemic, one of two big stumbling blocks remaining in their efforts to strike a deal on an emergency relief package.<br />An expanding bipartisan group of Senate and House lawmakers has been working to hammer out details of the roughly $900 billion coronavirus relief framework detailed last week. Lawmakers held hourslong phone calls over the weekend and said they came closer to a final agreement on many elements. They are still, however, hashing out the two most contentious portions: the liability protections, long a top GOP priority; and funding for state and local governments, sought by Democrats.<br />“There are still some issues that are outstanding and it’s no secret generally speaking state and local and liability have always been the difficult issues,” said Rep. Tom Reed (R., N.Y.), co-chairman of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of 50 House lawmakers, which endorsed the $908 billion proposal. “That’s where we stand right now. I think we can get there.”<br />Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) said the two issues were essentially paired together to satisfy each party’s demands.<br />“It’s clear that Democrats want additional state and local money and Republicans by and large are asking for some common-sense liability provisions and those are coupled together,” he said.</td>

Uber said it would hold a roughly 26% stake in Aurora on completion of the deal. Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi also is joining the company’s board of directors.<br />Mr. Khosrowshahi has moved to restructure Uber to deliver on a promise to make the company profitable, scaling back many of its expensive side businesses—spanning from electric bikes to flying cars—that haven’t gained much traction. Uber has wound down its product incubator and artificial-intelligence lab, exited e-bikes and sold a stake in its loss-making freight-hauling unit. The company has promised to be profitable on an adjusted basis before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by the end of next year.<br />Uber said ATG, combined with other technology programs, lost $104 million in the third quarter on $25 million in revenue.<br />Aurora is led by autonomous-driving pioneer Chris Urmson, who helped launch Google’s autonomous-driving project. The acquisition bolsters Aurora’s position in an industry that has suffered under numerous technical setbacks.</td>

It also includes items related to anti-money-laundering efforts, cybersecurity, overseas military commitments, Space Force and the U.S. border wall.<br />In July, a Senate version of the bill passed 86-14, and the House version passed 295-125, more than the two-thirds supermajority needed to override a potential veto. Now, lawmakers are planning to vote on a compromise version and send it to the president’s desk.<br />The president has threatened to veto the NDAA for two reasons.</td>

      <td>Learning from the former secretary of State’s words of four years ago.</td>
      <td>One question hanging over the looming Biden Administration is whether its principals have learned from any of President Trump’s successes. Consider climate-envoy-to-be John Kerry’s Middle East views four years ago, shortly after Mr. Trump’s 2016 victory. Speaking at the Brookings Institution, Mr. Kerry, then Secretary of State, insisted that Palestinian peace was a precondition for Israel to make peace with its Arab neighbors.<br />“There will be no separate peace between Israel and the Arab world. I want to make that very clear to all of you,” Mr. Kerry said. “I’ve heard several prominent politicians in Israel sometimes saying, well, the Arab world’s in a different place now, and we just have to reach out to them and we can work some things with the Arab world, and we’ll deal with the Palestinians. No. No, no and no.”<br />He repeated: “There will be no advance and separate peace with the Arab world without the Palestinian process and Palestinian peace. Everybody needs to understand that. That is a hard reality.”<br />Well, this year the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan agreed in U.S.-brokered negotiations to normalize relations with Israel without a resolution in the Palestinian conflict. The Abraham Accords were achieved more or less by reversing team Obama’s Mideast policy, and closer Arab-Israeli cooperation puts the U.S. on a firmer regional footing.<br />Everyone makes mistakes, and Mr. Kerry was reflecting the consensus of professional Washington and the Mideast peace industry. Yet the deals show that hard power and shared interests matter more in world politics than center-left sentimentality. Israel and Sunni Arab states have a common threat in Iran and can benefit from mutual investment. Let’s hope the Biden Administration doesn’t throw away this progress.</td>

      <td>Republicans should insist on using the $429 billion in Fed funds.</td>
      <td>Both parties in Washington seem intent on passing another Covid relief bill this month, but it matters what’s in it and especially how it’s paid for. Republicans above all need to repurpose the unused funds from the Treasury backstop for the Federal Reserve’s 13(3) pandemic lending facilities.<br />The two sides are focusing on something close to $900 billion, which is much more than needed given the imminent arrival of Covid-19 vaccines. But at least that’s down from the Chuck Schumer-Nancy Pelosi demand of $2.2 trillion. The Speaker last week came off that attempt at political extortion, proving that it had been a gambit to prevent a deal before the election.<br />The Speaker figured the lack of a deal would hurt the GOP, and she even refused President Trump’s pre-election offer of $1.8 trillion. She got too politically greedy. Voters decided to slash her credit-card limit by reducing her House majority and giving the GOP a chance to keep its Senate majority in the two Georgia runoffs on Jan. 5.<br />Senate Republicans have offered a bill for somewhere north of $500 billion that would be an ample bridge to the vaccine. It would extend jobless benefits for gig workers not covered by regular unemployment benefits. It would provide a second round of paycheck protection loans for small businesses hurt by shutdowns. And it includes tens of billions for Covid-related health care such as building stockpiles of medical supplies, as well as $31 billion for vaccines and therapeutics.<br />Even better is what it leaves out. There’s no repeat of the $1,200 checks to most Americans, most of whom never lost their job or are re-employed. There’s also no direct aid for profligate states, though the states would benefit from the other payments, including for child care and schools. No doubt Democrats will demand more in negotiations, most of which is intended to help the public unions that run Illinois, New York and California.</td>

      <td>Joe Biden checked two Democratic boxes—Hispanic and lefty—on Monday by tapping California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to run Health and Human Services. Progressives are ecstatic, but Mr. Becerra’s views and lack of health-care experience are cause for close Senate confirmation scrutiny.<br />The Democratic identity politics crowd has been clamoring for Mr. Biden to appoint another Hispanic to his cabinet in addition to Alejandro Mayorkas at Homeland Security. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo had been a top contender for HHS, but she was vetoed by progressives as too white, too moderate and apparently also too qualified.<br />Mr. Becerra is none of those. The AG served 24 years in the House before being selected in 2016 by former Gov. Jerry Brown to replace Kamala Harris after she was elected to the Senate. In Congress he was a staunch progressive, co-sponsoring Medicare for All bills before the idea was in Democratic fashion.<br />He signed a letter in 2016 urging the Obama HHS to use “march-in rights” to invalidate drug-maker patents for medicines whose research was partly government funded. This could encompass most drugs. Earlier this year he pushed the Trump Administration to confiscate Gilead’s patent for its Covid antiviral remdesivir.<br />Mr. Becerra has no expertise in how drug and insurance markets function, let alone experience running a health-care bureaucracy. His apparent primary qualification is that he’s filed 100 some lawsuits against the Trump Administration, though he’s won relatively few and lost on health-care issues. In 2017 Obama-appointed federal Judge Vince Chhabria slapped down his lawsuit against the Trump Administration for ending cost-sharing reduction subsidies that Congress never appropriated and had to give the AG a tutorial in the Affordable Care Act and insurance markets.</td>

      <td>The stakes in the Georgia U.S. Senate races on Jan. 5, 2021, between Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler and their respective challengers, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, are very high for a host of reasons. One that has not received enough attention is the readiness of our military. The U.S. faces rising threats from China, Russia and Iran, and continued robust funding of our military is clearly at stake in Georgia, which will decide the Senate majority. Nowhere is the divide between Democrats and Republicans more important.<br />For decades the Democratic Party has staked out a position of diminishing the importance of U.S. military readiness. President Jimmy Carter slashed defense spending in the first three years of his term. This created a hollow force, only to have the Soviets and Iranians take advantage of America’s weakened presence in the Middle East, which forced Mr. Carter to increase spending at the end of his term. President Bill Clinton cut the size of the military by a third, reversing a decade of progress under the Reagan and first Bush administrations.<br />More recently, Barack Obama and Joe Biden oversaw a 25% reduction in the military budget during their second term. The cuts were more than numbers—they dramatically undermined our military’s combat readiness and the morale of our troops.<br />In 2015, only three of the Army’s 58 brigade combat teams—the 5,000-strong deployable units in the Army—were combat-ready and capable of completing their missions. Less than half of the Navy’s and Marine Corps’ aviation fleets were flight-ready, and only half of the Navy’s amphibious ships were available to support contingency operations. The circumstances in late 2016 and early 2017 were so dire that the Army publicly expressed concerns about running out of bullets.<br />A main reason Mr. Perdue and I first ran for office in 2014 was to reverse these reckless cuts to our military. We were part of the class of 12 freshman who ushered in Republican control of the Senate and later worked closely with President Trump to give priority to the rebuilding of our military, its morale and readiness. We have made historic progress.</td>

Following months of economic lockdowns, sheltering in place, and huge numbers of businesses being forced to close permanently, many of my peers are likely not looking forward to these addresses. Some will propose tax increases. Others will take on more debt, and a few will be forced to make significant budget cuts. In South Dakota, as we have done throughout this pandemic, we will forge a different path.<br />Rather than following the pack and mandating harsh rules, South Dakota provides our residents with information about what is happening on the ground in our state—the science, facts and data. Then, we ask all South Dakotans to take personal responsibility for their health, the health of their loved ones, and—in turn—the health of our communities. The state hasn’t issued lockdowns or mask mandates. We haven’t shut down businesses or closed churches. In fact, our state has never even defined what an “essential business” is. That isn’t the government’s role.<br />Since March, many of my peers have attempted to stop the spread of the virus without considering their citizens’ social or mental well-being or the state of their economies. Even amid a pandemic, public policy ought to be holistic. Daily needs must still be met. People need to eat and keep a roof over their heads. And they still need purpose. That means policy makers cannot have tunnel vision. They must balance public-health concerns with people’s mental and emotional needs, their economic livelihoods and social connections, and liberty, among many other important factors.<br />Many in the media have criticized this approach, labeling me ill-informed, reckless and even a “denier.” Some have asserted that South Dakota is “as bad as it gets anywhere in the world” when it comes to Covid-19—a demonstrably false statement. At the same time, my critics praise states that issued lockdowns, mandated masks and shut down businesses—lauding these states as having taken the “right” steps to mitigate the spread of the virus.</td>

      <td>Information has never been more plentiful or easier to distribute. Yet we are sliding into a new age of censorship and suppression, encouraged by technology giants and traditional media companies. As someone who’s been falsely characterized as a coronavirus “denier,” I have seen this crisis firsthand.<br />Since June,  Amazon  has twice tried to suppress self-published booklets I have written about Covid-19 and the response to it. These booklets don’t contain conspiracy theories. Like the scientists who wrote the Great Barrington Declaration, I simply believe many measures to control the coronavirus have been damaging, counterproductive and unsupported by science.<br />Amazon has said earlier that “as a bookseller, we believe that providing access to the written word is important, including books that some may find objectionable.” The company sells “Mein Kampf” and “The Anarchist’s Cookbook.” But when it comes to Covid, Amazon has a different standard. At least half a dozen other authors have emailed me that their books have been pulled. Amazon won’t disclose how many, or other details about how it picks books to censor.<br />Google-owned YouTube censors even more aggressively. The company disclosed in October that it had pulled more than 200,000 videos about the epidemic—including one from Scott Atlas, a physician who was advising President Trump.  Facebook  has not only censored videos and attached warning labels or “fact checks” to news articles, but removed groups that oppose lockdowns and other restrictions.<br />That online entertainment and retail companies have benefited financially from lockdowns adds to the ugliness of their suppression efforts. Interestingly,  Apple —whose mobile business means it gains less than other big tech companies—has been less aggressive.</td>

      <td>John Lennon’s most famous song is far from his best.</td>
      <td>Forty years after John Lennon’s murder, be prepared to hear a lot of “Imagine.” The 1971 solo hit has become Lennon’s unofficial anthem, but it doesn’t come close to best representing his gifts.<br />In a cafe recently, the Beatles’ “Help!” (1965) came on the sound system. I was riveted by its emotional clarity, and struck at the contrast with the tuneful but naive “Imagine” with its jejune, airy-fairy fantasies: “You may say I’m a dreamer / But I’m not the only one / I hope some day you’ll join us / And the world will be as one.”<br />Lennon once cited “Help!” (along with “Strawberry Fields Forever”) as one of “the few true songs I ever wrote,” meaning that it was based on real life, not artifice. The singer of “Help!” was a young man who had the world at his feet and millions in the bank, but felt a howling torrent of pain. “And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,” he sings. “My independence seems to vanish in the haze / But every now and then I feel so insecure / I know that I just need you like I’ve never done before.”<br />We all spend a lot of energy trying to show others—and ourselves—how well we’re doing. And simultaneously convince ourselves, too. “Help!” is the opposite of this, a full-out airing of real feeling. I don’t know another rock ’n’ roll song that connects like “Help!” does.<br />Lennon was a product of his Northern English environment, in which men were expected to be hard and stoic, not open and vulnerable. The 1960s were loaded with radical lyrics, from Sam Cooke’s “A Change Is Gonna Come” to Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind.” But a Lennon line in “Help!”—“Now I find I’ve changed my mind and opened up the doors” shocks me, hits me, enlivens me, every time I hear it.</td>

      <td>As workers become fewer in number and global wages rise, we may see less inequality but more inflation and higher interest rates.</td>
      <td>Mountains are thrown up by colliding tectonic plates, but the forces at work in their creation are hidden from view and were, for a time, ill-understood. In advanced societies in recent decades, we have seen striking changes in work, investment and income distribution, yet central bankers and ministers of finance, among others, have failed to grasp the underlying forces that brought them about. In “The Great Demographic Reversal,” Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan, both Britain-based economists, vividly document past demographic changes, along with their broad effects, and outline the strikingly different changes that, in their view, are soon to come. Not only is their book well argued, but it is bold as well. It defies the conventional wisdom that inflation will not be a problem in the near future.<br />The authors begin by focusing on a critical event: the opening up of an urbanizing China—as well of other, smaller countries, especially in Asia and Eastern Europe—and the insertion of many millions of low-paid workers into the global trading system. This increased workforce sharply increased the production of goods and services, which put downward pressure on global prices. But the wages of workers in advanced countries fell even more as employers moved production offshore or made credible threat to do so. Unskilled and semi-skilled workers bore the brunt of the wage shift, and income inequality rose accordingly.<br />The ramifications of this positive supply shock, as Messrs. Goodhart and Pradhan show, were wide-ranging. With domestic wages flattened or lowered, and offshore investment beckoning, domestic investment in new plant and equipment stagnated, and income was distributed ever more unequally. The combination of rising global supply and falling domestic demand also had financial effects: With inflation suppressed, interest rates fell to historic lows. This is the world we see around us now. In the U.S., at the moment, the 10-year Treasury yield is less than 1%; the European Central Bank charges commercial banks for holding deposits with it; and there are now around $17 trillion of bonds world-wide offering a negative rate of return.<br />As convincing as their portrait of past trends may be, Messrs. Goodhart and Pradhan, in “The Great Demographic Reversal,” are intent on arguing that things are going to change again. Indeed, they note that the new trends are already becoming evident. Urbanization in China is slowing, and its working-age population is shrinking. In advanced countries, the ratio of “dependents” to workers is rising sharply as baby boomers retire. Retirees are not only living longer but are increasingly prone to dementia at older ages. As the need for caregivers intensifies, there will be fewer workers available for other work.<br />A rising dependency ratio, Messrs. Goodhart and Pradhan explain, is inherently inflationary, since “dependents” consume but do not produce. Meanwhile, workers are likely to consume more as a shortage of labor pushes up wages, and investment will rise in advanced countries as companies substitute capital for more expensive labor. In short, demand will rise even as supply potential falls. While new technology could increase productivity enough to offset the shortage of workers, the authors (quoting conflicting views by respected experts) refuse to assume that it will.</td>

      <td>One of the biggest board recruiting rushes in U.S. corporate history is set to commence, and it is likely to be a delicate one.<br />A new board-diversity proposal from  Nasdaq Inc.  and a similar mandate passed in California this fall are expected to pave the way for potentially thousands of people with racially and sexually diverse backgrounds to join corporate boards over the next few years. Nasdaq—which would require listed companies to have at least one woman and another director who is either a racial minority or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer—has found that three-quarters of its nearly 3,000 listed companies don’t meet its proposed criteria.<br />Recruiting those directors raises a set of awkward challenges for companies. A board candidate’s ethnic background or sexual orientation isn’t always obvious, and scouting those candidates can require some unconventional digging, recruiters and directors say. A bigger, more sensitive issue, many say, is making their boardroom additions more than just a check-the-box exercise.<br />“When I get those calls, my first reaction isn’t, ‘Oh I’m getting those calls because I’m a Black woman.’ My first reaction is: ‘Oh, I’m getting the call because I’m a finance person,’ ” said Mary Winston, a director at companies including  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.  and  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.,  of calls she has gotten about filling other board vacancies. Still, “I can’t say it’s not in the back of my mind,” said Ms. Winston, a former chief financial officer at Family Dollar.<br />Repeated studies have shown a link between board diversity and better financial results, and there is an abundance of senior-level women and minority executives who more than meet the necessary qualifications for directorships, said Beth Stewart, chief executive of Trewstar Corporate Board Services, a recruiting firm.</td>

But the second Avalanches LP, the solid but less impressive “Wildflower,” didn’t arrive until 16 years later, so it was hard to hold your breath waiting for album number three. “We Will Always Love You” (Astralwerks), out Friday, is the band’s new LP, and it rewards that patience.</td>

      <td>Initiative seeks to provide high-speed internet access for millions over next decade</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Federal Communications Commission dedicated $9.2 billion to fund construction of rural broadband networks over the next decade, in what the agency’s leader called the biggest ever U.S. step to extend high-speed internet service.<br />The funding will go to internet service providers, from established rural operators such as Windstream Holdings Inc. to newcomers such as cable provider  Charter Communications Inc.  and Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The companies bid against each other in an auction designed to steer public money to the company willing to build the fastest network in each area at the lowest cost.<br />“I’m thrilled with the incredible success of this auction, which brings welcome news to millions of unconnected rural Americans who for too long have been on the wrong side of the digital divide. They now stand to gain access to high-speed, high-quality broadband service,” said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai.<br />The providers have 10 years to build the networks, with incentives to do so sooner rather than later. The FCC said the auction covered more than 5 million homes and businesses in 49 states. In about 85% of locations, the providers promised ultrafast “gigabit” speed, the agency said. Most of the remaining locations would see download speeds of at least 100 megabits a second, capable of large downloads.<br />Of the 180 companies that made successful bids, LTD Broadband LLC secured the most funding—about $1.3 billion—to serve more than 500,000 homes and businesses. The company has previously used tower-mounted “fixed wireless” technology. Charter, operator of the Spectrum brand, secured about $1.2 billion to serve more than 1 million locations across 24 states. A consortium of rural electric companies won about $1.1 billion.</td>

Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), followed a Wall Street Journal article that said Google was weighing severe penalties against IAC, under Chairman Barry Diller, for software it created for Google’s Chrome web browser. An internal Google audit found that IAC extensions—external applications ostensibly installed to provide weather updates or Bible verses—often don’t provide users the functions they promised and direct them to advertising.<br />The IAC products frequently change a users’ default search engine from Google to IAC’s own search site, sparking confusion and complaints from users, Google’s trust and safety team found in the audit. Beyond the Google investigators’ concerns about the utility of the browser extensions, the review found that the software had been marketed via ads placed on Google that falsely claimed to help users register to vote, find a polling place or apply for a coronavirus stimulus check.<br />“Given the troubling practices discovered by Google’s trust and safety audit, your company’s continued financial relationship with IAC raises serious questions,” Mr. Wyden wrote to Mr. Pichai. He asked for the answers to nine questions, including whether Google executives overruled internal recommendations to take action against IAC.<br />A Google spokesman earlier said it was still reviewing the issue.</td>

The average investment-grade corporate bond yielded just 1.85%, according to Bloomberg Barclays data.<br />So-called real yields—or the return investors can expect on bonds after adjusting for inflation—have been below zero for months on U.S. government debt. But last week marked the first time in records going back to 2003 that the phenomenon ever extended to a broad index of corporate bonds.<br />The two situations are related; negative real yields on U.S. Treasurys drive investors to buy riskier assets in search of better returns. Many have turned to corporate bonds, driving yields to new lows in recent months, investors and analysts say.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury inflation protected security—a proxy for real Treasury yields—is currently around minus-0.97%. That means investors can still pick up a meaningful amount of return by buying corporate bonds.</td>

While violations can have career-ending consequences for lower-level federal employees, top officials have rarely faced significant punishment for breaching it.<br />The report identifies six media interviews from May 2020 to October 2020 in which Mr. Navarro appeared in his official capacity and criticized Mr. Biden or his then-running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris. “Dr. Navarro often attacked Mr. Biden about his relationship with China and at times accused him of being ‘compromised’ and susceptible to being ‘bought’ by China, even nicknaming him ‘Beijing Biden,’ ” the report says. Mr. Navarro launched similar criticisms of Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris on his official  Twitter  account, according to the report.<br />The Office of Special Counsel sent its findings to President Trump for disciplinary action. The White House declined to comment on the report, and Mr. Navarro didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Second, to appease the expected political overlords of a Biden administration and EPA who will dictate the product portfolio of automobiles produced versus the market via mandates and regulatory credits.<br />The socialization of the U.S. automobile market is intensifying. More and more the CEOs of auto companies will seek the conformity of political regulators and woke PR gestures instead of providing what customers really want. Increasingly there will be a dependence of revenue based on what the government gives them in credits or takes away in penalties rather than what makes real profit. Those of us on the retail end of the car business for decades know this because we deal with real customers.<br />Electric cars are a part of the future but should compete on their own merits and not have to count on elevated sales due to heavy-handed regulations on their competition. Both the consumer and the environment have always benefited more from fair market competition of evolving technologies than the virtuous regulators and CEOs who try to appease them. Imagine if in the 1800s the government mandated steam engines as the way of the future and regulated out the alternatives. The automobile industry shouldn’t be constrained with that mind-set and certainly not with the dictates from a state which often can’t keep its electric lights on, as if it were still the 1800s.<br />Karl Miller<br />Mount Vernon, N.Y.</td>

Asked earlier Monday about reports of the sanctions ahead of their announcement, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in Beijing condemned such moves as meddling in China’s sovereign affairs and defended the Chinese legislature as acting in accordance with the constitution and laws.<br />The National People’s Congress Standing Committee officials are responsible for a new national security law imposed on Hong Kong that the State Department said “effectively neutered the ability of the people of Hong Kong to choose their elected representatives.”</td>

      <td>Settlement is largest civil penalty ever paid for telemarketing violations under the FTC Act, Justice Department says</td>
      <td>A  Dish Network Corp.  subsidiary will pay $210 million in penalties related to alleged telemarketing violations, in a settlement with the Justice Department and four states.<br />The U.S. government, along with California, Illinois, North Carolina and Ohio, said Dish made millions of unlawful telemarketing calls to consumers and was behind millions more by retailers that marketed Dish products and services. The federal government and the states filed the suit against Dish Network LLC in 2009. The case went to trial in 2016.<br />The Justice Department said the settlement is the largest civil penalty ever paid for telemarketing violations under the Federal Trade Commission Act. It also exceeds total penalties paid by all prior violators of the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule to the government, the DOJ added.<br />“We have long taken our compliance with telemarketing laws seriously and we maintain rigorous telemarketing compliance procedures and policies,” the company said Monday. “While we respectfully disagree with the underlying liability judgment, which involved telemarketing calls made between 2003 and 2011, this matter is now resolved.”<br />The company last week said in a securities filing that it had already set aside the fine amount, and that it has until Jan. 3 to pay the penalties.</td>

      <td>Payments company Square has released a line of clothes named after its digital wallet</td>
      <td>If someone is asking for “just cash” this year, you can still surprise them with a fluorescent camouflage sweatshirt from Cash by Cash App, an apparel collection that has recently been unveiled by payments company  Square .<br />Named after Square’s multipurpose digital wallet application, the collection features brightly colored T-shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies and other apparel. It appears already largely sold out or low in stock. The move comes after the Cash App has recently been name-checked in hip-hop songs.<br />But before investors panic about a pivot by the highly valued payments upstart to the lower-margin clothing business, consider an analysis by Mizuho’s Dan Dolev in a recent note. “What is more plausible is that this could be a test for a closed-loop e-commerce checkout button,” he wrote. Or, as Mr. Dolev put it, a “clothed loop.”<br />Mr. Dolev noted that not only can buyers purchase the clothing using the Cash App, they also get a 25% discount for doing so. One longtime ambition of some Square investors has been to see the company evolve further into having an app that is used by both consumers and merchants to make and receive payments in a transaction, effectively controlling both sides of the purchase. The collection’s site was also built using Square’s online store software.<br />Gross payment volume that includes Cash App use for business purposes was already up 332% in the third quarter from a year earlier to $2.9 billion, according to the company. The real gift might be to Square’s investors if shopping with Cash App becomes a holiday habit.</td>

He has left Vatican City only rarely since the start of the pandemic.<br />The exact program of events will take into account the state of the global pandemic, the Vatican said. Vatican officials declined to say whether the pope plans to appear at public events that would draw crowds. Papal trips typically feature public Masses with congregations of thousands of people, even in countries without a Catholic majority.</td>

      <td>A stream of football players are ending their collegiate careers early to dodge Covid and prepare for the pros.</td>
      <td>Last June, Minnesota wide receiver Rashod Bateman couldn’t sleep. He buzzed with nervous thoughts about whether the coronavirus pandemic would tackle the 2020 college football season, likely his final one before turning pro.<br />Then his nerves became feverish sweats, body aches and chills. Like hundreds of thousands of other Americans, Bateman had a symptomatic case of Covid-19. “I’m back healthy and everything is fine, but I still feel like there is some residue left from Covid,” he said this week. “It still has some type of effect on my body because of my asthma.”<br />So when an outbreak of at least 49 cases decimated the tail end of Minnesota’s schedule, Bateman decided not to take any chances. He opted out of the season on Nov. 26 to get ready for the next stage of his career. “With only a few games left and Covid spiking, I thought it was best to step aside and start my professional career,” he said.<br />Bateman is part of a growing roster of players that are walking away from their college football careers—deep into the season, as the College Football Playoff race takes shape and coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths reach record highs in the United States.<br />In the last two weeks, more than a dozen athletes from college football’s top five conferences–the Atlantic Coast, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-12 and Southeastern Conferences–have opted out. They hail from programs like Texas, Florida State, Kentucky and Central Florida. And they join more than 150 other players who made the same choice this summer.</td>

      <td>Trump’s crazy election theories come after the media has been peddling similar fare for years.</td>
      <td>If I’d told you two years ago that Donald Trump and Stacey Abrams would be soulmates, conjoined one day as victims of a dark political conspiracy by a Republican Party intent on denying them their rightful status as popular winners, you’d have asked me to take a sobriety test. But here we are.<br />Ms. Abrams still insists she’s the winner of the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia. She maintains that her opponent, Brian Kemp—the man legally declared the victor after vote tabulations gave him a 55,000 margin—rigged the election in his own favor by suppressing Democratic voter turnout. This in an election in which turnout set a new record for the state in a nonpresidential year.<br />Two years on, Gov. Kemp—aided, it seems, by the entire executive leadership of the state, Republican loyalists to a man—has done it again. This time out of a nagging sense of fair play perhaps, he has fixed the presidential election in Georgia in favor of Joe Biden.<br />I don’t know about you, but Mr. Kemp sounds like someone I want on my side. I wonder if he does tax returns.<br />This vast—and confusing—right-and-left-wing conspiracy in the Peach State is a useful reminder that, while the media tell us that paranoid conspiracy theorizing is now the defining feature of the modern Republican party, the tendency to believe—or purport to believe—false things that are useful to your cause is no respecter of party or ideology.</td>

The end of the Covid-19 pandemic is in sight, but we aren’t there yet.<br />The country learned a hard lesson early on about the fragility of global supply chains. Available information about the disease changed with every passing week, making a national consensus on the public-health response impossible to achieve. Testing protocols, policies and capacity varied within and among states, and the U.S., for the most part, doesn’t test people as often as it should. Kids and families have suffered as a result of sudden school closures and haphazard reopenings.<br />There have been bright spots. Some Americans made enormous sacrifices to protect their neighbors and colleagues. Even simple gestures like wearing masks, as most Americans do, saved lives. Doctors, nurses, hospital workers, long-term caregivers, first responders and emergency personnel proved to be what Americans always knew they were—the very best in the world at what they do. Businesses pivoted their operations in a matter of weeks to protect their workforces and provide vital products to fight the virus.<br />Politically, despite their many differences, Democrats and Republicans at the federal level came together to enact several relief packages, including the Cares Act, which rescued businesses, supported people who lost their jobs, funded food programs, invested in testing and tracing, and provided billions to state and local governments. It was a grand gesture, and for the most part, it worked.</td>

      <td>If they want workers to be more vigilant, fear doesn’t work. Fortunately, there are alternatives.</td>
      <td>Companies often turn to a powerful emotion to get employees to be vigilant about cybersecurity. They scare them.<br />If you do this, or don’t do that, something awful will happen. Click on phishing messages, and the company’s network will be exposed to hackers. Use simple passwords, and your personal files will get stolen.<br />The problem: Fear doesn’t work. Sure, it may get people to act in that moment. But scare tactics don’t get people invested in security over the long term, as Marc Dupuis of Washington University and I discovered in research last year.<br />In fact, it can do the opposite. That is because fear can leave employees in a constant state of anxiety, which makes them unable to think clearly about threats. Alternatively, such heavy-handed, scare messaging can make employees disgruntled and uninterested in security, thinking that the threats are exaggerated—and that bosses don’t trust them to do the right thing.<br />But fear not. Although scaring employees may not be an effective way to keep them vigilant, there are other tools that do work. First, let’s dig deeper into why fear doesn’t work.</td>

      <td>A community of rabid collectors and resellers are amassing old Patagonia fleeces, driving up the price for jackets in manic patterns and with particularly plush shells.</td>
      <td>FORGET BITCOIN. If you’re looking for a surefire investment right now, try buying and reselling old Patagonia fleeces. Kelsey Silverstein, 28, and Mark Donoher, 30, resold a Sea Turtle-patterned Snap-T fleece from 1996 for $165 about a year and a half ago. Today that same fleece could fetch more than $300 online. Rather than worry that they sold it too soon, the couple—who run Orbital Outdoors, an online clothing store dedicated to vintage outdoor gear—is looking ahead. “I’m hoarding the best stuff,” said Mr. Donoher who is convinced the market can only go up. “I think everything right now is just beginning.”<br />The Orbital pair are part of an ever-growing network of Patagonia flippers and collectors obsessed with pre-Y2K fleece. “I’m a freak when it comes to vintage Patagonia,” said Kyle Criscitello, 22, a reseller in Vienna, Va. Mr. Criscitello acquired his first Patagonia fleece as a teenager, but says he didn’t fully appreciate the Ventura, Calif.-based outdoor outfitter—founded by Vvon Chouinard in 1973—until he studied environmental design in college. “I got really into Yvon Chouinard and everything he is and stands for,” said Mr. Criscitello.<br />What Mr. Chouinard stands for—to Mr. Criscitello and many others—is environmental consciousness and buying less. Patagonia’s stores are closed on Black Friday and its ads often promote the idea of wearing clothes until they crumble. The company even sells used Patagonia gear traded in by customers under its “Worn Wear” program. This “anti-new” stance might seem odd but it has endeared a generation of vintage fleece hounds to the brand. (A Patagonia representative declined to comment.)<br />Not all fleeces fit the bill. Today’s nostalgic fleece-fanatics fall roughly into two camps: the texture specialists and the pattern nuts. Texture heads will tell you that newer, crisper jackets (which increasingly are fabricated using recycled materials) can’t hold a candle to their fluffy forebears. “I definitely prefer the older stuff,” said Colby Cook, 21, a student and part-time clothing reseller in Austin, Texas, who owns more than 30 “deep pile” fleeces, some of which date back to 1988. “Deep pile” refers to the jacket’s fuzzy shell, tenderly evocative of a Teddy Ruxpin. For collectors like Mr. Cook, who operates @DeepPilesForMiles, an Instagram account cataloging his collection, these luscious shells are the holy grail.<br />Both texture fans and pattern connoisseurs, who live for collectible motifs, believe that pre-2000 jackets almost always beat models from the past twenty years. What Virginia’s Mr. Criscitello finds so incredible about Patagonia fleeces from the ’90s—“and even the late-’80s”—is that the color-blocking and patterns are “just so original.” (A typical palette might be coral, cinnamon-brown and pumpkin, while motifs range from stylized gargoyles to vaguely Aztec plant forms). He’s so smitten that he created OldSchoolOutdoor.com, a crowd-sourced online database of zanily patterned pullover Patagonia Snap-Ts that date from 1985, when they made their debut, to fall 2000.</td>

It’s going to happen. The Browns currently sit at a sturdy 9-3, which means they’re a mathematical lock to finish the 16-game 2020 NFL season with more Ws than Ls. No recount, no machine error, put this one in the books. It’s a rarity: the Browns haven’t finished with a winning record in 13 seasons. It’s only happened twice before in this century. It’s like seeing a comet, or reading a coherent Journal sports column.<br />I’m not saying the Browns are going win the Super Bowl this season. But I’m not not saying it, either. I’ve seen plenty of craziness during this cockamamie year—so have you, I’m sure. How can any of us rule out another bizarre scenario, even this historically woebegone outfit playing meaningful football in February, or March, or late August, or whenever they wind up playing the Super Bowl?<br />(Yes, I know Patrick Mahomes exists, as do the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Browns probably will have to get through one of those behemoths to go anywhere. I’ll get to that in a second. Let’s give Cleveland a minute of love here.)</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler has decided to retain current standards for soot pollution, keeping fine-particle pollution limits adopted in 2012 that set the bar at 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air.<br />EPA staff scientists in a draft report last year said key studies could support imposing tougher standards of between 8 and 10 micrograms per cubic meter. The report cited estimates that limits within that range could cut mortality risks by more than 20%, potentially saving more than 12,000 lives a year.<br />EPA officials said they decided to keep current standards after review by a scientific advisory committee and considering public comments. U.S. particulate matter levels are 20% lower than in France, Germany and Great Britain, five times below the global average and six times below levels in China, officials said.<br />“The EPA under the Trump Administration has continued America’s leadership in clear air, lowering our particulate matter levels to well below those of many of our global competitors,” Mr. Wheeler said in a statement. “Maintaining these important standards will ensure Americans can continue to breathe some of the cleanest air on the planet.”<br />The Sierra Club environmental group criticized the decision, saying soot poses the biggest threat to minority and low-income neighborhoods that are often located near industrial plants.</td>

That is slightly less than what is needed to vaccinate all front-line medical professionals and long-term care residents—the groups that a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel has recommended should be first in line.<br />Federal estimates show there are about 24 million people in these high-priority groups—21 million health-care workers and three million residents of long-term care facilities.<br />That leaves hospitals with the task of deciding who among their high-priority employees should go first. Nebraska Medicine, the hospitals and clinics affiliated with the University of Nebraska Medical Center, will likely use a lottery. The Mayo Clinic is combing through data on occupational risks to decide who to put at the top of the list. Mass General Brigham in Boston is prioritizing the hospital units where workers have most exposure to those with Covid-19.<br />The CDC has said priority should go to health-care workers who come into direct contact with Covid-19 patients and patients’ families, and with infectious materials. Workers who have had Covid-19 could wait 90 days from infection before seeking vaccination, a period during which research suggests little risk of reinfection, the CDC said.</td>

Fulfilling this promise entails politically fraught decisions over how to do it and who would benefit.<br />Mr. Biden, a Democrat, campaigned on forgiving hundreds of billions of dollars of student debt, starting with a $10,000 write-off for all 43 million Americans with federal loans. Some congressional Democrats and activist groups are pushing him to go further, forgiving most or all of the $1.6 trillion in student debt.<br />Student debt is the largest type of debt held by Americans after mortgages. The amount has tripled since 2007. Defaults are high. Many economists say that canceling at least some debt would boost the U.S. economy by reducing borrowers’ bills, leaving them with more money to spend on homes and cars, or even starting businesses.<br />To move forward, the Biden administration has to choose how broad or targeted to make the debt reductions, risking helping groups seen as undeserving and widening political fault lines between those with college degrees and those without.<br />“Whether Democrat, Republicans or Independent, you understand there’s an issue here and it needs to be addressed,” said Wayne Johnson, a former Education Department official in the Trump administration who unsuccessfully ran for a Georgia Senate seat this year campaigning as a Republican on canceling student debt.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Former Sen. Paul Sarbanesundefined, who represented Maryland for 30 years in the Senate and helped write landmark antifraud legislation and draft the first article of impeachment against Republican President Richard Nixon as a congressman, has died, his son said. He was 87.<br />The Democrat “passed away peacefully this evening in Baltimore,” said a Sunday statement by Rep. John Sarbanes, who represents Maryland’s 3rd Congressional District.<br />“Our family is grateful to know that we have the support of Marylanders who meant so much to him and whom he was honored to serve,” the congressman said.<br />His statement didn’t reveal the cause of Paul Sarbanes’s death. His office didn’t immediately reply to questions from the Baltimore Sun.<br />Mr. Sarbanes got into politics in 1966 with a successful run for Maryland’s House of Delegates, and then won a seat in Congress four years later. He earned a spot on the House Judiciary Committee, where he drafted the first article of impeachment against Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal, the Washington Post reported.</td>

      <td>The cybersecurity world pays a lot of attention to protecting privacy. Privacy from hackers. Privacy from governments intruding on the lives of their citizens. Privacy from businesses that have an unprecedented volume of data that can be used to target or profile consumers.<br />But with so many people working from home, privacy has taken on an added dimension: the privacy of information from the ordinary, everyday intrusion by family or colleagues.<br />There is, for instance, the loss of privacy when your colleagues overhear you arguing with your children, or see what you read on the bookshelves behind you. Or the loss of privacy when your spouse can see what’s on your computer or how you handled your midafternoon Zoom call.<br />That’s exactly why so many of us need a work-from-home privacy strategy: a set of guidelines for what needs to stay private from whom, and a plan that makes it easy to stick to those guidelines.<br />It may be obvious to say this, but it bears saying anyway: Your employer and your clients are counting on you to keep their information private. That may not be a big deal when you’re in an office and bring work home some nights or on weekends. But it’s a much bigger issue when all your work and every conversation is available for anybody walking past you or your computer. Your spouse or your 10-year-old son may not feel quite as compelled to keep secrets as you do.</td>

The emergency authorization would give its companies the ability and confidence to ramp up production.<br />Serum Institute already has more than 40 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine made and could have more than 100 million by the end of the year, said a company spokesman.</td>

International investors don’t seem to have particularly noticed.<br />The entire surge in international purchases of Japanese equities recorded from late 2012 to mid-2015, totaling around $240 billion, has melted away in the subsequent years. And foreigners have again sold more Japanese stocks than they bought this year.<br />That may sound like a surprise to readers who have noticed a distinct turn toward optimism from banks and asset managers looking ahead to 2021. And, indeed, there are many reasons to be optimistic.<br />The recovery story that most analysts and investors seem prepared for would be good news for Japanese stocks. Analysts at BCA Research note that almost 40% of the MSCI Japan is made up of industrial and consumer discretionary stocks, compared with more like 20% in the U.S. The index has a price-to-earnings ratio of a little over 18, compared with a little below 24 for the U.S., and is more cheaply valued even on a sector-by-sector basis.<br />The market is also notably cash rich, allowing for more shareholder-friendly dividend and buyback policies than companies in Europe and the U.S. may be able to manage. Both European and U.S. stocks have total debt to total equity ratios in excess of 110%, while Japan’s is below 90%. There are no magic numbers when it comes to corporate leverage, but servicing debt and dealing with any increase in spreads is now clearly a greater concern elsewhere in the developed world.</td>

      <td>Experts at top medical centers discuss quarantining, testing and informing people that you may be infected</td>
      <td>The desserts were delicious, the reunions were warm, but you’ve just learned that someone at the holiday gathering you attended had Covid-19. What next? Today’s shorter quarantine guidelines, a variety of tests and newly available therapies call for updated protocols. So what should you do if you feel sick or if you spent time near the fellow guest who has been diagnosed? And is it safer to get tested if you’re considering meeting with family within the next several weeks?<br />Here’s what infectious-disease experts at some of the country’s top medical centers advise.<br /><br />How can you assess your level of exposure?<br />Before taking steps to get tested, determine your level of exposure and whether you’ve had close contact. Seeing others outside—with everyone wearing masks—doesn’t warrant a test. If both people were unmasked and within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes, that qualifies as exposure and warrants a test. If you wore a mask and the other person didn’t and was at a greater distance, exposure is less likely and you may not need to get tested, according to Peter Katona, professor of medicine and public health at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. If you’re indoors and have had close contact, defined as being within 6 feet of someone for a total of 15 minutes over 24 hours, you’re a good candidate for getting tested. “If somebody is exchanging air with you, then you have a chance of getting infected,” says Dr. Katona.</td>

      <td>SÃO PAULO—The election of Joe Biden as U.S. president will raise pressure on Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to step up the country’s effort to curb growing deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.<br />Deforestation in the Amazon has accelerated under the Brazilian leader—in part, environmentalists say, because his calls for economic development in the jungle have emboldened land grabbers, illegal ranchers and wildcat miners. The former army officer once nicknamed himself “Captain Chainsaw.”<br />Official data released last week showed deforestation at a 12-year high. About 4,300 square miles of forest, more than three quarters the size of Connecticut, were lost in the 12 months to July this year—up 9.5% from the same period a year earlier, according to satellite data from Brazil’s space agency, Inpe.<br />The rising deforestation has led to growing pressure at home and abroad on the Brazilian nationalist. France has cited deforestation as a reason for holding up passage of a large trade deal between the European Union and Mercosur, the South American bloc, of which Brazil is the biggest member.<br />British supermarkets have already threatened to boycott Brazil’s products, while apparel and footwear company  VF Corp. —owner of Timberland, Vans and the North Face—stopped using Brazilian leather last year in protest over destruction of the Amazon.</td>

      <td>Low oil prices aren’t exactly at the top of pipeline operators’ wish lists, but they do come with one possible upside: They could help boost the value of existing infrastructure.<br />Depressed oil demand has led energy companies across the value chain—from those pumping it, to those transporting, refining and converting it into other products—to hold back on new investments. Permitting challenges already were slowing down new pipelines. The pandemic’s shock to the oil market was like slamming on the brakes.<br />In the third quarter, capital expenditures in the oil-and-gas industry were less than half the lowest level recorded in the economic crisis in 2009, according to Dean Forman, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute. The decline in spending applies not only to companies pumping oil and gas but also those in the crucial business of transporting and refining hydrocarbons. In the midstream sector, capital expenditures were down almost 30% year over year in the third quarter, according to API data.<br />Just as investors are asking for more discipline from producers of oil and natural gas, they also are demanding moderation from pipeline operators. Project return thresholds are getting higher for these companies, and investors are asking them to give priority to debt repayment rather than new projects, according to Timm Schneider, head of Americas energy and utility equity research at Citi Research.<br />All of that adds more speed bumps to new pipeline additions. President Trump’s moves to expedite controversial projects came with the unintended consequence of fueling challenges to permits that stood on shakier legal ground. The incoming Biden administration is unlikely to make things easier.</td>

The move helps Mr. Dylan set up his musical legacy and cash in on his life’s work.<br />Over the past five years, owning and selling the rights to music has become more valuable, as revenue from music streaming has grown. Songwriter catalogs have been commanding sale prices that amount to 10 to 18 times their annual royalties, compared with eight to 13 times in earlier years, according to people involved in the deals. Fleetwood Mac’s Stevie Nicks last month closed a deal to sell a majority stake in her publishing catalog, valuing it at $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />“By bringing to UMG the vast and brilliant Dylan songwriting catalog, in an instant, we have forever transformed the legacy of this company,” said Universal Chief Executive Lucian Grainge in an email to employees Monday.

Except when the billionaire turns the tables.<br />Patrick Drahi, the Franco-Israeli controlling shareholder of the Altice cable empire, is trying to take his European company private at an opportunistic valuation. This should serve as a warning to investors in  Altice USA ,  Mr. Drahi’s U.S. company: There is little to stop the same thing happening to them.<br />Mr. Drahi launched his offer for the shares he doesn’t already own in  Altice Europe  in September. The price was €4.11—a 23.8% premium to the previous close, a press release noted. But the share price was as high as €6.74 in February. European telecom companies haven’t escaped the Covid-19 crisis, and Altice Europe stock fell farther than most because of its high leverage.<br />True, the deal’s earnings multiple is ahead of where Europe’s former state telecom monopolies are trading in a deeply depressed sector. More pertinently, though, it is well behind those of transactions done in recent years by Altice Europe’s closest peer:  Liberty Global ,  the European investment vehicle of U.S. cable entrepreneur John Malone, who helped inspire the Altice ventures.<br />Still, Mr. Drahi owns 77.58% of Altice Europe, giving him substantial sway with its management. Having persuaded them that €4.11 is a fair price, the question is whether he even needs to convince minority shareholders. The Netherlands, where the company is listed, has a famously flexible corporate-governance regime.</td>

Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee.<br />“These regulations let megacorporations choose how they want to be taxed,” he said. “They could take the massive tax cut Republicans gave them, or they could take an even bigger tax cut the Treasury Department pulled out of thin air.”<br />If Democrats don’t take control of the Senate after Georgia’s runoff elections in January, regulatory changes present the clearest paths to one of President-elect Joe Biden’s campaign promises: higher taxes on U.S. companies’ foreign operations.<br />The Biden transition team declined to comment. It would likely take months for the new administration to hire Treasury Department officials, make a decision and follow the procedures needed to revise or repeal the regulation.</td>

The premium, which was introduced last year, is set to take effect in the 2020-2021 growing season.<br />The producers include representatives of the cocoa industries in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which sell around 61% of the world’s cocoa supply, according to data from the International Cocoa Organization. “In breach of faith, some chocolatiers and trade houses have adopted covert strategies to circumvent the farmer income improvement mechanism with the aim of collapsing it,” they said in a recent statement.<br />A spokeswoman for Mars said the company wasn’t trying to circumvent the cocoa premium. “Mars Wrigley categorically disagrees with any allegation that it has changed its cocoa-buying practices to avoid payment of the [living income differential],” she said.<br />A spokesman for Hershey said the company doesn’t comment on specific details of purchases, but Hershey sometimes bases its decisions “on hedging pricing fluctuations in the market and…ensuring sufficient supply to meet our needs well into the future, especially in times of uncertainty.”</td>

      <td></td>
      <td>If the Federal Reserve wants to get inflation to meet its target, the central bank’s already historically large balance sheet may need to get much bigger at some point.<br />Speaking with reporters Friday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans addressed why the Fed has failed to sustainably achieve a 2% annual rise in inflation since adopting that goal in 2012. This failure drove the central bank to overhaul its policy-making regime and say it will now explicitly allow inflation to overshoot 2% to make up for...</td>

      <td>As volatility hurts many investing strategies, a few of the smallest funds are putting up some of the biggest returns</td>
      <td>Hedge funds are trailing the U.S. stock market this year. Some of the smallest funds are emerging as some of the best performers, driving greater demand for these types of managers.<br />Funds with less than $1 billion in assets are benefiting from their more manageable portfolios. They can dart in and out of holdings to protect gains or minimize losses amid the market volatility that has characterized this year. They also get more bang for their buck—making investments that require less firepower to affect their overall performance.<br />Among little funds putting up big numbers: London-based Alanda Capital Management Ltd., which manages less than $500 million and gained about 53% through November. Founder Christian Vogel-Claussen said his fund’s competitive edge comes from having a concentrated portfolio built by data science and fundamental research. The portfolio, which includes technology and consumer holdings, typically comprises 15 bets that stocks will rise and the same number of wagers on stocks falling.<br />“We want to be the nimble speedboat,” Mr. Vogel-Claussen said.<br />That agility is in demand today. Some investors were too nervous between March and June to take chances on small funds they hadn’t done due diligence on. But as they acclimated to Zoom and as lockdowns lifted, they became more confident, according to Murano, a firm that connects institutional investors with fund managers. Requests for boutique managers rose 22% in the third quarter from a year earlier.</td>
