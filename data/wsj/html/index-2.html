      <td>Average daily trading volume on Tradeweb’s online bond trading platform topped $1 trillion in January</td>
      <td>A busy start to the year in bond trading has led to record volatility at electronic marketplaces.<br />Average daily trading volume on  Tradeweb Markets Inc.’s  online bond-trading platform topped $1 trillion in January, the company said Thursday. That marks the busiest month on record, beating March 2020 when plunging stock markets pushed investors into the relative safety of government debt. Tradeweb is one of the largest electronic marketplaces for Treasurys.<br />Other firms are also seeing a surge in trading. On Tuesday, competitor  MarketAxess Holdings Inc.  reported average daily trading volume on its online credit trading platform at a record $12.4 billion in January, exceeding last March.<br />The pickup in trading volumes is notable because it follows a banner year for electronic bond-trading platforms. Tradeweb and MarketAxess both experienced the highest yearly trading volumes ever in 2020, helping each company gain market share and post record revenue.<br />“We have so many of our clients still working remotely. This behavioral change has been an accelerant for the move to an electronic trading environment in fixed income,” said Lee Olesky, Tradeweb’s chief executive.</td>

      <td>Volvo said electric vehicles made up more than a third of the company’s new car sales in the European Union, which has roared past China as the world’s biggest plug-in market.<br />Volvo Cars, the Swedish auto maker owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, was one of the first well-known Western brands to shift its focus to making electric cars, at the expense of the internal combustion engine. Others have joined the fray, including Volkswagen AG  and, last week, General Motors Corp.<br />That tilt is now paying off on Volvo’s home turf, where the strategy coincided with an aggressive push by EU officials to promote EVs. After early skepticism, European car buyers are warming up.<br />Håkan Samuelsson, Volvo’s chief executive, said Thursday the company is on track to shift half of its sales to fully electric vehicles by 2025. Volvo launched its first battery electric car last year, the XC40 compact SUV, and plans to launch another fully electric car this year.<br />The company said it sold 115,436 plug-in electric cars world-wide last year, about 17% of its total sales of 661,713 vehicles. In Europe, plug-ins accounted for 36% of total sales in the second half and 31% for the full year, driven by sales of the XC40 battery electric model, and the XC60 and V60 plug-in vehicles.</td>

And both have done exactly that online and offline. Without Section 230 and its common-sense liability protections, the internet would likely become a one-size-fits-all cesspool. It would leave Americans with either an anything-goes, Wild West of an internet or an internet where aggressively moderated websites permit virtually nothing.<br />Section 230 prevents these dystopian outcomes. The law empowers platforms to compete for users by creating a variety of forums—from kid-safe and family-friendly to the more provocative and disturbing. It gives small businesses the chance to meaningfully compete against larger companies by saving them from the threat of devastating legal fees. That means Section 230 fosters a competitive internet where all users can engage in forums that best meet their unique needs.<br />Trace Mitchell<br />NetChoice<br />Washington</td>

      <td>As a Protestant Christian for decades, I found nothing familiar in the description of the Christian view of work in David Skeel’s review of “Religion and the Rise of Capitalism” by Benjamin M. Friedman (Books, Jan. 30). I have always been taught that the Christian view of work is based on the doctrine of vocation. Martin Luther, studying scripture, came to realize that, while the work of the priesthood is of vital importance, the work of ordinary believers had a dignity of its own which is also honored, and those in ordained offices should not be viewed as being on a higher plane than secular professions and family life. Luther wrote in a 1522 sermon: “When a prince sees his neighbor oppressed, he should think: That concerns me! I must protect and shield my neighbor. . . . The same is true for the shoemaker, tailor, scribe, or reader. If he is a Christian tailor, he will say: I make these clothes because God has bidden me do so, so that I can earn a living, so that I can help and serve my neighbor.”<br />The scriptural basis for this is summarized in Colossians 3:23-24 which says, whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.<br />Matthew Henry (1662-1714) wrote regarding this passage: “It sanctifies a servant’s work when it is done as unto God—with an eye to his glory and in obedience to his command, and not merely as unto men, or with regard to them only.”<br />Duncan Merritt<br />Vestavia Hills, Ala.</td>

She cites his 1800 letter to Benjamin Rush as evidence of Jefferson’s commitment to “the freedom of religion established in the First Amendment.” Jefferson was indeed passionate about religious freedom, as his letter to Rush shows, but he never thought the First Amendment “established” that freedom. Like his friend James Madison, who wrote the First Amendment, Jefferson understood religious freedom as among those natural rights that governments are formed to secure, not to establish. The founders believed that the right itself pre-existed the Constitution and, as an unalienable endowment of the creator, pre-existed government itself.<br />David Collins<br />Chicago</td>

Consumer advocacy groups have reached similar conclusions in recent years.<br />(Read a Q&A on heavy metals in baby foods and the congressional report)<br />These heavy metals naturally occur in soil and water. Baby food makers say that their products contain these metals at levels that are safe and that they are already working at reducing their presence by looking for new suppliers and cultivation methods.<br />The Democratic majority of the subcommittee says the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates food safety, should mandate maximum levels of these metals for baby food. Exposure to heavy metals in food can be harmful to brain development in children, according to the FDA, but the extent of potential harm from the levels found in baby foods is unclear. The agency has set voluntary guidance for how much arsenic or lead can be in some foods.</td>

      <td>Democrats are calling for broad distribution, while Republicans have proposed a more-targeted approach</td>
      <td>Republicans have called for a more-targeted approach to a third round of stimulus checks, while Democrats have argued that broad distribution is necessary to cover gaps in other federal programs. Here is a look at the proposals, which differ both on the size of the payment and in who is eligible.<br />President Biden has proposed checks of $1,400 per person as part of his $1.9 trillion aid plan, effectively topping up the $600 payments from December to $2,000. Democrats promised that amount during the Senate campaigns in Georgia that gave them the majority, and Mr. Biden has shown no signs of budging on that.<br />The Biden proposal didn’t specify the income levels at which the checks would start shrinking, and officials said they were open to discussions on that. In the past rounds, the payments began shrinking once adjusted gross income reached $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples. But Democrats in recent days have talked about setting those levels at $50,000 and $100,000.<br />A group of 10 Senate Republicans has proposed scaling back the checks to $1,000 per adult and $500 per dependent adult and child. The Republican plan would reduce the size of the checks for individuals making $40,000 a year or more and phase them out entirely when income reaches $50,000. Married couples with a joint annual income above $80,000 would see smaller checks, going to zero when income reaches $100,000. The plan didn’t specify the phaseout rules for households with children.<br />The proposals mean that a married couple with two children would receive up to $5,600 from the Democratic plan and $3,000 from the GOP alternative. The Republicans estimate their proposal for the checks would cost $220 billion, less than half the cost of the Democratic plan that the House passed in December.</td>

      <td>In France’s Oscar entry, Martine Chevallier and Barbara Sukowa play closeted lovers looking forward to a new life together.</td>
      <td>‘Two of Us,” France’s Oscar entry, is set mainly in a quiet residential neighborhood in southern France—the unspecified locale is Montpellier and its environs. But the story plays out on a shifting border between grand amour and amour fou—a passion burns steadfastly bright while desperation opens the door to madness. And physical doors keep opening and closing; it’s as if a modern-day Feydeau had turned from farce to romance and impending tragedy. This debut film by Filippo Meneghetti, streaming on major digital platforms, is elevated by the beauty of its performances, and by its masterly technique, which would suggest a filmmaker at the height of his career, not someone directing his first feature. Most remarkably, though, the drama captures the timeless essence of unconditional, all-consuming love through a pair of unlikely heroines, two women in their 70s who maintain separate apartments across the hall from each other.<br />They met decades ago in Rome and have lived in France ever since, lesbian lovers still awkwardly and affectingly closeted because one of them, Madeleine (Martine Chevallier), could never bring herself to break away from her husband and family. Now, after the recent death of Mado’s husband, she and her partner, Nina, a Berliner by birth played by the distinguished German star Barbara Sukowa, have plans for a bright future—leaving France and living the life they’ve always dreamed of, together in Rome. (The film, in French with English subtitles, was originally called “Deux,” a better title that bespeaks the strength of their bond.) But Mado suffers a failure of courage, followed by a stroke that leaves her paralyzed, unable to speak and dependent on a caregiver who sees Nina only as the next-door neighbor, not her charge’s surpassingly significant other. Romance devolves into obsession, devotion into horror, as Mado grows increasingly isolated and Nina fights for every opportunity to be close to the woman she loves.<br />When movies are as memorable as this one, it’s seldom because the plot is stunningly original. Elements of this story have come forth in various combinations over the past few years. What gives “Two of Us” its singular power is the hurtling urgency of the storytelling and the brilliance of the acting. Mr. Meneghetti and his script collaborators, Malysone Bovorasmy and Florence Vignon, hedge no bets, observe no constraints. For the caregiver, Muriel, a drab yet paradoxically vivid woman played by Muriel Bénazéraf, Nina becomes an adversary in an undeclared custody battle. For Mado’s daughter Anne (Léa Drucker) and son, Frédéric (Jérôme Varanfrain), their mother’s friend and neighbor is inexplicably intrusive. (The siblings’ naiveté may seem equally inexplicable as described, but it’s believable as dramatized.) For Nina, meanwhile, proximity to Mado is nothing less than a matter of life or death.<br />Which is how the actress plays it. In the radiance of her youth Ms. Sukowa was the protégée and muse of the German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and later the star of hard-edged political films by Margarethe von Trotta. Her performance here is fearless, to say the least; it’s also fevered, frightening and transcendent, with no concern for clear boundaries, just as Nina’s behavior is, by turns, selfless, selfish, admirable, reckless and self-destructive. (Depending on the scene, the superb cinematographer Aurélien Marra makes Ms. Sukowa look shockingly haggard or startlingly beautiful; the truth of the moment trumps the aesthetics.)<br />And one great performance is reflected, and complemented, by another. Ms. Chevallier’s portrayal of Mado, so full of life at the outset, becomes of necessity a study in mysterious nuance. In Mado’s diminished state, how well does she understand what’s happening to her? What is she feeling as she sits in her wheelchair, gazing into an unfathomable mid-distance?</td>

      <td>FBI Agent Clarice Starling returns in a new CBS series.</td>
      <td>It would be best to temper any expectation of a horrorfest to come in “Clarice,” despite the title character’s prominent role in the Thomas Harris novels “The Silence of the Lambs” (1988) and “Hannibal” (1999), not to mention the 1991 “Silence” film starring Jodie Foster as FBI agent Clarice Starling. All the drama of this sharply written new tale is focused devotedly on Clarice, now portrayed with heart and intelligence by Rebecca Breeds.<br />Borne up by wit and an undeniable emotional punch, the CBS series has its beginnings in the early 1990s—roughly a year after the terrors that occurred in “The Silence of the Lambs.” Agent Starling—who had, many months earlier, rescued a young woman imprisoned in the basement of the monstrous predator known as Buffalo Bill—now finds herself the recipient of an urgent message from that young woman’s mother, Ruth Martin. Who, as it happens, holds the position of attorney general. The attorney general (an electrifying Jayne Atkinson) urges Agent Starling to join up with the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program, or Vicap (an actual FBI program). She’s needed to help solve the case of three new serial killings.<br />It’s not a surprising request. Clarice has, as she regularly proves, unique gifts as a crime analyst. One scene has her noting the psychological pretensions of one murderer. The killer was desperate to leave proof that he was impassioned, a man on fire, when in fact, Agent Starling concludes, he was “cold as hell. The wounds he made shows it.”<br />Starling will turn her attention to those three serial killings, but not without dismay. On no subject is she more opposed to the views of her superiors than in the matter of serial killers—which is the instantly agreed upon official answer when any mysterious murder takes place. This is intolerable to Clarice, who believes in much more detailed consideration of the evidence, and who is ever skeptical of received wisdom. She is, as well, unworried about contradicting others—whether her fellow agents or her FBI superiors. It’s the FBI superiors who give her trouble, but she’s been told more than once that her fellow FBI agents aren’t fond of her either—information that fails to trouble her. In this decidedly confident and glamorous character—the product of a far from idyllic childhood who has endured the most harrowing of experiences at the hands of psychopathic killers—the series has its social commentator: the one who understands the motives for everything going on. She’s quick to figure out, for instance, that the reason officials in the agency jump to the conclusion that the latest murder is the work of a serial killer has something to do with the attention the subject brings. It’s sensational news—the kind that attracts the press.<br />No event in the story available thus far (just three of the 13 episodes were provided for review) showed more potential for the sensational than the one in which Clarice and her FBI colleagues have to do battle with rogue militia types who make it entirely clear that they don’t recognize the authority of the U.S. government. Here they are also guilty of shooting a federal officer. The series takes considerable notice of the history of anti-government insurgents. There’s mention of Waco, Texas—site of the 1993 siege that lasted nearly two months at the compound of the Branch Davidians, a struggle that involved ATF agents, the U.S. military and Texas law enforcement, and ended with a toll of nearly 80. The mention of Waco is raised as a kind of warning and a pledge—whatever action the FBI of this series undertakes, it must not result in another Waco.</td>

      <td>A newlywed couple fears the worst in a pandemic that wipes people’s memories.</td>
      <td>The next-to-best reason to watch “Little Fish” (in theaters and streaming on demand) is that it’s an oddity—a small-scale film about a pandemic that finished shooting more than eight months before Covid-19 hit. The best reason, to be explored in a moment, is that it’s a really good movie. (Chad Hartigan was the director. Mattson Tomlin adapted the screenplay from a short story by Aja Gabel.)<br />In the fictional pandemic, a malady called NIA—neuro-inflammatory affliction—takes people’s memories, not their lives. One could argue, and the film does, that losing the former is as bad as losing the latter, but the emphasis at first is on the spread of the disease. A pilot forgets how to fly. A marathon runner forgets to stop running. A bus driver stops his bus, gets out and wanders off; he’s forgotten why he was sitting behind the wheel. Many of the resonances with our present circumstances are eerie: a frightened populace, learning to wear masks; the emergence of quack cures followed by conspiracy theories, one of which contends that the government has a real cure but is spreading NIA in order to limit personal freedom.<br />At the center of the encroaching chaos are newlyweds Emma (Olivia Cooke) and Jude (Jack O’Connell). She’s bright and lively, a veterinarian with a scientific bent. He is younger than his years, an earnest and tender musician who’s been pulling himself together after having put himself through hard times. They’re instantly likable, not least because they’re played by exceptional actors. In 2015 Ms. Cooke was Rachel, the terminally ill high-school student in “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” a lovely film you should see if you haven’t already, or see again if you have. Mr. O’Connell gave one astonishing performance in the 2013 prison drama “Starred Up,” then another, a year later, in “’71”; he played a bewildered young British soldier left behind in a botched attempt to control a street riot in Northern Ireland.<br />The dramatic strategy in “Little Fish” is a smart one. Working with a modest budget, the filmmakers have used the microcosm of a relationship to reflect the larger subject of the pandemic—echoes of “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” in counterpoint to a sort of “Invasion of the Memory Snatchers.”<br />Yet the result is better than smart, it’s stirring. With the NIA pandemic as a pretext, the essential subject becomes memory—its fragility, its wondrousness, its centrality to our existence as sentient beings. When Jude can’t recall what happened on their wedding day, both he and Emma instantly sense incipient tragedy. Who will he be—who will they be—if they can live only in the present tense? In one way “Little Fish” is just the latest addition to a growing genre, films about memory loss due to Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia. What makes it especially poignant, though, is the relative youth of its main characters. Emma and Jude don’t have long lives to look back on, vast arrays of experiences to savor. But the memories they cherish, and share, are no less precious for being limited in number. That’s all they’ve got. They are what they remember.</td>

A deeply affecting deadpan comedy from Iceland, the film, written and directed by Grímur Hákonarson, follows the lives of two sheep-farmer brothers, Gummi and Kiddi, who live on adjacent properties but haven’t spoken to each other for 40 years. The rest is not silence. When disease suddenly threatens their respective flocks, the brothers grapple with their existential crisis eccentrically but heroically.<br />Now a remake from Australia is upon us, playing in theaters and streaming on demand. It’s still called “Rams,” and the change in geography makes perfect sense, the Australian sheep-farming industry being a huge one. (The film is set in the arid vastness of Western Australia, east of Perth.) The basic plot is the same, with adjustments made for culture and temperament. One of the brothers, now called Les, is played appealingly by Michael Caton. The other, Colin, is played by Sam Neill, who by this time qualifies as one of Australia’s national treasures.<br />So far so good, and the fate of the sheep is just as heartbreaking as it was in Iceland. (Their eyes could melt the hardest hearts.) But the director, Jeremy Sims, and the writer, Jules Duncan, have no gift for, or interest in, comedic nuance. The first warning sign comes in the person of a government agent who shows up to enforce a death sentence decreed by the local department of agriculture; he’s a caricature of a bureaucrat, and a tedious nitwit. Mr. Neill struggles with the film’s laggardly pacing—not for long, since he’s a canny veteran with a trusty bag of tricks, but long enough to remind you that stars are as vulnerable to clumsy direction as anyone else. (Miranda Richardson is a pleasing but intermittent presence as an English veterinarian, working for the government, who finds Colin as attractive as he is elusive.)<br />This remake isn’t terrible, just tentative and too long by at least 40 minutes. That’s due to a climate-change subplot in which raging fires threaten to destroy everything in their path, meaning the town as well as the farms that surround it. The idea may have made perfect sense to the filmmakers; Australia has suffered terribly from recent fires. But the more the night is illuminated by flames, and the sun is obscured by smoke, the more you miss those sheep, with their formidable horns and sweet faces.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Hunter Biden, the son of President Biden whose overseas business ties received intense scrutiny from Republicans during the 2020 campaign, plans to release a memoir this spring.<br />The book, “Beautiful Things,” will be released April 6 and focus on his “descent into substance abuse and his tortuous path to sobriety,” Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, announced Thursday. The publisher didn’t release financial terms of the book.<br />Hunter Biden kept a relatively low profile during the presidential campaign, then appeared prominently at his father’s side when he declared victory and again on Inauguration Day. The release of his book is likely to return him further to the public spotlight.<br />The younger Mr. Biden, who turned 51 on Thursday, is an attorney and businessman. His service on the board of a Ukrainian energy during and after his father’s tenure as vice president has drawn wide criticism and was a central issue in the first impeachment of President Donald Trump. He faces a federal criminal tax investigation, for which he has denied any wrongdoing, and has drawn scrutiny for his business dealings with European and Chinese tycoons, some of whom were eager to be associated with the Biden family name.<br />The Wall Street Journal first reported in Sept. 2019 that Mr. Trump had repeatedly pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden, saying that he was engaged in corrupt activities. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump and his allies argued that Joe Biden, while vice president, had sought the removal of Ukraine’s top prosecutor to protect the gas company, Burisma Holdings, from investigation.</td>

The Interior Department said Thursday it would put implementation on hold for at least three weeks while the agency takes public comments.<br />“The Migratory Bird Treaty Act is a bedrock environmental law critical to protecting migratory birds and restoring declining bird populations,” Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said. “The Trump administration sought to overturn decades of bipartisan and international precedent in order to protect corporate polluters.”<br />In seeking to end the criminal penalties, the Trump administration was responding to business groups, farmers and others who said criminal penalties were too harsh for accidental deaths.<br />Environmentalists argued that the penalties were needed to encourage farmers, power companies and others to take greater precautions to protect birds.</td>

      <td>Extra-virgin olive oil...grapeseed oil...sesame oil? Depends on how you use it. For frying, sautéing, dressings and more, these bottles are beauties.</td>
      <td>TURNS OUT even an ingredient that seems pretty basic can lead you down a rabbit hole. Take cooking oil. Some types are better for high-heat cooking; others are ruined by high temperatures, losing their delicate flavors and even turning rancid. What should you use and when? Here’s your guide.<br />The smoke point is the temperature at which oil will smoke and break down into free fatty acids. Refined oils, stripped of impurities and volatile compounds, have higher smoke points while virgin or raw oils burn more easily, said Harold McGee, author of the seminal “On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen.” A refined olive oil (often labeled “light”) has a smoke point of 485 degrees, while extra virgin’s is 410 degrees.<br />Oil heated past its smoke point may give food a bitter flavor, and some studies suggest it can be unhealthy. Still, these dangers are often overstated for home cooks: You’d have to inhale a lot of smoke and ingest a lot of oil to suffer toxic consequences. So consider smoke points but, for most cooking, let flavor and price be your guide. And no matter which oil you choose, store it in a cool, dark place.<br />Extracted from the pits of wine grapes, grapeseed oil has a clean, neutral flavor and a high smoke point (between 400 and 420 degrees) that make it extremely versatile. Use it for searing, frying, baking and for dressings where you don’t want the oil to outshine other ingredients. One to try: La Tourangelle Grapeseed Oil, $6 for 16.9 ounces, amazon.com<br />Conventional wisdom says this oil has too low a smoke point for high-heat cooking. But according to the International Olive Council, extra-virgin olive oil has a smoke point of 410 degrees, plenty high to sauté vegetables or meat. That said, save the highest quality oils for poaching, dressings or drizzling. Look for a harvest date——stored properly, a good oil can last about two years—and dark bottles or opaque tins, as sunlight will cause the oil to degrade. One to try: Olio Piro, $59 for a 16.9 ounces, olio-piro.com</td>

Passing the budget resolution will move Democrats forward with reconciliation, a process that allows the Senate to pass legislation with a simple majority. The House approved the budget resolution Wednesday.<br />Because the budget is nonbinding and never becomes law, the amendment votes are largely symbolic, a factor that can influence how much support they receive. Republicans are planning amendments that will forbid immigrants without a permanent legal status to receive direct payments, cut federal funding to states that have an active investigation into underreported deaths in nursing homes, and block aid for schools that don’t reopen after teachers have had the opportunity to be vaccinated.<br />New York Democratic Gov.

      <td>THE COVID-19 VACCINES have arrived. Does this mean we’ll soon be free to roam the world, guilt- and hassle-free? The short answer is no. While an inoculation protects you from getting sick, it’s not yet known whether the vaccines will prevent an asymptomatic person from passing the virus to others. The shots “are extraordinarily good at preventing symptoms if you contract the virus, but we don’t know if you can still spread the virus after vaccination,” said Matt McCarthy, associate professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.<br />Medical experts say that it will take months to reach the herd immunity—which some estimates put at 70% to 80% of the population—that will allow normal life to resume, much less normal travel. Most vaccines require two doses several weeks apart, and another month for the full benefits to kick in, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Bottom line: You’ll still need to follow guidelines on mask use, social distancing and Covid testing if you want to get out of Dodge.<br />Meanwhile, look for “immunity passports” to become the latest travel accessory, as tourist destinations gear up to reopen. United,  Lufthansa ,   JetBlue  and other airlines are already backing an app called Common Pass that allows carriers to verify your test results and vaccine status. The International Air Transport Association is testing a similar Travel Pass with  British Airways ,  Emirates airline, Singapore Air and several other carriers.<br />Australia on your bucket list? Flagship carrier  Qantas ,  which has been partially grounded since last March, plans to ramp up long-distance flights later this year but it’s considering only allowing passengers who can show proof of a Covid inoculation.<br />So, a vaccine passport might not be your Get Out of Jail Free card anytime soon. It’s “a nice idea but there are many logistic hurdles,” said Dr. McCarthy. “If someone was vaccinated in January, will they be immune in August? We don’t know.”</td>

Mrs. Greene said she realized in 2018 that she was receiving misinformation and stopped believing it.<br />“I was allowed to believe things that weren’t true and I would ask questions about them and talk about them and that is absolutely what I regret,” she said Thursday, wearing a “Free Speech” mask. “If it weren’t for the  Facebook  posts and comments that I liked in 2018, I wouldn’t be standing here today and you couldn’t point a finger and accuse me of anything wrong, because I’ve lived a very good life that I’m proud of.”<br />Democrats criticized Mrs. Greene’s speech, saying her remarks fell short of an apology. “It was unpersuasive,” said Rep.

CBP said the Biden administration will continue using what legal authorities it has to keep migrants out of crowded detention facilities during the pandemic.<br />Mexican immigration and foreign ministry officials said Mexico hasn’t ended its practice of accepting all returned migrants, but officials in some stretches of the border have made “adjustments” to accommodate a change in Mexico’s immigration law that bars officials from holding migrant children and their families in detention centers run by the immigration service. Those migrants must now be turned over to the DIF, Mexico’s social-service agency for children and families.<br />“The law says we can’t have minors in immigration centers, they must be taken to shelters run by the DIF, where they wait until their migratory status is defined,” said a spokeswoman for Mexico’s immigration agency.</td>

      <td>Tools for stopping variants are limited, and like masks and distancing, vaccines are not a panacea.</td>
      <td>Each stage of the American Covid-19 pandemic has been marked by a singular public-health message that crowded out all other perspectives. From early calls to “crush the curve” with shutdowns and pleas to stay at home, then to claims that face masks would end the pandemic, these messaging strategies have sowed unrealistic expectations and delayed public acceptance of reality. The most recent message is “universal vaccination,” an aspiration whose unattainability may further delay the country’s return to social and economic normalcy.<br />How did we arrive at this point in the pandemic? The media’s campaign to stoke fear about collapsing health systems, along with their portrayal of severe illness as the inevitable consequence of infection—despite a thousandfold difference in risk between old and young—contributed to an atmosphere of distrust. Animosity toward Donald Trump—justified or not—fueled this campaign. Health officials abetted the discord by abandoning longstanding public-health tenets that emphasize harm reduction and a nonjudgmental outlook. Instead, these experts promoted mandates for the healthy and public shaming of people who strayed from guidelines.<br />Now the fear and distrust have made a substantial proportion of the U.S. population unreceptive to a vaccine. While vaccine receptiveness might be expected to vary based on a person’s risk of illness, a January Gallup survey showed that a stronger predictor is political preference. More than 80% of Democrats are willing to be vaccinated, but only about 45% of Republicans are.<br />The long vaccination lines seen on television will eventually thin as Americans most worried about contracting Covid-19 receive their shots. Many of the estimated 100 million Americans who aren’t interested in vaccination are unlikely to change their decision voluntarily.<br />What also isn’t serving vaccination efforts: the lack of transparent communication from public-health officials that meets people where they are and sincerely acknowledges the concerns of millions who view Covid-19 vaccines with suspicion. Concerns have been dismissed or derided as “misinformation.” It’s true that serious adverse effects appear to be uncommon, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. But responding to these worries by insisting more loudly that the vaccines are safe isn’t an effective strategy. A wiser strategy is to address these concerns with data about what is known, and honesty and humility about areas of uncertainty—such as vaccination in pregnant women.</td>

      <td>AT THIS POINT in the pandemic, even the most committed homebodies are getting itchy feet—and that goes double for people with kids at home.<br />Relief might be on the horizon. If the virus is brought under control over the next several weeks, spring break could be a chance for cooped-up families to escape for a spell. Of course, precautions are still essential, from wearing masks to following local rules to keeping a distance from other people.<br />We found five trips that take some of the stress out of the equation: domestic destinations, all but one driveable, with a focus on the outdoors and activities for everyone in the family. Be sure to read the fine print before booking, in case the world changes (again). If you’re not ready to make the leap, that’s OK—there’s always next year.<br />Hawaii’s strict Covid precautions may make visiting the islands more challenging—but also, arguably, safer. A destination worth the hassle: Mauna Lani, Auberge Resorts Collection, which reopened on serene Big Island last year after a $200-million renovation that brought a modern, organic feel to the property. Family-friendly features include a shallow, protected children’s beach, a sandy-bottomed kids’ pool and a kids’ club. Cultural stewardship is important here—the 32-acre property was an aquaculture site for ancient Hawaiians—and Mauna Lani offers nature walks and workshops in lei-making, ukulele, weaving, among other activities sure to outshine the more pedestrian quarantine pastimes (see: breadmaking). As a bonus, the resort has partnered with an independent testing company to give guests the pre-departure Covid tests that Hawaii requires to avoid a lengthy quarantine.

Tourist traffic is light, snowmelt is pepping up the park’s famous waterfalls, and wildflowers (including California poppies) are abloom. Children 10 and up can take daylong rock-climbing classes in the park (younger kids can do private lessons with an adult). In 2019, AutoCamp opened about 40 minutes away from the park’s Arch Rock Entrance. It offers custom, 31-foot Airstreams that can sleep a family of four, fully furnished canvas tents, or a combination of the two—including a mini suite with a trailer and a separate kids’ tent.

He admitted cutting and pasting client signatures to divert money and make stock  bets without their knowledge, causing more than $150 million in losses, according to the Geneva criminal court.<br />The regulator, Finma, publicly censured Credit Suisse in 2018 for inadequately supervising and disciplining Mr. Lescaudron as a top earner, and said he had repeatedly broken internal rules, but it revealed little else about the bank’s actions in the matter. Credit Suisse said it discovered Mr. Lescaudron’s fraud in September 2015 when a stock he had bought for clients crashed.<br />However, the report, commissioned by Finma in 2016 and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, found Mr. Lescaudron’s activities triggered hundreds of alerts in the bank that weren’t fully probed in the 2009-15 period studied. In addition, around a dozen executives or managers in Credit Suisse’s private bank knew Mr. Lescaudron was repeatedly breaking rules but turned a blind eye, proposed lenient punishment for his misconduct or otherwise glossed over the issues because he brought in around $25 million in revenue a year, the report found.<br />It said Mr. Lescaudron’s “disregard of internal directives and guidelines, the inadequate safeguarding of client documentation as well as unauthorized settlements of client transactions had been known to the bank since June 2011.”</td>

      <td>YOU’LL READ the title of this cocktail recipe, see that it has ginger and turmeric and lemon in it, and think you know why I’m calling it healthy.<br />And you’ll be right. For thousands of years, people have used ginger to treat colds, arthritis, even migraines, and modern clinical research bears this out: Ginger has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; it can alleviate symptoms of nausea and aid cardiovascular function. Turmeric, ginger’s plant-family cousin, contains curcurmin, also a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. Lemons are a good source of vitamin C, cayenne pepper can help with digestion, unfiltered apple cider vinegar contains helpful bacteria, and honey is just delicious. The drink’s creator, Jim Meehan, calls it “a post snow-shoveling cocktail” and says it was loosely inspired by the Master Cleanse.<br />You’ll also note that there are no spirits in this drink. I’m not anti-alcohol, but there are benefits to taking breaks or otherwise moderating your intake. But there’s a less obvious benefit to consider, too.<br />Before making the Get Well Soon I hadn’t worked with turmeric root, which imparts an earthy, woodsy flavor and an incandescent carrot hue. Honestly, it’s difficult to peel and stains everything it touches, but even these are good reasons to use it. According to neuroscientist David Eagleman, when we face new tasks, especially frustrating ones, we build new pathways in our neural networks. “The best thing we can do as we get older is to keep challenging ourselves,” he said on Brené Brown’s “Unlocking Us” podcast.<br />And, hey, if you put in the work, you might even enjoy your drink more. “The IKEA Effect,” a 2011 study published by researchers from Harvard Business School, Tulane University and Duke University, showed that when participants assembled IKEA boxes, folded origami or built sets of Legos themselves, they valued the end product more highly than when others did the work. And effort without completion did not increase valuation, so stick with it, all the way down to the clove-studded lemon-wheel garnish. It’ll be good for you.</td>

      <td>New York Times Co.  said 2020 was a record year for digital-subscription growth but the publisher posted flat fourth-quarter revenue, partly reflecting continued declines in advertising revenue during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The company said it added 2.3 million net digital subscribers last year, which Chief Executive Meredith Kopit Levien called “an outlier year for net subscription additions” during an investor call Thursday.<br />In the fourth quarter, the Times added 627,000 net new digital subscriptions compared with 393,000 in the third, the company said. Of those, 425,000 signed up to the paper’s core news offering and 202,000 for lower-cost digital products such as its cooking and crossword apps.<br />Ms. Kopit Levien said the company reached two milestones last year: Digital revenue overtook print revenue, and revenue from digital subscriptions became the publisher’s largest revenue stream. “Those two milestones,” she said in a news release, “mark the end of the first decade of The Times’s transformation into a digital-first, subscription-first company.”<br />Fourth-quarter revenue was basically flat, rising 0.2% to $509.4 million. Subscription revenue increased 15% to $315.8 million, but advertising revenue fell 19% to $139.3 million and other revenues decreased 12% to $54.3 million reflecting fewer episodes of its television series, and lower contributions from live events and commercial printing. Those declines were partially offset by higher affiliate referral revenue from Wirecutter, the company’s product-review website.</td>

      <td>After a huge 2020 for digital spending PayPal has momentum in a new realm, in-store payments</td>
      <td>PayPal Holdings  is breaking into stores across America.<br />For years, investors wondered if the digital-payment giant would cross over into the physical realm in a big way. The pandemic, which has been a boon for contactless tapped or scanned payments, seems to have gotten that ball rolling.  PayPal  on Wednesday said its payments with QR codes—digital scrambles that can be displayed by phones and scanned at checkout counters—are now accepted at more than 600,000 retail locations, and that in 2020 it had signed up 29 large enterprises such as  CVS  and  Macy’s  to offer them. PayPal did more than $20 billion worth of in-store volume across its payment types in 2020.<br />That is just a small piece of the nearly $1 trillion in total payment volume PayPal did last year—but it is important volume for investors to track. For one, volume growth in a new arena will be vital as PayPal tries to sustain the momentum built by the pandemic’s behavioral shift to digital spending. PayPal recorded 31% currency-neutral total-payment-volume growth in 2020, and says it expects this to slow only somewhat in 2021, to the high 20’s. Prior to the earnings report, analysts were expecting only 24% growth in 2021, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.<br />Plus, in-store transactions are relatively profitable for PayPal. For one, having a viable in-store option apparently pumps more volume through already-acquired users’ accounts: Last year, there was a 19% increase in payment volume for PayPal users who started regularly using QR codes. This helps PayPal more closely embed itself in users’ day-to-day lives, giving it further opportunity to offer its growing list of services, like buy-now-pay-later and bill payments. PayPal’s branded in-store transactions like QR codes also generally have better take rates, or how much of the volume ultimately becomes revenue for PayPal, than many kinds of online payments.<br />Volumes for pent-up digital spending like travel and events may also rebound this year, as consumer habits normalize. To keep surpassing investors’ already-high expectations for the shares, which are up about 110% over the past year, more growth in-store would be a big help.</td>

It is also operating under partisan pressures that, by one measure, are greater than ever.<br />Some 94 senators belong to the party that won their state’s presidential contest in November—a record-high level of party allegiance for at least 54 years, an analysis of data gathered by the Pew Research Center shows. That leaves a record-low six senators as political mismatches with their home state’s presidential choice: Three Democratic senators represent states that backed former President Donald Trump, and three Republicans come from states that President Biden won.<br />Just two weeks since Mr. Biden took office, it remains unclear how the dynamics of the divided Senate will affect his legislative agenda, which includes a proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.<br />With more voters siding with a single party, current and former senators say, it may mean many lawmakers have less flexibility to work with the opposing party to strike deals—a necessity in a chamber where 60 votes are needed to pass most legislation.<br />That presents a potential challenge for Mr. Biden, who has made calls for national unity a central theme of his presidency and has said he wants bipartisan support for his coronavirus response proposal and some other priorities.</td>

      <td>Deutsche Bank  faces a new problem in 2021: higher investor expectations.<br />On Thursday, the German bank reported steady full-year results, buoyed by a stellar performance from its investment bank and lower credit losses. Despite the pandemic, management slightly over-delivered on its three-year transformation plans—a notable success after years of unfulfilled promises.<br />The investment bank capitalized on market volatility and actually gained market share in some businesses. And shareholders weren’t hurt by the European Central Bank’s ban on dividends, as they were at peers, since Deutsche Bank’s 2019 and 2020 dividends were already canceled as part of its turnaround plans.<br />But this year could be very different, as capital markets normalize and the economy is weaned off government-support programs. Although Germany performed relatively well in the first wave of the pandemic, its home-market economy still contracted 5% in 2020 and the country hasn’t been spared in the second wave.<br />Chief executive Christian Sewing highlighted that the bank’s credit losses were “significantly lower” than many peers. The group credits its high proportion of low-risk German mortgages and limited exposure to crisis-impacted sectors. However, ECB officials warned last month that European banks could be underestimating the credit trouble ahead.</td>

      <td>Republicans see political opportunity as teachers’ unions, which support the president, have pushed back on some reopening plans</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden’s pledge to reopen most K-8 schools in his first 100 days is being challenged by new fast-spreading coronavirus strains, a slow vaccination rollout, uncertainty over economic-relief legislation and clashes between state authorities and teachers’ unions.<br />Mr. Biden has made education a top priority and is pushing for more funding for schools to reopen. He and his fellow Democrats enjoy close ties to teachers’ unions, which have pushed back on many reopening plans around the country. And as angst over school closings grows, some Republicans think the issue could give them a political opportunity.<br />Given the federal government’s limited ability to influence the operation of local school districts, which falls chiefly to local and state governments, Mr. Biden’s school-return plan comprises principally of $130 billion in funds for K-12 schools in the $1.9-trillion Covid-aid plan he has proposed to Congress.<br />The money would go to school districts to pay for reducing class sizes to accommodate social distancing, improving ventilation, hiring more janitors and providing more personal protective equipment, according to the proposal. Mr. Biden has also issued an executive order calling for the development of federal guidance for safely reopening schools and is pushing for funding for expanded Covid-19 testing to support schools.<br />The fate of the aid legislation is uncertain, however, given Republican objections about the overall size of the bill and over the inclusion of state and local aid. A competing Covid-aid proposal from a group of 10 Republican senators includes $20 billion for K-12 schools. Democrats are pursuing passing a bill without GOP votes.</td>

Chief Executive Satya Nadella is betting the Covid-19 crisis has spawned demand for digital tools that will outlast the pandemic and says there is a growing appetite for all-encompassing employee management applications that the company is going after.<br />On Thursday, the company unveiled its first set of apps for a new suite of employee management tools, called Viva. The package is designed to offer—in one place—software for human resource functions like payroll, management tools to track employee performance and resources for staff covering benefits, career development and other aspects of their life at work.<br />The pandemic has crystallized for many executives that being able to manage their staff and keep them engaged even during difficult times is critical, Mr. Nadella said in an interview.<br />“From a priority perspective, empowering your people with the very best tools and systems so that they can work in spite of whatever the constraints,” he said. “I don’t think anyone’s going to say, this is a nice to have. In fact it’s essential.”<br />The tools are also one way Microsoft is trying to extend a yearlong earnings boom it has enjoyed during the pandemic as customers spent heavily on cloud-computing tools, laptops and videogames. Mr. Nadella said he expects spending on technology, currently at about 5% of gross domestic product, will continue to accelerate after the pandemic.</td>

House and Senate leaders took steps this week to begin a process, known as reconciliation, that would allow them to pass a measure with a simple majority vote in the Senate—rather than the 60 votes required for most Senate legislation.</td>

      <td>Daimler’s shareholder-friendly decision to split its car and truck divisions will be hard for Germany’s largest car maker to ignore</td>
      <td>Germany is slowly becoming more welcoming to stock investors. If Daimler and  Siemens  can shake off the old obsession with scale, even change at  Volkswagen  may not be too much to hope for.<br />Late on Wednesday, automotive group Daimler said it will split in two, separating its flagship  Mercedes-Benz  car division from its often-overlooked truck unit—the global leader in big rigs thanks to Freightliner and other brands. The move wasn’t a huge surprise after years of rumors and preparations. But the decision to finally press the button couldn’t be taken for granted at a company that embodies the German industrial tradition, and the structure of the deal was more shareholder-friendly than expected. Shares have risen 8% since the announcement.<br />The case for a split is the classic one against conglomerates: Heavy trucks and cars don’t have much in common, and separate stock-market listings will focus management and release trapped value for shareholders. This was particularly obvious for Daimler because each of the two units has a close peer— BMW  for Mercedes-Benz and  Volvo  AB for Daimler Trucks—that usually make better margins and fetch higher valuations.<br />Crucially, Daimler is distributing a “significant majority” of stock in its truck business to its shareholders, rather than planning an initial public offering. In 2019, Volkswagen went down the IPO route with its own truck spinoff,  Traton ,  only to create a company with very limited stock-market liquidity in which it still owns a majority stake. Daimler has learnt the lesson.<br />It has perhaps also learned from Siemens, another German industrial icon that has slimmed down in recent years by selling or spinning off businesses. The strategy became the leitmotif of former chief executive Joe Kaeser, who also sits on Daimler’s supervisory board. Mr. Kaeser retired from Siemens on Wednesday with the stock at a record high, in stark contrast to U.S. peer  General Electric .</td>

Cold weather, a surge in Covid-19 case numbers and the threat of a new, highly contagious variant of the virus have contributed to a broader winter slowdown that has hindered the labor market’s recovery, economists say.</td>

Due to coronavirus restrictions, only 200 people were allowed at each location to watch Thursday’s verdict.<br />In the capital Kampala and other towns, people gathered in restaurants and bars to watch Mr. Ongwen listen stoically as the presiding judge, Bertram Schmitt, listed his crimes.

The president, who will be accompanied by Vice President Kamala Harris, is also expected to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and address State Department employees in what will mark his first trip to a cabinet agency since taking office.<br />Former President Donald Trump was largely skeptical of Washington’s post-World War II alliances, seeing NATO members as economic competitors who should pay significantly more for their own defense. He strongly backed Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and vetoed congressional attempts to curb weapon sales to Riyadh.<br />Other actions, such as deals that led Arab countries to recognize Israel, were welcomed by Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Blinken has said Mr. Trump’s overall tough approach to China, which the previous administration targeted for unfair trade practices and what Mr. Trump said was a lack of transparency around the origins of coronavirus, is the right one, even if the Biden administration disagrees about how the policy was implemented.<br />Still, lawmakers in both parties have expressed eagerness to strengthen ties with countries where U.S. relations soured under Mr. Trump, such as Germany and other allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</td>

      <td>The  GameStop  saga rattled a lot of people.<br />Hedge funds who shorted the stock were crushed as it soared 10-fold in five days. New buyers who were sucked in late by the prospect of quick profits then lost horribly, with the stock down 80% from its high. Even those who got in early can’t be happy to see so much of their newfound wealth evaporate. Trust in Wall Street, in the clearing system and in popular broker Robinhood have all been damaged, and opportunistic politicians from left and right have leapt on the moves to support their existing policy positions.<br />Yet, investors might reasonably be reassured by the resilience of the wider market. If that sounds odd, bear with me. Last week the broad selloff by hedge funds as they cut their leverage shook up stocks, with those heavily shorted rallying hard while the rest fell. Volatility jumped. The S&P 500 had its two worst days since October, as the effect of deleveraging was worsened by worries about the knock-on effects if a big hedge fund collapsed.<br />The market became highly sensitive to GameStop. Since the retailer was listed by then-owner Barnes & Noble in 2002, it has tended to move in the same direction as the S&P, with the 100-day correlation in their moves always being positive. Over the 10 days to Tuesday, the stock has moved in the same direction only twice, and the 100-day correlation is now negative. What was good for GameStop was bad for the market, and vice versa.<br />The reason for comfort is that stocks didn’t suffer more. It isn’t so much that we should be relieved that GameStop and the broader coordinated attacks by users of Reddit didn’t bring down a broker or start a chain reaction of hedge-fund failures, although of course that would have been very bad. The good news is that these worries didn’t trigger a significant correction.</td>

      <td>After its spinoff of Match Group and Vimeo, IAC lacks an obvious superstar</td>
      <td>If you blinked recently, you might not recognize IAC/InterActiveCorp’s new lineup. It seems like just yesterday that it was an online dating powerhouse with a call option on home improvement. Today its edge looks less defined.<br />After spinning off online dating giant Match Group Inc.  last year, tech holding company IAC said in December it will also spin off video hosting and sharing platform Vimeo. That company has been a standout performer amid the pandemic, growing revenue by an average of 50% year-over-year for the past seven months, including January, according to preliminary monthly metrics released by IAC on Wednesday. That makes it one of IAC’s best-performing assets, aside from one or two of the smaller companies housed in the company’s “emerging and other” category.<br />So what is left? IAC’s latest scorecard shows it has some rookie prospects but lacks an obvious superstar. The company reported fourth-quarter results on Wednesday that were slightly ahead of Wall Street’s expectations, with revenue growing 27%, up from the 12% growth reported in the third quarter. But January metrics look dicier. IAC’s largest remaining asset,  ANGI Homeservices  makes up 42% of its overall top line. That business has been highly volatile over the past 12 months, posting 21% growth last February compared with a year earlier, declining to 7% in July and to 6% most recently in January. The company attributed ANGI’s most recent performance declines to tough comparisons due to an accounting change and lingering pandemic effects.<br />Those factors haven’t pinched other parts of IAC’s business, at least. Recently acquired Care.com appears to be going strong, as evidenced by the 120% year-over-year revenue growth in IAC’s emerging and other segment in January. And relatively unknown digital media company Dotdash grew revenue 53% last month compared with a year earlier—its highest growth rate on that basis in at least a year. Still, Dotdash’s revenue amounts to less than 10% of IAC’s overall top line, even excluding Vimeo.<br />In IAC’s latest shareholder letter, posted Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Joey Levin reminded investors of the company’s history of building up to pare down, only to rebuild all over again. It is clear from the letter that the company is now soundly in rebuilding mode, but the specific game plan is less apparent. It is certainly part of IAC’s modus operandi to take misunderstood or underappreciated businesses and turn them into stars. Based on recent performance, it is entirely possible that Dotdash and Care.com might fit that bill.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—Australia’s decision to close its borders protected it from the coronavirus. But that policy is wreaking havoc on the country’s universities, which relied on lucrative tuition from foreign students who are stuck overseas.<br />Experts say it will take years for the schools, among the best in the world, to recover from the economic damage. Already, Australian universities have cut more than 17,000 jobs, according to industry group Universities Australia. It said operating revenue fell 4.9% last year and is expected to fall another 5.5% this year.<br />“As students finish and we haven’t got new ones coming, we’re yet to hit the bottom basically,” said Peter Hurley, a policy fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Education and Health Policy, which forecast that the country’s universities could lose up to $15 billion in international tuition through 2023.<br />Leaders all over the world have needed to balance protecting their populations from the virus with the economic damage that those policies can cause. But with a vaccine rollout expected to start in Australia soon, pressure is ramping up on conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison to provide clarity on how and when international students could return.<br />Leaders in the nation’s states and territories have pressed for some places in the quarantine system to be reserved for international students, but Mr. Morrison has argued that returning Australians must come first. Thousands of Australians remain stranded overseas because the government has imposed caps on returning travelers, part of an effort to ease pressure on its hotel quarantine system and to minimize the risk of highly contagious variants of the coronavirus from spreading into the community.</td>

      <td>The North Korean regime has lasted longer than the Soviet Union despite economic hardship, human-rights abuses and sometimes deadly family rivalries</td>
      <td>The Kim family has governed North Korea since Soviet leader Joseph Stalin installed clan patriarch Kim Il Sung as head of state after World War II. To consolidate and maintain power through three generations, the ruling Kims have purged, coaxed or murdered rivals and elites, sometimes even within the family. To deter American-led military action and secure the regime’s longer-term political survival, they have driven the development of nuclear weapons. The family has led the isolated country for more than seven decades—longer than the Soviet Union existed—and remains unchallenged despite widespread poverty, an appalling human-rights record and the pressure of economic sanctions.<br />Kim Jong Un is the third leader of North Korea. He gained power in December 2011, upon the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, who had officially ruled since Kim Il Sung’s death in 1994. Kim Jong Un was just 27 years old when he took the reins, according to the South Korean government, which puts his birth date at Jan. 8, 1984.<br />He had spent much of his life out of the spotlight, in family palaces in Pyongyang and a boarding school in Switzerland, before being catapulted into prominence just 14 months earlier, when his ailing father presented him as his heir apparent during a Workers’ Party event.<br />Little at the time was known about the new leader, thought to be Kim Jong Il’s third son. North Korea experts believe Kim Jong Un was more ambitious and politically acute than his older brothers, spurring their father—himself a first son—to pick him despite his younger age.<br />After inheriting power, Kim Jong Un accelerated development of nuclear weapons, testing more missiles and nuclear bombs than his father and grandfather combined. By 2017, North Korea had a missile that weapons experts said had the range to hit Washington, D.C., though the pursuit left the country awash in economic sanctions.</td>

      <td>Most companies caught in the Reddit-fueled rally don’t mind the extra bump in their share prices. For others, it is a shot in the arm that hurts.</td>
      <td>Individual investors cheering on the Reddit-fueled rally of heavily shorted stocks were out to “eat the rich,” not the companies themselves. In an unfortunate twist of fate and timing, the frenzy could end up taking a bite out of  Bed Bath & Beyond .<br />The culprit is an accelerated share repurchase agreement—known as an ASR—that Bed Bath & Beyond announced well before the Reddit-fueled rally pushed up heavily shorted stocks like the company’s own. Such an agreement exposes the company to the short end of the trade, on the same side as the hedge funds that the day traders were out to deplete. For a heavily shorted stock initiating an ASR, an army of investors out to destroy short sellers can be a truly terrifying scenario.<br />While ASRs are nothing new, the sheer magnitude of stock price surges this past week highlights the potential riskiness of the method.<br />In an ASR, a company buys back shares in one large chunk from a dealer—in Bed Bath & Beyond’s case, it was JPMorgan—that typically will deliver shares it borrowed from institutional investors. The bank must then cover its short position by buying back the company’s shares in the open market over a period. If the share price rises, the company must compensate the bank for the difference between what it paid the bank for the initial share delivery and what the bank paid to buy those shares in the market, typically based on a volume-weighted average price. This difference can be settled either by cash or shares.<br />In some cases, a company will structure an ASR with “collars” or caps on the per-share price it will ultimately have to pay, limiting downside in case share prices spike. In many cases, including Bed Bath & Beyond’s, the agreement is uncollared.  Dollar Tree  and Monsanto are among the companies that have bought back shares using this structure.</td>

On Thursday, it reported a bumper annual profit.<br />Driving the bank’s results was booming activity from clients as they adjusted their needs and investment portfolios.

The initial public offering is the world’s largest in more than a year, according to Dealogic, and gives the company a market value of nearly $61 billion.<br />This is the latest in a string of hot IPOs in Hong Kong, many involving Chinese technology startups or other companies catering to China’s increasingly affluent consumers. Last year, for example, bottled-water group  Nongfu Spring Co.  jumped on its debut, while the abortive dual listing of Ant Group Co. in Shanghai and Hong Kong generated trillions of dollars of demand.<br />Kuaishou earlier priced the stock sale at 115 Hong Kong dollars a share, equivalent to $14.84 a share. Unofficial gray-market pricing Thursday suggested Kuaishou’s stock could leap in value when it starts trading Friday. The stock closed at HK$336.60 a share on a trading platform operated by Futu Securities, almost triple the IPO price.<br />Joe Chang, a manager at an e-commerce company in Shenzhen, said he was allotted just 100 shares after placing an order for 50,000, and that he used borrowed money for 90% of the total. Mr. Chang said he liked the company as a market leader in short video and live-streaming, and because rival ByteDance is unlisted. He said Kuaishou’s market value could rise to $150 billion.</td>

The Beijing Games also face calls for a boycott over Beijing’s handling of Hong Kong and its far western region of Xinjiang.<br />Another problem: the pandemic has shredded the training and competition calendars of aspiring 2022 Winter Olympians. Canceled events include key test events for the Beijing hosts, such as the Grand Prix Final for figure skating that was set to take place in December 2020, but was halted due to countries’ unwillingness to send skaters.</td>

      <td>The Reddit-fueled frenzy in stocks such as  GameStop Corp.  and  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  is prompting calls for regulators to reconsider a decades-old practice in the U.S. stock market: payment for order flow.<br />The practice, in which high-speed trading firms pay brokerages for the right to execute orders submitted by mom-and-pop investors, has long been controversial. Some say it warps the incentives of brokers and encourages them to maximize their revenue at the expense of customers. Supporters, including many brokers and trading firms, say it is misunderstood and helps ensure that investors get seamless executions and good prices on their trades.<br />Either way, it is big money. Last year, brokerages such as  Charles Schwab Corp. , TD Ameritrade, Robinhood Markets Inc. and E*Trade collected nearly $2.6 billion in payments for stock and option orders, according to an analysis of company filings by JMP Securities. The biggest sources of the payments were electronic trading firms such as Citadel Securities, Susquehanna International Group LLP and  Virtu Financial Inc.<br />Payment for order flow helped set the stage for the manic trading in GameStop, whose shares began the year around $18, surged to a record close of $347.51 on Jan. 27 and ended Wednesday’s session at $92.41.<br />That is because payment for order flow made it possible for the U.S. brokerage industry to shift to zero-commission trades in late 2019. No longer needing to pay a fee on stock transactions and empowered by easy-to-use trading apps like Robinhood, individual investors poured into stocks and options at record levels last year. More recently, they snapped up stocks like GameStop that were being touted on Reddit and other social-media platforms.</td>

Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), the incoming head of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, will propose broad changes to U.S. antitrust laws Thursday as the newly Democratic-led Congress begins to press the issue of perceived monopoly power in technology and other industries.<br />The senator plans to introduce legislation that would bar companies that dominate their sectors from making acquisitions unless they can prove their deals don’t “create an appreciable risk of materially lessening competition,” according to a draft from Ms. Klobuchar’s office. Now, the burden is on the government to prove a merger substantially lessens competition.<br />The proposals will likely face headwinds. Republicans didn’t sign on to many of the ideas when Ms. Klobuchar floated them during the previous session of Congress, and businesses including big technology companies are expected to oppose a significant rewriting of antitrust laws.<br />Ms. Klobuchar is hoping that Democrats’ control of the Senate will improve odds of passage, and she will seek to build momentum through a series of legislative hearings focused on monopoly power.<br />“We have an increasing monopoly problem, really headlined by what is happening with tech” but also extending across the economy, Ms. Klobuchar said.  “Our laws have to be as sophisticated as those that are messing around with competition,” she said.</td>

It blamed the macroeconomic and credit environment.<br />The company specializes in developing industrial parks and entire new districts. As recently as 2018, its flagship development Gu’an New Industry City, south of Beijing, was heralded as “a model for the kinds of ‘new type’ urbanization that the Chinese government hopes to see develop across the country,” according to a report from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and E-House China, a property data and information services website.<br />Analysts tend to present every troubled real-estate company in China as an idiosyncratic case, but a rapid slide in China Fortune Land’s credit ratings naturally raises questions about which other property developers are currently enjoying an unrealistically low cost of capital. Since January,  Moody’s Investors Service  and Fitch Ratings have downgraded the company four and seven notches, respectively, putting it deep into junk territory. That’s a demonstration of just how quickly things can change.<br />The pricing of the company’s bonds suggests the same. Dollar debt maturing in late February 2021 yielded below 5% as recently as September.</td>

      <td>Consulting giant advised Purdue Pharma and other opioid manufacturers to aggressively market the painkillers</td>
      <td>Consulting giant McKinsey & Co. has reached a $573 million settlement with states over its work advising OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and other drug manufacturers to aggressively market opioid painkillers, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The deal, reached with 47 states and the District of Columbia and expected to be publicly announced Thursday, would avert civil lawsuits that attorneys general could bring against McKinsey, the people said. The majority of the money will be paid upfront, with the rest dispensed in four yearly payments starting in 2022.<br />McKinsey said last week it is cooperating with government agencies on matters related to its past work with opioid manufacturers, as state and local governments sue companies up and down the opioid supply chain. At least 400,000 people have died in the U.S. from overdoses of legal and illegal opioids since 1999, according to federal data.<br />The consulting firm stopped doing opioid-related work in 2019 and said in December its work for Purdue was intended to support the legal use of opioids and help patients with legitimate medical needs.<br />While some companies have reached deals with individual states to avoid trials, the McKinsey settlement marks the first nationwide opioid pact to come from the flood of litigation that began in 2017. A much larger, $26 billion deal with three drug distributors and Johnson & Johnson has been in the works for more than a year but is still being negotiated.</td>

Clearview has a database of about 3 billion photos it scraped from the internet, allowing it to search for matches using facial recognition algorithms. The practices violated federal and provincial laws, regulators said, including in Quebec where express consent is required to use biometric data.<br />Officials with four Canadian regulatory agencies said they completed an investigation into Clearview that began last February, finding that the company served 48 accounts for law enforcement agencies and other organizations across the country, including a paid subscription by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.<br />Clearview said its technology is no longer available in Canada and that it will remove data on Canadian citizens upon their requests.<br />The investigation is the latest case involving Clearview and privacy regulators, the most prominent in this case being the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Last week the The Hamburg Data Protection Authority said Clearview’s activities are illegal under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.</td>

      <td>Academics and the progressive press mull state media controls.</td>
      <td>The academic establishment and progressive press want you to know two things: First, conservative claims of social-media bias are bogus. As Silicon Valley firms police content, their decisions are, miraculously, wholly uninfluenced by ideological preference.<br />Second, there is an urgent need for a much wider crackdown on political speech, perhaps led by the Biden Administration and requiring the creation of new government agencies. In other words, all that conservative suppression that’s, er, not happening? We need more of it.<br />New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights released a brief this week that is being amplified in the press entitled, “False Accusation: The Unfounded Claim that Social Media Companies Censor Conservatives.” It argues that “some conservatives believe their content is suppressed on partisan grounds when, in fact, it’s being singled out because it violates neutral platform rules.”<br />That is sometimes true, but the report doesn’t remotely prove that it always is. What about when  Twitter  and  Facebook  tried to suppress a New York Post story about Hunter Biden before the 2020 election? Even the report concedes that “the question of whether social media companies harbor an anti-conservative bias can’t be answered conclusively.”<br />That doesn’t stop the authors from unabashedly asserting that “the claim of anti-conservative animus is itself a form of disinformation.” It is perpetuated partly because “it appeals to the same conspiratorial mindset that has fostered the QAnon movement.”</td>

      <td>The monetary magician will try to pull a reform rabbit out of Italy’s hat.</td>
      <td>Mario Draghi is often credited with pulling off the near-impossible conjuring trick of saving the euro during the last decade’s serial sovereign debt crises. So wish him luck as he now attempts a similar David Copperfield act as Italy’s new Prime Minister. He’s going to need it.<br />Mr. Draghi was summoned Wednesday by Italian President Sergio Mattarella to form a government because almost no one else can. Giuseppe Conte’s government—his second coalition in two-and-a-half years—collapsed last month amid infighting over how to spend €209 billion in Covid-19 stimulus money from the European Union. Mr. Draghi’s appointment is Rome’s last hope of pulling together a new government to avoid snap elections.<br />Why Italy wants Mr. Draghi is easy enough to see. His tenure as president of the European Central Bank makes him one of Europe’s most respected politicians, a reputation he has bolstered in retirement by avoiding raucous domestic Italian politics. His gravitas might help him build support among Italian politicians for a new coalition, and it will reassure markets and European leaders that a responsible adult is steering the ship in Rome.<br />Why Mr. Draghi wants the job, however, is a mystery for the ages. He understands exactly what ails Italy’s economy—which we know because he spent his entire time at the ECB begging Rome and other European governments to implement supply-side tax and regulatory reforms. He also presumably understands the political forces that have kept those reforms from happening. Only patriotism can explain why he’s volunteering for such a thankless and futile job.<br />All the more so since his appointment itself points to a fundamental dysfunction in Rome. We say almost no one else can form a government because one other politician probably could: Matteo Salvini of the right-wing League. His coalition of center-right parties was the plurality winner in 2018’s election, and polls suggest the League and aligned parties would fare well if Italy held the snap election it probably needs.</td>

      <td>Biden bars ‘Wuhan virus’ but favors racial preferences at Yale.</td>
      <td>President Biden last week singled out Asian-Americans as he issued executive orders devoted to “advancing racial equity.” They include an order banning federal use of terms such as “Wuhan virus,” and another requiring the Justice Department to better track hate crimes against Asian-Americans. In pushing these measures Mr. Biden prefers to speak of promoting “equity” rather than equal treatment.<br />On Wednesday the Justice Department showed us why when it dropped its lawsuit against Yale University over its race-based admissions. Under former Attorney General Bill Barr, Justice had charged that Yale’s racial preferences violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Justice acted even before the Senate has confirmed a new Attorney General or head of the Civil Rights Division.<br />A similar but private suit against Harvard continues, this one brought by Students for Fair Admissions. But it’s likely the government will soon withdraw its supporting brief that scores Harvard for “systematically disfavoring Asian-American applicants.”<br />So Asian-Americans will be watching. While many will be relieved to see the government rejecting terms such as “China flu,” many also appreciate the real and present harm when America’s most competitive colleges and universities reject their children based on their race no matter their other qualifications.<br />“I am totally shocked by the Biden DOJ’s hasty decision to drop the Yale lawsuit, only eight days after President Biden signed an executive order claiming to combat anti-Asian discrimination,” says the president of the Asian American Coalition for Education, Yukong Zhao.</td>

MetLife’s decline was primarily related to mark-to-market losses on the financial hedges it buys to protect the company from falling interest rates and stock markets.<br />When rates and equities rise, as they did in the fourth quarter, the value of that protection falls. Wall Street analysts treat those declines as noneconomic and focus on adjusted earnings, which were nearly flat at $1.838 billion at MetLife from $1.834 billion in the year-ago period.<br />Allstate became the latest car insurer to report robust auto-insurance underwriting profit as the pandemic, and resulting weak U.S. economy, continued to hold down the number of miles motorists drove.<br />Fewer miles led to a sharp reduction in wrecks—and has prompted criticism from some consumer advocacy groups that springtime premium-refund programs weren’t generous enough. In those refund programs, insurers typically slashed 15% to 20% of customers’ premium bills for a couple months.</td>

Early seed sales to North American farmers and fall pesticide spraying helped Corteva deliver a small profit for the fourth quarter, which analysts had anticipated to show a loss.<br />The Delaware-based farm supplier is under pressure from activist investor Starboard Value LP.

      <td>International law has no remedy for property crimes a government against its own citizens, a unanimous court rules</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court stopped Holocaust victims and their descendants from seeking compensation in U.S. courts for property allegedly seized by Nazi Germany and its ally Hungary, ruling Wednesday that international law provides no remedy for property crimes a government commits against its own citizens.<br />The unanimous court acted in two separate suits over different types of property. One involved the Guelph Treasure, a collection of medieval German relics that Nazi leader Hermann Goering allegedly coerced a consortium of Jewish art dealers to sell in the 1930s at a third of its value. The other suit involved the Hungarian state railway MAV, which allegedly stripped Jews of their personal possessions before forcibly transporting them to Nazi death camps during World War II.<br />Foreign governments generally are immune from lawsuits in American courts, but Congress has created several exceptions. A federal appeals court in Washington found the Holocaust cases qualified, because the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act permits suits over “property taken in violation of international law.”<br />Because genocide violates international law, property taken from Jews as the Nazi extermination campaign progressed could be recovered in U.S. courts, the appellate court reasoned.<br />At the high court, however, writing in the lead case, Germany v. Philipp, Chief Justice John Roberts said the appeals panel had misconstrued the meaning of that exception. Rather than applying to property taken during the violation of international law, he wrote, the exception covered only a property taking that itself violated international law—that is, when a government illegally seizes the property of another country’s citizen.</td>

      <td>Biden wants to dole out checks and create new programs, not find a compromise.</td>
      <td>White House press secretary Jen Psaki was precise and pointed Monday as she dismissed efforts by 10 Republican senators to forge a compromise with President Biden on his $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. Following the senators’ meeting with Mr. Biden, she defended the president’s stimulus plan as “carefully designed” and focused on “pressing needs.” The president “will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment,” she concluded.<br />The administration’s package was neither “carefully designed” nor focused only on “pressing needs.” It’s a mishmash of the good, the bad and the in-between, tilted toward delivering cash to blue states and putting in place permanent big-government programs under the guise of temporary emergency measures.<br />Take stimulus checks. Mr. Biden would spend $465 billion on $1,400 checks, Republicans $220 billion on $1,000 checks. Two-earner couples with lots of children making up to $300,000 a year can get Biden checks, as can college students, spouses who are illegal aliens, and other adult dependents excluded from previous rounds of checks.<br />Republicans would focus on the truly needy, phasing out checks for individuals making more than $50,000 a year and couples making more than $100,000. Their approach recognizes that most people added to savings or paid down debt with previous checks and didn’t stimulate the economy by spending them.<br />In criticizing the GOP approach, an unnamed “senior administration official” told Politico that Republicans will “get no credit” when the larger Democratic checks pass, leaving them at a political disadvantage. That’s a bread-and-circuses rationale, not sound public policy.</td>

      <td>Biden officials’ urgency about emissions makes them likely to sacrifice more-important goals.</td>
      <td>President Biden is eager to make climate change a central issue, and he can expect an intense debate. The trade-offs are complicated and the politics are difficult and uncertain. But the biggest challenge may be international, particularly dealing with China, America’s pre-eminent adversary. Does the Biden administration have the slightest idea how to reconcile its global environmental goals with its China strategy?<br />The early signs aren’t encouraging. Right or wrong, climate change wasn’t on President Trump’s priority list for dealing with China. But it is paramount to Mr. Biden. In Beijing’s eyes, this makes Washington the demandeur—in diplomatic parlance, the one asking for something. It is never a preferred position in negotiations. You want China to take action on climate change? asks Xi Jinping. Let’s talk about what you’re going to give to get it.<br />Climate diplomacy czar John Kerry knows he has a problem. Taking his first swing last week, he whiffed. Mr. Kerry told the world, “The stakes on climate change just simply couldn’t be any higher than they are right now. It is existential.” He added that Mr. Biden is “totally seized by this issue.” Asked about handling China, given the many contentious disagreements, Mr. Kerry answered that “those issues will never be traded for anything” relating to climate change, which “is a critical stand-alone issue” that it is “urgent that we find a way to compartmentalize, to move forward.”<br />He didn’t explain how he’d compartmentalize. Nor does former Obama official John Podesta, who recently said that climate change “changes defense posture, it changes foreign policy posture” and “begins to drive a lot of decision making.” He then contradicted himself, urging Mr. Biden to build “a protected lane in which the other issues don’t shut down the conversation on climate change.” Driving down that protected lane will be interesting.<br />Climate adviser Gina McCarthy compounded the confusion, stressing that “we have to start shifting to clean energy, but it has to be manufactured in the United States of America, you know, not in other countries.” Her own words prove that “compartmentalization” is a fantasy. Moreover, she underscored the risk, distinctly present under Mr. Trump, that national security concerns can easily devolve into old-fashioned industrial policy.</td>

      <td>‘USA Today confirmed that all of the details of the Instagram post, including the quote, were absolutely correct. Why, then, did it flag it as misleading?’</td>
      <td>From “Lincoln High School and the Latest Fact-Checking Pitfalls” by Kalev Leetrau, RealClearPolitics.com, Feb. 2:<br /><br />On Dec. 16, Not the Bee, which describes itself as a “humor-based news, opinion, and entertainment site,” shared on its Instagram account a photograph of Abraham Lincoln titled “San Francisco to rename ABRAHAM LINCOLN High School because—I swear this is real—‘he did not show that black lives ever mattered to him.’ ” Four days later,  Facebook  fact-checking partner USA Today (which receives funding from Facebook) published a fact check of the post, issuing a verdict that it was “Missing Context.” This means that anyone viewing the Instagram post since then has seen a large red warning label saying, “Missing Context. Independent fact-checkers say information in this post could mislead people.”<br />In its fact check, USA Today confirmed that all of the details of the Instagram post, including the quote, were absolutely correct. Why, then, did it flag it as misleading? In the paper’s words, “It is true that a renaming committee included Abraham Lincoln High School on a list of 44 schools whose namesakes met its renaming criteria. But the committee has not finalized its recommendations, and the school board has not voted on the name changes—so at this time, it’s not accurate to say that the school will be renamed.”</td>

      <td>Social media, besides flooding the world with narcissism and malevolence, generates loneliness. How to overcome it?</td>
      <td>Covid is a curse, yet some citizens have prospered during its grim visitation—and not only virtue signalers, sweat-pants merchants and people involved in relocating New Yorkers to Florida.<br />This has also been a golden era for all who take seriously the admonition “there are two types of people in this world: avoid both like the plague.” Recluses, loners and other lovers of solitude are in full glow. Bowling alone is just what the doctor—and governor—ordered. Solitary martinis are the healthy choice. Large social gatherings, including weddings, feasts and funerals, have taken on a slight whiff of sedition.<br />Yet the loneliness that can result from the loss of human interaction constitutes another plague, according to Billy Baker, a staff writer at the Boston Globe. “Name a health condition you don’t want and there’s a study linking it to loneliness,” he writes in “We Need to Hang Out: A Memoir of Making Friends.” “Diabetes. Obesity. Alzheimer’s. Heart disease. Cancer. One study found that in terms of damage to your health, loneliness was the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day.”<br />For some, that’s a small price to pay for skipping church with society’s blessing or declining an invitation to dine with Aunt Madge and Uncle Joe. But Mr. Baker sees a worsening contagion. A 2019 survey found that 61% of Americans are “measurably lonely,” a seven-point jump from the previous year. AARP found that 42 million Americans over 45 suffer from “chronic loneliness,” while Brigham Young University, analyzing data from more than three million people over more than three decades, found that lonely people “saw their risk of premature death rise by up to 32 percent.” We are, Mr. Baker warns, “in the midst of a full-blown loneliness epidemic,” and it was gathering steam well before Covid arrived.<br />Television continues to hypnotize and isolate, he notes; even people between 15 and 44—“the original smartphone junkies”—surrender two hours each day to the one-eyed monster. Social media, besides flooding the world with narcissism and malevolence, generates loneliness. Mr. Baker cites a study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine showing that heavy social-media users (more than 50 visits a week) were three times more likely to feel lonely than light users (nine or less). “Each time something new moves online and stops happening face-to-face, we deplete the world’s supply of social capital.”</td>

      <td>Rioters looting and taking selfies have nothing on Italy’s ‘Years of Lead.’</td>
      <td>Fears of insurrection have been in the air, first with last summer’s left-wing attacks on police stations, courthouses and similar facilities, then with the right-wing riot at the U.S. Capitol last month. But Italians have seen far worse. The “Years of Lead” between 1969 and 1988 saw hundreds killed in violence from both the left and right.<br />The far left at the time was represented most prominently by the Red Brigades, whose acts of terrorism included kidnappings and murders of political opponents and supporters who deviated from orthodoxy. These attacks were carefully premeditated and politically motivated. In 1978 the Red Brigades kidnapped, held hostage and murdered former Prime Minister Aldo Moro because he was mediating a coalition between his party, Christian Democracy, and the Communist Party. The Red Brigades wanted revolution, not compromise or an establishment party. It’s a far cry from antifa and Black Lives Matter supporters looting stores, burning buildings and attacking policemen indiscriminately.<br />The Italian far right was represented by dispersed and disorganized neofascist groups that rebranded after World War II. They favored bombings, most notably the massacres at Milan’s Piazza Fontana in 1969 by the New Order, which killed 17, and at Bologna’s Central Station in 1980 by the Revolutionary Armed Nucleus, which killed 85. Again, a stark difference from Trump supporters storming the Capitol wearing funny clothes, taking selfies and, like their leftist counterparts, indiscriminately attacking law enforcement.<br />All told, hundreds of innocent people were killed and many more wounded during Italy’s Years of Lead. Conspiracy theories were common. The “strategy of tension,” which imagined the state intelligence apparatus and the Central Intelligence Agency worked with the far right to cause instability that could be blamed on Communists, was popular on the left. Anti-American sentiment was rampant; the Red Brigades assassinated U.S. diplomat Leamon Hunt, who headed an international peacekeeping force, in 1984. The Italian Communist Party received funding and logistical support from the Soviets.<br />“None of this exists in the so-called insurgencies in America,” says historian Lorenzo Castellani of LUISS University of Rome. “They are very different phenomena.” Terrorism in Italy had well-defined ideological foundations and structured paramilitaries. America’s “culture wars” are largely fought between internet subcultures and personality cults formed by atomized individuals who commit disturbing but futile acts of performative violence.</td>

      <td>The Petersen Automotive Museum showcases sports cars of the uberwealthy—sports cars from Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini and more.</td>
      <td>The centerpieces of “Supercars,” the Petersen Automotive Museum’s new online video tour of an exhibit that can’t be viewed in person because of Covid-19, are the 1988 Lamborghini Countach 5000QV as well as a stable of Ferraris that defined the category from the 1950s to today. That’s as it should be. Those were the cars whose images adorned the bedroom walls of teenage boys starting in the 1960s and ’70s, usually with a bikini-clad supermodel splayed across the hood. But as this overview makes clear, covering some 30 automobiles spread across the entire 14,000 square feet of the museum’s third floor, there is much more to the history and development of so-called supercars.<br />Michael Bodell, the museum’s deputy director, is our guide (the show was curated by Exhibitions Director Bryan Stevens), and he reminds us that these playthings of the uberwealthy and well-connected have a long history. We see the 1913 Mercer Type 35-J Raceabout, which competed in the first Indianapolis 500, and the 1923 Mercedes 28/95 Targa-Florio, its high hood-line hiding what was, at the time, Mercedes’s most powerful automotive engine, adapted from aircraft technology—a 7.2-liter, inline six-cylinder that produced about 95 horsepower. While these cars may not make us think of the Lamborghinis or Ferraris to come, most of America at that time was driving Henry Ford’s boxy Model T, early models of which had 2.9-liter, inline four-cylinder engines that produced only 20 horsepower.<br />The Art Deco period’s marriage of design and function is clearly evident in the next two vehicles in the virtual tour, the 1933 Duesenberg Model SJ, an ultra-luxurious long-nosed convertible coupe popular with Hollywood celebrities of the day that put out more than 300 horsepower and had a top speed of over 130 miles per hour. While someone may have driven this car that fast, that wasn’t the purpose of buying one. Rather, it was to be seen in it—leaving onlookers agog at the silver-wrapped exhaust manifolds, spoke wheels and the distinctive flying-goddess hood ornament.<br />Art Deco’s influence is even more evident in the 1938 Delahaye 145 with a custom body by French coachbuilder Henri Chapron. One of four Delahaye Grand Prix cars, it’s really a race car whose bodywork makes it road-worthy and head-turning, with rounded, sculpted fenders, streamlined hood and sloping tail, all in an elegant blue and purple two-tone finish.<br />Where we really get into modern-day supercars is the 1952 Ferrari 212/225 Inter Spyder Barchetta, originally owned by Henry Ford II; he took it to his designers, who were inspired to create the 1950s Thunderbirds. One of the few all-original cars in the museum’s collection, it has a staid black finish with white interior and whitewall tires. Its sleek, rounded edges and open cockpit are so far removed from the top-selling American car of 1952, the Buick Roadmaster, that the two shouldn’t be discussed in the same sentence.</td>
