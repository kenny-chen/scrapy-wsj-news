Their No. 21 ranking among all schools nationwide makes them No. 2 among small schools in the country. Four other Northeastern schools are among the top 10 small colleges nationwide: Wellesley College, Swarthmore College, Middlebury College and Haverford College. Their rankings among all schools in the country range from No. 29 to No. 40.<br />Harvard University is the top-ranked midsize school in the Northeast and is the highest-ranked college of any size in the country. Four other midsize Northeastern schools are among the top 10 overall nationwide: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,   Yale University, Brown University and Princeton University. Dartmouth College, No. 12 overall, is also among the top 10 midsize schools in the country.</td>

      <td>Cellphone carrier pledges record sum to secure airwaves for faster wireless service in $81 billion FCC auction</td>
      <td>Verizon Communications Inc.  secured more than half of the wireless airwaves offered in a U.S. government auction that racked up a record $81 billion in bids, according to details released Wednesday.<br />Verizon pledged $45.5 billion for the midrange spectrum rights, which can extend the reach and bandwidth of its fifth-generation wireless service.  AT&T Inc.  bid $23.4 billion, while  T-Mobile US Inc.  bid $9.3 billion.<br />The results answered a question that has absorbed wireless-industry investors since the Federal Communications Commission started the auction in December. Purchases of licenses to use certain airwaves are among the biggest checks a cellphone carrier can write.<br />Wireless companies have snapped up ever-larger chunks of the electromagnetic spectrum to keep up with their customers’ growing demand for music, video and software streamed to their smartphones. A shortage of the asset can degrade service, putting a carrier at a competitive disadvantage.<br />The most recent spectrum sale offered cellular companies, cable-TV providers and other qualified bidders a chance to expand their wireless operations into the C-band range, a swath of airwaves previously restricted to satellite communications. The commission auctioned off 280 megahertz of the band, leaving the rest to incumbent satellite users and guard bands to block interference.</td>

      <td>Department store chain Belk Inc. won bankruptcy-court approval to cut $450 million in debt, emerging from a prepackaged chapter 11 case less than 24 hours after it was filed.<br />After filing for chapter 11 protection on Tuesday, Belk won approval for its restructuring plan early Wednesday from Judge Marvin Isgur in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. Belk’s sprint through chapter 11 was the one of just a handful of cases that were completed in under 24 hours.<br />Prepackaged bankruptcy filings are popular because they take less time and cost less in administrative and professional fees. But superfast bankruptcies like Belk’s are rare. Only a handful of companies have been able to go in and out of bankruptcy in a 24- or 48-hour time frame, including catalog retailer Fullbeauty Brands Inc., which set the previous record in 2019 for the least time between the filing of a chapter 11 petition and confirmation of an exit plan.<br />Bricks-and-mortar retailers often spend more time in chapter 11 because they have dozens of landlords and typically use the bankruptcy process to negotiate lower rents and close chunks of their store base.<br />Charlotte, N.C.-based Belk, however, is using bankruptcy solely to restructure its debt while paying vendors in full and assuming the leases at its 291 stores, all of which are staying open, according to court papers.</td>

      <td>U.S. foreign policy isn’t to blame for the mullahs’ deep-rooted hatred of America and Americans.</td>
      <td>Iran, Europe and many American progressives are pressuring the Biden administration to revive the 2015 nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. Official groupthink has coalesced around a singularly misguided belief: The U.S. has so badly mistreated Iran in the past that it must engage and appease the Islamic Republic now. I understand this view because I was once taught to believe it. This mindset is what convinced me in 2016 that I could safely do research for my dissertation in Iran. My optimism was misplaced. Not long after I arrived, I was imprisoned by Iran’s brutal regime and held hostage for more than three years.<br />When I went to Iran, I shared the prevailing academic view of the Middle East. I had absorbed the oft-repeated lesson that political Islam arose in response to Western colonialism and imperialism, and that the West—particularly America’s Middle East behavior—was chiefly responsible for the region’s chaos. My professors taught that the U.S. had treated Iran with a mixture of Orientalist condescension and imperialist aggression since the founding of the Islamic Republic in 1979. I believed America’s role in the 1953 coup that removed Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh explained everything that had gone wrong in Iran. Convinced that the mullahs’ hostility toward the U.S. was exaggerated, I often dismissed allegations of the regime’s malign behavior as American propaganda.<br />Since it was obvious that American foreign policy itself was the problem, and that the regime would happily normalize relations once the U.S. pivoted away from disrespect, I assumed I’d be left alone in Iran if I remained apolitical and focused on historical research. Imagine my shock when the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence arrested me on false espionage charges in August 2016, shortly after the implementation of the JCPOA—during what appeared to be a period of rapprochement between the U.S. and Iran. I was thrown into solitary confinement, forced to confess things my interrogator knew I had not done, and sentenced to 10 years in prison.<br />My interrogator made clear that my sole “crime” was being an American. He told me I was to be used as a pawn in exchange for U.S.-held Iranian prisoners and the release of frozen Iranian assets. (I was released in a 2019 prisoner swap.)<br />My terrible 40-month imprisonment was a period of intense re-education about the relationship between Iran and the U.S. The Islamic Republic is an ambitious power, but not a constructive one. It’s a spoiler, projecting influence by exporting revolution and terrorism via its proxies in the Middle East. Domestically, the mullahs have failed to deliver on their political and economic promises to the Iranian people, on whom they maintain their grip through oppression.</td>

It provides services including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and selling and redeeming Treasury bills.<br />The Fed sent an alert to such customers at 12:43 p.m. ET of “a possible issue or disruption to multiple services.” In a subsequent alert, it said Fed staff became aware of “a disruption for all services” beginning around 11:15 a.m.</td>

      <td>After avoiding dementia dramas, a writer finds new perspectives in a spate of films exploring the disease in unconventional ways.</td>
      <td>My mother was the reason I initially resisted “The Father.” The new film stars Anthony Hopkins as a man struggling against the effects of dementia. That synopsis was enough to trip my avoidance instinct, despite the time that has passed since my mom’s death, on Feb. 18, 2017, at age 76 from Alzheimer’s disease.<br />I had learned all I wanted to know about dementia from her. Over seven years, I saw it change Joan Jurgensen from the captain of my family to a castaway adrift in time and place, who fussed over invisible children at her feet, grieved anew each time she learned that her parents died decades ago, and sang church hymns even after she struggled to form linear sentences.<br />But lately I’ve been re-examining that chapter, drawn in by the work of filmmakers using cinematic techniques—manipulations of time, perspective, setting and genre—to explore the interior worlds of dementia. With more and more people living with Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia (now nearly 6 million Americans, plus their caregivers) these movies show how reckonings with the disease in art are evolving.<br /><br />Last year’s “Relic,” from writer-director Natalie Erika James, is a horror movie set in a house mirroring the space inside its owner’s deteriorating mind. In “Elizabeth Is Missing,” a recent PBS movie starring Glenda Jackson, 84 years old, a woman’s memory loss is a plot device and a metaphor in her search for a vanished friend. In the format-bending documentary “Dick Johnson Is Dead,” filmmaker Kirsten Johnson grapples with the impending loss of her father by casting him in faux movie scenes, complete with stunt doubles and elaborate sets.</td>

      <td>He refused to apologize for fake transgressions and never lost his humor. More could follow his example.</td>
      <td>Rush Limbaugh is frequently credited with reviving talk radio in America, and that is true. But Limbaugh was also “patient zero” of today’s cancel culture, with dozens of efforts to kill his program for one ginned-up controversy after another. They all failed, and the inside story of how he handled the efforts to discredit him is a useful lesson for today.<br />Rush’s first rule was simple: “No faux apologies for fake transgressions.” The best illustration was the “phony soldiers” controversy in 2007. Rush was speaking with a caller on his program about “phony soldiers” like Jesse Macbeth, who had falsely claimed to have seen war crimes, and who was ultimately convicted for receiving veterans benefits to which he was not entitled. But Harry Reid and 40 other Senate Democrats deliberately misinterpreted his comments and sent his syndicator a letter demanding an apology, which of course wouldn’t have been accepted.<br />Rush auctioned their letter off in a show of gleeful brio, marching the document on stage handcuffed to his security guard during a Philadelphia speech. He matched the $2.1 million winning bid with his own funds, and donated the money to scholarships for the children of fallen service members and police officers. It was classic Rush: punching a hole in the arrogant, exposing their flaws, turning something fake into something larger than life, all while having “more fun than a human being should be allowed to have,” as he often said.<br />But it wasn’t all fun and games. Rush’s sponsors included thousands of small and growing businesses; they relied on his audience to pay their employees. When the industry of boycotts and business harassment came knocking at his door, threatening his sponsors with ignominy for the crime of wanting to offer their products to his audience, Rush pushed back—and hard.<br />He privately supported his sponsors and told them that the so-called boycotts would have no effect on their business unless they relented and denied themselves access to his listeners. And he was right. Internet mobs are almost always made up of small numbers of people sending huge numbers of messages. They count on sheer volume to intimidate business. Rush showed sponsors research that proved that 80% or more of all online boycott messages came from a group of people so small as to “fit in the elevator we used to come to your office for this meeting.”</td>

      <td>Fed chairman says more progress is needed toward employment, inflation goals</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell underscored his determination to return the U.S. labor market to full strength, saying Wednesday the central bank won’t begin to tighten easy-money policies until it sees much more improvement.<br />The Fed will maintain ultralow interest rates and continue hefty asset purchases until “substantial further progress has been made” toward its employment and inflation goals, Mr. Powell told the House Financial Services Committee in testimony identical to his opening statement Tuesday at the Senate Banking Committee. He said those goals are “likely to take some time” to achieve.<br />He also acknowledged that the economic outlook has improved since a slowdown in late 2020. The effects have rippled across financial markets in recent days, pushing bond yields up and prices for assets that are sensitive to interest rates, such as technology stocks, down. Mr. Powell’s assurances Tuesday that Fed policy is on hold for the foreseeable future drove stocks to a partial rebound.<br />But while financial markets often reflect expectations of economic growth, inflation and corporate earnings in the future, Mr. Powell said Wednesday the Fed is looking to see “actual progress, not forecast progress” toward its employment and inflation goals before it tightens its policies.<br />He said the Fed doesn’t foresee raising its benchmark fed-funds rate from near zero until three conditions have been met: a broad range of statistics indicate that the labor market is at maximum strength, inflation has hit its 2% target and forecasters expect inflation to remain at that level or higher.</td>

      <td>David B. Rivkin Jr. and Jason Snead’s assertions in “An Unconstitutional Voting ‘Reform’” (op-ed, Feb. 17) that H.R.1, the For the People Act, is unconstitutional are inaccurate. As a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, I know the Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power “at any time” to “make or alter” the regulation of the “time, place and manner” of federal elections. The broad grant of Congressional authority is contained in Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution and was recently noted by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Rucho redistricting case.<br />In addition, the 14th and 15th Amendments give Congress the power to eliminate racial discrimination in voting and the democratic process, such as restricting or creating barriers to voting, partisan gerrymandering and felony disenfranchisement. Though we had record voter turnout in the 2020 elections, voters continue to be disenfranchised because of long lines, broken voting machines and polling-place closures, disproportionately affecting black, brown and indigenous communities.<br />To frame this legislation as a means to only “benefit Democrats” is also false. During my years as a Republican election lawyer, I represented Republicans who supported many of the policies that are included in the bill, including voter registration and mail-in ballot provisions. Recent polling has also shown that two-thirds of Americans across party lines support the For the People Act. This landmark legislation is not only written within the legal bounds of our Constitution, it is also an integral step toward our nation’s promise of a democracy accessible to all Americans.<br />Congress should pass this legislation, which represents the clear will of the people. Our democracy can’t wait.<br />Trevor Potter</td>

      <td>A new SRD allocation would provide liquidity to many emerging and developing countries that today have severely limited access to external financing.</td>
      <td>Your editorial “Magic Money for the Rich” (Feb. 19) on the IMF’s special drawing rights (SDRs) misses the forest for the trees. The entire world is looking to rebound post-Covid-19 from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. You should be encouraging the use of policy tools that have been proven already to help restore confidence, stability and growth—while especially benefiting those most in need. An SDR allocation helped to do just that during the global financial crisis, and SDRs can again provide such help right now.<br />No one is claiming that the SDR is perfect, but a rational judgment would begin by examining what a new allocation would actually accomplish. First, it would provide liquidity to many emerging and developing countries that today have severely limited access to external financing but have the pressing need to pay for health and economic support. The approximately $274 billion that would accrue to emerging and developing countries as their share of an SDR 500 billion increase would represent a 10% boost to their international reserves and, in some cases, double that amount.<br />Second, advanced economies—and stronger emerging economies—would be able to further support the developing world by on-lending their newly acquired SDRs on a voluntary basis. We know that this “recycling” works because the IMF already has accomplished this using existing SDRs: Poor countries could receive about $24 billion in this fashion.<br />Third, an SDR allocation itself doesn’t require budgetary resources from any country. It doesn’t add to their debt, and it creates no new obligations to any participating country.<br />Your editorial assigns great importance to the SDRs’ quota-based initial distribution that you characterize as inefficient and potentially even malign. The applicable standard, however, is a comparison with alternative tools that can be applied in a relevant scale and with the requisite speed. It is in this context that the potential value of the SDR becomes apparent. Its design ensures accountability, its past use demonstrates its effectiveness and its appropriate application would ensure fairness.</td>

In the past, my travel experiences have been disturbed by passengers accompanied by untrained emotional-support animals that may make them feel comfortable, but disturb fellow passengers.<br />No longer will I be asked to move to make room for a fake service dog. No longer will my guide dog, who lies quietly at my feet throughout an entire flight, be disturbed by an emotional-support dog barking at her. No longer will dogs be urinating and defecating in airline terminals, which create a bad impression of actual service dogs that are trained not to relieve themselves in public places.<br />Anyone who owns a pet can understand a deep attachment to a beloved animal, but some of us need service animals to navigate busy departure terminals, the narrow confines of airplanes and our eventual destinations. The visually impaired travel with our guide dogs out of necessity, and the DOT and airlines were justified and entirely correct in setting new guidelines for identification and registration of service dogs.<br />Virginia Jacko</td>

      <td>The novelist known for ‘Strangers on a Train’ and ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’ inspired a new kind of movie villain in the 1950s who still stalks us today, in the centenary year of her birth.</td>
      <td><br /><br />The next time you watch a movie or TV series about a heartless serial killer, say a silent word of thanks to the novelist who made such plots possible. It was Patricia Highsmith, born a century ago last month, who flung open the doors of Hollywood and invited the crazies in.<br />Highsmith specialized in jolting tales of mentally disordered men and women who mirrored her own profound strangeness and motiveless malignity (she was a racist and anti-Semite). “If she hadn’t had her work, she would have been sent to an insane asylum or an alcoholics’ home,” a friend claimed. She made her debut as a novelist in 1950 with “Strangers on a Train,” the story of a charming psychopath named Bruno who offers a deal to a man whom he meets by chance on a train: He will kill the man’s promiscuous wife in return for having the father he despises murdered, assuming that no one will connect the two killings and both men will get away scot-free. Bruno fulfills his end of the deal, but Guy, the other man, never took the pact seriously and refuses to cooperate, sending Bruno into a downward spiral of lunatic frenzy. When Alfred Hitchcock filmed “Strangers” in 1951, he cast Robert Walker, heretofore a boy-next-door type, as Bruno, and Walker gave a performance whose flamboyant panache is at once perversely appealing and truly terrifying.<br />It was unusual to encounter such villains in Hollywood films of the ’30s and ’40s. The Motion Picture Production Code forbade the portrayal of villains who were sympathetic, much less charming or charismatic. Moreover, the “bad guys” in gangster movies, westerns and adventure films of the period were normally motivated by greed or revenge, not the mere desire to shed blood and sow chaos. And while some sympathetic villains, like Humphrey Bogart’s aging heister in Raoul Walsh’s “High Sierra” (1941), made it onto the screen, they, like the usual bad guys, got it in the end.</td>

      <td>Actors and directors on the movies and TV shows that they’ve loved in the last year</td>
      <td>Looking ahead to the Golden Globe Awards Sunday on NBC, we reached out to four nominees to ask them what they have been enchanted by in the last year. Here, they each recommend one of their favorite nominated titles. Below, edited excerpts:<br /><br />( Netflix )<br />Mr. Rhys is nominated for his performance of the title role in HBO’s “Perry Mason.” He recommends the Netflix’s series ‘Ozark,’ about a couple that launders money for a drug cartel, now three seasons deep. “Ozark” is nominated for multiple awards, including best performance by an actor in a drama series for Jason Bateman.<br />“What I always harken to about a show is: What’s the initial hook? After the first episode of ‘Ozark’ you go: oh, s—, how is that gonna resolve? And then you’re in. When the premise is that strong, you’ve got the golden ticket. And no one does everyman in peril better than Jason Bateman. You want to see how he’s going to deal with certain situations. And in a way, it’s kind of masochistic, to watch something where you’re so anxiety-ridden. He also has that rare thing where he can convey [it] comedically in a moment when it shouldn’t be present. Whether it’s through gestures or osmosis, he can kind of make you laugh in the most heightened situations.”</td>

      <td>Tie-up would expand role of technology in clinical trials and drug development</td>
      <td>Clinical-trial operator  Icon  PLC said it would acquire rival  PRA Health Sciences Inc.  for $12 billion, creating a powerhouse provider of services to pharmaceutical companies that are farming out more work to contractors.<br />Dublin-based Icon, which reported $2.8 billion in sales last year, helps pharmaceutical companies run studies testing experimental drugs and vaccines in people, including deploying nurses to people’s homes for patient recruitment and monitoring. The tie-up would create one of the world’s largest contract-research organizations, known as CROs, which test experimental drugs in animals and help run studies of promising late-stage drugs in humans.<br />In acquiring PRA, Icon would expand into digital and technology capabilities that are playing roles in clinical trials accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, such as virtual monitoring of study subjects as people stay at home and avoid public places. Raleigh, N.C.-based PRA’s products include mobile and digital platforms that enable trial subjects to enter medical information on their smartphones, easing the burden of data collection on study managers.<br />“I think the pandemic has shown everybody that we can do things differently and it works,” Icon Chief Executive Steve Cutler said Wednesday.  Dr. Cutler said Icon has about 1,000 employees working on Covid-19 vaccine research for  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE .<br />PRA has been helping drugmakers recruit subjects for trials evaluating Covid-19 drugs and vaccines and helping make Covid-19 testing more available.  The pandemic, and the need for reliable and quick testing and other services, has spawned a flurry of new startups and prompted other companies to broaden services.</td>

      <td>Oenophilia is often undertaken with the utmost reverence. So our wine columnist went looking for levity—and bottles that bring joy in more ways than one</td>
      <td>I’VE BEEN THINKING about Ralph Steadman recently. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the English illustrator lent his whimsical style to wine books as well as the catalog for the Oddbins wine, beer and spirits retail chain in the U.K. Think tipsy, red-nosed drinkers and mice dipping into glasses of Sherry. The world of wine according to Mr. Steadman was highly irreverent, slightly diabolical and a great deal of fun.<br />The real wine world, by contrast, hasn’t been so much fun lately. Winemakers whose sales are down—their tasting rooms closed, in many cases, by government order—tend to be more earnest than amusing. Retailers, meanwhile, are more likely to sell wines with the aid of point scores than mouse cartoons. But because I believe that even the most serious oenophile appreciates, and perhaps needs, a laugh or two, I went looking for present-day wine fun. Happily, I found some good stuff.<br />“No one calls me unless they want to talk about something funny on our wine label,” said John Williams, founder of Frog’s Leap Winery in Napa Valley, when I called him the other week. I told him this was one of those calls. I’d bought a bottle of his wine recently and found a note on the back label instructing the buyer: “Open At Other End.”<br />Frog’s Leap has been funny for decades, ever since its first wine, a Sauvignon Blanc, debuted in 1981. The winery’s motto, “Time’s fun when you’re having flies,” made it clear that no one at Frog’s Leap, least of all Mr. Williams, takes him- or herself too seriously. For example, a timeline entry on the winery’s website notes, “John befriends Jonah Beer, Director of Sales at Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars while on the road and teaches him how to cheat on his expense account.” (The bit about the expense account is crossed out.)<br />Mr. Williams did note that humor can have its drawbacks. “When you inject any kind of playfulness into your messaging, to some people that might suggest that your wine isn’t good,” he said. I assured him I take him seriously, and the savory 2019 Frog’s Leap Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc ($19) I bought was quite good.</td>

Tipton of the Southern District of Texas, in a decision issued late Tuesday night, said the administration hadn’t offered a reasonable explanation for an across-the-board pause that left little room for considering deportations on a case-by-case basis.<br />The Biden administration on Jan. 20, its first day, announced the 100-day deportation moratorium, and the Department of Homeland Security began enforcing the pause on Jan. 22.<br />Judge Tipton said the new administration was entitled to leeway to formulate its enforcement priorities and review the Trump administration’s immigration policies, “but a need to assess priorities does not necessarily mean a pause on government functions.”<br />The judge, a Trump appointee, issued a temporary restraining order last month that initially blocked the policy, but those orders are short in duration. In the latest move, he issued a preliminary injunction against the pause, which will block it indefinitely.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Economic activity will pick up as the pandemic recedes and Americans are vaccinated against Covid-19, but the recovery will be gradual rather than sudden, a top economic adviser to President Biden said Wednesday.<br />“It is a dimmer switch, not an on-off switch,” Jared Bernstein, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said at a Wall Street Journal Executive Membership Series event. “People are not going to snap back into action on some set date because the vaccine penetration rate hits 53% or whatever. It’s going to be more gradual.”<br />Mr. Bernstein defended the president’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan against critics who say it risks overheating the economy and generating inflation. He acknowledged that rising inflation is a potential risk, but that a weak recovery that leads to scarring for households and businesses—such as long-term unemployment, foreclosures and bankruptcies—would do more harm.<br />“There is room for more heat,” he said, pointing to data on weekly claims for unemployment benefits, which came to 861,000 in the most recent report, and elevated jobless rates in minority communities as evidence of spare capacity in the economy.<br />Mr. Bernstein pointed to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said Tuesday that he doesn’t expect a temporary burst of federal spending to cause a large or persistent rise in inflation.</td>

But his tenure has been marked by several controversies, including this month’s $573 million settlement with states over McKinsey’s work advising OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and other drug manufacturers to aggressively market opioid painkillers<br />Mr. Sneader’s letter to employees about the opioid settlement was noticeably blunt in criticizing the firm’s behavior. He said the firm fell short of its standards and “did not adequately acknowledge the epidemic unfolding in our communities or the terrible impact of opioid misuse and addiction, and for that I am deeply sorry.”<br />Some partners felt that language was too strong and its advice to clients was legal and given in good faith, people familiar with the matter said.</td>

Hidden inside a box normally used to transport musical equipment, Mr. Ghosn was wheeled past security officers and passport control at an Osaka airport.

      <td>Volvo Car Corp. and  Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd.  said Wednesday that they would combine their engine and transmissions business but backed away from a full-blown merger of the Chinese and Swedish companies that are owned by Chinese billionaire Li Shufu.<br />The move highlights a trend, increasingly favored by investors, for companies to sharpen their focus rather than become entangled in larger conglomerates that often dilute the value of their constituent businesses.<br />The agreement leaves the two auto makers as stand-alone entities under the umbrella of Mr. Li’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. It allows Geely Auto to move forward with plans to raise the equivalent of nearly $3 billion through a share listing on Shanghai’s STAR Market for growth stocks. The decision also renews speculation that Volvo could seek an independent stock-market listing.<br />The two companies said last year that they were holding talks that could lead to combining their businesses. In the end, they said they feared that a merger would present integration issues and distract them during a period of industrywide transformation in the shift to electric vehicles.<br />“A full merger would be too much internal focus and organizational disputes and power plays,” Volvo Chief Executive Officer Håkan Samuelsson said in an interview. “I think that’s number one, to really maintain full focus on growth, especially since we have been growing a lot on the Geely and the Volvo side and don’t want to jeopardize anything there.”</td>

The yields were minus 0.057% for three-year debt and 0.646% for nine-year, the cheapest borrowing costs it has achieved to date. It was the second time it has issued bonds in euros.<br />One of the most oil-dependent countries in the world, Saudi Arabia has regularly tapped international bond markets since 2016 to balance its budget amid crude price swings. Its economy contracted 3.9% last year as the coronavirus pandemic hit global energy demand, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund, leaving it with a budget deficit of 12% of economic output by December.<br />The government has put forward a plan to more than halve this shortfall by cutting spending this year. Its decision to issue in euros is likely part of this, analysts said.<br />The eurozone has had a negative policy rate since 2014, which acts as a reference for sovereign and corporate debt, bringing down the cost of borrowing in euros overall. Governments and companies around the world often tap Europe’s bond market to access cheaper funds. China was able to borrow at negative rates for the first time last year in a three-part euro-denominated debt sale.</td>

And it’s built into my training as a chef.”<br />His first cookbook, “Mister Jiu’s in Chinatown: Recipes and Stories from the Birthplace of Chinese American Food,” co-authored with Tienlon Ho, comes out March 9. This recipe is a pared-down version of one included in the salad chapter. Mr. Jew calls for scattering sweet mandarin segments across a platter and topping them with shaved fennel, tarragon and salty Marcona almonds. The dressing is a revelation, a mix of olive oil, vinegar, toasted anise seeds and a surprising creamy element: almond milk. “It works like buttermilk,” Mr. Jew said. At the restaurant he uses a house-made “milk” made from apricot kernels, but a good store-bought almond milk works just fine here.<br />Though a salad like this one might not immediately register as the sort of Chinese American classic Mr. Jew features on his menu, this recipe still speaks to his memories of eating at Chinese restaurants as a child. “For dessert it was almond Jell-O with fruit cocktail,” he said. “These flavors remind me of that.”<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

The resulting gas shortage sent prices soaring and disadvantaged power plants that purchase daily fuel supplies on the spot market.<br />The state’s gas infrastructure and power generation failed for similar reasons: Neither is designed to perform in subfreezing weather, unlike similar equipment in parts of the U.S. where colder temperatures are more common.<br />Engineers said Texas gas production was slowed by low temperatures that froze water produced alongside oil and gas and entered oil-field tanks. Compressors that help move oil and gas through pipelines also became inoperable because of the cold weather.</td>

      <td>Home Depot ’s  Chief Executive Craig Menear boasted on Tuesday that “for many customers, the home has never been more important.” Investors are getting anxious about how long that will continue.<br />Both Home Depot and  Lowe’s  had strong holiday quarters ended late January, with sales up roughly 25% compared with a year earlier. Among the best selling items were lumber and outdoor living categories such as patio furniture and grills. For the year, Lowe’s and Home Depot saw their revenue expand by 24.2% and 19.9%, respectively.<br />But investors are focused on the future. Despite strong results, Lowe’s and Home Depot shares dropped after their respective earnings calls this week.<br />Lowe’s stuck to the guidance that it laid out in December, in which it said sales would be around $86 billion in 2021 under the most bullish scenario, a decline of 4% from 2020. Home Depot declined to give guidance.<br />So far, there are no signs of sales slowing down. January was the strongest month of growth last quarter for both companies, boosted by fresh stimulus payments to consumers. Home Depot said on its earnings call that it has seen continued strong demand in February.</td>

      <td>A brief history of the accessibly priced Nuptse—a nostalgic icon adored by celebs like Bella Hadid—and three equally toasty modern-day options</td>
      <td>IN 1992, the North Face introduced its “Nuptse” down jacket, destined to become an icon of puffiness. It came in primary colors, with a conspicuous band of black spanning the shoulders and the curvy, highly recognizable white North Face logo prominently displayed. Those born in the 1980s or early ’90s will likely recall this jacket from their high-school days. Others might remember seeing teens in these fire-truck-red and bright-yellow puffers around town, or even on the cover of New York magazine’s 1996 “Prep-School Gangsters” issue, which featured a fleet of Nuptse’d-out youths. That’s how central this coat was to pre-Y2K fashion.<br />But the Nuptse jacket is no mere memory. Reissued in 2018, the retro puffer has proven so popular lately that certain sizes and colors are perpetually sold out on the North Face website. One indication of its must-have status: On the Lyst Index, a ranking compiled by Lyst, a British company that tracks the behavior of more than 9 million online shoppers a month, the Nuptse jacket was the top item during the fourth quarter of 2020—for both men and women. Peter Henderson, who manages the Index, noted that this was the first time that’s happened.<br />Some of the Nupste’s current popularity can be attributed to its celebrity fans—particularly female ones. After stars including models like Emily Ratajkowski and Bella Hadid wore the Nuptse in recent months, it’s ricocheted across Instagram accounts and media that tracks celebrity style.<br />But the coat has also surged for more practical reasons. Mr. Henderson noted that with many people forced to socialize outside during the pandemic, even in frigid conditions, demand for mammoth, goose-down-filled coats like the Nuptse has risen. The price is also right: At $280 the Nuptse—when you can find it in stock—is comparatively affordable as down outerwear goes. And being budget-conscious is also on trend during this uncertain pandemic period. (That said, the North Face has released some pretty high-end puffers recently, including a nearly $3,000 collaboration with Gucci.)<br />The other hook of the Nuptse is nostalgia. Along with mock-neck T-shirts, washed jeans and flannel shirts, the Nuptse is a ’90s fashion icon that, for many, provides the comfort of familiarity. “People are after the things that make them think of different periods in time rather than that difficult moment that we find ourselves in,” said Mr. Henderson.</td>

      <td>Federal judge’s decision allows largest state’s law protecting open internet principles to go into effect</td>
      <td>A federal judge rejected a telecommunications-industry challenge to California’s two-year-old net neutrality law, clearing the way for the state to begin enforcing the consumer protections.<br />The law’s supporters argued that stronger protections for net neutrality—the principle that cable and wireless companies should treat all online content under consistent standards—will protect the internet’s open nature and prevent telecom companies from picking winners and losers on the web. Internet-service providers said the rules are unnecessary and interfere with reasonable business practices.<br />The Tuesday decision from U.S. District Court Judge John Mendez denied an injunction sought by trade groups representing the country’s largest cable and wireless companies. The ruling means officials could start enforcing the rules within weeks absent other legal challenges.<br />California legislators passed the law in 2018. The state protections followed the spirit of federal rules written during the Obama administration, by barring internet service providers from blocking access to lawful websites or slowing down connections to certain web domains. The law also banned “zero rating,” an industry practice of providing some data free of charge while billing for online traffic from other sources.<br />A coalition of telephone and cable companies immediately opposed the rule and the Trump administration’s Justice Department sued to block it. The administration argued that new rules passed by a Republican-led Federal Communications Commission not only repealed federal net-neutrality protections but also pre-empted the kind of regulations California had sought on a state level.</td>

Bitcoin now makes up about 5% of the company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.<br />This may perhaps import a bit of bitcoin’s volatility into the company’s share price, which dipped 6% on Wednesday morning. Though any discount to its multiple would hardly make a dent: Square is trading at over 190 times forward earnings.<br />Still, it emphasizes the point that Square may need some pandemic-era trends, including the enthusiasm for bitcoin, to last into the future to reach the goals investors are betting on.<br />Take the original business of Square, providing payments and other services to small and medium-size sellers. Many of those merchants have adapted to incredibly tough conditions by adding websites, new revenue streams and virtual payments, and Square has upped spending on sales and marketing to help drive that transition. Square’s seller gross payment volume from online jumped 50% in 2020, even as its seller payment volume overall was flat for the year.</td>

      <td>Yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury bond hits pre-pandemic level</td>
      <td>A settlement between creditors in Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy case is lifting prices of the commonwealth’s municipal bonds and shares of insurance companies that guaranteed payments on the bonds.<br />Traders drove up prices of the island’s benchmark $3.5 billion general obligation bond due 2035 by 3.3% to around 78 cents on the dollar after the Tuesday deal removed one of the last logjams in Puerto Rico’s nearly four-year journey through bankruptcy court. Roughly $275 million face amount of the bond changed hands Tuesday and about $30 million traded early Wednesday morning, making it one of the most actively traded securities in the municipal-bond market, according to data from Electronic Municipal Market Access.<br />Shares of the insurers that guaranteed payments on billions of dollars of Puerto Rico’s defaulted bonds also rose as the settlement removed some uncertainty about the amount of claims they would need to pay.  MBIA Inc.’s  stock has jumped around 15% this week, while  Ambac Financial Group Inc.’s  shares have gained about 7.2%.<br />The disparate hedge funds and mutual funds that own Puerto Rico’s debts have agreed to several previous restructurings of the payments they are owed only to be forced to recut those deals as natural disasters and the Covid-19 pandemic hammered the island’s economy. Holders of about $11.7 billion support the new proposal in a major step to resolving the $35 billion of claims against Puerto Rico, according to an announcement by the oversight board managing the island’s financial overhaul.<br />The most recent iteration stands out because for the first time it includes “conditional support” from insurers who guaranteed bond payments, analysts at CreditSights said in a report. “Their support together with the supporting uninsured creditors means there may be enough support for the [plan] to exceed the requisite acceptance thresholds,” they said.</td>

The San Mateo, Calif.-based videogame provider plans to hold a direct listing for its shares on or around March 10 on the New York Stock Exchange, bypassing the traditional route of an initial public offering.<br />Roblox isn’t a traditional videogame company and is using a nontraditional process to potentially reach investors as the pandemic has driven people to spend more time and money on gameplay. Here’s what you need to know about the company and its plans for a direct listing.<br />Roblox is a free online platform that features tens of millions of multiplayer games made by its own players with tools the company provides. The games range from obstacle-course challenges and iterations of capture the flag to contests based on popular characters such as Peppa Pig and Sonic the Hedgehog. Company officials have said they are interested in increasing the use of Roblox for things such as virtual concerts and meetings.<br />Roblox is accessible on computers, consoles and mobile devices. The company said it had roughly 33 million daily users last year, of whom more than half are under the age of 13. Players in Roblox appear in the form of customizable avatars.<br />Programmers David Baszucki and Erik Cassel started Roblox in 2004. Mr. Cassel died from cancer in 2013, and Mr. Baszucki serves as chief executive, president and board chairman. Mr. Baszucki remains the company’s largest shareholder and holds more than 70% of the voting rights.</td>

In my mind I saw a charming Delft-blue-and-white kitchen with bracketed wall shelves displaying glass jars full of the vegetables I would farm on the arable part of my one-eighth acre lot.<br />What we ended up with looked more like the interior of a junked subway car. The “white” paint I picked gave the walls an aortic, bluish tinge when paired with the gray linoleum floor. Flimsy plywood shelves bowed. A Smurf-blue window blind above the sink failed to pull the whole look together.<br />Over the years, I have come to understand that one of the biggest problems amateur home designers face is not imagination but vocabulary. If you don’t have the words to adequately describe what you want, you won’t get the help you need to create it.<br />For decades, I’ve been learning the right words, and trying to remember them, by collecting a library of design books. My 10 favorites—all of which can be purchased new or used online—cover what I consider the four topics you need to tackle when creating a home: landscaping, architecture, interior design and decoration.<br />“Every beginner needs an absolute bible that defines all the elements of interior design,” said Toronto interior designer David Thomas. Mine is this 1,160-page tome, which describes interior elements and gives rules for designing them. Thousands of illustrations help the reader identify architectural features such as molding (crown, deep-script, chair rail, picture rail) and windows (hopper, awning, vertical pivot, eyebrow with Gothic divided lites). It’s filled with great tips such as leaving 36 inches of clearance around a dining table to comfortably push out a chair.</td>

      <td>The British company behind Lysol and other disinfectant brands was a clear pandemic winner. Investors have little confidence that last year’s sales boom will stick, which seems overly pessimistic.<br />Reckitt Benckiser ,  which also owns health-oriented brands such as Durex condoms and Mucinex cold remedies, said Wednesday that sales increased by an unprecedented 11.8% last year compared with 2019, stripping out the impact of portfolio changes and exchange rate moves. Operating margins fell while the company invested heavily in research and development, improved its supply chain and expanded into new markets—bringing its disinfectant brands to Brazil and Turkey, for example.<br />Shareholders seem to think the best is over. The company’s guidance that sales will grow by just 0% to 2% in 2021 hasn’t helped. Reckitt’s share price is back at pre-Covid levels, having fallen roughly 25% from its pandemic peak last summer. As a multiple of next year’s earnings, the stock trades at 18.7 times. That is cheap for a consumer staples company—though peers such as  Unilever  have also underperformed in recent weeks as investors become more focused on economic recovery.<br />Even if demand for cleaning products ebbs, a portfolio shake-up is under way to root out losing brands. Reckitt has put its Chinese infant nutrition business under review. It is an admission that the previous management team’s $17 billion purchase of Mead Johnson in 2017—an expensive bet on the Chinese baby food market—has soured.<br />Reckitt isn’t the only foreign baby-food manufacturer struggling in China. Local competitor Feihe is taking market share from  Nestlé  and  Danone  too, and China’s birthrate plummeted by 15% last year, according to official statistics. Reckitt also said Wednesday that it has sold its Scholl footcare brand for an undisclosed amount. Together, these two weak businesses contributed around 8% of Reckitt’s sales.</td>

The actress, a woman in her 20s, hasn’t been identified.<br />Under the French legal system, the filing of preliminary charges indicates that the investigating judge believes there is enough evidence against Mr. Depardieu for authorities to deepen their investigation of the accusations. The judge could then decide to drop the charges or order him to stand trial.<br />“Mr. Depardieu is and remains presumed innocent,” said the actor’s lawyer Hervé Temime. “He strongly contests the accusations against him.”<br />The actress brought a complaint against Mr. Depardieu, 72-years-old, in August 2018, saying he sexually assaulted and raped her on two occasions earlier that month at his house in the upscale 6th arrondissement of Paris.</td>

      <td>Several states and countries require visitors to show a negative Covid-19 test or face a quarantine. Do-it-yourself kits are the easiest solution, but just make sure you’re using the right kind.</td>
      <td>SPRING IS ALMOST here, and if your escape fantasies run to more than a short drive to Aunt Susie’s in the Poconos, odds are you’ll be booking a Covid-19 test along with your air tickets. Many destinations—Hawaii, Maine, most of the Caribbean and even Aspen, Colo.—will let you avoid a quarantine if you’ve recently tested negative for the virus. But you might need to submit to multiple tests during your getaway. A post-arrival screen is required in some places, including Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jordan and Rwanda. If you’re abroad, the U.S. State Department specifies that everyone returning to the U.S. show proof of a negative Covid-19 test. Although more people are getting inoculated against the virus, a vaccine alone won’t ensure access to most destinations, including the U.S.<br />One way to avoid endless clinic visits? Self-administered Covid tests you can take at home or in your hotel. Last year the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began greenlighting DIY tests under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), while other options come with a seal of approval from airlines: Delta, for example, has teamed with Azova (azovahealth.com/test/delta), which offers home saliva tests for travelers for $119 or $115 at some  Costco  locations. Both require a video observation call during the actual test, insisted upon by some destinations. You can even double up on kits, packing one in your bag in case you need a second one.<br />Hawaii has also begun a pilot program with biometrics company Clear, whose Health Pass app lets travelers access at-home tests, as well as in-person test locations, from a list of approved providers. The app also allows users to whisk results directly to the airline on which they’re flying to the Aloha state.<br />Other home test services include LabCorp’s Pixel and Vault, to which the  JetBlue  website refers fliers. Customers sign up online to get the test kit and a return envelope to send the sample—nasal swab or saliva, depending on the type you order—back to the lab. Results are usually posted within 48 to 72 hours after you’ve taken the test.<br />Take care that your test meets the requirements at your destination; many request a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) lab test, although the more rapid antigen version is now more widely accepted. An even faster way to dispense with testing might soon be available: The FDA has recently approved new tests that will deliver results at home in 30 minutes—eliminating the agonizing wait for a timely result. As of now, however, it’s unclear when—or if—they’ll be accepted by travel destinations.</td>

      <td>Lucid Motors has a better claim than most to be the next Tesla, but Reddit-reading investors in the company taking it public are looking too far into an uncertain future</td>
      <td>Is electric-vehicle company Lucid Motors worth $11.75 billion, $24 billion or $57 billion? The one thing investors can be sure of is that the lower the valuation they buy at, the better their chances of making returns.<br />Lucid, one of the most promising startups trying to follow Tesla’s lead in EVs, announced a merger late Monday with Churchill Capital IV or CCIV, a special-purpose acquisition company founded by Michael Klein. Bloomberg reported talks last month, and since then the market value of CCIV, which consists of $2.1 billion in cash, has ballooned to $9.1 billion amid much discussion on Reddit. As the deal allocated CCIV shareholders 16.1% of Lucid’s equity, the implied market value of the combined companies is now roughly $57 billion—even excluding the impact of shares and warrants held by Michael Klein and his team that are due to vest.<br />That valuation, which compares to about $45 billion for  Ford Motor ,  was even higher before the transaction was officially announced: CCIV shares plunged 39% Tuesday. It was a rough day for Tesla’s stock too, particularly in the morning, as investors weighed the prospect of rising interest rates and a consequent “rotation” away from expensive tech shares. Yet the terms of the transaction—notably some valuation numbers backed by hardheaded negotiations—may also have helped sober CCIV investors up.<br />CCIV agreed to pay $11.75 billion for Lucid’s existing business. Add the blank-check company’s $2.1 billion in cash and another $2.5 billion in cash from institutional investors and you get postdeal equity of $16.3 billion. But the company also cited a valuation of $24 billion. This is because the institutional investors agreed to buy into CCIV at $15 a share—a 50% premium to its net asset value but far below its current share price. Apply that premium to the entire equity and you get roughly $24 billion.<br />What all these numbers spell out is that different investors are buying Lucid at different prices. Those who invested in CCIV at the outset are paying the least. Institutions such as Fidelity and  BlackRock  that are getting shares through the secondary fundraising are paying more. And anyone who buys CCIV stock now is paying by far the most, even after Tuesday’s correction.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A decision on whether raising the minimum wage as part of President Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief package is acceptable under the Senate’s rules is expected as soon as Wednesday, kicking off what could be a fraught negotiation among Democrats on the provision.<br />Staff for both Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans are set to meet Wednesday morning with Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough over the proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, a plank of Mr. Biden’s relief plan.<br />Democrats are using a process called reconciliation to pass the aid package with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes required for most legislation. But reconciliation also comes with Senate rules on what proposals can be approved under the special procedure—including that the provision be directly tied to the budget. The nonpartisan parliamentarian will hear arguments from both parties and is expected to make a ruling on Wednesday or Thursday on the question.<br />A favorable ruling from the parliamentarian on raising the minimum wage through reconciliation will open the door for lawmakers to increase the federal minimum wage for the first time since 2009. But then Democrats will have to agree on exactly how to do so.<br />“It will be a whole caucus discussion because you still have to have 50 votes,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), a proponent of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, said.</td>

When I finally looked up in the Echo Show’s direction, it had turned to meet my gaze. As I walked back over, the screen panned again. In the morning light, I could see the device’s pea-size, motion-detecting camera challenging me to a staring contest I’d never win.<br />After experiencing the auto-tracking technology for the first time, I felt a mix of awe and dread. Not only can  Amazon ’s  devices see and hear us—now, they can follow us, too. It doesn’t have wheels. It’s more like a dog who watches you get kibble from the pantry as he sits like a good boy.<br />The Echo Show 10, which begins shipping Thursday, has a 10.1-inch screen connected by a robot arm. At $250, it’s also the company’s most expensive Echo.<br />Like other Alexa devices, this one can set timers and control your smart lightbulbs. And as a speaker, it sounds great. But the main idea is that its screen is visible whenever you look up, displaying your  Netflix  show or the next step in a recipe. And if you’re multitasking on a video call, the camera and robot arm will keep you in frame.<br />At first, the autonomously moving screen was more creepy than cool. After a few days, that unnerving feeling dissipated. At some point, the robo-screen actually started to make sense.</td>

At the time, the firm was attracted to what it saw as a relatively low level of technology adoption among water utilities compared with other industries such as healthcare or finance, according to partner Arvindh Kumar, who joined EQT in early 2020 to lead the firm’s U.S. investments in technology, media and telecommunications.<br />“We thought that over a longer period of time it [would be] a very attractive market where there would be growth and adoption of technology solutions to help utilities,” Mr. Kumar said.</td>

      <td>Concerns about Slack acquisition have weighed on the stock ahead of year-end results</td>
      <td>Salesforce . com has been in the doghouse with investors before. The way out this time will require a bit more attention to the bottom line.<br />The cloud software pioneer that is perennially in growth and deal mode announced its biggest move yet three months ago. That was the acquisition of  Slack Technologies —a messaging and collaboration platform for businesses that is popular but has yet to turn a profit. At $27.7 billion, Slack was nearly twice the size of Salesforce’s second-largest deal, which was the acquisition of Tableau Software in mid-2019. The deal also capped a run in which Salesforce acquired 28 companies in a five-year span, with reported values totaling $54.3 billion, according to FactSet.<br />Slack, in other words, was just the latest in a long string of deals that have grown more expensive over the years. But investors have taken a particularly dim view of the transaction. Salesforce shares have shed nearly 10% of their value since The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks between the two companies on Nov. 25. That contrasts with a 6% gain for the S&P 500 Software & Services Group and a 17% rise by the BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index over the same period. The price tag represented about 26 times Slack’s projected revenue for the next 12 months—more than twice the multiple paid for Tableau—and Salesforce didn’t even face competition on the deal, according to regulatory filings detailing the background of the merger.<br />That provides a challenging setup coming into Salesforce’s fiscal fourth-quarter results, scheduled for Thursday afternoon. The quarter is typically a strong period for the business, historically representing at least 45% of the company’s billings for the full fiscal year. But investors have been concerned about the rationale for the Slack deal, and the impact it will have on Salesforce’s margins. Slack is projected to show about $47 million in operating losses for the fiscal year ended January. An investor survey by Bernstein Research in December showed 84% of respondents believed the deal to be “value destructive” for Salesforce investors.<br />Salesforce already included Slack in its initial projection of 21% revenue growth for the fiscal year ending next January, so the potential for further upside from top-line growth guidance may be limited.</td>

Her decision is expected Wednesday or Thursday, according to lawmakers and aides.<br />Reconciliation is designed to help lawmakers pass legislation tied to the budget quickly with just 51 votes, rather than the 60 required for most bills to advance. That means Democrats will be able to pass the bill without any GOP votes, so long as they don’t lose any Democrats.<br />To qualify for the special fast-track procedures, measures have to be directly tied to the budget. Specifically, they have to have a meaningful fiscal impact that can’t be “merely incidental” to the policy proposal. If not, the provision can be challenged under the “Byrd rule,” named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.).<br />The Byrd rule also prevents any provision of the bill from adding to the deficit beyond the bill’s budgetary window, unless lawmakers find a way to offset its cost through the committee that has jurisdiction over that provision.</td>

Associates Inc., an investment research firm. The more conservative approach is to recognize the cost, note the legal dispute and reverse the cost later if the company prevails, he said.</td>

      <td>Technology companies that prospered over the course of the pandemic have less appeal as the economy recovers</td>
      <td>Rising long-term Treasury yields ultimately might not pose much of a problem for most stocks. But the bout of indigestion that higher yields are already giving to some of the past year’s biggest winners—shares of companies including  Amazon.com ,   Apple ,   Tesla  and  Microsoft —could prove more lasting.<br />Some of that is because these companies’ steep valuations make them vulnerable to rising yields. But it also stems from how, even as the Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc, those stocks did so well.<br />With the daily tally of new Covid-19 cases falling rapidly, millions of vaccine doses going into arms each week and another round of government support looking as if it is on its way, a return to something like normal in the months ahead is looking more and more likely. And with that prospect of recovery, bond investors have become less enamored with the safety of long-term Treasurys, pushing rates higher. The 10-year note’s yield is now 1.36%, compared with 0.88% just three months ago, marking its highest level in a year.<br />For most U.S. companies, the all-clear signal that the Treasury market has started sounding is a good thing. As Americans get back to doing things like eating out at restaurants, heading out on vacations and going to the mall, sales could flourish. Considering how much money has built up in a lot of people’s bank accounts during the pandemic and how much pent-up demand there is for all the things they did before the pandemic, there could be a bit of a boom.<br />For the shares of those companies, on the other hand, the rise in long-term rates provides a bit of a challenge: The higher that yields go, the more competitive bonds are with stocks. The challenge is hardly insurmountable, however, considering that the better economy that yields are heralding makes for better profits. That is why as often as not in recent years, periods of rising Treasury yields coincide with stocks rising, too.</td>

      <td>Competition in the electricity-supply business promised reliable power at a more affordable cost</td>
      <td>Texas’s deregulated electricity market, which was supposed to provide reliable power at a lower price, left millions in the dark last week. For two decades, its customers have paid more for electricity than state residents who are served by traditional utilities, a Wall Street Journal analysis has found.<br />Nearly 20 years ago, Texas shifted from using full-service regulated utilities to generate power and deliver it to consumers. The state deregulated power generation, creating the system that failed last week. And it required nearly 60% of consumers to buy their electricity from one of many retail power companies, rather than a local utility.<br />Those deregulated Texas residential consumers paid $28 billion more for their power since 2004 than they would have paid at the rates charged to the customers of the state’s traditional utilities, according to the Journal’s analysis of data from the federal Energy Information Administration.<br />The crisis last week was driven by the power producers. Now that power has largely been restored, attention has turned to retail electric companies, a few of which are hitting consumers with steep bills. Power prices surged to the market price cap of $9,000 a megawatt hour for several days during the crisis, a feature of the state’s system designed to incentivize power plants to supply more juice. Some consumers who chose variable rate power plans from retail power companies are seeing the big bills.<br />None of this was supposed to happen under deregulation. Backers of competition in the electricity-supply business promised it would lower prices for consumers who could shop around for the best deals, just as they do for cellphone service. The system would be an improvement over monopoly utilities, which have little incentive to innovate and provide better service to customers, supporters of deregulation said.</td>

      <td>State officials across the U.S. have grappled for months with the budgetary effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, some governors are proposing tax increases.<br />Prominent proposals include calls to raise billions of dollars across several states through taxes on the income and capital gains of higher earners.<br />Unlike the federal government, states generally can’t borrow to plug budget holes. After accounting for existing federal aid, states might need to come up with about $56 billion in spending cuts or revenue increases to balance their budgets through the fiscal year that ends in most states in June 2022, according to an estimate from Moody’s Analytics.<br />Budgetary pressures vary greatly among states, despite calls for more federal aid in general and tax hikes in some locales. In New York, state revenue collected from April through December 2020 was 4.1% lower than in the year-earlier period, according to data from the Urban Institute think tank.<br />In New Jersey, the drop was 2.4%. With tax revenue outperforming earlier projections, Gov. Phil Murphy on Tuesday proposed making a full payment to the state’s pension system for the first time since 1996. California has done even better, with revenue collections growing 1.2%, boosted by strong earnings for high-income taxpayers and a rallying stock market.</td>

      <td>Visa Inc.  and  Mastercard Inc.  are planning to raise swipe fees for some types of credit-card purchases in April, adding to the squeeze felt by restaurants, retailers and other merchants already struggling through the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />What’s more, customers’ switch to online shopping during the pandemic—a trend heralded for keeping businesses afloat when people are reluctant to venture inside stores—is also creating extra costs for merchants. Swipe fees, which merchants pay when a customer pays by card, are often higher on online purchases.<br />The swipe fees, known as interchange fees in industry parlance, are a perpetual source of contention between merchants and card companies. Though invisible to consumers, they are glaring to merchants, which often end up paying fees of about 2% of their customers’ credit-card purchases. The fees are set by the card networks, such as Visa and Mastercard. Merchants pay them to the banks that issue the cards.<br />Cash use as a share of U.S. payments has been declining for years, but merchants say Covid-19 has accelerated the shift. Even customers who are shopping in stores are shunning cash during the pandemic, which also means more swipe fees for businesses.<br />Savage Race, a small business that organizes obstacle-course races, has seen sales plummet during the coronavirus.

Investors said a rise in government bond yields, driven by improving growth prospects and rising inflation expectations, has accelerated a rotation out of the tech stocks that led markets higher during the pandemic, and into the stocks best placed to benefit from an end to lockdowns.<br />“This really is a function of economies reopening,” said Brian O’Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum Investment Funds. “Bond yields are rising because of good vaccination rates in the U.S. and U.K. and it’s prompting a simple rotation away from everything that did well last year, the stay-at-home stocks, to the ones that didn’t, the go-outside stocks.”<br />“It’s a good story in some ways, in that the market is trying to price in that economies are going to reopen,” he added.</td>

      <td>Myanmar’s coup highlights the awkward dynamics for foreign businesses involved in countries where the armed forces have their own business interests</td>
      <td>The military seizure of power in Myanmar doesn’t just have political and diplomatic implications, but economic ones too.<br />Though rare in the West, heavy military involvement in nondefense parts of the economy is commonplace in many parts of the world. The recent events in Myanmar show some of the awkward dynamics for foreign businesses that get involved in countries where the armed forces have their own business interests, and how the military can be a drag on prosperity.<br />From the outside, it might seem obvious that military involvement in the economy is a bad thing: Generals aren’t businessmen and may use their clout to intimidate potential competitors or otherwise extract economic rents. That isn’t accurate in every case. During President Park Chung-hee’s military dictatorship in South Korea, an authoritarian central government facilitated development even when most of the actual business was technically in private hands. A rich seam of contracts for material during the Vietnam War helped to fuel the growth of some chaebols, such as Hyundai.<br />But in other cases, it is clear that skeptics’ instincts are pretty much on the money. In Egypt, for example, the military directly or indirectly employs millions of civilians, but without any concrete strategy for development—a more clear-cut case of rent extraction from the productive parts of the economy. Research published by the Center for Comparative and International Studies based on more than 100 countries suggests that benefits of GDP growth from democratization decline when the military has more political power, and are fully erased in cases where the armed forces are particularly influential.<br />The truth is that there are far more situations in the world where a powerful military contributes to Egypt-like outcomes than South Korea-like outcomes. Myanmar is certainly one of the former. The country’s GDP per capita, adjusted for purchasing-power parity, was a little over $5,000 last year, less than half of Vietnamese and Indonesian levels, two countries that aren’t wealthy even by regional standards.</td>

      <td>A showdown in Australia is being watched as a test case for the rest of the world</td>
      <td>Facebook Inc.  on Tuesday agreed to restore news to its platform in Australia, following a five-day blackout that came amid a standoff with the country’s government over a proposal that would force tech companies to pay news publishers for content.<br />The current showdown, which also involves  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google, represents the boiling over of a long-simmering question around the world: Should big tech platforms have to pay publishers for the news articles that populate their sites?<br />Google and Facebook say they help publishers by delivering traffic. In their view, requiring the tech companies to pay to display news content violates the principles of open linking that make the web work. Publishers say that the primary reason they don’t get paid is the power imbalance between them and the tech platforms, whose role in the distribution of their stories is so important that publishers feel they have little choice but to assent to tech companies’ terms.<br />Copyright laws differ by country, but in the U.S. the news headlines and snippets turned up in Google searches are typically considered a fair use of that content under copyright law—meaning that a company can display those snippets without having to negotiate a license fee from the copyright holder. Determining what should count as fair use is complicated; it includes weighing such factors as whether a news snippet on a tech platform could be considered a replacement for the full article, which would harm the publisher.<br />Whether Google’s and Facebook’s current use of news content is fair use isn’t known because the courts haven’t tried a case. A key legal decision from 2007 offers a guiding principle for what copyright lawyers expect today. In that case, Perfect 10, a publisher of pornography, had sued Google, claiming the thumbnail photographs indexed in Google’s image search had hurt its business. The Ninth Circuit sided with Google, primarily because it saw Google’s search engine as a “pointer” to Perfect 10’s content, not a replacement for it.</td>

The matter also raises questions about which publishers should get paid for news content and how much.<br />Facebook’s deal with Australia gives it a path to avoid required payments to publishers for news content, so long as the company works toward reaching agreements with publishers on its own accord.<br />“We appreciate the government has created flexibility to move forward making deals with publishers, while giving us 30 days’ notice before a designation,” said Campbell Brown, Facebook’s vice president of global news partnerships. If Facebook’s negotiations with individual Australian publishers fail to satisfy the government, the company could reimpose its news ban rather than be forced to comply with the new law’s terms for setting payments.<br />“I am hopeful there will not be a need for that step,” Ms. Brown said.</td>

      <td>Biden’s regulators are ignoring the electrical grid’s vulnerability.</td>
      <td>You’d think the Texas blackouts would trigger some soul-searching about the vulnerability of America’s electrical grid. Not in today’s hothouse of climate politics. The Biden Administration is already moving to stop an examination of grid vulnerability to promote unreliable renewable energy sources.<br />Regulators have been warning for years that the grid is becoming shakier as cheap natural gas and heavily subsidized renewables replace steady coal and nuclear baseload power. “The nation’s power grid will be stressed in ways never before experienced” due to “an unprecedented resource-mix change,” the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warned in 2011.<br />It added: “Environmental regulations are shown to be the number one risk to reliability over the next one to five years.” But the Obama Federal Energy Regulatory Commission(FERC) refused to consider how climate policies would affect reliability. Since 2011 about 90 gigawatts (GW) of coal capacity have shut down, replaced by some 120 GW of wind and solar and 60 GW of gas power capacity.<br />But renewables don’t generate power around-the-clock as gas, nuclear and coal do. Gas plants depend on just-in-time fuel deliveries, which aren’t reliable in extreme weather. Government-made pipeline bottlenecks constrain deliveries in the Northeast. Liberals also say Texas could have better weathered the Arctic blast if its grid didn’t rely almost entirely on in-state power.<br />But the Southwest Power Pool, north of Texas, and the Midwest power grid—both of which rely heavily on wind backed by gas—also experienced power outages last week due to declining surging demand, wind production and gas shortages. California relies on gas and imports to back up its solar power. But last summer California couldn’t get enough power from its neighbors amid a heat wave that strained the entire Western grid. Hydropower from the Northwest and coal from Utah couldn’t stop blackouts.</td>

      <td>A new journal from students who refuse to be cancelled.</td>
      <td>Most college administrators are no doubt exhausted by constant student demands that range from the type of cereal served in the dining hall to the latest intersectional fad. So those running the University of Chicago must be pleasantly surprised by the arrival of Chicago Thinker on their campus this school year. It’s an online journal by conservative and libertarian students who refuse to be canceled.<br />Their mission statement makes the point: “We demand not to be coddled. Embracing the experience of unfettered inquiry and free expression is precisely the point of these years of intense study: to rigorously confront and challenge our most deeply-held beliefs—and to emerge from the experience as more thoughtful, informed human beings.”<br />They build on a firm foundation. In 2015 the university released a statement reaffirming its commitment to “free, robust, and uninhibited debate and deliberation.” In 2016 the university’s incoming freshman received a letter informing them that “we do not support so-called trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial and we do not condone the creation of intellectual safe spaces where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.”<br />The Chicago Thinker’s latest posts include stories on the “insane COVID rules and snitch culture” at today’s universities, a definition of conservatism offered “in defiance of egregious caricatures,” and a piece on “how leftism ruined ‘Stargirl,’” a superhero TV series based on the character from DC Comics. Good for the Chicago Thinker—and even more for the university that promises never to coddle the students running the publication.</td>

Grid failures will only become more common as the left continues to sabotage America’s No. 1 power source.<br />Prior to starting graduate school, I worked as an engineer on natural-gas pipelines in Texas. I saw how a radical, antiscience faction on the political left does everything in its power to make building, operating and maintaining gas pipelines prohibitively difficult. Pandering to these activists and voters, Democratic leaders impede natural-gas projects through punitive regulations, endless reviews and flat-out refusals to approve new projects. Ironically, those quickest to blame natural gas for this current crisis in Texas are the ones who have worked the hardest to create barriers to the improvement, modernization and expansion of America’s pipelines.</td>

Ms. James launched the investigation into Mr. Prude’s death thereafter.<br />On March 23, Rochester Police Department officers took Mr. Prude, who had a history of mental illness, into custody after responding to reports of a person acting erratically. Mr. Prude died in a hospital seven days later.<br />The Monroe County Office of the Medical Examiner ruled Mr. Prude’s death a homicide. The autopsy report concluded he died of asphyxiation “in the setting of physical restraint” and acute intoxication with the hallucinogenic drug PCP.</td>

      <td>Gov. Lamont makes a smart decision to base eligibility on age.</td>
      <td>‘I’m going to focus on the old business motto, KISS: Keep it simple, stupid.” That’s how Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont put it Monday in announcing his decision to base Covid-19 vaccine eligibility strictly on age. The more states prioritize social “equity,” the more complicated and inequitable vaccine distribution becomes.<br />After seniors older than age 65, Connecticut had planned to vaccinate “essential workers” and younger people with underlying health conditions like diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recommended these groups be prioritized to “mitigate health inequities” and “promote justice.” Younger minorities are more likely to be “essential workers” and have comorbidities.<br />But as Mr. Lamont explained, “A lot of complications result from states that tried to finely slice the salami and it got very complicated to administer. . . The CDC said grocery and food service workers [get priority]. Then we started getting calls of, ‘I’m not in a grocery [store] but I’m in a convenience store and it’s a convenience store that serves . . . we have doughnuts, we have coffee, we have food.’ How about, ‘I’m a big box store, but I also have food; I think we should all be prioritized as well.’ . . . Those are the type of questions we had. And it was very difficult.”<br />Or how about people a few pounds short of the public-health definition of obesity? If they ate more doughnuts, could they qualify?<br />The Democratic Governor is right that complexity is the enemy of speed. It’s also the enemy of equity. Decisions about who is or isn’t an “essential worker” are arbitrary. Many people in their early 60s are retired, including large numbers of public-safety workers.</td>

      <td>Investigators are trying to understand interplay between broken fan blades and engine cowling, which was ripped away</td>
      <td>The midair breakdown of a jet engine that spewed a trail of metal over a Colorado town is putting regulatory focus on the design and strength of engine coverings.<br />Four minutes into the Honolulu-bound United Airlines flight from Denver on Saturday, pilots and passengers heard a loud bang, and the plane’s right engine began vibrating, according to the National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary analysis of the cockpit’s voice recorder. Within 20 minutes, the plane had landed on the runway back at Denver International Airport, with no injuries to anyone on the ground or aboard the plane.<br />However, large pieces of debris plunged from the sky, landing in yards and a soccer field. Photos and videos taken by passengers show the airplane’s right engine, stripped of its front coverings, oscillating and in flames.<br />Investigators have homed in on a fan blade that had weakened over time and broke off at its base. That fast-spinning blade remnant appears to have sheared a second blade roughly in half. But investigators are still trying to understand why the engine’s front external cover, known as the cowling, was then ripped away, according to NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt. Something similar happened in a handful of other engine failures caused by broken fan blades in recent years.<br />“Certainly, we don’t expect the cowling to separate like that,” Mr. Sumwalt said this week, during a briefing with reporters. He added that the safety board’s investigators would examine the engine’s maintenance and inspection records.</td>

      <td>Stories of decline, reform and survival in a post-Fukushima Japan already hobbled by economic stagnation and an aging society.</td>
      <td>Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, Japan was buffeted by crises. Economic stagnation left the country with dim prospects. An aging society compounded the problem. Younger Japanese barely remember the era of wealth that catapulted their nation to the world’s No. 2 position.<br />Nature struck an even deeper blow to the country’s psyche. On March 11, 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake occurred off the northeastern coast of Honshu, triggering a devastating tsunami. More than a quarter million people were displaced and nearly 20,000 were killed. A meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant followed. The world watched in horror as the greater Tokyo area, with a population of 38 million, seemed at risk. The Japanese people averted that nightmare, but 10 years later the trauma of what could have been still lingers.<br />In “Every Human Intention: Japan in the New Century,” American journalist Dreux Richard offers an eclectic collage of stories about Japan in the decade since the earthquake. Three complex dilemmas organize Mr. Richard’s idea of Japan: decline, diaspora (or immigration) and reform.<br />The strongest in the series are the stories from Japan’s increasingly depopulated rural towns. Mr. Richard visits the port city of Wakkanai, on the northernmost tip of the country. Once a thriving economy, Wakkanai has declined as the region’s fishing stock was depleted and trade with the nearby Russian island of Sakhalin evaporated. Mr. Richard presents a rich array of voices to capture the city’s public-policy challenges as well as the plight of its elderly. Efforts at revitalization are regularly rebuffed. “I’m annoyed by the notion that people in Wakkanai should feel chastened,” laments the city’s former mayor, Yokota Kōichi, “that a city in decline should dare nothing.”<br />To explore the difficulties faced by Japan’s African immigrants—which officially number almost 22,000 but are estimated to be up to twice that with visa overstayers—Mr. Richard relies mostly on Prosper Anyalechi, a permanent resident from Nigeria who has been in Tokyo since 1991, to tell his own story. Expectations for Mr. Richard’s insights ought to be high, as the author reported extensively on the subject for the Japan Times newspaper between 2011 and 2016. According to Mr. Richard, few African migrants have more than a tenuous claim to a home in Japan; most live in isolation away from the society that hosts them. They have limited access to legal visas, and many who seek opportunity there end up staying beyond the term of their permits.</td>

      <td>All people are created equal, but Congress is considering a bill that would make some people more equal than others.<br />H.R. 5, styled the Equality Act, would redefine “sex” under federal civil-rights laws to include “sexual orientation” and “gender identity,” overriding basic biology along with millennia of tradition.<br />This isn’t only a question of semantics. Nor is it merely an attempt to prohibit employment discrimination against sexual minorities. A 2020 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court already does that.<br />The Equality Act would go much further by making it illegal to distinguish “identity” from biology and thereby prioritize transgender people over women. By erasing sex as a distinct legal category, the measure threatens to open up female-only spaces and opportunities designed to increase representation for girls to biological men, which can endanger the safety of women and girls.<br />The Equality Act would threaten the existence of women’s prisons, public-school girls’ locker rooms, and women’s and girls’ sports teams. It would limit freedom of speech, freedom of association, accurate data collection, and scientific inquiry. It would threaten the rights of physicians who doubt the wisdom of performing life-changing, reproduction-limiting procedures, and parents who seek to protect their minor children from such treatment.</td>

      <td>The ex-senator had said he might seek the Republican nomination</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Former Republican Sen. David Perdue of Georgia said he wouldn’t seek a return to the Senate in 2022, one week after announcing he was exploring a bid and filing early paperwork to do so.<br />“After much prayer and reflection, Bonnie and I have decided that we will not enter the race for the United States Senate in Georgia in 2022. This is a personal decision, not a political one,” Mr. Perdue said in an email to supporters Tuesday, referring to his wife. “I am confident that whoever wins the Republican primary next year will defeat the Democrat candidate in the general election for this seat, and I will do everything I can to make that happen.”<br />Mr. Perdue lost a runoff race for re-election in January to his Democratic opponent, now-Sen. Jon Ossoff. The runoff was needed because, in Georgia, statewide officials must win more than 50% of the vote—a threshold no Senate candidate cleared in November.<br />In his statement, Mr. Perdue said that he would work with Georgia officials to “correct the inequities in our state laws and election rules.” Top state election officials, many of whom are Republicans, have said the November elections and subsequent runoffs were conducted fairly.<br />The announcement came after Mr. Perdue said last week that he would consider running for the seat now held by Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who defeated Republican Kelly Loeffler in a different runoff last month. Mr. Warnock must run again because his race was a special election to fill the remainder of a term vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson, who retired due to illness. Mr. Ossoff was elected to a full, six-year term.</td>

      <td>Macron and Merkel respond coolly to Biden, and public opinion backs them.</td>
      <td>President Biden set out to declare a triumphant U.S. return to the trans-Atlantic alliance. “America is back,” the president said in his speech this week to the Munich Security Conference. The leaders of France and Germany promptly made it clear that the four years of the Trump presidency had changed the relationship.<br />France’s President Emmanuel Macron renewed his call for Europe’s “strategic autonomy,” which would require the Continent to be prepared to defend itself. Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel bluntly stated that the interests of the U.S. and Europe wouldn’t always converge, which most listeners took as a reference to the European Union’s recent trade pact with China, along with Germany’s determination to complete the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline from Russia. The U.S. may be back, but it can’t expect to reclaim its old seat at the head of the table.<br />Underlying the muted response to Mr. Biden’s speech is what the European Council on Foreign Relations calls a “massive change” in European public opinion toward the U.S. The group’s recent poll finds: “Majorities in key member states now think the US political system is broken, that China will be more powerful than the US within a decade, and that Europeans cannot rely on the US to defend them.”<br />These beliefs are driving fundamental changes in European policy preferences. “Large numbers think Europeans should invest in their own defense,” the poll found, “and look to Berlin rather than Washington as their most important partner. They want to be tougher with the US on economic issues. And, rather than aligning with Washington, they want their countries to stay neutral in a conflict between the US and Russia or China”—a stance endorsed by at least half the electorate in each of the 11 countries surveyed.<br />In every country except Poland and Hungary, pluralities agreed with the statement that after voting for Donald Trump in 2016, the American people can no longer be trusted. In Germany, a majority endorsed this sentiment.</td>

      <td>Why an antitrust exemption for news outlets is better than Australia’s scheme.</td>
      <td>Hey Australia, the 1830s called and they want their media business model back.<br />It sounds terrible to modern ears, but in the early days of the newspaper industry, the “party press era,” papers were PR organs. Their job was to win elections and capture lucrative government advertising. Australia apparently seeks to create a similar dynamic, albeit with a legal and regulatory cloak thrown over it. Why should we care? Because legislators everywhere are watching closely. They see the same opening to suborn—er, support—a free press made vulnerable by the collapse in digital ad revenues. Our own venerated Sen. Bernie Sanders is among them.<br />Australia’s rationale is disingenuous even by political standards, exploiting the unpopularity of Google and  Facebook  as a foil. No matter how often it is insinuated otherwise, the U.S. internet ad giants do not steal newspaper content; they send millions of readers to newspaper websites every day and help them generate billions of dollars in ad views.<br />The problem is that the advertising these readers see doesn’t pay nearly as well as advertising did in pre-internet days. This isn’t Google’s and Facebook’s fault but Australia’s Parliament nevertheless would put the onus on them to compensate publishers for the fact that their news products, while still valued by readers, no longer are valued quite so highly by advertisers.<br />Google promptly surrendered, recognizing a threat by politicians to dictate its core search results. It agreed to funnel payments to local media owners through a different window, greasing them for participating in a separate project called News Showcase. (The Journal’s publisher is a recipient of such a deal.) This seems to have satisfied the politicians for now.</td>

Earlier this month, Noel Quintana, a 61-year-old native of Manila, was slashed in the face with a box cutter while commuting to work on a crowded subway car. He survived but required about 100 stitches to close his wounds. Other victims have been less fortunate.<br />In Milwaukee last September, a 36-year-old Hmong American named Ee Lee was sexually assaulted in a city park and died at a hospital from “blunt force trauma to her head.” The suspects fled on bicycles.<br />In San Francisco last month, Vicha Ratanapakdee, 84 and originally from Thailand, was on his regular morning walk when a passerby knocked him to the ground and ran away. Ratanapakdee died from his injuries a few days later. Across the Bay, in Oakland’s Chinatown, police have documented an uptick in assaults, particularly on the elderly. On Jan. 31, a man was caught on camera in separate incidents approaching a 91-year-old man and 55-year-old woman from behind and shoving them to the pavement. The woman lost consciousness.<br />“It’s not unique to Chinatown or to the Asian community, the increase in crime we’ve seen across the city and across the county,” said the district attorney for Alameda County, which includes Oakland, at a news conference earlier this month. “But we have seen in the last several weeks and month a very specific increase in crimes committed against Asians.”</td>
