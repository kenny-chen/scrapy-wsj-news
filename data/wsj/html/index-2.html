      <td>Trade deal will lessen early turbulence, but disruption comes at a challenging time</td>
      <td>LONDON—The free-trade agreement that the U.K. struck with the European Union on Christmas Eve will heap new challenges onto a British economy that has performed worse than its peers through 2020.<br />While avoiding a trade disruption of the magnitude that would have followed if efforts to reach a deal had failed, the new agreement is the first in history that will throw more obstacles in the way of importers and exporters. That is happening as the U.K. copes with a fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus that has forced lockdowns over most of the country.<br />On Christmas Day, ambassadors from the 27 EU countries met in Brussels to begin scrutinizing the agreement, ahead of its expected approval by governments next week. The British Parliament is set to meet on Dec. 30 to ratify the accord.<br />It will take effect with the U.K. and economies across the world already straining under the pandemic and governments’ efforts to contain it. The U.K. has been among the worst-hit economies, with gross domestic product at the end of the third quarter almost 10% less than it was a year earlier.<br />Britain will have to adjust to the new relationship with the EU as it simultaneously deals with the economic pain caused by the virus. That risks hindering a recovery, economists and business executives say, with unpredictable consequences for jobs and livelihoods as businesses adapt to the upheavals of both challenges.</td>

I cannot put myself before others, putting the laws of the market and patents above the laws of love and the health of humanity.”<br />“I plead with all the leaders of states, businesses and international organizations to promote cooperation and not competition and to seek a solution for all, vaccines for all, especially the most vulnerable and needy,” he added.</td>

      <td>Britain discovers that trade talks are about power; the EU is a much more important market to the U.K. than vice versa</td>
      <td>LONDON—Since Britain’s 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union, the U.K. government has said its aim is reclaiming sovereignty—the ability to set its own rules for its own benefit.<br />As the country began negotiating its future economic relations with the bloc this year, the British chief negotiator, David Frost, said all the U.K. wanted was “a modern free-trade agreement between sovereign and autonomous equals.”<br />Sovereignty may mean the constitutional independence to make decisions, accountable only to your own people and without reference to others. But sovereignty isn’t the same as equality and in international affairs, other nations’ objectives must be taken into account.<br />And in international affairs, power matters, as the just-concluded pact between the U.K. and the EU shows. The EU is a much more important market to the U.K., accounting for some 43% of its exports, than the U.K. is to the EU as a whole or to any individual EU country.<br />That asymmetry meant the EU could extract a price from the U.K. for tariff-free access to the bloc that it didn’t demand of Canada and Japan—less important potential competitors than the U.K.—in past free-trade deals. That price was a U.K. agreement not to undercut EU standards in areas like labor, the environment and subsidies to the private sector.</td>

      <td>Max Weber’s ‘Athletic Contest’ features a mix of new ideas, formal experiments and theories then current in advanced art.</td>
      <td>Well into the 1960sMax Weber (1881-1961) was the most famous early modernist in America. Since then, Marsden Hartley, Georgia O’Keeffe and Arthur Dove have been accorded top places in our history. However, from 1909 to 1919, he produced some of the greatest paintings ever made in this country. There is now a fine Weber on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the remarkable “Athletic Contest.”<br /><br />Initially titled “Interscholastic Runners,” it was painted in 1915 when Weber was at the peak of his powers. The painting is a challenging compendium of the new ideas, formal experiments and theories then current in advanced art, made personal and distinctly American. The work serves as a virtual laboratory of artistic pragmatism in which Weber, like so many other American artists, took only what he needed from European art. Weber’s Cubism of the 1910s incorporated his interest in other contemporary art movements and philosophies. Equally contemporary, his subjects were drawn from New York’s fast-paced, complex life.<br />In “Athletic Contest” he cast cyclists, runners, spectators and a pole vaulter as flattened forms jostling on overlapping planes, reflecting his interest in the simultaneity of time and place, fusing memories and experiences. The painting swirls with nonstop energy, catching the unceasing activity of life and reflecting Weber’s keen awareness of Italian Futurism. Weber was also drawing upon the influential writings of Henri Bergson (1859-1941), who rejected the Impressionist emphasis on the single moment in time and considered time as a fluid continuity—la durée—that fused past, present and future.<br />Weber once said of his work, “I painted motion.” Here he deployed dynamic, Futurist “force lines” to convey speed and a repetition of forms to suggest sequential motion, inspired by the photographic studies of Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey, well known to Futurists and many other artists at this time, as well as Marcel Duchamp’s radical “Nude Descending a Staircase.” Prime examples of this technique are the runner portrayed by a line of four heads at the top of Weber’s painting and the motion of the pole vaulter at the center. Here and in other works, there are clear references to cinematic movement. Over time, Futurism was as great an influence as Cubism on Weber’s work of this period.</td>

In addition, he or she will have to decide whether to continue to pursue some civil lawsuits filed by the Trump Justice Department that some officials viewed as more aligned with the president’s personal interests than with those of the federal government.<br />While Mr. Biden has yet to name his nominee for attorney general, he has said he intends to leave tough calls about politically fraught probes to his top prosecutor, which aides say is meant to signal a departure from what they see as the persistent undermining of the agency’s traditional independence from the White House under former Attorney General William Barr.<br />Mr. Barr departed from his post on Wednesday, and Mr. Trump appointed his deputy, Jeffrey Rosen, as acting attorney general. While current and former department officials don’t expect Mr. Rosen’s policies to differ greatly from Mr. Barr’s, his decisions in coming weeks could add to the challenges facing his successor.</td>

Many models from Japan’s top car makers—Toyota,  Honda Motor Co.  and  Nissan Motor Co. —come in both traditional and hybrid versions.<br />Earlier this month, Toyota President Akio Toyoda said that if Japan was too hasty in banning gasoline-powered cars and moving to electric vehicles, “the current business model of the car industry is going to collapse.” He was speaking on behalf of Japanese car makers in his role as head of a local industry association.<br />Mr. Toyoda said the electricity grid couldn’t handle extra summer demand and observed that most of Japan’s electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels.</td>

      <td>The initial Covid-19 shock has faded, but assuming that things are back to normal in the $4 trillion municipal bond market would be a mistake.</td>
      <td>Investors in staid municipal bonds got a shock when the U.S. went into lockdown in March: Yields on some of the highest-quality issues ballooned to more than three times that of Treasurys of similar maturity. They usually are somewhat lower than those of Treasurys due to their tax advantages.<br />The dislocation didn’t last long, but assuming that things are back to normal in the $4 trillion market would be a mistake. There were two reasons for the big divergence: Investors rushed to own Uncle Sam’s liabilities—the safest, most-liquid securities in the world—to the exclusion of nearly everything else. But they also fretted that the collapse in commerce, travel and employment would crush state and local revenue.<br />“We have no money,” said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in a March radio interview at the height of this spring’s emergency.<br />New York’s situation now looks less dire, but the damage to it and other issuers is substantial. State tax collections nationwide were 6.4% lower between March and August against expected growth of 2% to 3%, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Cities were even worse off with an average 21% revenue drop since the pandemic began, according to a survey released this month by the National League of Cities. Meanwhile, the pandemic brought unexpected expenses.<br />The degree to which state and local coffers were hurt depended largely on how they raise money. Jurisdictions that rely largely on income taxes took a hit and those relying on tourist spending did even worse. Cities that fund themselves mostly on property taxes could be in fairly good shape as long as they aren’t dependent on struggling malls and office buildings.</td>

Combined, the two GOP campaigns hauled in $132 million between Oct. 15 and Dec. 16, the time period covered by the new reports.<br />Republican groups operating independently of the party and the candidates are helping to narrow the money gap in the pivotal races. If Democrats win both seats, the party would lead the White House and both legislative chambers—a fact the GOP has been playing up in its fundraising appeals and advertisements.<br />So far, the candidates, party committees and outside groups have spent more than $452 million on television, radio and some digital ads, according to ad tracker Kantar/CMAG. Some $84 million more in ad buys are planned through the Jan. 5 election.<br />Republicans are outpacing Democrats on TV largely thanks to a trio of big-spending outside groups with close ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: American Crossroads, the Senate Leadership Fund and Peachtree PAC.</td>

He had sided with Fidel Castro against the Batista dictatorship, for which he was jailed and beaten. But he later soured on Castro and was granted political asylum in the U.S.<br />Like so many people who have escaped political oppression, Mr. Cruz has a special appreciation for America and its freedoms. So why did his son recently block legislation on the Senate floor to open America’s door to people like his father—Hong Kongers now enduring a crackdown by another Communist government?<br />The legislation is “The Hong Kong People’s Freedom and Choice Act of 2020,” and it passed the House in early December by voice vote. The bill would make it easier for Hong Kongers to gain refugee or temporary protected status. TPS allows people from designated countries to remain and work in the United Status.<br />Mr. Cruz, who has supported Hong Kong’s democracy movement in the past, offers two main objections. First, he says the bill isn’t really about helping Hong Kong; it’s another Democratic effort to relax standards on behalf of “open borders.” Second, he says it would give China an opening to infiltrate spies into the U.S.<br />He prefers his own bill to cut off federal funding for Hollywood filmmakers who censor their films for screening in China. He is also pushing the Shame Act, which would sanction China for forced sterilizations and abortions directed at religious minorities such as the Muslim Uighurs.</td>

      <td>Political speech is under attack these days from Beijing to Berkeley, so we’ll take victories where we can get them. One arrived Tuesday when the University of Texas at Austin agreed to disband its PC police and end policies that suppress speech on campus.<br />Credit the nonprofit Speech First, which sued on behalf of student members in 2018. The group claimed UT and its officials had “created an elaborate investigatory and disciplinary apparatus to suppress, punish, and deter speech that other students deem ‘offensive,’ ‘biased,’ ‘uncivil,’ or ‘rude.’”<br />Students could anonymously report their professors and peers for “bias incidents” to the Campus Climate Response Team, which would investigate and threaten disciplinary referrals and “restorative justice” meetings with administrators. The university gave several examples of what constitutes an act of bias, including “faculty commentary in the classroom perceived as derogatory and insensitive,” and other behavior open to highly subjective judgments about what is offensive.<br />A federal judge dismissed the case in 2019. Citing that decision, university spokesman J.B. Bird said Wednesday that there was “no evidence students were disciplined, sanctioned or investigated for their speech” and that, “to the contrary,” there was “strong evidence of the university protecting the speech rights of conservative students and guests on campus.”<br />But Speech First appealed, and in October the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the ruling and remanded the case back to the district court. Circuit Court Judge Edith Jones blasted the bias-response team as “the clenched fist in the velvet glove of student speech regulation.”</td>

It was 1983, and he was on patrol in the 71st Precinct, in Crown Heights, a black-majority Brooklyn neighborhood.<br />“I’m right out of the academy,” he says. “I’m with a training officer. And we see a guy do a minor traffic infraction where maybe he and his regular partner wouldn’t have intervened.” But they stopped the driver so the callow Mr. McAuliffe could get practice pulling a car over and safely approaching it.<br />As officer and trainee moved toward the stationary vehicle, they saw a young boy—presumably the driver’s son—in the back seat. “I was supposed to do the talking,” Mr. McAuliffe recalls, “and the older cop was going to watch me. But he took over.” He told the driver to be more careful and said, “No, you don’t have to show me your license. Have a good night.” When the two got back to their squad car, the veteran told the rookie: “Never embarrass a guy in front of his kid.”<br />Such lessons, Mr. McAuliffe says, “are not being taught to cops these days.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—For the third year in a row, President Trump has given employees of the executive branch of the federal government a full day off on Christmas Eve, though Congress remained on the job Thursday morning.<br />When Christmas has fallen on a Friday, as it does this year, presidents have customarily given federal workers a half-day off on Dec. 24, as President Obama did in 2009 and 2015 and President Clinton did in 1998, according to Government Executive, a trade publication.<br />The federal government observes 11 permanent holidays established by law, including Christmas, but Christmas Eve isn’t among them.<br />About two million people, just over 1% of the U.S. workforce, are permanently employed by the federal government outside the military and the U.S. Postal Service, according to the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan public policy research organization. It wasn’t immediately known Thursday how many got the day off.<br />Some past presidents have given federal employees an extra day off when Dec. 25 falls on or near a weekend. President Bush excused federal employees from work on Christmas Eve in 2001 and 2007, when Christmas fell on a Tuesday, as it did in 2012, when Mr. Obama also called for a day off, Government Executive reported. In 2014, with Christmas on a Thursday, Mr. Obama granted workers a day off on Dec. 26.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Republicans blocked Democrats’ effort to pass legislation approving $2,000 stimulus checks for Americans by unanimous consent in the U.S. House, and countered with an attempt to cut foreign aid that was thwarted by Democrats in turn.<br />House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) made the request for Democrats. Rep. Rob Wittman (R., Va.) made Republicans’ request. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D., Mich.), presiding over the rare Christmas Eve session, said neither proposal had been “cleared by bipartisan floor and committee leadership” and therefore couldn't be “entertained”—confirming that leadership on each side of the aisle had objected to the other party’s proposed legislation.<br />The largely symbolic moves Thursday came in response to President Trump’s demand that lawmakers increase direct payments to Americans as part of massive legislation that combines a coronavirus relief package with a $1.4 trillion government funding bill. Mr. Trump called on lawmakers to increase the direct payments to $2,000 for individuals from $600 per adult and per child, the current level in the bipartisan bill. Congress overwhelmingly approved the legislation earlier this week, and Mr. Trump only publicly voiced his concerns after it passed.<br />In addition to complaining that the checks were too skimpy, Mr. Trump had criticized the spending portion of the 5,593-page year-end package, which includes routine funding for foreign allies and international programs. The foreign aid was in Mr. Trump’s budget and had been approved by the Republican-controlled Senate Appropriations Committee and by the majority of House Republicans as recently as Monday.<br />In a letter to his GOP colleagues on Wednesday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) of trying to “use the American people as leverage to make coronavirus relief contingent on government funding—which includes billions of foreign aid at a time when there are urgent needs at home.”</td>

      <td>WITH DESIGN museums and historic homes off-limits, these streaming series, premiering or returning in the next month, are a satisfying substitute for décor junkies.<br />This lavish new series from executive producer Shonda Rhimes follows the cream of British society as they traverse the ballrooms and gardens of 1815 London. Diverse casting and a tweak to Regency style bring this drawing-room drama into the 21st century. “It was all about creating a clean, fresh, colorful world modern audiences could relate to,” said production designer Will Hughes-Jones. For the old-money Bridgerton family, that meant a refined palette of blue, white and champagne, inspired by then-newly popular Wedgwood china. The bedroom in the upstart Featheringtons’ home, by comparison, illustrates their new-money flash: a gilt-frame mirror, damask on nearly every surface and the acid yellows and bright pinks favored by the family, part of a “heightened reimagining of the period.”<br />Most of the first season of this delightfully oddball show, which introduced poet Emily Dickinson (Hailee Steinfeld) as an angsty, goofy teen, took place in her parents’ staid 1850s New England home. This season shifts to the new estate of Emily’s brother Austin (Adrian Enscoe) and his wife, Sue (Ella Hunt). “It’s more of a Victorian Italianate villa, and it’s much more showy,” said production designer Neil Patel. Reflecting Sue’s aspirations, the parlor is decorated in regal blues, greens and golds, with a mix of Hudson River School and Old World art hung salon-style and a showstopping reclining sofa. Said Mr. Patel, “The design looks toward the most current European styles of the time.”<br />In this post-apocalyptic series with a bonkers premise—passengers are stuck in a train hurtling endlessly across the globe’s frozen dystopia—all the action takes place within 14-by-40-foot railcars comprising a slew of styles and periods. This first class apartment car (pictured), home to homicide detective Andre Layton (Daveed Diggs), was previously inhabited by an aging international architect, said production designer Stephen Geaghan. “His best days were the ’50s and ’60s, when he made his money.” Hence the homage to mid-20th-century design: Marcel Breuer Wassily chairs, sculptural circular fireplace and shagalicious carpet.</td>

      <td>The last-minute trade deal opens new doors for the U.K., EU and U.S.</td>
      <td>Brexit came down to the wire but it arrived Thursday, with a new trade deal between the United Kingdom and European Union. Arguments about whether this is a good or bad deal for either side matter less than the fact that British voters have finally received what they voted for in 2016.<br />Britain left the European Union on Jan. 31 and has been in a transitional period applying most EU economic regulations. The new deal governs trading rules when the transition ends on Dec. 31. The agreement provides for zero-tariff, zero-quota trade in goods and allows trade in some services to continue with minimal restriction. The U.K. regains the ability to set its own labor, environment and other regulations, although the EU could reapply tariffs if Brussels believes trade with the U.K. becomes “unfair.”<br />Trade won’t be as free as it was when the U.K. was in the EU, and more red tape is inevitable. The deal also doesn’t cover financial services. Because it leaves scope for greater divergence between the two sides, the deal is nearer to a so-called hard Brexit than many British and European politicians expected. But by the standards of other trade deals around the world, the new pact is relatively open.<br />The deal will prove its merit by what each side does with the new opportunities it presents. The U.K. has sacrificed seamless access to the European market as the price of regaining the regulatory freedom to unshackle its domestic economy and strike new trade deals with other nations.<br />Now London should follow through. Prime Minister Boris Johnson seems disinclined to push too hard for deregulation at home, but his Brexit deal will be a costly missed opportunity if he doesn’t. A trade deal with the U.S. would be the biggest prize, and one is possible if Britain is prepared to reform food-safety regulations and liberalize pharmaceutical procurement, among other things.</td>

It is a balanced deal and it is the right and responsible thing to do for both sides,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a press conference after the deal was announced. “The European Union and the United Kingdom will stand shoulder to shoulder to deliver on our common goals.”<br />Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the accord ends the uncertainty that has bedeviled U.K. politics for years and puts its economy on a better footing to recover from the pandemic. “This deal above all means certainty,” he said.<br />Germany and France welcomed the deal, a sign that the EU’s two largest economies are likely to support it when leaders formally sign off on the agreement next week.</td>

      <td>More than a season of good cheer, the holiday asks believers to think about reality itself in new ways.</td>
      <td>Christmas came early to my town this year. Even before the children made their socially distanced way from house to house for trick-or-treating, the storefronts and houses of Berwyn, Pa., were decorated in long coils of Christmas lights. On our local online discussion board, one woman said that she wished everyone could have just waited until after Thanksgiving and the beginning of Advent. Seasonal decorations, after all, are properly reserved for the season.<br />You can imagine the response she received. Incredulous to the point of anger, other neighbors announced that after a lousy year which sometimes felt like an unending darkness, it was a great relief to drive around and see the lights sparkling. At least one could enjoy the lights even if the businesses themselves were shuttered! They had a point: For many of us, Christmas isn’t about commemorating a specific event, the birth of Jesus, at a particular time. Rather, it is a whole season of sentiment. Avalanches of greeting cards, unexpected warm smiles from passersby, the ringing of bells, the singing of carols, a childlike awe at lights in the darkness—all serve to induce a sensation of good cheer.<br />What should Christians make of such simple pleasures and delights? Are they innocent distractions, obstacles to faith—or perhaps something more profound than we give them credit for?<br />Frank Capra’s 1946 film “It’s a Wonderful Life” has become a Christmas classic in part because it so beautifully captures the sentimental spirit of Christmas. In nearly every scene, Capra plays on our sympathies, tugging the heartstrings at the puppy love between George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) and Mary Hatch (Donna Reed); at the villainy of Mr. Potter, the greedy banker (Lionel Barrymore); at the delicate affection of George’s daughter Zuzu for the flower she has won at school.<br />The most obviously sentimental appeal comes from Clarence the angel (Henry Travers). Near the end of the film, George, threatened with bankruptcy and jail because his alcoholic uncle has mislaid the firm’s cash, despairs of what he has made of his life and attempts suicide on Christmas Eve. He is rescued by the inept but loving Clarence, who has been sent to teach him the true value of his life.</td>

What began as a whimsical exercise on the model of Time’s Person of the Year has grown in stature as dictionary publishers and other groups have followed suit.<br />For a decade now, I have been overseeing the dialect society’s Word of the Year selection as chair of the its New Words Committee. For this year, more than 300 attendees took part in a virtual event last week featuring a lively debate over nominations in a variety of categories.<br />There was no shortage of innovative terms, including some previously featured in this column, like “doomscrolling” (obsessing over bad news online, chosen as Digital Word of the Year) and “the Before Times” (a term for the pre-pandemic era, deemed Most Useful). Other prime 2020 words included “oysgezoomt,” a Yiddishism meaning “fatigued by overexposure to Zoom,” and “Blursday,” to describe the experience of days seeming to blend into each other during lockdown.<br />But the overall winner of Word of the Year, after much deliberation, was a more obvious word with which we’ve become all too familiar: “Covid.” It’s hard even to think back to the beginning of 2020—aka the Before Times—when those five letters carried no meaning. The closest you might have gotten to it was “corvid,” known to bird lovers as a term covering crows, jays, magpies and ravens.</td>

      <td>Seeking an ocean passage to China, William Barents set the template for polar adventure and endurance.</td>
      <td>The cold, hoary legacy of polar exploration depends on outsize characters—and good books. Some chronicle legendary survivors. Ernest Shackleton found fame in 1917 by bringing his crew safely back from Antarctica, yielding one of the best adventure stories ever written: Alfred Lansing’s “Endurance.” Other explorers made their way into print by dying. John Franklin, who was lost in 1847 trying to find the Northwest Passage, inspired such titles as “The Man Who Ate His Boots.” The Norwegian Roald Amundsen both survived and disappeared. He forced the Northwest Passage in 1905 and then led the first expedition to the South Pole, recounting his adventures in several bestsellers. Amundsen later perished in an Arctic rescue mission. Conquest and tragedy fused to form the ideal polar hero.<br />The template for the romantic Arctic explorer was set 300 years earlier. As Andrea Pitzer writes in “Icebound,” William Barents of the Netherlands became the first European to journey into the icy void. “He was the patron saint of devoted error,” Ms. Pitzer asserts, attempting three times to find a northeast passage by sea over Russia to China in the late 16th century. Barents died in the effort while most of his crew survived. His crewmate Gerrit de Veer published a book telling the story. “Barents’s failures came from the immense adversity he faced,” Ms. Pitzer explains. “In time, that adversity itself would become the source of his fame.”<br />“Icebound” is a fascinating modern telling of Barents’s expeditions. The book faces limitations due to its very old source material: there is a dearth of known facts about Barents himself. Much of the extant record of his three voyages comes from de Veer’s contemporary account. Certain basic details have been lost, including the name of Barents’s ship and the man’s personality. As a result, “Icebound,” while fluid in its telling and thorough in its research, necessarily lacks the human element of the greatest adventure tales.<br />This is not to gainsay the book’s drama. Ms. Pitzer presents a compelling narrative situated in the context of Dutch imperial ambition. She writes vividly about the “unnerving isolation” of venturing north and east of Scandinavia into uncharted waters. “Going to sea can be challenging enough with a plotted course and an endpoint in mind,” she writes. “Sailing day after day without a map into unknown territory is a completely different experience. It’s impossible to know which kinds of shores, or what animals, wind, and weather may appear next. Any given tomorrow might have brought Barents or his men within sight of an open sea beckoning them to China.”<br />The open sea was a mirage—like so much else in the Arctic. A common theory since the time of the ancient Greeks posited that a warm polar ocean lay beyond the ice. It was said that crops could grow on land in its temperate climate, and that ships might sail freely over the north pole. Barents, who served as navigator, subscribed to this view. If he could prove it, then the Dutch, recently liberated from Spain, could achieve parity with other European powers by opening a faster trade route to the East.</td>

      <td>Frustrated by James Bond-style myths, John le Carré fashioned a literature of betrayal and the cost of secrets.</td>
      <td>The late John le Carré, born David John Moore Cornwell in 1931, liked to quote fellow English novelist Graham Greene to the effect that “childhood is the writer’s bank balance.” Thanks to an anxious upbringing, young David acquired enough authorial capital for the future le Carré to produce 26 books: tales of espionage and more that injected emotional complexity into “the secret world” and transformed spy fiction forever.<br />“The only relationship that I had as I grew up,” le Carré told a Beverly Hills audience in 1999, “was with my father . . . a mercurial, enormously attractive and totally amoral person who was, by profession, not to put too fine an edge on it, a confidence trickster and saw the inside of a number of prisons in his lifetime. The effect of that continues to haunt me.”<br />In his 2016 autobiographical collection “The Pigeon Tunnel,” le Carré recalled how “Ronnie the conman could spin you a story out of the air, sketch in a character who did not exist, and paint a golden opportunity when there wasn’t one.” When not separating gullible partners from their funds, his father could also be violent and was so to his first and second wives. “Ronnie beat me up, too,” le Carré wrote, “but only a few times and not with much conviction.” David’s abused mother (Ronnie’s first wife) left when he was 5, and the boy would spend his youth poring over business papers that his father kept boxed in the attic, seeking details of his dad’s larcenous schemes. “By the age of eight I was already a well-trained spy.”<br />The Oxford-educated David made espionage his career, working first for MI5, then MI6. He wrote his first two works of fiction—under a pseudonym, for security reasons—while still in his government’s employ. Starring in these books was an unprepossessing intelligence officer named George Smiley.<br />Le Carré wanted to up his literary game, partly, he claimed, in response to Ian Fleming’s James Bond fantasies of the 1950s and ’60s, which he dubbed “cultural pornography.” “It was a very rum thing,” he observed, “being in the secret world and watching the literary extension of it as a kind of saccharine vision of a life we didn’t live. Anybody involved in it I think would have been aware of the human cost, the incompetence, the constant cockups, the tragicomedy of it all. . . . Espionage . . . needed some kind of serious treatment, I thought.”</td>

      <td>Tiny towers, fake ruins and Greek temples for the garden: the joys of a very English architectural obsession.</td>
      <td>The subject of this discursive book is the architectural folly, which the British author Rory Fraser describes as “an elaborate building set in a beautiful landscape that serves no purpose other than to improve the view: architecture for the sake of architecture.” Follies originated as a feature of English and French 18th-century landscape gardening, and were typically Greek temples, turreted towers and picturesque ruins. The Great Pagoda in Kew Gardens is an example; so is the Temple of Love built for Marie-Antoinette in the garden of Versailles.<br />Mr. Fraser broadens the definition and includes other eccentric memorials and odd garden structures. He is drawn to their quirky architecture and equally to the stories behind their creation. Most writing about this subject has a condescending quality—what will they think of next? What distinguishes Mr. Fraser’s engaging book is that the author takes his unserious subject seriously, seeing follies as offering a portal into the past, “a diagonal glimpse of a soft underbelly that is rarely seen, revealing the dreams of those who built them when unconstrained by the contemporary equivalent of ‘building regs.’ ”<br />Rory Fraser is fortunate that in these trying times most readers will encounter his book online; it’s hard to know in which section of a bricks-and-mortar bookstore this slim volume would be shelved. “Follies” is a sort of travel book—it ranges over England with a side trip to Wales—but takes a narrower perspective than most books of this genre. It deals with history, from a 13th-century priory to a 20th-century obelisk, but its treatment of the past is idiosyncratic rather than scholarly. It is part memoir and part architectural diary, and illustrated not with plans and photographs but with the author’s charming watercolors, which give it an old-fashioned air that complements its subject.<br />Mr. Fraser is not an architect; he studied English at Oxford. This amateurism is all to the good because his book avoids the usual academic jargon and is a pleasure to read. Here he is describing Freston Tower in Suffolk: “Built at the height of Elizabethan England, the brickwork is beautifully mottled. Smoked browns and dusty reds form a narrow base, in turn fretted with diamonds in charcoal blue that rise up the side, culminating in four fantastic finials.” The tower stands beside the River Orwell and was built by a wealthy landowner to observe a ceremonial passage of the Virgin Queen’s barge. “What better way to attract her languid eye than to build a massive orange tower on the starboard side—complete with a portly merchant waving frantically from the top of it.”<br />Mr. Fraser’s occasionally ironic prose reminds me of Evelyn Waugh’s travel writing. Waugh comes to mind because one of the follies that Fraser visits is at the end of the garden of Castle Howard, the spectacular country house that was the setting for the 1981 televised version of “Brideshead Revisited.” Remember the scene where Sebastian Flyte and Charles Ryder are sampling wine in a fanciful garden pavilion? That domed room with its four Roman porticos—called the Temple of the Four Winds—was the work of the great architect John Vanbrugh, who also designed the main house. Vanbrugh was inspired by Palladio’s Villa Rotonda, but he transformed the Renaissance villa, shrank its dimensions and added Jacobean flourishes as well as a curious Mughal dome. “A shapeshifting folly—surely not?” the author asks, but he is reminded that Vanbrugh spent time in India as a young man, and that John Soane described him as “the Shakespeare of architects.” “Just as Shakespeare played around with a still molten language to revolutionise English theatre, so too did Vanbrugh with architectural elements—based on his own experiences—to create a new national Baroque that was distinct from its Catholic European counterparts,” Mr. Fraser trenchantly observes.</td>

      <td>While the historic agreement signed by the U.K. and European Union on Christmas Eve removes the risk of very bad economic outcomes, it leaves much up in the air</td>
      <td>For the Brexit process, the deal announced by the U.K. and the European Union on Christmas Eve marks a long-awaited end to the beginning.<br />For business and markets, it removes the worst of the risks associated with Britain’s decision to quit the trading bloc. The two sides no longer face the prospect of tariffs or quotas on each other’s goods from Jan. 1—an outcome that would have massively disrupted trade patterns that have built up over decades in products such as food, vehicles and airplanes.<br />That explains sterling’s roughly 1% rise against the euro since talk of a deal gained steam on Wednesday. A worst-case scenario that was dragging down the average view of Britain’s economic prospects has been removed.<br />This doesn’t mean the prospects are great. Even with a tariff-free trade deal, the U.K. government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, previously forecast that Britain’s output would be 4% lower than it might have been if the country had remained within the bloc, mainly because “nontariff barriers” such as divergent regulations and customs checks will reduce trade. Sterling is still close to historic lows against the euro.<br />Of course, signals from currency markets and the outputs of economic forecasting models both need to be taken with a fistful of salt. Optimists see plenty of opportunity for the U.K. now that it can sign trade deals with third parties. Where they agree with the pessimists is that the long-term nature of Britain’s relationship with its biggest trading partner has yet to be fully determined. The U.K. sent 43% of its exports to the EU last year, while 52% of U.K. imports came from the bloc.</td>

      <td>Finding the balance between the twin myths of Graham Greene’s inner demons and his questing spirit.</td>
      <td>In stark chronological terms, Graham Greene (1904-1991) was a member of that spangled generation of British writers born in the golden decade between 1900 and 1910, a logjam of talent that included such mighty timbers as George Orwell and Evelyn Waugh (both born in 1903), Christopher Isherwood (1904), Anthony Powell and Henry Green (both 1905) and W.H. Auden (1907). Generational solidarity went only so far among this gang of highly individual Edwardian contenders, and so the views of Greene held by his professional peers are always worth attending to.<br />Waugh, for example, admired Greene’s work, shared his religious convictions but distrusted his politics. Orwell filed a no-holds-barred review of “The Heart of the Matter” (1948) for the New Yorker in which he accused Greene of glamorizing sin and regarding hell as a “high-class nightclub” with entry reserved exclusively for Roman Catholics. But it was Powell, brought news of the 86-year-old Greene’s death (in the Swiss hospital where he was being treated for aplastic anaemia), who left the most searing judgment: a valediction so wounding that it was confided to Powell’s diary rather than the newspapers who had asked for tributes.<br />“From the word go I had found his books wholly unreadable,” Powell begins, “long before there could have been any question of jealousy.” Good at reportage, he conceded, a lively journalist and an astute businessman, but the novels are “vulgarised Conrad” further cheapened by religious propaganda, and as for the personality of the man who wrote them, “I think he was completely cynical, really only liking sex and money and his own particular form of publicity.” There is also talk of a “colossal row” dating from the post-World War II days, when for a brief period Greene, in his capacity as a director of the firm of Eyre & Spottiswoode, was Powell’s publisher.<br />The “row” is more extensively, yet still obliquely, covered in Powell’s memoirs. It involved Powell’s group biography “John Aubrey and His Friends” (1948). Owing to a combination of paper shortages and publisher inertia, the work had still not appeared in print two years after it was accepted. When Powell, not unreasonably, complained about this delay, Greene lost his temper and declared that “it’s a bloody boring book anyway.” The memorialist professed himself “ruffled.” In reality, as Richard Greene (no relation) reveals in this diligently researched biography, the two men did not speak for the next dozen years. Powell further remarks about the contretemps that Greene “would go white with rage on such occasions, admitting that he had to have rows from time to time for his health.”<br />Powell signs off with mention of Greene’s “delight in polemics, causing trouble.” It has to be said that few of these asperities survive into “The Unquiet Englishman: A Life of Graham Greene.” This, as its author acknowledges, is intended as a corrective to Norman Sherry’s mammoth three-volume endeavor “The Life of Graham Greene” (1989-2004) and Michael Shelden’s “Graham Greene: The Enemy Within” (1995), both of which went to town on their subject’s sexual peccadilloes and his supposed deviousness. Greene’s Greene, alternatively, is, if not exactly a benign, healing presence, then a force for good in the political and ethical debates of his day—a mythmaker, certainly, and a creature of the will but, for all his trafficking with the devil, indisputably on the angels’ side.</td>

      <td>Contemporary novelists readily take on the end of the world. The end of a life is a tougher subject.</td>
      <td>There is a hole in contemporary fiction that has been noticeable for some time but was especially conspicuous in this year. Novelists are obsessed with the apocalypse and have envisioned countless scenarios for the downfall of civilization. Equally, they are transfixed by grief and repeatedly are drawn to produce meditations on loss and recovery. But they do not like to write about the subtext of these preoccupations, the thing that they are hinting toward or circling around, cautiously evoking yet usually leaving off the page. They do not like to write about death.<br />How to write about something no one among the living has experienced? In his “Aspects of the Novel,” E.M. Forster observes: “There is scarcely anything that the novelist cannot borrow from ‘daily death’; scarcely anything he may not profitably invent. The doors of that darkness lie open to him and he can even follow his characters through it, provided he is shod with imagination.” The novelist’s inherent ignorance is in fact the source of unmatched artistic possibility, and when we think of the most enduring writers we can nearly always match them with an unforgettable death scene. The death may be noble, like Sydney Carton’s in “A Tale of Two Cities,” or wretched, like Madame Bovary’s; it may be romantic, like Dr. Zhivago’s, or hideously meaningless, like the suffering child’s in Camus’s “The Plague”; but it is always present.<br />Such scenes are the exception now, implied but rarely confronted, and in this reticence, I think, literature is running downstream from culture at large. Western society, having insulated itself from the reality of death more successfully than any collection of people in human history, is uncomfortable with reminders of its inevitability. Death has become as we imagine sex was to the Victorians: a taboo, unsuitable for mixed company—one of the last unmentionable subjects.<br />Much of our perceived immunity to death disappeared in 2020, and so far as that affected reading habits, it was perfectly reasonable to want books that provided the escapism that had become harder to find in real life. I felt that too. But amid the tensions and anxieties, the uninterrupted blare of ambulance sirens, the close calls and the tragedies, I also found myself searching for books that looked plainly at death, even as I rearranged my life to elude it.<br />Echoing Plato and Cicero, Montaigne famously declared: “To philosophize is to learn how to die.” “To begin depriving death of its greatest advantage over us,” he wrote, “let us adopt a way clean contrary to that common one; let us deprive death of its strangeness; let us frequent it, let us get used to it; let us have nothing more often in mind than death.” Literature can help us with this as well. In his novel “My Red Heaven,” which was published in January, before most people could have foreseen the shape the year would take, Lance Olsen puts the matter more imperatively: “Art doesn’t make life more bearable or longer or impervious to anguish. Its real goal is the opposite: to teach you that nobody can be saved in the end.”</td>

      <td>A look at well-intentioned but off-target books for little ones—and a few that hit the mark.</td>
      <td>Most of the year, this column is devoted to the best new books for young readers. Not so this week. As a last gasp of our annus horribilis, let’s talk about what makes for a bad book; specifically, what makes for a lousy board book for babies and toddlers. As for why publishers produced so many, I suppose the usual answer applies: It’s 2020. What do you expect?<br />To understand why some board books are great and some suboptimal, you have to consider who is meant to read them. Children ages 0-3 haven’t been here very long. They’re learning our language, but they may not speak it yet. In their first few months, they don’t even see colors; their world is black, white and gray. As children grow, they learn to discriminate between sounds and shapes and attach names to people, animals and objects. They start to learn spatial concepts (up/down, in/out) and mathematical ideas (one versus many). The concept of zero, which seems obvious to grown-ups, is not grasped by most children until after the age of 4.<br />In other words, babies and toddlers are not like us; they don’t know what we know. Good board books respect this innocence—young children’s newness to words and pictures—and meet them where they are. In 2020, I am happy to say, there were some great ones, brimming with humor and beauty and appropriate for their audience. Creative Editions published “Egg,” with simple, delightful rhymes by Amy Sky Koster and exquisite illustrations by Lisel Jane Ashlock. Candlewick Press brought out Kenneth Kraegel’s droll and surprising board book “This Is a Book of Shapes” and Steve Light’s deceptively sophisticated concept book “Up Cat Down Cat.” Minedition produced Giuliano Ferri’s “Masquerade Party,” a satisfying layering of ideas and language with sturdy fold-out panels. “Who is this plucky pirate?” we read. When the fellow’s hat is lifted away, the answer appears: “It’s a playful pig.”<br />There were board books that, while great in theory, slightly missed the mark. Xavier Deneux’s construction-site illustrations for “Build!” have graphic appeal, but the book’s removable, puzzle-like pieces are exasperatingly liable to disappear into the sofa cushions. Sam Boughton’s pictures for Templar’s “Hello, Elephant!” and “Hello, Bear!” are so splashy and distempered, and the typeface for his prose so scraggly, that it may be hard for small eyes to know where to look. The same is true of Isobel Lundie’s illustrations for “The Amicus Book of Earth,” from Amicus Ink, which feel flat and crowded on the small page.<br />Then we come to a category we might call “too much too soon.” These 2020 board books are not really for little ones, mostly because they presume a body of knowledge that babies and toddlers don’t have. Little, Brown’s “The Princess Bride: A Counting Story” by Lena Wolfe—based on the PG movie and illustrated by Bill Robinson—begins: “1 Story, 2 Lovers, 3 Outlaws.” Another entry from this category is Putnam’s four-volume “Big Ideas for Little Philosophers” series by Duane Armitage and Maureen McQuerry, with pictures by Robin Rosenthal. “A philosopher is a person who loves wisdom,” toddlers learn from “Truth With Socrates.” “Wisdom means knowing things that help you live better and be happy.” In “Equality With Simone de Beauvoir,” children get this message: “We don’t have to be the way everyone expects us to be. We just have to be ourselves.” (Hmm, the philosophical parent may think: not when it comes to table manners.)</td>

      <td>Covid has turned even cultural luminaries into homebodies. We asked 18 musicians, actors, artists, designers and authors to share their favorite quarantine discoveries.</td>
      <td>IT FEELS almost callous to call anything a silver lining in 2020, but during this tumultuous year, many people eagerly took shelter in culture, high and low. Film, TV, books and music gave us relief and a center of gravity. In the interest of tallying up the silver linings and seeking recommendations to help us weather the next few months, we asked 18 well-known cultural figures to share their favorite quarantine discoveries and comfort fare. Many were drawn to the familiar. Actor Jon Hamm, for example, spent part of his downtime consuming comedies from the 1970s and 1980s that he remembered from his youth. “I found myself, like a lot of people, going back to what feels comfortable and knowable, because so much of our existence in the last eight months has been uncomfortable and unknowable,” he said.<br />Others took this strangely antisocial period to get acquainted with a classic work of art they’d always pledged to tackle. This was the year to gorge on Wong Kar-wai films or sink into Tolstoy. And then there was Slime. The gooey substance adored by children and shunned by parents might not be everyone’s idea of a cultural touchstone, but musician Norah Jones, we learned, is a recent convert and vouches for its therapeutic properties. For his part, Swizz Beatz thrilled at excavating Marvin Gaye. “I was in that zone, just digging up everything I could find from him,” he told us. Candice Bergen found herself happily burrowing into the “Wolf Hall” trilogy and keeping company with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly in “To Catch a Thief.” As she admitted, “I’m behind on stuff. I’ve just gone into sludge mode.”<br />Quarantine Discovery ’70s and ’80s comedy classics that he grew up with, such as ‘Beverly Hills Cop,’ ‘48 Hrs.’ and ‘Fun with Dick and Jane.’ “A lot of iconic comedies, the tone of which and pace of which they don’t really make anymore,” said Mr. Hamm. Also on the list: the 1985 Chevy Chase film “Fletch.” (It was recently announced that Mr. Hamm will star in a reboot.)<br />Up Next Finishing current TV series like “Lovecraft Country” and “The Queen’s Gambit.”<br />Quarantine Discovery Timbaland has been consumed by Prince’s discography, especially his self-titled 1979 album. “I started to dive into the sonics, just trying to understand the difference between warm tape and digital because I feel like Prince had cracked the code when that album came out.” Mr. Beatz has been listening to a lot of Marvin Gaye. “It’s just a classic. Even the Marvin Gaye albums that weren’t famous, you know, ‘Here, My Dear,’ and so many of them that were never mainstream records but then you go back and find these discoveries.”</td>

      <td>As a relatively clean fossil fuel, natural gas will play a useful role for years to come. It is less certain that it will be a profitable one.<br />Exuberant investment in new gas reserves and liquefaction facilities in recent years helped globalize the market but also created a glut. Growing Asian demand has pushed prices up dramatically this month, raising hopes of better times. But any sustained recovery in prices and profits will require fossil-fuel producers to resist the temptation to overinvest once again in their favorite green-transition fuel.<br />Future gas demand will balance two major trends: growing prosperity in Asia driving an increase in consumption; and declining sales in Europe and North America. Future profitability depends on how well supply and demand match up.<br />The world’s biggest economies have promised radical change. The European Union, Japan, South Korea and the U.K. have all committed to cut their net emissions to zero by 2050, while China is aiming for 2060. The U.S. under the Biden administration may join them.<br />Natural gas will likely play two key roles in that green transition: replacing coal-fired power plants until sufficient renewables production can be built; and fueling backup peaker plants to bridge the gaps in intermittent wind and solar generation.</td>

Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, who oversees Covid-19 testing, said at a media briefing last week. “You can expect more at-home and screening testing, like before you go to work, before you travel.”<br />Some large employers, including companies such as  Netflix Inc.,  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  recently started expanding testing for workers, looking to screen people without symptoms. Last week, Google started offering weekly testing for its 90,000 U.S. employees, and airlines and tourist organizations are hoping that testing will get people back in the air.<br />The U.S. will likely be able to perform more than 70 million Covid-19 tests a week by the end of January, according to recent estimates from the Rockefeller Foundation. By April, that is expected to grow to 200 million weekly tests. The growth will be driven by tests done outside laboratories, including in schools and doctors’ offices, and those processed at home. Increasing the number of patient samples analyzed in a single test, a technique known as pooling, will also likely contribute, the foundation said.</td>

      <td>Michael Jackson’s onetime Neverland ranch has sold for $22 million to billionaire Ron Burkle, a onetime associate of the late pop star and co-founder of the investment firm Yucaipa Companies, according to public records and three people familiar with the deal.<br />The property, located about 40 miles from Santa Barbara, had been on and off the market for years, first listing for $100 million in 2015 and undergoing several price cuts. It was listed for $31 million last year, The Wall Street Journal reported.<br />Mr. Jackson’s estate co-owned the ranch with a fund managed by  Colony Capital ,  a real-estate investment trust. Amid financial struggles, Mr. Jackson had defaulted on a loan backed by the ranch and Colony bought the note in 2008, putting the property’s title into a joint venture it formed with the pop star. Mr. Jackson originally paid about $19.5 million for the ranch in 1987.<br />Mr. Jackson made Neverland famous by installing quirky features like a railroad and an amusement park, which included a Ferris wheel and a merry-go-round. He also kept orangutans and an elephant there. A whimsical floral clock in the front of the property spelled out “Neverland.” The ranch was named for the fantasy world in J.M. Barrie’s “Peter Pan.”<br />The Los Olivos property spans about 2,700 acres and includes about 22 structures, including a 12,000-square-foot Normandy-style mansion. There are also several guesthouses, a swimming pool with a cabana, a basketball court, a tennis court and a 50-seat movie theater, The Wall Street Journal reported when the property came on the market.</td>

      <td>During a tumultuous year, sneaker companies continued to deliver an incredible number of sneaker designs, some with truly perplexing features--evoking cloven hoofs, teeter-totters and even melting ice-cream cones</td>
      <td>AROUND THIS TIME last year, I cataloged the strangest clothing items I’d come across in 2019: seven superlatively odd garments that stood out from the many, many pieces of fashion I’d encountered over the previous 365 days. (I’m still wondering who would buy Moschino’s bobble-head baseball caps.)<br />2020 has been another beast altogether. For the past nine months or so, I’ve been working from my kitchen table. Meanwhile, many of the trappings of the fashion industry are gone. Runway shows are rare now; on hold are the sort of in-person meetings I’d previously attended to review new collections; and red-carpet events—with their outlandish celebrity outfits—have largely disappeared. In short, I’ve had far fewer opportunities to inspect new clothes, bizarre or otherwise.<br />One facet of the industry felt like business as usual, however: the ceaseless churn of sneaker releases. For years, shoe brands have been hyping their shoes on Instagram and selling them through webshops or phone apps—a digital rollout system that seemed already designed for a socially distanced America. And so all year long, as we all shopped from home, brands like Prada,  Nike  and Vans rolled out an incredible number of new sneakers.<br />Many of these sneakers are immensely odd, marked by design elements like fake fur, colors more lurid than a bowl of Lucky Charms and convoluted soles that would look at home in Robo-Cop’s wardrobe. Many of these garish shoes have nevertheless become collectible, fetching thousands of dollars (or at least ten times their sticker price) on the resale market.<br />2020’s crop of sneakers further supported my theory that sneaker designs are getting stranger and stranger as a way to stand out on little phone screens. The sneakers that I remember from this year are those that made me stop my mindless scrolling and think, ‘What is going on?’ Here are seven contenders for weirdest of them all.</td>

He is the author of 12 Japanese-language books and divides his time between running a business that renovates temples and shrines and offering policy advice at meetings in which he reels off statistics.<br />Mr. Atkinson has lived in Japan since 1990, a few years after he graduated from Oxford University, and speaks Japanese fluently. At Goldman in the 1990s, he presciently warned that Japanese banks’ weaknesses were endangering the economy. More recently he has been known as a strong advocate for boosting tourism.<br />His latest message is that fixing Japan’s economic stagnation begins with raising the productivity of its smaller companies. This month, the government said it planned to offer up to about $1 million to small or midsize companies that merge or expand into new business areas—a direct result of Mr. Atkinson’s advocacy.</td>

The political and media condemnation was swift and scathing. Douglas shut its stores the next day and issued an apology.<br />“Our decision to keep some stores with drugstore products open was incomprehensible to many people,” Ms. Müller wrote on her  Twitter  feed. “All of our German stores will remain closed from today until further notice. We apologize to those who feel offended by our actions.”<br />The short-lived experiment was just one of the most high-profile examples of how businesses, from large corporations to mom-and-pop diners and even brothels, have been scanning lockdown orders for loopholes to maintain some activity.</td>

Intercontinental Exchange  carbon futures traded Thursday for €32.03 a ton, equivalent to $39.14, just below their record highs hit earlier this month.<br />Driving the latest rally is the recent decision by the European Union to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 55% of 1990 levels by 2030. Traders are also expecting regulations on the burning of fossil fuels will be tightened to meet the new target, including reducing the number of carbon credits available.<br />“It’s the pricing in of increased future ambition,” said Ariel Perez, senior carbon trader at commodities trading company Hartree Partners. “All that explicitly reduces supply and lower supply should lead to higher prices.”<br />Morgan Stanley  upped its 2025 forecast for European carbon-credit prices in September to €76 from €44, meaning the bank expects current prices to more than double by the middle of the decade. The EU’s climate agenda has significant implications for the price of carbon credits, the bank said.</td>

      <td>New program encourages shoppers to insist on receipts, which become lottery tickets</td>
      <td><br />ROME—Italy is rolling the dice on a new attempt to stamp out tax evasion: a lottery in which only people who ask for receipts can take part.<br />Beginning Jan. 1, shoppers will receive a virtual ticket for each euro they spend in any store, so long as they ask for a receipt. Seven people will win 5,000 euros, equivalent to about $6,100, each week, with a top prize of €5 million at the end of next year.<br />The idea is to use the allure of cash prizes to ensure transactions are recorded and a levy is paid on them in a bid to reduce the tax dodging that has weighed on Italy’s economy for decades. The lottery complements another program in which shoppers can get cash back of up to 10% of whatever they spend until the end of the year, up to a total of €150, if they use their card.<br />Italy isn’t the first country to try the approach. Governments in several countries have turned receipts into lottery tickets to persuade shoppers to demand that their purchases go on the books, including China, some states in Brazil, the Czech Republic and Portugal. Some have found it an effective way to increase tax revenue without increasing rates.</td>

The department could also be drawn into politically sensitive actions by the president, such as grants of clemency to family members and allies, though Mr. Trump has largely ignored the department on its pardon recommendations and could leave it as a bystander to such moves.<br />The Justice Department is also still overseeing a number of closely watched investigations that have drawn the personal attention of the president—including a criminal tax probe into President-elect Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden and a continuing review by special counsel John Durham into actions taken by federal investigators during the 2016 election campaign.<br />The remaining few weeks of Mr. Trump’s term are likely to be dominated by these and other matters, potentially putting Mr. Rosen at the center of numerous brewing political battles with the White House. Though Mr. Barr was long a stalwart defender of Mr. Trump’s agenda and priorities as head of the Justice Department, he rebuffed the president’s calls to appoint a special counsel to investigate election fraud and the allegations against the younger Mr. Biden, and attempted to insulate criminal probes under way from political pressure.<br />The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.</td>

Back in April, the Chamber of Commerce warned its membership in April that Covid liability suits are “perhaps the largest area of concern for the overall business community.”<br />“In the beginning, we were concerned for our clients that this was going to spur a lot of personal-injury lawsuits,” said William Hubbard, a partner in the Cleveland law firm Thompson Hine which represents businesses. “The facts might just not be there for the cases.”</td>

PARRY: There is a massive investment opportunity set in the lower midmarket and the potential to create value and capture multiple expansion in these companies, if the general partner can professionalize and grow the business. But there are also a lot of bad companies and general partners operating in the lower midmarket, and we expect to see a shake out on the other side of the pandemic.<br />We’re long-term investors in this part of the market and understand it well. A lot of managers treat the lower midmarket as a sort of training ground. They raise a small fund, build a track record and move upmarket as fast as they can so that they can generate more fees with larger assets under management and the potential for more carry dollars.</td>

This is a longstanding issue in China’s e-commerce industry, where Alibaba reigns supreme.  JD.com ,  Alibaba’s competitor, has complained about it for years and filed lawsuits against the market leader. Abuse of digital-platform power is also a theme of antitrust suits in the U.S. and Europe against the likes of  Amazon  and Google.<br />It isn’t the first time the government has tried to step in. The antitrust regulator summoned 20 e-commerce platforms in November last year to urge them to stop monopolistic practices. But recent events have reinforced the impression that Beijing means business.<br />The government announced draft antitrust rules against digital platforms last month, after Ant Group’s $34 billion initial public offering was abruptly stopped by the regulators. The move seemed to be endorsed by the very top of China’s leadership structure. President Xi pledged to step up antimonopoly efforts to “prevent the disorderly expansion of capital” in a meeting earlier this month. Since then, the regulators have fined Alibaba and Tencent for acquisitions that were completed years earlier. Just this week, the government warned the internet giants about predatory pricing in what is known as community-group buying, a popular way to sell groceries online.</td>

      <td>U.S. stock futures edged higher Thursday, suggesting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average may end the holiday-shortened week on a flat note.<br />Futures tied to the Dow ticked up 0.2%. The blue-chips index slipped almost 0.2% this week through the Wednesday close. Futures linked to the S&P 500 gained 0.2%, while those on the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 index edged up 0.1%.<br />Markets will close early Christmas Eve, with the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq scheduled to end trading at 1 p.m. ET. U.S. and European markets will be closed Friday for Christmas celebrations.<br />Investors have been focused on a swath of issues this week, including the prospects for additional fiscal support for the economy and signs of the rebound faltering. Elevated coronavirus infection levels and a new variant of Covid-19 that emerged in the U.K. have prompted concerns that there may be additional lockdown measures in the winter months, weighing on market sentiment.<br />“The market is so on edge at the moment. People are worried about more lockdowns, more travel restrictions,” said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for State Street Global Advisors in Europe. “This will continue to bounce the market around.”</td>

      <td>Shares in  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  tumbled Thursday, extending a recent pullback, as China stepped up pressure on the e-commerce giant and its billionaire co-founder Jack Ma.<br />Alibaba’s Hong Kong stock dropped 8.1% to 228.20 Hong Kong dollars, its lowest point since July, in a shortened pre-Christmas trading session. The decline means Alibaba has now fallen more than 25% since a late October peak, when it was riding high ahead of a planned blockbuster listing of its financial-technology affiliate, Ant Group.<br />On Thursday, Chinese regulators said they were taking actions against Alibaba and Ant Group, weeks after China stopped an expected $34 billion listing by Ant in Hong Kong and Shanghai.<br />The State Administration for Market Regulation said it was investigating complaints of potentially monopolistic behavior—like making merchants sell exclusively on Alibaba platforms—while China’s central bank said it and other regulators had summoned Ant officials for a meeting.<br />In recent weeks, Chinese officials and regulators have also issued draft antitrust guidelines for internet platforms; cautioned that some companies could become “too big to fail”; and warned them not to engage in practices such as predatory pricing, abusing consumer data, or selling fraudulent products.</td>

As kidnapping carries a maximum of seven years in jail, and Mr. Sheikh had already been locked up for 18 years at that point, he was eligible for release.<br />Three accomplices who were sentenced to life in prison at the same 2002 trial had their convictions completely overturned in the April ruling.<br />However, Mr. Sheikh and the three others remained in prison after Pakistani authorities used emergency detention powers.</td>

      <td>Stone and Manafort played instrumental roles in president’s political rise; Charles Kushner is also among those pardoned</td>
      <td>President Trump issued 26 more pardons on Wednesday, granting clemency to individuals including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, longtime adviser Roger Stone and Charles Kushner, his son-in-law’s father.<br />Mr. Trump, who used the clemency power only sparingly early in his term, appears to be freely exercising it in his final weeks in office to grant reprieves to allies and associates in his political orbit. In addition to the acts of clemency announced this week, last month he pardoned his former national-security adviser Mike Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<br />Messrs. Stone and Manafort played instrumental roles in the president’s political rise, with Mr. Manafort serving as his campaign chairman in 2016 and Mr. Stone acting as a longtime political confidant. Both men were charged as part of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The elder Mr. Kushner served more than two years in prison.<br />An analysis by Harvard Law professor and former Justice Department official Jack Goldsmith found that 60 of the 65 pardons Mr. Trump granted before Wednesday went to individuals with personal or political connections to the president. Mr. Trump has bypassed the normal Justice Department process for reviewing pardons, frequently hearing appeals for clemency directly from celebrities or other friends, business associates or political allies.<br />Mr. Trump has also granted pardons to former law-enforcement officials accused of wrongdoing, as well as numerous political figures accused of crime, including campaign-finance violations. On Tuesday, he pardoned 15 others, among them three former Republican congressmen and several former military contractors convicted of wartime killing of Iraqi civilians.</td>

Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, compete with domestic rivals  JD.com Inc.  and  Pinduoduo Inc.<br />Alibaba didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

      <td>Personal gift-giving, as opposed to communal merry-making, is a recent development, but the logic of charity at Christmas is perennial.</td>
      <td>If, on Christmas morning, you discover that Santa surprised you with a copy of “The Oxford Handbook of Christmas,” what might you expect? Something like “The Boy Scout Handbook,” a compendium of useful information about preserving eggnog or tying bows rather than knots? Or perhaps a religious handbook for the season that includes daily prayers and spiritual exercises?<br />Fortunately, since such books would, by Christmas Day, be pointless for the next 11 months, this vast collection, edited by Timothy Larsen—an expert in Victorian religious life—offers stimulating essays on what might be called Christmasness; thus it will be ever timely. Roughly four-dozen writers (mostly scholars and theologians) take up the history, theology, worship, global traditions and artistic creations surrounding Christmas.<br />Much of what is on offer conjures Thomas Cranmer’s encouragement in the Book of Common Prayer to “read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest.” Consider one simple element in the nativity scene from the Gospel of Luke (aka Linus’s big speech in “A Charlie Brown Christmas”): the swaddling clothes. Here they are unwrapped to reveal layers of meaning. Some are literal: Greeks, Romans and Jews, we learn, swaddled their young—wrapped their babies tightly in strips of cloth—but not the Spartans. Other meanings are scriptural: In Job, God enwraps the sea, “thick darkness its swaddling band.” Luke’s phrase can also be seen as a comment on pagan myth: Rhea swaddles a stone to trick the infanticidal Kronos into swallowing it rather than their child Zeus. Then there are the meanings that refer to salvation: Jesus’ swaddling clothes prefigure his freeing us from death’s winding sheets.<br />Luke may be specific about the infant Christ’s wrappings, but, as the opening to the handbook’s New Testament section notes: “Scripture supplies no stable, donkey, three kings, or numerous other props of seasonal children’s pageants.” The Gospel of Matthew reveals the place of Jesus’ birth and Luke allows us to calculate the year, but the exact date is unknowable. By about A.D. 200, there were at least four estimates, ranging from January to May—but nothing in December. How did Christmas land on Dec. 25? The theologian Paul F. Bradshaw is as artfully forensic as Hercule Poirot, eliminating the usual suspects, such as the dates inherited from pagan holidays. “The weakness” of one theory, he dryly remarks, was that its author “was unable to produce any firm evidence in support of it.” He leans toward the scholars who explain Dec. 25 by showing long-ago attempts to date Christ’s conception to late March.<br />Dorothy Sayers once said that Christmas had become “barnacled about with sentimental accretions.” She worried that banalities would dull the shock of the Incarnation. For the scholars in “The Oxford Handbook of Christmas,” all the accreted layers are interesting. Take gifts, for instance. The first Christmas present was, of course, Jesus himself: “For God so loved the world, that he gave His only begotten Son.” But personal gift-giving (as opposed to communal merry-making) is a recent development, coinciding with industrialization (more stuff to buy) but not limited to it: The 5-year-old Laura Ingalls received both store-bought peppermint candy and homemade red mittens. Louisa May Alcott’s “Little Women” begins during the Civil War with unhappy teens: “Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents!” But then they bring their Christmas dinner to a poor German immigrant family, an act of kindness that inspires the rich man next door to send Christmas treats to them in turn. Charitable traditions at Christmas now encompass people of all faiths and none.</td>

Everywhere there was stability, in government and in society, for the centurions saw that it was so.<br />But everywhere there was something else, too. There was oppression—for those who were not the friends of Tiberius Caesar. There was the tax gatherer to take the grain from the fields and the flax from the spindle to feed the legions or to fill the hungry treasury from which divine Caesar gave largess to the people. There was the impressor to find recruits for the circuses. There were executioners to quiet those whom the Emperor proscribed. What was a man for but to serve Caesar?<br />There was the persecution of men who dared think differently, who heard strange voices or read strange manuscripts. There was enslavement of men whose tribes came not from Rome, disdain for those who did not have the familiar visage. And most of all, there was everywhere a contempt for human life. What, to the strong, was one man more or less in a crowded world?<br />Then, of a sudden, there was a light in the world, and a man from Galilee saying, Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s.</td>

      <td>His vetoes could cost Republicans the two Jan. 5 Georgia runoffs.</td>
      <td>President Trump is leaving office as he entered, with a whirlwind of action that gets more attention than it accomplishes. He may also take down his party’s chances of winning the Senate runoffs on Jan. 5. Does he care?<br />On Wednesday Mr. Trump vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that passed the House and Senate with overwhelming votes. He said the bill doesn’t include the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that provides liability protection for online platforms.<br />“Section 230 facilitates the spread of foreign disinformation online, which is a serious threat to our national security and election integrity. It must be repealed,” Mr. Trump said in a veto statement. The bigger threat to security is the recent Russian hack of the U.S. government, not social media companies.<br />Mr. Trump’s real objection is that  Twitter  and other tech giants are progressive outfits that block or restrict conservative content. On that he is often right, and Section 230 shouldn’t be immune from scrutiny. But repealing it wholesale, without debate, in a year-end defense bill is self-destructive. The only sure beneficiary would be the plaintiffs bar. Twitter and other tech platforms might become more censorious, not less, and conservatives aren’t likely to be favored in that scrum.<br />The NDAA isn’t perfect, but it extends hazard pay for U.S. forces that is set to expire at the end of the year. Mr. Trump’s statement called the bill a “gift” to China and Russia. But we doubt China will see it that way, since it establishes a Pacific Deterrence Initiative that authorizes $2.2 billion for, among other things, putting more military assets in China’s backyard and conducting exercises with allies. The bill also includes an overhaul of the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent, as well as cybersecurity provisions to protect command and control of U.S. nuclear systems.</td>

      <td>A top journal retracts a study following a political outcry.</td>
      <td>In 2020 scientific publications have leapt into the political fray. Scientific American gave its first ever Presidential endorsement to Joe Biden, declaring that Donald Trump “rejects evidence and science.” The New England Journal of Medicine said in a pre-election editorial that “our current leaders have undercut trust in science.”<br />But if populist politicians undercut trust in science, sometimes they are aided by science’s own institutions. Consider the controversy over a now-retracted paper in the prestigious science journal Nature Communications, which shows how political fashions can dictate what research outcomes are acceptable.<br />In November three NYU Abu Dhabi researchers came under fire for an article questioning the popular academic view that young women scientists are better off with female mentors. Their “science of science” study analyzed the impact of millions of scientific papers with junior and senior authors and drew conclusions about the effect of mentorship on careers.<br />“While current diversity policies encourage same-gender mentorships to retain women in academia,” the paper says in the abstract, “our findings raise the possibility that opposite-gender mentorship may actually increase the impact of women who pursue a scientific career.”<br />The authors—two of whom are women—pointed to possible explanations for their findings, including that “historically, male scientists had enjoyed more privileges and access to resources than their female counterparts.”</td>

      <td>Congress approves a deal to draw the country from its terror-supporting past.</td>
      <td>Congress approved the Sudan Claims Resolution Act this week, and our only complaint is that it took so long. The Trump Administration produced a transformative deal with Khartoum, but extended haggling on Capitol Hill needlessly endangered the fragile Sudanese government.<br />Sudan’s long-time dictator fell last year, and the transitional government is acting boldly to move on. A quarter century after the country hosted Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, the State Department negotiated an accord to restore the country’s sovereign immunity and lift its state sponsor of terrorism designation. In exchange, the Sudanese government agreed to normalize ties with Israel and pay $335 million to victims of the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings.<br />America’s foes should take note. Sudan was antagonistic for decades and responsible for American deaths. But it agreed to change and negotiated in good faith. It is behaving like a normal country, and its economy will benefit accordingly. Access to international finance, and to multilateral institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, will bring the previously isolated nation new avenues for commerce.<br />The opportunity to turn a terror-sponsoring state into a productive partner doesn’t come often, and the Trump Administration deserves credit for seizing it. So does most of Congress, where the deal received bipartisan support. But Senators Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Robert Menendez (D., N.J.) delayed passage for months, claiming the deal was bad for 9/11 victims’ families. One of the offers they called a compromise included an unrelated gift-basket for trial lawyers.<br />The bill that finally passed restores Sudan’s sovereign immunity generally but allows 9/11 victims’ families to pursue litigation in federal court. The cases could put Sudan on the hook for billions, but they’re unlikely to succeed. The law also includes $700 million in aid to the country and more than $200 million in loans.</td>

      <td>In the 1840s, Dickens didn’tsee how businessmen like his hero were already lifting mankind from poverty.</td>
      <td>No Christmas story except the biblical account of Jesus’ birth has been more often retold or more cherished than Charles Dickens’s “A Christmas Carol,” published in 1843. The reclamation of Ebenezer Scrooge has brought joy and hope to hundreds of millions of people across three centuries. “Scrooge” has become an eponym for stingy or miserly. We write in defense of this Ebenezer Scrooge, not the redeemed one.<br />Scrooge is a distilled caricature of a businessman in the Victorian era: a rich, obsessive wealth hoarder. Working in “his moldy old office,” living in “his dusty chambers” in a building so old and dreary that “nobody lived in it but Scrooge,” he was “a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone.” He strove from dawn till dusk to “understand his own business,” and “with his banker’s-book” he trudged home in the dark “to take his gruel” alone by a dying fire.<br />We meet Scrooge on Christmas Eve, when he is visited in his cold, dingy “counting-house” by his nephew, who urges him to stop working: “You’re rich enough.” The young man begs his uncle to join him in making merry on Christmas Day. Concerned about finding himself “a year older, but not an hour richer,” Scrooge answers that he will keep Christmas in his own way, by working.<br />It should be understood there is nothing unethical about Ebenezer Scrooge. In his view business “is the even-handed dealing of the world,” and “there is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty.” His great failing, in the words of his former fiancée, whom he gave up to marry his business, was that he had become a prisoner of “the master-passion, Gain.”<br />Scrooge’s reclamation begins on Christmas Eve when the ghost of his dead partner, Jacob Marley, visits to tell of his “life’s opportunity misused.” When Scrooge recalls his partner was “always a good man of business,” Marley’s ghost cries out “Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business: charity, mercy, forbearance and benevolence were all my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business.”</td>

      <td>Parties often conduct autopsies after losing elections. Since Democrats and Republicans alike gained and lost so much this difficult and bizarre year, both need sober after-action reviews.<br />Democrats won the White House but not the Senate. They also suffered surprising and significant losses in the House. Republicans have the upper hand in keeping the Senate, gained impressively in the House, kept their redistricting edge by turning back a well-funded Democratic effort to flip state legislatures. But they forfeited the presidency.<br />So what lessons can each party take from 2020?<br />One is that money can’t buy victory. Democrats outspent Republicans in every seriously contested Senate race yet flipped only Arizona and Colorado. Democrats showered $132.7 million on South Carolina’s Jaime Harrison against Sen. Lindsey Graham, who raised $109.3 million. Mr. Graham won by 10 points. Kentucky’s Amy McGrath, a Marine veteran, received $96.3 million for her bid against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose bankroll was $69.9 million. He won by 19.6 points.<br />Money also can’t buy a compelling message. In many races, Democrats had little more to say than that their Republicans opponents didn’t care about people with pre-existing conditions and were lackeys for President Trump.</td>

      <td>Surfing, skateboarding and sport climbing are now official Olympic sports. They’ll debut next year at the delayed Summer Games in Tokyo and in 2024 in Paris. The International Olympic Committee announced the decision Dec. 7.<br />The other sport to be introduced in France will be breakdancing, which started in the 1970s with African-American and Hispanic street youth dancing, spinning and twirling to hip-hop and rap music. The IOC has been pushing to include urban events like breakdancing to entice younger viewers. But is breakdancing really a sport?<br />The committee has changed its mind on sports in the past. In February 2013 the IOC announced it would remove Greco-Roman wrestling, which dates back to the original Olympics in ancient Athens, from competition in 2020. A massive public outcry ensued, and the decision was reversed that September.<br />Meanwhile, some fascinating and unusual examples of Olympic events have been held and discontinued. Tug of war was an Olympic medal sport starting with the second modern Olympics, in 1900, but was eliminated after 1920. Why not bring it back? Working together as a team to build up strength, endurance and precision perfectly fits with the Olympic spirit.<br />Some events gave out medals that have still never been established as official or unofficial by the IOC. Professional and volunteer firefighters competed in 1900. Angling was contested, with 600 fishermen (mostly from France) participating in six competitions.</td>

      <td>A keyboard masterpiece depends on the complex relationship between sound waves and musical notes.</td>
      <td>Mathematician Eugenia Cheng explores the uses of math beyond the classroom. Read more columns here.<br />Along with my usual chocolate Advent calendar, this year I decided to make myself a kind of musical Advent calendar by playing through a book of J.S. Bach’s “The Well-Tempered Keyboard,” a monumental collection of 24 preludes and fugues. Playing one a day made a perfect fit with my chocolates and the run-up to Christmas Eve.<br />Bach didn’t choose the number 24 arbitrarily. In Western music there are 12 notes in an octave, and for each note there is a major and a minor key, making 24 in total. To understand why there are 12 notes in an octave, rather than 10 or 14, we have to look at the math of sound waves.<br />The pitch of a note is determined by the frequency of its sound wave—that is, how many identical segments of the wave, or oscillations, pass a fixed point in a given period of time. The higher the frequency of a sound wave, the higher the pitch it produces. Harmony in music involves combining sound waves of different frequencies, making use of the fact that some waves reinforce one another while others interfere.<br />For any musical note, the note that goes with it most harmoniously is the same note one octave higher. That’s because the higher note has exactly twice the frequency, leading the two sound waves to oscillate together neatly. The next most harmonious note will be the one with three times the frequency, which in musical terms is a perfect fifth higher—for instance, the jump from C to G, which you can hear at the beginning of “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.”</td>

Absent a deal, tariffs would be applied Jan. 1 for the first time in nearly 50 years on some trade between the U.K. and the EU, causing an unwelcome economic disruption as countries are struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.<br />More directly impacted by the trade news, yields on European government bonds also climbed, with the 10-year German bond yield rising to minus 0.541% from minus 0.589% and the 10-year U.K. yield jumping to 0.285% from 0.186%.

But Tomorrow?” (Dec. 17): Forbidding natural-gas connections in new buildings ensures that more, not less, natural gas will be consumed to meet the new demand for electricity. Similarly, government mandates for electric vehicles, space heating and cooking will increase the total amount of natural gas burned.<br />Natural gas consumed as a fuel to heat or cook is more than 90% efficient, while electricity produced from natural gas is at best 60% efficient. This means that boiling a pot of water on an electric stove uses 150% as much natural gas as a gas stove. This is before any consideration is given to the inefficiencies of induction heating or losses in transmission.<br />On the other hand, if all U.S. homes were required to burn natural gas for space heating and cooking, the total amount of natural gas consumed nationwide would probably decline, with the added benefit of increasing the proportion of U.S. energy sourced from renewables.

The range of targets—from the departments of Commerce, State and Homeland Security to the National Institutes of Health—could provide Russian leaders with indispensable intelligence and secrets that can be used at a later stage.<br />Ultimately, the hack signals to the West that years of international sanctions haven’t hampered Russia’s global ambitions or deterred its security apparatus from conducting broad-based operations with impunity, analysts say.<br />“It’s always good to sneak into these systems and collect some intelligence that you can use in the future.
