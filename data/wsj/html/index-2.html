      <td>The President wants the cartel to pump more oil, but the U.S. to pump less.</td>
      <td>As cognitive dissonance goes, this is a classic. President Biden’s explicit policy goal is to reduce U.S. oil and gas production, limiting the global supply of fossil fuels in the name of fighting climate change. Yet his Administration is now imploring the OPEC oil cartel to pump more oil so U.S. gasoline prices don’t rise more than they already have on Mr. Biden’s watch.<br />Oil prices climbed to a six-year high on Tuesday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia failed to agree on increasing production quotas. Last spring OPEC slashed production quotas after crude prices plunged to $20 per barrel amid economic lockdowns and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.<br />But energy demand has snapped back in much of the world as Covid-19 vaccines roll out, governments ease lockdowns, and freight shipments surge. U.S. petroleum consumption is now roughly where it was at this time in 2019. OPEC estimates that oil demand in industrialized countries will increase by 2.7 million barrels a day this year.<br />In early June OPEC modestly raised production quotas, but demand is still rebounding faster than supply. The upshot is that crude prices are averaging around $74 a barrel, up 45% or so this year. OPEC countries naturally want to take advantage of the pandemic recovery to boost production and generate more petrodollars to fund their governments.<br />But a squabble between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over quotas is blocking an agreement, sending U.S. gasoline prices to a near seven-year high. Enter the Biden Administration. A White House spokesperson on Monday said it is urging OPEC and its allies to quickly come up with a compromise “that will allow proposed production increases to move forward.”</td>

      <td>Pentagon procurements are often roiled by political interference, and the massive JEDI (Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure) cloud-computing contract is another case in point. The Biden Defense Department rightly decided Tuesday to scrap the contract and start afresh.<br />Two years ago the Pentagon was preparing to award the $10 billion JEDI contract to  Microsoft  or  Amazon ,  both cloud leaders. The Pentagon needs to upgrade its technology for managing data, which range from reconnaissance mission readings to information about its more than 2.8 million employees, which are siloed among thousands of networks and centers.<br />Enter JEDI, which aimed to give the Pentagon a centralized “secure cloud environment” and allow it to “rapidly access computing and storage capacity to address warfighting challenges at the speed of relevance.”<br />Amazon was considered the frontrunner, but Trump Defense Secretary Mark Esper delayed the decision after some in Congress and  Oracle  complained that a former Defense official who had worked at Amazon steered the procurement to the company. President Trump also called for an investigation of the contract, but a Pentagon probe concluded the conflict didn’t affect the JEDI decision.<br />But after Defense handed the contract to Microsoft, Amazon alleged in a lawsuit that the contract was tainted by Mr. Trump’s animus against then CEO Jeff Bezos. The Pentagon denied that Mr. Trump influenced the procurement, but the litigation threatened to delay the contract for years.</td>

      <td>American shareholders get an expensive lesson in Xi Jinping risk.</td>
      <td>American investors buy shares in Chinese companies because they want to take bigger risks in exchange for bigger potential returns, and it looks like their wish is Beijing’s command. Witness how Chinese regulators have tanked the stock in ride-hailing firm  Didi Global Inc.  barely a week after the company raised $4.4 billion in a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.<br />The trouble started within days of last Wednesday’s listing, when Chinese regulators ordered Didi—the Chinese version of Uber and  Lyft —to stop accepting new customers and, later that weekend, told app stores to remove the app for download. The moves threatened the growth potential investors found so exciting. Beijing’s Cyberspace Administration, which issued these diktats, cited concerns about the security of user data.<br />Now Didi has become embroiled in what may turn into a broader Beijing crackdown on Chinese companies issuing shares abroad. The State Council on Tuesday said it would tighten oversight of companies listing overseas, particularly with regard to their use and storage of customer data. Beijing, which runs an increasingly extensive surveillance state, isn’t worried about its citizens’ privacy. Rather, it probably wants to make sure foreigners can’t access the same data that it can.<br />Two other recent U.S. listings,  Full Truck Alliance Co.  and  Kanzhun Ltd. , also are in the crosshairs over ostensible data concerns after raising a combined $2.5 billion in their public offerings last month. Didi’s shares fell more than 20% Tuesday, closing well below its IPO price of $14.<br />Most of this counts as business as usual in China, as investors should have known. Didi’s prospectus disclosed that executives from Didi and at least 30 other internet companies in April were hauled in for a meeting with Beijing regulators, where they were told to conduct “self-inspections” for compliance with antitrust, tax and other laws. The company warned it could only assume its self-criticism, er, inspection had been sufficient.</td>

      <td>A new effort by the teachers union to advance radical politics.</td>
      <td>Fresh off its largely successful efforts to keep millions of American kids out of classrooms for a year, the National Education Association is striking another blow against the nation’s education.<br />Many readers may view the country’s largest teachers union as a highly politicized and partisan activist group. It’s hard to argue the point when consulting the lobbying and campaign finance data on the website of OpenSecrets.org. Of the millions of dollars categorized as “independent expenditures” by NEA or affiliates in 2020, every single nickel went to supporting activities described by OpenSecrets as either “Against Republicans” or “For Democrats.”<br />But the union is not just favoring Democrats—it’s pushing them leftward. At its recent convention, the NEA adopted a resolution containing a to-do list that could have been drafted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.). The first objective listed in the policy reads:<br />The document goes on to note that “we oppose attempts to ban critical race theory and/or The 1619 Project” and also pledges to join “with Black Lives Matter at School and the Zinn Education Project” to call for “a national day of action to teach lessons about structural racism and oppression.”<br />This column has noted the number of prominent historians flagging significant historical errors in the 1619 project. Christopher Rufo recently wrote in these pages making the case against critical race theory.</td>

      <td>The French President’s green virtue signaling could cost him his job.</td>
      <td>President Emmanuel Macron’s climate-change amendment to the French constitution effectively died this week. Its failure is the latest example in Western democracies of the disconnect between elites obsessed with climate change and the public.<br />Mr. Macron wanted a national referendum that would amend the constitution to “guarantee” environmental protection. This requires support from both houses of the French Parliament. The National Assembly, controlled by Mr. Macron’s party, approved the referendum this year.<br />The Senate announced Monday that it had voted to block the process. The upper body, with a conservative majority, worried that “guarantee” meant climate change would come before other constitutional imperatives. They feared, not unreasonably, that this would stifle innovation and business. While many in France cling to its statist past, there is still a constituency for economic dynamism.<br />This isn’t the first time Mr. Macron’s obsession with climate has wasted valuable time and political capital. Although the yellow-vest protests covered sundry domestic woes, they began as a response to a fuel-tax hike. The demonstrations led Mr. Macron to form the Citizens Convention for Climate, a body of 150 randomly selected French citizens. They came up with the climate amendment, which Mr. Macron wasted months fighting for.<br />The real shame is that Mr. Macron’s growth agenda would do more for the environment than punishing rural drivers or fiddling with the constitution. A more innovation-oriented French economy would produce companies and technology that solve environmental problems.</td>

      <td>The woke are angry, humorless, and—worst of all—vindictive. Surrender is not an option.</td>
      <td>I happened to mention the phrase “culture war” in a 1996 conversation with Irving Kristol, who was a contributor to these pages and always a penetrating observer of contemporary American life. “The culture war is over,” Irving said, then paused and added: “We lost.” Alive today, Irving would have been sadly reaffirmed in his declaration, surprised perhaps only at the extent of the loss and the cost it has entailed.<br />His “we” would include those people who believe in the rewards owed to effort and merit, the value of tradition, and the crucial significance of liberty. “We” would distinctly not include those who believe in the importance of spreading “diversity,” “inclusion” and “equity” as conceived by present-day universities. Nor would it include those whose sense of virtue derives from their putative hunger for social justice and their willingness to make severe judgments of others based on lapses from political correctness. These people are “they,” the woke, who have, as Kristol had it, won the culture war.<br />The extent of the woke victory is perhaps best demonstrated by the long list of cultural institutions they have captured and now control. Two of the country’s important newspapers, the  New York Times  and the Washington Post, are unashamedly woke. The New Yorker and the Atlantic have ceased to be general-interest magazines and are now specific-interest publications—that interest being the spread of woke ideas. The major television networks early fell in line without a fight.<br />Universities, in their humanities and social-sciences divisions, are not merely devoted to the propagation of woke ideas but initiate most of them. In turning away from the ideals of authority and objectivity in favor of clearly partisan views, these institutions have lost their former prestige yet are apparently sustained by the confidence that preaching woke doctrine is a higher calling.<br />Under the deep division in the country, certain prizes—Pulitzers, MacArthur grants, honorary degrees—go almost exclusively to people whose views are woke. (Presidential medals—in the humanities, in the arts, for freedom—are dictated by whether the president in office is woke or not.) Under political correctness, one of the main planks in the woke platform, freedom in the arts is vastly curtailed owing to strictures against what is known as “appropriation,” which disapproves of whites writing about blacks, men about women, heterosexuals about homosexuals. Under woke culture, art is vastly inhibited; humor, because so much of comedy is politically incorrect, largely excluded.</td>

      <td>The justices upheld our common-sense election laws against baseless charges of racism.</td>
      <td>Protecting the right to vote while maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the results is every public servant’s sacred duty. With that in mind, I defended Arizona’s election safeguards before the Supreme Court in March. Last week, in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, the justices ruled 6-3 in our favor, reaffirming the ability of states to administer secure elections with outcomes every voter can trust.<br />The Democratic National Committee asked the court in 2016 to strike down Arizona’s statutes on in-precinct voting and ballot harvesting as violations of the Voting Rights Act. The DNC didn’t have a sound or compelling argument, so it lapsed into calling Arizona “racist” for passing the law. I am thankful the justices saw through this partisan attack and upheld our common-sense measures. The court’s ruling is a win for election integrity at a time when the far left conducts propaganda campaigns to trick people into believing any election law that protects against voter fraud is “Jim Crow 2.0.”<br />The irony is that the DNC chose to attack Arizona, a state that offers some of the most convenient ways to vote. You can vote early in-person, vote on Election Day, or request a no-excuse absentee ballot. Don’t want to get out of the car? We also have drive-through ballot drop-off sites. Contrast that with other jurisdictions such as Delaware, Connecticut and New York, which require bureaucrats to approve your reason for absentee voting. Why are those requirements not being challenged? It’s clear that the DNC prefers to pursue its partisan power plays in what it deems to be battleground states.<br />In 2016 the Arizona Legislature established new guidelines restricting who can collect and deliver another person’s ballot, a practice that has become known as “ballot harvesting.” Ballot harvesting often exploits vulnerable communities when third parties not only gather and claim to deliver all ballots, but also “assist” people in filling them out. This opens the door and rolls out the carpet for anyone who may be attempting to commit voter fraud or intimidation.<br />Arizona’s Legislature passed ballot-harvesting protections in 2016 after the city of Phoenix warned of unauthorized people going door-to-door to collect early ballots while purporting to be city election officials. Civil-rights leaders—including Michael Johnson, who previously served on Phoenix City Council, and the Arizona Latino Republican Association for Tucson Chapter—raised concerns about elderly and vulnerable communities being targeted by ballot-harvesting activists. With the common-sense guidelines that are now law, only a family or household member, caregiver, mail carrier or elections official is authorized to deliver your ballot. That provides acceptable levels of ballot security, convenience and peace of mind that we should all be able to agree on.</td>

      <td>Democratic congressional leaders threaten to scuttle it unless they get a partisan spending bill.</td>
      <td>‘There ain’t gonna be no bipartisan bill unless we’re going to have a reconciliation bill,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said recently. Translation: Democrats won’t reach across party lines to pass infrastructure legislation unless they pass another spending bill with no Republican support.<br />I worked closely with Mrs. Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for decades. They’re both great people and skilled legislative tacticians, and they apparently think this strategy is the only way to hold their fragile majorities together and give all Democrats at least some of what they want.<br />I hope they rethink their strategy. President Biden has agreed to an infrastructure proposal with a bipartisan Senate group and the House Problem Solvers Caucus. Linking it to a separate multitrillion-dollar partisan reconciliation bill would likely end with passage of neither. The American people wouldn’t soon forgive this failure, and they’d blame Mr. Biden and Democrats because we’re in the majority.<br />That risk became clearer last week when Mr. Biden went to Wisconsin to advocate for the bipartisan agreement, which would be the largest federal infrastructure investment since the creation of the Interstate Highway System 65 years ago. The president said the plan would create millions of good jobs and ensure America can compete with China. It would replace 100% of the lead water pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 school across America, repair roads and bridges, upgrade the power grid, close the digital divide, make U.S. coastlines more resilient against climate change, and entail the largest investment in public transit in American history.<br />In other words, the president’s essential message in Wisconsin was that this is a historic plan every American should be very excited about, while the message from Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer in Washington is that we can’t have this infrastructure plan until Congress is done debating and voting for a separate, controversial, costly bill that may or may not pass months from now.</td>

      <td>Western European leaders see less threat from China and Russia than U.S. and Eastern European ones do.</td>
      <td>President Biden is reviving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—or is he? With President Trump gone, the alliance is back to business as usual, and Mr. Biden has emphasized members’ “sacred obligation” under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which governs how members respond to an attack on a fellow member. But a military alliance needs a military. Without a clear pathway to European rearmament, NATO won’t be able to respond to a crisis.<br />“The money is there to rebuild the allied militaries,” a European colleague observes. “The problem is the politics of it.” Translation: Genuine rearmament across the alliance would signal that Europe is ready to take military action alongside the U.S. and could put European access to Russian oil or Chinese markets at risk. If European NATO allies began to show real exercised military capabilities, it would signal to Moscow and Beijing that NATO is willing to ensure deterrence in Europe holds, freeing the bulk of American military power for the Indo-Pacific.<br />This clearly isn’t going to happen soon. Vladimir Putin’s seizure of Crimea in 2014 and the war in eastern Ukraine demarcate a polarization of NATO members. On one side, Poland, Romania and the Baltic states see Russia as a clear and present danger, determined to expand its portion of the post-Cold War settlement. On the other side is a very cautious Western Europe, wary of endangering economic growth over the well-being of their formerly Soviet-dominated neighbors. Berlin seems intent on managing rather than opposing Russia through a mix of political and economic engagement.<br />Looking farther abroad, while Washington sees China as both a military and economic problem, Europe considers it a strategic challenge but also an economic opportunity. The Asian market is seen as too critical to Europe’s prosperity to risk angering Beijing. Germany is deeply invested in Asian markets, and staking a clear position on the brewing Sino-American conflict isn’t in its interest. France’s security priorities are focused southward, toward the Mediterranean and Africa, not eastward. These disparate interests across Europe make a NATO-wide consensus on threats hard to achieve.<br />Some observers look back fondly on the Cold War, when NATO members’ goals were tightly aligned. That time has passed. U.S. power has been depleted by globalization and deindustrialization, decades of war in Afghanistan and the Middle East, and political polarization at home. As American global leadership falters, Europe has been increasingly adrift as it tries—somewhat awkwardly—to weigh its options. Russia has exploited these fissures while China has transformed itself into a power in Europe by investing in European technology companies.</td>

      <td>Between the wars, Russia offered a place for the German army to develop weapons and train men in violation of the Versailles Treaty.</td>
      <td>Adolf Hitler gets the blame for lighting the fuse of World War II, and for good reason. Yet Germany had a partner in Soviet Russia, not only during the infamous Hitler-Stalin Pact of 1939 but well before, starting with the Treaty of Rapallo in 1922. Without his enablers in Moscow, it’s hard to imagine that Hitler would have dared go to war against the rest of Europe.<br />In “Faustian Bargain,” Ian Ona Johnson shows how extensive Russia’s help was. He begins the story at the end of World War I, which had left the world with two pariah states: Germany because it had begun hostilities, Russia because the Bolshevik Revolution had transformed the country from a wartime ally to a postwar menace. Hardly had the ink dried on the punitive peace treaty signed at Versailles in June 1919 than the two pariahs joined forces.<br />As Mr. Johnson chronicles, Russia offered a place for the German army to develop weapons and train men in violation of the treaty that its civilian government had just signed. In return, Russia would learn how to modernize the Red Army, huge in size but badly trained and poorly equipped. The agreement was formalized at Rapallo, Italy. “Poland must and will be wiped off the map,” wrote Gen. Hans von Seeckt, the man who established Sondergruppe Russland (Special Group Russia), the bureau that would manage military relations between Germany and Russia. Seeckt was referring, of course, to the country that Versailles had resurrected between them. (Poland had been divided between Germany, Russia and the now-vanished Austro-Hungarian Empire.) “It was not an unfair peace that motivated Seeckt and his fellow officers,” Mr. Johnson writes. “It was the far more ambitious aim of reversing Germany’s defeat in the First World War.”<br />Mr. Johnson, who teaches military history at Notre Dame, draws on American, British, German, Polish and Russian archives to describe a “secret school of war.” The resulting book has an academic flavor, but it’s consistently interesting and spiced by the occasional scandal, including one in which a German naval officer brings his Russian girlfriend home to Germany, supporting her through a movie studio he purchased with government money, planning to use it for military propaganda. When the studio goes bankrupt, damning details emerge, triggering high-level resignations and bringing to light “the breadth of Germany’s commitment to rearm.”<br />In the 1920s, without troubling the civilian government in Berlin, the Reichswehr (German defense force) set up a ring of bases south and east of Moscow. German companies like Junkers and Krupp contracted directly with the Soviet government to manufacture warplanes in Russia, deliver coveted German-built locomotives and train Red Army technicians. Versailles had banned all offensive weapons, but the “Black Reichswehr” in Russia included warplanes, battle tanks and poison gas. Russia, for its part, learned alongside the Germans. Stalin was so interested in Krupp’s tank designer Eduard Grotte that he ordered that the man be kept in Russia by “all measures up to arrest.”</td>

      <td>After a drug test picked up marijuana and knocked her out of the 100-meter event, USA Track & Field declined to select her for a relay in Tokyo</td>
      <td>Team USA’s roster of track and field athletes at the Tokyo Olympics will be missing its  biggest newsmaker ahead of the Games: sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson.<br />The 21-year-old winner of the U.S. Olympic track and field trials’ women’s 100 meters last month was left off the team named Tuesday by USA Track & Field, after an anti-doping test detected a chemical found in marijuana. Richardson was disqualified from the 100 meters, but USATF, the sport’s national governing body, had the option to select her to run in a relay in Tokyo. It declined.<br />“While USATF fully agrees that the merit of the World Anti-Doping Agency rules related to THC should be reevaluated, it would be detrimental to the integrity of the U.S. Olympic Team Trials for Track & Field if USATF amended its policies following competition, only weeks before the Olympic Games,” USATF  said in a statement Tuesday.<br />“All USATF athletes are equally aware of and must adhere to the current anti-doping code, and our credibility as the National Governing Body would be lost if rules were only enforced under certain circumstances.”<br />The statement praised Richardson’s accountability and said that USATF will offer her “our continued support both on and off the track.”</td>

      <td>Falling shares of Didi, Full Truck, Kanzhun drag Tencent Music, Baidu and other Chinese stocks lower</td>
      <td>Chinese technology stocks fell Tuesday after China’s cybersecurity regulator widened its review of several of the country’s newest public companies.<br />Ride-hailing giant  Didi Global Inc.  shed nearly a third of its value since shares spiked as high as $18 apiece on June 30, the day of the company’s public debut. Last week Chinese officials banned the company from adding new users and launched a probe of the company’s data practices.<br />On Monday, Chinese officials announced similar probes into other newly public Chinese tech companies—truck-hailing app  Full Truck Alliance Co.  and an online recruiting app  Kanzhun Ltd. —sending shares of those stocks and countless others in the region sputtering. On Tuesday, Full Truck slid nearly 6.7% and Kanzhun fell 16%.  Baidu Inc.,   Tencent Music Entertainment Group ,   JD.com Inc.  and  Pinduoduo Inc.  slid between 5% and 6.8%.<br />The latest regulatory actions and stock moves have confounded emerging-market investors, who say they feel stuck between balancing their bullish outlooks on the growth of Chinese tech stocks against increasingly aggressive regulatory attacks from both China and the U.S.<br />“I understand the market; investors hate uncertainty,” said Brendan Ahern, the chief investment officer for KraneShares in New York, of the pullback in Chinese tech stocks. “But despite all the regulatory bark, there’s been no real financial bite to it.”</td>

      <td>Judge says he can’t try the antitrust case before the acquisition’s current Sept. 9 expiration date</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal judge said he can’t schedule a summer trial in the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit challenging insurance broker  Aon  PLC’s proposed acquisition of rival  Willis Towers Watson  PLC, a blow to Aon’s bid to save a deal that expires Sept. 9.<br />U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton instead said Tuesday he plans to hold trial proceedings for a few days beginning Nov. 18, and then again during an opening in his schedule from Dec. 20-22. A decision could take weeks or months after those proceedings conclude.<br />The judge said that he faced a huge backlog of cases because of the coronavirus pandemic. He said that the November and December dates for the Aon litigation may slip, because he also is presiding over several cases related to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, which take priority because of defendants’ speedy-trial rights.<br />“I understand the desire to try and get the case to trial as quickly as possible, but I think it’s impractical,” the judge said during a scheduling hearing.<br />Aon and Willis Towers, both registered in Ireland, announced their roughly $30 billion deal in March 2020. They are two of the world’s biggest insurance brokerages by revenue, alongside New York-based Marsh & McLennan Cos. The brokerages help companies buy insurance and advise them on risk management and are also major consultants to businesses on health and other benefit packages for their employees.</td>

      <td>Heliogen Inc. is merging with a special-purpose acquisition company to go public in a combination that values the concentrated solar power company at about $2 billion, the companies said.<br />Founded in 2013, Heliogen uses mirrors that are positioned with artificial intelligence to reflect sunlight at a small receiver, generating an intense heat. That sunlight can be collected and processed to generate electricity even when the sun goes down, the company says. The renewable energy can also be used to power industrial processes needed to make materials like steel and to produce hydrogen fuel.<br />The company’s CEO is angel investor and entrepreneur Bill Gross—sometimes confused with the bond investor Bill Gross, who co-founded investment giant Pacific Investment Management Co. Heliogen’s Mr. Gross has made a fortune backing internet startups through his Idealab incubator and is now focusing on renewable energy companies. The firm expects to install its first commercial project in 2023.<br />Heliogen is combining with the SPAC Athena Technology Acquisition Corp., one of the few so-called blank-check companies led by women. Cybersecurity executive and former U.S. Army officer Phyllis Newhouse and venture capitalist Isabelle Freidheim are the SPAC’s CEO and board chair, respectively. Former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is one of its advisers.<br />Based in Pasadena, Calif., Heliogen has been testing its technology in a demonstration facility since 2019. It now hopes to scale operations to bring down costs and emissions in energy-intensive industries like mining, Mr. Gross said in an interview.</td>

      <td>The sequel keeps Kristen Bell as narrator, but replaces the rest of its original whitewashed, cisgender characters with a more diverse crew of Upper East Side elites.</td>
      <td>The fictional Constance Billard School—Upper East Side academy of social-media influence, nonbinary sexual athleticism and bile—boasts a number of prominent alumni. Caroline Kennedy. The novelist Colson Whitehead. Supreme Court Justice Byron White. And Nate Archibald, whom one might presume to mean the former point guard and NBA Hall of Famer. One would be wrong.<br />The Nate Archibald cited in the newly rebooted “Gossip Girl”—as those in the know will know—was one of the more prominent characters in the original, which ran on the CW from 2007-12 and was a high-school soap with a new-media spin: The eponymous, anonymous narrator (voice of Kristen Bell) was a social tattler with a blog that kept tabs on the ornate goings-on at Constance and served as its Proustian Page Six. Or, as someone in the new show “remembers,” an “Orwellian Big Sister.”<br />The revamped “GG,” with Ms. Bell’s voice returning omnisciently, cross-pollinates the show’s history with real history and people. It cites Hannah Horvath (the protagonist of “Girls”) as a literary reference. It frames the online prose stylings of certain characters in a comparative-lit context (“It’s like E.M. Forster got roofied by Dorothy Parker and Jacqueline Susann!”). One father recalls Alec Baldwin confiscating his cellphone on Parent-Teacher Night and not giving it back. The show straddles true and false as if it were astride a slippery English saddle. The jokes are often of a very sophisticated variety. Likewise, the sex.<br />Nate “Tiny” Archibald would not have fit in among the alabaster-hued student body of the original show, but that’s one thing about the reboot that’s changed for the better; both female leads are Black, for one thing. Less uplifting will be the level of debauchery and lack of visible education portrayed here. Homework? It takes a back seat to alcohol-and-ecstasy-fueled soirees in Dumbo and pyrotechnical fashion shows at the Park Avenue Armory aplenty.<br />The Queen Bee of Constance is Julien Calloway (the spectacular Jordan Alexander) who, abetted by venomous sidekicks Luna La and Monet de Haan (Zión Moreno and Savannah Smith), maintains a social stranglehold on a school where grades are manipulated and teachers are terrorized. The staff is impotent because the true lesson of Constance Billard is that education is unnecessary when you come from extreme wealth (which the students do, with a few dramatically necessary exceptions). Julien has created an empire of product endorsements, clothing, unearned sociopolitical clout and an Instagram following worth a fortune, but this is largely because she’s already rich and thus an object of worship. It’s all fantasy, of course. But even good sci-fi contains a kernel of truth.</td>

Deals with those brands “represented hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue in 2019,” the lawsuit added.<br />“Esquel’s reputation as a global leader in sustainable textile manufacturing, built up over many years, has been deeply tarnished by the Trump administration’s reckless labeling of Esquel as a company” that threatens U.S. national security, the lawsuit said.<br />A Commerce Department representative said that it doesn’t comment on litigation.</td>

      <td>Comcast Corp.’s  new streaming service Peacock is about to get a big boost from sister movie studio Universal Pictures.<br />Starting in 2022, theatrical releases from Universal—including the next “Jurassic World” and new “Halloween” movie—will have their TV debut on Peacock, the streamer launched by its parent company last year.<br />The movies will appear on Peacock no later than four months after their theatrical premiere, joining other studios drastically shortening the length of time they typically wait to make their biggest releases available on the small screen. But it also gives Universal a much-needed advantage over its streaming competitors when every studio’s biggest releases are made available as soon as possible.<br />By giving its Peacock service greater priority in distribution, Comcast continues its focus on direct-to-consumer offerings that value subscriber growth and retention above all else. Rivals at  Walt Disney Co.  and ViacomCBS Inc. have taken similar approaches that use marquee titles from a decades-old studio to bolster the appeal of relatively new streaming services. With Wall Street watching for any signs of subscriber losses, studios and their parent companies have broken once-sacrosanct practices to give their services an edge.<br />While theatrical movies have been strong performers on streaming services, it isn’t clear whether Universal’s move will produce the boost in subscribers it is seeking. Evidence of viewership at most streaming services remains opaque compared with publicly reported box-office tallies, and newer entrants like Peacock have found it hard to siphon viewers from entrenched players like  Netflix Inc.</td>

The paid, part-time roles, which began this month and run into September, provide mentoring and job experience, officials said.<br />NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Community Partnerships Chauncey Parker said that the NYPD is working to build partnerships with young people through other programs such as funding the renovation of basketball courts with assets seized in criminal cases.<br />The rise in violent crime during the Covid-19 pandemic heightened the need for partnerships between officers and the community, Mr. Parker said. “They’ve never been more important than they are at this moment,” he said.</td>

The ministry said it produced the efficacy percentage of the vaccine by analyzing the number of infections among the vaccinated compared to those unvaccinated in the given period, while also accounting for influential factors such as the week of infection, age and whether the person was infected in the past.<br />During the period that coincided with the Delta outbreak, 1,271 of 1,528 total new infections were fully vaccinated individuals, as were 23 of 37 hospitalizations and 11 of 17 cases of severe illness, the ministry said.</td>

In addition to  Microsoft  and Amazon, officials said qualified bidders could include  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google,  Oracle Corp.  and  IBM Corp.<br />Bidders are expected to be identified by about October, the officials said, with the new contract expected to be awarded in spring 2022.

      <td>Prices for U.S. grains are locked in a volatile pattern as growing areas of the country wait for rain.<br />Following the long holiday weekend, grain futures trading on the Chicago Board of Trade have plummeted to start the week. Most-active corn futures closed Tuesday down by their limit of 40 cents a bushel, falling 6.9% to $5.40 a bushel. Soybean futures fell 6.7% to $13.05 a bushel, and wheat dropped 4.1% to $6.26 a bushel.<br />Today’s move lower essentially erases upticks seen last week, when futures soared after the U.S. Department of Agriculture released two key reports detailing the outlook for grains supplies and demand. Last Wednesday, the most-active corn contract on the Chicago Board of Trade soared 7% to $5.88 per bushel, while soybeans climbed more than 6% to nearly $14 per bushel. Wheat rose more than 5% following the report’s release.<br />Heading into the hottest days of the summer, above-average temperatures and dry conditions in the forecast may roil crop production in areas already in the grips of a drought. The volatility in agricultural futures is linked to the uncertainty that growing regions will get the rain they need.<br />“Now is when rains will become more critical though as developing crops require more moisture as they progress,” said Karl Setzer, a commodity risk adviser with AgriVisor, in a note Friday.</td>

      <td>Opposition to boosting share count may cool some of theater chain’s consolidation dreams</td>
      <td>Even the most enthusiastic movie fans get sequel fatigue. The same seems to apply to investors in movie-theater chains.<br />AMC Entertainment  on Monday said it was dropping plans to have shareholders vote to approve the issuance of 25 million new shares. That vote was scheduled to take place at the company’s annual meeting on July 29. The plan apparently drew enough vocal opposition from the company’s new base of mostly individual investors to cause the about-face; Chief Executive Adam Aron described the feedback as “many yes, many no” in a tweet Monday morning. “AMC does not want to proceed with such a split,” he added.<br />The move is a setback for both AMC and Mr. Aron, who has leaned much more aggressively into the meme-stock craze than have his counterparts at  GameStop .  The once-troubled theater chain made three stock sales between late April and early June, raising a total of about $1.2 billion. And Mr. Aron has been heavily campaigning on Twitter for the new shares, which he has said would help fuel expansion and investments in growth. The pandemic forced many smaller theater operators to close their doors permanently, giving large chains such as AMC,  Cineworld  and  Cinemark  the opportunity to pick up share.<br />But even the investors who have propelled meme stocks to dizzying heights seem to have their limits. GameStop’s stock price has slid 35% since the company used its fiscal first-quarter report on June 8 to announce plans to file papers for the sale of up to 5 million new shares. The company had already sold 3.5 million shares for $551 million in April. Before Monday’s open, AMC shares were down 17% since the June 3 announcement of the latest stock sale. The company also separately announced its plan to seek approval for 25 million new shares later that day.<br />To be sure, both stocks are trading on astounding gains for the year. And the money already raised has gone a long way to shoring up the balance sheets of two businesses still facing substantial risk of being disintermediated by digital competition. For AMC, having more than a billion dollars of new cash in the bank less than a year after flirting with bankruptcy will have to be enough of a happy ending.</td>

      <td>Bobby Jindal has good ideas for how “Republicans Can Lead on Healthcare Reform” (op-ed, June 25). But without congressional action on decades of misguided legislation and regulatory provisions that control the structure of the system, nothing will be accomplished. For instance, discussion about addressing “overconsolidation among hospitals” is fruitless without paying attention to the provisions under ObamaCare that have put this consolidation in overdrive. ObamaCare is far more encompassing than the insurance provisions that are the typical focus of attention. It is the job of Congress to provide benefits, but Congress needs to leave it up to industry to innovate and compete to deliver the services.<br />Brook Chambery<br />Rochester, N.Y.<br /><br />The price transparency for which Mr. Jindal argues already exists—for insurance companies. Insurers have negotiated prices for hospital and other medical services that are significantly lower than providers’ list prices.

      <td>It needed free markets based on secure private-property rights and a just rule of law.</td>
      <td>“Milton Friedman, Wrong on China?” wonders William McGurn (Main Street, June 29). I think not. At the 1988 Cato Institute conference, cosponsored with Fudan University in Shanghai, Friedman reminded his audience of advice he had given to Chinese officials in 1980. He had advocated “the widest possible use not of the market but of ‘free private markets.’” Markets, as places of exchange, are pervasive. But China needs a system of free markets based on secure private-property rights and a just rule of law. This includes a free market for ideas, in which people criticize government and violations of human rights without fear of reprisal.<br />James A. Dorn<br />Cato Institute<br />Washington</td>

      <td>Hack is latest in string of high-profile incidents demanding payment to unlock computers</td>
      <td>A group of Russian hackers calling themselves REvil is demanding $70 million to unlock computers swept up in a widespread ransomware attack that started to unfold July 2. It is the latest of such high-profile incidents that the U.S. government has been trying to stamp out, along with other cybercrimes.<br />Kaseya Ltd. is a Miami-based company that provides software to help other businesses manage their networks. The hackers targeted Kaseya’s virtual systems/server administrator (VSA), a type of software that large companies and technology-service providers use to manage and send out software updates to systems on computer networks. The hackers were able to distribute ransomware by exploiting several vulnerabilities in the VSA software, a Kaseya spokeswoman said.<br />By targeting Kaseya’s VSA, the hackers were able to open the door to infect more computers in what is known as a supply-chain attack. About 50 of Kaseya’s immediate customers were compromised and about 40 of those customers were sellers of information-technology services, which potentially let the hackers reach more victims, the company’s chief executive, Fred Voccola, said. The company’s own corporate systems weren’t compromised, he said.<br />Kaseya on July 5 said fewer than 1,500 businesses in total were likely hit. Many of those companies are small and midsize businesses with little direct exposure to consumers, though a Swedish supermarket chain was forced to close some outlets over the weekend because of the attack.<br />Supply-chain attacks like the one involving Kaseya have long been a concern for cybersecurity professionals, even more so after last year’s so-called  SolarWinds  hack. In that sophisticated cyberheist, the perpetrators linked by U.S. authorities to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service were able to install tainted network-monitoring software to gain access to sometimes sensitive company and government data.</td>

      <td>Half a century ago, he foretold the loss of American pre-eminence.</td>
      <td>The U.S. has been through dark times before—and in living memory. Fifty years ago this week, President Richard Nixon spoke frankly about America’s doldrums in a speech that didn’t get enough attention from the media at the time or historians since. On July 6, 1971, the 37th president addressed senior midwestern media executives in Kansas City, Mo., amid racial unrest, campus agitation and antiwar protests.<br />The columns of the National Archives Building in Washington reminded Nixon of ancient fallen empires. “I think of what happened to Greece and Rome, and you see what is left—only the pillars. What has happened, of course, is that the great civilizations of the past, as they have become wealthy, as they have lost their will to live, to improve, they then have become subject to decadence that eventually destroys the civilization.” Nixon’s lament: “The United States is now reaching that period.”<br />America, he said, needed to find the “moral and spiritual strength” to shape the emerging post-Vietnam era. Counterculture revolutionaries wanted to define America as “an ugly country.” Nixon urged his countrymen to reject “negativism” and “defeatism” and concentrate on building a nation that was “healthy” both morally and physically.<br />“The United States no longer is in the position of complete pre-eminence or predominance,” he said, because “we now face a situation where four other powers”—the Soviet Union, Western Europe, Japan and China—“have the ability to challenge us on every front.” Yet this “can be a constructive thing.” A few months later, he told Time magazine: “I think it will be a safer world and a better world if we have a strong, healthy United States, Europe, Soviet Union, China, Japan, each balancing the other.”<br />Here was the old Cold Warrior calling on fellow citizens to adapt to decline in a more plural international environment. He wanted to adopt policies that would smooth the path of a more limited U.S. role in foreign affairs: détente with the Soviets, abandonment of Bretton-Woods dollar-gold link, and the opening to China. As Nixon spoke, national security adviser Henry Kissinger was secretly en route to Beijing to plan the first presidential visit to China.</td>

Now, they risk becoming a mechanism through which the Taliban could legitimize their recent military victories, gaining international approval for an eventual takeover, Afghan government representatives warn.<br />“The delays that we see from the other side in the progress of talks are not corresponding to the sense of urgency that we have. The violence needs to end, the war needs to end, and we need to reach a political settlement,” said senior government negotiator Nader Nadery, who heads Afghanistan’s civil service commission. “Are they hoping to take over militarily, and then to give it some sort of cover, to say ‘Oh, we are talking in Doha?’ We are aware of these traps.”<br />The Taliban agreed to sit down for negotiations with representatives of President Ashraf Ghani’s government and other major political forces in Kabul as part of the February 2020 deal between the insurgent group and the Trump administration to pull out all American forces from the country.</td>

      <td>The San Francisco region has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country but one of the lowest return-to-office rates, a disconnect that bodes ill for the future of the city that had been the booming center of the U.S. technology sector before the pandemic.<br />As of July 4, about 76% of eligible San Francisco residents have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, compared with 67% for the U.S. as a whole, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the San Francisco area trails the rest of the country in going back to the office—with less than 20% of the city’s workforce returned as of mid-June, compared with a U.S. average of 32%, according to Kastle Systems, a nationwide security company that monitors access-card swipes.<br />The decreased foot traffic has meant many of the stores and restaurants in San Francisco’s once-thriving business district remain closed. “It’s a ghost town,” said Steve Sarver, owner of the Ladle & Leaf group of restaurants, which has kept only one of its eight downtown locations in the city open.<br />A major reason for the delayed return to normal is that technology companies are proving to be among the slowest to repopulate office space, as well as the most flexible in allowing employees to keep working from home after the health crisis ends, say companies, brokers and landlords in the Bay Area.<br />Companies in other businesses in other regions of the U.S. also are adopting hybrid strategies that include office and remote work as the country reopens. But workplace boundaries are being pushed the furthest by technology companies in the San Francisco region, such as  Salesforce.com Inc.,   Dropbox Inc.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google, as they try to appeal to their younger highly skilled workers who like working remotely.</td>

      <td>Fractures are resurfacing at oil cartel OPEC+. The safest course of action might be to test out a higher return of barrels.</td>
      <td>All things considered, it is impressive that Saudi Arabia has managed to stay in the driver’s seat at OPEC+ meetings thus far. It may be time to loosen its grip.<br />In a meeting last Thursday, the cartel was widely expected to increase its output by roughly half a million barrels per day starting August. But the United Arab Emirates, which had been itching to open up its taps for some time, left the meeting deadlocked with no new date announced.<br />There are a couple of reasons for the U.A.E.’s reluctance. As a percentage of capacity, the country is suppressing more supply than anyone else, according to analysis from energy economist Philip Verleger. The country has invested heavily to boost capacity in recent years. And as always, there are geopolitical undercurrents: The split comes as the U.A.E. diverges with Saudi Arabia on several fronts, including the former’s decision to normalize diplomatic ties with Israel.<br />The rift is no doubt bullish for oil in the short term, though markets are rightly cautious. Brent crude slipped more than 2% to $75.59 on Tuesday morning. It is still up more than 45% year to date.<br />What next? The most alarming scenario would be if the U.A.E. were to drop out of the alliance completely, stoking chaos. On the safer end of the spectrum, Saudi Arabia could step in—as it did in January—to sacrifice some of its own production while allowing disgruntled members (it was Russia and Kazakhstan the last time around) to increase output moderately. The latter option, however, could set a bad precedent for future meetings if it encourages future standoffs.</td>

      <td>Alcohol always requires care in a professional setting, and the return to socializing with co-workers may call for some extra thought</td>
      <td>When Michelle Marks went out for drinks with her co-workers one weeknight in late May, the group, giddy at finally gathering together, celebrated for about four hours.<br />“We closed out the place,” says the 32-year-old plant pathologist from Columbia, Md. “We ended up just chatting and we ordered pizza, played a few board games…It was just really, really nice.”<br />As excited as Ms. Marks, who started her current job a month before Covid-19 lockdowns, was to take part in this office-life fixture and just be out with others again socially, she didn’t plunge in with abandon. She stuck to her pre-pandemic office drinks rule of just one or two beverages. “I would never get drunk in the presence of co-workers,” she says.<br />As society emerges from lockdowns and people reconnect with co-workers at in-person happy hours, many may have to remind themselves just how to do work drinks. More than a year away from this kind of setting means social skills may have gotten rusty. Introverts and others who were already anxious about after-work mixers might feel more anxious now that these functions are resuming.<br />Working from home put on hold some of the professional code-switching that people engage in when in person with others. The return of work socials and networking requires some refreshers on appropriate behavior and imbibing, especially with alcohol present.</td>

At the time, subsisting on small amounts of rice, occasional scraps of meat and a spinach-like vegetable the prisoners dubbed “green horror,” he wasn’t certain he would survive long enough to have a career.<br />When the Japanese military released him in 1945 after nearly four years, however, he took the suggestion of a fellow prisoner and applied for work at  National Cash Register Co. , later known as  NCR Corp.<br />Mr. Anderson, who died June 29 at the age of 102, impressed his bosses by managing rapid growth in Asia, making NCR Japan one of the company’s most profitable offshoots. In 1972, NCR’s board, alarmed by deteriorating results elsewhere, reached across the Pacific to name him president of the parent company, based in Dayton, Ohio. He soon rose to chief executive and chairman, even though he had made his career entirely outside the U.S.<br />The same self-belief that kept Mr. Anderson alive as a POW gave him confidence he could save NCR.<br />“The most important message I try to get across to our managers all over the world is that we are in trouble but we will overcome it,” he told Business Week, which reported that he had the “stance and mien of a middleweight boxer.”</td>

Doxing is a term applied to the sharing of individuals’ information online so they can be harassed, a practice that was common during 2019 protests in the city.<br />The letter from the Singapore-based Asia Internet Coalition said the planned rules could put companies’ staff at risk of criminal investigations or prosecutions related to what the firms’ users post online. Tech companies could cease providing services in the city if authorities proceeded with the changes, it added.<br />“There is wide support that doxing should be legislated against,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Tuesday at a news conference at which she was asked about the letter from the industry group. “All pieces of legislation including the National Security Law will attract concern,” she said, referring to a law imposed on the city by China a year ago to quash opposition in the city, but in the legislative process “we will try to address these concerns.”<br />She added, “If online companies express their concern, I’m sure that the privacy commissioner is more than happy to meet with them to listen to their concerns.”</td>

Now, retailers themselves are stockpiling to keep costs down and protect margins.<br />“We’re buying a lot of everything. Our inventories are up significantly over the same period last year,” said David Smith, chief executive officer of Associated Wholesale Grocers Inc.

      <td>Plan draws praise from early childhood education advocates, but Republicans are skeptical on implementation</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden’s $200 billion proposal to expand publicly funded prekindergarten through a program that requires buy-in and funds from states is facing questions from Republicans over how it will be implemented.<br />Most states currently offer some public preschool, with both Republicans and Democrats often backing the efforts, but the standards and spending vary. Mr. Biden is seeking to provide prekindergarten to all 3- and 4-year-olds as part of his $1.8 trillion families plan, which also includes investments in child care, paid leave and community college.<br />Under his proposal, states would receive federal funding to help create programs or expand their current offerings, and they would need to put up some state funds and meet some standards in return.<br />The White House says an expansion will improve educational outcomes, while enabling parents of young children to participate fully in the workforce. But while many Republican leaders support public prekindergarten, some have expressed skepticism about what role the federal government should play in funding it and what strings will come with the money.<br />In Alabama, which has expanded its preschool program, a spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement that the governor doesn’t support Mr. Biden’s universal prekindergarten proposal, adding that “a top-down approach would simply not be beneficial to us.” She didn’t respond to queries about whether there were circumstances under which the state would accept the funding.</td>

      <td>Sales of bonds with borrowing costs linked to climate change have accelerated dramatically this year, led by companies with high carbon emissions, such as Canadian pipeline  operator Enbridge Inc.,  Italian energy giant  Enel  SpA and Spanish energy firm  Repsol SA .<br />More than $31 billion worth of sustainability-linked bonds have been sold in the past three months, according to Dealogic. That is more than the $23 billion sold between the first deal being done in 2019 and the start of the second quarter this year.<br />Enel, Repsol and Enbridge alone raised almost $7 billion from such bonds last month, as demand heated up from investors determined to try to help the global climate stay cool and gain good returns.<br />The market for sustainability-linked bonds is still relatively small compared with the green bond market, where borrowers raise funds for specific “green” projects. In contrast, sustainability-linked bonds can raise funds for any purpose, but borrowers risk higher interest costs if they fail to meet targets for goals such as cutting emissions or hiring more female executives.<br />When borrowing costs are linked to climate-related goals, these bonds are sometimes called “transition bonds.” Investors are keen on such bonds from the biggest polluters when those companies set ambitious and credible goals to cut their carbon emissions.</td>

It was the first time a Japanese car maker took the top position in the U.S., according to car-shopping website Edmunds.com, and came as the politically sensitive U.S. trade deficit is widening.<br />“Toyota thinks this was an unusual case due to production constraints and other factors,” spokeswoman Shino Yamada said. She called it a “short-term event for this quarter.”<br />Toyota bet earlier than most car makers on a recovering U.S. car market.  As a result, the company cut production and parts orders less sharply than competitors, making it better prepared for the current surge. But even Toyota wasn’t fully prepared for the frenzy of car buying.</td>

The dispute, litigated for months in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, centered over who should bear the enormous costs of capping and abandoning wells, primarily in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico where an oil spill could wreak havoc. The companies could still appeal the ruling.<br />The exact future costs of the cleanup are still unclear, but lawyers for BP estimated its liability could top $300 million, while lawyers for Exxon said its exposure could total as much as $373 million. A group of insurers said they could be on the hook for more than $1 billion.<br />For offshore wells—unlike most onshore wells—the Department of the Interior can hold previous operators liable for the cleanup if the current operator is unable to cover the expenses, to avoid taxpayers incurring the costs.</td>

      <td>At the fringes of Brazil’s vast farming heartland, technology startup Agrorobótica has built a device the size of an office printer to measure carbon in the soil and help farmers get certified for a budding carbon market.<br />Government officials, business executives and climate experts say Brazil, an agricultural powerhouse and home to most of the Amazon rainforest, could profit from policies that encourage sustainable farming practices and other methods of draining carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Such initiatives generate carbon credits that farmers can sell to companies under pressure to cancel out their own emissions.<br />Currently, Brazil has no mandatory emission caps, but food producers already sell carbon credits in so-called voluntary markets to corporations seeking to offset emissions. Carbon-market advocates say a more formal environment could deliver a boost to Brazil’s economy.<br />“The potential in Brazil to capture carbon is way higher than in many other countries,” largely due to the vast biodiversity found in rainforests, said Manuel Piñuela, co-founder and CEO of Cultivo, a California-based firm that connects potential buyers of so-called carbon offsets with climate-friendly projects to fund. He said Cultivo has identified 100,000 hectares of land in Brazil that could be added to its portfolio of projects in the next few months. Brazil’s share of the world’s carbon sequestration potential is 15%, a level matched only by Indonesia’s and well above that of the next highest, 5%, found in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to a report published in May by McKinsey & Co. and the World Economic Forum.<br />Global companies are already seeking to exploit Brazil’s potential to enhance their green credentials.</td>

The team that started as 25-to-1 longshots with the British bookmakers, faced a near-tragedy, and somehow pulled itself together will play England at Wembley Stadium on Wednesday night.<br />“It’s a little surreal right now to be here after everything that happened,” midfielder Thomas Delaney said. “It’s still something we’re struggling with.”<br />You wouldn’t know it from the way Denmark has performed since the group stage. With the swashbuckling approach of a squad that wasn’t supposed to last this long, the Danes have turned themselves into one of the most exciting offensive teams here.<br />Only Spain has averaged more goals per game or had more shots on target. And none of the four semifinalists has run further. It’s no coincidence that Denmark manager Kasper Hjulmand has taken full advantage of the Covid-era rule that allows teams five substitutions instead of the usual three—he has used all five changes in every match.</td>

      <td>Hong Kong is one of two territories, along with Macau, under Chinese Communist Party rule where Google,  Facebook  and  Twitter  are easily accessible. That may not last much longer.<br />The Asia Internet Coalition—an industry group that includes Facebook, Twitter and Google parent Alphabet—has privately warned the Hong Kong government that they might be forced to stop offering services in the city if proposed anti-doxing legislation is implemented. Doxing, putting individuals’ private information online to facilitate harassment by others, was widely used against the police during the antigovernment protests of 2019.<br />Tech companies worry the new rules could put their own employees at risk of becoming entangled in criminal investigations. According to amendments to Hong Kong’s data-protection laws proposed in May, doxing could result in penalties of up to 1 million Hong Kong dollars, the equivalent of about $128,700, and five years in prison.<br />While prohibiting doxing sounds reasonable in theory, the industry group is concerned that the vague wording of those amendments could be used to criminalize even innocuous acts of information sharing and that members or their employees could be liable for what users post. The broad wording of Hong Kong’s year-old national security law has been criticized on similar grounds. In a letter sent to the Hong Kong government, the Coalition suggested a more clearly defined scope for violations should be considered.<br />One potential impact is on staffing for global companies with outposts in Hong Kong. For many non-Chinese employees in the city, the new national security legislation has little direct impact on their daily lives, but Google and Facebook are services that many foreign residents use regularly. Expatriates living in mainland China are reliant on virtual private networks to disguise their location to access such services. Those networks can be finicky and the Chinese government actively attempts to disrupt them, often causing slow and unreliable connections for everyday tasks such as Google searches.</td>

Brent crude, the benchmark in global energy markets, rose 0.8% to $77.77 a barrel having rallied when the OPEC meeting was called off on Monday.<br />The jump extended U.S. crude’s advance this year to almost 60%, a surge powered by a revival in consumption of fossil fuels as vaccines roll out and major economies unlock. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, led by Russia, have continued to hold millions of barrels a day in the ground each day, limiting supplies.<br />Drivers are feeling the pinch at the pump. Heading into the July 4 weekend, Americans faced the steepest gasoline prices in nearly seven years at a national average of over $3 a gallon.<br />The latest climb in crude markets came after a Saudi Arabia-backed plan to boost output and tame the price rally failed to garner agreement.

That was down from 0.98 percentage point in May, marking the lowest level of intraday volatility within a month since December 2019, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.<br />After a notably quiet stretch, many analysts are anticipating a break in the lull. The simplest reason: Trading desks tend to become more lightly staffed during the summer as employees take off for the holidays. That generally means there is less liquidity in the markets.<br />In turn, any surprising economic data, corporate news or monetary-policy news tends to “hit the market harder than they otherwise might,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in an emailed note.<br />“And since volatility and returns have a negative correlation, this dynamic can make for difficult investment environments,” Mr. Colas said.</td>

Consulting firm BloombergNEF puts the global cost of greening grids at $14 trillion over the next three decades, compared with $15 trillion for power generation.<br />President Biden’s Senate-approved infrastructure plan includes $73 billion for power infrastructure, while Europe’s green deal has similar incentives. But cash alone might not be enough to unlock growth in an industry that already delivers regulated returns on equity in the high-single to low-double digits. Investors also need to watch Mr. Biden’s plan to create a new grid authority. A coordinating body that has the potential to really unleash U.S. network investment by cutting project risks.<br />Transmission lines are the biggest grid challenge. These high-voltage overhead power cables often cross communities to which they provide little or no benefit. Before starting construction on a new line, the builder must plan its path and then obtain permission from all affected states and municipalities.<br />It is a complex and time-consuming process: National plans aren’t necessarily reflected in local priorities and new lines can face fierce public opposition. It can take many years to obtain the permissions for a transmission line that can be built in one year.</td>

There were 22 passengers and 6 crew on board.<br />“At the time of landing, weather conditions were poor around the airport,” Russian wire services reported the state aviation agency, Rosaviatsiya, as saying. “Contact was lost through every available channel.”<br />Russia has made some strides in recent years to clean up its once dismal air safety record from the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2019, however, a Sukhoi Superjet 100 made a crash landing in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, killing 41 people on board and causing the rear of the plane to go up in flames.<br />Soviet-designed planes still used by smaller regional airlines across the country are considered reliable but have been involved in disasters in Russia and abroad and lack the technology of Western counterparts.</td>

      <td>JERUSALEM—Israel’s new government lost a parliamentary vote early Tuesday to extend a temporary law that bars citizenship for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza who are married to Israelis, an early setback for the fragile ruling coalition.<br />The vote ended in a tie following a long night of debate, requiring a simple majority for the law to be extended. Fifty-nine lawmakers voted for it and 59 against in the 120-member Knesset.<br />The law, which was first enacted in 2003 and has since been renewed every year, is set to expire Tuesday at midnight. The failure to extend it exposes the deep ideological differences within the broad coalition. Two Arab lawmakers in the coalition abstained from the vote and a member of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s right-wing Yamina party voted against the law.<br />At the last minute, Mr. Bennett declared the vote would also be a confidence motion on the government. It survived because such a vote would require an absolute majority to fail.<br />Israel’s left-wing and Arab lawmakers, including many in the current government, say the so-called citizenship law discriminates against the country’s Arab minority. The right-wing parties, including that of Mr. Bennett, say the measure is needed to maintain security and preserve Israel’s Jewish character.</td>

E.—typically one of Riyadh’s most dependable supporters in the group—refused to agree to a Saudi-backed deal to boost output, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal, tentatively approved by the rest of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the Russia-led group, together known as OPEC+, calls for unleashing millions of barrels a day of bottled-up crude to help tame steadily rising oil prices.<br />Oil prices rose to fresh multiyear highs after the OPEC meeting was called off as investors weighed whether the spat could endanger a near-term deal for more barrels. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1% to $76.96 a barrel, the highest level since late 2018.<br />The U.A.E. says it is asking for scope to produce more of its oil under any accord. Its unwillingness to compromise comes as Riyadh and Abu Dhabi—neighbors, military partners and traditional OPEC allies—diverge on several fronts, economic and geopolitical.<br />The U.A.E. has invested heavily in its own output—an effort aimed at pumping more oil, faster, to finance a transition to a more diverse economy. “The U.A.E.’s energy strategy has evolved to take into account energy transition, the speed at which it wants to develop its resources,” said Roger Diwan, an oil-focused vice president at energy consultancy  IHS Markit .</td>

      <td>The president calls the extra $80 billion for the agency an ‘investment.’</td>
      <td>Joe Biden may be mistaken about many things, but he’s right about the Internal Revenue Service. If the IRS is to become the agency he wants it to become, it needs the $80 billion in extra funding he is now proposing.<br />It comes down to the tax gap. This is the difference between what people owe the IRS and what it actually manages to collect. Though Commissioner Charles Rettig told the Senate Finance Committee in April that the IRS is leaving $1 trillion on the table each year, a more recent Treasury Department analysis put the gap at roughly $600 billion for 2019, which it said “is on pace to total $7 trillion over the course of the next decade.”<br />There are two schools of thought here. The first—call it the Joe Biden School—holds that the answer is to give the IRS the authority, funding and manpower it needs to go out and bring in that missing revenue. Accordingly, an $80 billion IRS infusion will more than pay for itself by generating an additional $700 billion in tax revenue over the next decade. It’s a bargain at the price.<br />The other school—let’s call it the Milton Friedman School—holds that the best tax collection system comes from a tax code that keeps taxes low, fair and simple. In either case, the kind of IRS you believe you need is more or less dictated by the tax code you prefer.<br />For Mr. Biden, the political appeal of a bigger and more aggressive IRS is obvious. It enables him to reassure ordinary Americans that none of the burden for all the trillions in new spending he wants will fall on them. Instead, it will all be borne by tax cheats and fat cats who aren’t paying their fair share.</td>

      <td>Actions against RCA, AT&T and Xerox gave a leg up to European and Japanese firms.</td>
      <td>When it comes to technology and the economy, the U.S. is grappling with two contradictory goals: competing with China in advanced technology industries and ramping up antitrust enforcement against leading U.S. tech companies.<br />Antimonopoly advocates argue that we can have our cake and eat it too. Go ahead and break up big tech, they say; we can still compete with China. But there is a long history of U.S. antitrust actions against technology companies, and the results suggest regulators should exercise caution.<br />Consider the case of Western Electric,  AT&T ’s  equipment subsidiary. By the early 1920s, it had factories in Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia and the U.K. But because AT&T relied on it exclusively for equipment, in 1925 the Justice Department threatened AT&T with breakup unless it divested Western Electric’s foreign assets, creating International Telephone & Telegraph and ultimately giving birth to robust foreign-owned competitors.<br />Antitrust regulators also pressured AT&T’s Bell Labs in the early 1950s to license its newly invented transistor technology. That spurred innovation because it helped emerging companies such as  Texas Instruments  and Fairchild. But because of government pressure, AT&T also licensed its technology, almost for free, to foreign companies. This eventually enabled  Sony  to take global leadership from the U.S. in consumer electronics, and it gave a major leg up to Europe’s Ericsson and  Siemens .<br />The U.S. also used to be the global leader in television technology thanks to the Radio Corp. of America, the pathbreaker in color television. But in the 1950s the Justice Department required RCA to let other U.S. companies use its patents at no charge. RCA had long relied on licensing revenue, so it started making money where it could—in Japan. “RCA licenses made Japanese color television possible,” technology historian James Abegglen has written.</td>

      <td>What the fall of empires, the rise of nations and the spread of diasporas have meant for Sunni Islam and Roman Catholicism.</td>
      <td>In July 1900, after a wave of attacks against civilians and politicians in Europe and America, an Italian anarchist who had been living in Paterson, N.J., murdered the king of Italy. In November 2015, Muslims from Molenbeek, Belgium (and elsewhere), killed 130 innocent people in Paris. In both cities, immigrant revolutionaries had pursued their global political agendas against the governments of their old and new homes alike. Faced with poverty, police surveillance and disproportionately high incarceration rates, some in these communities saw militancy as a legitimate form of politics and undertook several spectacular acts of international violence to advance their cause.<br />Pushing past an initial sense of cognitive dissonance, is it possible to think about these two bloody moments together? Today we have jarringly different perceptions of these two communities, but might we be willing to contemplate a fate for European Muslims similar to what has come to pass for American Catholics, one in which they have assimilated and also changed the civic and cultural life of their adopted countries? Joe Biden is the second Catholic president. Is it a bridge too far to contemplate a Muslim head of state in Belgium or France?<br />These are some of the knotty questions suggested by Jonathan Laurence, a professor of political science at Boston College, in his book “Coping With Defeat: Sunni Islam, Roman Catholicism, and the Modern State.” Mr. Laurence aims to shake us out of more somnolent ways of thinking about history and its place in current geopolitics. He succeeds in large measure due to his commitment to “systematic paired comparison,” which helps suspend lazy assumptions about the supposed inherent, eternal differences between Christianity and Islam.<br />Instead his refreshing, provocative work explores how the two largest religious planets in the political solar system adjusted to the birth of an entirely new celestial body—the state. Mr. Laurence argues that the displacement of religion by self-described secular states led to changes within the dominant religions—namely, the professionalization and institutionalization of Roman Catholicism and Sunni Islam. Political defeat produced new forms of spiritual authority—articulated and extended through the mechanisms of infrastructure, education and hierarchy—that the author terms “nation-state Islam” and “nation-state Catholicism.”<br />The story unfolds in three acts: the fall of empires, the rise of nations and the spread of diasporas. In each moment, Mr. Laurence offers a deeply researched analysis of how both religions counterpunched and adapted to their losses. Against its forfeitures of territory after Luther’s religious revolution and the political upheavals that followed, Catholicism’s Counter-Reformation expanded the number of dioceses around the globe, established Rome’s system of colleges, and created the Propaganda Fide, dedicated to evangelization. Nation-states took even more land and power from the church, eventually circumscribing direct papal sovereignty to the minuscule parcel of Vatican City. In the final period, Catholicism’s power manifested as almost exclusively spiritual and moral.</td>

      <td>With their ‘pretense of knowledge,’ BlackRock and Facebook make it harder to find the truth.</td>
      <td>The suppression of debate over the origin of the novel coronavirus highlights a broader problem. Governments were once the chief impediments to free speech and free markets, but extremely large private companies may have become the greater danger. These hyperscale firms serve as hubs and gateways in the highly networked knowledge economy. They are well-positioned to exert special control over information—and other companies.<br />China’s stalling and lying about Covid’s origins weren’t surprising. On the other hand, the behavior of U.S. officials and scientists was startling. They dissembled over their intimate knowledge of gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and their early suspicions the virus was “engineered.” But who expects politicians and bureaucrats to be honest and competent? That’s what an open society is for. Truth and accountability are the responsibility of a free press—and a free internet.<br />What happens when the press and the internet aren’t so free? Over the past year, YouTube,  Twitter  and  Facebook  joined with a partisan press to block and throttle discussion across a range of Covid-19 topics. They discouraged and erased talk of the Wuhan lab-leak hypothesis, cheap and safe generic treatments such as ivermectin, Sweden’s heterodox decision to stay mostly open, and the inefficacy (and cruelty) of school closures.<br />Social media even blocked access to three eminent epidemiologists—professors at Stanford, Harvard and Oxford Universities—who advocated “focused protection” of the vulnerable, which could have avoided the devastating economic and social costs of the overly broad lockdowns. A new National Bureau of Economic Research paper suggests lockdowns were a net negative for public health. In too many cases, independent-minded scientists and data analysts were right, while Big Public Health and Big Tech were wrong.<br />In his 1974 Nobel Prize lecture, Friedrich Hayek explained why this top-down “pretense of knowledge” is so dangerous. At the time Hayek was fighting socialists and Keynesians. The socialists thought governments should own and operate most industries and could allocate resources more efficiently and fairly than private firms. The Keynesians allowed more private control of business but thought they could fine-tune the economy with aggressive fiscal, monetary and regulatory policy.</td>

      <td>The data suggest prices will continue to increase, but the bank is guilty of faulty analysis.</td>
      <td>Economists routinely make mistakes in forecasting, and such mistakes are often forgiven. But recent errors by the Federal Reserve are deeper analytical blunders. As with any activity that claims to have professional status, economics must respect elementary arithmetic.<br />From May 2020 to May 2021 the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, or PCE, rose 3.9%, while the consumer-price index jumped 5%. The inflation outbreak has come as a shock to many economists. The latest numbers have undoubtedly required top officials and researchers at the Federal Reserve to revise their thinking.<br />The Fed considers the PCE index the most reliable indicator of price trends. The Federal Open Market Committee predicted in June 2020 that the increase in the PCE in the year to fourth quarter 2021 would be between 1.4% and 1.7%. At its June 2021 meeting the band was increased to between 3.1% and 3.5%, still too low. The 200-basis-point adjustment is the largest since the instability of the Great Recession more than a decade ago.<br />Now the Fed is saying that consumer inflation will be less than 3.5% by the end of the year, even as the underlying data tell a different story. Between the fourth quarter of 2020 (taking the average of three months) and May 2021, the PCE index increased 2.5%. In other words, the bulk of the 3.9% price increase has happened in 2021. So far in 2021 the typical monthly increase has been between 0.4% and 0.5%. If that trend continues unabated, the end-year numbers would be on the order of 5% or 6%.<br />The FOMC might still be right, but it’s clearly assuming that upward pressure on prices will weaken. Have such pressures been weakening or intensifying so far in 2021? What is the reality facing American business and finance? One way to assess the evidence is to check the results of business surveys. Among the most widely cited and well-regarded is the purchasing managers index from the Institute of Supply Management.</td>

      <td>LONDON—U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said England was on track to lift almost all Covid-19 restrictions as planned on July 19, even as the highly transmissible Delta variant of coronavirus drives a new surge in infections.<br />The move puts the U.K. in the vanguard of countries betting that vaccines will provide a durable route back to normalcy, despite the circulation of dangerous new variants. Mr. Johnson said the U.K.’s experience of Delta shows the shots have weakened, though not eliminated, the link between rising caseloads, swelling hospital numbers and spiraling deaths that characterized earlier stages of the pandemic.<br />He pitched the lifting of restrictions this month, already delayed once, as an end to government intervention and a revival of personal responsibility. Laws on social distancing, mask-wearing and other common features of the Covid-19 era are expected to be scrapped, he said, with the onus instead on individuals to make their own decisions about the appropriate steps to take to stay safe and protect others.<br />“This pandemic is far from over,” Mr. Johnson said at a news conference Monday, adding that the U.K. must reconcile itself to more Covid-19 deaths. But vaccines have changed the balance of risks between the burden of disease and the cost to the economy and society of continuing restrictions, he said.<br />“We must be honest with ourselves that if we can’t reopen our society in the next few weeks, when we will be helped by the arrival of summer and by the school holidays, then we must ask ourselves when will we be able to return to normal?”</td>

The Energy Ministry granted Pemex control of the development after the companies failed to reach an agreement.<br />Talos also questioned the assessment by a third-party firm that Pemex has just over half the likely reserves. The Zama oilfield, located in the southern Gulf of Mexico, straddles an area that includes a block won by the Talos-led consortium in a 2015 bidding round, and a block that Pemex was awarded in 2014 before the government began putting exploration blocks out to bid.<br />Mr. López Obrador, who opposed the opening to private investment made under his predecessor, put a freeze on new oil block auctions when he took office in late 2018.

Witness the unprecedented power grab engineered last week at the Federal Trade Commission by the new chair, Lina Khan.<br />The events didn’t get much attention because the press cares more about politics than governance. But on a series of 3-2 votes, the Democratic commissioners turned agency tradition upside down and gave themselves vast new powers to harass business.<br />The agency eliminated the long-standing role of the agency’s chief administrative law judge in presiding over fact-finding and rule-making. Now Ms. Khan, or someone of her choosing, will preside. The Democrats also killed the requirement that the FTC staff get a majority vote of the commission to start an investigation. Now only a single commissioner can sign off. Subpoenas can also fly at Ms. Khan’s discretion.<br />The commissioners rescinded the bipartisan Obama-era FTC statement, adopted in 2015, that the agency follow antitrust law as it has evolved in the courts. This is a sure signal that the three Democrats are planning to dump the consumer-welfare standard for antitrust that has prevailed for decades. Instead the agency will replace it with some new standard it hasn’t specified. Also on the chopping block is the “rule of reason” the Supreme Court has applied to antitrust law for more than a century.<br />This is the handiwork of Ms. Khan and Rohit Chopra, who is still a commissioner but has been nominated by Mr. Biden to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Ms. Khan is a 32-year-old academic who has no experience running anything. She helped write the October 2020 House Antitrust Subcommittee report on Big Tech and has called for breaking up large firms. Now she’s teeing up the FTC to stretch its powers in a way it hasn’t done since the 1970s and 1980s before it was rebuked by Congress and the courts.</td>

      <td>The suit is an all but certain loser in light of Brnovich v. DNC.</td>
      <td>Attorney General Merrick Garland is the front-runner so far for 2021’s bad timing prize. The Justice Department last month rushed out a lawsuit claiming that Georgia’s new election law violates Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act only days before the Supreme Court laid down standards that make the lawsuit a nearly certain loser.<br />Justice knew the likely timing of the Court’s ruling in Brnovich v. DNC, so a fair guess is that Mr. Garland succumbed to White House and progressive pressure to make a political statement to support Democratic efforts in Congress to federalize state election laws in H.R.1.<br />Bad call. Now federal judges hearing the case will have to contend with Justice Samuel Alito’s five principles in Brnovich as they assess the Georgia statute.<br />It won’t be easy to find legal fault under those principles. Mere voting inconvenience can’t be considered disqualifying, since all voting imposes some inconvenience. Any specific voting provision, such as the number of drop boxes, must also be considered in the overall context of a state’s voting rules. Georgia’s rules are generally lenient and don’t especially burden the ability of minorities to vote.<br />Perhaps Justice can find a federal judge somewhere to rule against Georgia, but such a ruling is unlikely to survive on appeal to higher courts. The legal and political result of the lawsuit is therefore likely to vindicate Georgia Republicans during the 2022 election season or leading up to 2024, depending on how the lawsuits proceed. Mr. Garland would be wise to drop the suit in light of Brnovich, lest his term at Justice be marred by the continuation of this patently political lawsuit.</td>

      <td>Columbus cut its income-tax rate while a judge upholds its right to do so.</td>
      <td>Ohio last week scored a double victory for taxpayers. Gov. Mike DeWine and the Legislature passed an income-tax cut that returns part of the state’s surplus to individuals and businesses. A legal victory also rolled back the Biden Administration’s attempt to seize control over state fiscal policy.<br />Federal Judge Douglas Cole on Thursday ruled in Ohio’s favor in its challenge to the American Rescue Plan Act, aka the March spending blowout. The law granted states $350 billion in aid but included a catch: The money could not be used to “either directly or indirectly offset a reduction in the net tax revenue.” The Biden Administration wants to steer funds to public employees instead of letting states cut taxes.<br />In blocking the tax-cut ban, Judge Cole criticized in particular the ambiguity of the mandate Washington placed on Ohio. The provision would let the Treasury Department challenge “essentially any reduction in the rate of any one or more state taxes,” he wrote, “even if other tax rates were increased.” His permanent injunction frees Columbus lawmakers from having to trade control over taxes for federal relief.<br />The judgment was well-timed, as the Legislature didn’t wait to put new tax cuts in place. On the same day as the ruling, Gov. DeWine signed the state’s 2021 budget, which lowers income-tax rates for all Ohio taxpayers. The reform eliminates the previous top rate of 4.8% on incomes above $221,000, and sets a new ceiling of 4% for all filers earning more than $111,000 a year. There are also rate cuts for each lower bracket.<br />Leaving more money in taxpayers’ hands makes sense amid a nationwide rebound in state tax revenue. Even without federal aid, states are benefiting from rising capital gains revenue from the housing and stock-market booms, as well as from recovering business sales. States such as New York and California are using the windfall to increase spending even more than they usually do, but Ohio is joining eight others that have cut taxes this year.</td>

      <td>An 1886 protectionist law gives Canada power over Alaskan tourism.</td>
      <td>When Canada in February temporarily banned cruise ships from its ports because of Covid-19, Alaska’s congressional delegation blasted the move. They said the decision threatened the Alaska cruise industry. What they didn’t mention is that the reason this industry is at the mercy of Canada is because of U.S. law.<br />That law is the 1886 Passenger Vessel Services Act (PVSA), a close cousin of the Jones Act, another barnacle on maritime trade and services. But while the Jones Act deals with cargo, the PVSA deals with passengers. It requires cruise vessels transporting people between U.S. ports to be American-flagged, American-built, American-owned and American-crewed. As the Alaska example shows, like all protectionism the law penalizes the very people it is intended to help.<br />“The PVSA is not America First,” said Utah’s Sen. Mike Lee on the Senate floor in April. “This is the encapsulation of Special Interests First. Or even, you might say, Canada First. Perhaps this is the reason that the Canadian government lobbies Congress to keep the PVSA in place.”<br />Canada likes the law because of a loophole that lets ships get around the PVSA so long as they stop at a foreign port in between their calls at U.S. ports. That means Canada for Alaskan cruise ships. So when Canada closed its ports, it effectively shut down the Alaska industry.<br />Tourism in general and cruise lines in particular are already reeling from the cancellations caused by Covid-19. An April report by Alaska’s government notes that the cruise industry accounts for $3 billion of the state’s economy. “The economies of many communities in Southeast Alaska,” it says, “are entirely dependent on tourism.”</td>

The DOJ alleged he committed fraud by using a corporate client’s information to make money for the bank at the client’s expense.<br />Propelling the case was an aggressive DOJ push, starting several years after the 2008 financial crisis, to pursue individual wrongdoing on Wall Street—a response in part to criticism from lawmakers and others that the government’ was too focused on extracting fines from banks without punishing people.<br />Sally Yates, who became deputy attorney general in 2015, formalized one of the strategies in a memo that year saying companies wouldn’t get full cooperation credit unless they turned over everything they knew about employees’ wrongdoing. Aiming for more lenient treatment for themselves, banks scoured their internal records for evidence of their own employees’ misconduct.</td>

      <td>An election-fraud rebuttal, a victory for integrity, and hopeful signs that voting patterns are changing.</td>
      <td>Democrats and the media have a simple rule about disputed elections: When Democrats complain about the result, there must have been something profoundly wrong with the process that rendered the outcome unreliable: dodgy ballots (Al Gore, Florida, 2000), corrupt machinery (John Kerry, Ohio, 2004), voter suppression (just about every election Democrats have lost in the south in the last 30 years but especially Stacey Abrams, Georgia, 2018).<br />When Republicans complain (Donald Trump, 2020), the challenge is an unconscionable threat to the foundations of our democracy, an assault on the sacred electoral process, a coup in plain sight.<br />So our consistent and principled defenders of election integrity face something of a conundrum in New York City after a Democratic mayoral primary election in a Democratic city has produced epic levels of electoral malarkey. All three leading Democratic candidates filed lawsuits last week raising the possibility of irregularities in counting and seeking legal relief in case the final result doesn’t go their way.<br />New York’s new ranked-choice voting system has combined with rank incompetence by the city’s Board of Elections to produce near total confusion about the result of the contest last month between Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president and former cop; Kathryn Garcia, the city’s former sanitation commissioner (who should know a thing or two about messy outcomes); and Maya Wiley, the far-left legal analyst for MSNBC.<br />One of them has to win, unfortunately, but we won’t know for a while the identity of the pol who will almost certainly be elected in November to succeed Bill de Blasio, a man for whom the term municipal disaster might have been invented.</td>

      <td>Its leaders warn of the threat from Beijing, but their budgets suggest otherwise.</td>
      <td>U.S. defense leaders have a problem: What they say doesn’t line up with what they do. The mismatch is apparent in the latest Pentagon budget, and a “say-do” gap undermines the trust of Congress and the American people.<br />Military leaders identify China as our No. 1 challenge, often calling Beijing “an increasingly capable strategic competitor,” as Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley has warned, or a “pacing” threat. Yet the budget request reduces the ability of the Navy and the Air Force—the services that would have outsize roles in any conflict in the Western Pacific—to respond to threats in that region. Meanwhile, the budget promises undeveloped weapons that may take decades to enter the fleet, funded by a “divest to invest” strategy.<br />The Navy wants to retire 15 ships, including seven guided-missile cruisers and four littoral combat ships, while procuring only two surface combatant ships and two submarines. (Congress’ budget draft would buy another destroyer and limit the retirements.) Naval aviation procurement dropped 15.6% over 2021 even as the Navy speeds up F/A-18 retirements. The USS Ronald Reagan, based in Japan to counter a threat from China, is overseeing the Afghanistan withdrawal in the Middle East because no other aircraft carrier is available. Meanwhile, China is building warships at an astonishing rate. In 2010 the U.S. Navy had 68 more ships than the Chinese navy. Today, it has 63 fewer, a swing of 131 ships in 10 years.<br />The Air Force is also following the Pentagon’s “divest to invest” lead. Combat aircraft procurement is down 22% from 2021. The force wants to retire 137 aircraft, more than double the number it plans to buy. After the retirement of 17 B-1s last year, the Air Force’s bomber inventory is at a level top officers have called the bare minimum. Ammunition procurement is down more than 40%. China in recent years has focused on procuring advanced aircraft and has the world’s third-largest air force. In addition, China has an extensive ground-based conventional missile force, including the DF-26, known as the “carrier killer” which is capable of striking Guam.<br />The defense budget tells the American people and allies that although we say China is a threat, we are not taking action to respond. Take Gen. Milley’s June 17 assessment of the threat that China will invade Taiwan: “I think the probability is probably low, in the immediate, near-term future.”</td>

At the time, the athlete posted a picture of himself on Instagram bare-chested leaning against the new car.<br />Bugatti nearly disappeared after World War II, when founder Ettore Bugatti died and the company entered a period of decline. The company ceased operations in 1952. It was bought in 1987 by Italian businessman Romano Artioli, who restored the company as a maker of limited edition sports cars. But Bugatti quickly fell on hard times again, ceased production and was bought by VW in 1998.<br />The late Ferdinand Piech, grandson of Beetle designer Ferdinand Porsche, pressed Bugatti to undertake the ambitious and controversial plan to build what became the Veyron. With a top speed of 254 mph, at the time of its launch in 2005 the Veyron was the fastest legal road car on the planet. The Veyron was succeeded by the Chiron, which sells for around $3 million.</td>

I’m referring to the bear markets that began in September 1939 and July 1998, according to a calendar maintained by Ned Davis Research. The former lasted nearly three years while the latter lasted less than two months.<br />At the beginning of that longest bear market, the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio, or CAPE—the one made famous by Yale University finance professor and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller that is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the trailing decade—stood at 16.45. That is below the CAPE ratio’s long-term average, suggesting an undervalued stock market.<br />At the beginning of the shortest bear market, in contrast, the CAPE ratio was more than twice as high, at 38.3. That reading was higher than all prior readings back to 1871, according to data from Prof. Shiller, suggesting a severely overvalued market. And yet the ensuing bear market lasted less than two months.</td>

      <td>A bidding war is brewing for property-rich grocery chain WM Morrison only a few months after Walmart’s partial exit from the British market</td>
      <td>Walmart  executives must be upset. Months after the retail giant sold a majority stake in its British grocery chain Asda at a mediocre valuation, U.K. supermarkets are suddenly hot property among private-equity firms.<br />A bidding war is brewing for Britain’s fourth-largest food retailer by market share, WM Morrison. On Saturday, the company’s management gave the thumbs-up to a £6.3 billion all-cash takeover proposal by  SoftBank Group -backed buyout firm Fortress Investment Group—equivalent to $8.7 billion at current exchange rates. But that probably isn’t the end: Private-equity giant  Apollo Global Management  said Monday that it might make a rival offer. Morrisons has already rejected a £5.5 billion offer from a third suitor, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.<br />The Fortress proposal represented a 42% premium to the grocer’s undisturbed share price. The stock is trading above this level in a sign that investors expect higher offers. Private-equity firms clearly think that years of intense competition and sterling’s poor performance since the Brexit referendum have left British supermarket stocks too cheap.<br />The Walmart sale may also have alerted them to the value of grocers’ real estate. Asda, the No. 3 U.K. player ahead of Morrisons, has been a lucrative purchase for new owners TDR Capital and the U.K.-based Issa brothers. Last week, they sold the supermarket’s network of warehouses and distribution centers to  Blackstone Group  in a £1.7 billion deal. Thanks to this property sale, Asda’s owners have already recouped the roughly £800 million of equity they put in, plus enough for a special dividend if they wish—less than five months after closing the deal.<br />Morrisons looks ripe for similar treatment as it owns roughly 85% of its stores. The supermarket’s property assets are valued at £5.8 billion on its books, but could fetch higher prices now. Grocery sales benefited from the pandemic as consumers cooked more meals at home. Some of the extra spending is likely to stick, with a knock-on effect on the underlying real estate, even as Britain’s social-distancing rules ease.</td>

Since then, the insurgents have seized most of the rest of Afghanistan’s border with Tajikistan.

We haven’t even changed the stamps. The reason is that we don’t want to create problems for businessmen, for traders, for common people.”</td>

Which Americans will raise their hands and pledge an oath to “support and defend” our Constitution if they’re taught it’s inherently racist?<br />The military requires unit cohesion, high morale, good order and discipline, and esprit de corps. After all, our troops face severe hardships during training, to say nothing of combat. Will we build or erode these key qualities of a strong fighting force if we teach young troops to see their battle buddies, as well as their sergeants and officers, first and foremost through the lens of race? I served in Iraq and Afghanistan alongside soldiers of every race and background. We saw each other as fellow Americans and fellow soldiers, prepared to lay down our lives for each other and our country if necessary.<br />Every minute of training spent on charlatans like Ibram X. Kendi at best is wasted time better devoted to tactical and operational excellence, but at worst and more likely is a corrosive blow to the intangible qualities needed to fight and win in war.<br />And that, let us recall, is the central mission of our military. If it ever fails, the consequences are not just, say, shareholder losses or more unemployable college graduates, but the eclipse of America by adversaries like Communist China. Those are the stakes. Our military should stick to real wars, not culture wars.</td>

Longtime Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg stepped down last week and was succeeded by Gary Nagle, who was previously a senior executive at the company.<br />Mr. Hayward will be succeeded at the end of the month by veteran mining executive Kalidas Madhavpeddi, Glencore said Monday.<br />Mr. Hayward oversaw Glencore’s response to a series of major international regulatory investigations that have bedeviled the commodities trading and mining group, putting pressure on its share price.</td>

      <td>Renewables subsidies, goals and mandates have undercut reliable baseload power generation.</td>
      <td>Regarding “Huge Winter Gas Bills Spark Anger, Action” (U.S. News, June 28): Renewables subsidies, goals and mandates have undercut reliable baseload power generation (primarily from hydrocarbons) and distorted the market. Consumers are overreliant on intermittent power-generation sources such as wind that sometimes aren’t there when we need them most. Meanwhile, most natural gas is sold based on monthly average price contracts, not spot price. Natural-gas producers saved tens of thousands of lives this winter, but they didn’t set prices or reap windfalls. Like farmers and ranchers, they take the price set by regional and global markets. The market signals were a vast and lengthy wind drought plus extreme demand for home heating and natural-gas power generation. The culprits behind this winter’s utility-bill price spike are supply and demand, a generational weather event and policy overreach in the name of climate virtue at consumers’ behest.<br />Brook A.

      <td>State wildlife programs are preferable to federal Endangered Species Act intervention, but a market solution is preferable to both.</td>
      <td>Relying on state biologists in the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (Wafwa) to protect the lesser prairie chicken hasn’t worked (“Biden’s Prairie Chicken Fillet,” Review & Outlook, June 23).<br />State wildlife programs are preferable to federal Endangered Species Act intervention, but a market solution is preferable to both. There is a market solution for the lesser prairie chicken, yet the state agencies quashed it. We as mitigation bankers paid a negotiated price to landowners with the most important habitat and secured more than half the habitat conservation goal in two years—eight ahead of schedule. Wafwa guessed at fair market prices, wasted a good deal of the money and made little progress toward its conservation goals.<br />The agencies relied on committees of biologists to make real-estate transactions requiring land and business expertise they don’t possess. Energy companies are now facing a total loss on the $60 million they contributed.<br />When it came time, the federal government did not have much choice on the ESA listing. The bird population is extremely low—only 5,000 lesser prairie chickens remain in eastern New Mexico and West Texas—and the Wafwa program has failed.<br />The way forward is to trust in conservation markets that pay private landowners market rates to restore and protect vital habitat. Our conservation banks have amassed nearly 100,000 acres of the last of the best land and we are ready to help.</td>

      <td>Supply is tight on the grid even before peak summer heat. Though genuine wear and tear could be the culprit, market manipulation isn’t out of the question.</td>
      <td>It isn’t even close to the peak of Texas’s sizzling summer season and already the state’s power grid has given out two warnings of tight conditions after a higher-than-usual volume of plants went offline. Wear and tear from the February winter storm is one possible explanation; market manipulation is another. They aren’t mutually exclusive.<br />Warm weather and low wind output played a role, but what was surprising about the alerts—one in April, the other in June—was the number of power plants that were offline at the same time. On June 14, the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas, the state’s grid operator, said some 11 gigawatts of generation (roughly 15% of that day’s peak load forecast and enough to power 2.2 million homes in the summer) was on forced outage for repairs. In April, Ercot had said roughly 33 GW of generation was out of service for maintenance. Of course, that isn’t entirely surprising after the February disaster that strained the entire system and left millions without power.<br />The exact causes of the outages aren’t all accounted for. Texas regulators on Wednesday ordered Ercot to release that kind of information within three days instead of the usual 60 days for any outages that occur this summer. Ercot is expected to release information on the June outages this week. While that will offer some color, it likely won’t be the full story, especially given that the information will be based on whatever the power plants have told Ercot. The independent market monitor, Potomac Economics, will investigate whether any market manipulation took place in those two events.<br />The tight supply conditions are a reminder of two separate but potentially compounding risks of a grid that offers large carrots in times of market tightness (up to $9,000 a megawatt-hour) but barely any sticks for being unavailable. Such a market gives generators little reason to maintain their power plants beyond the bare minimum, increasing the chances of unplanned outages. Secondly, in such a market, manipulation—withholding power from certain plants to reap outsize profits from others—is tempting. The combination seems to make for a potentially reinforcing spiral of risks, especially given the worn-down physical and financial state of power plants in Texas after the February storm.<br />The most obvious culprit for the outages is the storm itself, which left the grid severely strained. Beth Garza, former director of Ercot’s independent market monitor, pointed out that the June outages occurred on a Monday and that it isn’t uncommon for power plants to plan to go offline over the weekend for a quick fix only to have that outage extended because repairs took longer than expected.</td>

      <td>American political mood dictates a departure after nearly 20 years despite the myriad security and humanitarian risks</td>
      <td>The U.S. military hasn’t suffered a fatality in Afghanistan since February 2020—that is, for 16 months. So the tangible costs of staying in the country, at the reduced troop levels that had become the new normal, would have been relatively low.<br />Meantime, the intangible risks of leaving, on humanitarian as well as strategic grounds, are relatively high.<br />So what is it about the mood of America today that is compelling a departure?<br />The question is largely rhetorical at this point, because the departure is happening. The Pentagon said last week that the withdrawal will be completed by the end of August, a few weeks earlier than expected when President Biden said forces would be out by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that prompted the move into Afghanistan in the first place.<br />The departure impulse is bipartisan. Former President Donald Trump announced while he was still in office that all forces would be gone this year; Mr. Biden is following through.</td>

Ed Markey (D., Mass.), one of the authors of the House bill, said in a recent advocacy video. “We are in danger of making the same mistake.”<br />With narrower control of the House and Senate, more private-sector investment in clean energy, and a greater sense of urgency on climate change than in 2009, Democrats are taking a different tack in 2021.</td>

Coalition parties worked to find a compromise before the vote, which will likely take place late Monday.<br />Israel’s left-wing and Arab lawmakers, including many in the current government, say the law discriminates against the country’s Arab minority. The right-wing parties, including that of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, say the measure is needed to maintain security and preserve Israel’s Jewish character.<br />Opposition factions, including former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, are debating whether to back a law that they supported for years on security grounds, or oppose it to frustrate the new government.<br />Mr. Bennett on Monday accused the opposition of choosing political maneuvering over state security.</td>

Walter Kennedy flipping a coin, and the Suns earned the right to make the call when Kennedy chose a scrap of paper with their name on it.<br />They had strategized for this random act of chance by asking fans to vote for heads or tails, so they knew in advance what they would say as the phone line went silent and the commissioner flicked a half-dollar and the NBA’s future in the air.<br />The Suns called heads. It was tails. The Bucks got the pick and selected a player named Lew Alcindor, who would soon change his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.<br />It would take more than a half-century for the Suns and Bucks to meet again with so much at stake. But now they have gone from the league’s worst teams to the best, and they have found a better method of picking a winner than flipping a coin.</td>
