      <td>The NEA and AFT get behind progressive political indoctrination.</td>
      <td>Parents didn’t ask to be thrown into the trenches of America’s culture war, but progressives aren’t giving them a choice. Witness the way the national teachers unions are adopting woke values and pressing them into K-12 curriculums across the U.S.<br />The National Education Association, the largest teachers union, held its annual meeting last week and the measures approved by delegates deserve broader attention. One calls for the union to support and lead campaigns that “result in increasing the implementation of culturally responsive education, critical race theory, and ethnic (Native people, Asian, Black, Latin(o/a/x), Middle Eastern, North African, and Pacific Islander) Studies curriculum in pre- K-12 and higher education.”<br />Critical theory is a neo-Marxist ideology that is pervasive in higher education and teaches that a person is defined above all else by race, gender and sexual orientation, and that American institutions are designed to ensure white supremacy and “the patriarchy.”<br />The delegates also directed the NEA to lobby for “professional development around cultural responsiveness, implicit bias, anti-racism, trauma-informed practices, restorative justice practices and other racial justice trainings” for “all school employees.” The delegates called for similar training for students. Just what second-graders need: instruction on how to distrust kids with different skin colors.<br />Another delegate-approved measure calls for the union to issue a study criticizing “empire, white supremacy, anti-Blackness, anti-Indigeneity, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society.”</td>

      <td>New York’s presumptive next mayor beat the field by emphasizing crime.</td>
      <td>It took two weeks of counting, but former police captain Eric Adams has finally won New York’s Democratic mayoral primary. Perhaps the city that these days never sleeps safely has a chance to reverse its eight-year downward spiral under mayor Bill de Blasio.<br />The city Board of Elections late Tuesday showed Mr. Adams leading second-place finisher Kathryn Garcia 50.5% to 49.5% with fewer than 1% of votes outstanding. The Brooklyn borough president declared victory, and he wasted no time describing how his focus on crime set him apart from fellow Democrats.<br />“We have abandoned our cities,” Mr. Adams said Wednesday on CBS’s “This Morning,” when asked what lessons his victory might give to Democrats nationwide. “What’s happening in New York City is taking place in Chicago’s South Side. It’s taking place in California, in Atlanta. You’re seeing gun violence, and it’s so pervasive.” Mr. Adams pledged to put more officers on the street.<br />The primary wasn’t originally a single-issue contest. Then the rate of shootings, which started rising last summer, this May reached a 73% increase over 2020. An Ipsos poll that month found that crime had eclipsed the pandemic as voters’ top concern.<br />Mr. de Blasio gave voters a clear sense of the choice they faced by consistently denying the crime problem. He held a press conference Tuesday to celebrate a drop in shootings last month compared with June 2020, but he failed to mention that they remained 85% above June 2019. Mr. Adams has said that “denying what is happening in broad daylight is contributing to the problem.”</td>

      <td>An FBI raid in Beverly Hills tests the limits of civil forfeiture.</td>
      <td>When the FBI raided U.S. Private Vaults in Beverly Hills in March, it did so after the business had been indicted for conspiring to launder money, sell drugs and other crimes. But the FBI also took control of $86 million in cash and valuables it found in the safe deposit boxes of people who haven’t been accused of a crime. Some of these folks have sued, and two weeks ago federal Judge R. Gary Klausner granted a temporary restraining order preventing the FBI from taking permanent legal title of the seized contents of the plaintiffs’ boxes.<br />The Institute for Justice is representing seven plaintiffs in this case. Their argument is that they have done nothing wrong and should not have to go through the cumbersome civil forfeiture process to prove that their cash, jewelry or precious metals are legitimately theirs.<br />Judge Klausner seems to think they may have a case, taking aim at the FBI’s forfeiture notice. “This notice, put bluntly, provides no factual basis for the seizure of Plaintiffs’ property whatsoever,” the judge wrote in granting the restraining order.<br />U.S. Private Vaults is a private safe-deposit company that asks fewer questions than banks, and its boxes could be used to stash ill-gotten cash, drugs or other loot. Even so, the Fifth Amendment guarantees the right to due process before property can be taken.<br />Take Jeni Pearsons and Michael Storc, a married couple. She works at a nonprofit theater in Los Angeles, and he is a transportation coordinator in the film industry. In their box they kept $20,000 of silver they had saved over the years for retirement. Now the government wants to confiscate their silver—without saying what they did wrong.</td>

      <td>Another chapter closes in a two-century-long story of institutional failure.</td>
      <td>The assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse—in the wee hours Wednesday morning at the presidential residence in Port-au-Prince—is heartbreaking for the nation. I write this not because of any special affinity for Moïse. Rather, his bloody death, by a bullet to the head according to one source, marks the end of another failed chapter in Haitian institution building.<br />More than 200 years after slaves on the island of Hispaniola led a successful rebellion against French colonial government and proclaimed their liberty and independence, Haitians still aren’t free. The state is a predator and the rule of law remains elusive. A narrow cartel of special interests controls most of the economy. Haitians are desperately poor, yet Haitian immigrants to America have an impressive record of achievement. Given a level playing field, Haitians are more than capable.<br />Yet efforts to create the environment at home where honesty and hard work make social mobility possible are continually thwarted. This has led to a brain drain as those with the greatest natural talent and drive emigrate.<br />In the aftermath of the Duvalier dictatorships, which ended in 1986, political instability has been constant. The megalomanic Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who espoused liberation theology and violence against opponents, was removed in a military coup in 1991 but restored to power in 1994. He was elected again in 2001, then deposed and exiled in 2004. Drug trafficking and gang warfare flourished when his Fanmi Lavalas Party was in power and never went away. In recent years it has exploded.<br />Haitian elections were annulled in 2015, but in 2016 Moïse won the presidency in a do-over. The opposition argued that he was obliged to leave office in February 2021 under a ambiguous clause in the constitution that says that if elections are delayed, the president’s five-year term starts the year he is elected. Moïse took office in February 2017 and maintained that his five-year term should last until next February. But that was only a fraction of the controversy he generated.</td>

      <td>The Cold War is over, and Beijing is determined to amass an arsenal worthy of a superpower.</td>
      <td>New satellite images published recently reveal that China is building more than 100 new nuclear missile silos in its western desert. Many American arms-control proponents, including the researchers who made the discovery and the Washington Post editorial board, immediately blamed China’s actions on U.S. nuclear modernization plans and recommended that Washington make an arms-control deal with China to address this nuclear threat. This is both the wrong diagnosis and the wrong solution.<br />China is engaging in a massive nuclear-arms buildup as part of its broader strategy to challenge the U.S.-led rules-based international system, and the U.S. will need to respond by updating its nuclear program to defend itself and the free world.<br />For decades, China possessed a modest nuclear arsenal of a few hundred weapons. Unlike the U.S. and the Soviet Union, China never built a large nuclear arsenal during the Cold War, because the country’s nuclear doctrine promised never to use nuclear weapons first and called for a minimal force capable of retaliating against enemy attack.<br />U.S. defense strategists, however, long feared that China would eventually try to compete with the U.S. nuclear arsenal. They believed that as China became a geopolitical superpower, its leaders would eventually pursue a superpower nuclear arsenal.<br />That is exactly what we are seeing today. The new missile silos in the desert are part of a Chinese nuclear buildup that includes new submarines, bombers, and ballistic and hypersonic missiles. U.S. defense officials, including Commander of U.S. Strategic Command Charles A. Richard, have publicly testified that China’s nuclear arsenal will double, if not triple or quadruple, within the decade. This buildup could make China a nuclear peer with the U.S. and Russia, which each maintain no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear weapons, per New Start Treaty limits.</td>

      <td>Carmel-by-the-Sea, Calif.<br />An inside-page headline in the June 25 Carmel Pine Cone read, “Pine falls before tree service gets to it.” City forester Sara Davis told the paper that “the tree’s condition declined rapidly due to drought and an infestation of bark beetles.”<br />You could say local news is suffering a drought. We hear about it all the time with the closing of newspapers and the shrinking of staffs—for instance, the recent departure of 40 journalists at the Chicago Tribune following its sale to a hedge fund.<br />Weeklies like the Pine Cone are especially vulnerable. The journalism school at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill says some 2,000 weeklies—more than 1 in 5—have folded in the past 15 years.<br />Those who fret over the loss of local news usually focus on reporting about municipal government. But reading about the Carmel tree shifted my thoughts to little things that give a community its heartbeat. I called the Pine Cone’s editor, Paul Miller. He had an accomplished career as a news producer at CBS and NBC before buying the Pine Cone in 1997.</td>

      <td>Drugs and migrants, including trafficked children, continue to flow into Texas.</td>
      <td>What’s actually happening on the Texas-Mexico border?<br />There are two competing narratives. When she visited El Paso on June 25, Vice President Kamala Harris said “we have seen extreme progress over these last few months.” But touring the Rio Grande Valley five days later, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared “the Biden administration is completely failing” in securing America’s southern perimeter.<br />So which does the evidence support?<br />“Facts say the governor is right and make it difficult to figure out Ms. Harris’ definition of ‘extreme progress,’” says Kelly Hancock, Republican chairman of the state Senate Veterans Affairs and Border Security Committee chairman. Mr. Hancock was on Mr. Abbott’s tour and attended briefings by Col. Steven McGraw, Texas Department of Public Safety director, and Texas sheriffs.<br />Customs and Border Protection numbers support Mr. Hancock’s observation. As of May, there had been 271,927 encounters—detentions or arrests of people illegally entering the U.S.—in the Rio Grande Valley this fiscal year, up 172% over fiscal 2018 at the same point. Further west, the Laredo sector has seen 76,670 encounters, up 250% over the numbers this time in the 2018 fiscal year. In the Del Rio sector there have been 118,314 encounters—a jump of 1,067%. Even in El Paso, where Ms. Harris declared “extreme progress,” the fiscal year’s total was 113,824 encounters, or a 563% increase year over year.</td>

      <td>Succeeding in life by merit—and not because of background or parentage—seems eminently democratic. But the whole idea is under assault.</td>
      <td>In 1958, the British sociologist Michael Young published “The Rise of the Meritocracy,” a fictional narrative that imagined a world where leaders in business and government would be chosen on the basis of talent and effort rather than social status, wealth or power. But the book, which brought the word “meritocracy” into the English language, wasn’t written to celebrate such a world. To the contrary, it was intended as a warning that those who fell behind in the competition to get ahead were likely to resent the new elite and would eventually rebel.<br />As Adrian Wooldridge notes in “The Aristocracy of Talent: How Meritocracy Made the Modern World,” Young predicted that the rebellion would occur in 2034. But in the U.S. and Britain, it seems to have already begun. And while Young expected it to be driven by left-wing concerns over inequality and unfairness, the opposition to meritocracy now also includes forces on the political right who accuse the new elite of championing measures that benefit its own interests at the expense of the wider public’s. Britain’s vote to withdraw from the European Union and the election of Donald Trump in the United States are, in Mr. Wooldridge’s view, signs that many voters are no longer willing to defer to the judgments of supposed experts.<br />“The Aristocracy of Talent” is an effort to respond to this backlash. Although Mr. Wooldridge, an editor and columnist at the Economist, makes a strong case for the practical and moral value of meritocracy (while acknowledging its flaws), he doesn’t fully confront what might be its most disturbing challenge today: doubts about just what “merit” is or whether it even exists.<br />The idea of meritocracy is not new, of course. Mr. Wooldridge dates it to ancient Greece and Plato’s utopian vision of a governing class of carefully educated “philosopher-kings.” Imperial China developed an extensive “examination state,” he writes, to identify the most talented citizens throughout the country and bring them to the emperor’s court as “mandarins.” Liberal thinking about the rights of individuals and the oppressive character of the ancien régime helped fuel the spread of meritocracy in Europe after the Enlightenment. Rapidly in France and more gradually in Britain and elsewhere, confidence in the traditional, patronage-dispensing elites of landowners and nobles collapsed. This shift in outlook, as Mr. Wooldridge shows, led to reforms in schooling, government, business and the military.<br />It was in the United States, Mr. Wooldridge says, that meritocracy had the strongest appeal. In an 1813 letter to John Adams, Thomas Jefferson distinguished between two types of aristocracies: an artificial one “founded on wealth and birth” and a natural one rooted in “virtue and talents.” He argued that the Constitution enabled Americans to separate the two and enjoy the benefits of the second, the natural aristocracy, which was well suited to “the instruction, the trusts, and government of society.” With the important exception of race, the United States developed, in Mr. Wooldridge’s phrase, as “a republic of merit.”</td>

      <td>LONDON—For one fraction of a second, England’s major tournament fate seemed set to turn again on a missed penalty kick.<br />Generations of English soccer fans had seen this movie before. Their hero stepping up to shoot from 12 yards, the ball staying out of the net, and England getting knocked out. But on Wednesday night at Wembley, as Harry Kane watched Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel block his extra-time penalty, he delivered one more twist.<br />Kane buried the rebound to give his team a 2-1 lead after 104 minutes of play. And 15 minutes later, England had punched its ticket to its first major tournament final since the 1966 World Cup. The Three Lions will now meet Italy here on Sunday, in front of 60,000 supporters, for the chance to become European champions.<br />Until Wednesday night, England’s road back to a final had begun to look suspiciously clear. After 55 years of agony and heartbreak, everything was coming together at these Euros. Match after match, England performed and England advanced. The 4-0 victory over Ukraine in the quarterfinals was tense for about four minutes. Fans could be forgiven for wondering, was this what it was like to be Spain or France or Germany?<br />Denmark brought all the nightmares rushing back. After 30 minutes, 21-year-old Mikkel Damsgaard bent a free kick home and for the first time at this tournament, England was behind.</td>

Underwhelming economic data has added to those concerns, along with new data from Israel suggesting  Pfizer Inc . ’s vaccine is less effective at protecting against infections caused by the Delta variant.<br />On Wednesday, yields edged lower overnight before dropping steeply near the start of U.S. trading. They remained lower on the day after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its June 15-16 policy meeting, which showed officials discussed when the central bank might be able to start scaling back its monetary stimulus.<br />Investors and analysts this year have put forward very optimistic forecasts for economic growth and inflation, said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Société Générale. Now, she said, “The market is sort of taking a deep breath and saying, ‘Are those optimistic forecasts actually achievable?’”</td>

      <td>Lawyers for defunct startup’s former CEO say their defense to criminal-fraud charges is hampered because a database with millions of blood-test results was dismantled</td>
      <td>Lawyers for Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes asked a federal judge to place new restrictions on the scope of evidence that prosecutors can present at her coming criminal-fraud trial, arguing her defense is hampered by the loss of a database with millions of blood-test results.<br />During a virtual hearing, Ms. Holmes’s lawyers and the U.S. attorney’s office in Northern California continued months of finger-pointing over who is to blame for the inability to access the blood-test database. Called the Laboratory Information System, it recorded data points on millions of Theranos blood tests but became inaccessible in 2018 under circumstances the prosecution and defense disagree about.<br />Ms. Holmes’s lawyers argued that without the database, jurors shouldn’t be allowed to hear anecdotal evidence from patients who received inaccurate blood tests, or see a report from federal regulators finding deficiencies in Theranos’s labs in the years leading up to its 2018 collapse. The database would have given jurors a larger picture of the test results instead of anecdotes, and context around the regulator findings, the lawyers said.<br />Ms. Holmes is slated to go to trial Aug. 31 on charges that she defrauded investors and patients about Theranos’s technology and whether it was capable of accurately testing blood using proprietary devices that purported to need just a few drops of blood from a finger prick. As The Wall Street Journal first reported in 2015, many Theranos blood tests were actually run on commercial analyzers, including some that had been altered to work with diluted finger prick blood.<br />Ms. Holmes, who is due to have a baby this month, has pleaded not guilty.</td>

      <td>Democrats haven’t yet agreed on how much the package should cost; nor are they aligned on how much of it should be paid for</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden sought to rally public support for a multitrillion-dollar education and child-care plan at the core of his domestic-policy agenda, as Democrats in Congress wrestle with disagreements over the size and scope of the package.<br />“To truly win the 21st century and once again lead the world, to truly build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, to truly deal everybody in this time, we need to invest in our people,” Mr. Biden said at McHenry County College in Crystal Lake, Ill.<br />The president is simultaneously pressing Congress to pass a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and the education and child-care plan, which Democrats hope to approve without Republican support through a process tied to the budget known as reconciliation.<br />Both measures face challenges. The White House needs at least 10 Republican votes in the Senate to pass the infrastructure package, which was negotiated by a group of centrist senators. And Democrats must stick together if they want to move the education and child-care plan without the backing of Republicans. Democrats can lose no more than four Democratic votes in the House and none in the Senate on legislation opposed by all Republicans.<br />Mr. Biden pitched his plan in a county he lost in the 2020 election to former President Donald Trump, though Mr. Biden carried the state. The suburb north of Chicago is part of a congressional district represented by Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood, who ousted a GOP incumbent in 2018 and is now being targeted by Republicans hoping to reclaim the House majority next year.</td>

No date for a hearing has yet been set.<br />A British judge in January refused to grant a U.S. request to extradite Mr. Assange on the grounds that he would likely commit suicide if incarcerated in a federal maximum-security, or “Supermax,” prison and subjected to added security measures, such as solitary confinement, which are common pretrial arrangements in national-security cases.<br />The U.S. has given the U.K. a package of assurances that Mr. Assange won’t be held at ADX, a maximum-security federal penitentiary in Colorado, or subjected to extra security measures, according to the excerpts of the ruling, potentially removing a key impediment to his potential extradition.</td>

The lawsuits were filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Miami.<br />“We’re going to hold big tech accountable,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference.<br />The lawsuits named as defendants the chief executives of the three companies: Jack Dorsey of Twitter,  Alphabet Inc.’s  Sundar Pichai and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. Spokespeople for Twitter and Facebook declined to comment. A representative for Alphabet’s Google, which owns YouTube, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />Facebook on Jan. 7 imposed a ban lasting at least two weeks on Mr. Trump’s accounts on its flagship Facebook platform and Instagram in response to posts he made during the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his supporters the day before. Mr. Trump had repeatedly made false claims that he won the 2020 election and alleged widespread election fraud that was refuted by the administration’s top election security experts and attorneys. At the time, Facebook’s Mr. Zuckerberg said the risks of the president using the services during that period “are simply too great.”</td>

      <td>A federal judge ruled that the U.S. Air Force bears most of the responsibility for the 2017 mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, because it failed to enter the shooter’s criminal history into a federal background check database used for gun purchases.<br />The decision Wednesday from U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez of the Western District of Texas comes in a civil lawsuit brought by survivors and families of victims of the massacre at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, which left 26 people dead. The 26-year-old gunman, former Airman Devin Kelley, killed himself shortly after the attack, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history.<br />In his decision, Judge Rodriguez said the Air Force bore 60% of the responsibility for the shooting and ordered parties to set a trial plan within 15 days to assess monetary damages for the survivors and victims’ families in the case.<br />“The trial conclusively established that no other individual—not even Kelley’s own parents or partners—knew as much as the United States about the violence that Devin Kelley had threatened to commit and was capable of committing,” the judge wrote. “Moreover, the evidence shows that—had the Government done its job and properly reported Kelley’s information into the background check system—it is more likely than not that Kelley would have been deterred from carrying out the Church shooting.”<br />Kelley had been convicted in a 2012 general court-martial on two counts of domestic assault on his wife and their child and sentenced to a year in military jail, which should have barred him from legally buying a gun. But the Air Force never entered his conviction into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which gun dealers must use to check for criminal records before selling someone a firearm. As a result, after being thrown out of the military, Kelley was able to purchase a rifle at a gun store, which he later used in the Sutherland Springs shooting.</td>

Describing itself as “a museum and research center dedicated to advancing scholarship and public appreciation of postwar and contemporary Italian art in the United States,” Magazzino—“warehouse” in Italian—was founded by the collectors Nancy Olnick and Giorgio Spanu, her husband, to advocate for Italian artists from the beginning of Arte Povera (the couple’s initial passion) in the late 1960s to the present.<br />The well-proportioned galleries are housed in a purpose-built, sky-lighted building and a connected remodeled old industrial structure and surrounded by handsomely landscaped grounds. The 20,000-square-foot ensemble was designed by the Spanish architect Miguel Quismondo. Rotating exhibits of selections from the Olnick Spanu collection, organized by the museum’s director, Vittorio Calabrese, and his team, provide an opportunity to see, in depth, works by significant artists not often as well represented in American museums as their European reputations warrant.</td>

      <td>Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh star as sisters reunited in this emotional and action-packed addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</td>
      <td>If ever a superhero saga demanded—and deserved—to be taken on its own terms, “Black Widow” is the one.<br />A Marvel adventure that forgoes Marvel templates, it doesn’t pretend to be cosmic—no chance of a supervillain like Thanos turning the other half of the people on our planet to dust. It isn’t even epic, and certainly isn’t flawless. Much of the production plays like a conventional espionage thriller, though one with some action sequences of spectacular elegance. In the grand and intricate scheme of things it’s meant to serve mainly as a link between cycles of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and thus becomes the first of the new, post-“Avengers: Endgame” era. (“Black Widow” is playing in theaters and streaming on Disney+.)<br />Yet it’s an affecting link, a tribute to a fallen Avenger who died halfway through “Avengers: Endgame” in a startling act of self-sacrifice. Scarlett Johansson’s Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow figured importantly in several episodes, but did not have a movie of her own until this one, which was stylishly directed by the Australian filmmaker Cate Shortland (“Somersault”) from a screenplay by Eric Pearson. Not only does the film explore Natasha’s origins, it reconnects her after years of separation with her sister figure, Yelena Belova (sensational work by Florence Pugh, whose relatively brief career was already distinguished by standout performances in two films in 2019, “Little Women” and the horror tale “Midsommar”). And the flashbacking narrative addresses, with surprising subtlety, buoyant wit and fearless theatricality, several matters that superhero sagas aren’t supposed to trouble themselves about. What are childhood memories made of? What constitutes a family in which children can, or cannot, feel loved?<br />Those questions are framed by a preface, set in Ohio in 1995, that finds Natasha and Yelena—portrayed as sweet-spirited girls by, respectively, Ever Anderson and Violet McGraw—playing happily in lyrical slo-mo shots that might have been lifted from some Steven Spielberg vision of the American suburbs. But they are living in the bosom of a family that can’t be taken at face value. David Harbour is the face of the father and Russian supersoldier Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian. Rachel Weisz is the mother, Melina Vostokoff aka the Iron Maiden. It’s all fascinating, extremely strange and fatefully connected to a global program for KGB-trained assassins called Black Widows.<br />Two decades later Natasha is off the grid and on the run, a former Russian spy pursued by an assortment of shadowy adversaries who want her dead. Her death is far in the future, of course. “Black Widow” takes place before she became an Avenger, and gave her life for the sake of the supportive surrogate family she finally found. Still, our foreknowledge of her sacrifice deepens our feelings about present events, which include a family reunion under tumultuous circumstances, and both generations joining forces to destroy Dreykov (Ray Winstone), the monstrous head of the Red Room, where young women continue to be stripped of free will and turned into legions of Black Widows.</td>

      <td>From European runways to Manhattan sidewalks, the popularity of bicep-baring tank tops is surging. Here, why some guys are keen to show a little skin, and how to wear the sleeveless trend—if you dare.</td>
      <td>THIS IS SHAPING up to be the summer of skin in men’s fashion. During last month’s men’s runway presentations in Europe, Fendi showed skimpy, navel-flashing crop tops, and Prada sent out bare-chested models in barely there shorts. Outside the always-dramatic high-fashion sphere, young men with day jobs that are not modeling are also brandishing some skin. Thigh-highlighting 5-inch inseam shorts, a style perpetuated by users on TikTok, remain commonplace in urban enclaves. And this summer, the revealing male tank top—a longtime staple of men’s wardrobes—is surging with a new vitality.<br />“The sleeveless trend is definitely happening right now,” said Saisangeeth Daswani, who analyzes fashion and beauty trends at Stylus, a trend-forecasting agency in London. Ms. Daswani noted that for years, avant-garde designers like Riccardo Tisci, now at  Burberry ,  and Rick Owens have created body-conscious tanks, but the current tank onslaught is more of a grass-roots movement. During lockdowns, she said, many men were able to experiment with their style “in a more discreet way” from the comfort of their homes. This gave them confidence to sample daring clothes, like those bicep-baring tanks. As we return to our regularly scheduled lives this summer, these sudden risk-takers join the cohort of men already comfortable with showing their shoulders.<br />Adding to the tank top’s current appeal is what Clinton Chan, a 33-year-old engineer in Vancouver, called a “vanity aspect.” For men who spent every idle moment of quarantine ripping off push-ups and bicep curls, a tank top shows the fruits of their labor. It is no wonder that nearly every tank top fan I spoke with copped to spending ample hours working out. An extreme example of this muscular flexing can be seen in “F9,” the “Fast & Furious” franchise’s most recent box-office hit, in which beefcake Dom Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) wears a plethora of sleeveless shirts to flaunt upper arms the size of Christmas hams.<br />More modest sorts are layering fine, featherweight tanks beneath camp shirts or even sportcoats. Mr. Chan noted that to wear a tank solo you have to consider not just your physique but your body hair—another reason to treat the tank as a just-revealing-enough base layer—one that has the benefit of being far lighter in summer than a standard T-shirt.<br />Tanks make Joseph Corrao, 32, who works at his family’s restaurant in Little Falls, N.J., think of his grandfather, an impeccable dresser who often wore tanks beneath knit polos like a swank extra from Martin Scorsese’s 1995 film “Casino.” Taking a cue from his well-dressed elder, Mr. Corrao now wears tank tops so frequently, they’re “like a second skin.” He even recently sported one under a navy suit for a day in Manhattan.</td>

      <td>Federal Reserve officials suggested that they might need to pull back their support for the economy sooner than they had anticipated because of stronger-than-expected growth this year.<br />Fed officials discussing the matter at their June 15-16 policy meeting weren’t ready to reduce their $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage securities, according to minutes of the gathering released Wednesday. But an unspecified number thought that time could be approaching.<br />“Various participants mentioned that they expected the conditions for beginning to reduce the pace of asset purchases to be met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated at previous meetings in light of incoming data,” the minutes said. Others saw recent reports of weaker-than-expected hiring as reason to be patient in assessing their next moves.<br />The minutes offer a strong sign officials will ramp up more formal deliberations at their next meeting, July 27-28, over when and how to reduce the bond buying. Officials generally judged that, “as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments, including faster-than-anticipated progress” toward the Fed’s inflation and employment goals or risks of too much inflation.<br />The minutes showed officials still expect recent inflation surges to be temporary, driven primarily by bottlenecks and shortages stemming from the pandemic. But some officials raised concern that consumers’ and businesses’ expectations of future inflation “might rise to inappropriate levels if elevated inflation readings persisted,” the minutes said. Central bankers believe inflation expectations can be self-fulfilling.</td>

Her love interest is Martin Henderson’s Jack Sheridan, a former Marine struggling with PTSD who owns a local gathering spot called Jack’s Bar. The third season premieres Friday.<br />More than 3 billion minutes of the series’s 20 episodes were streamed in the first 10 days after the release of its second season, according to Nielsen, and it was the most-streamed program in its first full week of release on Nielsen’s list of most-streamed titles.</td>

Mr. Gevers’s organization, which is a volunteer-run security group, discovered the flaw.<br />“When we discovered the vulnerabilities in early April, it was evident to us that we could not let these vulnerabilities fall into the wrong hands,” Mr. Gevers said in a blog post. “After some deliberation, we decided that informing the vendor and awaiting the delivery of a patch was the right thing to do.”<br />Kaseya declined to comment on the timeline but said that Mr. Gevers’s organization “has been a great partner and we value the service they provide.”<br />The flaw reported by the Dutch group was one of seven vulnerabilities the group reported to Kaseya concerning its software, Mr. Gevers said. Kaseya has said multiple flaws were chained together in the attack, but it wasn’t clear exactly how the attack was carried out or the extent to which all the flaws were used.</td>

      <td>F.H. Buckley argues that flaws in a law are seen more clearly in hindsight than foresight, so “Conservatives Should Oppose the Filibuster” (op-ed, June 28). He’d like a procedure that would allow a repeal of a law with 51 instead of 60 Senate votes.<br />No doubt experience helps unearth error, but Mr. Buckley ignores the ease with which the filibuster can stop bad legislation and the difficulty of repealing a bad law with a filibuster-free Senate. With the filibuster Republicans can block a bill with 41 senators, which they have had at all times since 1979 except for about six months in 2009. To repeal a bad law in a filibuster-free Senate, they would need control of the House, the Senate and the presidency, which they didn’t have from 1955 until 2003, and have had for only about six years since then. While waiting for this happy trifecta, a bad law can do a lot of damage, and it may have spawned supporting constituencies that make repeal more difficult.<br />Jim Dueholm<br />Washington<br />Mr. Buckley’s idea is great in theory but won’t work in practice. “It is easier to identify bad laws with the benefit of hindsight,” he writes, but reasonable people can disagree about which laws are bad. A law that is bad for me might be good for you. The passage of any law also creates parties with a vested interest in maintaining it and resisting repeal.</td>

      <td>When a U.S. President draws a clear red line, he has to enforce it.</td>
      <td>Barack Obama’s misadventures in Syria showed that a President shouldn’t draw red lines he isn’t willing to enforce. President Biden hasn’t been afraid to talk tough and set expectations with Vladimir Putin, but will Mr. Biden enforce his own red lines?<br />Media reports suggest that the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service, was behind a recent cyber attack on a Republican National Committee contractor. The same outfit hit the Democratic National Committee six years ago and was behind the more recent SolarWinds attack on U.S. government agencies and corporations. The RNC attack took place last week, around the same time as a Russian-linked gang struck hundreds of American businesses with ransomware.<br />Mr. Putin has spent his time in power invading neighbors, meddling in Western elections, cheating on arms-control agreements—and allowing cyber attacks against the U.S. This despite the best efforts to improve relations from George W. Bush, Mr. Obama and Donald Trump. Mr. Biden’s team argued that last month’s summit wouldn’t solve a problem like Mr. Putin but could limit the damage. The new cyberattacks suggest this was wrong.<br />Mr. Biden has said he gave Mr. Putin a list of 16 critical infrastructure areas that should be “off-limits” from cyber attacks. He warned after the meeting that “if, in fact, they violate these basic norms, we will respond with cyber.” The President suggested over the weekend that the U.S. would respond if it found the Kremlin at fault over the recent attacks.<br />Mr. Putin is not omniscient and his grip on Russia isn’t as firm as it sometimes seems. But he was—or should have been—aware of an attack on a major political target in the U.S. If Russian hackers are independent of the government, Moscow should be willing to cooperate with Washington and bring them to justice. Note that these cyber-criminals in Russia never seem to attack targets in Russia.</td>

      <td>SINGAPORE—Deaths in Indonesia from Covid-19 rose sharply on Wednesday, with reported daily fatalities nearly double the number from two days ago, as the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus overwhelms the largely unvaccinated country’s healthcare system.<br />Public-health experts have for weeks warned that Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous nation, could face a surge like the one that caused India’s hospital system to collapse in April and May. Around 5% of Indonesia’s 270 million people are fully vaccinated and infections have been rising for days. The country reported a record 1,040 deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, up from 558 deaths two days ago.<br />Hospitals in many parts of the archipelago have run out of beds and ventilators. Fears of oxygen scarcity have led authorities to import supplies from abroad. Hundreds of healthcare workers who were fully inoculated with shots developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd.—which make up the bulk of Indonesia’s current vaccine supply—are infected with Covid-19, reducing the medical manpower available to deal with the flow of patients, doctors’ associations say.<br />“Now we are in a very severe situation,” said Dicky Budiman, an Indonesian epidemiologist at Griffith University in Australia, adding that cases were likely to rise further in the coming days.<br />Doctors and volunteers say many people are dying in their homes without being tested for Covid-19 and that reported cases and deaths don’t accurately reflect the scale of Indonesia’s crisis. The country reported 34,000 new infections on Wednesday, its highest single-day tally. Authorities have said the Delta variant is circulating widely and is dominant in parts of the country.</td>

      <td>It appeals to progressives because it allows them to vote twice—once for show and once for real.</td>
      <td>When it comes to counting votes, America’s political parties want to keep or gain their own advantage. The public interest, however, demands a nonpartisan method. No neutral method has yet been devised that merely elicits the people’s will without twisting it one way or another. Ranked-choice voting is an attempt that has its own twist and will make elections worse for both parties.<br />The idea isn’t new but it has gained favor, mostly from the left. It can be dismissed as too complicated and, coming as it does from professors, too demanding for most voters outside New York City. But I would like to present three deeper faults in it that concern how voters think, for ranked-choice voting is intended to make them think in a certain way.<br />First, by ranking choices a voter is required to divide his vote between a favorite candidate and some merely acceptable ones. The first choice is what the voter privately wills—the representative who suits him best. This choice is not directed at the common good, which requires that voters consider what others want. In a free country voters should desire a common good superior to the wishes of private individuals to prevail.<br />Ranked-choice voting makes the common good inferior to each person’s private first choice. The common good of the country typically gets ranked second choice or below for each citizen.<br />Ranked-choice suffuses the spirit of systems where multiple parties vie to build coalitions after votes are cast. In the U.S., parties aspire to gain majorities through the voting rather than by secret, chancy negotiation afterward. Each looks for ways to bring together difficult companions: Republicans must reconcile the interests of evangelical Christians and libertarians; Democrats must balance the desires of progressives and moderates. Ranked-choice voting splits these coalitions and requires the pieces be brought together after the election, and not by voters. In presidential elections, the Electoral College produces a majority intended to recognize the importance of the states, one that sometimes differs from a popular majority. But in any case it is a coalition majority.</td>

      <td>We may be stuck with inflation above 2%—maybe even above 3%—for a while.</td>
      <td>If you’re worried about a return to the double-digit inflation of the 1970s and ’80s, relax. There is a lot of angst these days as a result of the stunning 5% inflation rate (for the year ending May 2021) in the last consumer-price index release. We haven’t seen a reading that high in 13 years, but the huge supply shocks of the double-digit days aren’t present, and the Federal Reserve won’t let inflation soar. It is certainly possible, however, that inflation will linger above the Fed’s 2% target for a while.<br />Two different measures of inflation command attention. Most people focus on the CPI, which reached an eye-popping 5% last month. Financial markets pay more attention to something called the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, because the Fed’s inflation target is 2% for the PCE.<br />Does it matter? Yes. For one thing, CPI inflation typically runs higher than PCE inflation. The historical average gap between the two is 0.4% per annum, but there are times when it is much larger—such as today, when the 5% headline CPI figure corresponds to only 3.9% PCE inflation.<br />While 3.9% is better than 5%, it is still far above the Fed’s 2% target. Although Fed officials are playing down the recent inflationary surge as transitory, inflation worrywarts aren’t convinced.<br />One reason is that inflation, once it gets high, is hard to get back down. Normally that is true. But current inflation spikes are driven by special transitory factors. We’ve seen the rise—the 12-month PCE inflation rate leapt from 1.2% to 3.9% in five months—but as these transitory factors dissipate, the decline will likely come.</td>

Among the trains that will be replaced are venerable Amfleet cars that have carried passengers in the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C., and Boston—and on routes across the national network—for more than 40 years.<br />The order will include two types of dual-powered locomotives intended to improve environmental efficiency and cut down on travel times on some routes. Battery hybrid locomotives—diesel locomotives coupled with a battery car to allow for periods of all-electric power—will run on some state-sponsored routes, including in and out of New York’s Penn Station, the railroad said.<br />The battery-hybrid locomotives will be the first of their kind in use in the U.S., an Amtrak spokesman said.</td>

MGM’s share of box office receipts is tiny and Amazon’s entertainment footprint is relatively small.<br />But Amazon of course does much more than make movies: it is the country’s largest e-commerce and cloud-computing company, and a dominant seller of books, videos and music. Founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post. In their totality, then, Amazon and Mr. Bezos represent a significant concentration of economic and cultural influence. For a new generation of trustbusters, that’s a bigger concern than the efficiency benefits a merger might bring.<br />“There is sound reason to ask whether permitting Amazon to leverage its platform to integrate across business lines hands it undue economic and political power,” then law student Lina Khan wrote in a now famous law journal article in 2017.<br />Last month, President Biden named the 32-year-old Ms. Khan chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission. At a confirmation hearing in April, she said antitrust’s historical role is to “protect our economy and our democracy from unchecked monopoly power.”<br />Ms. Khan embodies the neo-Brandeisian movement, named for Louis Brandeis, a crusading lawyer and later Supreme Court justice who argued bigness was both inefficient and antithetical to liberty. “Size, we are told, is not a crime,” he wrote in 1914. “But size may, at least, become noxious by reason of the means through which it was attained or the uses to which it is put.”</td>

      <td>With the economic recovery under way, how much debt companies owe in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis is a crucial indicator for investors—if only they could agree on how to measure it.<br />Total borrowing by companies around the world rose by a modest 1% in the first half of 2021, after jumping to an all-time high of $13.5 trillion last year, according to data published Wednesday by investment firm Janus Henderson. On the surface, this looks like the start of a typical period of deleveraging after a debt binge.<br />But it isn’t so simple: While companies have raised a lot of cash, they haven’t spent it. In the U.S., government support has allowed them to accumulate even more liquid assets than debt, meaning their “net debt” levels haven’t gone up much, Federal Reserve figures show. The same seems to have happened all around the world, including in emerging markets.<br />As companies start spending their war chests during the second half of 2021, analysts at Janus Henderson forecast that net debt, rather than falling, will rise by as much as $600 billion this year. In their view, it should be a favorable environment for junk bonds, even though they now yield less than 4 percentage points more than safe debt—close to the pre-2008 low. Some of the big firms that lost their investment-grade credit rating, such as Kraft Heinz and Nordstrom, are on their way to rehabilitation.<br />Pessimists will instead see mounting net debt as yet another sign of irrational exuberance, to be added to the surge in house prices, proliferation of blank-check investment vehicles, and roller coaster trading in “meme stocks” and cryptocurrencies.</td>

Some of these staffing challenges are likely just near-term, while others, such as a shortage of pilots that existed before the pandemic, threaten to pose challenges in coming years.<br />Southwest Airlines Co.  and  American Airlines Group Inc.,  two of the hardest-hit by cancellations and delays last month, took steps to stabilize their operations ahead of the busy July 4 weekend. Southwest offered flight attendants and ground staff double pay to work extra shifts over the holiday period. American trimmed back schedules to build in room for recovery from potential hiccups.<br />The efforts appear to have helped. Thunderstorms roiled flight schedules last week, prompting hundreds of cancellations and thousands of delays. But weather improved over the weekend and airline operations were smoother, airline officials said.<br />Carriers faces another test this week as Tropical Storm Elsa reaches the south Florida airports that have been among the most popular travel destinations this summer.

The No. 1 song is “Butter,” an effervescent single by BTS, K-Pop’s biggest band, that has ruled the chart for six straight weeks. Also in the top four are rapper-singer Doja Cat’s “Kiss Me More,” featuring R&B singer SZA, at No. 3, and U.K. pop star Dua Lipa’s “Levitating,” featuring rapper DaBaby, at No. 4.  The one non-dance-pop track is  Disney  star and singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo’s “Good 4 U,” which is No. 2.<br />It’s too early to say which song or songs will dominate the season. The “song of the summer” accolade also isn’t what it used to be, experts say. That is because over the past decade, music listening has become highly fragmented, with some consumers turning on the radio, others relying on streaming playlists and still others buying CDs from big-box retailers like Target or paying more attention to live shows. With everyone in their niches, it’s harder for one song to feel ubiquitous.<br />But if there’s a well-known barometer, it’s Billboard’s Songs of the Summer chart, which began in 2010. On its most recent edition, BTS’ “Butter” ranked No. 1, followed by Olivia Rodrigo’s “Good 4 U,” Dua Lipa’s “Levitating” and Doja Cat’s “Kiss Me More.”<br />Like its disco-influenced predecessor “Dynamite,” which hit No. 1 last year, BTS’ “Butter” is an English-language song—part of a continuing bid by the seven-member South Korean boy-band to dominate the globe. One of the co-writers and co-producers of the track, which contains the lyric “hot like summer,” is Columbia Records head Ron Perry, an ally of BTS’ label who helped launch Lil Nas X and—earlier in his own career—worked with Lorde and The Weeknd.</td>

Another cites a 2015 magazine article that said Beyond Meat would never be able to turn pea protein into a convincing substitute for steak or chicken.<br />“You have to hold on to that, take that negative energy and use that to fuel you,” Mr. Brown argues.<br />The 49-year-old founded Beyond Meat in 2009 after quitting a career in alternative energy.

Beyond now has its sights set on poultry, after recently testing a plant-based version with KFC.<br />The pandemic’s blow to the food-service industry hurt Beyond’s business, contributing to four straight quarters of losses and spurring it to ramp up its supermarket presence. And some products haven’t panned out, including Dunkin’ Brands’ late-2019 nationwide launch of a Beyond breakfast-sausage sandwich, which the doughnut chain recently scaled back to several hundred restaurants.</td>

First lady Martine Moïse was also shot and hospitalized, Mr. Joseph said.<br />The motive for the killing isn’t clear. Haiti has been in increasing turmoil in the past few months, partly over a disagreement over when Mr. Moïse’s term ended. The president, elected in 2016, was due to step down in February, but said his term lasted another year. The opposition accused him of a power grab. Mr. Moïse was also pushing for a rewrite of Haiti’s constitution to allow the president to run for a second term and have more control over the armed forces. New presidential elections are scheduled for September.<br />The gunmen haven’t yet been identified. Mr. Joseph said some of the gunmen were speaking Spanish, and later suggested in interviews that the assailants may have been foreign mercenaries.<br />It means greater political uncertainty, likely violence, and economic decline in what is already the hemisphere’s poorest and least stable country.</td>

      <td>The European supermajor gave a preview of a bumper second quarter for oil and gas companies, but the energy transition clouds the bigger picture</td>
      <td>The recovering oil price has taken one boot off the neck of  Royal Dutch Shell .  The second boot from the energy transition remains firmly in place.<br />On Wednesday, Europe’s largest oil major by market value reported strong second-quarter operational results and said it would increase its shareholder returns. It will pay out between 20% and 30% of cash flow from operations for the second quarter.<br />The change fulfills a promise to boost returns once net debt fell below $65 billion. Working capital movements mean Shell’s quarter-end net debt may have missed the target—investors will have to wait until later this month for a precise number—but that hasn’t rattled investors: The stock rose in early trading. The company continues to rebuild shareholder trust after last year’s surprise dividend cut, which was Shell’s first since World War II.<br />One risk to the current optimism is the inherent unpredictability of the oil market. While demand is recovering and inventories are falling for now, much uncertainty remains.<br />Covid-19 variants are the wild card on the demand side. As for supply, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have shown remarkable discipline over the past year, but cracks are now appearing. If OPEC+ fails to find a deal, there is a risk that members could open the taps and send prices plunging.</td>

      <td>KABUL—The Taliban attacked the capital of Afghanistan’s northwestern province of Badghis, enabling more than 200 inmates of a local prison to escape, as the insurgent group expanded its recent offensive against government forces.<br />Abdul Aziz Bek, the provincial council chief in Badghis, said senior officials, including the deputy police chief, and more than 100 troops surrendered to the Taliban and handed over their weapons in the province’s capital city of Qala-e-Naw Tuesday night. “It is a frightening moment in the city,” he said.<br />Amid the fighting, guards abandoned the provincial prison, some 200 yards away from the Badghis governor’s office, Mr. Bek said, and the inmates broke the gate and escaped. Footage released by the Taliban showed scores of prisoners streaming from the facility and chanting “Allahu akbar.”<br />Skirmishes continued throughout Qala-e-Naw on Wednesday. All the districts of the province around the city already are under Taliban control, according to local officials, with the remaining three falling earlier this week. The Taliban launched a sweeping offensive across Afghanistan last month, taking advantage of the U.S. military withdrawal, but so far haven't fully seized any provincial capital city.<br />Taliban negotiators at peace talks with the Afghan government in Doha, Qatar, say they are not seeking to take provincial capitals by force. In addition to the Doha talks, senior representatives of the Taliban and Afghan politicians, including a senior adviser to President Ashraf Ghani, gathered Wednesday for negotiations hosted by the Iranian government in Tehran.</td>

      <td>Progressives including Sen. Bernie Sanders seek to empower Medicare to negotiate prices; some centrists are working with Republicans to reach narrower deal</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats are debating whether to fold an effort to cut drug prices—by allowing Medicare to negotiate—into a budget package or try to pass the measure on its own.<br />Both parties have prioritized lowering prescription-drug prices for years, but haven’t been able to pass a bipartisan agreement. Many Democrats now see a budget package, which could clear the evenly divided Senate with just a simple majority, as their best shot at overhauling the system.<br />But intraparty divisions over policy issues could complicate that path, and some lawmakers are advocating for making more modest changes with GOP support. Democrats can lose no more than four votes in the House and none in the Senate on legislation opposed by all Republicans.<br />“I want something that passes with bipartisan support and the country needs a win here,” said Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a centrist Democrat who said he was working with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on a narrower agreement. Mr. Schrader said he met recently with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), who has long been involved in the issue.<br />Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) has said he hopes to include provisions allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for certain costly drugs in Medicare in a sprawling package Democrats plan to advance through a process tied to the budget, known as reconciliation. Mr. Sanders said he hopes to use savings from that to expand Medicare benefits to include dental, vision and hearing and lower the eligibility age to 60 from 65.</td>

      <td>A professional rider is attempting a do-it-himself race through the mountains and onto Paris. Is this a model for the future of sports?</td>
      <td>The Australian cyclist Lachlan Morton is amid a throwback Tour de France—an old-school version of the race in which he rides alone, repairs his own bike, seeks out his own food, and pretty much fends for himself all the way around the countryside to Paris.<br />Morton’s professional cycling team, EF Education-Nippo, calls Morton’s feat the “Alt Tour,” and the ride, which is also raising money for World Bicycle Relief (a charity that donates bikes to communities in need), is a celebration of the Tour’s early, do-it-yourself, slightly-unhinged roots. Morton’s got himself a flashy Cannondale bike and plush Rapha threads, but the creature comforts pretty much stop there. The other night, as his EF teammates in the actual Tour de France slept in a quiet hotel, Morton tossed and turned in a sleeping bag because a rave was thumpathumpthumping nearby.<br />The Journal’s Joshua Robinson wrote about Morton’s race as it started, and as the cyclist approaches two weeks in the saddle, it’s clear the endeavor is capturing the imaginations of race fans. I think it’s potentially bigger than that. It’s possible that they’ll be talking one day about Lachlan’s ride in business schools, as an example of how a modern sports operation can widen its ambitions and grow its audience.<br />I know that sounds a bit cuckoo. But here’s my case (look at me, a sports hack writing a biz column in The Wall Street Journal!):<br />This is where the sport is heading. Like a lot of sports, cycling finds itself (pun intended) at a crossroads. The sport’s traditional structure feels stagnant—while glam events like the Tour will always get attention and snazzy stars like Tadej Pogacar and Mark Cavendish, much of the consumer energy in cycling is heading over to the “adventure” category, as riders both amateur and professional seek out challenges a bit more exotic than finishing first on a paved road. This shift has been under way for a while, but it surged during the pandemic, which eliminated much of the race calendar and triggered a bike boom in which cyclists turned to socially distant riding. Some of it is also a byproduct of safety, as cyclists fed up with distracted drivers are turning to off-road riding to reduce risk.</td>

      <td>U.A.E. wants to pump more, now, so it can invest in diversification before oil demand diminishes</td>
      <td>Behind the standoff inside OPEC over whether to boost oil production is a key cartel member with a new strategy: sell as much crude as possible before demand dries up.<br />The United Arab Emirates’s strategy, as described by officials familiar with the matter, represents one of the most significant shifts in oil policy by a major Mideast petrostate. For years, the region’s oil-producing governments have said they aren’t worried about finding crude buyers far into the future. The U.A.E., which holds some of the world’s largest untapped crude reserves, is breaking from that orthodoxy, according to people familiar with the strategy.<br />“This is the time to maximize the value of the country’s hydrocarbon resources, while they have value,” said a person briefed on the U.A.E.’s strategy. “The aim of the investment is to generate revenue for the diversification of the economy, both for investment in new energy and, as importantly, in new revenue streams.”<br />The country isn’t worried about a sudden drop in demand, and expects to have buyers for its crude for decades. However, people familiar with the new tack say the country wants to pump and sell as much as it can now, when demand and prices are strong. Proceeds will help it wean its economy off oil.<br />“Market share is a key factor here,” said a senior U.A.E. oil executive. “We want a bigger market share, to monetize as much as we can from our reserves, especially when we have spent billions developing them.”</td>

It is seeking to stay in the black after years of losses from burning cash to win customers.<br />Didi reported a quarterly profit of about $800 million in the first three months of this year, most of that because of its market dominance and concentration in China. That commercial strength may now weigh on its prospects as the company comes under regulatory scrutiny at home, analysts say.<br />On Sunday, the country’s internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China, ordered mobile app stores to remove Didi’s China app. Two days earlier, the same regulator launched a cybersecurity review of the company. Didi didn’t respond to a request for comment on the impact of the move on its business.<br />More than 90% of Didi’s first-quarter revenue came from ride-hailing in China, according to its listing prospectus. Rival  Uber Technologies Inc.’s  core ride business, by contrast, accounted for just 29% of its first-quarter revenue; food delivery brought in 60%.</td>

Data from Dartmouth Prof. Kenneth French shows that the link between moves in the two groups—the correlation of the daily changes over 12 months—is the weakest since at least 1926.<br />In some ways, it isn’t exactly a surprise to find that weird stuff is going on. After all, we have just lived through the steepest economic decline and rebound in history, and the first-ever enforced shutdown of the economy by the government.<br />Yet such a breakdown of the normal connections between stocks is a sign that something is wrong, even after the market appears to have fully recovered from the Covid-19 crash of March 2020.</td>

That makes it the third-largest hub for such companies in the Asia-Pacific region, after the far more populous China and India.<br />In March, local e-commerce giant  Coupang Inc .  went public in New York. It had a market value of about $69 billion as of Tuesday,  according to FactSet. Videogame developer Krafton Inc. is gearing up for an initial public offering in August that it says could be one of Seoul’s largest ever, with a maximum size of 4.3 trillion won, the equivalent of about $3.8 billion.<br />The rise of these stand-alone businesses is notable in an economy long dominated by sprawling family-owned conglomerates. These groups, known as chaebols, have produced some of South Korea’s most notable tech businesses, such as  Samsung Electronics Co .  and  SK Hynix Inc . , which are heavyweights in areas such as smartphones and semiconductors.<br />Bankers, investors and entrepreneurs say a few characteristics have helped South Korean startups thrive. The country has an affluent, tech-savvy population that is mostly squeezed into a few big cities, where superfast mobile broadband is widespread. South Korea has a population of roughly 52 million, or slightly larger than Texas and Florida combined.</td>

      <td>Online ad titans will benefit from easy comparisons in second quarter, but the ongoing rollout of Apple’s iOS could still hit results</td>
      <td>Second-quarter results coming up in a few weeks from ad giants  Facebook  and Google parent Alphabet could suggest the bark of  Apple ’s  iOS privacy changes was worse than their bite. But investors shouldn’t get too comfortable: The bulk of the impact is likely still to come.<br />In April, Apple released an updated version of its operating system, which now requires apps to ask for users’ permission to track their activities once they leave the apps. For ad platforms, off-app tracking has historically helped to show advertisers an enhanced return on their investment. Most users don’t immediately buy a product when they see an ad for the first time on a platform; many take weeks, viewing multiple iterations of an ad, to finally convert. When they do buy, they often do it directly via a brand’s website.<br />Though Apple’s new operating system will have been around for the bulk of the second quarter, its early effects on ad giants might look muted for several reasons. First, last year’s second quarter saw the heaviest effects of the pandemic as many advertisers temporarily pulled funds amid global uncertainty. Facebook and Google boosted sales an average of just over 4% year-over-year in that period of 2020, making for a favorable comparison this year.<br />Second, adoption of Apple’s latest operating system is still very much under way. By the end of June, around half of Apple smartphones and tablets globally had yet to update to one of the two latest iOS 14 versions, which both include the ad-tracking limitations, according to Statcounter.<br />Third, it seems many advertisers have pre-emptively shifted their budgets to focus more on targeting Android, rather than iPhone users. From early February to early May, the mix of global ad spending on Android rose from roughly 60% to over 68%, according to marketing analytics firm Singular. Moves to target users with more lenient privacy policies may be helping ad platforms to recoup lost revenue from users who opted out of ad targeting on iPhones, analysts say.</td>

      <td>The practice provided 81% of the online brokerage’s first-quarter revenue</td>
      <td>Robinhood Markets Inc. is on a collision course with regulators over a controversial practice that generates most of its revenue, as the online brokerage gears up for a highly anticipated initial public offering.<br />In its IPO filing, released Thursday, Robinhood disclosed that 81% of its first-quarter revenue came from sending its customers’ stock, options and cryptocurrency orders to high-speed trading firms—a practice known as payment for order flow.<br />Payment for order flow, or PFOF, makes it possible for Robinhood to let customers place trades with no upfront commission payment. Zero-commission stock trades helped the company win over millions of younger, less affluent customers and are now standard practice at many of Robinhood’s competitors.<br />Payment for order flow critics—including the country’s top market regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler—are wary of the practice. They argue that it poses a conflict of interest for brokerages, because the brokers can either collect more money for selling their customers’ order flow or pass that money on to customers in the form of price savings on their trades. Last month, Mr. Gensler said the SEC was reviewing payment for order flow, fueling speculation among some market observers that PFOF could be banned.<br />“The entire business model of some brokers is in the crosshairs,” said Tyler Gellasch, executive director of Healthy Markets Association, an investor trade group.</td>

The SCA didn’t immediately provide details of the agreement.<br />In a nod to how the ship’s grounding and eventual seizure by Egyptian authorities caught the world’s attention, the SCA held a ceremony to mark the ship’s departure from the port in Ismailia that was attended by foreign diplomats and broadcast live on Egyptian TV.<br />The ship blocked the Suez Canal for nearly a week in March before being dislodged from its banks. The SCA had demanded payment for the costs of the rescue operation, damages to the canal’s banks and lost revenues. An Egyptian court, which had ordered the seizure of the ship after authorities initially claimed about $900 million in compensation, allowed its release on Tuesday.<br />A preliminary deal was struck late last month between the owner and insurers of the Ever Given and the SCA called for about $200 million in compensation, according to people familiar with the deal. But Egyptian media has said the amount is much higher and the deal also includes a tug boat. The shipowner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd. of Japan, the ship’s charterer, Taiwan’s  Evergreen Marine Corp. , and its technical manager, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, declined to comment on the deal’s terms at the time.</td>

Its economic, political and social woes have deepened, with gang violence spiking heavily in the capital of Port-au-Prince, inflation spiraling and food and fuel becoming scarcer at times in a country where 60% of the population makes less than $2 a day. These troubles come as Haiti still tries to recover from the devastating 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew that struck in 2016.<br />Mr. Moïse, 53 years old, had been ruling by decree for more than two years after the country failed to hold elections, which led to Parliament being dissolved. Opposition leaders have accused him of seeking to increase his power, including approving a decree that limited the powers of a court that audits government contracts and another that created an intelligence agency that answers only to the president.</td>

      <td>The money-transfer fintech hit a market value of more than $11 billion, outpacing market expectations and giving a boost to the London tech scene</td>
      <td>Wise PLC’s shares made a strong trading debut in London Wednesday, as investors bet on the online money-transfer service’s ability to win business from established banks.<br />The U.K.-based fintech, formerly known as TransferWise, started trading with a market valuation exceeding £8 billion, equivalent to around $11 billion. That compares with market expectations of $6 billion to $7 billion ahead of the anticipated public listing, according to a person familiar with the matter. Wise didn’t disclose a targeted valuation. Wise traded at £8.10 a share.<br />Founded a decade ago, the company aims to make transferring money across borders easier and less expensive. It has grown revenue in each of its last three fiscal years and tripled profit over that period to £30.9 million.<br />The listing underscores the strong appetite among investors for new stock market entrants. IPOs globally raised a total of $331 billion in the first six months of 2021, more than four times $75 billion raised in the year ago period, according to Dealogic. London, in particular, saw volumes surge almost $14 billion from $668 million over the same period.<br />Write to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com and Simon Clark at simon.clark@wsj.com</td>

      <td>Surging electricity use and higher natural-gas prices are giving coal new life despite its environmental drawbacks</td>
      <td>Coal use is surging in some of the world’s largest economies as electricity demand rebounds from the pandemic, illustrating the challenges to countries looking to wean themselves off the dirty but reliable fossil fuel.<br />Coal was in decline for years in many countries, but its use is now picking up in the U.S., China and Europe despite growing pressure from governments, investors and environmentalists to curb carbon emissions. The leading reason for the uptick—which has pushed coal prices to multiyear highs—is rising power demand as economies reopen rapidly from pandemic hibernation.<br />While analysts and executives say the resurgence of coal is likely to be short-lived, it shows the world’s continued dependence on fossil fuels until renewable-energy capacity grows further and storage technologies improve.<br />Countries have spent billions adding renewable-power capacity at record rates, but solar and wind projects generate electricity only when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, and can’t be ramped up when demand rises. Those limitations mean the world is still reliant on fossil fuels, especially when there is a surge in electricity demand. Analysts say this will remain the case until more renewable capacity is added, along with storage such as batteries.<br />“It’s difficult to get off coal because of security of supply. At the end of the day you need to keep the lights on,” said Kathryn Porter, founder of energy consulting firm Watt-Logic. “When governments are faced with the choice of not supplying electricity, or using coal, they will use coal.”</td>

Some individual stocks have done even better. Spain’s  Banco de Sabadell SA,  which was hammered during the pandemic’s shutdowns, is up 60% in 2021, while French banking giant  Société Générale SA  is up nearly 50%.<br />“European banks have really surprised on the upside,” said Tom Kinmonth, a fixed-income strategist at Dutch bank ABN AMRO. He said a big reason was that loans in the region hadn’t turned sour in droves as was feared.<br />The rebound began in November, after news of successful vaccine developments started emerging. An improvement in the region’s economic outlook and the easing of a dividend ban for banks gave a further boost.<br />Tom O’Hara, a Janus Henderson portfolio manager, said price moves were also being driven by international investors dipping back into the sector after years away. These investors are looking to diversify from U.S. and technology stocks and prepare for rising inflation, which would trigger interest-rate increases that could be good for banks.</td>

They could help doctors rapidly test for and treat the unusual clotting, arising from an immune-driven mix of coagulation and loss of platelets that stop bleeding.<br />The Canadian study analyzed blood samples from AstraZeneca vaccine recipients and builds on recent research done in Europe and elsewhere into the infrequent blood clots linked to the vaccine. Health officials are monitoring the rare side effects balanced with the vaccines’ proven value in fighting Covid-19. The blood clotting, which some scientists have named vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, or VITT, has also been linked to  Johnson & Johnson’s  Covid-19 shot, though incidents have occurred less frequently with that shot than with AstraZeneca.<br />Though rare, the condition has proven deadly in more than 170 adults post-vaccination in the U.K., Europe and U.S., according to government tallies. Many were younger adults who appeared healthy before vaccination, researchers and drug regulators say.<br />The companies have said they are undertaking further research to understand the issues and believe the vaccines’ benefits outweigh the risks. Health and government officials have said that the benefits of both vaccines generally outweigh their risks but recommend warnings about the potential risks.</td>

      <td>Chinese electric-vehicle maker  XPeng Inc.  made its debut on Hong Kong’s stock exchange on Wednesday, wrapping up a listing that brings it closer to investors in China and offers it insurance against the risk of being kicked off U.S. markets.<br />XPeng, which competes with  Tesla Inc.  and homegrown rivals such as  NIO Inc.  and  Li Auto Inc.,  raised the equivalent of $1.8 billion by selling shares in Hong Kong. Ten months ago in its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, XPeng raised $1.5 billion.<br />Unlike numerous U.S. listed Chinese companies, such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and  NetEase Inc.,  which have sold shares through secondary listings in Hong Kong since late 2019, XPeng opted for what is known as a dual-primary listing. That means it has to follow Hong Kong disclosure and corporate governance standards more closely.<br />That choice allowed XPeng to list in Hong Kong more quickly than if it had done a secondary listing and could give it greater weight in the city’s share indexes. The dual-primary listing also makes XPeng eligible for Stock Connect, a trading link with mainland China.<br />The setup means XPeng’s listing status in Hong Kong will be independent of what happens in the U.S., said Brian Gu, the company’s president and vice chairman. “In the event of sudden disruption to our U.S. listing and trading status, our shares can continue to trade in Hong Kong without any interruption,” he said.</td>

It is emblematic of the struggle roiling platforms from Facebook Inc. to  Twitter Inc.,  which soared to prominence by encouraging people to share information but which now face regulatory and social pressure to police divisive, misleading and dangerous content without censoring diverse points of view.<br />For YouTube, it also shows gaps in its efforts to steer users to videos that should be of interest based on viewership patterns, as opposed to those that are going viral for other reasons.<br />In the study, one of the largest of its kind, 37,000 volunteers used a browser extension that tracked their YouTube usage over a 10-month period ended in May. When a participant flagged a video as problematic, the extension was able to track whether it was recommended to the viewer or whether the person found it independently. The videos flagged by participants as objectionable included a sexualized parody of “Toy Story” and an election video falsely suggesting  Microsoft Corp.  founder Bill Gates hired students involved with Black Lives Matter to count ballots in battleground states.</td>

A spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms-trade association, said it plans to challenge the law in court.<br />The actions come as shootings in several of the state’s cities have increased from prior years. A recent poll found voters were more concerned about crime than education, and Mr. Cuomo said the perceived lack of safety could prevent the return of office workers to Manhattan and other urban centers.</td>

      <td>The President wants the cartel to pump more oil, but the U.S. to pump less.</td>
      <td>As cognitive dissonance goes, this is a classic. President Biden’s explicit policy goal is to reduce U.S. oil and gas production, limiting the global supply of fossil fuels in the name of fighting climate change. Yet his Administration is now imploring the OPEC oil cartel to pump more oil so U.S. gasoline prices don’t rise more than they already have on Mr. Biden’s watch.<br />Oil prices climbed to a six-year high on Tuesday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia failed to agree on increasing production quotas. Last spring OPEC slashed production quotas after crude prices plunged to $20 per barrel amid economic lockdowns and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.<br />But energy demand has snapped back in much of the world as Covid-19 vaccines roll out, governments ease lockdowns, and freight shipments surge. U.S. petroleum consumption is now roughly where it was at this time in 2019. OPEC estimates that oil demand in industrialized countries will increase by 2.7 million barrels a day this year.<br />In early June OPEC modestly raised production quotas, but demand is still rebounding faster than supply. The upshot is that crude prices are averaging around $74 a barrel, up 45% or so this year. OPEC countries naturally want to take advantage of the pandemic recovery to boost production and generate more petrodollars to fund their governments.<br />But a squabble between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over quotas is blocking an agreement, sending U.S. gasoline prices to a near seven-year high. Enter the Biden Administration. A White House spokesperson on Monday said it is urging OPEC and its allies to quickly come up with a compromise “that will allow proposed production increases to move forward.”</td>

The Pentagon needs to upgrade its technology for managing data, which range from reconnaissance mission readings to information about its more than 2.8 million employees, which are siloed among thousands of networks and centers.<br />Enter JEDI, which aimed to give the Pentagon a centralized “secure cloud environment” and allow it to “rapidly access computing and storage capacity to address warfighting challenges at the speed of relevance.”<br />Amazon was considered the frontrunner, but Trump Defense Secretary Mark Esper delayed the decision after some in Congress and  Oracle  complained that a former Defense official who had worked at Amazon steered the procurement to the company. President Trump also called for an investigation of the contract, but a Pentagon probe concluded the conflict didn’t affect the JEDI decision.<br />But after Defense handed the contract to Microsoft, Amazon alleged in a lawsuit that the contract was tainted by Mr. Trump’s animus against then CEO Jeff Bezos. The Pentagon denied that Mr. Trump influenced the procurement, but the litigation threatened to delay the contract for years.</td>

      <td>American shareholders get an expensive lesson in Xi Jinping risk.</td>
      <td>American investors buy shares in Chinese companies because they want to take bigger risks in exchange for bigger potential returns, and it looks like their wish is Beijing’s command. Witness how Chinese regulators have tanked the stock in ride-hailing firm  Didi Global Inc.  barely a week after the company raised $4.4 billion in a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.<br />The trouble started within days of last Wednesday’s listing, when Chinese regulators ordered Didi—the Chinese version of Uber and  Lyft —to stop accepting new customers and, later that weekend, told app stores to remove the app for download. The moves threatened the growth potential investors found so exciting. Beijing’s Cyberspace Administration, which issued these diktats, cited concerns about the security of user data.<br />Now Didi has become embroiled in what may turn into a broader Beijing crackdown on Chinese companies issuing shares abroad. The State Council on Tuesday said it would tighten oversight of companies listing overseas, particularly with regard to their use and storage of customer data. Beijing, which runs an increasingly extensive surveillance state, isn’t worried about its citizens’ privacy. Rather, it probably wants to make sure foreigners can’t access the same data that it can.<br />Two other recent U.S. listings,  Full Truck Alliance Co.  and  Kanzhun Ltd. , also are in the crosshairs over ostensible data concerns after raising a combined $2.5 billion in their public offerings last month. Didi’s shares fell more than 20% Tuesday, closing well below its IPO price of $14.<br />Most of this counts as business as usual in China, as investors should have known. Didi’s prospectus disclosed that executives from Didi and at least 30 other internet companies in April were hauled in for a meeting with Beijing regulators, where they were told to conduct “self-inspections” for compliance with antitrust, tax and other laws. The company warned it could only assume its self-criticism, er, inspection had been sufficient.</td>

      <td>Fresh off its largely successful efforts to keep millions of American kids out of classrooms for a year, the National Education Association is striking another blow against the nation’s education.<br />Many readers may view the country’s largest teachers union as a highly politicized and partisan activist group. It’s hard to argue the point when consulting the lobbying and campaign finance data on the website of OpenSecrets.org. Of the millions of dollars categorized as “independent expenditures” by NEA or affiliates in 2020, every single nickel went to supporting activities described by OpenSecrets as either “Against Republicans” or “For Democrats.”<br />But the union is not just favoring Democrats—it’s pushing them leftward. At its recent convention, the NEA adopted a resolution containing a to-do list that could have been drafted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.). The first objective listed in the policy reads:<br />The document goes on to note that “we oppose attempts to ban critical race theory and/or The 1619 Project” and also pledges to join “with Black Lives Matter at School and the Zinn Education Project” to call for “a national day of action to teach lessons about structural racism and oppression.”<br />This column has noted the number of prominent historians flagging significant historical errors in the 1619 project. Christopher Rufo recently wrote in these pages making the case against critical race theory.</td>

      <td>The French President’s green virtue signaling could cost him his job.</td>
      <td>President Emmanuel Macron’s climate-change amendment to the French constitution effectively died this week. Its failure is the latest example in Western democracies of the disconnect between elites obsessed with climate change and the public.<br />Mr. Macron wanted a national referendum that would amend the constitution to “guarantee” environmental protection. This requires support from both houses of the French Parliament. The National Assembly, controlled by Mr. Macron’s party, approved the referendum this year.<br />The Senate announced Monday that it had voted to block the process. The upper body, with a conservative majority, worried that “guarantee” meant climate change would come before other constitutional imperatives. They feared, not unreasonably, that this would stifle innovation and business. While many in France cling to its statist past, there is still a constituency for economic dynamism.<br />This isn’t the first time Mr. Macron’s obsession with climate has wasted valuable time and political capital. Although the yellow-vest protests covered sundry domestic woes, they began as a response to a fuel-tax hike. The demonstrations led Mr. Macron to form the Citizens Convention for Climate, a body of 150 randomly selected French citizens. They came up with the climate amendment, which Mr. Macron wasted months fighting for.<br />The real shame is that Mr. Macron’s growth agenda would do more for the environment than punishing rural drivers or fiddling with the constitution. A more innovation-oriented French economy would produce companies and technology that solve environmental problems.</td>

Customers texted their delivery orders for heroin and cocaine to what was known as the Candyshop Number, which sold only to customers who had referrals, according to prosecutors.</td>

      <td>The woke are angry, humorless, and—worst of all—vindictive. Surrender is not an option.</td>
      <td>I happened to mention the phrase “culture war” in a 1996 conversation with Irving Kristol, who was a contributor to these pages and always a penetrating observer of contemporary American life. “The culture war is over,” Irving said, then paused and added: “We lost.” Alive today, Irving would have been sadly reaffirmed in his declaration, surprised perhaps only at the extent of the loss and the cost it has entailed.<br />His “we” would include those people who believe in the rewards owed to effort and merit, the value of tradition, and the crucial significance of liberty. “We” would distinctly not include those who believe in the importance of spreading “diversity,” “inclusion” and “equity” as conceived by present-day universities. Nor would it include those whose sense of virtue derives from their putative hunger for social justice and their willingness to make severe judgments of others based on lapses from political correctness. These people are “they,” the woke, who have, as Kristol had it, won the culture war.<br />The extent of the woke victory is perhaps best demonstrated by the long list of cultural institutions they have captured and now control. Two of the country’s important newspapers, the  New York Times  and the Washington Post, are unashamedly woke. The New Yorker and the Atlantic have ceased to be general-interest magazines and are now specific-interest publications—that interest being the spread of woke ideas. The major television networks early fell in line without a fight.<br />Universities, in their humanities and social-sciences divisions, are not merely devoted to the propagation of woke ideas but initiate most of them. In turning away from the ideals of authority and objectivity in favor of clearly partisan views, these institutions have lost their former prestige yet are apparently sustained by the confidence that preaching woke doctrine is a higher calling.<br />Under the deep division in the country, certain prizes—Pulitzers, MacArthur grants, honorary degrees—go almost exclusively to people whose views are woke. (Presidential medals—in the humanities, in the arts, for freedom—are dictated by whether the president in office is woke or not.) Under political correctness, one of the main planks in the woke platform, freedom in the arts is vastly curtailed owing to strictures against what is known as “appropriation,” which disapproves of whites writing about blacks, men about women, heterosexuals about homosexuals. Under woke culture, art is vastly inhibited; humor, because so much of comedy is politically incorrect, largely excluded.</td>

      <td>The justices upheld our common-sense election laws against baseless charges of racism.</td>
      <td>Protecting the right to vote while maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the results is every public servant’s sacred duty. With that in mind, I defended Arizona’s election safeguards before the Supreme Court in March. Last week, in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, the justices ruled 6-3 in our favor, reaffirming the ability of states to administer secure elections with outcomes every voter can trust.<br />The Democratic National Committee asked the court in 2016 to strike down Arizona’s statutes on in-precinct voting and ballot harvesting as violations of the Voting Rights Act. The DNC didn’t have a sound or compelling argument, so it lapsed into calling Arizona “racist” for passing the law. I am thankful the justices saw through this partisan attack and upheld our common-sense measures. The court’s ruling is a win for election integrity at a time when the far left conducts propaganda campaigns to trick people into believing any election law that protects against voter fraud is “Jim Crow 2.0.”<br />The irony is that the DNC chose to attack Arizona, a state that offers some of the most convenient ways to vote. You can vote early in-person, vote on Election Day, or request a no-excuse absentee ballot. Don’t want to get out of the car? We also have drive-through ballot drop-off sites. Contrast that with other jurisdictions such as Delaware, Connecticut and New York, which require bureaucrats to approve your reason for absentee voting. Why are those requirements not being challenged? It’s clear that the DNC prefers to pursue its partisan power plays in what it deems to be battleground states.<br />In 2016 the Arizona Legislature established new guidelines restricting who can collect and deliver another person’s ballot, a practice that has become known as “ballot harvesting.” Ballot harvesting often exploits vulnerable communities when third parties not only gather and claim to deliver all ballots, but also “assist” people in filling them out. This opens the door and rolls out the carpet for anyone who may be attempting to commit voter fraud or intimidation.<br />Arizona’s Legislature passed ballot-harvesting protections in 2016 after the city of Phoenix warned of unauthorized people going door-to-door to collect early ballots while purporting to be city election officials. Civil-rights leaders—including Michael Johnson, who previously served on Phoenix City Council, and the Arizona Latino Republican Association for Tucson Chapter—raised concerns about elderly and vulnerable communities being targeted by ballot-harvesting activists. With the common-sense guidelines that are now law, only a family or household member, caregiver, mail carrier or elections official is authorized to deliver your ballot. That provides acceptable levels of ballot security, convenience and peace of mind that we should all be able to agree on.</td>

      <td>Democratic congressional leaders threaten to scuttle it unless they get a partisan spending bill.</td>
      <td>‘There ain’t gonna be no bipartisan bill unless we’re going to have a reconciliation bill,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said recently. Translation: Democrats won’t reach across party lines to pass infrastructure legislation unless they pass another spending bill with no Republican support.<br />I worked closely with Mrs. Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for decades. They’re both great people and skilled legislative tacticians, and they apparently think this strategy is the only way to hold their fragile majorities together and give all Democrats at least some of what they want.<br />I hope they rethink their strategy. President Biden has agreed to an infrastructure proposal with a bipartisan Senate group and the House Problem Solvers Caucus. Linking it to a separate multitrillion-dollar partisan reconciliation bill would likely end with passage of neither. The American people wouldn’t soon forgive this failure, and they’d blame Mr. Biden and Democrats because we’re in the majority.<br />That risk became clearer last week when Mr. Biden went to Wisconsin to advocate for the bipartisan agreement, which would be the largest federal infrastructure investment since the creation of the Interstate Highway System 65 years ago. The president said the plan would create millions of good jobs and ensure America can compete with China. It would replace 100% of the lead water pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 school across America, repair roads and bridges, upgrade the power grid, close the digital divide, make U.S. coastlines more resilient against climate change, and entail the largest investment in public transit in American history.<br />In other words, the president’s essential message in Wisconsin was that this is a historic plan every American should be very excited about, while the message from Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer in Washington is that we can’t have this infrastructure plan until Congress is done debating and voting for a separate, controversial, costly bill that may or may not pass months from now.</td>

      <td>Western European leaders see less threat from China and Russia than U.S. and Eastern European ones do.</td>
      <td>President Biden is reviving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—or is he? With President Trump gone, the alliance is back to business as usual, and Mr. Biden has emphasized members’ “sacred obligation” under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which governs how members respond to an attack on a fellow member. But a military alliance needs a military. Without a clear pathway to European rearmament, NATO won’t be able to respond to a crisis.<br />“The money is there to rebuild the allied militaries,” a European colleague observes. “The problem is the politics of it.” Translation: Genuine rearmament across the alliance would signal that Europe is ready to take military action alongside the U.S. and could put European access to Russian oil or Chinese markets at risk. If European NATO allies began to show real exercised military capabilities, it would signal to Moscow and Beijing that NATO is willing to ensure deterrence in Europe holds, freeing the bulk of American military power for the Indo-Pacific.<br />This clearly isn’t going to happen soon. Vladimir Putin’s seizure of Crimea in 2014 and the war in eastern Ukraine demarcate a polarization of NATO members. On one side, Poland, Romania and the Baltic states see Russia as a clear and present danger, determined to expand its portion of the post-Cold War settlement. On the other side is a very cautious Western Europe, wary of endangering economic growth over the well-being of their formerly Soviet-dominated neighbors. Berlin seems intent on managing rather than opposing Russia through a mix of political and economic engagement.<br />Looking farther abroad, while Washington sees China as both a military and economic problem, Europe considers it a strategic challenge but also an economic opportunity. The Asian market is seen as too critical to Europe’s prosperity to risk angering Beijing. Germany is deeply invested in Asian markets, and staking a clear position on the brewing Sino-American conflict isn’t in its interest. France’s security priorities are focused southward, toward the Mediterranean and Africa, not eastward. These disparate interests across Europe make a NATO-wide consensus on threats hard to achieve.<br />Some observers look back fondly on the Cold War, when NATO members’ goals were tightly aligned. That time has passed. U.S. power has been depleted by globalization and deindustrialization, decades of war in Afghanistan and the Middle East, and political polarization at home. As American global leadership falters, Europe has been increasingly adrift as it tries—somewhat awkwardly—to weigh its options. Russia has exploited these fissures while China has transformed itself into a power in Europe by investing in European technology companies.</td>

      <td>Between the wars, Russia offered a place for the German army to develop weapons and train men in violation of the Versailles Treaty.</td>
      <td>Adolf Hitler gets the blame for lighting the fuse of World War II, and for good reason. Yet Germany had a partner in Soviet Russia, not only during the infamous Hitler-Stalin Pact of 1939 but well before, starting with the Treaty of Rapallo in 1922. Without his enablers in Moscow, it’s hard to imagine that Hitler would have dared go to war against the rest of Europe.<br />In “Faustian Bargain,” Ian Ona Johnson shows how extensive Russia’s help was. He begins the story at the end of World War I, which had left the world with two pariah states: Germany because it had begun hostilities, Russia because the Bolshevik Revolution had transformed the country from a wartime ally to a postwar menace. Hardly had the ink dried on the punitive peace treaty signed at Versailles in June 1919 than the two pariahs joined forces.<br />As Mr. Johnson chronicles, Russia offered a place for the German army to develop weapons and train men in violation of the treaty that its civilian government had just signed. In return, Russia would learn how to modernize the Red Army, huge in size but badly trained and poorly equipped. The agreement was formalized at Rapallo, Italy. “Poland must and will be wiped off the map,” wrote Gen. Hans von Seeckt, the man who established Sondergruppe Russland (Special Group Russia), the bureau that would manage military relations between Germany and Russia. Seeckt was referring, of course, to the country that Versailles had resurrected between them. (Poland had been divided between Germany, Russia and the now-vanished Austro-Hungarian Empire.) “It was not an unfair peace that motivated Seeckt and his fellow officers,” Mr. Johnson writes. “It was the far more ambitious aim of reversing Germany’s defeat in the First World War.”<br />Mr. Johnson, who teaches military history at Notre Dame, draws on American, British, German, Polish and Russian archives to describe a “secret school of war.” The resulting book has an academic flavor, but it’s consistently interesting and spiced by the occasional scandal, including one in which a German naval officer brings his Russian girlfriend home to Germany, supporting her through a movie studio he purchased with government money, planning to use it for military propaganda. When the studio goes bankrupt, damning details emerge, triggering high-level resignations and bringing to light “the breadth of Germany’s commitment to rearm.”<br />In the 1920s, without troubling the civilian government in Berlin, the Reichswehr (German defense force) set up a ring of bases south and east of Moscow. German companies like Junkers and Krupp contracted directly with the Soviet government to manufacture warplanes in Russia, deliver coveted German-built locomotives and train Red Army technicians. Versailles had banned all offensive weapons, but the “Black Reichswehr” in Russia included warplanes, battle tanks and poison gas. Russia, for its part, learned alongside the Germans. Stalin was so interested in Krupp’s tank designer Eduard Grotte that he ordered that the man be kept in Russia by “all measures up to arrest.”</td>

On Tuesday, Full Truck slid nearly 6.7% and Kanzhun fell 16%.  Baidu Inc.,   Tencent Music Entertainment Group ,   JD.com Inc.  and  Pinduoduo Inc.  slid between 5% and 6.8%.<br />The latest regulatory actions and stock moves have confounded emerging-market investors, who say they feel stuck between balancing their bullish outlooks on the growth of Chinese tech stocks against increasingly aggressive regulatory attacks from both China and the U.S.<br />“I understand the market; investors hate uncertainty,” said Brendan Ahern, the chief investment officer for KraneShares in New York, of the pullback in Chinese tech stocks. “But despite all the regulatory bark, there’s been no real financial bite to it.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal judge said he can’t schedule a summer trial in the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit challenging insurance broker  Aon  PLC’s proposed acquisition of rival  Willis Towers Watson  PLC, a blow to Aon’s bid to save a deal that expires Sept. 9.<br />U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton instead said Tuesday he plans to hold trial proceedings for a few days beginning Nov. 18, and then again during an opening in his schedule from Dec. 20-22. A decision could take weeks or months after those proceedings conclude.<br />The judge said that he faced a huge backlog of cases because of the coronavirus pandemic. He said that the November and December dates for the Aon litigation may slip, because he also is presiding over several cases related to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, which take priority because of defendants’ speedy-trial rights.<br />“I understand the desire to try and get the case to trial as quickly as possible, but I think it’s impractical,” the judge said during a scheduling hearing.<br />Aon and Willis Towers, both registered in Ireland, announced their roughly $30 billion deal in March 2020. They are two of the world’s biggest insurance brokerages by revenue, alongside New York-based Marsh & McLennan Cos. The brokerages help companies buy insurance and advise them on risk management and are also major consultants to businesses on health and other benefit packages for their employees.</td>

      <td>Heliogen is combining with the SPAC Athena Technology, one of the few so-called blank-check companies led by women</td>
      <td>Heliogen Inc. is merging with a special-purpose acquisition company to go public in a combination that values the concentrated solar power company at about $2 billion, the companies said.<br />Founded in 2013, Heliogen uses mirrors that are positioned with artificial intelligence to reflect sunlight at a small receiver, generating an intense heat. That sunlight can be collected and processed to generate electricity even when the sun goes down, the company says. The renewable energy can also be used to power industrial processes needed to make materials like steel and to produce hydrogen fuel.<br />The company’s CEO is angel investor and entrepreneur Bill Gross—sometimes confused with the bond investor Bill Gross, who co-founded investment giant Pacific Investment Management Co. Heliogen’s Mr. Gross has made a fortune backing internet startups through his Idealab incubator and is now focusing on renewable energy companies. The firm expects to install its first commercial project in 2023.<br />Heliogen is combining with the SPAC Athena Technology Acquisition Corp., one of the few so-called blank-check companies led by women. Cybersecurity executive and former U.S. Army officer Phyllis Newhouse and venture capitalist Isabelle Freidheim are the SPAC’s CEO and board chair, respectively. Former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is one of its advisers.<br />Based in Pasadena, Calif., Heliogen has been testing its technology in a demonstration facility since 2019. It now hopes to scale operations to bring down costs and emissions in energy-intensive industries like mining, Mr. Gross said in an interview.</td>

      <td>The sequel keeps Kristen Bell as narrator, but replaces the rest of its original whitewashed, cisgender characters with a more diverse crew of Upper East Side elites.</td>
      <td>The fictional Constance Billard School—Upper East Side academy of social-media influence, nonbinary sexual athleticism and bile—boasts a number of prominent alumni. Caroline Kennedy. The novelist Colson Whitehead. Supreme Court Justice Byron White. And Nate Archibald, whom one might presume to mean the former point guard and NBA Hall of Famer. One would be wrong.<br />The Nate Archibald cited in the newly rebooted “Gossip Girl”—as those in the know will know—was one of the more prominent characters in the original, which ran on the CW from 2007-12 and was a high-school soap with a new-media spin: The eponymous, anonymous narrator (voice of Kristen Bell) was a social tattler with a blog that kept tabs on the ornate goings-on at Constance and served as its Proustian Page Six. Or, as someone in the new show “remembers,” an “Orwellian Big Sister.”<br />The revamped “GG,” with Ms. Bell’s voice returning omnisciently, cross-pollinates the show’s history with real history and people. It cites Hannah Horvath (the protagonist of “Girls”) as a literary reference. It frames the online prose stylings of certain characters in a comparative-lit context (“It’s like E.M. Forster got roofied by Dorothy Parker and Jacqueline Susann!”). One father recalls Alec Baldwin confiscating his cellphone on Parent-Teacher Night and not giving it back. The show straddles true and false as if it were astride a slippery English saddle. The jokes are often of a very sophisticated variety. Likewise, the sex.<br />Nate “Tiny” Archibald would not have fit in among the alabaster-hued student body of the original show, but that’s one thing about the reboot that’s changed for the better; both female leads are Black, for one thing. Less uplifting will be the level of debauchery and lack of visible education portrayed here. Homework? It takes a back seat to alcohol-and-ecstasy-fueled soirees in Dumbo and pyrotechnical fashion shows at the Park Avenue Armory aplenty.<br />The Queen Bee of Constance is Julien Calloway (the spectacular Jordan Alexander) who, abetted by venomous sidekicks Luna La and Monet de Haan (Zión Moreno and Savannah Smith), maintains a social stranglehold on a school where grades are manipulated and teachers are terrorized. The staff is impotent because the true lesson of Constance Billard is that education is unnecessary when you come from extreme wealth (which the students do, with a few dramatically necessary exceptions). Julien has created an empire of product endorsements, clothing, unearned sociopolitical clout and an Instagram following worth a fortune, but this is largely because she’s already rich and thus an object of worship. It’s all fantasy, of course. But even good sci-fi contains a kernel of truth.</td>

      <td>T-shirt company Esquel Enterprises Ltd. sued the U.S. government Tuesday, alleged that it lost major U.S. customers over the accusation that one of its mills in the Xinjiang region in western China relies on forced labor, which the company denies.<br />In its lawsuit, Esquel asked a federal judge to remove the mill from a Commerce Department export blacklist of businesses that pose a national security threat. U.S. officials placed the mill, Changji Esquel Textile Co., on the list in July 2020, saying it used forced labor from the country’s Muslim minority groups.<br />Brands such as Michael Kors, Nike, Banana Republic, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger have either stopped or said they would stop doing business with the company, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. Deals with those brands “represented hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue in 2019,” the lawsuit added.<br />“Esquel’s reputation as a global leader in sustainable textile manufacturing, built up over many years, has been deeply tarnished by the Trump administration’s reckless labeling of Esquel as a company” that threatens U.S. national security, the lawsuit said.<br />A Commerce Department representative said that it doesn’t comment on litigation.</td>

People close to the situation say the company could be valued at as much $1 billion in a deal.<br />Hello Sunshine is working with investment bankers as it explores its options, the people familiar with the matter say. There is no guarantee the company will find a buyer.<br />Hello Sunshine’s production slate also includes Hulu’s “Little Fires Everywhere,” a limited series starring Ms. Witherspoon and Kerry Washington as mothers in suburban Ohio, and Apple’s “The Morning Show,” which stars Ms. Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston as morning show hosts.<br />Hello Sunshine is owned by Ms. Witherspoon and her partners, Seth Rodsky and Jim Toth, a former agent at Creative Artists Agency who is Ms. Witherspoon’s husband.
