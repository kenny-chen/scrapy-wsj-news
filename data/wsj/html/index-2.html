      <td>Search giant faces two—likely soon to be three—antitrust lawsuits</td>
      <td>A pair of sweeping antitrust lawsuits against Google this fall essentially grapple with one central question: Is Google good?<br />For most of its 22-year history, the search giant has enjoyed an enviable public reputation as an omnipresent yet benevolent force. As its parent,  Alphabet Inc.,  morphed into a trillion-dollar conglomerate—more than five times as large as a decade ago—top executives stuck to their line that Google’s market dominance is simply because consumers choose to use its products. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said this year, “I’m really focused on giving users what they want.”<br />The antitrust lawsuits—from federal prosecutors and a separate coalition of 10 states—allege nefarious activities. They say Google, through secretive, interlocking agreements with other technology giants including  Apple Inc.  and  Facebook Inc.,  muscles out competitors and sells out the very users it claims to protect. “The halcyon days of Google’s youth are a distant memory,” says the state lawsuit, led by Texas. “Its modus operandi is to monopolize and misrepresent.”<br />Here is a look at the dueling narratives.<br />Federal and state prosecutors undertook separate, overlapping investigations over the course of roughly a year and a half. The federal suit, filed in October, focused on Google’s flagship search business, which accounts for the vast majority of U.S. queries. The government said the status quo effectively left no room for competition.</td>

The weekly figures can be volatile around the holidays due to seasonal-adjustment issues.<br />“The next few months will be pretty rough for the labor market as you do see businesses having to contend with this latest wave of Covid cases,” Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities, said. “You are seeing those government restrictions coming into play again.”<br />Ms. House, and many other economists, project the labor market will cool until vaccines are widely distributed. More than 90% of economists in a recent Wall Street Journal survey said they expect the rollout of coronavirus vaccines will cause hiring to accelerate in the second quarter of next year.</td>

Rising cases appear to have hit consumer sentiment, weighing on retail sales, and there are new business restrictions in some states.<br />“The stimulus is key,” said Mary Nicola, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments.</td>

      <td>The NBA title usually goes to a team with the best players, the finest strategy and the most luck. But this year, with the league rushing toward the start of a new season during a bleak stretch of the Covid-19 pandemic, that might not be enough. There is another crucial metric that could determine the next champion.<br />“Which team is not going to have positive people,” said Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic.<br />The greatest source of uncertainty before the most uncertain NBA season of all time begins next week is how teams will deal with the extended absences, sudden disruptions and the inevitable volatility that comes with playing basketball in a pandemic. There has never been a better time to have a deep roster—because what happens off the court will dictate who’s on the court.<br />Unlike the last time they played, when the NBA sequestered itself in a bubble, teams will be traveling across the country and risking coronavirus infections to play a 72-game compressed season. The timing could not be worse. Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. are nearing or breaking record highs and public health officials are predicting that January will be the darkest month of a grim winter before mass vaccinations end the pandemic.<br />Most arenas will be empty. Practice gyms have already closed for deep cleaning. The Toronto Raptors are snowbirding in Tampa, Fla. Players will disappear when they test positive and games might be postponed if entire teams have to enter quarantine.</td>

While inaugural events on the Capitol grounds are paid for by Congress, the Presidential Inaugural Committee typically pays for receptions, concerts and other programming, a spokeswoman for the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies said.</td>

Next year, the focus may be on the country’s zombie companies.<br />The country’s existing problem with corporate debt has been magnified by the pandemic: Nonfinancial corporate leverage is once again within striking distance of the record highs it reached before the Asian Financial Crisis of the late 1990s. Household debt is at nearly 100% of gross domestic product, and has reached a record high in every quarter for the last seven years.<br />So-called marginal companies, those without enough earnings to pay debt interest costs three years in a row, are growing in number. According to data released by the Korea Capital Market Institute, there were 4,069 such firms among those subject to external audit in 2019, more than twice the number in 2008, and a record share of the total number of companies in that category.<br />According to research earlier this year by the Federation of Korean Industries, the country’s share of marginal firms is the fifth highest in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Among services sector firms, it has the second-highest rate, surpassed only by Turkey.<br />The country’s public banks are a not-inconsiderable part of the problem, according to work by Daehee Jeong, an economist at the Korea Development Institute. They have made loans to the country’s large and less profitable corporations, keeping them going.</td>

      <td>PARIS—French President Emmanuel Macron tested positive for the coronavirus, his office said Thursday, delivering a blow to a country that has been among Europe’s hardest hit by the pandemic.<br />The 42-year-old was tested after showing symptoms of Covid-19, the Élysée Palace said, adding that he will isolate for seven days while continuing to work. Mr. Macron hasn’t shown severe symptoms, according to a person close to the president.<br />Mr. Macron’s test result immediately rippled across Europe, affecting the activities of a number of leaders who have recently been in contact with him. The Élysée Palace said he received his test results on Thursday, but didn’t specify when the test was administered.<br />The French leader has maintained a busy schedule this fall as France grappled with an onslaught of Covid-19 infections that triggered a six-week lockdown, which was recently replaced with an 8 p.m. curfew. Bars, restaurants and theaters have remained closed across France, but the government has allowed stores and many other businesses to resume operations for the Christmas shopping season. The government plans to relax the curfew on Christmas Eve, allowing holiday gatherings to take place.<br />On Monday, Mr. Macron hosted a lunch with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, European Council President Charles Michel and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Secretary-General Angel Gurría. That was followed by a Tuesday lunch with the party whips of France’s National Assembly. On Wednesday, he lunched with Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa and presided over a cabinet meeting, in which everyone present wore masks and adhered to social-distancing guidelines, a spokeswoman said.</td>

      <td>Delivery platforms could lose their appeal for restaurants after the coronavirus pandemic ends</td>
      <td>Investors bidding up newly public shares of  DoorDash  and its competitors shouldn’t take for granted the historically fragile relationship between food-delivery platforms and the restaurants they serve.<br />While it is unclear just how sticky eaters’ business will be on delivery apps once the coronavirus pandemic ends, their loyalty could in many cases depend upon whether their favorite restaurants stay around. That is hardly a guarantee.<br />Delivery platforms have been essential to the survival of many restaurants this year, bringing them business even while their dining rooms have remained closed down. In addition to offering grants and relaxed delivery fees in some cases, the platforms have been working to use the pandemic as an opportunity to prove their long-term value to restaurants, many of which had once scorned their services because of high commissions or questionable business practices.<br />There is no question delivery players have won over lots of new restaurants for now. This is evidenced by big increases across platforms in partnered restaurants, or those with which platforms have an agreement to offer their goods to consumers. In the first nine months of the year, for example, regulatory filings show  Grubhub  added approximately 90,000 partnered restaurants, or 37% of the total number it had as of Sept. 30.  Uber Technologies  said in its third-quarter report that Uber Eats grew active partnered restaurants by 70% year over year.<br />DoorDash similarly seems to have added something like 50,000 merchants in the several months before its initial public offering filing alone. And although its early growth may have been in part fueled by facilitating deliveries without prior consent of restaurants, according to D.A. Davidson analyst Tom White, DoorDash now says partner merchants account for nearly all the platform’s gross order value.</td>

      <td>Subscribers’ picks beat both the market and our columnists in Heard on the Street’s fourth annual stock-picking contest</td>
      <td>Ignoring scary headlines can boost your bottom line.<br />Heard on the Street’s columnists and 1,764 of our readers had to contend with the thorniest environment of our four annual stock-picking contests so far: a global pandemic, a contentious U.S. presidential election and record-high prices for technology stocks. Despite a deadly second surge of Covid-19 and a political contest that left a bitter aftertaste, stocks hit fresh records. People in much of the world hunkered down but kept up their spending on physical purchases even as investors grew more confident that they would soon spend again on experiences. The best performers of all were companies with shiny, new technologies and lots of skeptics.<br />Heard’s columnists anticipated some of this but were too pessimistic overall. Our picks had an average return of only 5.4%, not including dividends, lagging behind the S&P 500. The top 14 performers were all “buy” recommendations, while the seven worst picks were all “sells.” Readers were more attuned to the markets’ mood, with a total return of 14.5% across their 3,390 picks.<br />The best Heard bet by far, and 296th overall in the contest, was by retail columnist Jinjoo Lee, whose old-school pick,  Qurate Retail ,  managed to shine in a tough year for physical stores, rising 65%. The owner of television shopping bazaar QVC has expanded sales during the pandemic yet sported a bargain-bin valuation compared with department stores and big-box retailers. The second-best Heard pick, Jon Sindreu’s recommendation to buy  Axon Enterprise ,  the maker of Tasers and police body cameras, rose 57% on concern over public unrest and a backlash against police brutality. The next two winning picks were both non-U.S. auto makers,  Fiat Chrysler  and Geely Automotive, recommended by Stephen Wilmot and Jacky Wong, respectively.<br />But 223 readers bet on an auto maker that left those companies in the dust:  Tesla .  The electric-car pioneer already was worth more than several established manufacturers in August and by this month had a market capitalization as high as several of them combined. Its valuation seemed ludicrous enough in August 2019, when selling Tesla was the most popular bet in our contest of that year. That ended badly, yet hope triumphed over experience as some 237 subscriber picks in this year’s contest were shorts on Tesla. Its shares have surged 114% since the first week of August.</td>

      <td>Superlow rates may be slowing the move to a replacement benchmark; more time for some loans to switch could ease the final transition</td>
      <td>The transition period away from the universal but tarnished funding benchmark, the London interbank offered rate, in the U.S. has gotten a bit longer for some loans. That will be mostly welcome news for many investors.<br />The typical investor’s exposure to the risks of a transition to a new benchmark aren’t terribly direct. Credit cards are typically floating-rate, but are often linked to the prime rate, not Libor—although the cost of funding for some card loans may be via securitizations priced in Libor terms. A subset of investors may own preferred shares, like those issued by banks, whose payouts are tied to Libor.<br />But a more common exposure is via mortgages. Over $1 trillion worth of residential mortgages are estimated to have adjustable rates linked to Libor. Funding for mortgage loans historically also is often Libor-based, via warehouse lines from banks, the securitization market or Federal Home Loan Bank advances. In addition to being home borrowers, many investors are now also betting on the mortgage business itself via stocks like rapidly growing and highly valued originator  Rocket  Cos.<br />For mortgages, a delay in the end of Libor might come at just the right time. U.S. regulators in November backed a proposal that while new debt still shouldn’t be linked to Libor beyond 2021, many existing debts can continue to reference it for another 18 months, through June 2023.<br />That means the transition period for many loans may be put off to a time when rates are less extraordinarily low, which could be a good thing. Right now there is relatively little demand for certain floating-rate mortgages or funding, which some analysts say has slowed the market’s evolution toward a new benchmark.</td>

      <td>Chinese EV companies—most of them unprofitable—have seen their valuations soar to levels similar to those of the American auto giants</td>
      <td>China’s electric-vehicle makers have surged in value, boosted by bold national green-energy targets and individual investors hoping for a repeat of  Tesla Inc.’s  stunning performance.<br />American depositary receipts in  NIO Inc.,  the best known Chinese company focused solely on electric vehicles, have jumped roughly 11-fold this year, lifting its market value to nearly $70 billion as of Wednesday, according to FactSet. In Hong Kong, shares of Warren Buffett-backed  BYD Co. , which produces hybrid electric- and gasoline-powered cars, as well as batteries, have more than quadrupled, valuing it at $69 billion.<br />The meteoric rises put these companies in line with large traditional car makers, such as  General Motors Co.  and  Ford Motor Co. , which had market values of $59 billion and $36 billion, respectively, on a fully diluted basis.<br />For now, though, most Chinese upstarts are unprofitable—and they are also selling far fewer vehicles than major automobile groups.  Xpeng Inc.,  for example, delivered more than 14,000 cars in the first three quarters of 2020. By comparison, GM sold more than 1.9 million cars in China during the same period.<br />Tesla’s success has fed investor enthusiasm, as has China’s pledge to become carbon-neutral by 2060, said Elizabeth Kwik, investment manager for Asian equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “China is very serious about achieving this goal,” she said, citing President Xi Jinping’s personal endorsement.</td>

Chief Operating Officer Tom Staggs.<br />Weta—named after an insect endemic to New Zealand—is also on the hunt for acquisitions in the special effects and animation space, part of a strategy to pivot into content creation as new streaming platforms look to stock up on fresh programming.<br />“We have a crew of over 1,200 people, very skilled, very talented people doing the best special effects I think that anyone does,” Mr. Jackson said in an interview. “And so we thought, how can we give this crew exciting projects going forward that go beyond just providing some shots for other people’s films.”<br />Mr. Jackson sees a big opportunity to provide animated programming for streaming services as well as movies and cable channels. “There’s a demand that’s tending to outstrip supply right now,” he said. Another plus for animation is that it is Covid-proof. While fears of the spread of coronavirus have made it challenging to shoot on TV and movie sets, animation work can be done remotely.</td>

Mr. van Rooijen tried engaging a real-estate agent and listing the property on Facebook Inc.’s Marketplace platform, alongside secondhand lawn mowers and coffee tables. He eventually accepted a 17% cut in rent to fill the property.<br />Apartments are turning out to be the big losers in a pandemic-fueled reordering of the global property market. Record-low mortgage rates, work-from-home arrangements and a desire for more space have driven demand for houses at the expense of apartments. According to  Redfin Corp. , an online real-estate platform, the average price discount for condos in the U.S. has widened to a record 17.3% this year.</td>

Hopes of a positive outcome have buoyed sterling this week, and an agreement is crucial for goods industries with complex supply chains, such as autos and food. But a deal that preserves anything like the status quo in financial services isn’t on the table.<br />That means U.K.-based financial institutions will lose their “passports” to transact freely in the EU on Dec. 31, while EU companies won’t be able to deal as freely in London. The change will fragment liquidity and add cost and complexity for all manner of operations that in recent decades have settled in London.<br />Among the few beneficiaries will likely be U.S. derivatives exchanges that are authorized by both jurisdictions.</td>

Luckin neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s fraud claims, which were filed in Manhattan federal court. The settlement is subject to a federal judge’s approval.<br />Luckin intentionally faked more than $300 million in retail sales from April 2019 to January 2020 by using related parties to create fake sales transactions, the SEC said. The Wall Street Journal reported in May that Luckin sold vouchers redeemable for tens of millions of cups of coffee to companies that had ties to Luckin’s chairman and controlling shareholder, Charles Lu.<br />Luckin, once a highflying competitor to  Starbucks  Corp.  in China, went public on the  Nasdaq  Stock Market in 2019. Its disclosure of financial-reporting failures earlier this year caused its shares to plummet 75%. The debacle put a spotlight on U.S. regulators’ inability to inspect the audits of American-listed Chinese companies, a compliance gap that gained attention in Congress this year.<br />Mr. Lu stepped down from Luckin’s board in July, and the Nasdaq delisted Luckin’s shares on July 13.

      <td>The central bank again revises its growth forecasts upward.</td>
      <td>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continues to stump for more economic “stimulus,” yet on Wednesday the Federal Open Market Committee mainly stood pat. Even more telling, the FOMC’s members again revised up their predictions for the economy this year and next.<br />The Fed itself was reportedly considering an increase in its purchases of Treasurys and mortgage securities, or at least extending the duration of its bond holdings to drive investors into riskier assets. The FOMC did neither. It said it will continue its current monthly rate of asset purchases of “at least” $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion of mortgage securities until there is “substantial” progress toward its targets of low unemployment and inflation above 2% for a sustained period.<br />This is highly accommodative policy, and we welcome the restraint not to go further. But why the mismatch between Fed words and deeds? Our guess is that it’s a mix of politics and economics. On the former, Mr. Powell wants to be in sync with the politicians who want to spend more money amid the pandemic. The chairman saluted that desire at his afternoon press conference by again exceeding his policy mandate to endorse whatever spending bill Congress comes up with.<br />Yet in their economic outlook, the Fed’s leaders again revised their forecasts in the direction of better growth and lower unemployment. The median projection of Fed governors and regional bank presidents for growth in all of 2020 improved to minus-2.4%, which is up from minus-3.7% in September, which was up from minus-6.5% in June. Their estimate for the jobless rate at the end of this year also fell to 6.7%, which is down from 7.6% in September, which was down from 9.3% in June.<br />The Fed’s economists clearly misjudged the economy’s resilience during the pandemic. Now Mr. Powell is predicting a rough few months as Covid-19 inspections spike. But the Fed also increased its median estimate for growth in 2021 to 4.2%, which is up from 4% in September. The sages are predicting that the jobless rate will fall to 5% in 2021, from 6.7% today.</td>

      <td>Checking Cobb County’s absentees to shore up public confidence.</td>
      <td>The two Senate runoffs in Georgia are scheduled for Jan. 5, but around 700,000 ballots have already been cast. Enthusiasm is high, and no wonder, since what’s at stake is control of the Senate, Joe Biden’s legislative agenda, and the nation’s direction for two years.<br />The GOP will have big problems if sizable numbers of Trump supporters in Georgia decide they don’t trust the state’s election system enough to participate. President Trump has attacked Georgia’s voting process in his attempt to contest Joe Biden’s victory. So maybe this could shore up the public’s faith: Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Monday launched an audit of recent absentee signatures in Cobb County.<br />“Now that the signature matching has been attacked again and again, with no evidence,” Mr. Raffensperger said, “I feel we need to take steps to restore confidence in our elections.” That’s a reference to Mr. Trump and his allies, who have sought to cast a cloud over the state’s rules for verifying absentee signatures.<br />A Trump lawsuit in state court contends that Georgia’s overall rejection rate for mail votes in November was 0.34%, a steep drop from 2.9% in 2016. This shows, the filing argues, that signatures weren’t properly checked. Not necessarily: Georgia officials say the rejection rate specifically due to signature problems was 0.15%, closely matching 2018. What apparently plummeted was the share of ballots thrown out for other reasons, including lateness.<br />This year’s expansion of the mail franchise included steps to ensure that voters cast their ballots properly. Georgia approved ballot drop boxes for the first time, and there were more than 100 in the Atlanta area alone. A week before Nov. 3, Mr. Raffensperger urged people to think twice before putting a vote in the mail. A 2019 law simplified absentee ballots, while allowing Georgians to “cure” errors using a process that didn’t exist in 2016.</td>

The outcome has been apparent for weeks, as one Trump campaign lawsuit after another flamed out. Now even prominent Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are acknowledging Mr. Biden will be America’s 46th president.<br />As one person moves into the Oval Office, another moves out—and so Donald Trump will exit 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, presumably to refinance his business, deal with investigations by the Manhattan district attorney and New York attorney general and keep his options open for 2024.<br />During this process, Mr. Biden has mostly struck grace notes. Despite provocations, he’s resisted inflammatory rhetoric and endeavored to turn down the temperature of our politics. Until Monday. The president-elect’s tone that night was a mistake.<br />In his televised remarks accepting the Electoral College results, Mr. Biden angrily denounced Mr. Trump’s efforts to flip the election. He called them “extreme” and “unprecedented” and accused Mr. Trump of having “refused to respect . . . the rule of law” or to “honor our Constitution.” He lectured Mr. Trump about “respecting the will of the people” even if he found those results “hard to accept.”<br />These points have some validity. The efforts of the Trump legal team were often indefensible. Team Trump’s rhetoric was frequently over the top and backed with scant evidence. But this wasn’t the time to make that point. The inevitable result is that the attacks drew the headlines, not Mr. Biden’s declaration that “we can work together for the good of the nation,” not his call for the country “to unite, to heal,” and not his promise to “be a president for all Americans.”</td>

      <td>For the first time in their lives, millions of Americans have been ordered by their government not to attend church. For millions of persecuted Christians across the globe, this is the only reality they know.<br />The theme of persecution lies at the heart of the Christmas story. The Holy Family were forced to flee their native land due to state-sponsored oppression. As citizens of a global superpower whose lawmakers are responsive to their citizens, we are called to stand in solidarity with persecuted Christians. The U.S. government has shown during this difficult year that it is responsive to such advocacy.<br />The House unanimously passed a resolution in November calling for continued humanitarian assistance to Christians, Yazidis and other communities that survived the ISIS genocide in Iraq and Syria. Also last month, the State Department and the Polish government hosted the third annual Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, an international forum for governments and civil society.<br />At the same time, 2020 has presented unprecedented challenges for persecuted Christians world-wide.<br />In Nigeria, according to Gregory Stanton of Genocide Watch, more than 27,000 Christians have died since 2009 at the hands of Fulani militants, Boko Haram and other Islamic militias—exceeding the number of ISIS casualties in Iraq and Syria.</td>

      <td>German planes were spotted high above. What followed may have been the most intense aerial attack on a single ship during all of World War II.</td>
      <td>On Jan. 24, 1944, the destroyer USS Plunkett found herself offshore Anzio, Italy, supporting the embattled Allied beachhead there. The ship had had an eventful year, participating in the invasions of North Africa and Sicily. Like all destroyers, Plunkett was fast and well-armed for her size. She had many roles, including shepherding other ships and patrolling, but destruction was her natural job. On this day in the Tyrrhenian Sea, the men aboard were disappointed that some much-anticipated shelling of German positions ashore had been canceled.<br />At around 5:15 p.m., the ship’s doctor spotted a couple of German bombers, Dorniers, in the early-evening sky, fairly high up. The Anzio roadstead was thick with Allied ships, but the Germans owned the skies. “Looks like a little business coming up,” said the doctor almost to himself. “I think I’ll go down to the wardroom.” As James Sullivan tells us in his stirring “Unsinkable: Five Men and the Indomitable Run of the USS Plunkett,” the destroyer’s wardroom—the officers’ mess, at sea—did double duty in battle, serving as the dressing station for the wounded and dying. It would prove to be a busy place that evening.<br />Soon after calling his crew to battle stations, Plunkett’s captain, Ed Burke—one of the five men that Mr. Sullivan follows from the 1940s through the ends of their lives—could see the glide-bombs from the far-off Dorniers floating his way. What followed over the next 25 minutes may have been the most intense aerial attack on a single ship of any navy in World War II.<br />Soon the Dorniers were joined by dive bombers shrieking in, while torpedo planes came in “low and slow” to drop their sinister payloads that barely moved faster through the water than Plunkett herself. Capt. Burke successfully zigged toward the glide bombs, zagged to run parallel to a torpedo, dodged dive bombs that were landing as close to 20 yards away, and through it all, whenever he could, put the ship broadside on to the planes so his guns would have a chance. Eventually Plunkett was ablaze, but her guns kept firing with coordination and accuracy until the Luftwaffe had to call off the attack. Plunkett’s “bag” that day was impossible to verify, but it likely represented a quarter or more of the force that attacked her. The ship’s casualty list would include, apart from the scores of wounded, 29 men forever “missing in action.” These numbered more than the dead whose bodies could be identified. Plunkett managed to limp back to Palermo, saw action in Normandy on D-Day and ended her war in the Pacific.<br />Plunkett’s fate and what she achieved in those few minutes of Mediterranean gloaming were utterly tragic and utterly heroic. And yet the action was a drop in the ocean of that war. Sicily had been the largest seaborne invasion of anywhere ever, and Normandy 11 months later would dwarf it. Leyte Gulf, in the Pacific Theater, was the biggest naval battle of all time, and the opposing navies rarely saw each other: Planes did the attacking, as with Plunkett at Anzio, but on a titanic scale.</td>

      <td>Mercantile interests are behind India’s and South Africa’s high-minded talk about helping the poor.</td>
      <td>The World Trade Organization will decide on Thursday whether to approve an Indian and South African proposal that would allow countries to disregard intellectual-property protections on Covid vaccines and therapeutics. Proponents claim the move would increase patients’ access to vaccines, especially in the developing world, by enabling companies to mass-manufacture generic copies of those drugs. In reality, suspending intellectual-property rights would make things much worse. The proposal is cynical—designed to benefit India’s and South Africa’s domestic drug industries at the expense of patients around the world.<br />India is the world’s largest manufacturer of generic drugs, and South Africa is another big producer. They lament that the U.S. and Europe have blocked intellectual-property rights suspension, even though a greater number of WTO member countries are in favor.<br />I’ve heard this line of attack before, and it is fraught with danger.<br />From 2010-15, I ran the international patent system for the World Intellectual Property Organization, a United Nations agency in Geneva. WIPO administers the global systems for patent, copyright and trademark protection, and its member countries include all those in the WTO. I helped conduct meetings designed to improve intellectual-property laws around the world and thereby create incentives for private innovation that benefits people world-wide.<br />At those meetings, India consistently questioned the need for patent laws, repeatedly pointing to the failure of pharmaceutical companies to recognize and respond to the AIDS crisis of the 1980s. Indian delegates harped on this outdated criticism, even though manufacturers have made AIDS medicines available in developing countries at a fraction of their domestic prices.</td>

      <td>The Sierra Club hijacks a state agency in an effort to force Californians to use electric stoves and ovens.</td>
      <td>Californians pay twice as much for electricity as Nevadans and Oregonians do. In return they get rolling blackouts during heat waves and power cutoffs in windstorms to prevent fires caused by old equipment. So where’s the Public Utilities Commission’s Public Advocates Office? Its statutory mandate is “to obtain the lowest possible rate for service consistent with reliable and safe service levels.” Instead it’s busy trying to banish fossil fuels.<br />The office has teamed up with the Sierra Club against Southern California Gas. The Sierra Club has been pushing cities and the state Energy Commission to ban natural-gas hookups in new buildings. Some three dozen cities have done so.<br />SoCalGas is fighting these bans, as are homebuilders, realtors and commercial real-estate groups, which noted in a public comment to the Energy Commission that “in a survey conducted just two years ago, over 70% of the respondents indicated they would NOT want a home with an electric stove.”<br />Replacing natural gas appliances with electric ones is expensive. In the Central Valley, new-home buyers would pay $250 more a year to operate an all-electric home—and that’s before a planned 30% increase in electric rates over the next few years. The move to electric appliances would also increase demand for current, necessitating more blackouts. More than 120 localities have passed resolutions against gas bans.<br />Enter the Public Advocates Office. It accuses SoCalGas of illegally spending ratepayer dollars on political advocacy. The office has asked the utility commission to fine the company $379 million. SoCalGas says shareholders have financed its political lobbying. It acknowledges having spent some ratepayer dollars on public education, which is permitted. The distinction between public education and political advocacy can be fuzzy. Electric utilities are allowed to spend ratepayer dollars to promote electric vehicles.</td>

The complaint raises the prospect of a first U.S. trial related to the incident. Among the Americans who died were 35 students from Syracuse University in New York. The 32nd anniversary of the attack is on Monday.<br />The bombing led U.S. lawmakers to brand Libya as a state sponsor of terrorism and eventually forced the Libyan government in 2003 to pay more than $1 billion as recompense to the families of the victims.<br />The case, filed by prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, D.C., is based largely on a confession that Mr. Masud gave to Libyan authorities in 2012, which was turned over to Scottish authorities in 2017, as well as travel and immigration records of Mr. Masud, U.S. officials said.</td>

      <td>Central bank pledges to keep up asset purchases, giving investors less reason to worry about high stock prices</td>
      <td>The Federal Reserve added a bit more support to the economy Wednesday, which should keep stocks and asset prices high. And if the economy weakens further, more support could be on its way.<br />Following their two-day meeting, Fed officials released a policy statement that was virtually unchanged from November’s meeting, except for one crucial difference. While at that meeting they continued their pledge to keep buying $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage bonds “over coming months,” on Wednesday they said they would sustain those asset purchases “until substantial further progress” has been made toward their goals of full employment and 2% inflation.<br />That suggests the Fed will be buying assets for a long time. Projections released alongside Wednesday’s statement show that officials’ median projection for the unemployment rate over the long run—essentially, their assessment of where it would be under full employment—is 4.1%. They don’t expect it to reach that level until some time in 2023. They don’t think that inflation will reach 2% until 2023, either.<br />Coupled with the Fed’s earlier promise to keep its target range on overnight rates near zero until it sees evidence of a tight labor market and inflation has obviously cleared its 2% target rate, Wednesday’s announcement suggests both short- and long-term rates will remain low for some time. That means Treasurys might not offer much competition for stocks in the years ahead, making it easier for many equity investors to stomach high valuations.<br />How much support the Fed’s pledges give to the economy, as opposed to asset prices, is an open question, given that the root of the economy’s current difficulties is the pandemic rather than any problem in lending markets. Still, if the alternative is doing nothing, the Fed’s inclination is to do more.</td>

      <td>Rep. Eric Swalwell (D., Calif.) hasn’t been willing to say much about his relationship with an alleged spy for the Chinese Communist Party, citing a need to protect classified information. But both the congressman and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) owe the public an explanation for a remarkable series of events when Mr. Swalwell joined the House Intelligence Committee.<br />“[Rep. Swalwell] keeps hiding behind the cloak of classified information, but there’s nothing classified about his fundraising practices or his social life,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) tells Fox News.<br />Over in the House, many Republicans want more than an explanation, writing in a Tuesday letter to the Speaker:<br />According to the Axios story, the interactions included the alleged agent known as Fang Fang or Christine Fang placing an intern in Rep. Swalwell’s office and also helping to raise funds for his 2014 re-election campaign. Axios reported that the FBI gave Mr. Swalwell a defensive briefing sometime around 2015 to warn him of the threat.<br />Since Axios broke the story, one of the few disclosures Mr. Swalwell has been willing to make occurred in an interview with CNN’s Jim Sciutto, when the lawmaker clarified the timeline. Mr. Sciutto asked the Congressman if he had had any concerns about the woman before receiving the defensive briefing from the FBI. Rep. Swalwell responded:</td>

A company spokesman declined to identify the terminated managers.<br />The claims surfaced as Tyson and other U.S. meat processors face another national surge in Covid-19 infections. Record numbers of cases around the country have tested defenses meat companies put in place in response to springtime outbreaks that sickened thousands of workers, forced temporary plant closures and led to meat shortages in some supermarkets.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the National Collegiate Athletic Association violated federal antitrust law by maintaining tight limits on compensating college athletes, a case that could determine the future shape of college sports.<br />The court, in a brief written order Wednesday, said it would hear the NCAA’s appeal of lower court rulings that found the association unlawfully limited competition for college athletes by restricting the kinds of compensation they could receive related to their education.<br />Those rulings cleared the way for college athletes to receive an expanded range of education-related benefits, such as laptop computers or musical instruments, study-abroad programs, internships and paid-for graduate school. The rulings didn’t lift NCAA limits on athlete compensation unrelated to education.<br />The Supreme Court is stepping into a legal and political fight that has subsequently expanded dramatically and is now not just about athlete compensation, but also control of the multibillion-dollar college-sports industry.<br />In the years since former West Virginia University running back Shawne Alston and other former Division I athletes filed their suit, states have brought unprecedented pressure on the NCAA to allow direct compensation to athletes for the use of their names, images or likenesses. In response, the NCAA tore up its decadeslong definition of amateurism and conceded that it will allow some endorsement money to flow to college athletes starting in the 2021-2022 school year.</td>

Twitter plans to begin enforcing the new rules Dec. 21.<br />A large chunk of people in the U.S. get their news from social media.

      <td>New York City Ballet and Pacific Northwest Ballet offer filmed productions of George Balanchine’s staging of Tchaikovsky’s Christmas classic.</td>
      <td>Two films of “George Balanchine’s ‘The Nutcracker,’” one made by Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle and the other by New York City Ballet, began streaming on Friday. But for the current pandemic, these troupes would be performing the work, live, for most of December in front of their theaters’ audiences.<br />The films, which require a ticket purchase for online viewing, are just two signs of the long coast-to-coast fame of Balanchine’s ballet. First given by NYCB in 1954, the two-act work to Tchaikovsky’s 1892 score set a standard that has made this Christmas-themed ballet a sought-after holiday event. The NYCB film was shot in 2019 for use in an upcoming Disney+ documentary series about the School of American Ballet and documents the production Balanchine himself revamped in 1964 and oversaw until his death in 1983. PNB’s was first performed in 2015 and was filmed in 2018 for archival purposes, its tweaks in design and production framing the scrupulously staged Balanchine choreography.<br />Unlike numerous “Nutcracker” stagings by other choreographers in which adults play the story’s youngsters, the Balanchine work confidently uses real children to artfully enact the narrative’s characters at its homey Christmas gathering—one that magically evolves into a story about an enchanted Nutcracker and an ensuing battle between toy soldiers and aggressive mice, before concluding in a fairy kingdom. More than 60 students from their respective ballet schools are involved in each production filmed here; the age range is 9 through 13 in Seattle and 8 through 13 in New York.<br />As caught in this filming, PNB’s visual style suggests a Currier and Ives print; NYCB’s filmed result resembles a sepia-toned tintype photograph. Wide shots allow viewers to appreciate the productions’ full-stage dimensions to the maximum and both movies feature occasional, judicious close-ups.<br />Both films were shot in HD, though PNB’s is clearer and crisper, with James F. Ingalls’s high-contrast lighting making for wondrous changes to both the interior and exterior scenes. Ian Falconer’s striking, New England-inspired settings, amplified by some animated film moments, and his hard-edge costuming ably support the choreography.</td>

They said he acted at the direction of an unidentified senior al-Shabaab commander who was also responsible for planning a 2019 attack at a Nairobi hotel.<br />“This chilling callback to the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001, is a stark reminder that terrorist groups like al Shabaab remain committed to killing U.S. citizens and attacking the United States,” acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a statement.<br />Prosecutors charged Mr. Abdullah with providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, conspiring to murder U.S. nationals, conspiring to commit aircraft piracy and other crimes. He faces up to life in prison.<br />Mr. Abdullah was arrested in the Philippines on local charges in July 2019 and transferred to U.S. law enforcement Tuesday.</td>

Not if You Need an M.D.” (Dec. 12) is coming from those who imagine it had to do with Jill Biden’s being a woman. That’s wrong.<br />I taught at a university whose president, a former football coach who held a degree in physical education, wrote a book titled “Nobody Calls Me Doctor.” Bud Davis was an amiable fellow, willing to laugh about his degree.<br />There are degrees, however, that mean something. Readers of Boswell’s “Life of Johnson” will recall that Samuel Johnson had to leave Oxford early after the death of his father and became Dr. Johnson only after he had completed his great “Dictionary of the English Language.” The Oxford doctorate he was then awarded may be described as honorary but entirely real.<br />The issue raised by Mr. Epstein has nothing to do with women as such. It has to do with a certain tremulous American hypocrisy about what constitutes genuine accomplishment.

Mr. Becerra will ensure that all of these are put into play as part of a “build back better” government-run health-care agenda.<br />The experiment in California has led to higher taxes, fewer health-insurance options and more expensive products and services.

The successful return of a lunar landing craft to Earth is the world’s first since a Soviet mission in 1976.<br />China Central Television coverage showed the craft intact and nestled in the snowy ground and being approached by helicopters. It took some time after it touched down for ground crews to locate the roughly 3-foot-wide capsule in the dark and state media cited challenges in getting vehicles across the flat expanse to retrieve it.<br />China’s complicated Chang’e 5 mission began on Nov. 24. The space vehicle included orbiter, lander and ascender with maneuvers that included reuniting spacecraft 200 miles from the lunar surface for a transfer of captured moon material before firing off for a return to Earth.<br />The Chang’e 5 probe, China’s third exploration on the moon’s surface, had spent 19 hours on the surface and used robotic equipment to drill about 2 feet deep to recover around 4.4 pounds of rock and material. “These samples will be studied to uncover clues to the moon’s multi-billion-year history,” according to a report by CCTV, the state broadcaster.</td>

The families have come to demand answers on how Boko Haram, the jihadist group that has claimed responsibility for the attack, could have ventured so far from its strongholds into this remote corner of northwest Nigeria and seized hundreds of their children.<br />“How could this have happened?” said Suwaiba Lawan, whose 15-year-old son is among the missing. “He loved it here, and always helps with chores around the home.” Another mother, Jamila Salisu, said she had barely slept or eaten since her own son, from the same class, had disappeared: “The government must negotiate,” she said through tears. “Give the terrorists whatever they want so I can see my son again.”<br />Six years after the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in the town of Chibok ignited the global #BringBackOurGirls campaign, the cries of schoolchildren’s parents are again echoing across Africa’s most-populous nation. Nigerian senators, celebrities and opposition leaders have reacted with horror to the announcement by the Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau—the man responsible for the Chibok abduction—that he also carried out this operation. Thousands are spreading the word on social media with a new hashtag: #BringBackOurBoys.<br />“This is shaping up to be another huge moment in the history of Nigeria’s insurgency,” said Jacob Zenn, a specialist on Boko Haram at the Washington-based Jamestown Foundation think tank. “After Chibok, Shekau not only knows how to conduct mass kidnapping operations, but also how to hide the captives and then get mass media attention and leverage it to negotiate.”</td>

      <td>While still off-limits to most international tourists, Kyoto in many ways feels remarkably unchanged, writes Pico Iyer of his adopted home</td>
      <td>IT’S HARD to believe that, in April, some of Kyoto’s aromatic tourist streets were empty. A few nights ago, hundreds of people were lined up outside Kōdai-ji, in Kyoto, to walk around the temple’s annual autumn “Light-Up.” The following morning, in my neighborhood, kids were scuffling to school and my elderly friends at the gym were preparing for hours of furious Ping-Pong. It could be any December, really—depthless blue skies above russet and gold leaves—as I step into my local bus and realize there’s barely any room for me to stand.<br />A Martian touching down in Kyoto tomorrow might never guess that we’re in the throes of a global health crisis. Yes, the Land of the Bow reflexively practices social distancing at the best of times, and maybe one person in three every winter wears a mask (to protect others from sneezes and coughs). My neighbors are so used to hardship and obedience that no one registers any impatience as another long line of sightseers forms outside the Kyoto temple called Kurodani and each has her temperature scanned by a high-tech screen, is asked to buy a paper bag for carrying around her shoes (reusable plastic might carry infection) and sprays her hands with sanitizer before disappearing into a maple-filled garden.<br />Even this spring, when the pandemic first closed many places down, domestic tourists were thronging the tree-lined walks along Kyoto’s Philosopher’s Path, marveling at the cherry blossoms. In April, my 88-year-old mother was released from a hospital back in California, and I had to fly over to take care of her. Now, after more than six months away, I’m back in my adopted home of 33 years, just in time for fall’s brilliant festivals of goodbye.<br />Some things certainly look different these days, though Japan’s constant changes on the surface don’t often mean much change at its core. I returned to find the supermarket next to our apartment swathed in scaffolding. Our nearest big train station had been expanded so dramatically I could no longer orient myself. Our favorite Californian cafe here was gone. But people in Japan have long specialized in putting a bright face on things—in public at least—if only because 20 typhoons sweep through every year and the ground is often shaking with previews of the next earthquake.<br />So what strikes me most is what hasn’t changed. My first morning back, I saw a woman showing off a huge radish she’d just picked up from a neighbor’s barn, after leaving the equivalent of a dollar in a wooden box. The trees along the lanes were bright with tangerines and persimmons. Crows were perched among the apple-colored leaves, waiting to pounce on garbage bags left out in the street for collection. A man at our local shrine, first constructed in 1552, was joining his hands in silent prayer, though the worn rope used to ring a bell to summon the gods was tethered, in deference to the virus.

      <td>The Atlanta clergyman often sounds more like a transnational leftist than an American politician.</td>
      <td>The Middle East poses a problem for the Democrats. Theirs was traditionally the pro-Israel party and still commands the support of a substantial majority of Jewish voters. But left-liberal orthodoxy demands that all right-thinking people take the side of the Palestinians against the Israeli government and hold Jerusalem to a double standard: If any other nation takes an aggressive stance against terrorist insurrectionists or other internal threats, the results may be tragic but are kept in perspective. If Israel does so, it has committed a moral outrage and broken international law.<br />If you aspire to higher office as a Democrat, you’re expected to sympathize with that view of things but not to adopt it too stridently. You can condemn Israel for measures it has adopted to counter the indiscriminate killing of its civilians by terrorists, but you have to couch it all in pro-Israel rhetoric, always emphasizing Israel’s “right to defend itself,” as if any country could reasonably be said to lack that right.<br />Most Democratic candidates have negotiated the problem reasonably well, although extreme anti-Israel outliers from safe districts, such as Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, can occasion some awkwardness for their congressional colleagues. The problem for Raphael Warnock, the Democratic Senate candidate in Georgia’s special-election runoff Jan. 5, is that he didn’t start trying to negotiate it until very recently. He is a pastor whose weekly sermons at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta are recorded and available online, and he is the sort of left-wing clergyman who likes to make political pronouncements and to sign high-minded political statements.<br />He signed one such statement, composed in 2019 under the auspices of the National Council of Churches, after visiting Israel and the Palestinian territories with a group of black American and South African clergymen. The statement compared Israel’s border wall to the Berlin Wall and drew indirect but invidious analogies to apartheid, slavery and Nazism. The statement also included melodramatic language about the plight of Palestinians (“we are cut up by the misery in which poor families in Palestine have to survive”) and showed no awareness that these conditions are a consequence of Palestinians’ refusal to reject, and indeed insistence on using, murder as a political tool.<br />Sen. Kelly Loeffler’s campaign has underscored this and similar statements as evidence of Mr. Warnock’s radicalism. His response, in a written statement last month: “Claims that I believe Israel is an apartheid state are patently false—I do not believe that.”</td>

      <td>He never heard his own later works, but we’re still listening.</td>
      <td>Ludwig van Beethoven was born 250 years ago and baptized Dec. 17, 1770. Even those who don’t care for classical music recognize the opening bars of his Fifth Symphony. “Ode to Joy” from his Ninth brings tears to the eyes of listeners when “flash mobs” perform it. I’m a huge Beethoven fan and have been fortunate to hear both symphonies in concert.<br />Beethoven was resilient, innovative and gritty. His prodigious creativity left an enduring mark.<br />Amid 21st-century technological progress, the evolution of the piano in the late 18th century may seem quaint. But Beethoven took full advantage of the wider frequency and amplitude ranges this new instrument provided. The fortepiano—Italian for “loud soft”—was a major improvement on the harpsichord. Because the piano uses hammers to strike strings, players for the first time could vary a note’s volume.<br />Beethoven’s life is almost as inspiring as his music. He had an abusive, alcoholic father, Johann Beethoven, who often dragged his son from bed at night to practice at the keyboard. He so wanted Ludwig to be a child prodigy that he claimed the 7-year-old boy was only 6 when he gave his first recital. Johann felt he was in competition with Leopold Mozart, father of Wolfgang.<br />Beethoven was remarkably productive: His complete works fill 80 compact discs. The maximum disc playback length is 74 minutes, just long enough to accommodate the Ninth Symphony.</td>

In Stockholm, hospitals have nearly twice as many Covid-19 patients as they do intensive-care beds, said Bjorn Eriksson, the city’s health and medical care director.<br />On Monday, the country’s statistics agency said Sweden recorded 8,088 deaths from all causes last month, the second-deadliest month for the country of 10 million in its modern history, eclipsed only by the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918.<br />The increase in deaths and hospitalizations has already forced Sweden to set aside a policy of using voluntary measures to contain the virus, a strategy that has drawn global interest. By contrast, most European countries have used lockdowns and mandatory restrictions to contain the virus this year.</td>

      <td>“History shows us that it is best to tackle nonperforming loans early and decisively,” said European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, as he announced a plan for “bad banks” to sweep up debts soured by the pandemic.<br />But history also shows that Europe’s lenders aren’t likely to get much relief unless they actually find themselves in a nonperforming loan crisis.<br />The proposal announced by the European Union’s executive arm Wednesday supports creating national bad banks and a data hub for NPLs, while also pushing long-stalled proposals to harmonize debt recovery and insolvency rules. Officials are publicly acknowledging a key lesson from the 2008 crisis: Fast balance-sheet cleanup helped U.S. banks recover quickly, while European lenders struggled under a lingering hangover of bad loans.<br />But the plan stops far short of creating an EU-wide bad bank, as some had hoped.<br />The lack of ambition is lamentable but understandable. Commission proposals require signoff not just from the European parliament but also from Europe’s national leaders, who are often loath to approve anything that shares financial risk among them. The glacial pace of recent reform on the banking and capital market unions attests to the challenge. Unfortunately, that leaves Europe’s subscale banks struggling for profits among a patchwork of national and EU rules while competing with larger U.S. rivals.</td>

      <td>Disappointing retail sales report sets stage for a difficult winter, but new round of government support could ease the pain</td>
      <td>The Covid-19 crisis has caught back up with retailers again, setting the stage for a hard start to winter. But help may be on the way.<br />The Commerce Department on Wednesday reported that retail sales in November fell a seasonally adjusted 1.1% from the prior month, and adding to the insult revised its October sales level down as well. Typical holiday spending categories were among the worst hit, with sales down 3.5% at electronics and appliance stores, 6.8% at clothing and clothing accessories stores, and 7.7% at department stores. Sales at food services and drinking places fell 4%—an indication that the combination of colder weather crimping outdoor dining and stepped-up Covid-19 worries is hurting the restaurant sector.<br />The report suggests that the 4.1% annualized growth in fourth-quarter gross domestic product that economists polled by The Wall Street Journal forecast earlier this month may be too high. Moreover, because it also implies that the level of spending may be lower heading into the first quarter than many economists supposed, the average level of GDP in the first quarter may be lower relative to the fourth quarter than they forecast. As a result, their projection of 1.9% GDP growth in the first quarter also could be too high, with risk of an outright contraction that would send the economy into a double-dip recession.<br />Part of what makes the news disconcerting is that it comes during the holiday shopping season, which many small retailers in particular depend on. Fewer of them may be able to survive the winter, with negative repercussions for everything from commercial lending to the job market’s ability to recover.<br />Another worry is that apart from restaurants, the report reflects weakness in the goods sector, which is what has been driving the recovery since spring. As of October, consumer spending on goods was still 7.8% higher than in February, according to the Commerce Department, while spending in the far larger services sector was down 5.8%.</td>

      <td>Major League Baseball announced Wednesday that it was “correcting a longtime oversight in the game’s history” by elevating the Negro Leagues from 1920 through 1948 to major-league status, a move that recognizes the sport’s long-excluded Black pioneers and immediately rewrites baseball’s record books.<br />Roughly 3,400 Black and Latino players from seven distinct leagues, who were barred from joining the segregated National and American Leagues, will now be classified as “major-leaguers,” alongside white stars of the era. All statistics and records for those players will become part of MLB’s official history.<br />Before Jackie Robinson broke baseball’s color barrier for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, the Negro Leagues were the highest level of professional baseball open to Black players. Those leagues produced players who are considered among the most talented ever to step onto a field, including Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige and Oscar Charleston.<br />“All of us who love baseball have long known that the Negro Leagues produced many of our game’s best players, innovations and triumphs against a backdrop of injustice,” MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said.<br />Bob Kendrick, the president the president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Mo., called the move “historical validation for those who had been shunned from the major leagues and had the foresight and courage to create their own league that helped change the game and our country, too.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Treasury Department labeled Switzerland and Vietnam as currency manipulators on Wednesday, saying the two countries had intervened in foreign-exchange markets in a persistent, one-sided manner to limit appreciations of their currencies.<br />“The Treasury Department has taken a strong step today to safeguard economic growth and opportunity for American workers and businesses,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. “Treasury will follow up on its findings with respect to Vietnam and Switzerland to work toward eliminating practices that create unfair advantages for foreign competitors.”<br />Mr. Mnuchin’s statement accompanied the Treasury’s foreign-exchange report, which addresses the currency practices and macroeconomic policies of major U.S. trading partners. The report, typically released twice a year, is the Treasury’s primary vehicle for officially designating countries as currency manipulators.<br />The Treasury said it determined that at least part of both countries’ foreign-exchange intervention over the past four years had aimed to prevent effective balance of payment adjustments. The agency said Vietnam had also sought to gain unfair competitive advantage in international trade through its exchange-rate management.<br />The Treasury Department uses three criteria to assess whether a country manipulates its exchange rate: the extent of active intervention in currency markets; the size of trade surpluses with the U.S.; and the size of the country’s current-account surplus, a broader measure of trade that includes investment income and other financial flows.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Congressional leaders were closing in on a roughly $900 billion coronavirus relief deal expected to include another round of direct payments to households feeling the pain of the pandemic’s battering of the global economy, according to people familiar with the negotiations.<br />The package under discussion on Wednesday was expected to exclude the two thorniest issues: funding for state and local governments and liability protections for businesses and other entities operating during the pandemic, according to people familiar with the talks.<br />But congressional leaders were expected to add direct checks, potentially of a smaller size than the initial round, which provided $1,200 to individuals and $500 per dependent. Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R., S.D.) told reporters Wednesday he expected the checks would be in the $600 to $700 range per individual.<br />The package was also expected to include enhanced unemployment insurance, likely the $300 a week that a bipartisan group had proposed, Mr. Thune said. Congressional aides noted that the negotiations were continuing and no final agreement had been reached.<br />The overall cost of the package under discussion Wednesday was slightly under $900 billion, according to people familiar with the talks.</td>

So far in 2020, companies have raised more than $160 billion on U.S. exchanges, far exceeding the previous full-year record set at the height of the dot-com boom in 1999, according to Dealogic data that date to 1995.</td>

      <td>Two Canadian cannabis companies have agreed to merge, creating what they said would be the largest cannabis operation globally by revenue and potentially signaling more deals ahead among cannabis firms.<br />Aphria Inc.  and  Tilray Inc.  said Wednesday their proposed combination would create a company with annual revenue on a pro-forma basis of Canadian $874 million, equivalent to $686 million. The combined company would control 17% of the adult-use Canadian cannabis market by revenue, according to Raymond James, roughly double the shares of three other competitors.<br />The federal government in Canada legalized recreational use of cannabis in 2018, generating investment for new companies that cultivate the substance and sell it under various brand names. Corona beer brewer  Constellation Brands Inc.,  for example, has invested in  Canopy Growth Corp.  Some U.S. states allow people to use cannabis for medicinal uses or as a recreational product.<br />Canadian cannabis companies have at times struggled to generate profits as they navigate what is a relatively new consumer marketplace for publicly traded businesses and regulations across different areas.  Aurora Cannabis Inc.  said Wednesday that it had closed a facility and cut production at another, moves meant to improve cash flows.<br />The deal between Aphria and Tilray could signal more mergers and acquisitions ahead across the industry, according to some analysts. “We expect to see a building wave of consolidation among large and small cannabis players alike,” analysts at Raymond James said.</td>

The U.K. sends 43% of its exports to the bloc.<br />But in comments that echoed views of people involved in the negotiations, Mrs. von der Leyen checked off a series of issues where the two sides have narrowed or resolved differences linked to a central EU demand: that the U.K. commit to standards on issues such as state aid, labor and environmental regulation that will ensure fair competition once Britain leaves the bloc.<br />That includes progress on defining the rules around U.K. state-aid decisions and their enforcement, and the ability of the EU to take punitive action if the agreement is breached.</td>

It was a co-founder of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in 2017, and is run by an epidemiologist who warned in January that Covid-19 was much worse than everyone thought.<br />The £29 billion, or $39 billion, medical charity—Britain’s biggest foundation—piled on protection for 20% of its stock exposure using derivatives when the market was complacent about the danger, and has strongly outperformed global equities as a result.<br />This isn’t just a story about getting 2020 right, although Wellcome’s longstanding portfolio of growth stocks, including China’s Alibaba, Tencent and  JD.com ,  also did very well. Instead, this is about Wellcome’s decision back in 2018 to borrow at what was then the lowest rate ever for a corporate 100-year bond, to invest in (mostly) stocks.</td>

      <td>Come winter, both men and women encounter dry, parched skin. So we set out to uncover the most soothing, yet not sticky creams for all skin types and desires.</td>
      <td>WHEN THE weather turns cold, face cream becomes a skin care survival tool, an insulating layer that supplies moisture and prevents it from escaping. “The simple act of putting it on will make you look better,” said Boston dermatologist Ranella Hirsch of a rich cream’s immediate smoothing and plumping effects. Yet, the prospect of slathering on a robust formula often brings to mind the cold creams our grandmothers kept on their night tables—dense goop laden with mineral oil. That stuff, as Dr. Hirsch puts it, felt “repulsive” on the skin and mainly treated one type of skin: super dry.<br />Today, said Dr. Hirsch, we better understand the moisture barrier—the protective outermost layer of skin—and how to keep it resilient with more-sophisticated ingredients for every complexion type. Now you’ll find products whose labels list everything from weightless hyaluronic acids to non-greasy shea butters. But between the lotions, balms and gels, how do you find one that’s ultra-moisturizing but with a wearable, all-day texture? My solution was to test a bunch—50, to be exact. I have combination skin (dry cheeks, oily nose) and I’m a runner so my face frequently takes a beating from wind and snow, which can leave it chapped. I consider strong fragrance a major turnoff (though I appreciate subtle botanical whiffs). In my tests, I heeded Dr. Hirsch’s advice on how to apply creams properly (many of her patients don’t, she finds): To trap in moisture, she said, put it on damp skin, “ideally within a minute of washing your face.” (Also helpful: getting ambient moisture from a humidifier and giving up long, hot showers—I’m working on that).<br />Here, eight rich yet easily absorbed creams that exceeded my expectations and will get you through the depths of winter.<br />Once you try this intensely healing ointment, suitable for both face and body, you will never go back to the sticky alternatives. It absorbs incredibly easily into dry patches, without making you feel all lubed-up. from $8, vanicream.com.<br />Having SPF in your day cream means you don’t have to think about it—but you can spend considerable brainpower trying to find a mineral-based one that rubs in without chalky residue.

      <td>SUVs are getting too big—and too pricey. Kia’s sleeker midsize Sorento trims the fat without sacrificing the third-row seat, giving the middle class a break, says Dan Neil.</td>
      <td>THE 2021  Kia  Sorento is a midsize crossover with third-row seating. I find that utterly fascinating.<br />In the past I’ve complained about the spiraling size of SUVs and pickups, as auto makers and dealers push U.S. consumers into ever larger vehicles, because—at the risk of being reductive—they are more profitable. It would be easy for a small family to walk into a dealership and drive off with a full-size, three-row SUV, having blown their budget, convinced the third row will pay for itself in convenience over 72 months of car payments.<br />The emergence of midsize crossovers with third-row seats represents the counter trend in consumer preference: right-sizing. Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Mazda CX-9, Subaru Ascent, GMC Acadia, VW Atlas, Nissan Pathfinder. All now have third-row seating options, formerly the exclusive domain of L- and XL-sized vehicles. All are cheaper to buy, feed and maintain than the full-size brand alternative.<br />Example: Kia’s own Telluride SUV is 7.9 inches longer and about $2,600 more than the new Sorento. The Telluride is well priced and well reviewed, and has the option of seven or eight seats. But for buyers who foresee using these seats only sparingly, the midsize option may pencil out better, now that it’s here.<br />As was inscribed at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Know thyself, carbuyers. Those two or three extra seats could cost a lot, or a little. How often do you expect to have more than five people in your car; how old will they be; and how comfortable, for how long? Kids are bendy. I’ve owned a seven-passenger minivan for years. I can’t remember the last time every seat was filled. And yet car buyers are often consumed with fears of “What if?” Third-row seats, bike racks, multi-mode vehicle dynamics, launch control, paddle shifters, low-range 4x4, seat massagers, 300-mile EV range: just a few of the features people pay scads for and use rarely, if ever. Third-row seats are like gym memberships.</td>

StockX has now raised $490 million through private investors.<br />StockX Chief Executive Scott Cutler, a former executive at eBay Inc. and the New York Stock Exchange, said in an interview that the company was profitable for the first time in the third quarter, with revenue rising 75% year over year.

      <td>With so much uncertainty, let’s embrace a policy agenda that is premised on curiosity</td>
      <td>As the debate over big tech and antitrust intensified over the past year, certainty reigned.<br />On one side are those who are certain that companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are monopolies, dominant in individual markets like search, social networking, e-commerce and app stores. They are certain that mergers between companies like Facebook and Instagram reduced competition. And they’re certain that antitrust law has calcified, unable to account for new technologies. As a recent report by the House Judiciary Committee claimed, “companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups…have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons.”<br />On the other side of the debate are those who are certain that competition is flourishing in the tech sector, with innovation yielding great products at ever-lower prices, and companies like TikTok and Snap emerging to challenge incumbents. They are certain that mergers have benefited consumers. And they’re certain that we don’t need to re-examine antitrust doctrine because it’s flexible enough to evolve with technology.<br />In the course of this debate, I’ve espoused my own certainties. When I worked for Facebook, it never felt like we could afford to be complacent. We faced real competitive threats. If I had shown up at a meeting and announced that Facebook didn’t compete with Google, Apple or TikTok, I would have been laughed out of the room. And I saw Facebook’s investment in developing new features for its Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions and improving the safety, security and infrastructure of both products. So it’s hard for me to reconcile my experience in the tech sector with the antitrust arguments now being waged against it.<br />But if November’s election taught us anything, it’s that our assumptions are often wrong. With polls predicting a blue-wave election that never materialized, predictions that seemed certain before the election now seem flimsy in the wake of it.</td>

      <td>Moves by high-profile companies to Texas from California are likely to improve the personal finances of executives and offer employees more affordable housing—but make little difference to the firms’ tax bills.<br />Oracle Corp.  and  Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co.  are the latest big corporations to announce moves to the Lone Star State. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc., is also moving to Texas, and the electric car company is expanding there.<br />The announcements have highlighted the vastly different tax and regulatory systems in the country’s two most populous states. California relies more on taxing personal income, particularly of high-income households, and operates a growing regulatory structure. Texas leans on more regressive property and sales taxes and boasts a more laissez-faire environment. The biggest difference: High-paid executives who move can see their state income-tax bills go from 13.3% to nothing.<br />But corporate investors hoping for big tax and other savings may need to temper their enthusiasm. Business-tax considerations are likely to prove secondary at best, tax and economic-development experts say. They are dwarfed by the allure of more-affordable housing, lower cost of living and lighter regulatory burdens.<br />For companies, much of the difference between California and Texas boils down to ease and cost of hiring—not just now but down the road.</td>

      <td>Mayor Anne Hidalgo appointed 11 women and five men to senior roles at city hall in 2018, and now has to pay a $110,000 fine</td>
      <td>The city government of Paris has been dealt an unlikely punishment: a fine of 90,000 euros, equivalent to $110,000, for appointing too many women to senior positions and breaking France’s gender-equality rules.<br />The offense dates back to 2018, when Mayor Anne Hidalgo appointed 11 women and five men to her senior team at a time when administrations around the world were trying to increase female representation in governments. But with 69% of the positions going to women and 31% to men, Paris broke national government rules to promote equality, which require that at least 40% of new positions should be allocated to each gender.<br />A waiver was introduced in 2019 if the new hires didn’t lead to a broader gender imbalance. That would seem to be the case for Paris, where women account for just under a half of senior officials in city hall. But the initial round of appointments predated the waiver, meaning the Paris government was still on the hook.<br />Ms. Hidalgo told a meeting of the city council on Tuesday that the appointments helped give women a louder voice in government in France and, with tongue in cheek, said she was delighted to pay the fine.<br />“In Paris, we are doing everything to make it a success, and I am very proud of a large team of women and men who together carry this fight for equality,” Ms. Hidalgo said.</td>

      <td>The European Union unveiled plans to assist countries in setting up a network of national “bad banks” to help cope with a possible avalanche of defaulted loans triggered by the pandemic.<br />Bad banks—private or government funded repositories that soak up soured loans—are seen as a way to help Europe’s creaky banks navigate the Covid-19 downturn and be strong enough to lend during the recovery. The European Central Bank, which supervises the largest banks in the eurozone, has warned banks could be facing $1.7 trillion in bad loans under an extreme, yet possible, economic scenario.<br />The proposal for the bad banks announced Wednesday by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, underscores its limits in trying to create EU-wide solutions that all member states can agree on. The effort would rely on individual governments to sponsor the bad banks, falling short of more ambitious proposals for a continentwide bad bank.<br />Banks in the south of Europe, such as Italy, Spain and Greece, tend to see a surge in loan defaults during economic downturns. The issue is less severe in richer northern European countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, which have blamed individual countries and their banks for their troubles.<br />Bad loans have been a big problem for the bloc since the sovereign-debt crisis in 2011, when banks choked on mountains of defaulted loans, hurting profits and their ability to lend. Banks were still cleaning up their balance sheets when the coronavirus pandemic hit.</td>

      <td>Consumers across income brackets use savings to splurge on high-end items; three $10,000 watches, ‘gilt gifting’</td>
      <td>Shoppers have a new mantra this year: Treat yourself.<br />Stuck at home and spending far less on travel, experiences and dining out, consumers are trading up on everything from designer handbags to diamond jewelry, according to industry executives and market-research firms.<br />The splurging defies the norms of past economic downturns, when consumers traded down to less-expensive items. And it isn’t only the well-off taking part. Less-affluent shoppers are buying items like premium spaghetti sauce or salon-worthy shampoo that was previously out of reach or thought to be not worth the price before the coronavirus pandemic forced people to curtail activities and isolate.<br />Stephanie Moon bought a Chloé handbag on sale for $600 this summer as a reward for signing her first client to her newly launched consulting firm. The 38-year-old San Francisco resident said she doesn’t usually buy designer bags, but felt like she could afford one now.<br />“I’m saving so much money, because I’m not going anywhere or doing anything,” she said. “Normally, I’d treat myself to a night out with my girlfriends, but that wasn’t an option this year.”</td>

      <td>The wildly popular trading platform exposed Massachusetts investors to ‘unnecessary trading risks,’ according to the complaint</td>
      <td>Massachusetts securities regulators are expected to file a complaint Wednesday against the wildly popular trading platform operated by Robinhood Financial LLC, alleging the company aggressively marketed to inexperienced investors and failed to implement controls to protect them.<br />In a final draft of a more than 20-page administrative complaint reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the enforcement arm of the Massachusetts Securities Division said Robinhood failed to protect its customers and their assets, violating state laws and regulations. Robinhood exposed Massachusetts investors to “unnecessary trading risks” by “falling far short of the fiduciary standard” adopted this year that requires broker-dealers to act in their clients’ best interest, the state said.<br />A Robinhood spokeswoman said the company hadn’t seen the complaint but will continue to work closely with all regulators.<br />“Robinhood has opened up financial markets for a new generation of people who were previously excluded,” she said. “We are committed to operating with integrity, transparency, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”<br />The complaint from the office of William Galvin, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, marks the latest round of scrutiny that the popular brokerage has faced in its short history. Since it was founded less than a decade ago, Robinhood has exploded in popularity, amassing more than 13 million customer accounts. Traders tend to be drawn to the user-friendly platform that allows customers to trade securities like stocks for free.</td>
