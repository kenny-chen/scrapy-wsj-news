      <td>Cruise operator says it seeks to focus on core brands as it works to resume operations that had been halted due to Covid-19</td>
      <td>Royal Caribbean  Group said it is selling its Azamara luxury cruise line for $201 million in cash to private-equity firm Sycamore Partners, a move that would let the company focus on core operations after almost a year since onboard coronavirus outbreaks brought voyages to a halt in the U.S.<br />The divestment is the latest downsizing move by a cruise company during the Covid-19 pandemic as operators look for additional sources of cash. Royal Caribbean Finance Chief Jason Liberty said the deal wasn’t driven by financial reasons and that it had considered selling the brand before the health crisis.<br />The company will seek to expand its core Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea brands after the sale, according to Royal Caribbean, which also operates TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises under a joint venture. Under the transaction, expected to close in the first quarter, Sycamore will acquire Azamara’s three ships and intellectual property such as the brand’s logo and slogan, the company added.<br />Royal Caribbean in December said it sold two ships in its Royal Caribbean International fleet. The company will come out of the deal with three fewer ships than its 61-ship fleet in 2019 after taking two ship deliveries and exiting a joint venture for Pullmantur Cruceros, which filed for reorganization under Spanish insolvency laws in 2020, a spokesman said.<br />“It allows us to really prioritize our resources, which are not just financial resources—it’s also the minds and time of management,” Mr. Liberty told The Wall Street Journal.</td>

      <td>Many developers look at failing malls and envision modern office campuses, bustling warehouses or residential buildings. But some are finding that converting these shopping centers isn’t so easy.<br />Repurposing a mall is expensive. New owners typically need to shell out hundreds of millions of dollars on construction and labor, developers and brokers say.<br />Razing and redeveloping a space that spans dozens of football fields is filled with potential land mines. The new investor may own the mall but not the department stores or parcels in the parking lot, which means an owner needs their approval. Owners will also need to seek rezoning and entitlements permits that can take years, during which economic conditions can deteriorate.<br />Consequently, many recent conversion efforts have gone awry, forcing the owner to sell the property at a discount. In other cases, local government authorities have lost patience and bought the owners out.<br />Brookfield Property Partners  LP has made converting all or part of malls one of its prime real-estate strategies. In 2018, the firm bought the two-thirds of mall operator GGP Inc. it didn’t already own, valuing GGP’s property portfolio at around $15 billion. The acquisition reflected Brookfield’s confidence in the mall-conversion strategy, but the real-estate investor has often struggled to make this approach work.</td>

Revenue of $11.74 billion was 18% above 2019’s fourth-quarter level. Both measures were much better than the expectations of analysts polled by FactSet, who forecast profit of $7.39 a share on revenue of $9.99 billion.<br />Full-year revenue at Goldman of $44.56 billion was the most since 2009, while annual trading revenue reached a 10-year high.<br />For the U.S. banking industry, 2020 was a roller-coaster year. Markets plunged and economic activity declined in the spring as the coronavirus spread across the country. With many businesses closed and many consumers out of work, banks girded themselves for widespread defaults. A robust federal spending program helped forestall the worst-case economic scenario, and in earnings reports last week, bank executives signaled the economy has held up better than expected.<br />On Friday,  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. said fourth-quarter profit soared 42% to a record $12.14 billion after the bank released $2.9 billion from its stockpile of funds previously set aside to cover soured loans. On Tuesday,  Bank of America Corp.  said profit fell 22% but topped analysts’ expectations after it released $828 million from its loan-loss reserves.</td>

Tricked out with high-lift cranes and an upgraded positioning system, it started servicing the U.K.’s offshore wind farms in 2019.<br />Atlantic Discovery is one of a growing number of vessels catering to offshore wind farms, which are proliferating as the world reduces its reliance on fossil fuels. The need to finance the ships has lured money managers chasing investments that check the environmentally friendly box and provide yield. Their interest suggests appetite for cleaner investments extends beyond the ubiquitous green bonds of recent years.<br />Ships clear the seabed of debris, lay foundations and build turbines—often far from shore in treacherous conditions. A financing gap exists because banks have pulled back from the shipping industry after losses since the 2008-09 financial crisis.<br />Galya Petkova sees this in her job at Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA, leasing vessels to service turbines. She is encountering more private funds that own or finance ships compared with three years ago, she says.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—When Gen. Lloyd Austin appears before the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday, he will be one of the few members of President-elect Joe Biden’s team with deep military experience to help him confront threats around the world, his advisers said.<br />At the same time, the Army officer with 41 years of military service will have to persuade those same lawmakers he can lead the Pentagon with the perspective of a civilian.<br />The modern Defense Department was designed to have a civilian leader and a team of senior uniformed officers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, advising the president. Because of that, the law requires Gen. Austin, who retired from the U.S. Army in 2016, to receive a waiver from Congress to hold the job of secretary of defense, in addition to winning the Senate confirmation required of most cabinet-level appointees.<br />“Lloyd is very cognizant that he is coming in as a political appointee,” said a person familiar with his preparations for the confirmation hearings. “He knows that he is going to be a civilian, politically appointed official in the Biden cabinet, and he’s comfortable taking on that new role. He has to make it clear he is not a general.”<br />Laws safeguarding civilian control of the military require the top Pentagon civilian job to be held by someone out of uniform for seven years, unless Congress votes to waive the rule. Gen. Austin, 67, would become the second recent Pentagon leader to require a congressional waiver, following retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, who was President Trump’s first defense secretary.</td>

Changes in equity value result both from firm investment decisions and changes in market valuations.<br />Hotels account for 7% of the equity value, down from 23% in 2015.

      <td>Chinese robotics companies took market share last year amid the disruptions of the pandemic</td>
      <td>Covid-19 has accelerated automation in factories, especially in manufacturing powerhouse China. Foreign companies have long dominated the market for industrial robots and automation tools there—but there are signs that dominance is fraying around the edges.<br />As the factory for the world, China is unsurprisingly far and away the largest market for industrial robots. Before the pandemic, however, the U.S.-China trade war was slowing growth. New installations of industrial robots amounted to 140,500 in 2019, a 9% decline from the previous year, but still almost three times the number for second-place Japan, according to the International Federation of Robotics. Last year was likely much better:  Credit Suisse  estimates that China’s industrial-robotics market grew 9.5% in 2020.<br />Covid-19 initially shut down factories in China, but as the country gradually got the pandemic under control, demand for automation equipment bounced back. Surging sales for consumer electronics and electric vehicles have also driven demand for automation products.<br />Foreign companies like Japan’s  Fanuc  and Europe’s  ABB  control nearly three-quarters of China’s industrial-robot market, according to Citi. But hopes are running high in China that the government will push more strongly for local content in the robotics and automation supply chain. Stocks of Chinese automation companies have rallied. Shares in  Shenzhen Inovance Technology ,  for example, have tripled since the beginning of 2020. Industrial robot maker  Estun Automation ’s  shares have also rallied.<br />Some Chinese automation-equipment companies won market share last year as Covid-19 disrupted supply chains for foreign rivals. Citi estimates Inovance’s China market share in servo motors, which are used to control precise movements, has jumped to more than 16% in 2020, against 11% in 2019 and 3% in 2013. The company also recorded strong growth in its electric-vehicle motor business, which shares some similarities with servo motors. The company’s net profit nearly doubled year-over-year in the first nine months of 2020.</td>

      <td>TORONTO—Canadian and U.S. officials are at odds over the fate of a pipeline underneath the Great Lakes, exacerbating disagreements over energy policy between the two nations as the Biden administration prepares to take office.<br />Citing environmental concerns, Michigan state officials have told  Enbridge Inc.  to close its Line 5 pipeline, which carries more than half a million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids each day from Superior, Wis. to Sarnia, Ontario. Canadian officials say closing the pipeline would choke off more than half of the supply used to make gasoline, jet fuel and home-heating oil for the most populous parts of the country. The 645-mile pipeline, which is part of Enbridge’s mainline system that conveys oil and natural gas liquids from Alberta, feeds refineries in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Ontario and Quebec.<br />“Pipelines are so vital to the economy and the recovery,” said Chris Bloomer president of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, a trade group. “We’re hoping for some pragmatism.”<br />The dispute adds another point of conflict in the energy relationship between the U.S. and Canada. Officials, companies and environmentalists in both countries have clashed in recent years over how to balance energy security with environmental concerns.<br />President-elect Joe Bien’s team has said that he opposes a proposed extension of  TC Energy Corp.’s  Keystone pipeline, which would carry oil from Alberta to Nebraska. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has long advocated for the extension, has said it would be a key issue between the two countries during Mr. Biden’s tenure. Canadian officials said they expect Mr. Biden to stick with his plans to scrap the project.</td>

      <td>Office Depot  rebuffed an unsolicited takeover offer from Staples but indicated it is open to an alternative deal, the latest twist in a yearslong dance between the office-supply retailers.<br />Staples on Jan. 11 proposed to buy Office Depot’s parent, ODP Corp., for more than $2 billion or $40 a share. Staples said it would pursue a public tender offer for ODP’s shares in March if the companies don’t reach agreement on a deal.<br />ODP has concluded that a sale of its retail and consumer-facing e-commerce operations to Staples or a joint venture is preferable to a full takeover, according to a letter sent by ODP’s chairman to an official of the private-equity firm that controls Staples. It said in the letter, seen by The Wall Street Journal, that such a deal would afford the same cost savings as a full-company sale but be less likely to attract prolonged regulatory scrutiny.<br />Staples’ recent bid marks the third time it has tried to acquire its main bricks-and-mortar rival. Previous efforts, including a $6.3 billion proposal five years ago, were blocked by antitrust enforcers. Staples was taken private by Sycamore Partners in 2017 and is now controlled by a subsidiary of the buyout firm called USR Parent Inc.<br />In a sign that investors anticipate a deal of some sort, ODP shares have climbed 24% since USR disclosed its bid, closing at $45.86 Friday. A tie-up of the office-suppliers’ retail operations could generate significant cost-savings if the combined company reduces its footprint by closing overlapping stores.</td>

Many individuals bought the funds via Alipay, the popular payments and financial-services app owned by Ant. The Hangzhou-based company had earlier struck agreements to allocate a portion of its Shanghai IPO to the funds, which told investors they would also invest in other stocks.<br />Ant, which is controlled by billionaire Jack Ma, on Nov. 3 suspended plans to list in both Hong Kong and Shanghai after coming under pressure from Chinese officials and financial regulators. At the time, domestic and international investors had committed more than $34 billion to its IPOs, and their funds were subsequently returned.<br />Investors in the five mutual funds earlier agreed to lock up their money for 18 months. After Ant’s IPO was suspended, a public outcry ensued, and the asset managers agreed to let investors withdraw their money between Nov. 23 and Dec. 22 without incurring transaction fees.<br />Regulatory filings from the funds over the weekend showed that nearly 2.6 million individuals have exited their investments, reducing the mutual funds’ assets under management by a third on average.</td>

      <td>Best explanation for how stocks have moved so far this year is the raw price of the stock, an almost meaningless number</td>
      <td>Sometimes it’s hard to argue that market capitalism has any chance of correctly allocating money to the companies that can use it best. Case in point: Stock-market performance this year has been driven by the raw share price, with lower-priced stocks doing better and higher-priced worse.<br />Forget a careful evaluation of future cash flow, valuation, brand power, management skill or even political sensitivity. I repeat: The best explanation for how stocks have moved so far this year is the price of the stock, an almost meaningless number.<br />Stocks priced below $1 have performed the best, followed by those between $1 and $2, and so on up almost perfectly. The worst performers have share prices above $100. It looks remarkably like investors are treating a low-price share as an indicator that the stock is a bargain, and a higher price as a sign that it is worse value for money.<br />The share price on its own carries virtually no useful information: It depends entirely on how many shares the company has issued. A company can split a high priced stock to create more at a lower price, without making any difference to the intrinsic worth of the company. Equally, it can consolidate its shares to reduce the number, increasing the share price but again without any effect on how much the company should be worth.<br />The fact that the stock price at the start of the year is a near-perfect determinant of how a stock has performed is depressing, but at least in part explainable.</td>

      <td>Online platform combines all of retail’s hottest trends, but growth could be costly</td>
      <td>Just when you thought e-commerce couldn’t get any hotter,  Poshmark  wants to be the life of the party.<br />The online platform, which calls itself a social shopping marketplace, saw its shares more than double in their public debut on Thursday. After a tumble Friday, Poshmark’s market value is still over $5 billion, more than a fifth of that of pandemic darling  Etsy ,  despite posting less than 12% of that company’s profit in the third quarter of last year.<br />Etsy’s shares have more than quadrupled over the past year, benefiting not only from stellar sales growth as an online marketplace but also from a pandemic-driven boom in mask sales.<br />Assuming the e-commerce frenzy in the market keeps up, Poshmark could do it one better. At its core, the platform similarly enables individuals and small businesses to market and sell goods online. But it also adds a social network aspect, incorporating likes, comments, shares and other connections through “Posh parties.” Even better, it is generally known for being a secondhand marketplace, playing into perhaps today’s hottest trend in fashion—sustainability. The U.S. online secondhand market is projected to grow 69% between 2019 and 2021, while the broader retail market shrinks 15%, according to a 2020 report from secondhand e-tail company thredUp, citing third party analytics firm GlobalData.<br />Relative to competitors, Poshmark seems to have several advantages. While it does offer personalized curation, it doesn’t hold inventory like thredUp,  RealReal  or Stitch Fix do. An asset-light model means it can quickly pivot, for example from promoting workwear to athleisure, based on changing retail trends. And its sellers don’t have to be as skilled as Etsy’s. Only so many people can handcraft jewelry or home décor; almost everyone has a piece or two of halfway decent clothing forgotten in their closet.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Janet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden’s choice for Treasury secretary, will urge lawmakers in her confirmation hearing Tuesday to “act big” to avert a protracted economic downturn and put aside concerns about the mounting national debt.<br />“Economists don’t always agree, but I think there is a consensus now: Without further action, we risk a longer, more painful recession now—and long-term scarring of the economy later,” Ms. Yellen says in the text of remarks to the Senate Finance Committee as reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, unveiled last week, provides for another round of direct stimulus payments, extended and enhanced jobless benefits, funding for schools and first responders and the creation of a nationwide vaccination program. The proposal also includes longstanding Democratic priorities, such as raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding paid leave for workers.<br />Republicans have decried the size and scope of the measure, arguing it would spend more than the economy needs. Some Republicans and Democrats have also expressed concern about the growing national debt, which at $21.6 trillion exceeds the annual output of the U.S. economy.<br />Ms. Yellen aims to address those concerns in her testimony: “Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country’s debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big.”</td>

Many of those peddling the new poultry items are better known as hamburger chains, including  McDonald’s Corp. ,  Shake Shack Inc.  and  Jack in the Box Inc.<br />Restaurant operators, grappling with slowdowns and restrictions brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, aim to capture consumers’ enthusiasm for crispy, breaded-chicken sandwiches. That fervor helped build Chick-fil-A Inc. into one of the nation’s top fast-food chains over the past decade, and made Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc.’s offering a social-media sensation after its 2019 debut.<br />The chicken-sandwich war, as industry competitors describe it, means diners have lots of options—such as a Korean-style iteration at Shake Shack, a McDonald’s version topped with spicy pepper sauce and a new KFC offering that the chain bills as its “best chicken sandwich ever.” The sandwich craze also might bring lasting changes to the restaurant business, with owners spending thousands of dollars on new equipment for battering chicken filets to compete for what some franchisees say is the future of eating out.<br />Shake Shack began selling its new fried-chicken sandwich in the burger chain’s South Korean restaurants during the fall, before it made its debut in the U.S. this month. One of the first limited-time items it put on menus during the pandemic was a spicy chicken sandwich, also during the fall.</td>

      <td>Hopes for an economic rebound and a slowdown in borrowing have powered U.S. corporate bonds to a strong start in 2021.<br />As of Thursday, the average extra yield, or spread, investors demanded to hold investment-grade corporate bonds over U.S. Treasurys was 0.93 percentage points, according to Bloomberg Barclays data. That was down from 1.05 percentage points one month ago and the narrowest gap since January 2020.<br />The move reflects investors’ growing confidence that highly rated U.S. companies will endure the pandemic, boosted by vaccine rollouts, economic stimulus and easy money from the Federal Reserve. Spreads had widened sharply during 2020’s early year market turmoil, when many investors feared the pandemic would spark a wave of defaults and bankruptcies, fueling losses in corporate debt.<br />The Fed’s intervention, which included cutting interest rates and buying billions of dollars worth of bonds, helped fuel a recovery. With rates near zero, investors chased extra yield in the investment-grade market, helping companies refinance their debt at lower interest rates and raise record amounts of cash to protect balance sheets from the pandemic’s blows.<br />Now Wall Street economists are projecting a pickup in economic growth later in 2021 as vaccination efforts accelerate. Investment-grade mutual and exchange-traded funds have taken in more than $12 billion this year as of Jan. 13, according to Refinitiv Lipper, after posting the largest one-year inflow ever in 2020.</td>

      <td>LONDON—The global coronavirus pandemic has intensified the rivalry between the U.S. and China, increasing future instability in international diplomatic relations, according to an annual report on global risks from the World Economic Forum.<br />The report, which draws on opinions of hundreds of executives and academics associated with the WEF, as well as risk-management specialists, says the pandemic threatens to widen income and other disparities within and between societies, increasing the risks of a further fracturing inside some states and in international relations.<br />Covid-19 “has entrenched state power and intensified rivalry between the United States and China,” the report says, forcing other powers to choose sides.<br />“With some alliances weakening, diplomatic relationships will become more unstable at points where superpower tectonic plates meet or withdraw,” it says. This trend has been accentuated as a lack of face-to-face discussions have hurt traditional diplomacy.<br />The report is usually published just ahead of the WEF’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. This year, the meeting has been postponed because of the pandemic until May, when it will take place in Singapore. Next week, the forum is organizing a virtual meeting that includes addresses from leaders such as China’s Xi Jinping and India’s Narendra Modi.</td>

      <td>Recent ructions in U.S. government bond markets have revived discussions of a potential “taper tantrum,” mirroring the expectations of a sudden rise in interest rates that came in 2013 as the Federal Reserve signaled its intention to cut back its enormous bond-buying program.<br />At the time, the news took investors by surprise and rocked emerging markets. There is less prospect of that this time: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says he wants the Fed to signal any tapering well in advance.<br />But just as important, developing markets look better insulated than in 2013.<br />It wasn’t just the taper tantrum itself that mattered for emerging markets but the currency-market shifts during the subsequent year. The ICE Dollar Index rose by as much as 25% from the spring of 2014 to the spring of 2015. That surge disrupted years of planning by corporations and governments, which had anticipated a relatively weak dollar, something that seemed like the new normal for almost a decade.<br />That wouldn’t be the case today. For one, the dollar’s decline in 2020 was far smaller than its mid-2000s plunge. A similar climb would take the dollar into rarefied territory seen only between 2000 and 2002. That isn’t impossible but doesn’t seem likely.</td>

Mr. Bachelier also donated another $272,000 to other right-wing causes—again using bitcoin—giving more than $17,000 to the social-media platform Gab, and a similar amount to the anti-immigration website VDARE.com, according to the report.<br />Weeks later, Mr. Fuentes and some of his supporters were part of the crowd at President Trump’s rally before the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to researchers who have been studying the event and its participants.<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation is exploring potential foreign sources of funding for far-right groups in the wake of the Capitol riots, and the agency has been briefed on Mr. Bachelier’s donations, according to people familiar with the matter.</td>

He said he would have left earlier, but a transition official for President-elect Joe Biden invited him to continue serving as bureau director, and “under other circumstances” he would have been honored to stay in his post under the new president.<br />Mr. Dillingham’s resignation comes after the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General issued a memo that raised concerns about his directive for career officials to produce a report that “includes data on documented and undocumented persons in the United States.” Career officials said they were “under significant pressure to produce this technical report,” the OIG memo said.<br />The memo inquired how Mr. Dillingham would ensure the data quality of the report and why the Census Bureau director prioritized the report.<br />Mr. Dillingham addressed the inspector general’s memo at length in his resignation announcement. Mr. Dillingham defended the data request and said it “was not an attempt to release 2020 census data results for apportionment early.”</td>

      <td>As the Trump Presidency ends in the disgrace of the Capitol riot, an effort is already underway to erase everything in the last four years as disgraceful too. That’s a lie—a Big Lie, to borrow the cliché of the moment. Donald Trump’s profound character flaws need to be separated from what so many people in his Administration accomplished for the country.<br />These men and women didn’t “enable” Donald Trump. Sixty-three million Americans did that when they elected him in 2016, with a significant assist from the Democrats who nominated Hillary Clinton, perhaps the only candidate who could have lost to Mr. Trump.<br />Mr. Trump appointed people who had the usual varying combinations of conviction and ambition. They served despite the hostility of the bureaucracy and press, and a President who often didn’t appreciate their work. Sometimes—in some cases, often—they protected the country by stopping Mr. Trump from his worst impulses.<br />We can’t list everyone who contributed, but before the Biden Presidency begins we thought we’d link some of those who did their jobs well with the successful policies they promoted. We’ve already saluted Betsy DeVos at Education and Ajit Pai at the Federal Communications Commission. Here’s a sample of other significant people and policies:<br />• Larry Kudlow, Kevin Hassett, Casey Mulligan, Gary Cohn, and others on the economic team. The pandemic-lockdown recession has obscured that the pre-Covid U.S. economy was the strongest since the 1990s. Unlike the Obama years, the benefits of growth were widely dispersed, wage gains were strongest for the least skilled, and poverty saw its sharpest decline in decades.</td>

      <td>But formidable global challenges await Joe Biden as he moves into the White House.</td>
      <td>Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Ali Khamenei, Nicolás Maduro and Kim Jong Un doubtless were gleefully munching their popcorn as the violent fringe of a large pro-Trump demonstration stormed the halls of Congress earlier this month. The rioting in Washington and the militarization of the capital for this week’s inauguration telegraph American instability and weakness—something that cheered every U.S. adversary and alarmed every friend around the world.<br />That said, the national and global doom-mongering is overdone. President Trump’s false claims and incendiary rhetoric ignited an ugly incident, not a constitutional crisis. Mr. Trump is too weak and American democracy too strong for any other result. Fundamental U.S. constitutional structures were never in peril. Up and down the line, state election officials from both parties followed the appropriate procedures, at times in the face of bullying and threats.<br />Distinguished lawyers of impeccable Republican and conservative credentials declined to lend their reputations to the weak claims that the president’s campaign sought to litigate. And when those cases came up for judicial scrutiny, courts filled with Trump appointees decided them according to the law. Even those representatives and senators who failed in their duty by echoing the president’s unfounded, inflammatory claims did so secure in the knowledge that their cynical grandstanding wouldn’t overturn the legal process. The American military’s commitment to constitutional order never wavered.<br />The weary capital could still see more violence on Inauguration Day, but the republic stands. The momentary frenzy of a mob or the histrionic demagoguery of a defeated president and his most opportunistic allies notwithstanding, there has not been a moment when there was a real possibility that Mr. Trump’s term of office would extend past its constitutionally mandated close.<br />Counterintuitively, the real message of the 2020 election is that the U.S. remains strong. Voters elected, electors voted, and the transfer of power proceeds apace. A perfect storm—a destructive pandemic, an economic maelstrom, a crisis in race relations, a bitter election campaign and, in the end, the effort of a defeated president to foment all the trouble he could—still couldn’t prevent the constitutional process from taking its course.</td>

      <td>Since 2003, two activist judges on the Third Circuit have been arbitrarily stalling FCC innovation.</td>
      <td>Two judges on the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals have spent the past 17 years blocking a congressionally mandated modernization of antiquated broadcast-television regulations. The Supreme Court will hear an appeal Tuesday, FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, giving broadcasters the chance to be unshackled from restrictions this activist court continues to impose on them—which are contrary to court precedent and statute and make no sense in light of the competition from digital media.<br />At stake are Federal Communications Commission rules that would allow broadcasters to compete more efficiently against less-regulated tech companies, invest more in local news gathering, and strengthen their position as a crucial conduit for free speech.<br />Decades ago, over-the-air broadcast television was the dominant medium on which Americans relied for news, weather and entertainment. To curb broadcasters’ clout, in the mid-20th century the FCC heavily regulated the industry and limited how many TV stations a single owner could have. Congress saw competition coming from cable and the internet and enacted a deregulatory law known as Section 202(h) of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. It mandates that the FCC “shall” repeal or modify any broadcast-ownership rule it determines is no longer “necessary in the public interest as the result of competition.” The Third Circuit’s legal misinterpretation of this statute and the FCC’s obligation to act in the “public interest” are at the heart of the appeal.<br />Over the decades, the FCC, not Congress, created a broad definition of the “public interest” when it came to broadcast ownership rules. Among many factors, the agency has included five different types of “diversity” in its analysis: viewpoint, outlet, program, source and minority and female ownership. But in 1996 Congress singled out “competition,” not diversity, as the primary factor for the FCC to consider in its public-interest analysis.<br />Lawmakers intended Section 202(h) to give broadcasters the freedom to create defensive combinations and economies of scale, thereby liberating capital to invest in societally beneficial programming such as local news and severe-weather warnings. Today broadcasters face declining viewership and slumping ad dollars as viewers turn to alternatives on the internet. Local over-the-air TV ad revenue has plummeted more than 40% since 2000, adjusted for inflation, and the pandemic has made matters worse. Meanwhile, online ad purchases have skyrocketed. Google’s share of local ad revenue in 2019 alone, about $17 billion, was equal to all the local ad income of every TV station across the country combined.</td>

      <td>Daniel Ek wanted to bring Napster’s idea of a musical smorgasbord into the world of legal streaming. Would record labels play along?</td>
      <td>Neil Young, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham owe Daniel Ek an enormous debt of gratitude right about now. The rock legends have all recently sold their song publishing rights for gigantic sums, sell-offs that can partially be attributed to the surge in digital revenue that accounts for more than half the global recorded-music market. One man saw all this coming before anyone else: Mr. Ek, the 37-year-old co-founder of Spotify, the world’s largest streaming service with 320 million users and counting.<br />For those of us who regularly call up almost any song we desire with a tap on our phone screens, it’s easy to think of streaming music as an inevitable development. But for Mr. Ek, streaming’s triumph was more of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Having endured years of pushback, Spotify has been at the vanguard of a global revolution in the way music is consumed. It’s quite a turnabout for the Stockholm native, who has endured heaps of negative press, the enmity of underpaid musicians everywhere, and the looming threat of competing services from Apple, Jay-Z’s Tidal and many others.<br />Co-written by two veteran reporters who have closely tracked the Swedish technology sector, “The Spotify Play” (translated into English by the authors themselves) delivers an outsider-to-kingmaker narrative that should be read by every gun-shy entrepreneur too spooked by Silicon Valley’s giants to go head-to-head with them. Mr. Ek has outlasted his competitors and defied his critics: His triumphs are soundtracked by 1.5 billion user-generated Spotify playlists.<br />A rabid music fan as a teenager, Mr. Ek’s exposure to Napster was a profound conversion experience. Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker’s file-sharing service was the shrapnel blast that tore holes through the web’s commercial firewalls. “Napster is probably the internet service which has changed my life more than anything else,” Mr. Ek once told an interviewer. What if he could merge Napster’s peer-to-peer technology with commercial content? What if he could draw file-sharing out of the shadows?<br />Even while Mr. Ek was rapidly moving up as a programmer in Stockholm’s hot tech market, the notion of a legal answer to Napster’s music streaming never left him. In 2006 Mr. Ek’s tiny startup Advertigo was acquired by Tradedoubler, a digital marketing company whose co-founder Martin Lorentzon was enamored of Mr. Ek and his ideas. The savvy, flamboyant Mr. Lorentzon would become both partner and cheerleader. When he came to visit Mr. Ek in his raffish Stockholm neighborhood, Mr. Ek quoted “The Godfather” at him: “Put your hand in your pocket like you have a gun.”</td>

      <td>Quant hedge fund tells clients that drop of 20% to 30% was partly due to increased volatility</td>
      <td>Quant pioneer Renaissance Technologies LLC sent clients an analysis of its performance and a rationalization of recent deep losses, an unusual move for one of Wall Street’s most secretive firms.<br />In the letter sent late Friday, the firm said losses of between 20% and 30% in 2020 for its three funds open to outside investors should have been expected at some point during the course of the funds’ histories. The letter partly blamed heightened volatility for the weak performance.<br />Still, some clients said the letter was short on meaningful explanations.<br />The decision to reach out to investors with a letter follows an awful year for several of Renaissance’s hedge funds, with some clients having expressed unhappiness in recent days. The weak performance of some of the firm’s outside funds has spurred investor withdrawals. Renaissance manages nearly $60 billion firmwide, down from about $75 billion a year ago.<br />“Although recent performance has been terrible and worse than prior performance would have suggested was likely for 2020,” the letter says, “in track records as long as ours, some risk-return ratios every bit as bad as the ones we are now seeing are not shocking.”</td>

      <td>Biden’s pick to lead Treasury says Congress must ‘act big’ to boost economic recovery, fend off ‘long-term scarring’</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Janet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden’s choice for Treasury secretary, plans to tell lawmakers that the U.S. risks a longer, more painful recession unless Congress approves more aid and urge them to “act big” to shore up the recovery.<br />Ms. Yellen is set to testify Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee, which is considering her nomination, according to a copy of her prepared remarks that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />“Economists don’t always agree, but I think there is a consensus now: Without further action, we risk a longer, more painful recession now—and long-term scarring of the economy later,” Ms. Yellen will say. “Over the next few months, we are going to need more aid to distribute the vaccine; to reopen schools; to help states keep firefighters and teachers on the job.”<br />Mr. Biden’s nomination of Ms. Yellen positions the 74-year-old labor economist to lead his administration’s efforts to advance the recovery from the destruction caused by the coronavirus pandemic and related shutdowns. She will also play a key role in pushing the administration’s economic agenda on Capitol Hill, a job that will start in earnest Tuesday, said Tony Fratto, a senior Treasury and White House aide in the George W. Bush administration.<br />Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, unveiled last week, provides for another round of direct stimulus payments, extended and enhanced jobless benefits, funding for schools and first responders and the creation of a nationwide vaccination program. It also includes longstanding Democratic priorities, such as raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding paid leave for workers.</td>

      <td>LONDON—French energy giant  Total SE  said it would pay $2.5 billion for a 20% stake in the world’s largest solar developer, the latest move by an oil major to expand in renewable power.<br />Total said Monday the investment in  Adani Green Energy Ltd.  would help it meet its targets for generating more power from low-carbon sources amid a continuing global transition away from fossil fuels—a shift some analysts say is being accelerated by the pandemic.<br />The company, along with other oil majors including  BP  PLC and  Royal Dutch Shell  PLC, has pledged to increase spending on renewable energy such as wind and solar power in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. Total plans to spend $3 billion a year on renewables by 2030, around 20% of its annual investment budget and up from $2 billion last year.<br />The Adani deal gives Total exposure to a leading renewables business in India, one of the world’s fastest-growing markets for energy demand. Adani has 54 wind and solar projects in operation across the country, including one of the world’s largest solar projects in Kamuthi, Southern India. Based on existing generating capacity and the projects in its pipeline, Adani is the world’s largest developer of solar power, Total said.<br />As part of the deal, Total is also taking a 50% stake in a portfolio of Adani’s solar assets and getting a seat on the company’s board. The move will help Total toward its goal of having 35 gigawatts of renewable power capacity by 2025, up from around 7 gigawatts last year.</td>

      <td>Phil Gramm and Mike Solon argue that stimulus spending is all about political, not economic outcomes.</td>
      <td>Phil Gramm and Mike Solon argue that “The Era of Nonstop Stimulus” (op-ed, Jan. 4) that began in response to the pandemic threatens to become an Obamanomics stimulus sequel on steroids. The Obama economy struggled to exceed 2% a year growth for eight years, as federal debt piled up. The Biden administration now plans to spend trillions of dollars more than the $3.3 trillion of stimulus since the pandemic began.<br />The authors contend that stimulus spending is all about political not economic, outcomes. Mr. Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders’s “unity” document is a playbook for social justice and inclusive economics. Both are about righting America’s past wrongs and creating more dependents on the state. The metrics the authors use for economic success—e.g., 3% annual growth is better than 2%—aren’t the metrics used in inclusive economics. Which groups get the benefits of growth is more important to Democrats than the absolute level of growth. If income inequality is less with 2% growth because of stimulus spending, confiscatory taxes, income redistribution and suboptimal investments by Washington, that is an acceptable tradeoff. If an era of nonstop stimulus ends with economic malaise or collapse, the outcome may be palatable as long as inequality is less when everyone (other than the political class and its cronies) is worse off.<br />Democrats have the media covering their backs when it comes to assigning blame for an economic mess. The left’s control of messaging grew stronger as a result of the mob invasion of the Capitol, with tech giants using it as an excuse to purge social-media voices that disturb progressives.<br />Philip Grant<br />Palm Coast, Fla.</td>

His personal courage is as notable as Vladimir Putin’s fear of his appeal.<br />Mr. Navalny, Mr. Putin’s most effective domestic critic, fell into a coma in August after being poisoned with a chemical nerve-agent of the Novichok group. Last month Mr. Navalny and investigative outlet Bellingcat presented compelling evidence tying the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to the poisoning.<br />The dissident spent several months convalescing in Berlin, and he could have remained safe outside Russia.

China being China, there’s much more—and less—to the story.<br />The top-line data make China a rare good news story in the pandemic year. Inflation-adjusted GDP growth hit 6.5% in the last three months of the year, making it 2.3% for 2020. This contrasts with the rest of the world, where social distancing and lockdowns have triggered some of the worst contractions on record and raise the specter of long and difficult recoveries.<br />Some of Beijing’s cheerleaders want you to believe this is mainly because the Chinese government acted so aggressively to suppress the pandemic. That story sits uneasily alongside Beijing’s slow-rolling of early information about Covid-19 when more information sharing might have helped other countries.<br />Beijing adopted particularly aggressive lockdowns once it did act, sealing off entire cities and even now locking down apartment buildings or neighborhoods at a moment’s notice to suppress outbreaks. To the extent anyone can trust Beijing’s data about virus spread, it appears to have Covid mostly under control.<br />But a closer look at the economy suggests the growth has come from somewhere other than Beijing’s putative suppression of the pandemic. China’s Communist Party reverted to its old economic-crisis playbook to goose debt and exports while tightening political dominance over the economy.</td>

Both she and Mr. Biden have said she would be a full partner, sharing her opinions on every decision and taking on tasks he won’t have time to manage, as the sharply divided country copes with a pandemic and a still-recovering economy.<br />“There’s not a single decision I’ve made yet about personnel or about how to proceed that I haven’t discussed it with Kamala first,” Mr. Biden said last month.<br />While Mr. Biden, 78, is in good health, he will be the oldest president to be sworn into office, putting the role of Ms. Harris, 56, as next in the line of succession and as a party leader into greater focus. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader from New York, is 70, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, is 80.<br />Ms. Harris’s challenge—as is the case for every vice president—will be to help Mr. Biden’s agenda without contradicting or overshadowing him.</td>

His close association with Mr. Biden has drawn comparisons to James A. Baker III, the longtime friend and political adviser to President George H.W. Bush before becoming his secretary of state, though Mr. Baker came to the post with experience as Treasury Secretary and White House chief of staff during the Reagan administration.<br />For Mr. Blinken, however, a high-profile cabinet position will be a new role. He has spent much of his career in the shadow of his powerful mentor and will now be called on to demonstrate his skills as a foreign-policy strategist and the nation’s chief diplomat.<br />In his Tuesday hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Blinken plans to sketch out a vision in which the U.S. has a central role in wrestling with global problems, uses alliances and international institutions to try to expand its leverage and pursues policies that it can argue benefit the American middle class.<br />That approach is intended to supplant President Trump’s “America First” doctrine as an organizing principle for foreign policy while also seeking to draw popular support for the Biden agenda from voters who might otherwise be sympathetic to Mr. Trump’s approach.</td>

It was the first time he had tried to return to Russia since a near-fatal poison attack last August that left him in a coma and undergoing treatment in Germany.<br />He was remanded in custody until Feb. 15, and now faces a court decision that could turn a suspended sentence he received for an embezzlement case in 2014 into a real prison term. Authorities say he violated the terms of his parole while he was abroad recovering from August’s attack.<br />The European Court of Human Rights said in 2018 that the original case was politically motivated and those charges are trumped up. In addition, Russian prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into him for allegedly siphoning donations to his Anti-Corruption Foundation.<br />Mr. Navalny says both legal moves were politically motivated and meant to scare him away from returning to Russia. In short videos from the courtroom distributed among supporters, Mr. Navalny, 44 years old, said his detention showed that Mr. Putin fears his opposition movement, which will seek to make gains in a parliamentary election in September. He also called on supporters to hold public protests in a show of force.</td>

      <td>Early in the Democratic presidential primary campaign, much of the debate revolved around tax, regulatory and legislative proposals deeply significant to business.<br />But as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office, the focus is instead on the more pressing tasks of fighting the Covid-19 pandemic and stabilizing the economy.<br />“There is a crisis going on, and that crisis has to be addressed—everything else is on hold,” says Benjamin Salisbury, director of research and senior policy analyst with Height Capital Markets.<br />Even so, investors and policy makers alike are looking beyond the current crisis, trying to gauge what changes the Biden administration will seek in infrastructure, climate, tax, trade, health-care, antitrust and technology policy.<br />Chances are good, analysts say, that the new administration will shy away from the pattern seen in President Obama’s first term, which largely sought sweeping legislation in tightly focused policy areas: financial regulation, health care and climate change.</td>

      <td>Model Y is the second vehicle Tesla is making in China, the world’s biggest EV market</td>
      <td>SHANGHAI— Tesla Inc.  delivered its first made-in-China Model Y compact crossover vehicles on Monday, the latest milestone in the American company’s drive into the world’s largest market for electric cars.<br />A local Model Y buyer said he attended a Monday event at a Tesla store in Shanghai to mark the start of deliveries and received his vehicle. Tesla on Monday said via  Twitter  that “Model Y deliveries in China have officially begun.”<br />Tesla, which broke ground at its Shanghai plant two years ago, rushed to start producing cars there and expand capacity. Manufacturing cars locally helps the Palo Alto, Calif.-based electric vehicle maker save on shipping costs and avoid import duties for the Chinese market.<br />The Model Y is the second Tesla vehicle that the EV maker is producing at Shanghai after the Model 3 sedan, which the company started delivering a year ago in China—which was marked with a visit to the plant by Chief Executive Elon Musk. As it ramped up production of the sedan last year, it was also building the assembly line in Shanghai for the Model Y.<br />The Model 3 was the bestselling electric vehicle in China last year, with more than 138,000 sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association—an eighth of the 1.11 million EVs sold nationwide.</td>

      <td>A venture to launch small satellites using a rocket fired from a converted jumbo jet deployed 10 tiny ones into orbit for the first time Sunday, providing a big boost for the startup founded by entrepreneur Richard Branson.<br />The successful demonstration flight by Southern-California-based Virgin Orbit, nearly eight months after a botched test, lifts the company into the select group of small-satellite launch providers able to offer flight-proven hardware.<br />With the proliferation of small-satellite manufacturers across the U.S. and other regions, specialized launch providers are rushing to fill the demand to blast their products into space. They include Rocket Lab, a U.S.-New Zealand company that has a flight-proven rocket; Texas-based Firefly Aerospace; and Relativity Space, which plans to launch 3-D manufactured rockets. But only a few of the startups can claim the distinction of blasting out of the atmosphere, a goal Mr. Branson and his team have pursued for years, even as more-conventional rocket designs grabbed most of the public attention.<br />Virgin Orbit’s novel airborne platform, a specially outfitted  Boeing Co.  747 jet named Cosmic Girl, climbed to an altitude of roughly 6 miles above the Pacific Ocean and released a slender, 70-foot rocket slung under its left wing. The booster’s main liquid-fueled engine roared to life, transporting the cluster of cubesats, or miniature satellites, built by universities and sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, into low-Earth orbit.<br />Mr. Branson said the company’s LauncherOne rocket would encourage “a whole new generation of innovators on the path to orbit.” Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart said the company managed to demonstrate every element of its launch system. The next mission is slated to begin commercial operations, with customers including the U.K.’s Air Force and low-cost communications provider Swarm Technologies Inc.</td>

      <td><br />In a world of masks, it’s harder than ever to read the faces around us. Only now are scientists learning how we manage without the revealing tells of smiles, sneers, dimples and frowns that signal our state of mind, as masks in public settings become common in more than 50 countries.<br />While a public health necessity, masks challenge our skill in understanding facial expressions, confusing our ability to distinguish disgust from anger or happiness from indifference, several new studies say. Scientists worry about the implications for infants and children who may lag in learning to recognize subtle facial signals of anger, fear, doubt, delight and sorrow. While data is sparse, one new study suggests that children have as much trouble reading facial expressions when people are wearing masks as when they are wearing sunglasses.<br />In that test, the children correctly identified the emotional expression on uncovered faces about 66% of the time, well above the odds of just guessing, psychologist Ashley Ruba at the University of Wisconsin-Madison said. Looking at faces in surgical-type masks, however, the children were only able to correctly identify sadness about 28% of the time, anger 27% of the time, and fear 18% of the time.<br />“For very young children, I think it is still an open question as to how they’ll navigate these situations,” said Dr. Ruba, who studies how children learn to understand other people’s emotions. “Infants can use all these other cues, like tone of voice.”</td>

Official Saudi announcements show no drug-related executions since January 2020, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch.<br />The move comes as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appeals to Western tourists and foreign investors put off by Saudi Arabia’s reputation as a bastion of ultraconservative social norms enforced by religious police. Beheadings and crucifixions were once commonplace in public squares, including in the center of Riyadh, the capital.</td>

What happens next is anyone’s guess.<br />Normally, the U.S. and every other figure skating power would send its winners on to the world championships, and that would determine how many skaters each country can send to the Winter Olympics next year.<br />For Nathan Chen, who is now a five-time U.S. men’s champion, the world event would also be a chance to cement his case for the Olympic title that eluded him in 2018. For the ice dance champions, Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue, it would help stake their claim for a 2022 Olympic medal, after several years of trading places with other couples for the top position in the U.S.<br />For the U.S. ladies, including champion Bradie Tennell, strong showings would allow them to field three Olympic entries and increase the chances that at least one female skater might be able to break through and return an American to the podium for the first time since 2006. And for the beleaguered U.S. pairs, securing even two Olympic entries would allow them to halt the American slide in that discipline.<br />But the coronavirus pandemic has the 2021 world championships in Stockholm teetering, after the virus already forced the cancellation of the 2020 world championships set for Montreal last March. The victorious U.S. skaters are keenly aware that the tickets they’ve just punched may be tickets to nowhere.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—When President-elect Joe Biden’s advisers wrote his climate plan, they often had one small audience in mind: the U.S. Senate.<br />That chamber has been reluctant to forcefully address climate issues with major new laws, but expectations are growing after election victories in Georgia Jan. 5 gave Democrats Senate control. The shift has made infrastructure funding for cleaner energy a realistic possibility and offers a likely kick-start for Mr. Biden’s ambitious agenda.<br />The Democratic control is still narrow—both parties have 50 Senate seats and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaks ties—and that is likely to limit how far Mr. Biden and fellow Democrats can reach. But the Biden team has tailored some of its plans for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to benefit auto makers, oil and gas producers, and utilities, an appeal to moderate Democrats and some Republicans in the Senate needed to pass legislation.<br />Mr. Biden, as a candidate, had called for $2 trillion in spending on projects to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions that most scientists implicate in climate change.<br />Democrats have rallied behind consensus studies that call for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions in half by 2030 and effectively ending them by roughly 2050 to avoid catastrophic consequences.  But many still consider it politically unpalatable to respond with new taxes or regulatory powers that might hurt industry. That leaves government investment through direct spending, loans and tax breaks as the most widely popular ideas.</td>

      <td>Why the house I run will bring out Josh Hawley’s new book.</td>
      <td>I am an independent book publisher, and in recent days I have been taking calls from journalists asking which authors I would refuse to publish. That’s an odd question to ask an American publisher, but suddenly it seems to be on everyone’s mind in our industry. Some 250 self-described “publishing professionals”—mostly junior employees of major houses—have issued a statement titled “No Book Deals for Traitors,” a category in which they include any “participant” in the Trump administration.<br />Readiness to silence someone because of who he is or whom he associates with is often called the “cancel culture,” but I prefer an older term—blacklisting—whose historical associations expose the ugliness of what is going on. Not so long ago, publishing professionals would have been horrified to be accused of it. Today they compete to see who can proclaim his blacklist with the fiercest invective.<br />On Jan. 6, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri invoked his legal right to object to Congress’s certification of electoral votes. Reasonable people can disagree whether his act was noble or cynical, courageous or rash, but no one can reasonably argue that he intended to incite that afternoon’s invasion of the Capitol by a lawless mob. He immediately and forcefully condemned the attack. But the next day Simon & Schuster canceled his forthcoming book, “The Tyranny of Big Tech,” citing the senator’s “role in what became a dangerous threat.”<br />I started getting calls from reporters in effect daring me not to join the blacklisters and from publishers, editors and agents who wondered when and how the mob would come for them.<br />The founder of my publishing house, Henry Regnery, proudly called himself a “dissident publisher.” The conservative books to which he devoted his fortune and career were no more in favor in 1951, when he published William F. Buckley’s “God and Man at Yale,” than they have been during my own 25 years in this business. But blacklisting then, though real, was discreet. Everyone knew it was un-American. No one was proud of it.</td>

The former head of the Federal Reserve plans to affirm a commitment to market-driven exchange rates when she testifies in Senate hearings on Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported.<br />“This just rubs in this doubt among investors” who have bet heavily against the dollar, said Jane Foley, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank.<br />In futures markets, investors have piled into bets on a weakening dollar. Net bets against the dollar are almost as high as they were in late September, according to an analysis of Commodity Futures Trading Commission data by the  Royal Bank of Canada ,  which was the most negative the market had been since April 2018.</td>

      <td>The ruling coalition collapses in a fight over spending EU money.</td>
      <td>A new year brings a new political crisis for Italy, as former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi withdrew last week from the motley coalition government in Rome. Setting aside the operatic personal feuds in play, this episode highlights a serious challenge for Europe as Covid-19 spending relief efforts get underway in earnest.<br />Mr. Renzi withdrew his support from Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s coalition, leaving the government several seats short of a majority in the parliament’s upper chamber. Much of the motivation appears to be personal pique of little interest to anyone other than Italian politicos.<br />But there is a kernel of a serious policy question. Italy stands to be the largest recipient from the €750 billion Covid-19 recovery fund the European Union has created, and Messrs. Conte and Renzi have spent weeks feuding over how Rome’s expected €209 billion share of that grants-and-loans pot should be spent. Mr. Conte would prefer to put himself and a clutch of appointed technocrats in charge of disbursing the funds. Mr. Renzi demanded more parliamentary oversight.<br />The mystery is why so many fervent supporters of a greater fiscal role for the EU appear to be taking Mr. Conte’s side in this fight. They complain Mr. Renzi would empower Italy’s notoriously dysfunctional parliament to divvy up European grants for political purposes, and suggest he should get out of the way so Rome can get on with the spending.<br />But Mr. Conte’s early drafts of his spending plans would empower Italy’s equally dysfunctional bureaucracy to throw around the cash for different political reasons. Better to take the waste, fraud and abuse that comes with at least some democratic oversight.</td>

      <td>Years later, Democratic prosecutors charge former Gov. Rick Snyder.</td>
      <td>Nine people, including former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, were criminally charged last week in connection with the yearslong crisis in Flint’s drinking water. The public indictments are terse, with little evidence. So it’s difficult not to wonder if the case against Mr. Snyder, especially, is politicizing the tragedy.<br />The charges range in severity. The former director of the Michigan health department faces nine counts of involuntary manslaughter, each punishable by 15 years. Two of Flint’s former emergency managers are charged with misconduct, a combined seven counts that each carry five years. The ex-head of the city’s public works department could get two years for willful neglect of duty.<br />That’s also the charge against Mr. Snyder. One count says he willfully neglected his duty under the Michigan constitution “by failing to inquire into the performance, condition and administration of the public offices and officers that he appointed and was required to supervise.” A second count says Mr. Snyder neglected his legal duty “by failing to declare a state of emergency and/or disaster” in Flint after he was notified of the water crisis.<br />“The secrecy provisions over the grand jury proceedings do not allow for discussion of the grand jury evidence,” the state Attorney General’s office said. A prosecutor argued Thursday that this “goes far beyond leading a large organization and someone in your organization makes a mistake.” But Mr. Snyder’s indictment, by a single judge acting as grand juror, raises the eyebrow. It cites the state’s emergency law, which says that the Governor “shall” declare a disaster “if he or she finds” that one exists or is threatened, which sounds like a judgment call.<br />Mr. Snyder’s successor, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, wildly abused her authority under the same law, as the Michigan Supreme Court said last year. Disaster declarations are limited to 28 days unless the Legislature extends them. As a work-around, Ms. Whitmer opted to declare repeated new emergencies for identical reasons.</td>

      <td>Car giant formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and French peer PSA can make valuable cost savings but also has some expensive problems</td>
      <td>The merger of Fiat Chrysler and its French peer PSA will create a trans-Atlantic giant out of two smaller car makers. One of its biggest challenges is to go truly global.<br />Shares in Stellantis—the new company’s name, apparently derived from the Latin for “to brighten with stars”—rose roughly 6% on the morning of their first trading day in Paris and Milan on Monday. The deal was wound up rapidly after receiving antitrust clearance from the European Union before Christmas. The company agreed to some remedies in the region’s van market. The shares start trading in New York on Tuesday.<br />Based on analysts’ revenue forecasts for 2020, Stellantis will be the world’s fourth-largest auto maker by revenues, behind  Volkswagen ,   Toyota  and Daimler. By expected operating profits, which matter more as the industry grapples with an expensive transition to electric vehicles, it will be the third largest, behind  Toyota  and  General Motors .<br />The deal’s biggest advantage is its consolidation of the fragmented and fiercely competitive European market. Through November, Fiat Chrysler had a 6.6% share of passenger-vehicle sales in the region last year, while PSA’s brands—Peugeot, Citroën, Opel and Vauxhall—had 15.4%. Merging the two will release €5 billion in cost savings, equivalent to $6 billion, says Stellantis, which is more than 40% of the companies’ combined 2019 operating profit. Chief executive Carlos Tavares has a proven template to follow, having absorbed the European business of General Motors for PSA.<br />Yet the merger also brings another benefit, less concrete but longer-lasting: It creates a company with roughly equal heft on either side of the Atlantic. Despite the Italian-American roots of Fiat Chrysler, the company has made the vast majority of profits in the U.S. in recent years, thanks to strong sales of RAM pickup trucks and Jeep sport-utility vehicles. PSA was an overwhelmingly European business.</td>

      <td>A Hall of Fame quarterback has a new team in yet another conference title game. Green Bay looms</td>
      <td>Tom Brady needs to settle down. He’s making the rest of us look bad. Another Super Bowl is on the verge, and once more, here is Brady, age 78, or rather 43, solid arm, fab mane, on a new team, in a new state, amid a new conference, and, after Tampa Bay’s 30-20 victory over New Orleans on Sunday, just one win away from reaching the NFL’s grandest stage, for the 10th time in his historic career.<br />It’s too much. He’s showing off. At his age, Tom Brady should be at home, rump on the couch, hand sunk into nachos, struggling to stay awake for the second half of an NFL playoff game—not playing in one. Instead, Brady is football’s Benjamin Button, aging in reverse, denying himself onion rings and chocolate cake and extending a playing career well past the standard expiration. Brady is in his 21st season, and next Sunday’s NFC Championship versus the Green Bay Packers will be the 14th conference title game he’s played in, a ridiculous rate of success. He and the Bucs will face the talented Packers sprite Aaron Rodgers, who is 37 years old, or, as Brady calls it, midcareer.<br />How long does Brady go? Unclear. He is under contract for another season in Tampa Bay, and he does not appear to be tumbling to the mean. After upping sticks in New England after two dynastic decades, abandoning the joy of sleet and Bill Belichick for sun and groovy Bruce Arians, Brady turned in a stirring snowbird season: 4,633 yards passing, and 40 touchdowns, the latter a franchise record. Change is supposed to be a chore at an advanced age, but Brady has revived Tampa Bay, delivering the team its first two playoff victories since its Super Bowl in 2003. Should the Bucs somehow scoot past the Pack—a big if, as the game is at Lambeau, and Green Bay might be the best of the four remaining playoff teams—Tampa would be the first club to ever host a Super Bowl in its home stadium. As Florida codas go, Brady’s had one of the sprightliest.<br />He just keeps on keeping on. Sunday’s divisional round contest—the Blanda Bowl, Brady versus the 42-year-old Drew Brees, a combined octogenarian between them—wasn’t exactly a showcase of age defiance. Brady looked rough at first. Brees, reported by Fox Sports’s Jay Glazer to be on the edge of retirement, looked rougher, throwing three interceptions on the evening. Honestly, the most impressive QB moment came from a millennial: New Orleans backup Jameis Winston, age 27, who stepped in for a trick-play cameo and a 56-yard touchdown strike for the Saints.<br />There are indeed moments when Brady looks 43, or at least not a day under 39. Entering Sunday’s 6:40 p.m. ET start, there was a comical narrative that Brady’s performance in night games had been lately subpar because, on an ordinary evening, he usually puts himself to bed early, somewhere around 9 p.m. It sounded like a dig at Brady’s fussy, restrictive lifestyle. People were worrying about Tom Brady like parents lamenting a fitful toddler. If he’s not finished with the football game and in his pajamas at 8:30, he’s going to be a tantrum nightmare tomorrow. No, he cannot have another “Frog and Toad” story! Lights out!</td>

      <td>The 27-year-old star breaks record for most streams by a country album in a week</td>
      <td>Morgan Wallen broke the record for the most streams by a country album in a week, as country music gets more traction online and becomes a bigger part of overall listening on streaming services.<br />“Dangerous: The Double Album,” by the mullet-wearing country star from East Tennessee, tops the latest Billboard 200 album chart, powered by its 240 million U.S. streams in the week ended Jan. 14. That more than doubles the prior record, 102 million streams, achieved by Luke Combs last October. In its debut week, “Dangerous” also sold 74,000 U.S. copies as a full package, bringing its total to the equivalent of 265,000 in sales, according to MRC Data, formerly Nielsen Music.<br />“Dangerous,” which was released on Jan. 8 on Big Loud Records and Republic Records, is considered a bid for superstardom by Mr. Wallen, whose rapid rise has captured the attention of music-industry watchers. Billboard magazine, the music trade publication, put Mr. Wallen on its cover this month. The New Yorker magazine called him “the most wanted man in country.” Mr. Wallen also made headlines when “Saturday Night Live” dis-invited him as musical guest, after he broke Covid-19 protocols, before inviting him again in December.<br />“The guy seems capable of becoming Garth Brooks for a new generation,” Chris DeVille, senior news editor at music website Stereogum, wrote this month.<br />Mr. Wallen’s popularity is a big moment for country music, which historically has lagged behind hip-hop, rock and pop on streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. Increasingly, more country stars are succeeding thanks in part to streaming, with Sam Hunt, Luke Combs and Gabby Barrett joining streaming success stories like Florida Georgia Line.</td>

And he feels for you.<br />“You don’t have anything on your side right now,” says the University of Calgary business professor and author of “The Procrastination Equation.” “You’re on the windswept plains with no way of hiding from that cold breeze. You are completely exposed.”<br />The pandemic has brought us to peak procrastination. Turns out your office—in addition to being in plain sight of your boss—came with environmental cues that reminded you that you had to, you know, work. Without the hum of the industrial printer and the sight of colleagues marching off to the conference room, we all tend toward aimlessness.<br />“If you don’t have routine, you’re just making it a question mark again. Will I, won’t I?” Dr. Steel says. “Asking yourself what you want to do—you probably want to actually check what’s on Instagram.”</td>

      <td>Spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic, outdoor pursuits, digital convenience and safety obsession are seen having a lasting impact</td>
      <td>Many of the new habits consumers formed during the coronavirus pandemic are here to stay, market researcher Euromonitor International predicts.<br />In 2021 consumers will be demanding, anxious, and creative in dealing with change, Euromonitor forecasts in its annual trend report. People will expect increased activism from brands they use, new options for digital services in their daily lives, and more help in achieving mental and physical wellness.<br />Though some of this year’s trends are directly related to Covid-19—like heightened safety concerns and demand for more open-air spaces—these shifts will continue after the pandemic wanes, says Alison Angus, Euromonitor’s head of lifestyle research. “These changes happened so quickly and have quickly manifested for the long term,” she says.<br />Euromonitor, a global market-research firm based in London, has released its forecasts since 2010. Last year, just three months after publishing its January 2020 predictions, it revised its expectations to reflect dramatic shifts in consumer behavior spurred by the pandemic, flagging new trends like the home’s transformation into a multifunctional refuge used for work, school, leisure and exercise. It also noted the pause of other trends like previously rising privacy concerns.<br />Its forecasts haven’t always come true, at least so far: Euromonitor’s 2018 prediction that DNA-informed personalized nutrition and skin-care products would quickly accelerate didn't come to pass because such regimens remain too onerous, Ms. Angus says. Last year’s expected boom in demand for reusable products also didn’t materialize amid consumers’ sanitary concerns during the pandemic. “Sustainability really took a hit last year,” Ms. Angus says. “But I think consumers are reverting back to it.”</td>

      <td>Startup Sana Biotechnology could go public at a $10 billion valuation. Recent history suggests the high price tag may be worth it.</td>
      <td>A biotechnology startup is poised to go public with a roughly $10 billion price tag a year before it begins human clinical trials for its drug candidates. That isn’t as crazy as it sounds.<br />Sana Biotechnology, which is developing cell-engineering platforms that it says could change the way many diseases are treated, plans to sell $150 million of stock in a coming initial public offering, the company said in a securities filing last week. While it is unknown how many shares it plans to sell, investors are expecting a valuation of between $9 billion and $12 billion.<br />The Sana IPO is arriving as biotech stocks are near records. A broad index of small and midsize biotech firms has rallied about 60% in the past year. And Sana won’t be delivering on its promises anytime soon: Clinical trials in humans for its drug candidates won’t begin until 2022.<br />That backdrop will understandably scare some investors. Ambitions to tackle cancer, diabetes and central-nervous-system disorders under one roof aren’t cheap. While Sana has $459 million in cash and equivalents on its books, it spent $153 million on research and development in the first nine months of 2020, up from $80 million over the same period in 2019. Expenses tend to grow as drug programs advance to later stages. Furthermore, stocks with a long-dated potential payoff, like speculative biotechs, are likely to underperform should the Federal Reserve choose to tighten monetary policy. And of course, drug development is notoriously uncertain, and there is a chance that a Sana drug candidate never reaches the market.<br />That logic, however, would have caused investors to eschew Moderna when it went public in late 2018 at a $7 billion valuation, which at the time was a record for a biotech IPO. Those who bought and held have enjoyed a sevenfold return on their investment in just over two years. That trade wasn’t merely a lucky speculation, either: The company expects at least $11.7 billion in revenue this year from government-purchase agreements for its Covid-19 vaccine, and its success in developing an effective vaccine so quickly bodes well for its other programs in development.</td>

      <td>Turning around the chip maker will require not only sorting out manufacturing problems but also selling stakeholders on tough decisions about the company’s future</td>
      <td>How hard will the new  Intel  chief executive’s job be? The company’s top rival just gave some important clues.<br />Pat Gelsinger doesn’t start at the company until mid-February, but Intel’s fourth-quarter results Thursday afternoon will likely give a strong sign of at least his initial path. Intel has promised to use the occasion to update investors about its continuing manufacturing problems. The company has also said it would indicate whether it intends to stick with its long-running practice of being the sole manufacturer of the chips it designs, or whether it will begin outsourcing the production of some future designs, very likely to  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ,  or TSMC.<br />Mr. Gelsinger’s long tenure as an Intel engineer strongly suggests the chip maker isn’t ready to throw in the towel just yet on manufacturing. But competing with an ascendant TSMC will be a daunting task. TSMC reported Thursday that revenue for 2020 surged 31%—its best growth in more than a decade—to a record $45.5 billion. And demand is so hot for the company’s manufacturing services that TSMC also plans to pour a record amount into capital expenditures for the coming year to expand its capacity. The chip maker expects to spend between $25 billion and $28 billion for 2021—double the annual capex bill that Intel has averaged over the past five years.<br />Intel is still a much bigger company, with 2020 revenue projected to land around $75.3 billion—up 5% from the previous year. But the recent lift from booming PC sales and data-center demand won’t solve the company’s manufacturing woes. Wall Street currently expects Intel’s revenue this year to fall 7%—which would be the company’s worst decline in more than a decade. TSMC is projected to boost revenue 20% to about $54.4 billion for 2021, according to FactSet.<br />Intel says it has made strong progress on its 7-nanometer manufacturing process, which has been the source of recent trouble. But TSMC is now making more advanced chips en masse at 5 nanometers. The company is already developing its 3-nanometer process, which it said Thursday would be producing chips in volume by the second half of 2022. That means that even if Mr. Gelsinger is successful at getting Intel’s manufacturing process back on track, the company will still be badly lagging. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein says Intel’s disadvantage to TSMC is “likely set in stone” for at least the next three years.</td>

But the conversation in the wake of the storming of the Capitol was particularly daunting because of its historic nature and the political sensitivities embedded in it, he said.<br />Some students said President Trump incited the riot; others said he just gave a speech. In a vigorous, civil debate, the teens looked up the definition to incite and discussed the constitutional right to protest and the 25th amendment.<br />At the end, Mr. Ridenour tied what happened at the Capitol back to their lesson on civic virtues like honor, respect and responsibility. “Regardless of where you stand on this, if you look at these virtues did you feel like it was on display with what occurred?” he asked. The students held firm to their different opinions, he said.<br />The Capitol riot and this week’s presidential inauguration have become teachable moments in classes around the nation, pulling civics education to the forefront as teachers say they face new questions from students and others say it all exemplifies the need for a better civics curriculum and funding.</td>

I’m capable of forming my own ideas,” the 33-year-old nurse says. “There is some mistrust of the authorities on my part, when you see how the crisis has been managed in France from the start.”<br />France’s mass vaccination campaign is off to a glacial start, with only around 422,000 people receiving the vaccine in more than three weeks since European regulators authorized the drug, far behind most other developed nations. A big reason: French officials are running up against deeply ingrained opposition that has made France among the world’s top vaccine skeptics.<br />An Ipsos poll conducted in December found that France ranked at the bottom of 15 countries on willingness to take a Covid-19 vaccine, with only 40% of the public saying they wanted the shot. Polls show that more than three-quarters of nursing home workers—who are among the government’s first target groups for the vaccine—don’t want to take it.<br />The resistance has historical roots in the 19th century, when antivaccination groups campaigned against modern inoculation techniques discovered by Frenchman Louis Pasteur. In recent years, it has been fueled by widespread distrust of the government of President Emmanuel Macron, who has faced years of protests from the antiestablishment yellow-vests movement.</td>

There has been no evidence of widespread electoral fraud.<br />“What has happened shows that nothing is forever, that history has not ended, and that even the foundations of the world are changing,” Mr. Siemoniak said.<br />With President-elect Joe Biden set to be sworn in on Wednesday behind a screen of heavy security, democratic leaders and those fighting for democracy around the world say the upheaval in the U.S. has left them shaken.

While that is the weakest annual rate of growth since the Mao era, it was enough to make China the only major world economy to gain any ground at all last year, and accelerated its likely overtaking of the U.S. economy, economists say.<br />The World Bank projects the global economy to have pulled back by 4.3% last year, dragged down by a 7.4% contraction in the eurozone. The U.S., the world’s largest economy, is expected to have shrunk by 3.6%.<br />In per-capita terms, China’s GDP, which surpassed $10,000 for the first time this year, remains far behind the U.S.’s $65,000. But the sheer size of its market, combined with its weathering of the worst economic downturn in memory, means that China is arguably entering the new year with a stronger hand—an advantage that leader Xi Jinping is expected to make use of after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn into office on Wednesday.</td>

In Britain’s case, uncertainty over the outcome of the country’s complicated divorce from the European Union extended that weakness into early fall.<br />But the fourth quarter marked a rebound in mergers and acquisitions in the U.K. as a vaccination program raised the prospect of bringing the virus under control. And Britain’s trade deal, which took effect at the start of January, assured companies and their advisers that the country’s exporters won’t face tariffs and quotas selling into the EU market.<br />The deal revival is illustrated by  MGM Resorts International ’s  unsolicited £8.09 billion, equivalent to $11 billion, bid this month for the U .K.’s  Entain  PLC, along with takeover battles for U.K. companies  Signature Aviation  PLC,  G4S  PLC and  Codemasters Group Holdings  PLC. At the same time, it reaffirms Britain’s reputation as one of the markets most open to takeover activity.<br />Though historically common, these types of contests were largely absent last year until 2020’s final quarter.

      <td>China handled the pandemic well, but it was also lucky. A strong 2021 seems assured, but 2022 and beyond could be challenging.</td>
      <td>By the terrible standards of 2020, China’s 2.3% growth stands out. That sets the country up well for a strong 2021, before some familiar challenges reassert themselves.<br />Official full-year figures released Monday confirmed that China’s economy is firmly on the mend, having performed impressively in the worst year for the global economy in recent memory.<br />This is partly because China handled the pandemic well, after initial missteps. But it was also lucky, both with its business cycle and because its key export industry, electronics, happened to uniquely benefit from pandemic-related demand in rich countries.<br />Although it wasn’t broadly appreciated at the time, China’s economy was already perking up in late 2019 due to the reviving fortunes of two of its largest, most labor-intensive manufacturing sectors: electronics and automobiles. Electronics in particular were boosted first by rebounding global smartphone shipments and then supercharged by demand for stay-at-home goods.<br />Profits in electronics and autos logged their strongest performances last year since 2017, growing 15.7% and 7.2%, respectively, in the first 11 months of the year compared with the same period in 2019. In contrast, overall industrial profits were up 2.4%.</td>

      <td>Russia is selling millions of doses of its homegrown Sputnik V vaccine abroad, making it a major supplier of a shot that could give Moscow a valuable slice of the global Covid-19 vaccine market and potentially earn Russia geopolitical clout in the developing world.<br />Argentina is the first major country outside Russia to begin inoculating with Sputnik on a large scale. However, the rollout there has highlighted questions concerning the lack of transparency about the efficacy of the state-sponsored Sputnik V, which has stirred some distrust among Argentines about its safety.<br />Moscow approved Sputnik V for domestic use in August before finishing trials. Trial data released since then has shown Sputnik was 91.4% effective in protecting people from Covid-19, and a peer-reviewed study is expected to be published in the coming weeks. Around a million Russians have received the shot.<br />Other countries have rushed to buy a vaccine that is cheaper than Western alternatives. Sputnik V, named for the Soviet satellite launched into orbit during the Cold War, ranks third in the world by doses ordered by middle- and low-income countries, according to Duke University’s Global Health Innovation Center, ahead of U.S. drugmakers  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna  and China’s vaccines. Eight countries outside Russia have authorized the shot for emergency use.<br />Still, Sputnik V hasn’t been approved by Western health authorities or received authorization from the WHO, which many developing countries rely on for vetting vaccines. Russia has initiated talks with the European Medicines Agency about approving the shot in the European Union and has applied for WHO authorization.</td>

      <td>SEOUL— Samsung ’s  de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong, returned to prison after an appeals court handed down a 30-month sentence following a retrial of his 2017 conviction on charges of bribing South Korea’s former president.<br />Mr. Lee, the 52-year-old grandson of  Samsung ’s  founder, walked free in 2018 when an appeals court lightened his original five-year sentence after he had spent nearly a year behind bars. South Korea’s Supreme Court ordered a retrial in 2019, leading to Monday’s verdict.<br />South Korean law gives judges discretion to suspend sentences of up to three years. But while delivering Monday’s verdict, the Seoul High Court judges said they believed Mr. Lee’s charges required him to serve more time in prison.<br />Wearing a dark tie and a face mask to court, Mr. Lee was taken into custody after the verdict. Mr. Lee is allowed to appeal his case to the nation’s Supreme Court, though overturning his new sentence is unlikely, South Korean legal experts say. A  Samsung Electronics Co.  spokesman declined to comment.<br />Mr. Lee’s absence leaves Samsung rudderless for the second time in four years as the technology giant struggles to chart a path out of the global Covid-19 pandemic. Going by “Jay Y. Lee” in the West, he had led the Samsung conglomerate since his father was incapacitated by a stroke in 2014. He was expected to formally take the Samsung chairmanship following the October death of his father, Lee Kun-hee.</td>

The World Bank expects the U.S. economy to contract by 3.6% this year and the eurozone’s to shrink by 7.4% in 2020, contributing to a global economic pullback of 4.3%.<br />China’s economy, the world’s second largest, finished the year on a high note. Gross domestic product rose 6.5% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, marking China’s best quarter of year-over-year growth in two years.<br />The results topped expectations. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected growth of 6% in the fourth quarter and an expansion of 2.2% for the full year.</td>

      <td>A cold snap and a supply crunch have created a perfect storm, but the pendulum is likely to swing the other way soon</td>
      <td>It’s been a wild year for commodity markets, marked by despair last spring as the world ground to a halt and followed more recently by exuberance. Nowhere has the bullish feeling been more evident than the usually staid market for liquefied natural gas: February futures for Asian gas hit nearly $20 per million British thermal units last week according to data from Refinitiv. As recently as mid-December, they were only trading around $8 per MMBtu.<br />Unfortunately for gas producers, today’s prices aren’t sustainable and the longer-term supply picture is bearish. Supply stoppages combined with the coldest winter in Asia in decades are a perfect market for those gas producers who still have capacity to supply spot shipments—including U.S. firms like Cheniere. But futures are already pricing in warmer weather a few months out: the April contract is currently trading around $7 per MMBtu.<br />Further out, Chinese demand is still the swing factor—as it is for most industrial commodities. Here the news is bullish, but perhaps less so than some LNG vendors might hope. Chinese demand continues to expand robustly, and China continues to consume far more gas than it produces. The bad news is that the growth of that supply gap has slowed noticeably in recent years.<br />New policies introduced in 2018 and 2019—including a 30% resource tax cut for shale gas and a subsidy pegged to how fast drillers increase output of shale gas and other forms of so-called unconventional gas—have sparked a sharp rise in investment. Chinese oil and gas exploration and development spending rose 25.5% in 2019, according to S&P Global. Natural gas production in 2019 rose faster than consumption for the first time since 2015, improving by 10%.<br />More recently, production growth in the first 11 months of 2020 was also about 9% compared with a year earlier. Annual output growth only averaged 6.7% from 2011 to 2018. And new pipeline capacity for gas from Russia is also poised to come online, which could boost pipeline gas imports that have mostly been flattish in recent years.</td>

The decision to tap Mr. Chopra, a Democrat currently serving as a member of the Federal Trade Commission, was expected to be announced along with that of Gary Gensler, Mr. Biden’s expected choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, the people said.<br />A spokesman for Mr. Biden’s transition team declined to comment.<br />Mr. Chopra previously served as the bureau’s student-loan ombudsman during the Obama administration, where he used his public stage to push student-loan companies to improve their treatment of borrowers. His tactic of applying pressure through public means was a big departure from the more measured style of other financial regulators.<br />The CFPB has been politically polarizing since its creation in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when President Obama tapped Elizabeth Warren, then a Harvard law professor, to set it up. Mr. Chopra, 38 years old, was an early hire of Ms. Warren, who is now a Democratic senator from Massachusetts.</td>

Several of the groups used violent rhetoric urging members to attend the D.C. rally the day of the Capitol riot.<br />Since then. some of the groups’ leaders have advised followers to stay away from Washington and other major cities that are preparing for this week with large law-enforcement presence.<br />An Indiana man, Jon Schaffer, identified as a member of the heavy metal band Iced Earth, was arrested on charges of engaging in violence in a restricted building, disorderly conduct and other crimes, and was photographed wearing a baseball cap at the riot bearing the words “Oath Keepers Lifetime Member,” according to an affidavit for his arrest filed on Saturday. The Anti-Defamation League calls the group an “antigovernment right-wing fringe organization.” The affidavit alleged that at the riot Mr. Schaffer used bear spray on police officers.<br />Mr. Schaffer couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.

      <td>An expiring arms-control deal is a chance to address hypersonics and make China come to the table.</td>
      <td>President-elect Joe Biden’s advisers have been signaling that they will rely on arms-control agreements with Russia to reduce the Defense Department budget. This is no surprise from a new, liberal administration promising dramatically increased domestic spending. Yet a second Trump term might have been little better. Eager to indulge in Covid-19 stimulus spending and convinced of Pentagon mismanagement, even under his own appointees, Mr. Trump was easy prey for Senator Rand Paul.<br />But reliance on arms-control deals with Russia is a fool’s paradise. Whatever relatively small near-term fiscal savings might accrue will be outweighed in the long term by increased threats not only from Moscow, but also from Beijing and rogue states aspiring to become nuclear powers.<br />Mr. Biden’s first arms-control decision will be whether and for how long to extend the New Start treaty. It expires Feb. 5, but can be extended for up to five more years, in whole or in part. The threat of the treaty’s expiration should be negotiating leverage for the U.S., but Mr. Biden appears certain to extend it in some form. Vladimir Putin recently proposed a one-year extension, perhaps worried he had received no signals from the president-elect. Mr. Biden should offer six months, thus keeping the heat on, and showing that his team will be more than stenographers for Moscow’s diplomats.<br />The hard policy questions are still the ones Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev and I discussed in August 2018, continued by Marshall Billingslea until the 2020 election rendered Mr. Trump a lame duck. Whether and how seriously Mr. Biden’s negotiators address these issues will determine whether a revised New Start agreement has any chance of being approved by the constitutionally required two-thirds Senate majority.<br />New Start has three broad substantive defects: It omits tactical nuclear weapons; it is technologically outdated and doesn’t address developments like hypersonic weapons; and China is not a signatory.</td>

      <td>The best argument for Donald Trump’s presidency was never about the man himself. It was about the people who voted for him.<br />It wasn’t really about what he would do for taxes, immigration or the federal judiciary. He did many needed things on those fronts for sure, but any clever Republican politician with a good pollster could have come up with that agenda. It wasn’t about his vaunted business experience and how he might inject a little necessary private-sector sense into a stultified bureaucracy. It certainly wasn’t about his penchant for conversation-dominating social-media expostulations—polls have indicated a consistent popular distaste for them.<br />The best argument for Donald Trump was that he led and gave voice to millions of Americans who had been leaderless and voiceless for decades. The secret people, as a British poet once described his similarly disdained countrymen—smiled at, paid, passed over. The deplorables. The men and women whom the media, entertainment and corporate human resources types never meet in their local Whole Foods but deride as bigots and brutish neanderthals.<br />People who had voted for Republicans and Democrats and had an increasingly hard time telling the difference. People who had voted for a “compassionate conservative,” who led the nation into a catastrophic and futile war. People who had voted for the nation’s first African-American president, a man promising hope and change but delivering hope mostly for those who had plenty of it already and change for few of those who really needed it.<br />These were Americans left behind by, or alarmed by, the unforgiving juggernaut of “progress” hailed by our political, business and cultural leaders as the glorious arc of history.</td>

Program officials had said four minutes would be the minimum time to gain confidence in the reliability of the engines, fuel system and surrounding structures.<br />National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said they couldn’t immediately determine the cause of the premature shutdown, and therefore it was too early to determine what fixes would be necessary or even if the test needed to be repeated. They said engineers didn’t know whether it was a hardware, software or sensor malfunction.<br />Boeing is the prime contractor for the mammoth Space Launch System booster, which is more powerful than the Saturn V that blasted Apollo astronauts toward the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was slated for its first uncrewed launch late this year, but that schedule is now in flux. Political and budget pressures on the program, projected to cost a total of between $19 billion and $23 billion to complete, were already increasing.<br />Departing NASA chief James Bridenstine repeatedly said in a news conference that the test shouldn’t be considered a failure, because engineers and program managers gained important data.

That will likely take growth in the pandemic-ravaged year to 2.2%—significantly lower than in 2019 but still leaving it the only major economy to advance in 2020.<br />Wednesday<br />Joe Biden is scheduled to be sworn in as president.

      <td>Producer transformed pop and rock with his ‘wall of sound’ technique; hits included ‘You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’’ and ‘Be My Baby’</td>
      <td>Phil Spector, a towering figure in the history of 20th-century pop music known for his symphonic “wall of sound” production technique, who later was convicted of second-degree murder, died Saturday at the age of 81.<br />The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed the death in a statement. The official cause of death hasn’t yet been determined. Since 2009, Mr. Spector had been serving a sentence of 19 years to life for the 2003 shooting death of actress Lana Clarkson at his home.<br />A legendary music producer, songwriter and musician, Mr. Spector, known for hits like “Be My Baby” and “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’,” created a lush, regal approach to music production whose extravagant orchestral arrangements and overpowering layers of sound shaped the pop and rock of the 1960s. More than any other producer of his time, Mr. Spector elevated the role of pop music in culture and transformed the recording studio into an instrument—all while capturing the crushes and breakups of teenagers. A kind of early rock star himself, he also cultivated an aura of mystique with his dark sunglasses.<br />In his later years, the reclusive producer’s musical contributions were overshadowed by his volatile behavior, including his abuse of former wife Ronnie Spector and murder of Ms. Clarkson, who was found shot to death in Mr. Spector’s mansion.<br />Born in New York City on Dec. 26, 1939, Mr. Spector formed a band in high school called the Teddy Bears and wrote and recorded the song “To Know Him Is To Love Him”; its title comes from the epitaph on his father’s gravestone. It topped the charts in 1958. After working with famed songwriter-producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, he issued a string of hits in the early to mid-1960s for acts such as the Crystals, the Ronettes and the Righteous Brothers.</td>

      <td>Far-right group invoked the president’s rhetoric to build momentum toward violent showdown, a Wall Street Journal review shows</td>
      <td>On Jan. 3, three days before the attack on the Capitol, Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the far-right organization known as the Proud Boys, shared a cryptic post on the messaging app Telegram: “What if we invade it?”<br />The message was sent to his more than 7,000 followers on the app, with the first reply reading “January 6th is D day in America.”<br />The Wall Street Journal reviewed thousands of posts from the Proud Boys and their members across Parler, Telegram and Gab, the social-media platforms where they rallied supporters online after mostly being banned from Facebook and  Twitter .  The messages show the group repeatedly invoking President Trump’s rhetoric in the weeks leading to the Jan. 6 protest as they built momentum toward what became a violent showdown.<br />Investigators have said they are scrutinizing online messages like these as they attempt to determine the planning and intent of those involved in the attack on the Capitol.<br />The Journal’s review, which included now-deleted posts that have been archived by researchers, suggests the Proud Boys viewed Mr. Trump’s messages as a call to action.</td>

      <td>The pandemic sped up demands for changes in the economic system. Shareholders might want to brace for change.</td>
      <td>The Covid crisis both accelerated demands for changes to the economic system and demonstrated that governments can spend freely to help those in trouble when they wish. Will capitalism be changed as a result?<br />To answer the question, it is worth looking back a decade to the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Occupy Wall Street was the protest group du jour, and governments had just allocated trillions of dollars to rescue the financial system. Aside from bank reforms, capitalism (though not global trade) survived pretty much unscathed. This time might be different, because the past decade has prepared the ground for a shift to more interventionist government. The stunning shareholder returns of the past decade hang in the balance.<br />Dominic Barton, then head of management consultants McKinsey & Co. and now Canada’s ambassador to China, summed up the view shared by many of capitalism’s winners in a 2011 article in the Harvard Business Review: “Business leaders today face a choice: We can reform capitalism, or we can let capitalism be reformed for us.”<br />Dozens of think tanks were formed in the 2010s to allow the world’s elite to discuss how to fix capitalism, roping in the pope and Britain’s Prince Charles to speak to corporate leaders. Thousands of environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds were set up, and many old unsuccessful funds had the label slapped on them to make them more attractive.<br />Even the Business Roundtable, the main U.S. corporate lobbying group, signed up for stakeholder capitalism, the idea of paying more attention to the needs of workers, local communities and the environment.</td>

Doria, who is expected to run for president next year, has led a partnership with Chinese company Sinovac Biotech Ltd. to test and produce CoronaVac in São Paulo, criticizing what he has called a “genocidal” lack of action by Mr. Bolsonaro.<br />The dispute comes as the country’s average daily death toll approaches 1,000 people, with scientists warning that a new variant that likely emerged in the Amazon could be partly responsible for a recent surge in infections. For the past week, Brazil has registered an average of more than 50,000 new cases of the disease each day—the highest since the pandemic began.</td>

      <td>Spending on oil production world-wide isn’t expected to climb back up to pre-pandemic levels through at least 2025</td>
      <td>Oil and gas prices are rebounding from their pandemic lows, but the road ahead for the industry remains challenging amid new competitive threats and demands from investors.<br />Global spending on oil and gas production is poised to remain below pre-pandemic levels through at least 2025, according to consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, as companies face pressure to improve returns and reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions. Meanwhile, investment in renewables and other clean energy technologies is taking off, threatening to eat into the market for oil and gas long-term.<br />Though oil prices have notched gains since November, they’re expected to remain below levels that support attractive returns, particularly for an industry still recuperating from last year’s historic drop in fuel demand.<br />As a result, companies aren’t rushing back into drilling. A third of oil producers surveyed by the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter said they planned to raise capital expenditures only slightly this year. About half said they would either keep spending flat or reduce investments.<br />Exxon Mobil Corp.  and  Chevron Corp.  cut plans to invest a combined $260 billion through 2025 to as low as $177 billion.</td>

      <td>Deferred concerts, delayed films, rescheduled books and canceled exhibitions: 2020 was a year of creativity postponed—which means 2021 just may be the most jam-packed year for entertainment in recent memory. As two years’ worth of albums finally drop and films land unconventional (but really-happening-this-time!) release dates, the year in culture is filled to the brim. But among the pack of creative voices, a dozen rise to the top: creators who could have a career-making 2021, whether for a spate of projects in the works (such as short stories, two follow-up novels and a screen adaptation from Booker Prize–shortlisted author Brandon Taylor) or the singular and magnetizing nature of a single show (Pakistani artist Salman Toor’s spellbinding Whitney Museum show, already a hit since its recent opening). Aubrey Plaza will make us laugh; Colman Domingo will make us cry (and collaborate with fellow listmaker Nia DaCosta in Candyman); Tainy’s music will get stuck in our heads. And we will marvel at the unclassifiable splendor of Japanese Breakfast.<br />Above all, we will celebrate a new year and a new vanguard of talent. WSJ.
