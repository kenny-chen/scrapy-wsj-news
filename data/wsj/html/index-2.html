      <td>The bank had said it would claw back or withhold $174 million in compensation from current, former executives</td>
      <td>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  slashed Chief Executive David Solomon’s 2020 pay by 36%, punishment for the bank’s admission last year that it broke U.S. laws in its dealings with an investment fund at the heart of a global corruption ring.<br />Mr. Solomon received a $17.5 million compensation package for 2020, down from the $27.5 million he got for 2019, according to a securities filing on Tuesday.<br />In October, Goldman agreed to pay nearly $3 billion to government officials in four countries to end an investigation into work it performed for 1MDB, a Malaysian fund that prosecutors had alleged was used to pay bribes to politicians in Malaysia and the Middle East. The bank said at the time that it would take a total of $174 million in compensation from current and former executives.<br />Mr. Solomon’s 2020 pay would have been $10 million higher but for the actions its board of directors took in response to the 1MDB saga, Goldman said in the filing. His compensation package consisted of a $2 million base salary, a $4.65 million cash bonus and a $10.85 million stock award that is tied to how well the bank performs over the next few years.<br />Costs and fines related to the fallout from the 1MDB scandal took a bite out of what was a banner year for Goldman’s businesses, which got a big boost from the markets’ bounceback from the depths of the coronavirus recession. Annual revenue of $44.56 billion was Goldman’s highest since 2009.</td>

Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), who is set to preside over the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, was taken to a local hospital for evaluation after feeling unwell, an aide said on Tuesday.<br />Mr. Leahy, 80 years old, felt unwell while in his Capitol office this evening, the aide said. “Out of an abundance of caution, the Attending Physician recommended that he be taken to a local hospital for observation, where he is now, and where he is being evaluated,” the aide said in a statement.<br />Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said in an interview on CNN that Mr. Leahy’s wife had indicated that “things are going well.” Mr. Durbin said that “we have all got our fingers crossed he will be back tomorrow.”<br />Mr. Leahy is the longest-serving Senate Democrat, having first been elected in 1974. He is third in line for the presidency after Vice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.)<br />The Constitution directs the chief justice of the United States to preside when the president is tried before the Senate, but is silent regarding former presidents. Chief Justice John Roberts presided over Mr. Trump’s first trial, which occurred when he was president.</td>

The Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said Mr. Hsieh died of complications of smoke inhalation and ruled the death an accident. The full autopsy report will be completed later this week but won’t be available to the public, the chief medical examiner said Tuesday.<br />A spokeswoman for the Hsieh family declined to comment, saying the family is “focused on their work to continue Tony’s legacy.”</td>

Before joining the coffeehouse chain, Ms. Brewer was CEO of  Walmart  Inc.’s  Sam’s Club division for five years.<br />Ms. Brewer, 58 years old, has been operating chief and a member of the board at Starbucks since 2017.

He must fulfill his promise, made during his campaign and inaugural address, to instill unity. Fixing our polarization demands something other than business as usual. It requires cultivating a nontribal, no-nonsense environment in which legislators have no option but to cooperate.<br />Mr. Biden should harness the presidential veto power to reject any legislation that doesn’t receive support from at least 20% of the opposition. The constraint would force lawmakers to come to creative compromises, crafting legislation that the broad majority of the country would support. This would set the tone for the American public, demonstrating that civility and cooperation are possible.</td>

      <td>Congress has a chance to repeal the 1887 Electoral Count Act.</td>
      <td>When Donald Trump addressed supporters in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 at a rally, he led them to believe they could change the 2020 election outcome. Yet states had certified results, lawsuits had run their course, and the Electoral College had voted. President Joe Biden’s inauguration was constitutionally inevitable.<br />The Trump camp was able to gin up false hope by exploiting ambiguities in the Electoral Count Act of 1887 (ECA). The law was intended to resolve contested presidential elections, but in the 21st century it has mainly been used by partisans in Congress to exploit the ceremonial process of counting electoral votes. Some Democrats took advantage of the ECA to cast doubt on legitimate results in 2001, 2005 and 2017, and far more Republicans did the same at Mr. Trump’s urging in 2021.<br />In the wake of the Capitol invasion, the ECA is ripe for an overhaul that reins in Congress’s increasingly destabilizing role in presidential elections. Repealing the law would make future challenges, even by the most willful candidates, less likely to spin out of control.<br />The ECA clashes with principles of federalism and the separation of powers. The Framers didn’t want the executive branch to be beholden to the legislative branch, so they designed an Electoral College to elect the President independent of Congress. Voters in each state register their choice for President by choosing a slate of electors, whose votes are then transmitted to Congress to be logged.<br />Yet the ECA allows Congress to unconstitutionally interfere with state decisions. Members of the House and Senate can claim electoral votes are not “regularly given” or “lawfully certified,” holding up the count and disqualifying electors if a majority in both houses agrees.</td>

      <td>A judge stops his deportation pause after the state of Texas sues.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump complained often about the frequency with which federal judges blocked his immigration orders, starting with his first sloppy travel ban in 2017. Now it’s President Biden’s turn, as a federal judge in Texas issued a temporary restraining order on Tuesday against Mr. Biden’s 100-day moratorium on deporting illegal aliens.<br />Judge Drew Tipton, a Trump appointee, issued the two-week TRO that applies nationwide and said he is considering a permanent injunction that would extend longer. The judge ruled on a suit filed by the state of Texas arguing that the deportation pause violates federal law that obligates the government to police illegal entry to the U.S. Judge Tipton said Mr. Biden’s order violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which is the same law that liberal judges used to issue nationwide injunctions against Mr. Trump’s rules.<br />The Biden Administration may appeal the ruling, and it pays to be skeptical these days when a judge issues a nationwide injunction. Too many judges have grown fond of the power to stop policies they don’t like. The truth in this case will require a more careful view of the legal arguments.<br />Meanwhile, the ruling is a blow to Mr. Biden’s early government by pen and phone, to borrow one of Barack Obama’s famous boasts. Mr. Biden’s pace of executive orders far outpaces Mr. Trump’s in his first week. Maybe he should slow down and make sure his orders are legally buttoned up.</td>

      <td>Businesses and workers hoping for a reprieve from Donald Trump's trade protectionism had a surprise this week as President Biden adopted his predecessor’s “Buy American” rules, only more so.<br />Rules that favor domestic companies in government procurement have been around since the New Deal. Mr. Trump issued three executive orders to toughen these requirements to promote U.S. manufacturing. Mr. Biden on Monday replaced those orders with his own supposedly tougher rules.<br />One rule would “increase the numerical threshold for domestic content requirements for end products and construction materials” and “increase the price preferences for domestic end products and domestic construction materials.” These thresholds vary by product, but increasing them will make government procurement more expensive and onerous.<br />About 97% of federal purchased goods are made by U.S. firms, but most include foreign-made components. U.S. auto makers source steel from Canada—often produced from U.S. scrap metal—engine components from Mexico, and computer chips from Taiwan. Mr. Biden wants to make federal contractors like Ford and  Caterpillar  buy more domestic components. But manufacturers require specific inputs and metal grades that are often only made abroad. Since the feds make up a tiny share of most U.S. companies’ sales, it doesn’t make sense to overhaul supply chains to comply with Made in America rules.<br />Mr. Biden says domestic content rules must be based on “the value that is added to the product through U.S.-based production or U.S. job-supporting economic activity.” But much of the value from tech equipment and even modern trucks derives from U.S. intellectual property. Will the Biden Administration refuse to buy iPads made overseas?</td>

Since Donald Trump is no longer president, Chief Justice John Roberts isn’t going to show up to preside.  Instead, the plan is for one of the Senate’s most ideological members to run the show.<br />Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), the chamber’s president pro tempore,  suggests in a tweet that he’s going to be even-handed:<br />Vermont’s senior senator is not exactly known for judiciousness. The Almanac of American Politics notes: “Leahy is a stalwart liberal known for periodic flashes of temper and can be a sharp-tongued partisan.” His voting record is barely distinguishable from that of his Vermont colleague, the socialist Sen.

      <td>His idea of ‘modernizing’ rules is to assert they have benefits that are ‘impossible to quantify.’</td>
      <td>Even in Washington, hardly anyone understands what the Office of Management and Budget does. Yet buried in the 2½-foot stack of President Biden’s first-day executive orders is hard evidence that someone in the new administration not only understands the OMB but knows how to use it. As a result, the business climate in this country will be made dramatically worse. Forget reregulation; this is the beginning of hyperregulation.<br />You probably didn’t pay attention to “Modernizing Regulatory Review,” a presidential memo released Jan. 20. Regulatory law is arcane and generally boring, but its effects can be monumental. Congress defers much of the actual work of governing—producing the rules and regulations that implement laws—to the executive branch. For decades the primary protection against an abuse of this power has been a requirement that a regulation’s costs must not outweigh its benefits. While each agency does its own cost-benefit analyses based on its own rules, OMB directs the agencies on how to do that and oversees the results. The new presidential memo tells OMB how to do that. The effects will filter down to every federal agency.<br />The presidential memo, similar to an executive order, is intended to “ensure that the review process promotes policies that reflect new developments in scientific and economic understanding, fully accounts for regulatory benefits that are difficult or impossible to quantify, and does not have harmful anti-regulatory or deregulatory effects” (emphasis added).<br />Translated from OMB-speak into English, that means throw out traditional measures, use anything you can possibly find to promote the benefit side of the cost-benefit analysis, and don’t do anything that might impair new regulation or remove old rules. The message from the Biden administration is that wherever cost-benefit analyses might create an impediment to regulation, OMB should feel free to throw out the math and use whatever it can find in the annals of some fringe academic journal to justify the new rules.<br />What is the scope of these changes? Pretty much everything: “These recommendations should provide concrete suggestions on how the regulatory review process can promote public health and safety, economic growth, social welfare, racial justice, environmental stewardship, human dignity, equity, and the interests of future generations,” the presidential memo instructs.</td>

      <td>I welcome President Biden’s calls for unity and his pledge to renew our hurting country, but I hope his administration doesn’t tear down a program that has brought hope to thousands of African-American children in the District of Columbia.<br />In 2004, Congress created the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. It provides scholarships of up to $13,742 for families in the nation’s capital earning less than 185% of the federal poverty level—the cutoff was $48,470 for a family of four in 2020—to select the school of their choice. In 2020-21, 82% of scholarship recipients identified as African-American and another 12% as Hispanic.<br />While scholarships for poor children of color should hold bipartisan appeal, the program has been a political football for years. The Obama administration repeatedly attempted to zero out funding for the opportunity scholarships, stopping only when congressional Republicans threw up roadblocks. The 2020 Biden-Sanders “unity” platform went out of its way to recommend defunding the program.<br />Critics claim the program and others like it undermine public schools by diverting taxpayer money. I don’t believe that’s true of any scholarship program, but it’s demonstrably false about this program, which Congress funds outside public school budgets.<br />I strongly support both public education and school choice. I attended public schools, and my father served as the first African-American school administrator in Little Rock, Ark.—for which my family received a burning cross on our front yard. But when my youngest child struggled in public schools and his teachers called him “incapable” of learning, he deserved other options.</td>

      <td>Biden should resist the temptation to go big, and focus instead on solutions with bipartisan support.</td>
      <td>So, Joe Biden wants to give immigration reform a go. Good luck, Mr. President, but recent history is not on your side and the timing is questionable at best.<br />I write that as someone who has been calling for decades for immigration reform that includes both better border security and conditional legalization for people who sneaked in. Our immigration system was designed to accommodate the economic needs of the 19th century, not the 21st, and major revisions are long overdue. The past three administrations tried and failed to get the job done.<br />George W. Bush had planned to make comprehensive border reform a first-term priority. As a former governor of a border state, he knew the issue inside and out. But the 9/11 attacks, the Iraq war, and low job-approval ratings in his second term conspired against him. Barack Obama chose to undertake legally suspect executive actions on immigration instead of negotiating a deal with Republicans in Congress. Donald Trump spent four years touting his “beautiful wall” and thrilling his base with anti-immigrant rhetoric.<br />Mr. Biden’s immigration proposal prioritizes an eight-year pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented aliens currently living here. “Unlike previous compromise bills,” the Journal reports, “Mr. Biden’s proposal lacks the countermeasures of increased security or deterrence at the border that Republicans have asked for in exchange for legalization.” In other words, Mr. Biden is calling for amnesty now and more border security at some unspecified future date. This is like a boxer leading with his chin.<br />Besides, the amnesty debate is largely a side issue. Simply legalizing the status of these migrants—most of whom have been in the country for more than a decade—won’t solve the larger problem, which is the imbalance between the number of visas available and the number of foreigners who want them. After World War II, the federal government’s Bracero program extended work visas to Mexican migrants to address a U.S. labor shortage, and the rate of illegal immigration plummeted. The program had its problems but ought to serve as a template. The biggest failure of the 1986 amnesty under Ronald Reagan was that it did little to expand ways to come lawfully. Mr. Biden should avoid making the same mistake.</td>

      <td>The word turns out to have two interrelated meanings: comfort and entertainment.</td>
      <td>When I recently read an article about “the movies of 2020 that gave us solace,” I asked: How can a movie give me solace? Solace is giving comfort to people in need of it.<br />It turns out that my reasoning was faulty, because for roughly 700 years solace has had two different meanings. The Oxford English Dictionary’s first definition of the noun solace is “Comfort, consolation; alleviation of sorrow, distress, or discomfort” and also “that which gives comfort.” The OED quotes Thomas à Kempis, who says in “The Imitation of Christ”: “God alone . . . is the solace of many souls.”<br />The second meaning: “Pleasure, enjoyment, delight; entertainment, recreation, amusement.” This meaning, which the OED says has been obsolete for 300 years, also goes back to the Middle Ages. William Langland says in “Piers Plowman” (1377): “God in his goodness . . . set him in solace and in sovereign mirth.” In the prologue to “The Canterbury Tales,” the narrator says he wants the pilgrims to tell tales “of best sentence and most solas,” by which he means they should be entertaining.<br />It seems odd to think of solace as either an attempt to comfort someone, which is a serious undertaking, or an attempt to amuse someone by telling a good story. Maybe the first meaning drove out the second meaning because the two meanings seem incompatible. But are they?<br />Why not think of giving solace as both comforting a person and telling him an amusing story? Merriam-Webster doesn’t think the notion of solace as amusement is obsolete. Its second definition of the verb is: “to make cheerful, amuse.” It quotes Wilkie Collins’s narrator in “The Moonstone”: “In this deplorable state . . . I solaced myself with the most composing pipe of tobacco I ever remember to have smoked in my life.”</td>

      <td>A British ﬁreﬁghter seeks to revive an ‘early Labour tradition that spoke to the patriotic and communitarian instincts’ of blue-collar families.</td>
      <td>George Bernard Shaw, though a Fabian socialist, brushed aside anyone who called him a “friend of the working classes.” He scoffed that he “had no other feeling for the working classes than an intense desire to abolish them and replace them by sensible people.” A century ago Britain’s Labour Party brought together the Fabians (who supplied the policy wonks) and the trade unions (who supplied the voters). The party had been founded to give working people a voice in politics, but gradually control passed to the university-educated, who were internationalist, technocratic and supremely confident that they could plan the future.<br />Then came two awful shocks. In the 2016 Brexit referendum, the Remainers won the affluent vote, but the working classes carried the Leavers to victory. And in the 2019 parliamentary election, the Tories swept depressed factory towns that had heretofore been safe for Labour. “You can’t trust the people,” snorted novelist Howard Jacobson. That’s what happens when the rabble are “given this new confidence in their own opinions.”<br />Paul Embery might be called a populist in America, but a more accurate label is “left conservative.” A firefighter, union official and lifelong Labour activist, he writes for the resolutely unorthodox webpaper UnHerd. And in “Despised: Why the Modern Left Loathes the Working Class,” he suggests that Bernard Shaw’s enormous condescension is now the dominant ideology of the progressive intelligentsia, which embraces every subcategory of identity politics except class identity. The endless squabbling among fractious identity groups “serves only to fragment the working class and undermine what should be the primary goal of developing common bonds and building the maximum unity required to defend its interests.” Somehow, “inclusivity” doesn’t include the workers.<br />Mr. Embery protests that the British tradition of vigorous debate—deeply rooted in union halls and worker-education classes as well as in Parliament—has given way to “echo chambers, ‘safe spaces’ and draconian hate legislation, all of which serve the purpose of suppressing unwelcome opinions and enforcing an official orthodoxy.” Arguably the stifling began when Tony Blair told the Labour Party that globalization was not open to discussion: “You might as well debate whether autumn should follow summer.”<br />But globalization meant the dissolution of close-knit blue-collar communities, and that pains Mr. Embery profoundly. He grew up in the vast East London Becontree Estate. When it opened in the 1920s, this was a model public-housing project, miraculously offering indoor toilets, running water, front and back gardens and public libraries. Strict regulations ensured that curtains were kept clean and hedges were neatly trimmed, but residents accepted these rules because they were enforced by a democratic local government and because they reflected the thoroughly bourgeois values of the British working classes. Mr. Embery, born in 1974, still knows the names of all his old neighbors: “People looked out for each other, and there was a tangible social solidarity.”</td>

Tipton of the Southern District of Texas granted the request for a two-week temporary restraining order after the Texas attorney general sued the new administration last Friday to ensure deportations would continue to be carried out. Judge Tipton said his order applied on a nationwide basis.<br />The court order was the first legal setback to President Biden’s immigration agenda, which already is coming under attack from Republicans, much as former President Donald Trump’s policies were challenged by Democratic officials.<br />The Biden administration on its first day announced the 100-day deportation moratorium, which was pushed by immigration activists and Mr. Biden’s rival in the Democratic primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.). The Department of Homeland Security began enforcing the pause Friday.<br />Judge Tipton, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in 2020, issued the order after concluding that Texas was likely to prevail on some of its legal claims. The judge said he would soon consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction that would block the new policy for a longer period.</td>

The call also focused on plans to extend a U.S.-Russia nuclear arms treaty for five years.<br />Mr. Biden voiced criticism of Mr. Putin throughout his presidential campaign, and the call represented his first opportunity as president to seek to establish a break from the frequently warm rapport between former President Donald Trump and the Russian leader. Mr. Biden, who as vice president held a face-to-face meeting with Mr. Putin in 2011, has warned Moscow that it could face additional sanctions for election interference if it is confirmed by U.S. intelligence officials.<br />During Mr. Trump’s presidency, some Democratic lawmakers accused the administration of pulling its punches against Moscow, as Mr. Trump rejected intelligence findings of Kremlin election interference. But Mr. Trump countered that his administration had levied more sanctions against Russia than previous administrations.<br />In the days before Mr. Biden’s inauguration, the Trump administration sanctioned seven men, including several former Ukrainian officials, for allegedly interfering in U.S. elections as agents of Russia’s government by promoting theories about Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter.</td>

National Guard, which she said he did. Mr. Sund also coordinated with acting Police Chief Robert Contee at the Metropolitan Police Department, she said.</td>

The Trump administration cut off funding to organizations that refer patients for abortions, and Planned Parenthood left the program known as Title X. An action related to Medicaid, a federal-state program for low-income and disabled people, is also expected.<br />While Mr. Biden agreed with some of Mr. Trump’s health-care initiatives, such as ending surprise medical billings and some antitrust actions to curb market concentration in the industry, the actions coming Thursday are aimed at unraveling his predecessor’s stamp on health care. The moves are spurring criticism from conservative and antiabortion groups that have opposed the ACA and lauded restrictions on federal funding for abortion.<br />Mr. Trump had pledged to repeal the ACA and replace it with a better alternative but failed to do either. He supported key parts of a lawsuit from a coalition of Republican-led states to invalidate the ACA, which the Supreme Court is weighing.</td>

The company has paid more than $30 billion in fines and settlements because of the scandal, including some $23 billion in the U.S.<br />At issue is a June decision by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that ruled two counties have authority alongside the federal Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the updates that car manufacturers make to emissions systems in vehicles after they are sold. Florida’s Hillsborough County and Salt Lake County in Colorado are seeking daily penalties of $5,000 per rigged diesel car for the local pollution they caused, with potential yearly damages of $11.2 billion.<br />Volkswagen argues it shouldn’t have to pay those fines because the court decision misinterprets the federal Clean Air Act, which it says gives sole regulatory authority over manufacturer changes to car emissions to the EPA and California. The company argues that the EPA approved a software update Volkswagen made to the cars before the diesel-emissions scandal broke, and that its move isn’t akin to something a county could regulate, such as a local mechanic tampering with emissions.<br />To date, the company has entered into $23 billion worth of civil and criminal settlements with federal and state regulators and drivers of nearly 600,000 U.S. diesel vehicles. Those agreements didn’t prevent some states and local governments from separately suing Volkswagen, lawsuits the company has won in Alabama, Tennessee and Minnesota.</td>

International passenger demand in November was down 88% from year-earlier levels, according to the latest figures from the International Air Transport Association.<br />But as health officials worry that new coronavirus variants may be more contagious, more deadly or less responsive to vaccines, governments are taking measures ranging from outright bans on international flights to universal testing requirements in effort to contain further spread.<br />Jeffrey Ward, a travel adviser who helps people plan luxury trips, said the biggest fear for many travelers residing in the U.S is getting stuck abroad if they test positive for Covid-19, given new U.S. rules requiring passengers to test negative before boarding a flight. He has steered some toward Hawaii for their beach vacations instead of international destinations.

Mr. Biden’s supporters issued a 110-page set of mutually agreeable policy plans—or as National Public Radio called it last July, “a blueprint for a progressive presidency.” Sen. Sanders gushed that, “On issue after issue, whether it was education, the economy, health care, climate, immigration, criminal justice, I think there was significant movement on the part of the Biden campaign.” Some of us on the right suspect that policy plans halfway between Sen. Sanders and President Biden have zero unifying appeal to red-staters.<br />President Biden’s record-setting first day of executive orders contributed to a foreboding sense that red-blue unity was possible only if conservatives moved far left. For example, “noncitizens” in the U.S. (primarily people who crossed the U.S. border illegally) will be included in the census count used to apportion congressional representatives. The more noncitizens hosted by a state, the more power that state has in Congress and the more federal funds it is likely to receive. Priorities of the Biden-Sanders unity plan include massive investment in green infrastructure, a new public-health insurance option, Medicare-for-60 (instead of 65), installation of a half-billion solar panels and unionization of jobs in the clean-energy economy. If red-blue unity is centered on Biden-Sanders unity, no thanks. NPR concluded last July that a Biden presidency will arrive “with bold progressive ambitions.” Wrapping bold progressivism in red-blue unity garb is unappealing to about half the country.<br />Dana Davis<br />St. Augustine, Fla.<br /></td>

After all, Ms. Stefanik wanted Congress to determine whether there was any basis in evidence that would support, or eliminate, concerns regarding our last presidential election.

The service disruptions came during a period of frenetic trading, largely driven by individual investors.<br />“These outages generate annoyance among investors in the short term,” said William Trout, director of wealth management at Javelin Strategy & Research. “Longer-term, outages call into question the stability of these platforms, even if the need for greater capacity can be addressed.”<br />The outages also can take their toll on the markets themselves, especially at a time when individual investors’ interest in stocks has touched levels unseen in decades, he said. Robinhood Markets Inc. and other popular trading platforms experienced outages last spring, when concerns over the pandemic and its effect on the economy triggered the worst stock-market selloff since Black Monday.<br />The market snapped back almost as quickly, drawing in many first-time stock traders. And with many Americans transitioning to remote work, those investors had more time to pore over their brokerage accounts and place their bets. Their enthusiasm, along with efforts by brokers to beef up their platforms, so far has offset clients’ frustration with temporary outages. But repeated problems will test their patience and draw regulators’ attention, Mr. Trout said.</td>

      <td>Lawmakers turn toward process called budget reconciliation that requires simple majority vote</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats are weighing aggressive use of existing procedural steps to enact President Biden’s coronavirus relief plan as Republican opposition to the $1.9 trillion proposal hardens.<br />Republicans have balked at much of Mr. Biden’s plan, meaning Democrats are likely to eventually move to a process called budget reconciliation to pass at least part of the legislation with a simple majority in the Senate. Reconciliation typically limits a bill to tax and spending measures, which means that stimulus checks, the child tax credit and unemployment insurance in Mr. Biden’s proposal would almost surely fit within its restrictions.<br />But some in the party want to go further, exploring ways to stretch the rules and precedents that have historically constrained what policy provisions are allowed under the reconciliation process. Some see it as a way to pass party priorities like raising the minimum wage without ending the filibuster, the Senate rule that in practice means most legislation requires 60 votes to advance.<br />“Time is of the essence to address this crisis. We’re keeping all options open on the table, including using budget reconciliation,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Tuesday. Mr. Schumer said the Senate could begin the reconciliation process for Mr. Biden’s relief plan as soon as next week.<br />For now, the Biden administration is urging a bipartisan approach on the coronavirus relief bill, the sixth relief round Congress has taken up since the pandemic began. In a call with top White House officials Sunday, members of both parties said they favored a bipartisan agreement. Lawmakers discussed a narrower bill focused on money for vaccines as a possible area of agreement that could leave other items for a subsequent reconciliation bill.</td>

      <td>On Syfy, Alan Tudyk plays an alien set on destroying the Earth, but first he must disguise himself as a physician, learn to speak English and drink whiskey.</td>
      <td>As immigration stories go, “Resident Alien” isn’t exactly an argument for open borders. Harry Vanderspeigle has, after all, arrived in snowy Patience, Colo., with the express purpose of wiping out all of humankind. His orders from home instruct him to instigate a “full extinction event.” He’s not really interested in assimilation.<br />On the other hand, he’s not actually Harry Vanderspeigle: The real Dr. Harry (Alan Tudyk), an only occasional visitor to Patience, becomes an early casualty of intergalactic hostilities when he’s pitched out the window of his vacation cabin and into the lake by an his alien attacker who assumes the ice will keep the late doctor fresh, and hidden, at least until spring. That accomplished, our alien, who has crash-landed and lost his “device” (the bomb that will obliterate Earth), assumes Harry’s shape, learns human language from watching Jerry Orbach on “Law & Order,” and before anything else can happen is enlisted into public service in a town offbeat enough to assume its strange new physician-psychiatrist is simply, as they say, out there.<br />Based on the Dark Horse comics series co-created by Peter Hogan and Steve Parkhouse, “Resident Alien” carries echoes of many entertainments past, notably the old Peter Sellers movie “Being There,” in which the utterances of an idiot were presumed to be profound, and the erstwhile CBS TV series “Northern Exposure,” whose fish-out-of-water story also took place in a remote locale that needed a doctor and was eccentric enough to accept more eccentricity. Harry (Mr. Tudyk, naturally) is not just an oddball: Missions are subject to change, but his initial intent is to keep his identity secret, kill the one little boy (Judah Prehn) who can see the homicidal alien below Harry’s human disguise, find his device, blow up Earth, and do it all before the real Dr. Harry bobs to the surface.<br />The snag: The town’s regular resident doctor has suddenly turned up mysteriously dead. Harry, who in this case is not the killer, is dragooned by the belligerent Sheriff Mike Thompson (Corey Reynolds) into performing the autopsy. Which gets him far more involved in local events—and the local people—than is wise for a genocidal extraterrestrial.<br />Among all the secret weapons inhabiting “Resident Alien” the principal one is Mr. Tudyk, who often provides voices for animated series (“American Dad!” “Robot Chicken,” “Rick and Morty”) but can assume the otherworldly look, and charms, of a creature cut loose from his reality. I have an indelible memory of him in the original “Death at a Funeral,” as the fiancé who is inadvertently given a hallucinogenic and ends up naked on a roof. He is required, similarly, in “Resident Alien” to play much of Harry’s character straight-faced, though Mr. Tudyk’s face is never quite straight and he occasionally gets to be hilarious, such as when the infinitely patient-in-Patience nurse Asta Twelvetrees (Sara Tomko) and the bartender D’arcy (Alice Wetterlund) introduce him to alcohol. “I’ll say one thing about whiskey,” he tells himself a little later. “It’s allowing me to make smart, rational decisions,” at which point he breaks into the kid’s house and tries to kill him. “There’s an alien under my bed,” young Max tells his mom and dad (Meredith Garretson, Levi Fiehler), who smile indulgently, pooh-pooh the very idea and take him to sleep with them. Close calls are a regular part of life in Harry’s small-town America.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden on Tuesday signed a series of executive orders that are intended to advance racial equity, including action to phase out the federal use of private prisons.<br />“The simple truth is, our soul will be troubled as long as systemic racism is allowed to persist,” Mr. Biden said in remarks at the White House. “It’s corrosive, it’s destructive and it’s costly.”<br />“We’re also less prosperous. We’re less successful. We’re less secure,” he added. “We must change.”<br />Mr. Biden signed a mandate directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development to examine housing policies that disproportionately affect people of color. And he took action to end the Justice Department’s use of private prisons in a return to an Obama-era policy.<br />Then-President Barack Obama’s Justice Department in 2016 said private prisons had more safety and security problems than those run by the U.S. government and moved to phase them out. Former President Donald Trump’s administration reversed that policy, saying the Federal Bureau of Prisons needed to be able to contract with private companies to meet its future needs.</td>

      <td>Naomi Watts stars as a recently-disabled mother whose family takes in an injured magpie.</td>
      <td>Given the intoxicating vistas of “Penguin Bloom,” the romping children on endless Australian beaches, the couple in love and the wistful kid’s voice saying “Everything was pretty much perfect,” you can rest assured that everything’s going south in a matter of moments. And when a movie is “based on a true story,” you can also depend on certain elements being elastic, while the more implausible ones are absolutely true.<br />The unlikeliest aspect of “Penguin Bloom” is the title character, a magpie who will come to be known as Penguin after falling out of a nest and seizing the attentions of the three Bloom boys, Reuben, Oli and Noah (Felix Cameron, Abe Clifford-Barr, Griffin Murray-Johnston). This occurs despite—or more likely because—their mother, Sam (Naomi Watts), has broken her back: During a family vacation in Thailand, she leans on a rotten railing, plummets from a terrace and fractures what she describes as her “bra strap” vertebrae. This transforms her from a surfer mom who keeps an idyllic home in New South Wales into an invalid who, when not assisted by her devoted husband, Cameron (Andrew Lincoln), has to drag herself out of bed and into her wheelchair. She’s wondering why she gets up at all. Her boys are just confused, especially Noah, who blames himself for his mom’s mishap.<br />Based on a book by Cameron Bloom and Bradley Trevor Greive, “Penguin Bloom” isn’t particularly preoccupied with how the bird saves the family; the family really saves itself. But the film is visually lush, not only in the panoramic use of Sydney’s Northern Beaches but of the interiors of the Bloom household, which is ramshackle in a we-live-on-the-beach-but-have-help sort of way. The family keeps bees, which isn’t a plot point, but it explains the kitchen being so full of honey that it burnishes the light; when Sam, in a pique, knocks a jar off the counter to give her impossible mother, Jan (Jacki Weaver), something to do, the result is a syrupy mix of glass, light and the suggestion that beauty can be found in small, unlikely things, even if we viewers are the only ones seeing it at that particular time.<br />That said, “Penguin Bloom” director Glendyn Ivin doesn’t honey-coat the difficulties faced by Sam or her family, which is one of his film’s virtues. The physical trials of Sam are treated quite frankly. It’s probably true, and perhaps ironic, that an actress has to be quite physically fit to convincingly play someone with Sam’s sort of disability. Ms. Watts gives a memorable performance. So does the bird, for different reasons: The Blooms have certainly led a casual kind of existence, but the idea of a wild bird free-ranging it all over one’s home kept me distracted because one, it should have been messier, and two, when avian hygiene is in fact addressed, the kids never properly clean up after it.<br />But of course Penguin is meant as a distraction, for the Blooms and for us, as we all navigate the emotional journey of Sam, making her way to acceptance and finding new ways to live. “Penguin Bloom” is alternately despairing and inspiring—more of the former than the latter, I found, simply because of the production’s honesty, and the lifetime of difficulty the Blooms’ story suggests. “I consider myself the luckiest man alive,” Cameron says to Sam during one of her bluer moments, to which she responds “Oh, shut up,” which rings right and appropriate and certainly seems based on a true story.</td>

      <td>Congressional Democrats propose phasing in higher pay floor over five years</td>
      <td>President Biden wants to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, and Democratic allies in Congress released new details Tuesday on legislation to lift the wage floor in phases over five years. The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 an hour since 2009, with a patchwork of states increasing the wage floor above that minimum.<br />Here is what we know about the status of the $15 minimum-wage proposal:<br />Mr. Biden in two recent speeches called for a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, which requires action by Congress. A bill introduced by Democrats this week would increase the wage floor to $15 an hour in phases over five years, starting at $9.50 an hour the day a new law becomes effective. Annual increases would follow until reaching $15 an hour, then the rate would be reviewed annually and adjusted based on changes to median hourly earnings of all employees.<br />Democrats also proposed gradual elimination of subminimum wages for workers who are in part paid through tips. That minimum wage for adult workers is currently $2.13 an hour. The bill also eliminates separate subminimum wages for youth and disabled workers.<br />Democrats say raising the minimum wage will help lift the lowest-wage workers out of poverty and give them more spending power. The proposal matches a level long backed by labor unions.</td>

      <td>Adapting to life at sea wasn’t easy for L.A. comic Mike Siegel, then Covid sunk the cruise industry</td>
      <td>IN THE SUMMER of 2015, I performed stand-up comedy on a TV talent competition. The morning after it aired, the phone rang. The man on the other end was a Florida-based talent agent with a proposition: “Ever think about doing cruises?”<br />The truth was that I hadn’t thought about cruises much. I’d taken exactly one cruise in my life 30 years ago with some college friends on a weeklong booze-fueled lap around the Caribbean. Though I’m hazy on details, I do remember finding the cruise experience confining, overly structured and, I’ll say it, boring. Toss in my penchant for motion sickness, and I never returned to the open seas.<br />But work is work and the money being offered was decent. I took the gig, knowing it came with strings attached. Most cruise ships want clean, family-friendly acts: no swearing, politics, religion, or overtly sexual material. Such rules are the reason many comics won’t (or can’t) do cruises.<br />I’m considered a clean act in comedy clubs, but I still got reprimanded on my first cruise for material that would barely raise an eyebrow from “The Tonight Show” censors. It’s not uncommon to walk on a ship’s stage to see three generations of the same family in the front row, complete with dozing grandparents and restless toddlers. It’s the only time I envy clowns.<br />My seasickness was also a real concern at first, but I’m proud to say I never “fed the fish” in my four years of cruising. The massive size of most modern cruise ships helps considerably in reducing the motion of the ocean, but the smaller the ship, the rougher it can get.</td>

The sprawling investigation includes FBI agents who normally handle a range of other matters, including securities fraud, public corruption, drugs, and gangs, the filings show.<br />FBI field offices from Arizona to New York have fanned out to make arrests, search homes and interview witnesses, family members and associates. Homeland security agents and local law enforcement have also taken part in the investigation, according to the filings and people involved.<br />Current and former law-enforcement officials said the effort was comparable with some of the largest investigations in the FBI’s recent history, such as the Oklahoma City bombing and the Boston Marathon attack. The result has been a rapid-fire series of criminal complaints, arrest and search warrants, and grand jury indictments, with more arrests expected. The effort is aimed at deterring future efforts to besiege the capital and to root out dangerous groups, the officials said.<br />“The scope and scale of this investigation and these cases are really unprecedented not only in FBI history, but probably DOJ history,” said Michael Sherwin, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, which is overseeing the prosecutions. Speaking at a recent news conference, Mr. Sherwin said there were thousands of potential witnesses and likely hundreds of criminal cases.</td>

      <td>The U.S. division of French beauty products maker  L’Occitane International SA  has filed for bankruptcy, behind on $15 million in rent and seeking to shed lease obligations after the Covid-19 pandemic cut into sales.<br />The U.S. unit L’Occitane Inc., which operates 166 boutiques in 36 states and Puerto Rico, filed a chapter 11 petition Tuesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Trenton, N.J., for the purpose of relieving itself of what it called increasingly untenable lease obligations.<br />Like other retailers, L’Occitane has been hurt by the pandemic, which has made consumers less willing to shop in person, according to a declaration filed in bankruptcy court by Yann Tanini, regional managing director for L’Occitane.<br />The company filed court papers seeking to reject 29 “burdensome” lease agreements and exit from those locations, where it said its rent obligations “no longer reflect the market.”<br />L’Occitane joins the ranks of a growing number of retailers, from huge department-store chains such as  J.C. Penney Co.  to boutiques like Sur La Table Inc., to have filed for chapter 11 during the pandemic.</td>

      <td>The agreements are in response to shareholder proposals from AFL-CIO's reserve fund</td>
      <td>Five of the largest U.S. banks publicly committed to mandating a diverse slate of applicants when hiring employees, part of a push to diversify an industry whose top ranks remain largely white and male.<br />JPMorgan Chase  & Co.,  Bank of America Corp. ,  Citigroup Inc.,   Wells Fargo  & Co. and  U.S. Bancorp  all said they would either adjust policies for considering job candidates or disclose the ones they already have in place.<br />Their policies mirror the so-called Rooney Rule, which started in the National Football League as a way of making sure people of color are considered for coaching jobs. In recent years, the rule has gained traction in corporate America, particularly for boards of directors.<br />The commitments came about after the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, a union group, sent proposals to the banks in its capacity as a shareholder. The group owns shares through its reserve fund. That led to discussions and a series of agreements, according to Brandon Rees, deputy director of corporations and capital markets at AFL-CIO.<br />Banks say they already had interview policies to diversify their ranks, but the public agreements are meant to add an element of accountability for their progress. Over the summer, racial justice protests drew attention to structural barriers for people to color to advance in corporate America. At banks, where women and minorities have long struggled to ascend to the top ranks, attention turned to hiring practices.</td>

      <td>Johnson & Johnson’s underlying business looks as strong as ever as it awaits late-stage Covid-19 vaccine data expected next week</td>
      <td>Johnson & Johnson  stock hasn’t yet caught the eyes of Reddit day traders. But the business outlook for the health-care giant is as bright as ever.<br />The company said Tuesday that it expects to book between $88.8 billion and $90 billion in 2021 sales, after adjusting for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign-exchange effects. That is good for a growth rate of about 8% from last year. Johnson & Johnson also expects adjusted earnings of about $9.50 a share, which would be nearly 20% growth. Shares rallied in morning trading.<br />A gradual return to normal in the medical-devices business segment is a big part of that formula: The onset of Covid-19 and resulting disruptions to elective surgical procedures led to a 10.5% sales decline in 2020 from a year earlier. That improved to just a 1.5% decline in the fourth quarter, however. There should be further upside ahead, as sales in some device categories like vision and orthopedics have been slower to recover. Finance Chief Joseph Wolk said in an interview that short-term weakness didn’t affect any long-term business opportunity, as research-and-development spending actually grew by $800 million in 2020 from a year ago.<br />Shares are trading at about 18 times this year’s adjusted profit forecast, a fairly sober valuation in a wild market.<br />The company’s guidance leaves other sources of potential upside. It certainly has the firepower to make a large pharmaceutical or medical-device acquisition should it choose to do so: Johnson & Johnson ended the year with $10 billion in net debt on its books, or half the free cash flow generated in 2020.</td>

      <td>When “WandaVision” head writer Jac Schaeffer and her team were writing Marvel’s new series, they worked out of a windowless office at the studio’s headquarters. Writers weren’t permitted to bring drafts home. Manuscripts  were watermarked. Ms. Schaeffer had to memorize a code for her “scary black hard drive.” She was afraid to dictate ideas into voice memos for fear that they might find their way on to the internet.<br />“Marvel’s so locked up with the secrecy, it terrifies me,” says Ms. Schaeffer, who received a “created for television” credit for the series and is an executive producer.<br />Ms. Schaeffer’s “WandaVision,” which premiered this month, is the first original Marvel Studios series for Disney+. It plops Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany), two characters from the multibillion-dollar “Avengers” franchise, into the golden age of television. In the first three episodes, the couple has gone from being perceived by neighbors and colleagues as suspiciously childless during the black-and-white, Dick Van Dyke era, to becoming parents of twins living a colorful life reminiscent of “The Brady Bunch.”<br />Ms. Schaeffer—whose screenwriting credits include “The Hustle,” a gender-reversed remake of “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels”—wasn’t obsessed by comics and superheroes as a girl. But when doors in Hollywood started opening wider for women, she found a place at Marvel.<br />“I came to learn pretty quickly that the sprawling mythology of [the Marvel Cinematic Universe] is the ultimate playground for storytelling,” she says.</td>

However, it remains below the October level of 101.4, which was the highest since the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S., and February’s pre-pandemic level of 132.6.<br />The January increase was driven by consumers’ more upbeat outlook for the economy and jobs, suggesting they foresee conditions improving in the not-too-distant future, said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board.<br />“In addition, the percent of consumers who said they intend to purchase a home in the next six months improved, suggesting that the pace of home sales should remain robust in early 2021,” Ms. Franco said.</td>

      <td>More sensors, missiles and other assets in the region will help deter China from a costly island invasion.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration faces a stark reality: Over the next four years it’s possible that China will try to take Taiwan. For the first time since 1950, Beijing may reasonably think it has a viable military option to force what it regards as a renegade province to heel. President Xi Jinping has said Taiwan must be part of China—and has signaled he intends to do something about it.<br />The stakes for America are immense. Keeping Taiwan out of Beijing’s grip is crucial for denying China’s goal of attaining regional hegemony and eventually global pre-eminence. The island occupies a pivotal geographic position. If Taiwan falls, China would have the ability to project military power throughout Asia. Japan, the Philippines, Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands would all be more vulnerable to China’s military.<br />The U.S. has long opposed China’s belligerence toward Taiwan, and states in the region would read the U.S. response to an attack as a bellwether of American reliability. Forgoing Taiwan’s defense would seriously undermine America’s credibility among already nervous Asian allies and partners. For these reasons, the recently declassified 2018 Indo-Pacific strategy specifically ordered the Pentagon to implement a defense strategy that will make the U.S. capable of defending Taiwan.<br />But can America even defend Taiwan from a China that has become so powerful? The People’s Liberation Army is growing stronger at an astonishingly fast rate. The PLA Navy already has more ships than the U.S. Navy, its air forces are the largest in the region, and Beijing also boasts the world’s largest missile force. Beijing seeks to reach technical parity with America’s armed forces by the 2020s, and surpass us by 2030.<br />Despite all this, the answer is yes. Defeating a PLA attack would be far from easy or cheap, and being ready to do so will involve wrenching changes in the U.S. and Taiwanese defense establishments. But it is doable.</td>

      <td>People who didn’t get the full relief payments can get the remainder on their 2020 tax returns—if they qualify</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Internal Revenue Service is basically done sending out stimulus checks, after finishing a first round in the spring and summer and a second round in December and January. But there are still billions of dollars that some households can claim—through their 2020 tax returns.<br />Here are some key questions and answers:<br />No. The first round was $1,200 per adult and $500 per child and the second was $600 per adult and $600 per child. Anyone who received all of that money doesn’t need to do anything. And the stimulus payments aren’t taxable income.<br />There are several categories of people who might not have received their full stimulus payments. Because the payments were based on 2018 or 2019 income and household size, some people may be eligible based on their 2020 status—even if they weren’t eligible for an upfront payment.<br />That can happen if income changed. The payments start phasing out when income reaches $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples. So a single person who earned $125,000 in 2018 and 2019 and $70,000 in 2020 would have received no payments but would be able to claim both stimulus payments on the 2020 tax return for a total of $1,800.</td>

      <td>UBS  is in less need of strong management than most of its European peers—which is fortunate given the awkward position of its new boss.<br />On Tuesday, the Switzerland-based bank announced excellent full-year results, with profits up across the group. Chief executive Ralph Hamers, who took the reins in November, also gave hints of a new strategy he hopes to announce next quarter.<br />His plans were unfortunately overshadowed by December’s surprise decision by the Netherlands to open a new inquiry into Mr. Hamers’ role in a money-laundering scandal at his former employer, ING. The matter was previously thought to have been settled before his hiring. The investigations, which typically take about 18 months, are an unwelcome source of uncertainty for UBS’s investors.<br />The bank’s strategy involves integrating wealth management, investment banking and asset management to serve high-net-worth individuals globally, with a special focus on growth in Asia. Any leader is likely to build on that successful formula rather than reinvent it. Mr. Hamers highlighted three focus areas: improving technology investment, re-evaluating subscale markets and forging a more unified, agile corporate culture.<br />The technology focus isn’t a surprise. Mr. Hamers was hired for his expertise in digital transformation, and all banks are investing in technology to cut costs and improve products. He won’t spend more money, but rather shift to shorter-term projects and quarterly, instead of annual funding decisions.</td>

      <td>Tired of being cooped up in an apartment and eager for a fresh start to the new year, Karen Fine, a schoolteacher in Chicago, is planning a family vacation…to Chicago.<br />Next month, Ms. Fine, husband Eric Fine and their children Asher, 8, Molly, 7, and Lucy, 4, will pack up the car and drive 2 miles away to a hotel downtown, where they spent Christmas Eve in December. Plans include swimming in the hotel pool and drinking hot chocolate while watching movies in their room. On Saturday they’ll do some window shopping on Michigan Avenue followed by an afternoon outing to a bowling alley.<br />“It will break up the monotony of waking up every day and it’s Groundhog Day,” says Ms. Fine, a 40-year-old Spanish teacher who spends most of her workday alone in front of a computer, leading virtual classes to mostly ninth- and 10th-graders. By going to a hotel, says Asher, the couple’s third-grader, “you get a break from your house.”<br />Right now, the pandemic--along with social and political unrest—have Americans going a little stir crazy. And January can be hard even in normal times. “There is a subconscious kind of depression we get coming off the high from the holidays,” says John Dick, chief executive of CivicScience, a Pittsburgh consumer-research firm. The company surveyed nearly 3,000 adults between Jan. 8 and Jan. 11, with 27% of the respondents saying they felt the “post-holiday blues” more than last year.<br />Some families have taken matters into their own hands, making plans for wintertime events and getaways to bring back the joy. On the list are celebratory gatherings with friends, neighbors and co-workers, as well as “some day” vacations for when it’s safer to travel. Even hotels are retooling their offerings, giving fidgety families special programs at weekday rates. Just having something on the calendar to look forward to can perk up spirits.</td>

      <td>Malcolm Butler is the president and CEO of the Fiduciary Group in Savannah, Ga.<br />While awaiting the recent birth of my first granddaughter, I spent a lot of time thinking about the best possible gift I could give her. Ultimately, I decided that the ideal present for my grandchild was to give her parents–my daughter and her husband–a professionally drafted estate plan.<br />New parents can be overwhelmed with the incredible responsibilities associated with caring for a newborn, so they aren’t always thinking about the importance of drafting wills and other estate-planning documents. According to a 2020 Caring.com survey, only 16.4% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 and 27.2% of Americans between the ages of 35 and 54 have estate-planning documents. Dying without a will can lead to serious financial problems and burden surviving family members with avoidable stress. For example, if new parents don’t appoint a guardian in a legally binding will, a judge could ultimately decide who will raise their children in the event that the parents pass away before the children reach the age of majority.<br />In addition, given the financial demands associated with raising a child, new parents can be short on cash and tend to postpone spending money on expenses not seen as necessary and immediate. Investment-savvy grandparents should consider gifting an estate plan in order to make sure that their grandchildren are adequately protected in the event of the premature death of their parents.<br />High net-worth investors already understand the importance of strategy, planning and adhering to a long-term perspective. Those same principles apply when it comes to gifting an estate plan because you are, in essence, taking steps to prepare for various future contingencies and to ensure that your grandchild will be protected, both financially and personally, in the event of an unforeseen emergency affecting your adult child and his or her spouse.</td>

He urged companies to make clear how they were preparing for a global regime focused on “net zero” goals to emit no more carbon dioxide than it removes from the atmosphere by 2050, a priority in line with the Paris climate accord.<br />One of President Biden’s first acts in office was getting the U.S. to rejoin the climate accord, signaling the administration’s heightened focus on companies’ carbon footprint. Some regulators said that climate risks’s effects on the financial system need to be better understood.<br />“Better sustainability disclosures are in companies’ as well as investors’ own interests,”  Mr. Fink said in a letter released to chief executives of companies Tuesday. “I urge companies to move quickly to issue them rather than waiting for regulators to impose them.”<br />The company told clients it would flag companies that posed significant climate risk for potential selling from its actively-managed portfolios. It also planned to publish the proportion of its assets “aligned to net zero” and goals on that metric going forward.</td>

      <td>With spring training three weeks away, MLB owners want to delay opening day, while the players union prepares for a full season</td>
      <td>With coronavirus infections dipping nationwide, one might think Major League Baseball’s owners would feel a bit more optimistic about spring training starting in a few weeks. Instead, they want to delay or even shorten the upcoming season, hoping that widespread vaccine distribution would create safer conditions for players and allow fans to buy tickets to attend again.<br />The Players Association, however, argues that MLB has no legal grounds to deviate from the 2021 schedule that has been set since July without its consent and expects to push ahead with a full slate. The union has indicated that it has no intention of accepting a deal that results in players receiving anything less than 100% pay, after they received 37% of their salaries during last year’s 60-game campaign in empty stadiums.<br />The brewing conflict raises the prospect of Round 2 of a bitter pandemic dispute from last spring, which threatened to derail the entire season and further damaged the industry’s contentious labor relations. This time, the stakes are even higher: The current collective bargaining agreement expires on Dec. 1, with the reality of a work stoppage in 2022 becoming increasingly realistic as trust between the two sides deteriorates beyond its already-fractured state.<br />Internally, MLB recognizes that it has little recourse to unilaterally impose a schedule of fewer than 162 games. That’s why commissioner Rob Manfred has instructed teams to plan for camps across Arizona and Florida to open on time.<br />In a statement, MLB said it would “continue to consult with public health authorities, medical experts, and the Players Association” about whether any schedule modifications should be made. The MLBPA said, “While we, of course, share the goals of a safe spring training and regular season, MLB has repeatedly assured us that it has instructed its teams to be prepared for an on-time start.”</td>

      <td>Thousands of actors, musicians and other creative professionals in New York City are at risk of losing or have already lost their health-care coverage because of coronavirus-related shutdowns.<br />With Broadway and other theater closures now stretching past 10 months, actors and others in the industry have limited options for keeping their health insurance, which is often provided through union plans that offer coverage based on time worked. Enrollment through the Actors’ Equity Association, which covers actors and stage managers, has already dropped by nearly a quarter, with 5,509 members covered at the start of this year compared with more than 7,200 at the end of 2019.<br />Officials estimate enrollment will continue dropping by about 10% monthly, with just over 4,000 members covered at the end of March, according to a spokesman for the Equity-League Benefit Funds, a separate organization that governs the union members’ benefit programs. Members need to work a minimum number of weeks to qualify for six months to a year of coverage, and in normal times performers often take on extra jobs to make sure they hit the threshold.<br />The fund receives 88% of its funding from employer contributions and officials project its reserve levels will decline to $30 million by the middle of the year if live performances don’t return to near-normal levels, compared with $120 million before the pandemic hit. As a result, trustees voted to increase premiums and raise the eligibility threshold for coverage.<br />“We understand that, without the ability to work, many participants may not qualify for coverage under any realistic benefit plan we could devise and financially sustain,” the funds’ trustees said in a statement. “Sadly, there is nothing the Health Fund can do to affect the course of the pandemic or to accelerate the safe reopening of live theater.”</td>

      <td>Demand for Xbox gaming consoles has outpaced supply</td>
      <td>Microsoft Corp.  is poised to post record quarterly sales underpinned by pandemic-fueled demand for videogaming and accelerated adoption of its cloud-computing services.<br />The software giant’s fiscal second-quarter earnings due Tuesday afternoon will reflect a period when demand for the latest versions of its Xbox videogame consoles has outstripped supply. Wall Street expects Microsoft to post $40.2 billion in sales, the highest for any three-month period and up around 9% from the prior-year quarter. Net income is expected to jump by $1 billion to $12.6 billion, according to FactSet.<br />The remote work era has been a boon for Microsoft. In addition to its videogaming and cloud-computing products, the company has seen strong sales for its Surface laptops as people bought devices to work remotely and enable distance learning. And use of Microsoft’s Teams workplace collaboration software that includes text chat and videoconferencing, and has been a priority for Chief Executive Satya Nadella, has jumped during the pandemic. Microsoft shares have risen more than 37% over the past year.<br />Mr. Nadella’s bet on cloud computing has been pivotal to Microsoft’s multiyear run of year-over-year sales increases. Sales for the company’s Azure cloud-services have expanded rapidly however, before the pandemic hit, the pace of growth was slowing as the business gained scale. The remote work era arrested that decline. Azure sales increased 48% in the September quarter, up from 47% expansion in the prior three-month period.<br />Azure became a bigger source of revenue for Microsoft than its Windows operating system licenses in the September quarter, said Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Piper Sandler. Microsoft doesn’t break out Azure revenue, but the company is the world’s second-largest cloud-computing vendor after  Amazon.com Inc.</td>

Mr. Wine, whose bid to unseat Mr. Museveni after nearly 35 years in power struck a chord with many young voters, called on them to peacefully march against the outcome of the Jan. 14 vote.<br />“Museveni is using the military and the police in a partisan manner to oppress his opponents and to suppress our rights,” said Mr. Wine. “We are standing for what is moral and what is just.”<br />Soldiers confined Mr. Wine and his wife at their home a day after the election, which took place amid a total internet blackout and heavy security. According to the official results, which Mr. Wine says were rigged, he won 35% of the vote, compared with 59% for Mr. Museveni. Mr. Wine’s party has until Feb. 5 to challenge the outcome in court.<br />U.S. officials have said the results were fundamentally flawed and, along with other governments, urged an investigation into the deadly violence that preceded the vote. On polling day, police arrested 30 election observers, hours after the U.S. called off its own monitoring mission when many of its observers were denied accreditation.</td>

But modest growth in consumer-health products also contributed to the sales boost in the latest quarter.<br />Alex Gorsky, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said that Johnson & Johnson would soon share data from its final-stage study of the coronavirus vaccine it is developing. Emergency approval from the Food & Drug Administration could follow, and would bolster the U.S. supply of shots aimed at ending the pandemic amid a rocky vaccine rollout.<br />If study results, expected by early next week, are positive and the vaccine receives U.S. authorization, J&J expects to provide about 100 million doses for use in the U.S. by the end of June, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said in an interview. The federal government also has options to purchase additional doses beyond that.<br />J&J tested its vaccine as a single dose. The vaccine can be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures, whereas the two vaccines authorized in the U.S. are given in two doses and must be kept at frozen temperatures, before being thawed for administration.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The world economy is gearing up for a strong recovery from the pandemic in 2021 after shrinking considerably less than initially feared last year, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, though it warned that the outlook is subject to exceptional uncertainty.<br />Global output is projected to grow 5.5% this year, up from the IMF’s October forecast of a 5.2% increase. Last year’s estimated contraction of 3.5% was smaller than October’s forecast for a 4.4% contraction. China was the only major economy to grow last year, expanding by 2.3% amid effective containment measures and forceful economic support, the IMF said.<br />The outlook has been buoyed by hopes for increasing vaccination and improved therapies to combat Covid-19, which sparked widespread economic lockdowns last year. It assumes “broad vaccine availability in advanced economies and some emerging market economies in summer 2021 and across most countries by the second half of 2022,” the IMF said. That is faster than the multilateral lender expected when it published its previous set of forecasts in October.<br />Continued government spending measures in Japan and the U.S., where Congress authorized a $900 billion package in late December, contributed to the improved forecasts. The IMF expects the U.S. economy to grow 5.1% this year and Japan’s to expand by 3.1%. However, it lowered its forecast for the euro area to 4.2% growth from 5.2%. The IMF is the global lender of last resort to countries in distress.<br />The stronger-than-expected recovery masks significant disparities between high-skilled workers and their less-educated counterparts, the IMF’s chief economist, Gita Gopinath, said in a December interview. Similarly, rich countries are faring better than poor ones as the global pandemic nears its first anniversary.</td>

So they have been looking for companionship at remote co-living spaces, where tenants rent furnished rooms in big, shared homes.<br />These former vacation homes, farms or converted hotels offer a shared office space and a place to sleep for those who want temporary accommodation.<br />European millennials have been at the forefront of this trend. Coconat—short for community and concentrated work in nature—is in a village outside Berlin. The 5-acre property, based in a converted manor, includes shared offices, a sauna, a swimming pond, a yoga studio and 20 rooms for guests who get three meals a day and pay less rent than for a Berlin apartment.<br />“Every room is taken, and it’s surprising,” said co-founder Julianne Becker. “The people really want to get out of the cities.”</td>

Taiwan is expected to report a 1.9% expansion for the year Friday, according to Fitch Solutions.<br />The Bank of Korea attributed South Korea’s relative economic durability during the pandemic to its large manufacturing industry, well-established online shopping base and strong pandemic-response measures.<br />“The recovery of global demand for our mainstream products like semiconductors in the second half of the year contributed to the economic cushioning,” said Park Yang-su, director general at the Bank of Korea’s economics statistics department.</td>

Markets have to juggle the bleakness of the present—global airline capacity is less than half what it was a year ago and the industry faces new travel restrictions—with the prospect of a vaccine-led rebound. But the recovery will also be a slog: Passenger numbers aren’t expected to return to 2019 levels until 2024.<br /></td>

Possible scenarios include a government under a new prime minister, or another coalition led by Mr. Conte.</td>

In hospital critical-care units, they were seeing more younger people and women with serious cases of Covid-19, a disease that previously inflicted its worst symptoms largely on older patients and men.<br />The shift—backed up now by statistical studies—is part of an urgent puzzle preoccupying British public-health officials as they race to understand a strain of the virus that is more transmissible and, some studies indicate, could be deadlier than earlier versions.<br />One early hypothesis, scientists say, is that one of the virus’s genetic mutations makes it better at invading a greater number of cells inside the body, leading to serious sickness in people who with previous Covid-19 variants would only have had mild or no symptoms.<br />David Strain, a physician and instructor at the University of Exeter’s medical school who is also treating Covid-19 patients, said initial research paints a picture of a virus variant that is like a burglar that has become better at breaking and entering—into vulnerable cells in this case, not houses.<br />“We think that’s why it’s making people sicker as well as being more transmissible,” Dr. Strain said.</td>

Now they’re on the ramparts looking down as armies of day traders use options to send the value of heavily-shorted stocks like  GameStop Corp.  surging.<br />Professional investors are worried: How can financial markets function when stock movements are so obviously disconnected from fundamentals, played by both sides like a videogame?<br />Those worries are understandable but overblown. Here, a little international comparison is helpful: Unlike some other major global equity markets, frenetic individual investors are far from the point where they are really disrupting the real purpose of equity markets—to help companies to raise capital.<br />Retail traders are associated with market inefficiency, because they’re considered more likely to trade on noise, accelerating surges and dips. Volatility isn’t good for companies that want a placid, reliable environment to raise capital in. That’s part of the reason special-purpose acquisition vehicles, or SPACs, boomed in popularity last year, with both investors and issuers looking to avoid a choppy stock market.<br />But there is a difference of degree internationally. Retail order flows have reached 20% of the U.S. stock market’s total, according to UBS research, twice what they were in 2010. Off-exchange trading, which includes but isn’t limited to retail, is up to a record 48% of the total, compared with 2019 levels of more like 35%. That is nothing though, relative to the over 80% that Chinese retail traders account for, according to recent research by U.S. and China-based academics.</td>

But as auto makers spend billions to build more plug-in models in the U.S., investors are increasing their bets on companies looking to expand the supply chain for batteries and related materials in North America—a region that has long relied on imports for such components.<br />Sila Nanotechnologies Inc., a Silicon Valley startup that makes silicon anode materials used in batteries, is among the latest to attract Wall Street backing. The company plans to reveal Tuesday that it has raised $590 million in new funding, Chief Executive Gene Berdichevsky told The Wall Street Journal.<br />Much of that money will be used to build a factory in the U.S. for making battery materials, he said.

      <td>UBS  Group AG’s focus on the world’s rich is helping it power through the coronavirus pandemic with some of the best financial results in global banking, but a cloud over new Chief Executive Ralph Hamers is threatening to throw Switzerland’s largest lender off course this year.<br />UBS on Tuesday ramped up a share buyback program after 2020 net profit rose 54% from gains in its banking and wealth management units. The bank said it is meeting all of its financial targets and is anticipating lower levels of bad loans from the pandemic than many rivals because of its safer lending to Swiss borrowers and the global rich.<br />The strong results were overshadowed by a criminal investigation into Mr. Hamers, who became CEO on Nov. 1 after a two-month handover period. Just over a month later, a Dutch court ordered a fresh probe into his role in a money-laundering scandal at his former employer, ING Groep NV. UBS has said it is backing Mr. Hamers in the probe, which is expected to take a year or more.<br />UBS seeks to bank the world’s rich and help them manage their wealth. It also competes with Wall Street banks in market trading and in advising companies on stock and debt deals, and mergers and acquisitions. Both areas had a bumper year as wealth clients rotated their investments and investment banking customers traded more and brought deals to take advantage of a rise in asset prices from government and central-bank stimulus.<br />The Swiss bank said its performance allowed it to set aside more capital in the fourth quarter to buy back shares and that it will purchase at least $1.1 billion worth of stock in the first quarter. It said it could buy back 4 billion Swiss francs worth of shares, equivalent to $4.5 billion, in the next three years.</td>

      <td>The apartment business has weathered the Covid-19 pandemic better than most of the real-estate sector. That is starting to change.<br />Owners of multifamily buildings are falling behind on loan payments. Banks view a greater number of rental loans as high risk, and fewer lenders are available to help struggling developers with financing. Eviction protections, lower rent collections and unprecedented declines in the asking rent in some urban markets are also taking their toll on apartment owners.<br />Niche corners of the multifamily business that were popular with investors before the pandemic are now some of the worst off. Ratings companies have downgraded bonds tied to senior-housing and student-housing properties, and some co-living companies, where tenants lease rooms in shared apartments, are also struggling. Earlier this month, the co-living operator Quarters closed all of its U.S. operations, filing for 10 bankruptcies.<br />But the traditional rental-apartment business is showing cracks, too. During the pandemic, the share of total apartment debt that banks place into their highest-risk categories has ballooned to 16.9% from 4.6%, according to a December report from Trepp LLC, a real-estate data firm that compiled risk ratings from more than a dozen major banks.<br />“A lot of this was driven by people being in stress,” said Russell Hughes, a vice president at Trepp. Landlords requested payment leniency on their loans, and this was a major factor in banks raising their risk assessments, he added.</td>

That amount is equivalent to nearly 10% of 2019 household spending, estimates Berenberg’s chief economist, Holger Schmieding.<br />“In this unusual recession, governments have been unusually generous, people have not been able to spend the money, and hence they have the money and will to spend,” Mr. Schmieding said. Once business restrictions are lifted and people feel it is safe to go out again, “there will be a lot of spending—my guess is the beaches will be crowded, the pubs will be crowded” and, “by May and June it will be in full swing,” he said.<br />President Biden is calling for a new $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package to help Americans weather the economic shock of the pandemic.

Ltd. and Gunvor Group, have lines of credit from banks that give them cheaper rates to finance reduced-carbon production of everything from oil to aluminum.  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. has a deal with European energy giant  Enel  SpA that offers incentives for the company to meet certain environmental targets by the end of 2022—and a penalty if those targets aren’t met.<br />Those discounts help produce and deliver the raw materials that power the global economy in a more sustainable way, some bankers and traders said. Green assets are already trendy on Wall Street, which sells a growing number of products aimed at improving the world and producing higher returns through so-called environmental, social and governance investing. The lending also helps banks, increasingly under pressure from shareholders and regulators, meet their own green-investing targets.<br />“There is an incredible hunger for clean assets,” said Neha Coulon, global head of ESG solutions at JPMorgan Chase. “At the end of every year, I saw ESG investing becoming more mainstream, but I wasn’t prepared for 2020 to be such a big year.”<br />The push for sustainability has prompted shifts throughout the commodities industry. Trafigura built a desk dedicated to trading low-carbon aluminum to keep up with demand for a cleaner version of the metal. Lightweight, recyclable and used in everything from electric cars to solar panels, aluminum still requires a large carbon footprint to produce, mostly because smelting processes have remained little changed for more than a century, industry experts said.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he is ready to move ahead with a power-sharing agreement after two Democratic senators said they won’t support ending the legislative filibuster, a central sticking point for the GOP in the talks.<br />In a statement released late Monday, the Kentucky Republican said his concerns about the filibuster rule, which requires 60 votes for most legislation to advance, had been assuaged by comments from Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin reaffirming their opposition to its elimination. Their statements earlier in the day signaled that Democrats don’t have the votes needed to kill the filibuster unilaterally, since that would require all 50 of them, plus Vice President Kamala Harris, to vote as a bloc.<br />President Biden, who served 36 years in the Senate, said during his presidential campaign that he would prefer to preserve the filibuster, unless GOP resistance to his legislative agenda made eliminating it necessary. Asked Friday whether Mr. Biden still opposes eliminating the filibuster, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: “The president’s position hasn’t changed.”<br />The Democratic senators “agree with President Biden’s and my view that no Senate majority should destroy the right of future minorities of both parties to help shape legislation,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement Monday night. In his statement, he pointed to a 2001 agreement—the last time there was a 50-50 Senate—as a model for 2021.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) had previously embraced that approach, which gave the parties equal seats on committees and let nominees and bills advance to the floor even if a committee vote was tied.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The House sent over the article of impeachment of former President Donald Trump to the Senate Monday evening, officially starting the countdown to a trial expected to highlight the rifts within the GOP over Mr. Trump’s legacy and his future influence over the party.<br />The House impeachment managers, who will act as the prosecutors in Mr. Trump’s second impeachment trial, walked through the Capitol to deliver the article, which alleges he incited a mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />The proceedings leading up to the trial in the Senate, where a two-thirds supermajority will be needed to convict Mr. Trump, coincide with a moment of intense internal wrestling within the Republican Party. Some GOP lawmakers have criticized Mr. Trump’s rhetoric and actions and called on the party to change direction, while loyalists to Mr. Trump have sought to keep Republicans in line behind the former president, who is popular with the party’s base.<br />“There is only one question at stake, only one question, that senators of both parties will have to answer before God and their own conscience,” said Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y) on the floor of the Senate.  “Is former President Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection against the United States?”<br />Spokespeople for Mr. Trump didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.</td>

      <td>Democrats want to punish the ex-President but may revive him.</td>
      <td>Democrats can’t let go of Donald Trump even as a former President, so on Monday House managers walked their article of impeachment to the Senate for a trial. Their goal is to banish Mr. Trump from running for office again. The result may instead be his acquittal and political revival.<br />Democrats have already forced one impeachment trial, resulting in acquittal and no notable decline in his political standing. He lost the election due to his handling of Covid and its consequences. But now Democrats want to do it once more with feeling, after Mr. Trump urged his supporters to march on the Capitol on Jan. 6 with a goal of overturning the Electoral College vote for Joe Biden.<br />We’ve said Mr. Trump’s actions—and failure to act to stop the riot as it unfolded—were an impeachable offense and urged him to resign. But now he is out of office and no longer the “imminent threat” that House Democrats said justified their rushed impeachment. The question is what good purpose a Senate trial will serve, and that isn’t apparent.<br />The Democratic case is that Mr. Trump must be punished lest any future President try something similar in his final days. A conviction by two-thirds of the Senate would also open him to a majority vote barring Mr. Trump from running for public office again. But what if he is acquitted?<br />One problem is whether such a trial is even constitutional. We’ve run op-eds arguing pro and con. The language in the Constitution refers to impeachment against a President while in office, and Mr. Trump is now a private citizen. Chief Justice John Roberts doesn’t seem to believe he needs to preside over the trial because the Constitution stipulates that role for the Chief only for a President. Senior Democrat Pat Leahy will preside instead.</td>

      <td>Even a federal bribe isn’t enough to get them back teaching in classrooms.</td>
      <td>The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) this weekend vetoed Joe Biden’s plan to reopen schools during his first 100 days by voting to continue remote learning indefinitely. The union is taking kids hostage to extract more money from Congress with no guarantee that it will release them if it does.<br />Chicago’s Board of Education had required K-8 teachers to show up at schools on Monday to prepare for a return to in-person instruction on Feb. 1. The union doesn’t care. Seventy-one percent of CTU voting members rejected a return to in-person learning until schools are “safe”—meaning whenever teachers feel like going back.<br />The district has installed air purifiers in classrooms, conducted ventilation tests, increased cleaning and procured rapid testing, among other things. It will begin vaccinating teachers next month. There’s no excuse for teachers not to return to classrooms.<br />“Students in over 130 private and parochial schools and over 2,000 early learning centers across the city have been safely learning in their classrooms since the fall, and we must provide that same option to our families who, through no fault of their own, have been unable to make remote learning work for their children,” Chicago Public Schools said. “We’ve seen grades, attendance, and enrollment drop significantly for many of our students in recent months, and the impact has been felt most by our Black and Latinx students.”<br />After the union vote, the district postponed teachers’ start-date until Wednesday to provide time “to resolve our discussions without risking disruption to student learning.” Haven’t district leaders read the children’s book “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie”? Accommodating unreasonable demands leads to more unreasonable demands.</td>

      <td>China’s President sweet-talks liberal leaders as he threatens Taiwan.</td>
      <td>Chinese President Xi Jinping knows his audience. In his Monday address to the World Economic Forum, the annual meeting of global luminaries in Davos, Mr. Xi sounded like a liberal internationalist in good standing. He pulled out all the buzzwords that make Davosians swoon: “inclusive growth,” “green development,” “global governance” and “consensus building.”<br />The Davos website effused that this was a “historic opportunity for collaboration.” But Mr. Xi’s People’s Liberation Army told a different story over the weekend, menacing Taiwan with back-to-back military flyovers of more than a dozen planes. The provocation is a reminder that while the government has changed hands in Washington, it hasn’t in Beijing, which still sees extending sovereignty over Taiwan—possibly by force—as a priority.<br />Mr. Xi said in his speech that “the strong should not bully the weak,” but that admonition doesn’t seem to apply to his own government. “We should stay committed to international law and international rules, instead of seeking one’s own supremacy,” he added. Tell that to the people of Hong Kong who were promised autonomy through 2047 in a treaty Beijing signed with Britain but are now being arrested for even mild political dissent.<br />Judging from comments by Secretary of State nominee Tony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in their Senate hearings, the new Administration seems to recognize the importance of Taiwan’s independence and U.S. predominance in the Western Pacific.<br />Yet many in the Administration are also true believers in the types of global-governance values Mr. Xi claimed to endorse in his Davos speech, which they see as the best way to solve problems like climate change. Unlike Mr. Xi, they aren’t experienced in using those values as a shield to relentlessly push their own national interest.</td>

      <td>Video platform Vimeo Inc. has completed a $300 million fundraising round that values the company at $5 billion, an 82% boost from a raise three months ago.<br />The round was led by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. and financial-services firm Oberndorf Enterprises LLC. The new capital will be used to fuel its growth, innovation and talent, Vimeo parent  IAC/InterActiveCorp  said Monday.<br />In November, Vimeo raised $150 million from technology-investment firm Thrive Capital and Singapore’s sovereign-wealth fund GIC Private Ltd. That investment valued the business at $2.75 billion.<br />Last month, IAC, an internet holding company, said it planned to spin off the online-video platform, in a deal expected to close in the second quarter. IAC shareholders will receive a proportionate amount of Vimeo stock, the company said.<br />Vimeo has seen a surge of revenue as businesses rely more on the internet to reach customers during the coronavirus pandemic. December marked its highest month of revenue growth, increasing 57% year over year, IAC said.</td>

The man was beaten and cut with an unknown object, and suffered slashes to his head, torso and hand, the officials said. The suspects then took the man’s clothes and cell phone before fleeing in private vehicles, the officials said.<br />The victim, who is from Brooklyn, was transported to Manhattan’s Bellevue Hospital, where he was in stable condition.<br />A NYPD spokeswoman said Monday that investigators were still working to determine the motive of the suspects. The NYPD circulated a video of the incident over the weekend in an effort to identify the suspects.</td>
