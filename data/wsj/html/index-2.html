      <td>WASHINGTON—Former Sen. Bob Dole, the longtime Republican Senate leader who was the party’s nominee for president in 1996, said he has been diagnosed with stage four lung cancer and will begin treatment next week.<br />“While I certainly have some hurdles ahead, I know that I join millions of Americans who face significant health challenges of their own,” said Mr. Dole, 97 years old, in a tweet Thursday morning. He said he would start treatment Monday.<br />Mr. Dole fought in World War II and lost most use of his right arm and hand after being wounded in battle. He entered politics after returning home, winning a seat in the Kansas Legislature before successfully running for the U.S. House and then Senate. In 1976, Mr. Dole was picked as then-President Gerald Ford’s running mate in his unsuccessful re-election bid. After serving as the top Republican in the Senate, Mr. Dole won the GOP presidential nomination in 1996, but lost to Democrat Bill Clinton.<br />As a lawmaker for decades, Mr. Dole played a role on legislation ranging from Social Security to the rights of the disabled. He was instrumental in both the Reagan-era tax cuts as well as the overhaul of the nation’s tax code in 1986.<br />In recent years, Mr. Dole has become best known for championing causes tied to his generation. He was a driving force behind creation of the World War II Memorial on the National Mall, and then adopted the cause of “Freedom Flights,” which bring World War II veterans to visit the memorial built in their honor.</td>

Over 400,000 customers in Texas still had no power and millions of residents were under a boil-water notice on Thursday as another winter storm pounded covered much of the U.S. with snow, freezing rain and extreme cold.<br />H-E-B LP, a Texas supermarket chain, said it has shortened store hours and cut back on nonessential power usage, such as for lighting. The company placed purchase limits on some items, including water and propane tanks. Aldi Inc., another grocery chain, said Thursday that it reopened a Texas distribution center closed earlier in the week as snow and frigid temperatures descended across the southern U.S.<br />Many restaurants in the region had stocked up for Valentine’s Day and Fat Tuesday, only to see reservations vanish as temperatures plummeted. Reservations at Texas restaurants this week were at the lowest levels since last May, according to online booking site OpenTable.<br />Jack Gilmore said he closed the six Austin restaurants he co-owns on Saturday night due to the coming storm. He said that Valentine’s Day is typically his third-busiest night of the year; his Jack Allen’s Kitchen and Salt Traders Coastal Cooking restaurants were stocked with enough food for days of strong sales. He said some employees have asked if they can take milk home from restaurant coolers because they can’t find it at grocery stores.</td>

Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) said in a call with reporters Thursday.<br />White House officials have used similar language with immigration advocates, saying they were embracing the approach of “multiple trains leaving the station,” according to two people familiar with their thinking.<br />Mr. Menendez said he has already spoken to Republicans who might not be on board with the entire proposal but have said they are interested in various elements.</td>

      <td>PARIS—A child sex-abuse scandal at the heart of the French establishment has triggered a bout of national soul-searching over cultural attitudes and a legal system that victims say leave minors vulnerable to sexual predators.<br />In a memoir published last month, Camille Kouchner, a member of one of France’s most prominent political and intellectual families, accused her stepfather, the legal scholar and public intellectual Olivier Duhamel, of sexually abusing her twin brother from when he was around 14 years old.<br />Those accusations have prompted a criminal investigation of Mr. Duhamel, a former member of the European Parliament, and sparked an outpouring of testimony from others who say they, too, suffered childhood sexual assaults by different abusers.<br />President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to tighten France’s laws against sex with children. The National Assembly on Thursday approved a bill that would automatically define sex between an adult and a child younger than 15 years old as rape. The threshold would be 18 years old in cases of incest. That removes the burden on child victims under current French law to prove the sex wasn’t consensual—a step other countries took decades ago.<br />Mr. Duhamel resigned in January as president of the foundation overseeing Sciences Po, one of France’s elite universities. His radio show was canceled, and he has disappeared from public view. A lawyer for Mr. Duhamel declined to comment.</td>

      <td>Quarterly results and a lock-up expiration hit shares of the richly valued software maker, but it is finding support in online forums</td>
      <td>Even a powerful crystal ball couldn’t have foreseen this.<br />On Thursday, as the  GameStop  saga moved officially into the halls of Congress, the crowd that has been favoring the videogame retailer turned its eye to  Palantir Technologies —a Denver-based software company named for such a magical element in the “Lord of the Rings” saga. Palantir spent the day as a top trending stock on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum—coming in second only to GameStop—according to TopStonks.com.<br />The two have little in common. Until relatively recently, GameStop was one of the most beaten-down stocks on Wall Street, due to widespread belief that its days were numbered. Palantir by contrast has been the hottest in a batch of popular software companies that went public last year. By the end of last week, Palantir’s share price was up 340% from the reference price on its direct listing on Sept. 30 and 236% above the closing price of its first trading day, showing that most of its gains didn’t come from the infamous first-day pop.  Snowflake  and  C3.ai —both of whose share prices more than doubled on their first trading day—have picked up an additional 18% and 66%, respectively, from their first-day close.<br />Then came Palantir’s fourth-quarter results Monday morning, which investors found disappointing mostly due to a forecast implying a significant deceleration in revenue growth later this year. That took nearly 13% off the stock that day. Another big drop came Thursday, as more than 383 million of the company’s shares were freed from a post-IPO lockup provision. By midday, trading volume on Palantir was more than triple the stock’s daily average since the start of the year, according to FactSet data.<br />The selloff seems to have signaled a buying opportunity to online punters. Unlike GameStop, Palantir hasn’t been a big target of short sellers. But it does bring a whiff of controversy due to its national-security work, which in turn has led the company to depict itself as a Silicon Valley outcast. It also brings a loose association with Elon Musk—patron saint of the Reddit crowd—given that Palantir was co-founded by his former business partner Peter Thiel.</td>

      <td>The Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent move to install an outside monitor to oversee private-equity firm GPB Capital Holdings LLC has prompted some of the firm’s investors and their lawyers to ask what took so long.<br />GPB Capital’s regulatory filings show that the SEC began probing the New York firm as early as 2018. In September of that year, Massachusetts securities regulators started an investigation of GPB’s sales of funds to Main Street investors, noting that the firm had failed to file required financial statements.<br />Earlier this month, the Justice Department charged three men, including GPB’s then-chief executive, with fraud in connection with what New York Attorney General Letitia James described as a $1.7 billion Ponzi-like scheme.<br />A few days later, the SEC requested an emergency court action that would impose a monitor, citing the need to protect thousands of investors with money at risk in four GPB private-equity funds. In a Feb. 8 court filing, the agency said it began trying to place a monitor inside GPB in the summer of 2020, but it was unable to reach an agreement with the firm, prompting it to seek the court’s intervention.<br />“GPB Capital could have been stopped years ago on regulatory and compliance grounds,” said Jay Frederick, an investor and investment adviser in Little Rock, Ark., in an email. He said he raised concerns about GPB, in which he and some of his clients have invested, in a letter to the SEC in November 2019. He said the agency’s response was “lacking, at best.”</td>

      <td>In Spain, the nourishing and protein-packed stew cocido is a ritual that plays out over three courses. Even better, the leftovers provide more meals throughout the week.</td>
      <td>THE FIRST four times I called, I got a busy signal. Then, finally, an answer: “Best I can do is two people, three months from now, ¿Vale?” I was trying to clinch one of the toughest reservations in Madrid, and it wasn’t at some celebrity-chef spot but, rather, at Malacatín, a neighborhood tavern famous for one thing: cocido. “Book it,” I said, without a moment’s hesitation.<br />Cocido, Spain’s quintessential boiled dinner, includes buttery chickpeas, fall-apart beef and chicken, vegetables smoky with pimentón (Spanish paprika), and a broth so rich it gives cassoulet a run for its money. For centuries, the dish has been the backbone of Spanish cold-weather cooking, but because of its medieval optics and laundry list of ingredients, it never quite caught on abroad like tapas or paella. Most people outside Spain have never heard of it much less made it at home, even if products like Serrano ham and morcilla (blood sausage) are increasingly easy to track down.<br />Cocidos range from Catalonia’s meatball-laden escudella to Canarian puchero bobbing with corn on the cob, but the most famous version hails from Madrid. Spaniards love cocido madrileño for its ritualistic three vuelcos, or courses—first the broth, then the chickpeas and vegetables, then the meats. These can include beef shank, chicken, jamón, chorizo, ham hocks, bacon, trotters, pig ears, lardo, pancetta, blood sausage and marrow bones. The magic lies in mixing and matching proteins to hit the sweet spot between fatty and lean, smoky and sweet.<br />“Cocido is liturgy in Madrid. It connects us to our childhood and to our grandmothers,” said José Alberto Rodríguez, the fourth-generation owner of Malacatín, as he led me to an elbow-worn table set with a bowl, a soup spoon and a cloth bib. “For those of us who grew up here, the smell of cocido is the smell of home.” (That smell carried on through the week back at my house, as leftovers found their way into soups, bechamel croquettes and ropa vieja, a saucy chickpea stew enlivened with spoonfuls of pimentón.)<br />In “Madrid: A Culinary History,” María Paz Moreno writes that cocido’s origins can be traced to Sephardic adafina, “a filling stew of chickpeas, root vegetables, and lamb meat traditionally cooked in a large clay pot overnight on Friday and eaten on the Sabbath.” But if cocido has Jewish roots, what’s with all the piggy bits found in it today? Ms. Moreno explains that during the Spanish Inquisition, Catholic authorities kept a watchful eye on Conversos (converted Jews) to make sure they were acting like proper Christians. Fearing persecution, these converts are thought to have overcompensated with their use of non-kosher meats. Adafina was also a likely ancestor of French pot-au-feu and Italian bollito misto.</td>

      <td>World Wrestling Entertainment’s CFO outlines how the pandemic has altered the company’s live-event business model</td>
      <td>For decades,  World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.  has had a simple formula for making money: traveling to cities across the country and televising acrobatic wrestling matches between spandex-clad athletes. Merchandise sales provided additional revenue, as did the streaming of matches in recent years on the WWE Network.<br />The pandemic dented that model. Virus-related restrictions put WWE’s stadium shows on hold, resulting in an estimated $90 million in lost revenue in 2020. In the face of that setback, the company has found a new way to stage its performances and is accelerating its efforts to find new audiences. It’s producing shows for its TV and streaming audiences at a temporary production facility in Florida. And in January it signed an exclusive streaming deal with NBCUniversal Media LLC’s Peacock streaming service, expanding its reach, especially among younger consumers. It also created a new show aimed at attracting viewers in India.<br />Kristina Salen, WWE’s chief financial officer, joined the wrestling company last summer, following stints in the startup world and as the former CFO of Etsy Inc.<br />She has overseen investments aimed at re-creating the look and feel of a stadium show at the company’s Florida production facility, including lasers, pyrotechnics, and video displays in the arena’s seating area that sometimes show fans or characters in the narrative of the performance. “WrestleMania,” WWE’s first live event in more than a year, and the only one scheduled so far in 2021, is set to take place on April 10 and 11.<br />But attracting and maintaining consumers’ attention could be a challenge. Average viewership of two of the company’s prime-time programs, “Raw” on the USA Network and “SmackDown” on Fox, fell sharply in the early months of the pandemic, though viewership began to stabilize later in 2020. WWE Network had 1.5 million paid subscribers to its streaming service as of Dec. 31, up 6% from a year earlier but down from the early months of the pandemic.</td>

      <td>Walmart  Inc.’s  pledge to lift its average hourly pay above $15 comes in the middle of a Washington debate on whether to more than double the federal minimum wage.<br />The big-box retailer’s goal is politically significant because it aligns with President Biden’s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from the $7.25 an hour that has been in place for 11 years. It also comes from the nation’s largest private employer, with stores located in different labor markets across the country.<br />But Walmart’s announcement Thursday isn’t an endorsement of Mr. Biden’s plan, which is part of a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief proposal by Democrats in Congress expected to pass the House later this month. The company supports a higher federal minimum wage, but not $15 an hour. While it plans to raise pay for 425,000 hourly workers from an average above $14 in January 2020, its minimum starting wage would remain at $11 an hour.<br />Still, the company’s move could play into both sides of the federal minimum-wage debate.<br />Democrats who support Mr. Biden’s wage plan can argue Walmart’s pay raises are proof employers can afford wage increases despite the pandemic’s economic disruptions, economists and analysts say. Republicans who oppose doubling the federal pay floor will likely see it as an example of effective free-market forces, arguing the government doesn’t need to intervene.</td>

While Democrats want to spend $1.9 trillion, most Republicans argued for much less. A group of 10 Republican senators made a counteroffer of $618 billion but President Biden wasn’t interested. The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, of which Janet Yellen was a director until her recent elevation to secretary of the Treasury, points out convincingly that the actual output gap that needs to be closed in 2021 amounts to only $380 billion. Therefore, all the spending proposals on the table amount to vast overkill.</td>

      <td>CHICAGO—Former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan resigned his legislative seat representing a Chicago ward Thursday, amid a continuing federal probe into a kickback and bribery scheme allegedly aimed at influencing him.<br />The 78-year-old protégé of former Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley had been the longest-serving state house speaker in U.S. history.<br />“It’s no secret that I have been the target of vicious attacks by people who sought to diminish my many achievements lifting up the working people of Illinois,” he said. “The fact is, my motivation for holding elected office has never wavered. I have been resolute in my dedication to public service and integrity, always acting in the interest of the people of Illinois.”<br />Just over a month ago, Mr. Madigan stepped aside in his bid to be re-elected speaker after failing to gather enough votes in his caucus to guarantee victory. Instead, state Rep. Emanuel “Chris” Welch, a Madigan ally from the Chicago suburbs, became the first Black House speaker in the history of the state. Mr. Madigan had served as House Speaker for all but two years since 1983.<br />Last July, Mr. Madigan was referred to as Public Official A in a federal deferred prosecution agreement with Commonwealth Edison. The  Exelon Corp.  subsidiary agreed to pay a $200 million fine to resolve charges that it had handed out jobs and internships to Mr. Madigan’s associates in a bid to win support from Mr. Madigan for its legislative agenda.</td>

      <td>Frozen oil and gas wells and pipeline infrastructure have reduced the fuel available to power plants</td>
      <td>A giant shortage of natural gas is hindering a recovery from the devastating cold spell that left millions without power in the nation’s midsection.<br />Natural gas production across the U.S. has fallen about 20% over the last week, a rapid decline driven by frozen oil and gas wells and pipeline infrastructure in Texas and other states. In Texas, which produces about a quarter of the country’s gas, production has fallen more than 30% and some of the largest power-plant operators say they have had difficulty getting enough gas.<br />Texas is starting to thaw out from its worst winter storm in a generation, and the state’s main grid operator said it has restored power to the majority of homes. Just under 500,000 electricity customers throughout the state were without power as of Thursday morning, which is down sharply from four million earlier this week, according to PowerOutage.US data.  CenterPoint Energy Inc.,  the company furnishing power to most of the Houston area, said it had restored power to all but around 31,000 customers by Thursday morning, down from more than one million customers earlier in the week.<br />But analysts say the natural gas shortfall could linger for weeks as producers and pipeline operators scramble to restart operations. Luke Jackson, an analyst at S&P Global Platts, said the supply shortfall may be larger than estimated, due to lack of publicly available data from intrastate pipelines in Texas, which don’t report gas volumes.<br />U.S. natural gas production fell from roughly 92 billion cubic feet a day to around 72 billion over the last week, according to S&P Global Platts data. During the same period national gas demand soared, at its peak, to about 152 billion cubic feet a day as a swath of the country turned up the heat in their homes.</td>

But working with the available evidence, they are gaining a stronger understanding of which animals could have plausibly been vectors.</td>

      <td>Walmart’s future revenue growth could be limited, but the retailer has ways to juice its bottom line</td>
      <td>Walmart  may have given the wrong impression with all that talk about TikTok. At the end of the day, it is a slow-growing, mature retailer—and that is perfectly fine.<br />The retailer had a standout holiday quarter. Net sales grew 7.4% in the quarter ended Jan. 31 compared with a year earlier. U.S. comparable sales grew 8.6%, far exceeding the 5.3% growth that analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected. E-commerce sales grew 69% in the quarter. Yet Walmart shares dropped almost 6% Thursday morning after results were announced.<br />Two things may have weighed on investors. The company incurred a net loss of $2.1 billion and gave relatively muted guidance, saying that U.S. comparable sales would rise by a low-single-digit percentage this fiscal year compared with the 8.6% increase it saw for the last full fiscal year.<br />Neither is particularly worrisome. The loss is largely a result of charges related to previously announced sales of foreign operations. As for the guidance numbers, growth was bound to slow some after a bumper year. Before the pandemic, Walmart’s U.S. comparable sales had been growing in the low-single-digit percentage range, if not declining, for the last decade. That has also been the case for other mature retailers such as Target and Kroger.<br />This means the real potential for a company like Walmart comes from how much more profit it can juice from a slow-growing revenue base. And things look pretty promising on that front. Fueled by Walmart’s e-commerce growth, advertising revenue nearly doubled last year and Walmart said Thursday that it should be a multibillion-dollar business in the near future.  Morgan Stanley  estimates that it could generate $4 billion of revenue and $2 billion of operating income by 2025. That would translate to roughly 9% of last fiscal year’s operating income.</td>

      <td>When Ashley Buchanan was tapped as chief executive of  Michaels  Cos., he knew he was taking over a slumping company. Sales were limping along, hurt by messy stores, a sluggish supply chain and competition from both big-box and online retailers.<br />As he officially took the reins last April, though, the arts-and-crafts chain was facing an even larger challenge: Covid-19. Most of the company’s 1,200 U.S. and Canadian locations closed to in-store shoppers amid pandemic lockdowns. Sales plummeted 27.6% in the quarter ended last May 2.<br />Then stores reopened, and homebound shoppers crafted. Americans painted, made masks, knitted and looked for ways to entertain children without screens. Michaels’s sales soared 12% in the quarter ended last Aug. 1, and 16.3% in the quarter ended Oct. 31, which included an early holiday sales rush and 128% e-commerce sales growth.<br />Mr. Buchanan, who previously spent over a decade in executive roles at Walmart Inc., aims to use the Covid-19 sales bump to remake Michaels. He hopes to attract more shoppers by moving away from the general crafts market and targeting “makers”—people who gravitate to do-it-yourself projects or make items to sell through their own small businesses.<br />To start, Mr. Buchanan has focused on retail basics like keeping shelves stocked and speeding and simplifying the supply chain, as well as adjusting to Covid-19 shopping patterns by ramping up online pickup-and-delivery options. The company is also testing an online marketplace that would let arts-and-craft enthusiasts share ideas, watch instructional videos and sell their wares. Michaels hopes it will launch later this year, says Mr. Buchanan.</td>

      <td>The Covid-19 crisis has produced some surprising winners among the ranks of global food companies, including  Kraft Heinz .<br />Nestlé ’s  performance has been less spectacular by comparison but may prove more sustainable.<br />On Thursday, the world’s biggest food business said sales at constant exchange rates increased by 3.6% last year compared with 2019. That is shy of the 4% to 6% range that Chief Executive Mark Schneider was aiming for this year. Last week, Kraft Heinz said its sales over the same period increased by an impressive 6.5%. Shoppers have gone back to legacy brands that had fallen out of fashion with health-conscious consumers in recent years.<br />The pandemic has been more of a mixed bag at Nestlé. Roughly one-sixth of its revenue comes from products like candy bars that tend to be consumed outside the home. Demand in this part of the business plummeted 30%. Trends were more positive in its pet-care division, where sales increased by more than 10%. Coffee brands also proved resilient.<br />Fears that the economic slump would cause consumers to trade down to cheaper alternatives haven't materialized so far. The share of Nestlé’s sales generated by premium products like Nespresso coffee and Purina pet food increased to 30% of the group total in 2020, up from 26% a year earlier. Strong demand for these more expensive goods is offsetting weaker sales of mainstream brands.</td>

Owners have been able to charge as much as three times market rates when selling or renting to businesses involved in the cultivation, distribution, processing or sale of cannabis, according to brokers, landlords and cannabis industry executives.<br />Landlords can charge this pot premium because properties typically have to meet a range of local restrictions to qualify, such as being a certain distance from churches or schools.<br />The owner of one sought-after Arizona retail location could have sold it for “a couple hundred thousand dollars” before the state’s recreational ballot measure was approved in November, said Steve White, chief executive of Harvest Health & Recreation Inc., a multistate cannabis business that is involved in recreational- and medical-marijuana sales in Arizona.</td>

      <td>Last year validated Jes Staley’s decision to keep the lender’s investing banking business, but he still must show that the bank can generate decent overall returns</td>
      <td>Last year’s results vindicated  Barclays ’ diversified banking strategy, but overall returns are still disappointing and the stock price remains stubbornly low.<br />The UK-headquartered bank on Thursday posted a £3 billion profit before tax for 2020, equivalent to, $4.16 billion, with strong capital markets returns offsetting contraction in its retail and credit card businesses. After years of activist pressure, Chief Executive Officer Jes Staleyclaimed victory for his strategy of a combined retail and investment bank. Barclays gained share and booked bumper profits in capital markets, offsetting poor results in its credit card and retail businesses. But overall return on tangible equity was still a disappointing 3.2%, well below its 10% long-term target. Shares fell about 4%, trading near 0.45 times book value.<br />Granted, last year was particularly nasty. Often during a downturn, customers and small businesses run up their debts slightly as they weather the storm, giving banks higher revenues but also higher loan loss provisions. This time fear pushed consumers and small businesses to pay down their debts and save cash even as provisions for loan losses jumped. But the investment banking upside was also pretty extraordinary. Given the massive liquidity and volatility in the capital markets, it could be argued that the trading profits should have been big enough to generate decent overall returns.<br />At many U.S. banks, they indeed were. In 2020,  JPMorgan Chase  posted a 14% return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity and Citi made 6.9%.<br />Management counts 2020 as a decent result under the extreme circumstances. The strategy is sound and the bank has the right footprint, says Mr. Staley, it just needs to execute as the economy reopens after vaccines rollout. It is possible. Barclays’ U.K. and U.S. credit businesses used to provide double-digit returns, and a bounceback in consumer spending could bring back those levels. The lender will also need to hold on to some of the market share gains made in the group’s trading business.</td>

      <td>Long before probes discovered the truth about Mars, stories about its inhabitants helped us understand the best and worst of humanity.</td>
      <td>This afternoon, NASA’s Perseverance rover will attempt to land on Mars, making it just the fifth vehicle on a planet about half the diameter of Earth. But compared with the eons of total emptiness until 1997, when NASA landed its first Mars rover, Sojourner, the neighborhood is getting pretty crowded. In fact, Perseverance is the third spacecraft to reach Mars just this month. On Feb. 9, the UAE’s Hope Probe arrived in orbit around Mars, where China’s Tianwen-1 joined it the very next day. In May or June, Tianwen will attempt to land its own rover on the Martian surface, making China the second country to achieve that feat.<br />The purpose of these missions is to study the composition of Mars’s soil and atmosphere. The one thing they’re certain not to find is what humanity long dreamed of finding on the red planet: an intelligent species with a civilization and technology comparable to our own. For almost a century, from the 1880s to the 1960s, Martians were humanity’s favorite shorthand for extraterrestrial life. Science fiction as a literary genre grew up with Martians, starting with H.G. Wells’s 1898 novel “The War of the Worlds,” about invaders from the red planet. So did the movies, which have used Mars as a showcase for special effects since Thomas Edison’s 1910 film “A Trip to Mars.” Martians were so popular in the early 20th century that the word itself now has a nostalgic feel, conjuring the past’s dream of a future that never came to be.<br />That humanity would fixate on Martians rather than Venusians or Saturnites wasn’t inevitable. Before the rise of modern astronomy, writers who imagined journeys to outer space generally picked the moon as a destination—naturally enough, since it’s far more conspicuous than Mars to the naked eye. The earliest such tale is the 2nd-century Greek work “A True Story,” in which the narrator’s ship is caught in a whirlwind and carried through the air for seven days and nights until it lands on the moon.<br />The shift to Mars as the most popular setting for space fantasy began in 1877, when the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli published a map of the planet that included features he called canali or “channels.” Schiaparelli didn’t believe these were artificial or carried water, but when canali was translated into English as “canals,” it was easy for readers to assume that they must be large-scale engineering projects—which meant that there must be Martians capable of building them.<br />No one did more to popularize this idea than the American astronomer Percival Lowell, who claimed to have observed even more detailed canal networks. In his 1906 book “Mars and Its Canals,” he argued that they were built by the inhabitants of Mars to transport water from the polar ice caps. The fact that the canals spanned the whole globe proved that Martians weren’t divided into warring nations, like us, but knew how to cooperate for the common good: “Whether increasing common sense or increasing necessity was the spur that drove the Martians to this eminently sagacious state we cannot say, but it is certain that reached it they have,” Lowell wrote.</td>

Energy shortages forced meat-processing plants to temporarily close, while ice buildups kept grain barges off rivers and cattle ranchers struggled to save calves born onto frozen ground in the middle of the night.<br />The processing and transport disruptions, as well as the loss of animal life, are projected to cost agriculture companies and farmers millions of dollars. Farmers and state agriculture officials said it remained too early to tally all the costs.<br />“Mother Nature is a really tough business partner, and she has been pretty unforgiving here the past few days,” said Blayne Arthur, Oklahoma’s state agriculture commissioner.<br />The storm and its aftermath strained electrical grids, forcing rolling blackouts and the direction of natural gas supplies to residential homes. Natural gas constraints led Cargill Inc., one of the biggest U.S. beef processors, to shut down three Texas meat plants through Thursday, a spokesman said, and transportation difficulties slowed its grain and animal feed businesses elsewhere.</td>

U.S. e-commerce sales, which include online grocery orders, increased 69% from a year earlier.<br />The country’s largest private employer said it would raise pay for U.S. workers to an average above $15 an hour.

That targets roles that have been especially important during the pandemic, including workers that gather products from store shelves for online orders picked up in parking lots or delivered to homes. Walmart has worked to keep shelves stocked as shoppers stockpile certain items such as food and cleaning supplies.<br />“We saw major changes to customer behavior last year we believe will be lasting, and we have to continue working to stay in-stock, deliver items on time and provide the best omni experience possible,” said Mr. Furner.</td>

      <td>Despite all the turbulence,  Airbus  stock may be flying a little too low.<br />On Thursday, the European plane maker’s shares dropped about 3% after Airbus announced that it expected to deliver at least 566 commercial aircraft this year—matching 2020 levels. This means that free cash flow for the year would roughly break even. Analysts had loftier expectations, and had penciled in a rise in deliveries that would generate positive cash flow of €500 billion, equivalent to $602 billion, in 2021, but extra travel restrictions this quarter are clouding the outlook.<br />It is a blow for investors, who are trained to look forward. Yet positive past performance shouldn’t be disregarded either, and Airbus’ results during the worst year in aviation history are encouraging.<br />For the year as a whole, the company lost €1.1 billion, which is actually less than in 2019, when losses amounted to €1.4 billion due to a €3.6 billion bribery-settlement fine. Crucially, Airbus turned a €1.6 billion profit in the fourth quarter, which is almost 60% above the median forecast compiled by FactSet.<br />Delivering 566 jets may not seem like a lot—that number was 863 in 2019—but it is close to heroic during a crisis that has grounded a third of the global airline fleet. Under such circumstances, there is little that carriers want to do less than spend cash to buy more planes.</td>

Retailers and manufacturers, meanwhile, have rushed to rebuild inventories.<br />The shortage of 40-foot steel shipping containers has snarled global supply chains for commodities, hiking prices for some raw materials. That is of interest to investors and economists, who have been on the watch for signs of inflation after governments and central banks flooded markets with cash to bolster the pandemic-hit global economy. So far, there hasn’t been a big increase in consumer prices.<br />Trading houses, though, are feeling the pinch. Firms such as U.K.-based metals merchant RJH Trading Ltd. are paying lofty rates to secure berths on vessels. They face delays before loading cargoes at ports in Asia, where the dearth of boxes is most acute.<br />Normally, it takes RJH between 30 and 40 days to get tin and antimony, a silvery metal used in the electronics industry, from Asia to Europe, said managing director Charles Swindon. In recent months, RJH has waited for several weeks to find containers at ports in China, lengthening the journey time to 70 days. Freight costs are three to four times higher, he said.</td>

Firms will also need to take steps to ensure their activities don’t have a negative impact on the environment, she said.<br />Ms. Brainard’s speech Thursday comes as the central bank has started moving forward more aggressively with efforts to shore up the financial system amid clear evidence disruptive environmental events are starting to take a toll. Ms. Brainard’s speech reaffirmed that the Fed largely sees its climate change role as part of its oversight of financial firms.</td>

      <td>Australians were caught off guard by Facebook’s decision to remove news in a deepening spat with the government over payment for content</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—Marcey Papandrea spent more than 10 years cultivating a small following on  Facebook  to draw people toward her website—called the Super Network—where she posts movie reviews and podcasts. On Thursday morning, she woke at home in Melbourne to find her Facebook page blocked.<br />Ms. Papandrea had become collateral damage in a dispute between Facebook Inc. and the Australian government over payment for content. Facebook overnight had followed through on a threat to bar users in Australia from posting news. The move also cut off access to information such as the national weather service and some local health sites, though Facebook said that had been done inadvertently.<br />“I have no idea what Facebook’s algorithm would be that someone like me would be targeted,” said Ms. Papandrea, 36 years old, who blamed both Facebook and the government for the outcome. “At the end of the day, this is like a mudslinging contest.”<br />Facebook opposes legislation by the Australian government that would effectively require big tech companies to pay the country’s media outlets for content. The legislation, which is being watched globally and could offer a model for other governments to follow, is working its way through the country’s parliament.<br />To Australian users, the Facebook pages belonging to media outlets in Australia and overseas—including The Wall Street Journal—appeared blank on Thursday with a message saying, “No posts yet.” Users who tried to post a link to a news article got a notification saying the post couldn’t be shared. Some people tried to find workarounds, such as posting screenshots of articles. Links could still be shared on Facebook’s instant-messaging platform.</td>

      <td>Consumption at major retailers and restaurants over the seven-day holiday hit $127 billion</td>
      <td>BEIJING—Chinese consumers opened up their wallets over the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, energizing a domestic retail and service sector that has proved a stubborn laggard in China’s economic recovery.<br />Consumption at major retailers and restaurants over the seven-day holiday, from Feb. 11 to Feb. 17, hit 821 billion yuan, China’s Commerce Ministry said Wednesday. That figure, equivalent to about $127 billion, represented a 29% jump from last year’s pandemic-disrupted holiday, and a 4.9% increase from the same period in 2019, long before the coronavirus swept across China.<br />The rise in spending came as tens of millions of Chinese residents heeded authorities’ call to stay put during the Lunar New Year holiday because of the coronavirus, denting what is traditionally the busiest travel season of the year. Instead, they redirected their disposable income to gifts, food, entertainment and other sectors that suffered during the height of the pandemic last year.<br />Monthly retail sales, a key gauge of consumption, only returned to year-over-year growth in August last year, becoming the last economic pillar to reclaim its pre-virus levels. But for 2020 as a whole, retail sales were still lower than 2019’s level. Beijing’s stimulus attempts during other public holidays last year failed to meaningfully boost consumption, in part because the efforts were too piecemeal, economists said.<br />This time around, authorities in various Chinese cities offered cash handouts and other incentives to remain in place after a resurgence of coronavirus cases began sweeping across northern China last month.</td>

      <td>Borrowed from the literary and film series and popularized by Thai protesters in 2014, the gesture has become a prominent symbol against this month’s coup in Myanmar</td>
      <td>SINGAPORE—As protests against a Feb. 1 military coup have gripped Myanmar, one symbol has emerged as an icon: the three-finger salute. Civil servants on strike, student protesters, even refugees living abroad have made the gesture in a show of defiance.<br />The sign has an unlikely origin story, popularized in the wake of a different coup, in 2014, in neighboring Thailand. Protesters there borrowed it from the literary and film series “The Hunger Games,” in which it is shown as a symbol for a fictional uprising against tyrannical overlords. Images of political activist Rittipong Mahapetch—flashing the sign at a busy Bangkok intersection against the backdrop of a pedestrian overpass crowded with soldiers—went viral just over a week after the Thai coup.<br />The spread of the salute shows how the region’s youth-led movements against authoritarianism, seeing their own struggles reflected abroad, have looked to one another for strategies, support and momentum as they face powerful opponents. Hong Kong’s decentralized protests against Chinese control became a model for recent Thai democracy demonstrators, who have for months challenged their country’s military-backed establishment. The hashtag #MilkTeaAlliance emerged as an online campaign through which Asian activists from Taiwan to Myanmar show solidarity with each other.<br />The governments they stand against are learning from each other, too, analysts and historians say.<br />“Activists are watching each other and trying to get ideas from each other, but at the same time authoritarian states are watching one another and trying to borrow their tricks,” said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a professor of history at University of California, Irvine and author of the book “Vigil: Hong Kong on the Brink.”</td>

      <td>WHO-backed facility is world’s main effort to get shots to developing nations</td>
      <td>Developing countries are falling dangerously behind in the global race to end the coronavirus pandemic through vaccinations. The Covax facility aims to get Covid-19 shots to at least 20% of the populations of the world’s poorest nations.<br />Covax is the world’s main effort for getting Covid-19 vaccines to poor countries. It was started last year by the World Health Organization and two groups that have been working on getting vaccines to developing countries—Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations—when it became clear that many nations would struggle to access the shots. As rich countries have done, Covax made deals with vaccine manufacturers to buy doses before they had passed clinical trials and been approved by drug regulators. The money to buy the vaccines has been donated mostly by Western governments and charitable groups, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.<br />Covax aims to provide free Covid-19 vaccines to at least 20% of the populations of the world’s 92 poorest countries by the end of 2021. Just over 50 other nations, including Canada and upper-middle income nations such as South Africa and Mexico, have also ordered vaccines through Covax, but have to pay for the doses themselves.<br />Covax has made deals with most of the big manufacturers, including  Pfizer Inc.,   Johnson & Johnson  and  Novavax Inc.  But during the first half of 2021, the majority of planned deliveries from the facility are for the vaccine developed by  AstraZeneca  PLC and Oxford University. For the whole year, the AstraZeneca vaccine is forecast to make up about one-third of Covax supplies, assuming that the shots by J&J and Novavax and other manufacturers get authorized as expected.<br />Covax says it has negotiated deals for about 2.27 billion doses of vaccines this year, although many are for shots that have yet to be authorized or are still in clinical trials. All vaccines, except the J&J one, require two doses and some of them will go to the self-financing countries.</td>

      <td>Health-worker unions in Europe say thousands of their members refuse to take one of the three Covid-19 vaccines available in the region because of concerns over efficacy and reports of side effects, the latest setback for the continent’s slow vaccine rollout.<br />Organizations representing health professionals across Europe said this week that doctors and nurses shouldn’t be forced to take the vaccine developed by  AstraZeneca  PLC because it was shown to offer less robust protection against Covid-19 than the other two currently authorized in the European Union. They also expressed concern over reports that the AstraZeneca vaccine appeared to cause stronger reactions in recipients.<br />Hospitals said hundreds of health professionals scheduled to get the vaccines hadn’t shown up for their appointments in recent days while many who had got the shot were calling in sick after reporting painful headaches, fever and other symptoms.<br />Politicians and scientists insisted this week that the AstraZeneca shot had been proven to work safely and that not using it would undermine the fight against the pandemic in Europe. The vaccine showed efficacy of around 62% in late-stage clinical trial results reported last year. Further data suggested the overall effectiveness was around 70%, if doses were spaced out longer. That compared with over 90% effectiveness in trials of competing vaccines. However, trials of all authorized vaccines, including AstraZeneca’s, found that they offered 100% protection from severe illness, hospitalizations and death.<br />A spokesman for AstraZeneca, which developed its vaccine with the University of Oxford, said: “Our vaccine has been authorized in more than 50 countries across four continents. There have been no confirmed serious adverse events associated with vaccination,” the spokesman said.</td>

He will be senior policy adviser and of counsel at that law firm.<br />At Apollo, Mr. Clayton, who is well regarded on Wall Street, will join a firm that is in transition following revelations of ties between Chief Executive Leon Black and the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. An independent review by the law firm Dechert LLP revealed that Mr. Black paid Epstein a total of $158 million for tax- and estate-planning services, far more than was previously known.<br />It found no evidence that Mr. Black was involved in the criminal activities of Epstein, who was indicted in 2019 on federal sex-trafficking charges involving underage girls and later killed himself in jail.<br />Mr. Black last month said he would step down as Apollo CEO by the time he turns 70 in July, ceding the role to co-founder Marc Rowan. Mr. Black, who will remain chairman, recommended that the board appoint more independent directors and move to eliminate Apollo’s dual-class share structure.</td>

Profit at Barclays’s corporate and investment bank rose 29% to £2.55 billion.<br />Barclays shares traded 2% lower on the results.

The proposed dividend of one pence a share was less than some investors were expecting.<br />The results support the strategy of Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley, who has fended off demands from activist investor Edward Bramson to scale back the investment bank.

European lenders with large securities-trading units, such as Deutsche Bank AG and BNP Paribas SA, have fared better in the pandemic.<br />Barclays is the U.K.’s second-largest lender by assets after  HSBC Holdings  PLC, operating a large domestic retail and commercial bank as well as a trans-Atlantic investment bank that competes with the likes of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and  Morgan Stanley .</td>

Low share prices allow small-time traders to more easily accumulate stakes and can sometimes signify cheap valuations. Share prices of lightly traded stocks can more easily be pushed higher or lower than shares of stocks that are more frequently traded.<br />Big companies with high stock prices and volume—like the third-most-mentioned company last year, Apple Inc.—tend to be unswayed by what happens on the message board, according to Hudson Cashdan, co-founder of TopStonks.com, a website that tracks equities mentioned on Reddit.<br />The success stories often share common traits with stocks selected by pros.

      <td>Just a few weeks ago, Fernando Tatís Jr. didn’t want to talk much about his future. Asked about the possibility of signing a long-term extension with the San Diego Padres, he deflected.<br />“I’m not going to say much, but I’d love to stay in San Diego,” Tatís said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal. “Hopefully we can work it out.”<br />Suffice it to say they did just that—and it will result in Tatís signing the longest contract in baseball history.<br />Tatís, the 22-year-old shortstop widely viewed as baseball’s brightest young star, agreed to a 14-year deal with the Padres worth $340 million Wednesday night, possibly tying himself to San Diego for most or all of his career. In terms of total dollars, Tatís’s deal ranks third all-time, trailing only Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts (12 years, $365 million) and Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout (10 years, $360 million).<br />In one crucial way, Tatís’s contract stands alone. Betts inked his pact at the age of 27, with six strong seasons for the Boston Red Sox and a MVP award on his résumé. Trout had already established himself as the undisputed best player on the planet when he signed his deal to remain in Anaheim the rest of his professional life.</td>

The funds, which currently focus on U.S. stocks, are cheaper alternatives to mutual funds and give portfolio managers the chance to try to beat the market without running the risk of being copied or front-run.

Analysts expected a loss of about 566 million Swiss francs.<br />Even in a difficult year, Credit Suisse fared better than many European rivals because its lending in Switzerland and to the global rich held up in the pandemic. Along with Wall Street competitors, its investment bank booked bumper fees from clients trading in last year’s gyrating markets and from companies raising capital or needing deal advice. On Thursday, it said its investment banking arm made a $318 million pretax profit in the fourth quarter, with the biggest revenue contribution coming from stock and bond deals.<br />Fourth-quarter pretax profit also rose in Credit Suisse’s Asia-Pacific division, by 18% to 237 million Swiss francs, while revenue and pretax profit fell at its Swiss bank and international wealth management unit.<br />It was a tumultuous year for Switzerland’s second-largest bank by assets, after rival  UBS Group AG .

Central bankers and finance ministries have opened the cash sluices, and what looks like a speculative boom is under way in many corners of global financial markets. But over the past 12 months, the yellow metal—the original darling of skeptics of spendthrift governments—has underperformed the S&P 500.<br />At a bit below $1,800 a troy ounce, gold prices are far below the highs of around $2,050 reached in early August.<br />Watching bitcoin hit $50,000, SoftBank’s stock price surpass its dot-com boom high and even silver catch a bid from retail traders must be particularly difficult for holders of gold. Many had expected that the original speculative asset would prosper under the unusual market conditions of the past year.<br />Bank of America  commodity analysts announced an 18-month gold price target of $3,000 in April, before paring it back later in 2020. That forecast was made on the reasonable-seeming assumption that the bulging balance sheets of major central banks and huge fiscal rescue packages would be a boost to the asset most traditionally favored by investors worried about government profligacy.<br />But it simply hasn’t worked out that way. The metal’s recent performance should be confirmation, if any were really needed, that buyers of gold are really just buying inflation-protected government bonds under a different name. Since 2005, the yield on 10-year TIPS—inflation indexed U.S. government bonds—has had an R-squared relationship of 0.81 with the daily price of gold, meaning the moves in one explain the majority of moves in the other.</td>

      <td>TOKYO—The Tokyo Olympic organizing committee named a cabinet minister and female Olympic bronze medalist as its new chief after the previous leader resigned over sexist remarks.<br />Seiko Hashimoto, 56, becomes one of the few women atop a major organization in Japan, where almost all big-company chief executives are men.<br />The decision Thursday comes just five months before the scheduled opening of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo on July 23, with much still uncertain about how the Games can proceed under pandemic conditions. Officials say they haven’t decided yet whether to let in foreign spectators.<br />Japan began vaccinating its population against Covid-19 this week under a schedule that makes it likely most people won’t have shots by the start of the Games. The International Olympic Committee is encouraging athletes to get shots although it says vaccination isn’t a prerequisite for competing at the Games.<br />Ms. Hashimoto has been a member of Parliament’s upper house since 1995 and serves in Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s cabinet as Olympics minister, a post she is giving up to take on the presidency of the Olympic organizing committee.</td>

      <td>The Justice Department charged three people at a contractor for the U.S. Navy in Japan with fraud involving the alleged dumping of waste from U.S. warships for more than a decade.<br />Sojiro Imahashi, president and chief executive of Kanto Kosan Co., as well as company managers Tsuyoshi Ifuku and Yuki Yamamiya allegedly conspired to bill the Navy under contracts to treat wastewater from U.S. ships from 2007 to 2020 but instead dumped contaminated water into Japanese harbors, according to the indictment.<br />“The defendants deceived the U.S. Navy by willfully failing to satisfy the company’s obligations under $120 million in contracts,” said acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid. He said the contracts called for compliance with environmental safeguards.<br />When The Wall Street Journal reported on the investigation into suspected dumping in 2019, Kanto Kosan denied any wrongdoing. Reached on Thursday after the indictment, Mr. Yamamiya, Kanto Kosan’s general manager, said: “We’re puzzled and currently consulting with our lawyer about what action to take. For now, we can’t make any further comment.”<br />A spokeswoman for the Seventh Fleet said Kanto Kosan continues to provide wastewater treatment for the Navy in Japan. Kanto Kosan services U.S. Navy vessels in the Seventh Fleet’s home port of Yokosuka, on the south edge of Tokyo Bay; at Sasebo, in western Japan; and on the island of Okinawa, in the far south.</td>

      <td>An electricity grid that relies on renewables also needs nuclear or coal power.</td>
      <td>While millions of Texans remain without power for a third day, the wind industry and its advocates are spinning a fable that gas, coal and nuclear plants—not their frozen turbines—are to blame. PolitiFact proclaims “Natural gas, not wind turbines, main driver of Texas power shortage.” Climate-change conformity is hard for the media to resist, but we don’t mind. So here are the facts to cut through the spin.<br />Texas energy regulators were already warning of rolling blackouts late last week as temperatures in western Texas plunged into the 20s, causing wind turbines to freeze. Natural gas and coal-fired plants ramped up to cover the wind power shortfall as demand for electricity increased with falling temperatures.<br />Some readers have questioned our reporting Wednesday ("The Political Making of a Texas Power Outage") that wind’s share of electricity generation in Texas plunged to 8% from 42%. How can that be, they wonder, when the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot) has reported that it counts on wind to meet only 10% of its winter capacity.<br />Ercot’s disclosure is slippery. Start with the term “capacity,” which means potential maximum output. This is different than actual power generation. Texas has a total winter capacity of about 83 megawatts (MW) including all power sources. Total power demand and generation, however, at their peak are usually only around 57 MW. Regulators build slack into the system.<br />Texas has about 30,000 MW of wind capacity, but winds aren’t constant or predictable. Winds this past month have generated between about 600 and 22,500 MW. Regulators don’t count on wind to provide much more than 10% or so of the grid’s total capacity since they can’t command turbines to increase power like they can coal and gas plants.</td>

Some, such as  Devon Energy Corp. , have begun to loosen the purse strings as the market improves.<br />For now, though, many frackers are unable to take advantage of the rally as they work to restore as much as roughly one-third of the nation’s oil production. The winter storm that left millions without power this week knocked out as much as 2.5 million barrels a day in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford of Texas and one million in other oil-rich states, traders estimated.<br />Icy roads have blocked service crews from reaching wells, and analysts estimated the disruptions could affect production through March. It will take weeks to determine exactly how many barrels will have been lost to the storm, Devon Chief Executive Richard Muncrief said.<br />In earnings calls this week, shale executives said they are sticking to capital discipline, which has become a mantra of the industry following a yearslong push by investors.</td>

It’s hardly an easy task, but it’s an important one. Mr. Macron is right to conclude it’s vital to France’s future—and we'd add, to America’s.<br />Mr. Macron and ministers in his government in recent months have been fighting illiberal and divisive philosophies they say emanate from American universities. Mr. Macron in October decried the influence of “certain social-science theories entirely imported from the United States.”<br />He means in particular the habit of viewing most matters in racial terms—a core tenet of “wokeness”—and his government wants educational institutions to eschew it. Minister for Higher Education Frédérique Vidal this week promised an investigation into academics “looking at everything through the prism of wanting to fracture and divide.”<br />This is part of a broader drive to reassert French values after many years of Islamist terror attacks. Mr. Macron also is pushing for a new crackdown on religious extremism, and his law to that end passed through one chamber of the National Assembly this week.<br />Mr. Macron’s political and philosophical insight is to tie together the fight against violent extremism from outside France and the defense of democratic values within. His October speech detailing his new plan for combating Islamism included a warning that a focus on “post-colonial or anti-colonial” discourse constitutes a form of “self-hatred” of France that allows Islamism to flourish. Officials such as Ms. Vidal also warn against “Islamo-leftism.”</td>

      <td>Democrat are selling a $1.9 trillion spending bill as a Covid relief measure, but buried in the fine print are policy choices far removed from the pandemic, such as a $22 billion tax increase on multinational companies.<br />Daniel Bunn, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, has the details. When a U.S. company with foreign subsidiaries does its taxes, it attributes some of its interest expense to its overseas income. But that allocation might not reflect reality if the divisions abroad also take out their own debt.<br />“This could get to the point,” Mr. Bunn wrote last week, “that the company’s foreign tax credits do not accurately reflect taxes paid, resulting in double taxation.”<br />In 2004 Congress passed a law, which took effect this year, that allows interest allocations on a “worldwide basis,” meaning they might even flow from the subsidiary to the parent company, “depending on the level of expenses and where income is earned,” Mr. Bunn writes. “This allows better alignment of expenses and income for the purpose of calculating foreign tax credits.” The House version of the latest Covid-19 relief bill would permanently eliminate this provision.<br />Taxation of multinationals is complex, and the point here isn’t to defend every jot and tittle of the current internal revenue code. But this tweak is a tax increase, period. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates it will raise $22.3 billion in revenue through 2031. That’s also why this improvement to the tax code that passed Congress in 2004, the year  Facebook  was founded and before the iPhone existed, spent a decade and a half in limbo: It was repeatedly delayed by lawmakers scrounging for cash.</td>

After a seven-month, 292-million-mile journey, NASA’s biggest, fastest and brainiest rover ever—Perseverance—is nearing its highly anticipated touchdown on the Red Planet.<br />The $2.7 billion rover, which is scheduled to land at 3:55 p.m. EST on Thursday, embodies the latest and most ambitious effort by NASA to find evidence of past life on Mars. Though it is now a barren place of icy dunes, dust devils, dead volcanoes and subzero winds, scientists believe Mars in its remote past may have been a comparatively lush, warm world—one suitable for the chemistry of life.<br />“It will attempt to answer an age-old question that has eluded humanity for generations: whether life has ever existed elsewhere beyond our own planet,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the space agency’s science mission directorate in Washington, said of the Perseverance mission.<br />Bristling with sensors, cameras, microphones and a robotic arm, the one-ton, SUV-size Perseverance rover is designed to look for rock or soil specimens that might harbor evidence of ancient life and pack what it finds into small tubes, to be cached for retrieval by future missions and brought back to Earth for analysis. NASA and the European Space Agency are discussing several mission scenarios that might return these samples by 2031, NASA officials said.<br />During its two-year mission, Perseverance will roam the surface and look for traces of organic matter, which could be evidence of primordial microbes or other simple life-forms. Other places in the solar system—from the searing clouds of Venus to the frozen oceans of moons around Jupiter and Saturn—might also have the potential for life. But those places are considered even more inaccessible than Mars.</td>

      <td>Some economists warn about too much spending, but too little could hurt the economy more.</td>
      <td>A big tempest is brewing in a big teapot over President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan. Republican objections are to be expected. But some of the objections come from nominally Democratic economists, led by former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. This is a surprise.<br />The Biden plan isn’t perfect. But with today’s enormous uncertainties, no one can possibly know what the “right” plan really is.<br />Here’s an analogy. I recently listened to a wonderful scientific seminar. At one point, a scientist who was obviously very knowledgeable about vaccines asked a scientist from the pharmaceutical industry how researchers had decided on the dosage in each shot (which struck him as large) and the interval between the first and second shots (which struck him as short).<br />I’ll paraphrase the answer: We were in the middle of a pandemic. We didn’t want to take any chances of underdosing people, and we wanted to get vaccines into people’s arms fast. That response both acknowledged the huge scientific uncertainties and displayed a keen sense of how asymmetric the risks were. Underdosing and waiting too long between shots meant more sickness and death. Overdosing and giving second shots at shorter intervals did not.<br />That is not unlike designing an economic relief program. No one knows either the exactly correct dosage or the precisely correct timing. Only history will judge whether the program was too small or too big—and even then with much guesswork. But the risks in each direction are not symmetric.</td>

But in defining America's future national strategy, the new administration should take this process a step further.<br />China’s long-term strategy stretches beyond the issues of trade policy, great power rivalry, nuclear proliferation and military expansion. Largely unexamined in the public debate is China’s pursuit of massive infrastructure projects in developing countries, where it seeks to cement long-term relations. These economic and diplomatic ties are an extension of power—with China’s military and security involvement justified as necessary to protect its interests.<br />China seeks to be the world’s most powerful country, and its Belt and Road Initiative is an important component of its strategy. As a safeguard to our diplomatic and economic health the U.S. should recalibrate its own approach to often ignored nations, even as we continue to meet the more traditional national security challenges that dominate the headlines.<br />Much of the world is becoming uneasy with China’s unremitting aggression on its home turf in Asia. Over the past decade China has been calling its own shots, rejecting international law and public opinion while signaling that it intends to replace the U.S. as the region’s dominant military, diplomatic and economic power. Beijing has taken down Hong Kong’s democracy movement; started military spats with India; disrupted life for tens of millions by damming the headwaters of the Mekong River; conducted what the U.S. government now deems a campaign of genocide against Muslim Uighurs; escalated tensions with Japan over the Senkaku Islands; consolidated its illegal occupation of islands in the South China Sea; and made repeated bellicose gestures designed to test the international community’s resistance to “unifying” the “renegade province” of Taiwan.<br />While any of these and similar moves could expand into major crises, they already have raised suspicions across the international community. The BRI has to date remained a separate matter, but the cumulative effect of Beijing’s relentless provocations has given pause to many of China’s third-world partners in economic development.</td>

Perhaps unsurprisingly, we became fast friends. He’s earned the nickname “Sunshine” among my friend group for his positive disposition and, like the character in “Remember the Titans,” his wholesome good looks.<br />Our shared interests came up again last month as Sunshine and I chatted while running together. I admitted that while my love of Jerry and Bob hadn’t waned, I had fallen out of the habit of saying the prayer that once brought me such calm. “Funny,” he said. “It was your sticker that first challenged me to up my game.” We jogged on in silence, and I didn’t think much more of the exchange.<br />Two weeks later, Sunshine found me in the narthex of our church right before Sunday Mass. There he pressed into my palm a handmade set of rosary beads he’d ordered for me. I was surprised because I hadn’t asked for them; not verbally, anyway. It was just his way of doing me a good turn.</td>

      <td>In the early 1980s, dressed in a bespoke dark velvet three-piece suit and ruffled white silk shirt, my young English friend met me for dinner at the prestigious 21 Club restaurant. He was detained at the door. Where was his tie? After a brief discussion, a 21 Club tie, festooned with jockeys, was draped over the ruffles and we were escorted to Siberia. Richard Thompson Ford calls that 21 Club tie a “badge of shame.”<br />There are many badges of shame recorded in “Dress Codes,” a sharp and entertaining history of the rules of fashion. In his introduction Mr. Ford, a Stanford law professor and cultural critic, writes that he learned his sense of style from his father, a trained tailor and an ordained minister. “For years my dad endured my sartorial misadventures (asymmetrical ‘new-wave’ haircuts, nylon parachute pants, the ‘punk’ look, which consisted of deliberately torn garments held together with safety pins or duct tape) in quiet despair.” In the end the author followed his father’s example and came to appreciate the virtues of tailored suits, polished dress shoes and crisp shirts. So much so that in 2009 he decided to enter Esquire magazine’s Best Dressed Real Man contest.<br />Among the book’s illustrations is a snapshot of the author in a smart pinstripe suit, his arms around his squirming daughter. It helped Mr. Ford gain sixth place in the contest, but he blew the interview. “I knew intuitively why I wore what I did, but I could not explain it to save my life.”<br />“Dress Codes” is his belated but eloquent response. In a jam-packed, fact-filled survey, Mr. Ford skillfully examines how fashion, far from being mere frivolity, has shaped people’s lives from the 14th century to the present. His wide-ranging research is punctuated with quotations from such cultural observers as the semiotician Roland Barthes, designer Miuccia Prada (who like Barthes saw fashion as “a wearable language”), historian Anne Hollander and economist Thorstein Veblen.<br />Joan of Arc was one of history’s first fashion victims, burned at the stake for heresy. Among her crimes: the wearing of men’s clothes. In some 15th-century Italian cities, Christian women were forbidden to wear earrings (symbols of sin), while for Jewish women it was compulsory. During the Renaissance, sumptuous attire—furs, velvet, silks—was a way of asserting social dominance, and sumptuary laws kept upstarts in their place.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal agents have seized approximately 10 million counterfeit N95 face masks bearing the  3M Co.  logo in recent weeks, officials said Wednesday, as they urged thousands of hospitals and medical facilities to stop using suspected fakes.<br />The Department of Homeland Security said the counterfeit masks were made in China. The most recent interdiction occurred Wednesday, with the seizure of hundreds of thousands of masks from an East Coast warehouse at an undisclosed location.<br />Acting on leads from 3M, DHS officials said they have seized counterfeit items in five states and have opened criminal investigations.<br />“They are extremely dangerous,” Steve Francis, director of the Intellectual Property Center for DHS’s Homeland Security Investigations unit said at a news conference. “They are providing a false sense of security to our first-line responders and to the American consumers.”<br />Officials said grammatical errors or typos on packaging or user instructions are telltale signs of counterfeit items. They said they have contacted about 6,000 hospitals, clinics and others who may have purchased counterfeit masks, urging them to stop using the masks and contact DHS immediately.</td>

His interview in February with federal agents suggests the probe into Ms. Holmes remains active ahead of her July trial.<br />The U.S. attorney’s office in the Northern District of California accuses Ms. Holmes and Theranos’s former chief operating officer, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, of misleading investors and patients about the company’s technology, which purported to test for a range of health conditions with a single finger prick and a few drops of blood. The two have pleaded not guilty to criminal fraud, with Mr. Balwani set to face trial separately next January.<br />During an hourlong Feb. 1 interview recounted in a Tuesday court filing, Dr. Das told federal agents about his work with Theranos from December 2015 until he was laid off in June 2018, months before the company dissolved. By the time he became director of the startup’s Newark, Calif., lab, the facility was under scrutiny by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.<br />Theranos was also facing public pressure after The Wall Street Journal revealed in late 2015 that the company ran few tests on its proprietary machines, which produced unreliable results, and instead performed most tests with commercial analyzers that it bought from other companies and sometimes altered.</td>

      <td>If any media folk are still interested in “fact-checking” presidents after the Trump era, they’ll have plenty of fodder from Tuesday night’s appearance by President Joe Biden on CNN. A favorite Biden habit is to appeal to the authority of economists, many of whom remain unnamed, to suggest that his policies are wildly popular among experts. And what would we do without anonymous experts?<br />Newsweek has a transcript of the event in which CNN’s Anderson Cooper hosted our 46th president at Milwaukee’s Pabst Theater. Here’s an excerpt:<br />Thank goodness this statement is not accurate. There is not an “overwhelming consensus” among economists that no amount of federal spending is excessive. This column is often skeptical of conventional expert opinion. But even for those who aren’t, the Biden economic plan is notable for the way it has drawn criticism not just from economists in the center and on the right but from Mr. Biden’s own former colleagues on the left. Many of the critiques specifically warn that he is indeed spending too much taxpayer money on a recovering economy which does not need another massive intervention.<br />Last month this column noted the criticism of Bidenomics from veterans of the Obama economic team. More recently one of the Biden plan’s enthusiastic backers also acknowledged the resistance coming from liberal economists. John Cassidy wrote in the New Yorker:<br />One can usually count on massive federal programs to be counterproductive, such as the one Mr. Biden helped oversee as Vice President in 2009 and which he reasonably described on Tuesday as “the last experiment we had with stimulus.” Unreasonably for taxpayers, the experiment failed as the plan burned through more than $800 billion and failed miserably to reach its employment goals.</td>

Mr. Kim also has said the Cuomo administration was engaged in a coverup related to nursing-home deaths.<br />“He attacked me and said that I obstructed justice in a letter today,” Mr. Cuomo said of Mr. Kim. “He said today that the immunity bill was because of my political contributors. Those are very harsh accusations.”<br />“If you don’t correct the disinformation, it perpetuates,” Mr. Cuomo added.<br />The governor has come under fire from Democratic and Republican leaders following the disclosure that his administration didn’t fully release information regarding Covid-19 deaths in the state’s nursing homes out of its fear that former President Trump’s administration would politicize the information. That concern prompted the Cuomo administration to withhold information from state lawmakers regarding how many nursing-home residents died from the virus after they were transferred to hospitals, citing the continuing probe by the U.S. Department of Justice.</td>

And vaccinating an entire town will counter Brazil’s growing anti-vax movement and demonstrate the wider benefits of mass immunization, such as a quick economic recovery expected with a fast reopening of Serrana.<br />“It will give us information about the percentage of people who need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity—no one knows this yet,” said Marcos Borges, a professor of medicine at the University of São Paulo in nearby Ribeirão Preto who is leading the study.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats are bracing for an internal battle over raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, as they grappled with the political and procedural constraints on reaching a long-held goal of the party’s progressive wing.<br />Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan proposes to do by 2025, faces opposition from some Democratic lawmakers and parliamentary hurdles. Democrats cannot afford to lose a single vote in the 50-50 Senate on the relief package, which also calls for sending many Americans a $1,400 direct check, bolstering federal unemployment aid, and offering funds for vaccine distribution and testing.<br />At a CNN town hall event on Tuesday, Mr. Biden floated the possibility of raising the minimum wage to $12 or $13 an hour by 2025, rather than $15.  “I do support a $15 minimum wage,” Mr. Biden said. “But that’s a debatable issue.”<br />Press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday Mr. Biden continues to back the $15 wage but noted his aid proposal “included many other components.” She added that the legislation “may not look the same way when it comes out of the sausage-making machine” in Congress.<br />While many Republicans have assailed the proposed wage increase, arguing that it would hurt small businesses and cost jobs, Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas said Tuesday they would soon introduce their own legislation to raise the minimum wage. The two Republicans said they would pair the gradual wage increase with a requirement that employers verify the immigration status of their employees—likely a nonstarter with Democrats. The pair haven’t yet specified what level they would raise the wage.</td>

      <td>A familiar voice in American media and politics has gone quiet. Rush Limbaugh, the most listened-to radio host in America for 30 years, died Wednesday at age 70.<br />We recall how bracing the Rush Limbaugh Show was in its early days. For decades the airwaves had been governed by the Fairness Doctrine, a federal regulation requiring stations to balance “controversial” claims with “contrasting viewpoints.” The rule gave incumbent candidates and mainstream news outlets a near-monopoly on public discourse. Ronald Reagan scrapped the Fairness Doctrine in 1987. By the 1992 presidential campaign, the radio star’s first name was known across the U.S.<br />Limbaugh, whose show ran on weekdays from noon to 3 p.m. East Coast time, was invaluable to the conservative movement in the 1990s. He would spend an hour explaining supply-side tax policy or making the case for deregulation. Millions of Americans had never heard a coherent argument against the welfare state or Roe v. Wade until they tuned in to Limbaugh’s show. He played an enormous role in popularizing conservative ideas and policies.<br />His critics called him a racist and about everything else, which was always unfair. His real offense was to gain millions of weekly listeners by mocking the left’s pieties. He dissected environmental scare campaigns, and he ridiculed the news media for finding epidemics of homelessness only during Republican administrations. In 1994 Bill Clinton called the show from Air Force One to complain about the host’s criticisms—not for the last time blaming scrappy radio hosts for his own political woes.<br />In recent years, with the rise of more acerbic competitors and a general souring of public discourse, Limbaugh took on a more exasperated tone. He also moved to the Trumpian right on issues such as trade, immigration and foreign policy.</td>

The directors’ departure could be announced as soon as Wednesday, this person said.<br />Mr. Collins, former chief executive of medical device-maker  Medtronic PLC ,  has been a Boeing board member since 2007. Ms. Schwab, a former U.S. trade representative, has been on the board since 2010.<br />The departures have been under consideration in recent weeks and are part of a longer-term push to bring new directors onto the board in the aftermath of the MAX crisis, some of the people familiar with the matter said. Four members of the expected 10-member board will have been added after the accidents.<br />Boeing’s board has faced scrutiny from investors and U.S. lawmakers ever since two of its 737 MAX jets crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, claiming 346 lives. A year ago, the board added two new directors with safety and engineering experience as two longtime members stepped down. Since the accidents, Boeing’s board has also added a permanent safety committee and split the roles of chairman and chief executive.</td>
