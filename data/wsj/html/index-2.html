      <td>Key moments and themes from Thursday’s session as House managers finished making their case</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The third day of former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial brought to a climax House managers’ case for convicting him, as they focused squarely on his actions during and after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Here are five takeaways from the trial’s third day:<br />Rep. Diana DeGette (D., Colo.) opened the day with a presentation focused on the perspectives of the rioters themselves, many of whom have said they had overrun the Capitol because they believed Mr. Trump directed them to do so. One man shown on a video stream said: “Our president wants us here. We wait and take orders from our president.” A Trump lawyer criticized Democrats for showing the videos of rioters citing the former president as a reason for assaulting the Capitol. “I think it’s offensive, quite frankly,” David Schoen told reporters. “It’s an antithesis of the healing process to continue to show the tragedy that happened here, that Donald Trump has condemned, and I think it tears at the American people, quite frankly.”<br />The Democratic managers argued that a key reason to convict Mr. Trump was to stop the same kind of violence from happening again. “We are not here to punish Donald Trump,” Ms. DeGette said. “We are here to prevent the seeds of hatred that he planted from bearing any fruit.” Rep. Ted Lieu (D., Calif.) said: “If we let him get away with it and then it comes to your state capital or it comes back here again, what are we going to say?” He added: “I’m not afraid of Donald Trump running again in four years. I’m afraid he’s going to run again and lose. Because he can do this again.”<br />Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, countered arguments made by Mr. Trump’s attorneys that the former president’s words in the lead-up to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol were “well within the norms of political speech that is protected by the First Amendment,” as they wrote in a recent brief. Mr. Raskin cited a 1969 landmark Supreme Court case in which the high court found that the government couldn’t prohibit free speech and free press “except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.” He compared Mr. Trump to a “fire chief who incites a mob to go set the theater on fire, and not only refuses to put out the fire, but encourages the mob to keep going as the blaze spreads.”<br />As the third session of the trial kicked off, several senators were hunched over their desks or leaning back. Some spent periods outside the chamber or stood watching the proceedings from the back. At one point, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) hung his head and appeared to be resting. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) switched between taking notes, fiddling with his pen and picking his fingernails. Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) was writing on a blank map of Asia. He studied what appeared to be a map of Southeast Asia during Wednesday’s proceedings.</td>

      <td>New York City authorities raided a Long Island City warehouse that they said held more than 1.7 million counterfeit N95 masks, marking one of the biggest single seizures of personal protective equipment since the pandemic began.<br />The Queens County District Attorney’s office, which spearheaded the investigation, charged Zhi Zeng, the warehouse manager, with felony trademark counterfeiting on Wednesday. If convicted, the 33-year-old Brooklyn man faces up to 15 years in prison. Other individuals are under investigation.<br />Authorities said the warehouse was “an elaborate production assembly line” for the counterfeit masks. They also found hundreds of thousands of pieces of other personal protective equipment in the warehouse, including disinfecting wipes, children’s masks, and gowns.<br />“We are living in a horrible pandemic with more than 450,000 Americans dead from Covid-19. This defendant allegedly sold false hope and security and was set to sell more of these counterfeit masks to whomever would pay his price,” Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said.<br />Acting on a tip, law enforcement raided the two-story warehouse in Long Island City earlier this week, and discovered more than 100 shipping pallets “piled high with boxes of 3M-labeled N95 masks,” according to the district attorney’s office. Mr. Zeng, who pleaded not guilty on Wednesday, was present at the time.</td>

      <td>Walt Disney Co.  typically reports its first-quarter earnings with news of a Christmas Day blockbuster performance at the box office, or a holiday surge in theme-park attendance. On Thursday, however, the company again demonstrated how Covid-19 has brutalized its bottom line.<br />Still, its quarter beat pessimistic Wall Street estimates, and Disney registered a profit of $17 million, or one cent a share. The blow came from Disney’s legacy businesses: Two-thirds of North American movie theaters remain closed, and Disneyland is closed to anyone who isn’t showing up for a Covid-19 vaccine shot.<br />In the comparable period a year ago, before the Covid-19 pandemic started to affect the U.S., its profit was $2.11 billion, or $1.16 a share.<br />Disney’s first-quarter profit comes after the company reported two quarterly losses in a row. But in a sign of how much has changed at the world’s largest entertainment company, Disney’s quarterly profit was about 2% of the domestic box-office gross of the company’s top-performing 2019 release, “Avengers: Endgame.”<br />With the traditional movie business hurting, Bob Chapek, approaching his first anniversary as Disney’s chief executive, reiterated the shift toward a streaming-first model.</td>

      <td>His nominee for deputy Labor secretary presided over $11.4 billion in jobless benefits fraud.</td>
      <td>Progressives like to say these days that the Biden Administration is bringing California’s values to the rest of America, and alas that seems to be true. Consider the nomination of California Labor secretary Julie Su to be deputy U.S. Labor secretary after presiding over a gargantuan unemployment benefits fraud.<br />California has paid some $120 billion in unemployment benefits during the pandemic, nearly a quarter of all payouts nationwide. That alone suggests a governance problem. Yet Ms. Su last month disclosed that $11.4 billion has gone to foreign cyber-criminals, prison inmates and other scammers. Another $19 billion in potentially fraudulent claims are under investigation.<br />Local district attorneys and the feds have in recent months brought charges against some of the thieves. They include a former labor agency employee who allegedly filed 100 phony claims in other people’s names that totalled up to $2 million. A $21,000 payment to California Sen. Dianne Feinstein tipped off local investigators but not state workers who paid the claim.<br />Fraud appears to have been pervasive in state prisons with at least one phony claim filed from each facility. Prison payments have added up to more than $800 million. At least 133 death row inmates, including the well-known convicted killer Scott Peterson, had claims filed in their names.<br />One entrepreneurial inmate gathered personal information from her fellow prisoners and shared their details with a parolee who filed claims in their names. The government lost a mere $200,000 on that scam. Unlike the Maserati that one drug trafficker used his phony benefits to buy, the government can’t confiscate the parolee's spoils. She spent it on plastic surgery.</td>

      <td>He’s a ‘patriot,’ a man of faith and courage, Democrats now say.</td>
      <td>One novel, even astonishing, spectacle in President Trump’s impeachment trial has been progressive Democrats singing the praises of Mike Pence. “The Vice President and I don’t agree on too much in politics,” Rep. Joaquin Castro told the Senate jurors Wednesday. “But he’s a man who upholds his oath, his faith, his duty, and most of all upholds the Constitution.”<br />A moment later Mr. Castro called Mr. Pence “a patriot.” Other Democrats concur. “Vice President Pence had the courage to stand against the President, tell the American public the truth, and uphold our Constitution,” said Stacey Plaskett, the delegate for the Virgin Islands. “That is patriotism.” Rep. Ted Lieu said Mr. Pence “stood his ground, like our other brave officials stood their ground.” He added: “Vice President Pence showed us what it means to be an American, what it means to show courage.”<br />Mr. Pence is probably en route to Walter Reed with symptoms of acute whiplash. For years he has been mocked as a Trump bootlicker, a religious weirdo and bigot. In a 2019 tweet directed at Mr. Pence, Mr. Lieu said he hoped “your hate of LGBTQ employees and students will one day dissipate.” On July 16, 2018, Mr. Castro tweeted: “Mike Pence @VP is a Trump zombie at this point.”<br />Recall the furor in 2015 when Mr. Pence, as Indiana’s Governor, signed a state Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Or remember the coverage of Mr. Pence’s years-ago comment that he wouldn’t go to dinner alone with a woman not his wife. Amid the pushing for a first impeachment of Mr. Trump, the media offered grave warnings that President Pence might be even worse.<br />All that is now forgotten, but don’t expect this strange new respect on the left for Mr. Pence to last. As soon as the second impeachment trial wraps, he will go back to being another dark figure in a political “Handmaid’s Tale” told to inspire fear and loathing among Democratic voters. But for everyone else, Mr. Pence’s defense of the rule of law and the Electoral College should stand as a refutation of that caricature.</td>

Taylor and his son Peter M. Taylor could be on a plane to Japan as soon as Friday, barring any last-minute legal intervention.<br />Lawyers for the Taylors didn’t respond to a request for comment.<br />The Taylors were arrested in May at their family home near Boston by federal authorities acting at the behest of Japanese prosecutors. They have spent the past nine months in a county jail, fighting multiple court battles to avoid being sent to Japan to face criminal charges in the escape.<br />A former chief executive of Nissan Motor Co., Mr. Ghosn was facing financial crime charges in Japan and living in a court-monitored house in Tokyo when he disappeared in late 2019. In a plot worthy of Hollywood, he took a bullet train 300 miles from Tokyo to Osaka, then was smuggled inside the huge box onto a waiting private jet.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden said the U.S. has struck deals to purchase 200 million more Covid-19 vaccine doses, following a pledge in January to boost the number of shots available for Americans.<br />Mr. Biden said in a speech at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., that the U.S. signed contracts with  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna Inc.  that require each company to provide an additional 100 million vaccine doses.<br />“We have to stay vigilant, we have to stay focused and for God’s sake, we have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. We can do this,” the president said.<br />The additional vaccines will bring the total number of doses ordered by the U.S. from the two companies to 600 million from 400 million. The administration said in January that it was working on the purchases, which would provide enough supply to vaccinate 300 million Americans in a two-dose regimen, covering all individuals in the U.S. currently eligible to receive the vaccine. The vaccine hasn’t been approved for people under 16 years old.<br />The U.S. also has supply contracts with other companies, including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca PLC and  Novavax Inc.  to provide a combined 500 million doses. These vaccines have not been cleared by regulators, although J&J’s is currently under view for emergency use.</td>

      <td>Strong streaming growth has propelled stock to a record valuation, despite pandemic’s continued pain</td>
      <td>Walt  Disney Co.  has sold its streaming story well. Investors will soon need to start paying attention to the other parts of the empire, though.<br />The entertainment giant’s fiscal first-quarter results reported Thursday afternoon were essentially a repeat of its last update. Customers continue to flock to the company’s streaming offerings but much less to its theme parks and other parts of the company’s business that depend on crowds. Revenue of $16.25 billion edged the Wall Street consensus of $15.9 billion, while operating income of $29 million was nearly double the consensus forecast—even though it also diminished by 99% from the same period last year.<br />Disney’s share price still rose a further 2% after hours following the results. Investors have taken to focusing exclusively on the company’s successful streaming business. Disney+ hit 94.9 million paid subscribers by the end of the quarter—exceeding the 89.7 million expected by analysts, according to forecasts tabulated by Visible Alpha.<br />Disney managed to pick up 8.1 million subscribers in just the last month of the quarter, based on an update the company gave at its Dec. 10 analyst meeting. That alone is notable given the competition Disney faces from its growing raft of streaming competitors. The month included the launch of “Wonder Woman 1984” on HBO Max—the first of a slate of Warner Bros. films that will make their debuts on the service this year. But Disney is now supremely confident in its own streaming prospects; it used that Dec. 10 meeting to lay out targets to grow as big as  Netflix Inc.  by 2024, revving up an already excited investor base. Disney’s stock price has surged 23% since that meeting, compared to a 7% rise by the S&P 500 over the same period.<br />But streaming can’t float the full empire forever. Disney’s theme-park business has benefited in part from a fractured government response to the coronavirus pandemic; Florida allowed the company’s resort in Orlando to open at a reduced capacity in July, while California has said no to the same. As such, theme-park revenue rose 33% from the September quarter but was down 68% from the same period last year. Parks have also typically accounted for about one-quarter of the company’s operating income; domestic and international parks combined lost a little over $1 billion during the December quarter.</td>

      <td>New research shows how easy money can expand racial wealth gaps.</td>
      <td>President Biden ran on adding a mandate for “racial equity” to the Federal Reserve’s two current mandates of stable prices and full employment. But what does that mean in practice for monetary policy? The advocates, like Jared Bernstein of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, typically suggest it means easier money for a longer period of time.<br />Before the Fed embraces a progressive theory of social-impact monetary policy, however, it seems to be doing some due diligence. A new staff report from the New York Fed shows how a central bank focus on racial equity could make the problem worse.<br />The paper, “Monetary Policy and Racial Inequality,” looks at the asset portfolios of black and white Americans. It models the impact of Fed rate cuts on wealth and labor-market outcomes by race. If you are only focused on race gaps in the labor market, the paper finds, then easier money is modestly egalitarian: “The black unemployment rate falls by about 0.2 percentage points more than the white unemployment rate after an unexpected 100bp monetary policy shock.”<br />Yet the effect on wealth is much larger as lower rates push investors into equities seeking higher investment returns. “The same shock pushes up stock prices by as much as 5%, and house prices by over 2% over a five year period,” say the authors. Because of racial gaps in asset ownership, this translates to a 20% to 30% annual income bump for white households compared to 10% for black households.<br />That’s the Fed’s “racial equity” dilemma: Rate cuts intended to boost earnings for workers on the margins of the labor market also spur higher asset prices. After a bout of expansionary monetary policy, “the earnings gains of black households are dwarfed by the portfolio gains of white households.”</td>

      <td>Will the President restrict a useful health insurance option?</td>
      <td>The Biden team is combing the books for Trump policies to undo, and one target may be modest regulations expanding choices in health insurance. Democrats have attacked “short-term” health plans as “junk insurance,” but the evidence shows they’ve become a valuable option for millions of Americans.<br />A new paper from Brian Blase of the Galen Institute looks at how “short-term, limited duration” insurance plans have affected health-care markets since the Trump Administration expanded the option in 2018. These plans don’t have to offer the full suite of benefits required by the Affordable Care Act, and as such often cost a fraction of ACA plans.<br />The Obama Administration in 2016 capped plans at 90 days. The point was to force the young and healthy, who might otherwise be attracted to short-term plans, to pay more for coverage in the exchanges. The Trump Administration in 2018 reverted to the old standard of 364 days, with the option to renew for up to three years.<br />Nancy Pelosiaccused Mr. Trump of “railroading vulnerable families into shoddy junk health insurance plans,” never mind that anyone who preferred more comprehensive coverage could keep buying it. The real complaint is that these plans have been a refuge for those who don’t qualify for ObamaCare subsidies. The company  eHealth  said last year that the average monthly premium for plans selected by its unsubsidized customers was $456. Pair that with a deductible that can top $4,000.<br />No wonder, then, that an estimated three million Americans availed themselves of a short-term option at some point in 2019. A popular trope was that the Trump Administration was “sabotaging” ObamaCare by siphoning off healthy customers. That hasn’t happened.</td>

A hearing on the request was set for Friday morning in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn.<br />The monitor has the authority to block significant financial moves by the firm, which owns dozens of auto dealerships through its funds.

Gardemal III, a managing director with Alvarez & Marsal Holdings LLC in Washington, as the monitor.<br />Set up in 2013 by David Gentile, Jeffry Schneider and Jeffrey Lash, the firm was hit with civil actions by seven states and the SEC last week, while the three men were indicted on criminal fraud charges.<br />Messrs.

      <td>Rather than reopen classrooms, the new president coasts on his predecessor’s work.</td>
      <td>Handling a pandemic is hard work. Lucky for Joe Biden, he’s discovering his predecessor did most of the heavy lifting.<br />Mr. Biden ran on two big promises. One was national unity, which he has redefined as Republicans agreeing to his agenda. The other was to “get control of the virus that’s ruined so many lives”—enabled, he says, by the Trump administration and “the worst performance of any nation on earth.” He would do this by “finally” imposing “a plan” to get the economy running, schools open, vaccines distributed.<br />The new administration has spent every minute talking coronavirus. Yet 90% of its energy has gone to trashing its predecessor and resetting expectations, not to any sweeping policy change. Logistically, it would seem Mr. Biden inherited a fine plan after all. In the few areas where he might actually force improvement—notably reopening schools—the president has whiffed.<br />On the top priorities, vaccine production and distribution, Mr. Biden continues to pretend he had to start from scratch. This week he accused the Trump administration of misleading his team about the amount of “vaccine available.” How so? The prior administration started placing bets on vaccine candidates last summer, helping companies manufacture them before clinical trials were complete. By December, two vaccines, from  Pfizer  and Moderna, had panned out, and officials had announced that a total of 400 million doses would be delivered by summer.<br />The Biden administration has made little change to the vaccine-production plan; there’s nothing much to be done. It made hay of its early decision to order 200 million more doses. But the deal won’t accelerate the pace of production and may prove unnecessary as other vaccines become available sooner. The administration also crowed that it is invoking the Defense Production Act, ordering suppliers to prioritize Pfizer’s demand for raw materials. A good sound bite, though unnecessary. The Trump administration already provided Pfizer priority with a deal in December.</td>

      <td>An attack on wines from Australia is an attack on democracy.</td>
      <td>If you want to drink a toast to freedom, consider an Australian wine. China has taken umbrage at Australia’s criticism of its human-rights record and slammed tariffs on its wines. Among other outrageous demands, Beijing insists that Australia rein in its free press’s coverage of China.<br />Australia isn’t alone. China has sought to scare off other democracies from criticizing its regime. “If they dare to harm China’s sovereignty, security and development interests, they should beware of their eyes being poked and blinded,” a Beijing spokesman said in November.<br />These bullying tactics were honed over the past decade by threatening trade repercussions for democratic leaders (including two Danish prime ministers under whom I am proud to have served) who met with the Dalai Lama. Granting the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo put Norwegian salmon out of the China market for years. China is holding two innocent Canadians hostage as political blackmail for Canada’s following up on a U.S. extradition claim on Huawei’s chief financial officer.<br />China isn’t alone. Russia has used economic blackmail for many years, not least with its regular threats to block gas flows to Eastern Europe during wintertime. The European Union took steps to counter that blackmail through legislation and investment that empowers all EU states to act in solidarity, reverse their gas flows, and speak with one voice through the EU in negotiating gas deals.<br />There’s a lesson here: We don’t have to allow autocracies to pick off democracies one by one. The free world can and should do more, by agreeing to an “economic Article 5”—similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s Article 5, which states that a military attack on one ally is considered an attack on all.</td>

      <td>From Somali Xawaash to Indian chaat masala, American cooks are embracing new combinations of aromas and flavors.</td>
      <td>When my mood turns anxious or just weary of these pandemic times, I lift my heavy granite mortar and pestle down from its shelf and grind up a new spice mix. It’s more exhilarating than a new bottle of perfume and far cheaper. It never ceases to amaze me how the whole atmosphere in the kitchen changes depending on subtle tweaks to the spice mix. Grind together some cinnamon sticks and cardamom pods and your kitchen will instantly smell of Swedish sticky buns; add a spoonful of cumin to the mix and you are eating pilaf in the Middle East. Spice mixes allow you to travel the world in an aromatic haze, which is all the more welcome now that real travel is mostly off the table.<br />One of my current favorite spice mixes is a Somali one from “In Bibi’s Kitchen: The Recipes and Stories of Grandmothers From the Eight African Countries that Touch the Indian Ocean” by Hawa Hassan with Julia Turshen, published last year. Hawa Hassan was born in Somalia, and she includes a recipe for something called Xawaash spice mix (pronounced HA-wash), which can be used for anything from pilaf to stew to roasted vegetables.<br /><br />Ms. Hassan says that every Somali cook will have their own family recipe for it. The version in the book has a sharp bite from bold quantities of black peppercorns and a warm citrusy fragrance from coriander seeds, cumin, cardamom, cinnamon stick and whole cloves. I used the spice mix to make Ms. Hassan’s recipe for chicken stew with yogurt and coconut. As we ate it, our mouths tingled to taste a dinner seasoned with a fresh perfume—fresh to us, at least, if not to millions of Somali cooks and eaters.<br />One of the untold stories of modern food is that we tend to eat so many more spices than in the past. The value of U.S. spice imports rose from $426 million in 1998 to $597 million in 2007, according to the USDA. The spice aisle of the American supermarket, with its jars of Middle Eastern za’atar and Japanese shichimi, is unrecognizable next to its equivalent a few decades ago. Garam masala from India and Chinese five-spice are now almost as easy to source as salt and pepper.</td>

      <td>A PBS ‘American Experience’ special looks at the life of contralto Marian Anderson, the first African-American soloist at the Met Opera.</td>
      <td>‘Do I still have to go through with this?” the opera singer Marian Anderson asked her manager, Sol Hurok, on the evening of April 8, 1939—the night before her now-legendary appearance at the Lincoln Memorial. A case of nerves would have been understandable, even for a seasoned performer like Anderson. But as recalled in the “American Experience” installment “Voice of Freedom,” she also knew the event was going to define her forever—just as it would define the Daughters of the American Revolution, the organization that had barred the singer from Washington’s Constitution Hall because of her race and precipitated a watershed moment in the history of the American Civil Rights movement.<br />The best moments of “Voice of Freedom” are Anderson’s—the deep throb of her contralto, the images of her performance on that Easter Sunday, warily waiting to sing for the integrated thousands jammed onto the National Mall. It is footage we have seen many times, often in short takes meant to punctuate stories about the Black experience. But seen at length it is gloriously rich, historically resonant and maybe even a little bit haunted. Whatever the filmmakers, including director Rob Rapley, did to the old film, it takes on a new life.<br />But “Voice of Freedom” isn’t just about the concert, or even about Anderson herself—her childhood of struggle; her humiliating, race-based rejection by the Philadelphia Music Academy; a Town Hall performance in New York so disastrous it might have derailed her. Or the career she enjoyed in Europe that she could never have had at home, where she remained a second-class citizen regardless of her celebrity and her talent.<br />“What I heard today one is privileged to hear only once in 100 years,” Arturo Toscanini had told the singer, after the devoutly antifascist conductor attended an Anderson performance in Salzburg, Austria, around the same time Nazis started making even the streets there perilous for people of color. Thereafter, she would be known as the “Voice of the Century,” though she would not give a dramatic, costumed performance until she broke the color barrier at the Metropolitan Opera in 1955 (in Verdi’s “Un ballo in maschera”).<br />“Voice of Freedom” is also about America in the Jim Crow era and, to an illuminating extent, about the Lincoln Memorial. The neoclassical temple had been dedicated just 17 years earlier, in 1922, in a segregated ceremony. Walter White, the executive director of the NAACP, responded by moving the Howard University-sponsored concert from verboten Constitution Hall to the memorial, making it both free and broadcast nationally—a strategy meant not just as a slap to the DAR but as a way of re-dedicating the memorial in the spirit of Lincoln. To do so he had to enlist the aid of not just first lady Eleanor Roosevelt—whose resignation from the DAR gave the event further gravitas—but also Harold Ickes, the secretary of the interior. For his part, President Franklin Roosevelt said “She can sing from the top of the Washington Monument if she wants to.”</td>

      <td>Like the 2010 ‘flash crash,’ the media overreaction will probably produce a government overreaction.</td>
      <td>Things aren’t looking good for those of us who hoped the  GameStop  frenzy would quickly give way to GameStop fatigue.<br />We have seen pretty much every take imaginable—about hedge-fund managers, trading apps and lonely men in their basements. Politicians are calling for investigations by congressional committees and regulators. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reportedly convened a meeting to discuss the matter with the leaders of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Reserve. The Journal reported on Thursday that the Justice Department—including prosecutors from the office where I used to work—has opened a criminal investigation into potential market manipulation. The CFTC has opened a parallel civil investigation and the SEC has begun reviewing social media and Reddit posts possibly intended to inflate GameStop’s stock price, potentially as part of a “pump and dump” scheme.<br />The frenzy recalls the intense media coverage of the so-called flash crash on May 6, 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered a precipitous 30-minute drop that briefly wiped out roughly a trillion dollars in value. The Washington Post invoked the episode as a cautionary tale. Politico similarly noted that GameStop “may trigger the most political attention to the mechanics of stock trading since the 2010 ‘flash crash.’ ”<br />This is probably true, but not in a way that is heartening. The U.S. government’s haphazard and deeply confused response to the flash crash—the effects of which remain with us to this day—should serve as a warning about the risks of overreaction to what should be a niche market story.<br />Like GameStop, the flash crash prompted commentary and media attention across ideological lines, as well as calls for congressional hearings and government interventions. We learned months later from the SEC and CFTC—in what remains the best account of the episode—that the cause was likely a poorly placed order from a large fund that happened to coincide with unusual market conditions.</td>

      <td>The FDA has approved only a few therapeutic drugs. Many studies suggest promising options.</td>
      <td>New Covid-19 variants are eluding antibody treatments and may render vaccines less effective. To keep up, physicians need a broader arsenal of therapies that the virus can’t easily defeat. But the Food and Drug Administration has authorized precious few treatments for Covid-19, namely Gilead’s antiviral remdesivir and monoclonal antibodies by  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  and  Eli Lilly .  The National Institutes of Health has prioritized monoclonal antibodies—essentially manufactured copies of human antibodies—which have shown promise against other diseases, including cancer.<br />The rub is that mutations that alter the shape of the spike protein on the surface of the virus—as variants from the U.K., Brazil and South Africa do—can deform the sites to which antibodies bind before they neutralize the virus. Developing new antibody cocktails that target new variants could become a game of Whac-A-Mole.<br />The good news is that Gilead says remdesivir appears effective against the new strains. It is the only FDA-approved antiviral for Covid-19, and the five-day infusion treatment is limited to hospital patients. Antivirals, which stop viruses from replicating in human cells, are typically most effective early in an illness. So finding other effective antivirals, especially ones that can be prescribed to outpatients, should be a priority.<br />Antivirals can gum up virus replication in myriad ways. Remdesivir creates a paper jam in the coronavirus’s copy machine so it can’t distribute copies of its genetic code. Scientists at the University of Texas last month published a study in the journal Molecular Cell in which they identified the key mechanism remdesivir uses to inhibit the virus’s replication. That could lead to the creation of more potent and perhaps ingestible drugs.<br />“What if you could take just one pill and that was all you needed to do?” as study co-author Kenneth Johnson was quoted in a UT press release. “That would make a huge difference in terms of the here and now.”</td>

      <td>Shaka King’s thrilling biopic stars Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield as Fred Hampton and the FBI informant who turned on him.</td>
      <td>Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield give a matched pair of phenomenal performances in “Judas and the Black Messiah.” Mr. Kaluuya is Fred Hampton, the controversial chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party in the late 1960s, and Mr. Stanfield is Bill O’Neal, the FBI informant who was instrumental in Hampton’s killing. The film, directed by Shaka King from a script he wrote with Will Berson, is a special sort of twofer—a powerful, and candidly sympathetic, political biography with contemporary relevance, and a morality tale set forth as an exciting action adventure. (The film is playing in theaters and streaming on HBO Max.)<br />It’s impossible to say which of the two characters is dominant. Hampton is prodigiously energetic, violent on occasion and formidably persuasive, a gifted orator who speaks at the velocity of an auctioneer—I won’t pretend I was always able to keep up—and moves his audiences with denunciations of racial injustice and promises of progress through revolutionary action. Hampton was, remarkably, only 21 when he died following an armed pre-dawn raid on his apartment. Mr. Kaluuya is not 21, and he’s English, not American, a source of concern in some circles. Yet the sheer brilliance of his portrayal sweeps away all questions except how in the world he put such a performance together. (We see Hampton listening to the speeches of Martin Luther King Jr., not only for their content but their magisterial cadences. We’re told that Mr. Kaluuya, in his turn, worked with an opera coach as part of his preparation for the role’s hurtling dialogue.)<br />The Judas of the piece, O’Neal, died in 1990; his death was ruled a suicide. In the film’s interpretation, O’Neal is a dunce politically, before and well after he meets Hampton, serves him as a Black Panther security captain and betrays him. A career car thief before infiltrating the Panthers, he had a fondness, grounded in fact, for impersonating an FBI agent, then appropriating car keys from supposed suspects. (In one of the film’s many gripping moments, a couple of Hampton’s lieutenants test O’Neal’s veracity by making him prove that he knows how to hot-wire a car.)<br />Mr. Stanfield’s quiet triumph—you won’t understand the quietude until you see it—lies in making O’Neal affecting, even fascinating, as well as unprincipled and contemptible. He’s a melancholy rat, trapped by his alliance with the FBI. You can almost see the workings of his mind as he tries frantically to grasp the magnitude of what he has signed up for. He lacks the privilege and education of Clerici, the Fascist assassin in Bernardo Bertolucci’s peerless “The Conformist,” but both men share a spiritual emptiness that can’t be filled.<br />The production surrounds its two stars with splendid actors in smaller roles. Jesse Plemons is Roy Mitchell, O’Neal’s FBI handler, a pleasant man perfectly comfortable with putting evil deeds in motion. (The film is unsparing in its depiction of a lawless FBI.) Martin Sheen is unrecognizable, and chilling, as J. Edgar Hoover, famously fearful of the rise of a Black messiah and obsessed with Hampton as the candidate at hand. Dominique Fishback plays Deborah Johnson, Hampton’s girlfriend. Ms. Fishback is appealing, in a conventional way, until she becomes absolutely enchanting in a breathtaking scene that lasts almost three minutes. That’s when Deborah, pregnant with Hampton’s child, pleads her case, with an eloquence equal to his, that life should be more than ceaseless war in the name of social justice.</td>

      <td>Patrick Page stars in a one-man show about Shakespeare’s villains; a woman undergoes surgery to restore her sight in Brian Friel’s play.</td>
      <td>On Broadway, Patrick Page usually plays bad guys, most notably the monstrous villains of “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” and “Hadestown.” Elsewhere, though, he is best known as one of America’s greatest classical actors, blessed with a bass voice so resonant that it can actually make your theater seat shake—I’ve felt it—without benefit of amplification.<br />To capture such a force of nature on a screen is no small trick, but “All the Devils Are Here: How Shakespeare Invented the Villain,” a solo show written and performed by Mr. Page and produced by Washington’s Shakespeare Theatre Company, does the job with seeming ease. Not only does it clearly convey the immense force of his stage presence, but it is also an illuminating introduction to an insufficiently appreciated aspect of Shakespeare’s genius. As Mr. Page says at the outset, “Shakespeare’s two-decade exploration of evil actually made him a more humane and sophisticated writer. In creating an entirely new kind of villain, Shakespeare rejected the prejudices of his age and became a writer for all of us.”<br />Part of what makes “All the Devils Are Here” so accessible is that Mr. Page addresses himself to the home viewer, speaking in a conversational, almost chatty way (“Do you believe in evil spirits? Do you believe in evil?”) and pointing out Shakespeare’s influence on such TV shows as “Breaking Bad” and “House of Cards.” His intended audience is clearly people who like Shakespeare but don’t necessarily know much of anything about him. But when he gets down to business and takes an 80-minute stroll through the rogue’s gallery, he sheds his populist manner like a coat and introduces us to, among others, Richard III (played with a hair-raising smile so horrific that you half expect to see fangs), Iago (whom he plays as a sociopath hiding behind the mask of sanity), Macbeth and his bloodthirsty lady, the vengeful Hamlet and Malvolio, and—yes—even Sir John Falstaff.<br />Along the way, we meet Shylock, whom Mr. Page enacts without a trace of caricature and about whose characterization he speaks with singular penetration: “Shylock is the villain of the play—but for the first time in history, he’s a villain whose motivation is so clear, whose psychology is so complex and whose language is so rich and idiosyncratic that he changes the way we experience villainy itself. Shakespeare forces us to ask ourselves: If we had been treated as Shylock was treated, might we find the same depths of wickedness in ourselves? Could we be evil?”<br />Mr. Page has no fear of the grand gesture, and here as in his stage work, his motto might well be “Go big or go home.” But what is in certain ways most remarkable about his filmed performance is that it never feels at all overdrawn. I confess to wishing that I had been listening on a sound system equipped with a subwoofer, but even on earphones you will relish his organ-pipe voice, and his physical presence all but leaps out of the screen and seizes you by the throat. Appropriately enough, he is dressed in black from top to toe, and the set on which he performs is no less uncluttered: a rug, a desk, two chairs and a coat rack. He has been very well directed for film by Alan Paul and photographed with smooth, flowing simplicity by Joey Ruffini (whose tight closeups are especially striking).</td>

      <td>Lee Isaac Chung’s semi-autobiographical film tells the story of a Korean family relocating to a farm in Arkansas.</td>
      <td><br />The most efficient review of “Minari” would be something along the lines of “It’s wonderful. See it. You’ll love it.” But you need to know more than that about Lee Isaac Chung’s partly autobiographical drama, in which a Korean family settles in Arkansas in the 1980s. This heartfelt, heart-filling celebration of putting down roots—the title refers to a resilient Korean variety of watercress—calls for gratitude and wonderment at how such an outwardly straightforward story could be so intimate, poignant, improbably funny and steadfastly stirring.<br />One clue may involve the film’s deep roots in a classic genre—all those movies and TV shows about immigrants, homegrown pioneers or impoverished Okies confronting harsh new environments where disaster can strike in the form of illness, prejudice, a tornado or a drought. Yet there’s no overt harshness here. The rural Arkansas of “Minari” seems downright congenial, at least to the paterfamilias of the piece, Jacob Yi (Steven Yeun). A chronic optimist, he has brought his wife, Monica (Yeri Han); their daughter, Anne (Noel Kate Cho); and their enchantingly quirky little son, David (Alan Kim), all the way from California, hoping for a desperately needed fresh start. (The film is playing in select theaters nationwide and will start streaming on demand on Feb. 26.)<br />Jacob’s plan seems sound enough. On a plot of land he calls “the best dirt in America,” he’ll grow Korean vegetables for increasing numbers of his compatriots coming to big cities in neighboring states. Meanwhile, he and Monica will put food on their own table with money they make sexing chicks at a nearby hatchery. We learn a lot about sexing chicks from this movie. It’s a dreary job, and the one that Jacob and Monica, born and married in Korea, had been doing in California for a dead-end decade. He’s a speedy wizard at it while she works more slowly, although, he assures her, she’s fast enough for Arkansas.<br />Whether she’s a comfortable fit for Arkansas is another matter. She is appalled by the mobile home Jacob has bought for them to live in. (Their daughter is intrigued. “Wheels!” Anne says, checking out the underpinnings.) And Monica fears the isolation—living on their own in the middle of nowhere, and far from a hospital they might need if David’s heart condition takes a turn for the worse. (“Don’t run, David,” his mother calls whenever he does, which is often.)</td>

London and Beijing have criticized each other’s action as hurting media freedom, depicting the news organizations involved as extensions of each government’s agenda.<br />In the mainland, China’s announcement by the National Radio and Television Administration just past midnight Friday, at the start of the Lunar New Year holiday, appeared mostly symbolic since international broadcasters such as the BBC already have extremely limited reach there. The programming typically can only be seen in upmarket hotels and compounds where foreigners live, and even on those feeds the screens frequently go black when news relates to China.<br />While the Chinese announcement ordered the BBC off the airways in Chinese territory, it wasn’t immediately clear how the ban, set to last at least a year, would affect BBC services in Hong Kong, which has a freer media environment, though Beijing has expanded limits on journalism there.<br />BBC television news remained on the air in Hong Kong early Friday.

      <td>In the actor’s CNN docuseries, he takes viewers on a delectable food tour featuring local pastas, cheeses and more.</td>
      <td>If you wanted to prepare a Stanley Tucci reduction—a distillation of the actor’s basic essence—you might be left with a single, ironically cocked eyebrow. He is not a performer given to grand gestures. So when he tastes the yolk-fattened spaghetti carbonara in a Roman restaurant, closes both eyes and spontaneously hugs the chef, it is the equivalent of fireworks over the Tiber.<br />“Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy” contains a number of such moments and more than a few “oh my gods!’’ as Mr. Tucci zigzags from region to region, sampling the best of Italian cooking, and Italian chefs, and no doubt tantalizing his audience: Few people are traveling for pleasure right now, and the scope of one’s culinary explorations are largely contained by the borders of the Seamless empire. So while much pleasure can be derived from Mr. Tucci’s food tour, some sour grapes may be on the menu, too.<br />The visuals more than compensate. Shot during a “brief moment of normality” during the pandemic, the six-part series follows the actor around the country of his ancestors, tasting local dishes and reflecting on their origins and history. This is not a new approach to either food or travel TV—Rick Steves, for example, can be seen most nights on PBS offering the same species of programming. But with Mr. Tucci a viewer doesn’t feel he or she is being sold anything. The pizza of Naples, the pasta Amatriciana of Rome, the panzanella of Florence (where “old bread would choose to die,” Mr. Tucci says) sell themselves. The show’s host is our fluent Virgil on a tour of gustatory paradiso.<br />In addition to the vicarious pleasure to be had in someone else’s cacio e pepe, nuggets of history are scattered throughout the series like so many garlic croutons. The story of Naples, for instance, Mr. Tucci’s first stop, combines “two of Italy’s favorite subjects: food and death.” Not only has the unpredictable Vesuvius always haunted Neapolitans, but cholera has been a historic threat in a city of overcrowding and inadequate sanitation. As a precaution, even bread was once fried to avert contagion, and the earliest pizza—which will have viewers salivating—was what Americans think of now as a calzone: a pastry pocket filled with ricotta, pork fat, smoked cheese and basil, deep-fried to the point of plague-free perfection.<br />Pizza is the preoccupation of the Naples episode, which includes a visit with Michelin-rated pizzaioloEnzo Coccia, who walks Mr. Tucci through the making of a perfect pie—the wheat; the buffalo that provide the mozzarella; and the San Marzano tomato, the genuine version of which, we learn, are grown on fewer than 400 acres of soil enriched by Vesuvian ash. In Rome, the focus is elsewhere. “If you’re on a low-carb diet, beware,” Mr. Tucci says. “You’re going to see a lot of pasta. I mean like a lot of pasta. Like a lot.”</td>

They said that before his  Facebook  page was deleted he posted conspiracy theories there about vaccines and QAnon, and engaged with people in heated online debates.<br />Affidavits for the arrest of the five people said they marched as a group with other known members of the Proud Boys, which describes itself as an organization for “Western chauvinists.” Several of those members have been previously arrested on similar charges, and, according to the affidavits, worked to prevent law enforcement from securing the area.<br />Since the riot on Jan. 6, more than 200 participants have been arrested on charges ranging from unlawful entry of a restricted building to assaulting federal officers. Prosecutors have also focused more specifically on alleged members of the Proud Boys and several militia groups including the Oath Keepers, building cases that accuse small subsets of the larger group of rioters of coordinating their actions and planning the assault in advance.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal deficits are projected to soar over the next decade,  but not as much as officials forecast last summer, thanks to an improving economic outlook that is expected to bolster federal revenues, the Congressional Budget Office said Thursday.<br />Federal debt, which reached 100% of gross domestic product in the last fiscal year, is expected to rise to a record 107% of economic output by 2031.<br />The agency expects cumulative deficits over the next 10 years will total $12.6 trillion, 3% less than projected in September, the last time the agency released its estimates. The decline stems from stronger-than-expected economic activity, higher inflation and higher interest rates, which will boost federal tax revenue more than spending, the nonpartisan agency said.<br />Republicans in Congress who object to President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package have pointed to growing budget deficits and debt as a reason to keep spending in check. They also argue the economy is already poised for stronger growth this year. Democrats, who control the House and Senate with narrow majorities, are on track to approve the bill.<br />Financial markets have shown little concern about the deficit, as inflation stays low and investors around the world seek the safety of U.S. Treasury securities. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 1.133% on Wednesday following a report that consumer price increases remain limited.</td>

As Daimler-Benz’s director of motorsports, Neubauer (1891-1980) presided over two generations of all-conquering racers: the Silver Arrows of 1934-1939 and the 300 SLs, circa 1952-1955. The last time Neubauer saw such a grille, it was attached to the winner of the 1952 Carrera Panamericana Mexico, a sleek, masculine endurance machine. Here it is not. So not.<br />What say you, Herr Neubauer? Can design history be misquoted, or at least taken out of context? And would you please not drink all my liquor?<br />Introduced last year, the GLB compact SUV is a new body style for  Mercedes-Benz  and it is rather determinedly unsleek. The largest crossover among the vehicles built on Mercedes’s CLA architecture, the GLB casts about the same size shadow as an Audi Q5 or Land Rover Discovery Sport, but its volumes and proportions are more like a Mini Countryman scaled at 105%. Please note the more upright windscreen angle, lower sill line, level roof line, taller sections of glass, more prominent lower cladding and hatch-ier hatch, compared to most of the GLB’s siblings. This more forthright squareness is emphasized by brightwork window trim.<br />Speaking of alternative timelines, our black-on-black test car looked like a London taxi if Germany had won the war, a la “The Man in the High Castle.”</td>

Many opted for other less costly educational opportunities, chose to go to work over attending college, worked while attending college, saved before attending college or chose degrees capable of providing income sufficient to repay their loans. Many brave men and women joined our armed forces and risked their lives to be provided an avenue to attend college when they completed their military service. By increasing the tax burden necessary to pay for debt cancellation, entitled individuals would prevent a whole other segment of our society from “buying cars, from going on vacation, from starting families.”<br />Maybe the colleges with the multimillion-dollar endowment funds that are benefiting from these overpriced educations should be on the hook for the forgiveness of the debt and not the U.S. taxpayer.<br />Patrick Demetruk<br />Stephenville, Texas<br /></td>

If strains emerge in the unvaccinated that have evolved to evade developed immunity, the entire global program of vaccination will have been neutered and we’ll need to develop new vaccines to counter the new threat, while the virus continues to evolve, unchecked in the unvaccinated, previously vaccinated and previously infected.<br />People concerned for older family members and sick family and friends need to seriously consider that their loved ones’ developed immunity from vaccination can be neutralized by viruses evolved in the young who see no personal protective effect in a vaccine.<br />The life we save by getting vaccinated might be a loved one’s.<br />Gerard M.

Prosecutors have subpoenaed information from brokers such as Robinhood Markets Inc., the popular online brokerage that many individual investors used to trade GameStop and other shares, the people said.<br />GameStop shares surged from about $20 to $483 over a period of two weeks in January. The stock has since fallen to around $50. It was fueled by an army of bullish individual traders exhorting one another on Reddit to buy the shares and squeeze hedge funds that bet the price would fall. Traders who bet stock prices will decline are known as short sellers.<br />In addition to the probe by the Justice Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is examining similar trading, the people said. The CFTC has opened a preliminary investigation into whether misconduct occurred as some Reddit traders targeted silver futures and the largest exchange-traded fund tied to silver, the  iShares Silver Trust ,  one of the people said.<br />The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the trading frenzy as well. The SEC and CFTC are civil regulators. The burden of proof in a regulatory enforcement action is lower than in a criminal case.</td>

      <td>Today’s often toxic social-media environment calls for a fix that puts choices back in the hands of consumers. A new layer of ‘middleware’ can do that.</td>
      <td>Twitter ’s  decision to kick Donald Trump off its platform was welcomed by many liberals as a necessary response to a president who had incited the January 6 storming of Congress. But many of those not particularly friendly to Mr. Trump were nonetheless troubled that Twitter had grown so powerful that it could silence a U.S. president. The Russian anticorruption activist Alexei Navalny, in a series of tweets a few days before his recent arrest, expressed similar worries about Twitter using its power against champions of democracy.<br />The prevailing approach to protecting political speech on the major digital platforms has been to pressure the companies to self-regulate by creating, for instance, oversight boards of outside experts. But leaving these momentous decisions in the hands of private companies is not a long-term solution; they have neither the legitimacy nor the capacity to make such decisions in the public interest.<br />The core issue is the oversize power of Twitter,  Facebook  and Google in controlling political discourse. One measure with some congressional support is to repeal or change Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which limits the liability of platforms for the content they carry. But reform could hurt small companies more than the established giants, who can more easily develop algorithms and hire personnel to filter out problematic content.<br />The question is how to reduce the power of today’s digital monopolists without losing the substantial social value they offer. We believe that a structural solution is possible: requiring the dominant platforms to allow users to select their own output from the algorithms. This would depend on the creation of a new kind of “middleware.” The term normally refers to software that connects operating systems with applications, but we envision software that puts a filtering layer between big platforms and their users. It would give consumers a simple, powerful tool to manage the content that reaches them.<br />The problem with today’s digital monopolists is not that they carry fake news or conspiracy theories; this content is unfortunately widespread, and the First Amendment protects Americans’ right to express what they want. The real harm comes from those few companies’ ability to amplify certain voices while excluding others. This power is a product of scale economies, in which one large platform generates more attention, participation and value than multiple smaller ones, and a business model that relies on capturing user attention for advertisers. These platforms squeeze out alternative platforms while fueling virality, thereby advancing the loudest, most provocative voices.</td>

      <td>In the past sommeliers have guided wine drinkers to grower Champagnes—idiosyncratic, expressive, the antithesis of anodyne big brands. This year tracking them down might be a labor of love, but special bottles and great values await the tenacious.</td>
      <td>OF ALL THE clever wine terms coined over the years, “farmer fizz” may be my favorite. Credited to Champagne importer Terry Theise, it’s a term that retailers and sommeliers have happily adopted. And why not? Fizz from a farmer sounds like something friendly and fun, a down-to-earth drink quite unlike an elitist bottle from a big Champagne house.<br />Farmer fizz is Champagne made by grape growers who choose not to sell all their fruit to the big houses. Though some growers have always made their own wines, only in the past few decades has it become commonplace. Thanks to the importers and sommeliers who championed the wines stateside, farmer fizz, aka grower Champagne, has gained a devoted following in the past 20 years.<br />Last year, world-wide sales of Champagne were down by 18% compared with the previous year according to the trade organization Comité Champagne. The closure of many restaurants was doubtless a factor: Sommeliers have always played a key role in guiding drinkers to the wines. Still, some growers actually did very well in 2020—even reporting record sales.<br />According to Gabriel Clary, Champagne portfolio manager of Skurnik Wines & Spirits in Manhattan, Champagnes from established growers saw an uptick in sales thanks to wine merchants who purchased large quantities. Champagnes from less-established growers haven’t fared as well, he noted.<br />The Skurnik Champagne portfolio includes the selection of grower Champagnes once curated by Mr. Theise, whose 20-plus-year partnership with Skurnik ended early last year. Mr. Theise credits sommeliers with playing a key role in the success of the wines, and one of his most successful sales tools was his annual Champagne catalog, an education on the region, its growers and their wines. His frequently flamboyant prose inspired many in the business. “He wrote the stories of farmers so beautifully, and story is such an important part of grower Champagne,” said Jason Jacobeit, wine director of Bâtard restaurant in Manhattan (currently closed), as well as owner and managing partner of Somm Cellars Wine & Spirits, where he stocks a wide selection of grower Champagnes. He discovered many of them as a sommelier, thanks to Mr. Theise.</td>

Its Bing search engine lags behind Google in market share. Microsoft has urged governments to better regulate facial-recognition technology and last year sided with a videogame developer against  Apple Inc.  in a dispute about app-store fees.<br />The Australian proposal, if enacted into law—it is now before a parliamentary committee—could prompt other countries to follow suit in a global transformation of the relationship between tech companies and traditional media.<br />Some countries, particularly in Europe, have tried to force tech companies to pay publishers, often with little success. Australia’s effort gained momentum last year, when the pandemic-driven downturn further strained the finances of media companies.<br />“The United States should not object to a creative Australian proposal that strengthens democracy by requiring tech companies to support a free press,” Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post published Thursday. “It should copy it instead.”</td>

But when it comes to the constitutional right to worship, California began to follow the science only after a recent Supreme Court intervention.<br />Political elites issuing health orders that they themselves don’t obey—and destroying countless livelihoods without any scientific basis for such action—is infuriating. But it was especially so for us Catholics, who have scientific evidence that positively demonstrates we can celebrate Mass safely indoors. In lifting California’s blanket ban on indoor worship, the high court rightly acknowledged the blatant unfairness of treating religious worship differently from secular activities such as shopping.<br />It’s been a long fight. Even as the pandemic subsided last summer and secular businesses began to open up, we still had to fight San Francisco City Hall for our right to worship. At the time the local government’s health orders were even more severe than California’s statewide policies. For months, San Francisco banned outdoor gatherings of more than 12 people—even as street protests were conveniently allowed and some city officials even participated.<br />After numerous attempts at respectful dialogue with the pertinent city officials went nowhere, my patience finally wore out. I began to criticize City Hall publicly and gather groups for multiple simultaneous outdoor Masses. In September, the city raised the numerical limit for outdoor gatherings but issued a ruling that only one person at a time would be allowed in a church for private prayer. That prompted a warning letter from the U.S. Justice Department calling on the city to “immediately equalize its treatment of places of worship to comply with the First Amendment.”<br />The issue became more intense as Christmas approached. We were already locked out of our churches for Easter, and I could not stomach this happening again. On Dec. 18 I sent my priests a memo giving them permission to bring the congregation indoors if weather or safety required it. The church could be filled only to 20% capacity—then the rule for indoor retail—and strict safety protocols had to be followed: masks, social distancing, sanitation and ventilation. The state health order did not follow the science, and I knew my people had to have access to the Eucharist, rain or shine. Like all the sacraments, it cannot be livestreamed. By mid-January several parishes had begun receiving ominous warnings from government officials, and two were officially cited for violations by the city Department of Public Health.</td>

      <td>Many Arab Israelis remain opposed to the prime minister, but some say they are willing to listen if he can help them tackle poverty and other problems</td>
      <td>QALANSUWA, Israel—After years of alienating Israel’s Arab voters, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now courting them, hoping they hold the key to staying in power.<br />Mr. Netanyahu has long campaigned against Israel’s Arab citizens, who make up about 20% of the country’s population, accusing their leaders of supporting terror and warning that their increased voting power could drive his right-wing government from power. In 2019, analysts and Arab voters accused his party of trying to suppress Arab votes by installing cameras in polling places.<br />Now, ahead of the March 23 national elections, Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving leader, hopes Arab Israeli votes could boost his party enough to help him form a government. He and his political allies are seeking to exploit discontent among Arabs with their own leadership, while offering the promise of a bigger role in government to address deepening problems of crime and poverty.<br />But Mr. Netanyahu faces skepticism and even hostility from many Arab Israelis over his about-face.<br />“Netanyahu is a big liar, he sees us as subjects and not citizens. He does not have enough Jews—so he came to play us, the Arabs,” said Ayman Odeh, chairman of the Joint List, a group of political parties largely representing the country’s Arab population, in an interview with Israel’s Army Radio. During a campaign stop in Nazareth in January, protesters, some waving Palestinian flags, accused Mr. Netanyahu of trying to split the Arab community and peel off some of its votes.</td>

      <td>Last fall, the paparazzi snapped the actor in a cashmere flannel with mega-checks that cost around $2,000—and the shirt went viral. Equally arresting but less paralyzingly priced: these five cotton options.</td>
      <td>IT WAS THE flannel that shot across the internet. In mid-November, actor, producer and perennial hair icon Brad Pitt was handing out groceries in Los Angeles as a charitable gesture in the lead-up to Thanksgiving. The paparazzi on hand captured Mr. Pitt’s charmingly casual outfit: a pair of white slip-on sneakers, distressed (but likely pricy) blue jeans and a flannel shirt with an unusually intense red, black and white check pattern. That beguiling flannel stole the show and fans raced to identify it. Though they floated many theories online, few picked the right brand: A representative for Mr. Pitt confirmed that the shirt is by God’s True Cashmere, a minuscule shirt company run by holistic healer and jewelry designer Sat Hari Khalsa, whose cashmere flannels can be had for around $2,000.<br />Even in the grainy, zoomed-in photographs that colonized the internet, it was possible to decipher what made Mr. Pitt’s shirt special, apart from its breathtaking price. The flannel itself was far hardier than the wafery material you usually find at shops like the Gap or Uniqlo. And its tri-colored checks were atypically large and graphic, shot through with fine, dotted lines.<br />The pattern’s blown-out scale is what takes this flannel from a simple shirt to a sensation. Dan Snyder, the owner of Corridor, a Brooklyn-based clothing label, described the print as a “macro” plaid: It’s as if a plaid pattern were viewed under a microscope and then a shirtmaker transferred that zoomed-in perspective onto a button-up. Mr. Snyder noted that few textile manufacturers actually make such overscaled patterns today. That’s why eagle-eyed commenters online were convinced that Mr. Pitt’s flannel had to be vintage, with some specifically pointing to brands like Big Mac, a workwear label started by JC Penney in 1922.<br />A few years ago, Mr. Snyder stumbled across a shirt scrap with a similarly exploded pattern that he guessed dated to the 1930s—and he took inspiration from it for his company’s Acid Plaid shirts. These wavy flannels echo the loud nature of Mr. Pitt’s (some customers asked Mr. Snyder if the “Ocean’s Eleven” star was wearing an Acid Plaid in the celebrated photo) at a much quieter price point.<br />Other more-affordable Pitt-like plaids come from brands like Freenote, Sugar Cane and Warehouse which produce, with a very reverent touch, workwear staples evocative of decades past. Made from cotton, their burly blown-out plaids might not match the cashmere prestige of Mr. Pitt’s shirt, but at around $1,700 less, they offer savings that more than offset the trade-off.</td>

      <td>A company owned by  Apollo Global Management Inc.  is in talks to buy Ardent Health Services, according to people familiar with the matter, in a move that would add roughly 30 hospitals across six states and create an entity worth more than $10 billion including debt.<br />LifePoint Health Inc., which Apollo purchased in 2018 and has hospitals in 80 mainly rural markets, is discussing a deal to buy Ardent Health from billionaire Sam Zell’s private-equity firm Equity Group Investments, the people said. A deal could value Ardent at more than $2 billion with debt, some of the people said, adding that the closely held companies, which have been in on-and-off talks, may not reach an agreement.<br />Nashville-based Ardent operates acute-care hospitals and clinics in growing urban and suburban areas, with its biggest presence in Texas and Oklahoma. Equity Group purchased Ardent in 2015 and since then has added to its holdings and more than doubled its revenue—to $4.4 billion in 2020, according to its website.<br />Apollo took LifePoint private in November 2018 in a deal valued around $5.6 billion including debt, with a plan to merge it with existing holding RCCH HealthCare Partners and continue to buy up other Nashville-area healthcare companies. Like RCCH, LifePoint was based in Brentwood, Tenn., a Nashville suburb.<br />Should a deal be reached, it would be a significant move by LifePoint to diversify into larger hospitals and clinics in densely populated areas after focusing on rural areas, which could bring risks. But a combination is also likely to bring cost savings, mainly in the form of improved purchasing power with suppliers and streamlined management.</td>

      <td>Food companies gave reasons for optimism about packaged-food demand continuing to be strong</td>
      <td>Food companies keep indicating that their good fortune last year will extend into this one. Investors might be ready to start listening.<br />Kraft Heinz  reported solid fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. Organic sales, a key industry metric that strips out the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and currency fluctuations, rose 6% in the quarter from a year earlier, compared with analyst expectations for 4.8% growth, according to Visible Alpha. This follows growth of around 6% to 7% over each of the prior three quarters as consumers ate more at home amid the coronavirus pandemic, boosting the entire sector.<br />The company also guided for flat to positive organic sales growth in the first quarter of 2021, paired with low single-digit growth in adjusted earnings. This is notable because it is measured against an extraordinarily high base; it was in March of last year when consumers rushed to stock up their pantries. Granted, the pandemic has stretched on in January and February, keeping many out of restaurants. But the fact that the company still sees sales at a comparable level to that frantic period is significant.<br />On a conference call, company executives were cautious about giving a full-year sales forecast, citing the volatility of the pandemic situation. But Chief Financial Officer Paulo Basilio did say the company is confident that full-year financial performance will exceed what was envisioned in the company’s strategic plan unveiled in September. That plan gave no specific targets for 2021 but called for long-term annual growth of 2% to 3% in adjusted earnings.<br />Kellogg  on Thursday reported somewhat less impressive results, with organic sales rising just 2.5% year on year, compared with expectations of 4.1%. It also said that it sees full-year organic sales falling just 1% over all of 2021. Taken together, these forecasts suggest that packaged-food demand could stabilize at a high level this year, and that it certainly won’t suffer a sharp reversal.</td>

      <td>In the WFH Era, Gen Z and millennials are trading hyped-up sneakers for practical, comfortable walking shoes with an orthopedic edge</td>
      <td>ALEX WRIGHT first laid eyes on Mephisto’s stocky leather lace-ups when he was a teenager working in the back of a clothing store in Manchester, England. Someone had ordered a pair of the ample, minimalist walking shoes online and as he packed the order, Mr. Wright, now 24, thought, “Who on earth under the age of 50 would buy these shoes?” He couldn’t have predicted that just a few years later he would own not just one pair of Mephistos, but three. From his teen years to young adulthood, his taste in shoes has evolved from hyped-up sneakers to sensible, comfortable, even orthopedic-style shoes.<br />In 2021, practical walking shoes are being curiously co-opted by spry 20- and 30-somethings. What footwear falls into this category? Anything that you could pilfer from a retirement-home denizen: for example, the outdoorsy Merrell Jungle Moc with its tractioned rubber sole; Keen’s springy, elasticized Uneek sandal; and the extremely gray Journey Mesh sneaker made by 45-year-old American brand San Antonio Shoemakers, which boasts a “Tripad Technology” shock-absorbing sole.<br />Men have long sought comfort from their shoes, but the pandemic has led them to prioritize comfort over presentability or panache. When your date calendar has been wiped clean, you’re going to rely more on your mushy, errand-run Merrells than your polished Allen Edmonds loafers. “People just want to be a little bit more cozy. I think that practicality is what people are gravitating toward right now,” said Stefano Gugliotta, 29, a Florida-based social media manager for a national chain of car dealerships who also runs @obscuresneakers, an Instagram account with nearly 75,000 followers that pays homage to little-known shoes.<br />Early on, his account featured Avia high-top basketball shoes from the 1980s and long-forgotten Adidas tennis shoes, but lately he’s been mixing in images of plush Subu slip-ons, curvaceous Teva sandals and hard-to-find Oakley mules. By featuring these functional, gorpcore-ish shoes, Mr. Gugliotta is capturing a shift toward footwear that is decidedly unprecious. These are not Jordans you have to polish with a toothbrush, or Air Force Ones you’d baby so as to not crease the leather. These are practical shoes you can put through the wringer.<br />Not everyone understands why geriatric walking shoes are catching on with a more limber generation, though. Recently, Ryan Chang, 32, a writing professor in Los Angeles, went to his local SAS store to buy Journey sneakers, which look a little like New Balance shoes minus the logo. After Mr. Chang asked to try them on, the salesperson shot him what he called a “puzzled look.” Apparently, men with as few grays as he has rarely request Journeys for themselves. Regardless, Mr. Chang cherishes his new pair.</td>

But a portfolio manager who merely skims Stifel analyst Scott Devitt’s Wednesday note with a “buy” recommendation on  Uber Technologies  and a $67 price target is missing out.<br />“In our opinion, there is a lot of nonsense in financial markets at the moment. It is hard to know whether one should take much of anything seriously until this period of euphoria ends. We are analysts so it’s better to have something to recommend, even if just on a relative basis.”<br />That is hardly a typical Wall Street seal of approval. Even the math behind his target is underwhelming. Mr. Devitt notes that Uber shares trade at 33 times projected 2024 earnings. “If nothing goes wrong in the world (or at Uber) over the next three years, an investor could eke out an okay equity return, assuming current valuations hold up. If we are wrong, it’s likely to be because everything is overvalued and there will be better entry points in the future.”<br />In case that left investors who bothered to read the summary feeling uninspired, even nervous, Mr. Devitt signed off with an inspirational message: “go get em folks.”</td>

      <td>Researchers aim to measure how much immune response a shot triggers—potentially useful for assessing new shots and new uses</td>
      <td>As more Covid-19 vaccines become available in the U.S., it is getting tougher to run large clinical trials to test a new vaccine’s ability to prevent disease because people are less willing to take a placebo—forcing drugmakers and researchers to look for workarounds as they vet the next generation of shots and test new uses for authorized ones.<br />One potential workaround would be to determine what level of immune response a vaccine has to trigger to protect people from the coronavirus, as measured in blood samples, and to use that information to create smaller, faster and less-expensive clinical trials.<br />Instead of requiring tens of thousands of volunteers and costing several hundred-million dollars, such trials could involve only hundreds of people at a fraction of the cost. They could be used to speed the availability of new vaccines targeting emerging variants.<br />Moderna Inc.,   Pfizer  and its partner  BioNTech SE ,  and a federally funded network of researchers are conducting analyses to learn what immune response is necessary for protection with current vaccines, known as an immune correlate of protection. They say it could come in handy for new studies of already-authorized vaccines—such as testing the shots in children or whether reduced doses are effective—as well as for trials of the next generation of shots, including those targeting new coronavirus strains. Over time, such knowledge could also help determine how long protection from the vaccines lasts.<br />Another workaround is to run future large efficacy trials outside the U.S., in places where viral transmission is high and vaccine availability is more limited.  Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc.,  whose Covid-19 vaccine is in mid-stage testing, may run a large Phase 3 trial of its experimental shot outside the U.S. because of the diminishing feasibility of running it in the U.S., Chief Executive Joseph Payne said in an interview. The company hasn’t disclosed which country or countries.</td>

They cited the distribution of Covid-19 vaccinations and the prospect of additional fiscal relief from Washington for the brightening outlook.<br />However, they were more cautious about the recovery in jobs. Economists this month on average expected employers to add 4.8 million jobs this year, down from the 5.0 million they projected in January and equal to just half of the 9.6 million jobs lost since February 2020. The forecasters saw a mean unemployment rate of 5.3% by year’s end, about the same level they projected in last month’s survey. The Labor Department said Friday the national jobless rate was 6.3% in January.<br />“The economy is already picking up some growth momentum in the first quarter,” said Brian Bethune, professor of economics at Boston College. “The large $1.9 trillion stimulus package will provide significant insurance against a relapse into recession,” he said, referring to President Biden’s proposal.<br />More than half of the respondents said the amount of fiscal aid the economy needs to recover from the coronavirus shock was less than $1 trillion, while only one said that more than $2 trillion was required.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Congressional Democrats are using coronavirus relief legislation to advance a vision of federal aid to households that is focused on cash assistance with few restrictions, moving away from the work requirements and minimum-income thresholds that have been cornerstones of federal policies for decades.<br />The bill’s $1,400 per-person direct payments, expansion of the child tax credit and extension of unemployment insurance all would provide flexible cash to households. Democrats have emphasized the breadth of households’ needs during the pandemic and have rejected Republicans’ concerns that giving people money would discourage them from returning to work.<br />For lower-income and middle-income households, the combination of policies in the Democrats’ legislation could yield significant short-term increases in income. While unemployment benefits have an application process and eligibility restrictions, direct payments and the child tax credit expansion would have no strings attached, and they are available even to households with no income.<br />The bottom 20% of households by income would see their after-tax incomes rise by 20% because of the plan’s direct payments and tax credit expansions, according to the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. That group would get an average benefit of $2,810, while the middle 20% of households would get an average of $3,360, or 5.5% of after-tax income.<br />Higher-income households would get smaller amounts, and for now, Democrats are waiting before advancing the tax increases on top earners they promised during last year’s campaign.</td>

It could even go as high as $60,584.<br />The rate the hospital charges depends on the insurance plan covering the birth. At the bottom end of the scale is a local health plan that serves largely Medicaid recipients. At the top are prices for women whose plans don’t have the San Francisco hospital in their insurers’ network.<br />The nation’s roughly 6,000 hospitals have begun to reveal the secret rates they negotiate with insurers for a range of procedures. The data offer the first full look inside the confidential deals that set healthcare rates for insurers and employers covering more than 175 million Americans. The submissions also illuminate how widely prices vary—even for the same procedure, performed in the same facility—depending on who is paying.<br />“It is shining a light on the insanity of U.S. healthcare pricing,” said Niall Brennan, chief executive of the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes medical costs. “It’s at the center of the affordability crisis in American healthcare.”<br />Under a Trump administration rule that took effect in January, nearly all hospitals must make their prices public, a move the industry sued to block. Courts rejected hospitals’ arguments that their prices should remain under wraps. Healthcare economists say these rates are a major driver of U.S. medical costs, the highest in the world, and they are largely paid by American companies and workers.</td>

      <td>SINGAPORE—On the fifth day after Myanmar’s military chief seized power in a coup, his new foreign minister invited the diplomatic corps for a briefing via Zoom, the videoconferencing app. For Western officials, this presented a problem: Would attendance signal that they were in any way recognizing Gen. Min Aung Hlaing’s rule?<br />A flurry of discussions followed. In the end, many, including the U.S., sent deputies rather than ambassadors. Some kept their cameras off. Others expressed condemnation of the takeover, according to four diplomats with knowledge of the meeting.<br />“It was a statement—not to be there in any way to give the impression that this was OK, or that we were OK with the coup,” one of the diplomats said. “On the other hand, we want to keep diplomatic channels open.”<br />The episode captures the dilemma many in the international community face over if and how to engage with the regime of Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who last week ended Myanmar’s decadelong transition to democracy. Even before he wrested absolute control, Washington had slapped sanctions on him over alleged human-rights abuses, and his army’s brutal campaigns became the subject of a continuing genocide case at the U.N.’s top court.<br />Since the Feb. 1 coup, a number of foreign governments have tried to get him to back down. On Wednesday, President Biden said the U.S. would impose fresh sanctions against the military leadership. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke this week with officials from India and Japan, who have influence in the country, to apply pressure. New Zealand suspended all ties and declared the regime illegitimate.</td>

This time, it was former diplomat Michael Kovrig.<br />Since then, the two men have been thrust to the center of a high-stakes standoff between Canada, the U.S. and China, where they have been detained and accused of espionage. Hope had surged recently among family members and supporters that the men might be released if separate talks to resolve criminal charges against Meng Wanzhou, an executive at China’s Huawei Technologies Co., bore fruit. Canada has accused China of detaining the two men in retaliation for Ms. Meng’s arrest on a U.S. extradition request.<br />With both sides digging in on demands too far to bridge, those discussions stalled and are now dormant, according to people familiar with the matter. The Biden administration could revisit the talks in the coming months, the people said, but the timing of any such movement is unclear. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.<br />Vice President Kamala Harris told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on a phone call earlier this month that the U.S. would do everything it could to get the two men released.</td>

The forecast doesn’t factor in sales of the pandemic vaccine it developed alongside the University of Oxford.<br />Like other vaccine makers, AstraZeneca and Oxford are working on new versions of the shot to target existing and emerging variants of the coronavirus. The drugmaker said Thursday it hoped to reach production of an adapted vaccine at scale within six to nine months, using clinical-trial data and manufacturing agreements already in place.<br />Last year, AstraZeneca stumbled in communicating clinical-trial results and more recently, suffered a shortfall in doses pledged to the European Union. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot and other executives said Thursday they were working out production kinks and would meet targets to deliver more than 400 million doses to rich and poor countries in coming months. That follows green lights in the U.K., Europe and beyond for the vaccine’s use, which isn’t approved yet for U.S. use.<br />This week, the World Health Organization recommended the shot for broad global use, including in countries battling a new strain of the coronavirus first detected in South Africa. Limited trial data have suggested the vaccine is less effective against that version of the virus, though its appears to hold up against a fast-spreading variant first seen in the U.K., particularly against severe symptoms.</td>

But as prices of bitcoin and other digital assets have continued to rise, they have become more popular with asset managers, hedge funds and other institutional investors.<br />And those firms’ top executives started asking BNY Mellon and their peers to treat digital assets as they would their other holdings, Mr. Regelman said.</td>

      <td>LONDON— Royal Dutch Shell  PLC said it would start reducing oil production, calling an end to a decades-old strategy centered on pumping more hydrocarbons as it and other energy giants seek to capitalize on a shift to low-carbon power.<br />Shell said Thursday its oil production had already peaked and it expects output to decline 1-2% a year, including from asset sales, reducing its exposure to commodity prices over the longer term. At the same time, the company said it would double the amount of electricity it sells and roll out thousands of new electric-vehicle charging points.<br />The strategy follows similar plans from rivals  BP  PLC and  Total SE  to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels while expanding in renewable power such as wind and solar, partly in response to growth in regulatory and investor pressure.<br />BP plans to reduce its oil-and-gas output by 40% in the coming decade. Over the same period, Total wants to reduce its sales of oil products such as gasoline and diesel by 30%, while increasing sales of natural gas, electricity and biofuels.<br />However, the pivot is seen by analysts as challenging because it requires investments in areas where major oil companies don’t necessarily have a competitive advantage and that have lower returns. Renewables projects typically generate returns of around 10%, compared with the traditional 15% targeted on oil-and-gas projects.</td>

Once the managers finish, Mr. Trump’s legal team will have 16 hours to present his defense.<br />Some Republican senators ended Wednesday concluding that the impeachment managers, through the use of video and audio, had painted a horrifying portrait of the rioters who stormed the Capitol, but many said that they hadn’t shown that the violence was a direct result of Mr. Trump’s rhetoric. If all 50 Democrats vote to convict the former president, 17 Republicans would be needed to join them to reach the necessary two-thirds threshold.<br />The House impeached Mr. Trump last month on an article of inciting an insurrection in a 232-197 vote, with 10 Republicans joining all Democrats. So far, only six Senate Republicans have broken with their party to side with Democrats and against Mr. Trump on a key issue related to his defense: the constitutionality of trying a former president. With the Senate voting that the trial of a former president was constitutional, House managers and defense attorneys are squarely in the middle of a fight over the merits of the charge against Mr. Trump.<br />Lead impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.) and his fellow managers haven’t said what their next move is, but one option would be to use their remaining time to more fully connect the dots between Mr. Trump’s statements, tweets and speeches and the riot. So far, managers have aimed to show that Mr. Trump planned the attack by cultivating a base of people he knew to be violent, issuing a “save the date” notice through a Dec. 19 tweet calling for his supporters to “be there, will be wild,” and then timing his speech asserting that “you’ll never take back our country with weakness” to conclude just as Congress met in a joint session to certify President Biden’s Electoral College win.</td>

Weekly claims have steadily declined since early January when they exceeded 900,000. Filings remain above the pre-pandemic peak of 695,000.<br />Employers resumed hiring in January after payrolls fell at the end of 2020, and job openings picked up, driven by growth in industries that have weathered the pandemic relatively well.<br />The worst of the pandemic’s effects on the job market appear to have passed, said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies LLC.<br />“Things are really starting to improve again in the labor market,” she said.</td>

      <td>Return dates get pushed to September or beyond, keeping firms and employees in ‘moment of limbo’</td>
      <td>The hardest question to answer for American corporations: When should offices reopen?<br />From Silicon Valley to Tennessee to Pennsylvania, high hopes that a rapid vaccine rollout in early 2021 would send millions of workers back into offices by spring have been scuttled. Many companies are pushing workplace return dates to September—and beyond—or refusing to commit to specific dates, telling employees it will be a wait-and-see remote-work year.<br />The delays span industries.  Qurate Retail Inc.,  the parent company of brands such as Ballard Designs, QVC and HSN, recently shifted its planned May return to offices in the Philadelphia area, Atlanta and other cities until September at the earliest. TechnologyAdvice, a marketing firm in Nashville, initially told employees to plan on Feb. 1 as their return date. The company then pushed the date back to August. Now, TA has decided it will begin a hybrid in-office schedule in the fall of 2021, letting workers choose whether to work remotely or come in, the company says.<br />Return-to-office dates have shifted so much in the past year that some companies aren’t sharing them with employees. Shipping giant  United Parcel Service Inc.,  based in Atlanta, and financial-services firm Fidelity Investments Inc., based in Boston, haven’t announced return dates, instead telling workers signing on from home that the companies are monitoring the coronavirus pandemic and will call workers back when it is safe.<br />Nearly a year of makeshift work at home has weighed on employees, leaders say. While many companies say productivity is up, executives worry that creativity is suffering and say that burnout is on the rise. Even so, bosses struggle to say when things will change.</td>

      <td>Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco leader Mary Daly said the U.S. central bank is unlikely to pull back on its bond-buying stimulus this year, and that another round of government aid shouldn’t overheat the economy.<br />The official said she continues to expect the U.S. economy to pick up speed over the second half of the year, as vaccinations roll out and allow the economy to emerge from the shadows of the coronavirus pandemic. But even as the nation emerges from the crisis, it won’t yet be time for the central bank to pull back on its $120 billion a month in bond buying, she told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.<br />“For now, we have policy in a good place,” Ms. Daly said. “If you take the lens of my modal outlook, then it’s really continuing to purchase at the current pace through the end of this year.”<br />If the economy delivers the robust growth in the second half of the year that most central bankers expect, “then I can see the need to keep the current pace as not being as critical” starting some time next year, she said.<br />Ms. Daly was interviewed ahead of remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Fed leader also said he sees no reason for the central bank to pull back on aid for the economy, saying the asset purchases are “a key part of what we’re doing in providing overall accommodation to the economy…We’re not thinking about shrinking the balance sheet.”</td>

      <td>The global supply and demand of crude oil are on course to continue rebalancing this year after the turmoil brought by the pandemic in 2020, the International Energy Agency said Thursday.<br />Despite increasing its estimates for oil output in 2021, the IEA said in its monthly market report that a recovery in demand would outstrip production in the second half of the year, prompting “a rapid stock draw” of the glut of crude that has built up since the pandemic began.<br />The agency significantly increased its forecast for producing nations outside of the pact between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, raising its projections for non-OPEC supply growth by 290,000 barrels a day to an increase of 830,000 barrels a day this year.<br />At the same time, the IEA trimmed its forecast for global oil demand by 200,000 barrels a day to 96.4 million barrels—around 3% less than in 2019—but said part of that was because of a change to historic data.<br />Even so, with much of the developed world grappling with fresh Covid-19 variants and lockdown restrictions, a brightening economic outlook and strict supply discipline from OPEC-plus are hastening the drawdown in global oil inventories, the IEA said. It added that “the prospect of tighter markets ahead” has been responsible for a rally in oil prices in recent weeks.</td>

And that isn’t unusual internationally. Tech companies, those plugged into the supply chain for electronics and some biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms boomed in 2020.<br />The advocates for profit-sharing or something like it have a stronger case than advocates of high corporate profit taxes: Much of the dispersion between the strong and weak performers over the past year has been down to luck rather than business ingenuity or astute management.<br />Among South Korea’s best-performing companies during the past year is  Seegene Inc.,  which recorded profit growth of more than 1,000% year-over-year in the third quarter. As a producer of diagnostic kits, it would have struggled to do poorly in the circumstances. On the other end of the scale,  Korean Air Lines Co.  has seen profits collapse. It would have been impossible to avert such a scenario for a passenger airline.<br />For now, the discussions are of a voluntary program in which large companies contribute to help struggling smaller firms.

A spokesman for the committee declined to comment.

She has been leading the handling of the hack fallout since day one of the Biden administration, said Emily Horne, an NSC spokeswoman.

Ms. Neuberger is also focused on launching a study of the SolarWinds breach to learn lessons and to prevent such incidents in the future, Ms. Horne said.<br />On Tuesday, Sens. Mark Warner and Marco Rubio, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to various federal cybersecurity leaders asking for the administration to “empower a clear leader in the United States’ response to the SolarWinds cyber breach that has affected numerous federal agencies.”<br />The senators also expressed agitation with the lack of details provided thus far to Congress about the hack, which current and former intelligence officials and private-sector cybersecurity experts have widely described as one of the worst hacks on record.

The mix of migrants stayed largely steady from previous months, with single adults from Mexico accounting for most of the arrests, and families and unaccompanied children ticking up.<br />That continues a recent shift from the trend since 2014, when children and families from Central America, who are more likely to seek asylum, comprised the majority of migrants at the border.<br />The overall rise likely has several causes. Poverty and gang violence were exacerbated by a pair of hurricanes that hit Central America late last year, devastating the region’s economies. Mexico is suffering its worst economic slump in decades, prompting people to seek work across the border.<br />Authorities also said smugglers in the region have been telling migrants that President Biden’s administration, which has reversed many of the Trump administration’s strict immigration policies, would be more likely to allow them to stay in the U.S.</td>

      <td>House Democrats serving as impeachment managers made their case in the Senate on Wednesday</td>
      <td>Day two of the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump featured Democratic House impeachment managers making the first half of their case that he should be convicted for inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Here are five takeaways from the day:<br />Many senators, serving as jurors, appeared to be riveted and emotional as videos brought back the events of that day. House managers played audio of a terrified officer saying, “They have breached the scaffold, they are behind our lines.” They showed pro-Trump rioters bursting into the Capitol saying “stop the count,” converging at the threshold of the House floor with chants of “we want Trump,” and one rioter telling another who had called for no violence “it’s too late for that.” Another rioter could be heard calling out “Where are you Nancy?” and others could be heard chanting “Hang Mike Pence.” Managers played video of the fatal shooting of Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt as she tried to climb through a shattered window into the House lobby, and closed their predinner session by playing a single clip of Officer Daniel Hodges letting out a bone-chilling cry as rioters trapped him in between two doors, blood dripping from his mouth as he struggled to breathe.<br />House Democratic managers aimed to show that Mr. Trump planned the attack by cultivating a base of people he knew to be violent, issuing a “save the date” notice through a Dec. 19 tweet calling for his supporters to “be there, will be wild,” and then timing his speech asserting that “you’ll never take back our country with weakness” to conclude around 1 p.m.—just as Congress met in a joint session to certify President Biden’s Electoral College win. In the weeks before the attack, Mr. Trump’s supporters responded that “the cavalry is coming,” according to social-media posts that managers used to show rioters had been primed by months of Mr. Trump’s assertions that he would only lose if the election had been stolen.<br />Republicans said that despite the presentation, they weren’t convinced that Mr. Trump had caused the violence. “I don’t think it was inciting the riot,” said Sen. James Lankford (R., Okla.). Seventeen Republicans are needed to join 50 Democrats in convicting the president. With only a handful of GOP senators indicating they could vote to convict him, the question was whether any new Republicans would be moved. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican, did say that the managers had “done a good job connecting the dots.”<br />The managers personalized their arguments by showing the stakes faced by individual senators. One of the most compelling videos depicted Officer Eugene Goodman directing Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) to turn around and run in a different direction, away from a mob that was bearing down on the Capitol. Mr. Romney said he had remembered the encounter but hadn’t realized the officer was Mr. Goodman, and that it was the first time he had seen the video. After it played at trial, Mr. Romney could be seen talking to Mr. Goodman, where he said he expressed his appreciation to the officer and heard about Mr. Goodman’s trials on Jan. 6, including the nausea he felt after being subjected to tear gas and bear spray.</td>

      <td>Grand jury charges swimmer Klete Keller with felony offenses along with others suspected of being among the first to break into Capitol</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Gold-medal Olympic swimmer Klete Keller was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges related to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, as prosecutors pursue additional counts against the alleged rioters including one that comes with a potential 20-year sentence.<br />In indictments returned Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Keller was charged with seven counts, including obstructing an official proceeding. Similar charges were also brought against two brothers from Montana who allegedly climbed through broken windows at the Capitol and forced their way to the Senate floor, and an alleged QAnon adherent from Iowa who was among the first rioters to enter the Capitol.<br />The law cited in the obstruction count falls under the broad witness-tampering statute and carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Many of the more than 200 people who face federal charges to date related to the Capitol riot were first arrested on criminal complaints that carried charges with lesser penalties. Prosecutors said they planned to seek indictments against most of the alleged rioters, and could add counts as the investigation progressed.<br />The brothers, Joshua and Jerod Hughes, and the Iowa man, Douglas Jensen, were allegedly part of a mob that chased Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman up a set of stairs close to the Senate chamber. That episode figured prominently in video footage shown by Democratic impeachment managers during Mr. Trump’s Senate trial on Wednesday.<br />Mr. Keller was first identified several days after the Capitol insurrection in widely circulated screenshots of video footage and photos taken inside the building. He stood out in the crowd for his height, 6-foot-6, and the navy blue jacket he wore bearing the seal of the U.S. Olympic Team. In addition to the obstruction charge, Mr. Keller faces counts of civil disorder, entering and engaging in disorderly conduct in a restricted building, and other counts. A lawyer for Mr. Keller declined to comment.</td>

Mr. Jiang was a second-year student in the forestry program at the university’s School of the Environment, according to university officials.<br />New Haven Police Department Chief Otoniel Reyes said at a Wednesday press conference outside the department’s headquarters that Qinxuan Pan, 29, was a person of interest in Mr. Jiang’s killing.<br />Chief Reyes said Mr. Pan, an MIT graduate and Malden, Mass., resident, should be considered armed and dangerous. “Extreme caution should be used if you come in contact with this individual,” Chief Reyes said.<br />Police have a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Pan for the possession of a stolen vehicle, according to Chief Reyes. The chief said police are investigating the possibility that Mr. Pan was in a vehicle that struck a vehicle operated by Mr. Jiang shortly before Mr. Jiang was shot to death.</td>

      <td>WHO team scrutinizing cases of 90 patients with coronavirus-like symptoms in October 2019, two months before Beijing acknowledged first infections</td>
      <td>BEIJING—About 90 people were hospitalized with Covid-19-like symptoms in central China in the two months before the disease was first identified in Wuhan in late 2019, according to World Health Organization investigators, who said they pressed Beijing to allow further testing to determine whether the new virus was spreading earlier than previously known.<br />Chinese authorities performed antibody tests on about two-thirds of those patients in the past few months, according to the investigators, and said they found no trace of infection by the virus. But members of the WHO team probing the pandemic’s origins said any antibodies could have subsided to undetectable levels during the delay.<br />“Further studies are needed,” said Peter Ben Embarek, the food-safety scientist who led the WHO team, which wrapped up a four-week visit to China on Wednesday.<br />Team members said they urged China to conduct wider tests on blood samples collected in autumn 2019 around Hubei, the province that is home to Wuhan, to look for evidence about when the virus was first circulating. Chinese authorities said they hadn’t yet obtained necessary permissions to test samples, many of which are held in blood banks, WHO investigators said.<br />China’s disclosures to the WHO raise questions about the possibility that Covid-19—which has now killed more than 2.3 million people—was already spreading in China as far back as October 2019 and that earlier detection could have helped contain the outbreak before it became a global pandemic. Beijing says the first patient identified in China developed symptoms on Dec. 8, 2019.</td>

SK Innovation has denied the allegations.<br />The commission’s ruling threatens two new battery plants SKI is building in Georgia to supply Ford and VW with batteries for models set to go into production in the next two years. The Korean company has said it is investing $2.6 billion on the project.<br />The ruling also complicates efforts by the Biden administration to supercharge domestic battery and electric vehicle construction. Wednesday’s ruling starts the clock on a 60-day review period for the White House. Changes to the commission’s rulings are rare but not without precedent.<br />If the White House declines to intervene, then SKI can appeal the matter in federal court. Construction on the site will proceed, a company spokesman said before the ruling.</td>

      <td>Even a $130 billion bribe won’t get them back in the classroom this school year.</td>
      <td>President Biden made an early pandemic show by promising that a majority of American schools would reopen in his first 100 days in office. But on Tuesday we learned that this depends on the meaning of the word “reopen.”<br />“His goal that he set is to have the majority of schools, so more than 50 percent, open by day 100 of his presidency and that means some teaching in classrooms,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. “So at least one day a week.”<br />One day out of five? We doubt that’s how working parents define open.<br />Ms. Psaki is trying to make a virtue out of a humiliating political embarrassment. Mr. Biden figured that his support for the teachers union agenda, along with more money, would get the unions to reopen the schools. Instead he’s discovering what America’s parents have learned in the last year: Unions run the schools, and no one—not parents, not school districts, not mayors, and not even a new Democratic President—will tell them what to do. So it’s one day a week, pal. Get used to it.<br />This really is one of the great scandals of the pandemic. At first unions demanded that cases drop in their cities before schools open. Now cases are falling almost everywhere. So unions are insisting that teachers must be vaccinated before returning.</td>

      <td>He might be acquitted, but he won’t live down his disgraceful conduct.</td>
      <td>Whether a former President ought to be subject to an impeachment trial is a matter of constitutional debate. Whether it’s prudent, if acquittal appears likely, is a related question. But wherever you come down on those issues, the House impeachment managers this week are laying out a visceral case that the Capitol riot of Jan. 6 was a disgrace for which President Trump bears responsibility.<br />Long before November, Mr. Trump was saying that the only way he could lose the election was if it were rigged. On the night of the vote, he tweeted, “they are trying to STEAL the election.” In his speech that night, he called it “a fraud on the American public,” and said, “frankly we did win.” Is it a surprise that some of his fans took his words to heart?<br />Instead of bowing to dozens of court defeats, Mr. Trump escalated. He falsely claimed that Vice President Mike Pence, if only he had the courage, could reject electoral votes and stop Democrats from hijacking democracy. He called his supporters to attend a rally on Jan. 6, when Congress would do the counting. “Be there, will be wild!” Mr. Trump tweeted. His speech that day was timed to coincide with the action in the Capitol, and then he directed the crowd down Pennsylvania Avenue.<br />Mr. Trump’s defenders point out that he also told the audience to make their voices heard “peacefully.” And contra Rep. Eric Swalwell, who argued the incitement to attack the Capitol was “premeditated,” it’s difficult to think Mr. Trump ever envisioned what followed: that instead of merely making a boisterous display, the crowd would riot, assault the police, invade the building, send lawmakers fleeing with gas masks, trash legislative offices, and leave in its wake a dead Capitol officer.<br />But talk about playing with fire. Mr. Trump told an apocalyptic fable in which American democracy might end on Jan. 6, and some people who believed him acted like it. Once the riot began, Mr. Trump took hours to say anything, a delay his defenders have not satisfactorily explained. Even then he equivocated. Imagine, Rep. Joe Neguse said, if Mr. Trump “had simply gone onto TV, just logged on to  Twitter  and said ‘Stop the Attack,’ if he had done so with even half as much force as he said ‘Stop the Steal.’”</td>

      <td>Biden is rethinking Trump’s reckless May 1 withdrawal.</td>
      <td>October will mark 20 years since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan to eliminate al Qaeda sanctuaries and its Taliban sponsors, and Americans are understandably eager to move on. But the difficulties that come with America’s current commitment are nothing compared with the chaos that would follow an abrupt departure.<br />In February 2020 the Trump Administration and Taliban signed a withdrawal agreement that requires all U.S. troops to leave by May 1, 2021. The move was driven by Donald Trump’s domestic political instincts—not a strategic calculation. President Biden is wisely reviewing that decision.<br />“I’m very pleased with what the Biden Administration is proposing for Afghanistan,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican, said on Sunday. “They’re re-evaluating our presence in Afghanistan to keep the footprint low, but not to walk away and lose all the gains we’ve achieved.” The White House hasn’t announced a final decision, but Mr. Graham expects the U.S. to remain beyond May.<br />Many Democrats and isolationist-leaning Republicans get attention for their calls to end “forever wars” immediately. But Mr. Graham’s comments are a reminder that there’s also broad support for a more careful approach. The question is not whether the U.S. will leave Afghanistan but whether it will do so responsibly.<br />The bipartisan Afghanistan Study Group has made a persuasive case for how to do that in its report to Congress this month. The group—former generals, Senators, ambassadors and national-security officials—suggests replacing Mr. Trump’s timeline with a conditions-based approach. “A withdrawal would not only leave America more vulnerable to terrorist threats,” the report says, “it would also have catastrophic effects in Afghanistan and the region that would not be in the interest of any of the key actors, including the Taliban.”</td>
