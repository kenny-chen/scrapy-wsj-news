      <td>Shell and Exxon lose landmark decisions on the same day, demonstrating growing threats to fossil-fuel companies from activists and investors</td>
      <td>Exxon  Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch  Shell  PLC suffered significant defeats Wednesday as environmental groups and activist investors step up pressure on the oil industry to address concerns about climate change.<br />In a first-of-its-kind ruling, a Dutch court found that Shell is partially responsible for climate change, and ordered the company to sharply reduce its carbon emissions. Hours later in the U.S., an activist investor won at least two seats on Exxon’s board, a historic defeat for the oil giant that will likely require it to alter its fossil-fuel focused strategy.<br />The back-to-back, watershed decisions demonstrated how dramatically the landscape is shifting for oil-and-gas companies as they face increasing pressure from environmentalists, investors, lenders, politicians and regulators to transition to cleaner forms of energy.<br />“The events of today show definitively that many leaders in the oil-and-gas industry have a tin ear and do not understand that society’s views and the legal and political environment in which they operate are changing radically,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School who has advised energy companies.<br />Many oil companies have begun adopting comprehensive plans to reduce emissions, and some, especially in Europe, have diversified into renewable energy. But reducing emissions while generating returns is proving challenging, and many face skepticism about their strategies.</td>

      <td>Graphics-chip maker says quarterly gaming revenue more than doubled from year-ago period</td>
      <td>Nvidia Corp.  reported a record quarterly revenue and profit, propelled by demand for videogaming and cryptocurrency and despite a broad-based shortage of semiconductors.<br />The chip maker on Wednesday posted net income for its most recent quarter of $1.91 billion, more than double the year-prior figure. Revenue rose 84% to $5.66 billion. Both profit and revenue exceeded expectations, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.<br />Nvidia is the latest chip company to have enjoyed months of booming demand for computing power that has padded order books. The hot market has triggered shortages of some chips, affecting companies as varied as  Apple Inc.  and  Ford Motor Co.  and contributing to President Biden’s recent call for $50 billion to strengthen the U.S. semiconductor industry.<br />Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia, which last year became the U.S.’s biggest chip company by value, specializes in graphics processors that have flown off shelves as people flocked to videogaming for entertainment during the coronavirus pandemic. The way those graphic chips work has also made them popular for other applications, including performing artificial-intelligence calculations and mining cryptocurrencies, further inflating demand.<br />Nvidia’s gaming division—its largest in terms of revenue—more than doubled sales in the quarter. Sales for its datacenter business advanced 79% from the year earlier to more than $2 billion. The main drivers behind the record revenue were graphics cards for laptops and personal computers, said financial chief Colette Kress. Cryptocurrency demand also aided results, she said, with some uncertainty as to the extent of its contribution.</td>

      <td>The ‘Friends’ reunion show on HBO Max is the culmination of a fervent nostalgia trip encompassing everything ’90s—particularly the body-conscious fashion worn by Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green</td>
      <td>Off Brand is a column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />POORVA SETH, 21, a recent graduate of the University of Toronto, wore a tight white T-shirt, beige jacket, miniskirt and knee-high boots to an outdoor lunch date this spring. Her sartorial inspiration? Rachel Green, the character that Jennifer Aniston played in the ultra-popular sitcom “Friends.” The show, which is being revisited in a reunion special on HBO Max this week, went off the air just a few years after Ms. Seth was born in 1999. Yet like many Gen-Z women, she considers Rachel Green “the style icon that I look to the most.”<br />Although it’s been nearly 30 years since “Friends” debuted in 1994, its avant-basic aesthetic is a source of inspiration for many people who were too young to absorb it the first time around. Although the show’s kooky coffee-shop set design has not endured in the same way, its body-conscious and colorful fashion is having a moment. Specifically the styles worn by Rachel Green, the show’s resident fashion plate, who had evolved from an unemployable suburban princess into a polished Ralph Lauren executive by the time series ended its run in 2004. Emily Perry, who runs the popular Instagram account @everyfriendsoutfit, noticed, “More than any other ‘Friend’ her outfits get the most questions about where and how to buy certain pieces and get shared widely.”<br />According to Google data from 2020 compiled by Money.co.uk, Rachel Green was the TV character with the most-searched style, easily beating the next in line, Maddy Perez from the far-more-current HBO show “Euphoria.” Image-sharing platform  Pinterest  reports that searches for “Rachel Green aesthetic” are eight times higher over the last month than during the same time period in 2017, and searches for “Rachel Green outfits” have increased by 58%.<br />Both those who lived through the 1990s, as well as those who devour that decade’s look on TikTok, know what the Rachel Green look entails: skinny layered T-shirts, knee-high boots, overalls, slip dresses, low-rise cargo pants, shorts with tights, plaid mini-skirts, buttoned cardigans. Although what I recall most powerfully about Rachel Green from the (actual) ’90s was her highlighted shag hairdo—the “Rachel”—it now takes a back seat to her fashion. Currently trending on TikTok: videos enumerating style lessons learned from Rachel Green (for example, “A Little Black Dress is always a good idea”).</td>

      <td>President Biden’s pick to lead a key agency that will be involved in the administration’s efforts to curb gun violence faced opposition Wednesday from Republican senators, as some cited his advocacy for tighter gun control laws.<br />David Chipman, if confirmed, would lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.<br />In an evenly divided Senate, Mr. Chipman needs to secure all 50 Democratic votes to be confirmed, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting a tiebreaking vote.<br />Mr. Chipman spent 25 years as an ATF agent and oversaw the bureau’s firearms programs, among other roles. Mr. Chipman most recently served as a top policy adviser to the gun-control organization Giffords, led by former Democratic Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in 2011 along with 18 others in a Tucson-area supermarket parking lot. Six people died in the attack.<br />At a hearing Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, (R., Iowa), the committee’s minority leader, likened Mr. Chipman’s nomination to “putting a tobacco executive in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services.”</td>

The retail behemoth earlier this year named fashion designer Brandon Maxwell as creative director of Free Assembly and Scoop, private-label brands that Walmart says are part of its “elevated fashion brands.” This month, Walmart said it would acquire ZeekIt, which allows digital shoppers to see how clothes might look on their bodies or models with similar bodies.<br />Gap, which has been working to revive its namesake brand, doesn’t currently sell homegoods and has never sold its branded items inside Walmart.<br />Gap signed a deal last year with licensing company IMG that will allow it to expand into home décor, furniture, textiles and other categories. The agreement also includes Gap’s Banana Republic brand.</td>

      <td>How two resourceful Allies used spiritualism, deception and distinctively British nonsense to escape a Turkish prison camp in World War I.</td>
      <td>Tales of spunky prisoners of war suffering horrifying privation or outfoxing their sadistic or imbecilic captors are a staple of military history and the movies. John McCain devotes much of his Vietnam memoir “Faith of My Fathers” to his ordeal in the Hanoi Hilton, and “Stalag 17,” “The Bridge on the River Kwai,” “The Great Escape” and “Unbroken” are great films. Fact or fiction, few of them can match the latest entry in the genre for screwball comedy.<br />Margalit Fox’s “The Confidence Men” tells the tale of two Allied officers captured by the Turks during World War I who escaped their remote prison camp by pulling an ingenious and elaborate spiritualist con on the camp’s greedy commandant. A onetime writer of obituaries for the New York Times and the author of three other books, Ms. Fox brings a deadpan touch to her story.<br />Close your eyes and you can picture the young Sean Connery and Michael Caine of “The Man Who Would Be King” playing the two leads in a film based on the book. The impresario of the bizarre escape plan was Elias Henry Jones, 33, an Oxford-educated barrister and onetime magistrate in Burma during the British Raj. The son of a Welsh lord, Jones, a second lieutenant in the Indian Army Reserve, was captured after the disastrous siege of Kūt-al-‘Amāra, in what is now Iraq, in April 1916. His accomplice was Cedric Waters Hill, just 25, an Australian mechanic who became a pilot and just happened to be a skillful amateur sleight-of-hand artist.<br />After a hideous 62-day trek with other POWs covering nearly 2,000 miles, Jones was deposited in the Yozgat camp, a cluster of repurposed buildings in a small village in remote Anatolia, “the Alcatraz of its day.” Hill showed up not long after. The camp was commanded by Kiazim Bey, an aging autocrat who lived in fear of his prisoners escaping. His young aide-de-camp and translator was Moïse Eskenazi, a diminutive, officious Ottoman Jewish soldier, known to the prisoners as “the Pimple.” The British officers endured quarters crawling with vermin and choked down rotten food, but they were an enterprising lot. They formed an orchestra, gave lectures, held classes and staged entertainments. Jones fashioned a Ouija board from scrap, and using an inverted glass as a planchette, began giving mock readings for his fellow captives—the inspiration for his escape plot.<br />“The Confidence Men” is essentially a shaggy-dog thriller, so a tick-tock of their intricate scam with its twists and turns and near-disasters would cheat the reader. But it won’t spoil anything to report that their scheme involved a half-dozen spirits “summoned” by Jones surreptitiously manipulating the board, the chief of whom was “the Spook.” There was also a fiendishly complicated mind-reading act based on a memorized system of word clues relayed by the stooge to the sham mentalist. And a code using Welsh words to fool the Turkish censors while communicating with family back in Britain. Plus “trance-talking”—when the Ouija board was unavailable—not to mention the “Telechronistic Ray,” the “Four Cardinal Point Receiver,” a staged double hanging, and six months of feigned madness in a Turkish hospital.</td>

      <td>A bankruptcy judge said will let the OxyContin maker send its chapter 11 plan to creditors for a vote, a critical milestone that keeps the company on track for an August trial over its bankruptcy exit</td>
      <td>Purdue Pharma LP is preparing to poll creditors on its bankruptcy exit plan, a critical milestone as the OxyContin manufacturer prepares for a summer trial over a chapter 11 proposal that earmarks billions of dollars for opioid abatement programs.<br />Judge Robert Drain of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y., said Wednesday he intends to approve Purdue’s disclosure statement, a document describing the proposed repayment terms on which creditors will vote.<br />Judge Drain said he would formally approve the disclosure statement and accompanying solicitation materials that will be sent to creditors after lawyers incorporate final changes to the documents that were discussed at Wednesday’s hearing.<br />Purdue’s creditors are a vast and diverse group that includes states, municipalities, tribes, school districts and thousands of people who have asserted personal injury claims over OxyContin, the company’s flagship drug. Judge Drain said the disclosure statement provides Purdue creditors with sufficient information to give an informed vote on the chapter 11 plan.<br />The judge’s remarks follow weeks of negotiations between lawyers for Purdue and state authorities who demanded the drugmaker disclose more information about how the chapter 11 plan would work. Opponents have challenged a component of the chapter 11 plan that would release members of the Sackler family who own Purdue from thousands of opioid-related lawsuits in exchange for a $4.28 billion payment. The family has denied wrongdoing.</td>

      <td>The evidence catches up to Fauci and other Wuhan Covid deniers.</td>
      <td>President Biden on Wednesday ordered U.S. intelligence to dig deeper into the origins of Covid-19, a reversal after he reportedly ordered a State Department investigative unit shut down. Mr. Biden is trying to cover for his embarrassing closure of the investigation because the dam has finally broken on the evidence that the virus may have escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). The shame is that it took so long because the suspicious facts have been apparent from the start.<br />In January 2020, international media began reporting about a virus spreading in the Chinese city of Wuhan. “The coronavirus could result in a global pandemic,” said Sen. Tom Cotton on Jan. 30, 2020. “I would note that Wuhan has China’s only biosafety level-four super laboratory that works with the world’s most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus.”<br />The world would learn more about Covid-19—and the WIV. But it was always reasonable to ask if the virus came from a nearby lab that handled dangerous viruses. On Feb. 6, 2020, Botao Xiao of the South China University of Technology posted a paper concluding the virus “probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.” But the Chinese government strictly controls research into Covid-19’s origins, and the molecular biomechanics researcher withdrew his publication.<br />The Communist Party then went on offense, with Beijing’s ambassador to the U.S. declaring that lab-leak theories were “absolutely crazy” and could “fan up racial discrimination, xenophobia.” After Mr. Cotton responded by calling on China to “open up now to competent international scientists,” the media chose denial: “Tom Cotton keeps repeating a coronavirus conspiracy theory that was already debunked” (Washington Post) and “Senator Tom Cotton Repeats Fringe Theory of Coronavirus Origins” ( New York Times ).<br />The public-health clerisy also set boundaries for allowable discussion. On Feb. 19, 2020, the Lancet published a statement by scientists condemning “conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.” Although some academics quietly dissented, the document was promoted as proof that the lab possibility was “debunked.”</td>

      <td>Two board challengers win, but fossil fuels aren’t going away.</td>
      <td>The usual suspects are casting  Exxon  Mobil’s partial defeat in a proxy shareholder battle on Wednesday as a Waterloo for fossil fuels. Sorry—the vote is a reflection of the enormous political pressure and financial leverage of government pension funds, proxy advisers and asset managers like  BlackRock  that want to be seen as virtuous to the progressives who are now in power.<br />The San Francisco-based hedge fund Engine No. 1 formed in November of last year and set out to overhaul Exxon’s board. Its goal: Make the biggest U.S. oil and gas company “transition” out of its legacy business. The fund enlisted big public pension funds and exploited the pandemic’s ravages.<br />Exxon had to “wake up” and “get out of the oil and gas focus,” California State Teachers’ Retirement System (Calstrs) Chief Investment Officer Chris Ailman said in December. Critics said Exxon’s board was too deferential to management, which had invested in U.S. shale and cranked up debt as oil and gas prices plunged.<br />Critics also flogged former CEO Rex Tillerson’s big bet on Canada’s oil sands, which became unprofitable amid low prices. Exxon’s main misjudgment was to underestimate the impact of U.S. shale fracking on oil prices. It was late to shale and then paid a hefty sum for fracking pioneer XTO Energy in 2010.<br />While its European rivals have forged into renewables like wind and solar, Exxon has made a long-term bet that the world will need oil and gas for many more decades. It estimates that some $12 trillion to $17 trillion in new investment will be needed to generate enough oil and natural gas supplies to meet global demand through 2040.</td>

      <td>Covering the Afghan retreat but leaving the Asia-Pacific.</td>
      <td>The Journal reported Wednesday that the Pentagon plans to dispatch the USS Ronald Reagan, the only aircraft carrier operating in the Asia-Pacific theater, to the Middle East to cover the U.S. and NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan. This may seem like no big deal, but it highlights the U.S. Navy’s dearth of ships to meet its military missions.<br />The redeployment means the U.S. for several months will be without a carrier in the Western Pacific. The Reagan will sail to replace the aging USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which has to return home soon after two long deployments in 36 months. The U.S. has to cover the retreat from Afghanistan, but the deployment dilemma won’t end once U.S. troops leave.<br />President Biden has promised the U.S. can fulfill an antiterror mission in Afghanistan from over the horizon, but it isn’t clear how that will be done. Doing it with a carrier in the region would be a misuse of naval resources. It would have made more sense to remain in Afghanistan with a residual military force.<br />The missing carrier in East Asia should send a message that the U.S. is going to need more naval assets and a better strategy, or it’s going to have to shrink its commitments around the world. The problem is more urgent than Americans recognize.</td>

Next, Mr. Biden named four new appointments in their place.<br />“I respectfully decline your request to resign,” shot back Justin Shubow, the commission’s chairman, who was appointed to a four-year term in October 2018. “No commissioner has ever been removed by a President, let alone the commission’s chairman. Any such removal would set a terrible precedent.”<br />Mr. Shubow is right to stand firm against executive overreach. Established by Congress in 1910, this independent federal agency has overseen “matters of design and aesthetics, as they affect the federal interest and preserve the dignity of the nation’s capital,” according to the commission’s own description. Composed of seven members with expertise in the arts, the unpaid commission has historically risen above partisan politics—in part by being appointed as terms expire, not at every change of administration. From Taft to Trump, no American president had gone against this tradition.<br />The four commissioners on the chopping block are seasoned architects, artists and preservationists. Mr. Biden’s move against the peaceful transition of power for these design professionals reveals the high stakes of aesthetics in a newly woke Washington. As Trump appointees, all four are assumed to be defenders of Washington’s classical forms. Coming out of a period of astonishing violence that has sought to destroy symbols of America’s classical inheritance, the four commissioners are for the left but the latest monuments to “white supremacy” to tumble.<br />One wouldn’t think preserving and extending Washington’s classical order should invite controversy. This is a city where a Senate meets on a Capitol Hill, named after the Capitoline Hill in Rome. The Commission of Fine Arts was established to promote classical unity. Inspired by the City Beautiful movement that began in the 1890s, the agency played a key role in tying together the architecture of the White House and the Capitol with a program of new buildings and monuments, such as the Lincoln Memorial of 1922.</td>

      <td>Expect prices to moderate as demand shifts to travel and other experiences from consumer goods.</td>
      <td>The rise in inflation doesn’t stem from booming demand associated with the reopening of bars, restaurants, concert venues and stadiums, as many have claimed. It reflects the extent to which manufacturers were caught off balance by the pandemic last year. That’s good news, because the problem is temporary. As more consumer spending gets rerouted in the months ahead from durable goods such as camping gear and hot tubs to experiences like travel and live events, inflation is likely to moderate.<br />Fearful that 2020 would be a replay of the economic collapse of 2008-09, many manufacturers cut back on output and capacity to conserve cash. But instead of shrinking, sales of durable goods like autos, furniture, motorcycles and hot tubs, rose at rates not seen in decades, creating shortages and price pressures.<br />Most of the 6.5% drop in manufacturing output in 2020 can be attributed to the initial lockdowns, which shuttered production in China in January and February and Europe and North America in March and April. But rather than aggressively scale up production schedules once factories were reopened and health and safety protocols were in place, manufacturers remained understandably cautious. For many companies, orders ran ahead of production. Employment remained well below pre-pandemic averages. Many firms kept inventories of finished goods and necessary inputs to a minimum.<br />Consumption could hardly have evolved more differently. Deprived of concerts, vacations, sporting events, fine dining and other experiences, consumers splurged on new and used cars, furniture, computers, phones, games, toys and bikes. Spending on these recreational items was up by 25% or more, on average, during the pandemic. Housing demand reached levels last seen in 2006, as low interest rates, social distancing and remote work spurred households to seek new homes or renovate existing residences.<br />It’s no surprise that surging demand and diminished supply have led to shortages, not only of finished manufactured goods like hot tubs and couches, but also of the components, parts and raw materials that go into them. Shortages of these inputs exacerbate the problem by inhibiting new production, leading to larger backlogs and even greater price pressure.</td>

      <td>A U.S. federal judge shut down an attempt by Bayer AG to limit all future liability related to its popular Roundup weedkiller, concluding in a Wednesday order that the proposal would benefit the company much more than Roundup users who blame the product for causing cancer.<br />Bayer has said it would pay up to $9.6 billion to settle existing Roundup cases that tie the product to non-Hodgkin lymphoma and another $2 billion toward future claims. The German company lost three trials between 2018 and 2019 brought by Roundup users who said the product caused their cancer and is working to resolve around 125,000 similar claims.<br />The company’s attempt to resolve the future cases came in the form of a novel class-action settlement, which sought to bind people who have used Roundup but aren’t yet sick, as well as Roundup users with cancer who haven’t already sued.<br />In a six-page order, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco pointed to what he called “glaring flaws” in the proposal, including that it offered few benefits for those who haven’t yet gotten sick while forcing them to give up substantial legal rights down the line.<br />Bayer representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment Wednesday.</td>

It would fund roads, bridges, ports, waterways, airports, public transit and broadband without undoing the 2017 tax reforms.<br />Democrats had already ridiculed Republican criticism of the president’s plan, employing a laughably expansive definition of infrastructure spending. “Paid leave is infrastructure. Child care is infrastructure. Caregiving is infrastructure,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand tweeted.</td>

      <td>A decades-old note to get my daughter ‘More Fruit Medley.’</td>
      <td>Fetching familiar books from my shelf for another summer reading season, I’ve been finding pieces of my past within the covers. Although friends and loved ones like to give me designer bookmarks, I usually mark my place in a book with whatever’s at hand: a dry cleaner’s receipt, an old grocery list, the stub of a movie ticket, a torn scrap from a travel itinerary.<br />These small remnants of personal biography tend to linger within the fiction, poetry, history and memoir that line the living room bookcase. Years later, retrieving a volume for another look, I inevitably indulge in accidental archaeology. Slips of paper emerge from the pages like old musket balls or arrowheads plowed up from the depths of decades. With startling clarity, I glimpse the man I used to be.<br />The other afternoon, for example, while leafing through my well-worn copy of “Robinson Crusoe,” I came across a bit of loose-leaf scribbled with three words: “More Fruit Medley.” That was the flavor of my daughter’s favorite baby food, and this was a reminder for a young father to get a fresh supply. I’ve been dipping into Daniel Defoe’s classic castaway tale every summer since I was a boy. In my summers of early parenthood, “Crusoe” pointed to a solitude that then seemed forever out of reach. As one, then two toddlers tugged at my sleeves, I couldn’t imagine time alone.<br />Our son and daughter are grown now and living away. This summer, sitting in the profound quiet of an empty den while my wife runs errands or tends the garden, I’ll meet Mr. Crusoe as a different reader. Solitude for me these days is at easy arm’s reach, and I’m scanning this adventure yarn for insights into how those unbroken hours might best be used. Defoe’s hero, who passes his tropical idyll in reading, small excursions and occasional home improvement, might continue to teach me a thing or two about what an ideal summer looks like.<br />Which is why, I suppose, I reread books in the first place. Although they stay the same from summer to summer, I’m still a work in progress. As the little leavings of summers drop from the corners of their spines, my books tell me that I’m a creature of change, even in late middle age.</td>

Less explored is the damage TDS did to the U.S. political system’s ability to function, as now with a Jan. 6 commission.</td>

He said that there is a divergence among officials in the American intelligence community, or IC, on how the virus might have emerged.<br />“While two elements in the IC lean toward the former scenario and one leans more toward the latter—each with low or moderate confidence—the majority of elements do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other,” Mr. Biden said in a statement Wednesday. He refrained from outlining the positions of specific intelligence agencies.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday on a previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report that three researchers from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care.</td>

Callaway denied any wrongdoing at the time.<br />Moments after the league’s announcement on Wednesday, the Angels said they had fired him.<br />“I apologize to the women who shared with investigators any interaction that made them feel uncomfortable,” Callaway said in a statement. “However, those are my own blind spots, and I take responsibility for the consequences.”<br />In a statement, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Callaway violated the league’s policies and would be placed on the ineligible list through, at least, the end of the 2022 season, at which point he can apply for reinstatement.

      <td>A San Francisco museum channels the spirit of Bacchus in an exhibit of food- and drink-related art and objects that range from the mundane to the downright naughty.</td>
      <td>San Francisco<br />Pompeii beckons. Frozen in time when it was engulfed in volcanic ash and debris from Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79, then rediscovered in 1748, this ancient Roman town has fascinated the public ever since. Before the pandemic intervened, tourists were limited to 15,000 at a time, lest the site be overrun; now reopened, it is selling timed tickets and keeping attendance even lower.<br />The curious, however, may be partly sated at the Legion of Honor of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, where “Last Supper in Pompeii: From the Table to the Grave” is on view through Aug. 29. With about 150 objects—from life-size marble sculptures and room-size garden frescoes to toothpicks made of bone and lentils carbonized by the 550-degree-plus heat of the eruption—the exhibition zeroes in on the eating and drinking culture of Pompeii. It’s drawn from a larger 2019-20 show at Oxford University’s Ashmolean Museum; but it has been slimmed down to eliminate duplicate utensils and a section on Roman Britain, and beefed up to add more art objects, such as a dining couch (first century A.D.) from the site and a fetching, ivy-wreathed bronze head of Bacchus (first half, first century A.D.) borrowed from the J. Paul Getty Museum.<br />Bacchus, the god of wine and fertility, hovers over this exhibition, a sign of his importance in the daily life of Pompeians. He’s gloriously imposing as a six-foot marble statue at the entrance (A.D. 50-150), his companion panther at his side. (Like some other pieces in the exhibition, this Bacchus was not actually found at Pompeii, but is representative of the time and place.) He’s amusing, cloaked in grapes like an ancient Bibendum, offering wine to his panther, in a fresco (A.D. 60-79) that once was part of a household shrine. He’s intent, pouring wine from an amphora, in a three-foot bronze (first century A.D.). He’s present symbolically, as a panther, in a one-footed marble table that likely graced the atrium of a wealthy Pompeian home.<br />And where Bacchus is not present overtly, his spirit dominates: The items on display project a sense of conviviality, abetted by bountiful food and drink. In the first gallery, a small fresco (A.D. 40-79) portrays a group of women at a dinner party, with the central figure doling out wine to friends who have already imbibed quite a bit. Later, and more typically, there’s one (A.D. 40-79) showing men and women reclining on couches to dine. This party is even more revelrous—in the Latin scrawled on the wall, a woman announces that she’s going to sing, and a male guest shouts, “Yes, you go for it!” (as translated in the excellent Ashmolean catalog).</td>

They were rewarded with the agreement disclosed Wednesday by Amazon to buy MGM for about $6.5 billion, plus about $2 billion in debt.<br />New York hedge fund Anchorage began telling investors about its potential profit Wednesday. Anchorage invested less than $500 million in 2010, making for an IRR, a return metric that takes into account the length of an investment, of about 16%.<br />MGM’s soaring stock price because of the deal has taken the return of Anchorage’s flagship hedge fund from 8% to 18% this year, said a person briefed on Anchorage’s performance. Anchorage co-founder and MGM board chairman Kevin Ulrich had been negotiating with Amazon’s Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios.<br />The Amazon agreement represents a win for MGM’s hedge-fund holders in a deal whose outcome many doubted along the way. Many other MGM shareholders, and some Anchorage clients, questioned in recent years whether the perks that came with being a movie-studio chieftain influenced the call by Mr. Ulrich to stay so long with MGM, the lengthiest and largest investment in Anchorage’s history.</td>

      <td>As slumber parties return, the hot trend is individual tents, but the production costs needn’t keep parents awake at night</td>
      <td>THREE AND A HALF years ago, Josefina Martinez received photos from her sister-in-law of her nephews at a slumber party in Bogotá. Each child at the party had been assigned his own tyke-size tent, just big enough to cover the top half of a floor mattress. The result was an Instagram-ready alternative to the age-old tradition of kids crashing out on a haphazard collection of sofa cushions, sleeping bags and gym mats.<br />When she searched for more examples of these glamping-inspired overnighters, she found plenty in the U.K. and Australia, but surprisingly few in the U.S. “I saw an opportunity to take sleepovers to the next level,” said the Connecticut tax-attorney-turned-party-planner. “I knew right away that this concept would have a lot of appeal in Greenwich.”<br />These days, on any given weekend in and around her coastal town, you’ll find Ms. Martinez’s company Dream and Party setting up elaborately themed tent villages on lawns and in living rooms. For parents who splurge on catering, decorations and entertainment (tents are often arrayed around jumbo outdoor movie screens) the bill for a sleepover can reach $10,000.<br />Extreme sleepovers are ascendant at just the right moment: After a year of lockdown, parents are eager to indulge their kids, and to do so safely. Having kids glamp out in the backyard, “especially now that it’s nicer out,” is one way to address the situation, says Dr. Ibukun C. Kalu, the medical director for pediatric infection prevention at Duke University Hospital in Durham, N.C. While closer gatherings of vaccinated kids over the age of 12 are possible, taking more care with mixed groups and youngsters is still necessary, said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, professor and chief of the division of infectious diseases, Department of Pediatrics at Stanford Medicine.<br />While Dream and Party’s events can cost the same as a small wedding, you can find more affordable options. Sweet Dreams Sleepover Party Rentals, with locations in Jacksonville, Fla., and Harrisburg, Penn., can outfit a sleepover for five, including tents and decorations, starting at $375. The company also offers a nationwide rental service that will send you five tents for $175, according to owner Ray Young, and are adding “Belle” tents that sleep bigger outdoor groups starting at $400. But many parents who know that the penalty for hosting one great sleepover is hosting more sleepovers are opting to buy rather than rent.  Etsy  storefront Lloyd Creations has made and sold about 8,000 mini tents over the last two years, with 3,000 shipping in the past three months. The company also sells party favors like customized T-shirts and sleep masks.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing new protections for investors in blank-check firms known as special-purpose acquisition companies, deal-making vehicles that surged in popularity over the past year.<br />SEC Chairman Gary Gensler told the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday in prepared remarks that his staff is developing ideas for new rules or guidelines for SPACs. Mr. Gensler questioned whether the SPAC structure appropriately protects small investors, who piled into the recent trading frenzy in blank-check firms.<br />“They’ve just taken off like wildfire, you might say, in the last six months,” he told the committee during a question-and-answer session. “There’s real questions about who’s benefiting and investor protection.”<br />For private companies, SPACs offer a streamlined alternative to initial public offerings. A SPAC initially raises money in its own public offering and lists its shares on a stock exchange. After that, it uses the war chest to hunt for a private company to merge with. If it finds a deal, the private firm takes the SPAC’s listing on the exchange and becomes a public company.<br />Firms that have gone public over the past year through SPAC deals include electric-vehicle companies  Lordstown Motors Corp. , which said Monday that it needs to raise more capital,  Nikola Corp. , and  Fisker Inc.  The SEC’s enforcement division and the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office are probing Nikola, while a short seller has questioned some of the company’s claims about its technology.</td>

      <td>Kimberley Strassel’s “Biden’s Big Labor Bind” (Potomac Watch, May 21) is another laundry list of antiworker talking points. The American Jobs Plan is not threatened by America’s labor movement. It is strengthened by us and the inclusion of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act.<br />Let’s clarify a few points. First, the PRO Act will not “force Americans” into anything. Instead, it will give workers the choice to form a union through a free and fair election. That’s not a power grab—just workplace democracy.<br />Not only is the PRO Act strong policy, it’s good politics. A recent Morning Consult poll found a staggering 73% of voters—including 59% of Republicans—support the right to collectively bargain. The PRO Act will strengthen and expand that right. That’s why, in a rare bipartisan vote, the House passed the PRO Act in March.<br />If anything is stalling the American Jobs Plan, it’s big corporations wanting to pay less in taxes than firefighters and teachers. It’s antiworker senators pretending to care about the deficit after passing a $1.9 trillion tax cut for the ultrawealthy and big corporations four years ago. Scapegoating unions is as stale as trickle-down economics.<br />Let’s not forget President Eisenhower—a Republican who put us to work building America’s Interstate Highway System—said: “Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.” President Biden realizes today what President Eisenhower did a half-century ago: Infrastructure investment and workers’ rights go hand in hand. It’s time to once again build back better with unions.</td>

      <td>Pets aren’t at great risk from eagles or other birds of prey.</td>
      <td>Regarding “The Majestic Bald Eagle Is Back—And Wants to Eat Your Little Dog” (Page One, May 15): Pets aren’t at great risk from eagles or other birds of prey. An emaciated bird will sometimes go for a small pet, but because it poses such a large risk to the raptor, this is a rare occurrence. Bald eagles are capable of carrying only about a third of their body weight, meaning a 12-pound eagle can carry 3 to 4 pounds. In the mainland U.S., a decent-size female eagle would be around 12-pounds, while a male would tip the scales closer to 10 pounds.<br />This article could incite fear about eagles, which could lead to retaliation against the birds. I work in wildlife rehabilitation as well as raptor education. This article only makes our job educating people more difficult, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see an increasing number of raptors being shot.<br />Brian Schug<br />Cascades Raptor Center<br />Eugene, Ore.</td>

      <td>Auto maker’s tech-driven growth plan might not need to pan out perfectly for investors to make gains</td>
      <td>The strategic clarity Chief Executive Jim Farley has brought to  Ford  will be invaluable as the auto industry undergoes seismic changes in the coming years.<br />Mr. Farley, who took the top job in October, pitched the second-largest Detroit auto maker as a technology-driven growth company in his first big investor event Wednesday. The strategy builds on the Wall Street-friendly approach pioneered by  General Motors  under CEO Mary Barra, but with a sharper focus on commercial customers to reflect Ford’s dominance among small and medium-size businesses.<br />The most attention-grabbing aspects of the strategy were around electric vehicles: Ford now plans to spend more than $30 billion by 2025 on EVs, which it expects to account for 40% of its global sales by 2030. The pieces in the company’s electrification strategy have fallen into place this month: It has struck a deal to make lithium-ion batteries with South Korean supplier  SK Innovation ; made an investment in next-generation battery startup Solid Power; and launched the all-electric version of its bestselling F-150.<br />The plan’s more distinctive elements were the creation of a dedicated commercial-vehicle unit to sell both EVs and traditional vehicles to businesses, and a focus on over-the-air software updates. The two are related: Business customers may be earlier than consumers to embrace paying for new services that rely on vehicles’ data connections. Ford sees a $20 billion market for such services by 2030.<br />Such projections are highly speculative—the market barely exists yet—but they form a crucial part of the growth narrative that has re-energized big auto stocks lately. If vehicles can become a constantly upgrading digital-sales platform such as the smartphone, then perhaps the likes of Ford can in time persuade investors that they aren’t just hardware companies—as Tesla and  Apple  have to spectacular effect.</td>

GameStop Corp. ,  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,  and  Express Inc.  are all up more than 36% week-to-date, pushing each stock to levels not seen for weeks—or in some cases, months.<br />The sudden surge is reminiscent of late-January, when individual investors banded together to drive shares of companies once left for dead by Wall Street to unprecedented heights. This week’s rally—though tamer by comparison—has similarly lit up Reddit forums, Discord chat rooms and  Twitter  feeds.<br />Similar to previous rallies among meme stocks throughout this year, no singular or clear catalyst has seemed to drive this week’s rally. Analysts said the jump has likely been driven by a crosscurrent of factors that have prompted individual traders to pile in. With cryptocurrencies having lost much of their steam this month, many nonprofessional traders have re-entered the stock market on the hunt for gains. Platforms such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum have provided a source of continued enthusiasm for meme stocks in particular.<br />“We’ve seen things sidelined for the past month or so, but it’s starting to pick back up again,” said Viraj Patel, global macro strategist at Vanda Research.</td>

The layoffs represent about 8% of the insurer’s approximately 46,000 workers.</td>

      <td>Lawyers say the ruling, which Shell can appeal, could set a precedent in other Western jurisdictions</td>
      <td>A Dutch court on Wednesday ruled that  Royal Dutch Shell  PLC is partially responsible for climate change and ordered the company to reduce its carbon emissions, a first-of-its-kind ruling that adds fresh pressure on oil-and-gas companies already facing heightened scrutiny from governments and investors.<br />The ruling, issued by the district court in The Hague and stemming from a lawsuit brought by environmental groups, found Shell must curb its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. This is in line with United Nations guidance for member states aimed at preventing global temperatures rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.<br />Lawyers and consultants said the ruling could set a precedent in other Western jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, opening oil companies to new legal jeopardy over their carbon emissions. Companies in other heavy polluting industries could also face greater environmental scrutiny, they added.<br />“This case does open the door for challenges to other energy-intensive sectors,” said Liz Hypes, an analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. Other industries that could face lawsuits include agriculture, transport and mining, all of which are already being targeted by regulators and civil society over their emissions, Ms. Hypes added.<br />The civil suit against Shell was led by the Dutch arm of Friends of the Earth, an environmental nonprofit. It alleged Shell’s production of oil and natural gas contributed to climate change, violating a so-called duty of care to those affected by it and failing to meet the company’s human-rights obligations.</td>

      <td>Before you re-emerge, consider dumping the cozy cocoon you’ve been living in for thin, curve-hugging knitwear—a more confident and seductive option</td>
      <td>BAD NEWS FOR baggy sweaters: Warm weather and reopening is moving women to break up with the faithful, nubby pullovers that provided so much sloppy comfort during lockdown. The new object of fashion’s affections? Uninhibited knit dresses, cardigans and sweaters that are thin, breathable, summer-weight and often ribbed for visual pleasure.<br />In a backlash to the anemic monotony of our isolation clothes, sensuality has emerged as a key mood this season. Among the seductive, polished knits on the market, Bottega Veneta’s merino wool tops are so slight, they look as though mere eye contact might unbutton them. Proenza Schouler makes curve-hugging dresses. Khaite proposes pairing its woolen bra with a comparatively demure, collared cardigan, and New York brand Tibi is suggesting sweaters with flirty, flesh-exposing cutouts. “We haven’t had any playfulness for a year,” said London designer Paula Gerbase, whose gauzy, almost see-through tops tease the eye. “Transparent knits allow a little bit more joy, which I’m certainly craving.”<br />Tibi founder Amy Smilovic considers her form-fitting knits ideal if you’re graduating from video-chat to in-person dating. There’s a “real desire to have things close to the body,” she said. “Giant sweaters,” she added, don’t necessarily project confidence when meeting a new Bumble match at a bar. “You don’t want to look lazy, but you do want to be comfortable.”<br />Robyn Berkley, co-founder of New York athleisure brand Live the Process, agrees. “People want that flexible feeling,” she said. Furnished with pockets and French cuffs, her label’s Tuxedo cardigan offers all the trappings of a blazer without the weighty formality.<br />Slim knits suit our collective mind-set as we transition from hibernating in sweats to dressing for social interactions. “We’re not ready to go full out in high heels and dresses,” said New York communications consultant Viktorija Svedkova Jasevice, 29. Once devoted to crisp button-ups, she’s lately relied on a sheer, low-maintenance Prada cardigan—worn with jeans or tailored trousers or over silky slip dresses—whether at home or out to dinner. “You don’t have to iron it.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Justice Department has told casino mogul Steve Wynn to register as a lobbyist in connection with his 2017 efforts to obtain a diplomatic favor long sought by Chinese authorities, and is preparing to go to court to force him to comply, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Prosecutors have gathered evidence about Mr. Wynn’s work in recent months in preparation for potential litigation if he doesn’t file any such registration, the people said. If filed, the case would be a rare civil court battle over registering under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The law doesn’t provide for civil penalties, but it gives the Justice Department the ability to seek a court order to force someone to comply.<br />In July, then-Attorney General William Barr warned that company executives who pushed policies at the behest of Chinese authorities could be required to register under the law, but the Justice Department hasn’t filed any such case.<br />The dispute relates to Mr. Wynn’s alleged efforts in the summer of 2017 to convince U.S. officials to send back to China a Chinese businessman in New York, Guo Wengui, whom Chinese authorities consider a fugitive. Mr. Guo has been accused of a range of criminal offenses, from bribery to sexual assault, all of which he has denied.<br />Mr. Wynn has long denied wrongdoing in the matter. “Steve Wynn never served as an agent or lobbyist for China or anyone else,” his attorney, Reid Weingarten, said. “He was merely a loyal messenger of information he received to our government.”</td>

      <td>Engine No. 1’s victory in one of the most expensive proxy fights ever is unprecedented setback for Exxon and CEO Darren Woods</td>
      <td>An activist investor won at least two seats on the board of  Exxon Mobil Corp. , a historic defeat for the oil giant that will likely force it to alter its fossil-fuel focused strategy and more directly confront growing shareholder concerns about climate change.<br />Exxon said Wednesday a preliminary vote count showed shareholders backed two nominees of Engine No. 1, an upstart hedge fund owning a tiny fraction of the oil giant’s stock. The final vote wasn’t tallied as of early Wednesday afternoon, and the final composition of the board was unclear. Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods was also re-elected to the board along with seven of Exxon’s candidates, while two seats were undetermined, the company said.<br />The vote culminated a pitched, monthslong battle to persuade Exxon shareholders that turned into one of the most expensive proxy fights ever. It was an enormous blow to Mr. Woods, who personally campaigned against Engine No. 1. Many viewed the vote as a referendum on Mr. Woods’ performance. Exxon lost a record $22 billion last year and was struggling to regain its status as an industry-leading profit engine even before the coronavirus pandemic crushed global demand for oil and gas.<br />Both sides feverishly made their case to investors until the last minute. Exxon delayed the closing of the voting by an hour Wednesday morning and Engine No. 1 said the company was calling investors to ask them to change their votes. In a message sent to shareholders, the fund urged them “not to fall prey to any such strategic efforts.”<br />An Exxon spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</td>

      <td>Contento, opening in Manhattan’s East Harlem neighborhood in June, is designed with accessibility in mind—from the wheelchair-friendly floor plan to the reasonably priced menu and wine list</td>
      <td>WHEN I FIRST MET Yannick Benjamin, in 2013, he was working at Le Dû Wines, a retail shop in the West Village of New York City. Until a car accident 10 years earlier left him paralyzed from the waist down, Mr. Benjamin had been a sommelier. This June, almost 18 years after the accident, Mr. Benjamin is set to open his own fully accessible restaurant, Contento, in East Harlem, New York.<br />The story behind the creation of Contento and Mr. Benjamin’s personal and professional resilience resonates deeply right now as New York and the rest of the world recover and restart. Contento had originally been scheduled to open last spring, but when the Covid-19 pandemic struck, all the work stopped. Mr. Benjamin’s response, as always, was to look for the upside. “The silver lining was that it forced me to explore my own backyard,” he said. For instance, he recently traveled to wineries in Maryland, Vermont, Virginia, Long Island and upstate New York. Those visits inspired a category on his wine list titled “East Coast Terroir.”<br />The challenge of opening a restaurant during a pandemic is just one of many trials Mr. Benjamin has faced over the years, in addition to health complications, hospitalizations and personal loss, including the death of his friend and former employer, Jean-Luc Le Dû, who died suddenly at age 52 in late 2017.<br />Mr. Le Dû had been a great supporter of the fundraising event Wine on Wheels and the foundation it benefits, Wheeling Forward, created by Mr. Benjamin with attorney Alex Elegudin. The two met at New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital when they were recovering from spinal cord injuries.<br />Mr. Benjamin met George Gallego as well at Mount Sinai, and he became a very important figure in Mr. Benjamin’s life. “He saved my life,” Mr. Benjamin stated simply. After an accident left Mr. Gallego paralyzed at age 25, he went on to become a world-class athlete, businessman, philanthropist and advocate for people with disabilities. “He inspired me to create a culture where there are more Georges,” said Mr. Benjamin. Now, Mr. Gallego is not only Mr. Benjamin’s mentor but his business partner in Contento as well.</td>

      <td>Our reviewers on vacation-ready fiction and nonfiction, along with guides to summer pleasures—and our readers weigh in on the books that capture the essence of the season.</td>
      <td>Summer is the season of leisure and breaking from routine—whether that involves a hammock on a warm afternoon in a backyard, a day at the seaside or a long-awaited trip to a cabin in the woods. We asked readers of the WSJ’s weekly Books newsletter to select books that capture the essence of summer for them. Whether reaching back to their childhoods or drawing on more recent memories of enchanting summer reads, that question produced a fascinating array of literary escapes—recommendations that go perfectly with our survey of new summer-ready fiction, plus books on golf, the great outdoors, road trips and the art of the grill.<br />For many, there’s no beach read that’s better than a truly beachy read. That might mean a family-at-the-vacation-home generational saga like J. Courtney Sullivan’s “Maine” (2011) or the coming-of-age tale Colson Whitehead sets in a Hamptons enclave of vacationing black families in “Sag Harbor” (2009). Emitom Hillsman calls out Elin Hildebrand’s Nantucket-set romance “28 Summers” (2020) for seaside escapism. But the same yearning for sea air could take the form of a memoir of the waves, experienced not from the viewpoint of the beach blanket but the dynamic perch of the surfer, as in William Finnegan’s autobiographical “Barbarian Days” (2015), recommended by Zachary Chamberlin. Life as seen from the lifeguard’s chair can seem particularly precious when it’s adjacent to the scruffy world of teens in 1980s New York, as in Jill Eisenstadt’s knowing and funny “From Rockaway” (1987), which was highlighted as a favorite by Colette Pearl, among others.<br />For some, the appeal of the summer book is the distance it takes you from the everyday. If you can’t get to an island in real life, why not travel to one in a book? Reader Elizabeth Black recommends Virginia Woolf’s “To the Lighthouse” (1927), and while Woolf’s rich psychological portraits and daring prose may not initially sound like a typical summer read, its setting amid a vividly rendered family summer retreat in the Hebrides makes it a transporting experience. Sean Benson suggests that the “perfect summer idyll” is Gerald Durrell’s “My Family and Other Animals” (1956), about the author’s eccentric childhood years—with beasts aplenty—spent on the Greek island of Corfu.<br />But for a more profound sense of escape, a tale set on a boat at sea provides a particular enchantment for many. Leigh Patten suggests Joshua Slocum’s “Sailing Alone Around the World” (1900), his light-hearted but adventure-filled account of his single-handed circumnavigation of the world. In a similarly salt-saturated vein, Richard Gollwitzer loves sailor and pilot Ernest K. Gann’s “Song of the Sirens” (1968), which tells stories from a lifetime on the water. If the open ocean doesn’t seem eventful enough a destination (or if you’re prone to seasickness) you might prefer the heady two-wheeled journey through America’s byways in Robert M. Pirsig’s “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” (1974) as recommended by Ken Walker.<br />Summer is also, of course, a season for sports, with baseball’s post-pandemic return bringing a particular celebratory air to the diamond this year. To capture the particular thrill of a great baseball summer, Seth Hirschfeld suggests a double header in the form of two David Halberstam classics, “The Summer of ’49” (1989), in which the Yankees and Red Sox battled for postwar supremacy, and “October 1964” (1994), which follows the season the upstart St. Louis Cardinals took on the Yankees’ dominance.</td>

The two women have disagreed over the need for traditional punchlines and about political correctness. Now as the series reaches the halfway point of its season, the creators say the characters are both facing the same enduring questions about what women are willing to do for laughs and who they roast in the process.<br />“In some ways these characters have so much in common. They speak the same language as funny women. On the other hand, their context is vastly different,” says Lucia Aniello, who created the series with Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky. Their work together includes the TV series “Broad City,” an influential buddy comedy about two millennial ladies in New York.</td>

Canada has vowed to levy a digital-services tax starting in 2022, regardless of whether there is a global deal among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development members on such a tax this summer.<br />The Liberal government also intends to follow Australia in trying to get digital platforms to compensate media outlets for content, and to create a new regulator to police hate speech and other harmful online activity.<br />The content proposal, unveiled last month, has generated criticism from rival politicians, law professors and net-neutrality advocates, who argue it is akin to an attack on free speech.<br />“The government is talking about picking winners and losers in the sector of free expression,” said Philip Palmer, a former senior lawyer at Canada’s justice department who three decades ago helped draft the current rules governing the broadcast sector, and who opposes the current effort.</td>

      <td>Trump was lawless himself, and violence exploded on his watch. Republican law-and-order talk is empty.</td>
      <td>From 1993 to 2019, crime steadily decreased in the U.S. Every president since Bill Clinton inherited a declining crime rate and left office with a further decline in crime rate, until Donald J. Trump came along. During Mr. Trump’s final year in office, violent crimes and homicides spiked. Yet if you tuned into Fox News, you’d draw the conclusion that the Democratic Party is opposed to law and order.<br />Crime is going to be an issue up and down the ballot in 2022, and many local politicians are already feeling the heat. Now that violent crime is on the rise, we Democrats can no longer afford to sit by passively while Republicans trumpet bellicose law-and-order talking points. If we don’t aggressively begin to own the crime issue and make Republicans respond to their own failures, we risk losing our slim majorities in Congress.<br />The modern Democratic Party is flat-out better on crime than Republicans. Mr. Trump presided over the greatest crime rise in modern American history. Now it’s time for the Democratic consultant class to stop its bed-wetting on this issue and take this case to the American people: A lawless president created the perfect storm for the crime crisis America now faces.<br />From beginning to the end, Mr. Trump’s presidency was one long crime wave. He broke laws, obstructed justice and incited violence knowing he wouldn’t be held accountable while in office. Eight of his campaign associates were put in shackles. He pardoned five of them. Corruption became the administration’s oxygen, and Mr. Trump’s stunning display of lawlessness set an example for criminals to crawl out of the shadows and believe they would never be brought to justice. It was also no coincidence that Mr. Trump presided over an all-time low in white-collar crime enforcement.<br />Crime flourished in the streets as well as the suites. The murder rate shot up 26%. Mass shootings spiked. The administration even attempted to slash community policing. Mr. Trump rambled into office inciting racism and, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, hate crimes spiked more than 20% during his presidency.</td>

      <td>Too many teachers oppose them because they’re bad for unions, not kids.</td>
      <td>The hug took me by surprise. I’d just finished speaking to a group of third-graders about my role as teachers union president when a little girl suddenly wrapped her arms around me and squeezed. Confused, I asked her why. She looked up and told me, “Because you said you care about us and you make sure we have the best teachers.” She was sweet and sincere. She had no idea my words were mostly detached from reality.<br />I’d just finished telling her and her classmates that I worked to make sure their teachers had what they needed to do their jobs—that I protected their teachers’ rights and tried to help them become the best teachers they could be. But I knew that wasn’t always the case.<br />Like many union leaders, I had relentlessly negotiated contracts that protected not only teachers’ rights, but their wrongs. As I drove home, I thought about the $10,000 my union had spent to keep a poorly performing teacher in the classroom—not because she deserved another chance, but because of a technicality.<br />My own childhood taught me the value of an education. I am the son of a Southern sharecropper who was perennially in debt no matter how hard he worked. My teachers were my inspiration and salvation. When I became a teacher, it seemed natural to become an advocate for the profession. Somewhere along the way I became more of a union leader than an educational leader.<br />The pandemic has highlighted the need to be nimble, to serve the needs of children and families where they are. We will fail our children and our teachers if we return to a pre-pandemic educational system. Unfortunately, many teacher unions want to limit access to quality education for underserved kids.</td>

      <td>An HBO Max reunion special features not only Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer but David Beckham, Malala and more.</td>
      <td>‘It’s about that time in your life when your friends are your family,” producer David Crane recalls during the unabashedly sentimental “Friends: The Reunion,” describing the “one-sentence pitch” that he and co-creator Marta Kauffman devised for their famously popular sitcom, birthed on Sept. 22, 1994. If you were living through that particular time of your life during the 10-year run of “Friends,” the show might hold the same place in your heart that the Beatles do for Boomers.<br />If you ever wanted to hear Lady Gaga’s version of “Smelly Cat” replete with gospel chorus, then “Friends: The Reunion” is certainly the show for you. And if you don’t know exactly what that means, it will still entertain. The show’s principal cast—Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, Courteney Cox, Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer—all seem very happy to be here, though Mr. Perry seems a bit more downcast than the others. Mr. LeBlanc is the most witty, charming and relaxed returnee; the rest seem virtually unchanged, though not unmoved by the circumstances.<br />Along with clips, quips and bloopers, the show features a virtual parade of familiar faces as well as total unknowns from around the globe all testifying as to how important the program was to them. As far as can be determined, neither soccer legend David Beckham nor Nobel laureate Malala was ever on “Friends,” but they’re big fans and so they are here. That Malala would have been about 7 when the “Friends” finale aired on May 6, 2004, is a testament to how the show has never really gone away and seemingly never will: The old episodes have time-traveled though reruns, VHS tapes, DVD boxed sets and their current iteration as streaming content on HBO Max—something of which this special serves as a not-uncalculated reminder.<br />The inescapable James Corden, impersonating an interviewer, poses questions of the how-does-it feel/tell-us-about-it school of journalistic inquiry during the onstage portion of the show. The awkwardness can be painful. “Do you stay in touch?” he asks, with Ms. Kudrow offering a diplomatic “not every day” and Mr. Perry muttering, “I don’t hear from anyone.” You’re not sure he’s kidding.<br />Most of the time, Mr. Corden’s role is head cheerleader, waxing adorational and introducing notables in the audience, including Mr. Crane, Ms. Kauffman and executive producer Kevin S. Bright, who provide a lot of interesting background on the creation of the show, notably the struggle to cast it. A number of the guests are “surprises,” though longtime “Friends” watchers would have been more surprised if these individuals didn’t show up. The absence of certain other folk will likely raise hackles among the fan base.</td>

      <td>The U.S. campaign against Huawei has opened the cellular-equipment market to a host of new players that previously didn’t seem to have much of a chance</td>
      <td>The U.S. government has upended the $35 billion-a-year cellular-equipment industry, ushering in a new era of competition and giving U.S. companies a shot at re-entering a sector they vacated years ago.<br />In the past five years, only China’s Huawei Technologies Co., Sweden’s  Ericsson  AB and Finland’s  Nokia Corp.  captured more than a 20% share of revenue in the wireless-equipment market, according to Dell’Oro Group, a research firm. No other competitor consistently cracked even 10%.<br />Now that landscape is changing. Pushed by Washington’s campaign to cripple Huawei over cybersecurity concerns, countries representing more than 60% of the world’s cellular-equipment market are considering or have already enacted restrictions against Huawei, says Dell’Oro Group. And to take advantage of that opening, the U.S. government—as well as governments in the U.K. and European Union—are considering financial support and other measures to boost domestic cellular-equipment makers trying to crack the three incumbents’ stranglehold on the market.<br />The result is a newly competitive market that is reminiscent of the 1990s, when bygone industry giants such as Lucent, Motorola, Nortel, Siemens and Alcatel fought for a piece of a growing telecom-equipment pie.<br />“It’s got a Wild West feel to it,” says Bill Plummer, a former Nokia and Huawei executive now working at JMA Wireless, a Syracuse, N.Y., 5G company. “We haven’t seen this since probably the eve of the dot-com bust—this dynamic and thriving competitive environment in wireless.”</td>

      <td>Buying MGM may tempt fate with regulators who feel e-commerce titan is strong enough</td>
      <td>Giving the people what they want is an old maxim in Hollywood.  Amazon.com  may be targeting the wrong people, though.<br />Amazon’s $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM Holdings announced Wednesday is a milestone deal for a few reasons. It is the e-commerce giant’s second largest ever following the $13.7 billion outlay for Whole Foods Market in 2017. It is also the biggest play to date among tech heavyweights with Hollywood aspirations. Apple Inc. and Google have spent large sums acquiring content and talent for their own streaming services, but none has yet taken over a studio and the library that goes with it.<br />MGM ranks well below major studios such as  Disney  and Warner Bros. in terms of box-office share, but it is home to several major properties such as “James Bond” and “Rocky.”<br />Yet this deal stands out as the boldest example yet of a tech giant tempting fate with lawmakers and regulators at a time when many have loudly expressed the belief that the company is already too powerful. Amazon was hit Tuesday with an antitrust suit by the District of Columbia, accusing the company of preventing sellers on its marketplace from offering better deals elsewhere.<br />Others have previously called for breakup measures, such as unwinding Amazon’s Whole Foods acquisition. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who expressed misgivings about the Whole Foods merger at the time and is now head of the Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, has proposed a bill that effectively shifts the burden of proof to large companies making acquisitions. Under that measure, such companies would need to prove their deals don’t “create an appreciable risk of materially lessening competition.”</td>

      <td>Going on vacation? You could do worse than pack “People We Meet on Vacation” (Berkley, 364 pages, $16), Emily Henry’s wry, witty tale of longtime travel buddies with emotional baggage.<br />Poppy Wright, the novel’s millennial narrator, a writer at a travel magazine, and Alex Nilsen, a high-school teacher, met on the first night of their college orientation, and it quickly became clear that the only thing they had in common was their mutual dislike.<br />Alex, as Poppy noted at the time, “is tall, gaunt and eager to see the library. I’m short and loud and hoping someone comes by and invites us to a real party. By the time we part I’m fairly confident we’ll never speak again. Apparently he feels the same way.” (In strict adherence to the conventions of the genre, the two of them turn out to be perfect for each other. Just give it 350 pages or so.)<br />Despite the unpromising start, a friendship takes root when Alex gives Poppy a ride home at the end of freshman year—they live in neighboring towns in Ohio. So begins their tradition of taking an annual summer trip together—that is, until a ghastly on-the-road falling out, then a last-ditch trip to try to turn things around. The couple’s adventures in San Francisco, New Orleans and other ports of call, told in flashback, form the spine of the book.<br />The strength of “People We Meet on Vacation” isn’t the “When Harry Met Sally”-flavored storyline, which is more than a bit protracted. Rather it’s the clever observations, the dialogue (which is laugh-out-loud funny) and, most particularly, the characters. Funny and fumbling and lovable, they’re most decidedly worth the trip.</td>

      <td>The search for the great American course, the Golden Age of Bobby Jones and a tribute to a legend.</td>
      <td>It’s rare to find a book about America these days—America writ large, America as in the United States of America—that unifies rather than divides. But Tom Coyne has managed just that in his heartfelt, rollicking ode to golf, “A Course Called America” (Avid Reader, 401 pages, $28.99).<br />Mr. Coyne describes playing golf in every state of the union, including Alaska: 295 courses, 5,182 holes, 1.7 million total yards. Along the way, he dives deep into the essence of the game—its joys, its agonies and addictions, its hold on golfers’ souls. But most of what you’ll remember after putting the book down are the people he encounters, in all their great American diversity and passion.<br />Mr. Coyne, who doubles as an English professor at St. Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, has written two previous books of a similar bent. For “A Course Called Ireland” (2009), he hiked around the perimeter of the island, carrying his golf bag, playing every links course he could find and drinking a lot of pub beer with the locals after his rounds. In “A Course Called Scotland” (2018), written after going on the wagon, a newly sober Mr. Coyne gave Scotland the same treatment, albeit with the assistance of motorized vehicles.<br />The U.S. is 56 times the size of Scotland, Ireland and Northern Ireland combined, so nailing down the logistics of Mr. Coyne’s journey was a Herculean task. Job one was sleuthing out a willing host for the private clubs he wanted to play, including every extant U.S. Open course, and coordinating a date and time to play in person with his hosts, as clubs usually require. Mr. Coyne calls this the “American golf problem,” in comparison with the British Isles, where almost every course is accessible to the public at least some of the time. Social media helps solve the problem. In fact, social media is a hero of the book. As people begin reading online about his adventure, they sign up to join him for rounds, and Mr. Coyne grows increasingly upbeat about golf’s future. He charts how a “new breed of informed practitioners uninterested in the game’s fusty status quo” are coalescing into stylish online golf communities. Players pursue the game differently from before—Instagram posting is constant, quirky equipment and nine-hole rounds are common—but with no less passion. Golf, Mr. Coyne writes, is “getting younger and smarter and more creative.”<br />But it’s not only the social-media-savvy who inspire Mr. Coyne. At Pinehurst, N.C., he meets soldiers traumatized in Afghanistan who have recovered from post-traumatic stress using golf as a therapy. In Idaho, he plays with two macho bikers sporting handlebar mustaches who, he soon surmises, rendezvous at remote golf courses to keep their romance private. In Minnesota, he listens to a golf ranger read golf poems he had written to passing players. And in Kansas he is delighted by a golf-obsessed 11-year-old girl who, as Bill Murray’s partner in a match against Mr. Coyne and Mr. Murray’s brother, Brian, dares to bust the comedian’s chops for missing a short putt. “Nice lag,” she says.</td>

      <td>As our wondrous herd lurches toward immunity, many Americans have traded their masks for traveling shoes. The book industry is right in step, offering a slew of titles showing the way to destinations great and small and offering innovative ways to get there.<br />Jeralyn Gerba and Pavia Rosati offer a comprehensive guidebook in “Travel North America (And Avoid Being a Tourist)” (Hardie Grant, 283 pages, $29.99). It begins with the dizzying observation that we live on a “furiously spinning globe” beset by potential apocalypses. No worries. Healing can be fostered if the wandering class behaves more like “travelers” than “tourists,” the latter notorious for staying in “hotels owned by large corporations” and for drinking too much bottled water. Travelers “avoid big cruise ships,” hold haggling to a minimum, and bunk in places like A Room at the Beach in Bridgehampton, N.Y., a bungalow once owned by Martha Stewart that, for all its glories, might vaporize what remains of a stimulus check far faster than Motel 6.<br />Readers hoping to undo the damage inflicted by Grubhub pizza sherpas can follow the authors’ directions to the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail or burn excess blubber by trekking to high-country huts in Colorado. Those suffering from post-pandemic stress can seek healing context at Winslow, Ariz., where Mother Nature dropped a meteor some 50,000 years ago, devastating neighborhood life forms but leaving behind a crater that makes an awesome selfie backdrop. A similar reminder that our era has not been singled out for rough treatment is found at the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles, where many a prehistoric beast met a gooey end, their agonies detailed in a pleasant museum that made the authors’ list.<br />Travelers whose artistic sensibilities were not satisfied by the work of Joe Exotic and other lockdown luminaries will find welcome relief in “101 Art Destinations in the U.S.” (Rizzoli Electa, 271 pages, $14.98). Veteran scribe Owen Phillips covers museums famous and remote, cave drawings, and even funk superstar George Clinton’s “Mothership”—an iconic spaceship-shaped stage prop—at Washington’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. Along the way Mr. Phillips supplies interesting asides. Money guy Nelson Rockefeller, as we know, made great contributions to several collections at the Metropolitan Museum in New York; the connection between art and commerce is also on display at the nearby Carlyle Hotel, which swapped accommodations for murals by artist Ludwig Bemelmans, famous for his Madeline books. In Boston, the art of art theft is acknowledged at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, whose Dutch Room displays the frames from which thieves posing as police officers sliced two Rembrandts and a Vermeer during a 1990 heist.<br />Mr. Phillips reminds us that art raises spirits—and hackles. The Battle of Gettysburg Cyclorama, which depicts Pickett’s charge, may strike some as a cautionary tale about the dangers of joining the infantry. Other observers, he writes, criticize it “for showing valor on both sides with no judgment or sign of the underlying causes for the war”—a message that might require an additional cyclorama or two. A more creative protest met Pablo Picasso’s untitled five-story steel portrait at Chicago’s Daley Plaza, unveiled in 1967. A science-fiction writer erected a giant pickle on the site to pan the piece in advance. Piling on, journalist Mike Royko wrote of the Picasso that “its eyes are like the eyes of every slum owner who made a buck off the small and the weak. And of every building inspector who took a wad from a slum owner.” In Richmond, Va., where most Confederate statuary has been removed, visitors to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts can still pose beside a full-figure statue of Caligula, the controversial Roman statesman.</td>

      <td>In June, armed young men with the latest high-tech gear are expected to descend on Beijing to shoot at their rivals.<br />Fortunately, the event is just a game with play guns. But it’s also a thriving business that stands to grow and change with the addition of fifth-generation mobile connections.<br />Esports are videogame competitions played before live and online audiences—sometimes totaling in the tens of millions—in which experienced contestants vie for cash prizes. Companies ranging from  Intel Corp.  to  Ericsson  AB say they see esports as a natural application for ultrafast 5G networks. With much faster speeds than fourth-generation technology, 5G can make a critical difference in the realism of game scenes and the action. Fast networks are needed to transfer the huge amounts of data that allow players to respond to one another’s actions and keep simulated environments realistic-looking.<br />With faster connections, there also will be potential to involve more players from different venues in a single esports competition. The higher speeds made available in mobile devices, meanwhile, will give a big boost to competitions in virtual-reality games—both in how such games are played and how audiences experience such events.<br />In virtual-reality games, headsets made by companies such as  Facebook Inc.’s  Oculus unit allow players to immerse themselves in simulated environments. In shooting games, for example, players see themselves moving through the virtual environment, and when they pull the triggers on their faux guns to shoot at virtual enemies, bursts of gunfire appear.</td>

      <td>Alphabet Inc.’s  Google and national hospital chain  HCA Healthcare Inc.  have struck a deal to develop healthcare algorithms using patient records, the latest foray by a tech giant into the $3 trillion healthcare sector.<br />Nashville, Tenn.,-based HCA, which operates across about 2,000 locations in 21 states, would consolidate and store with Google data from digital health records and internet-connected medical devices under the multiyear agreement. Google and HCA engineers will work to develop algorithms to help improve operating efficiency, monitor patients and guide doctors’ decisions, according to the companies.<br />“Data are spun off of every patient in real time,” said Dr. Jonathan Perlin, HCA’s chief medical officer. “Part of what we’re building is a central nervous system to help interpret the various signals.”<br />The deal expands Google’s reach in healthcare, where the recent shift to digital records has created an explosion of data and a new market for technology giants and startups. Data crunching offers the opportunity to develop new treatments and improve patient safety, but algorithm-development deals between hospitals and tech companies have also raised privacy alarms.<br />Google has previously reached deals with other prominent U.S. hospital systems, including St. Louis-based Ascension, that granted access to personal patient information, drawing public scrutiny. Other tech giants have struck similar deals.</td>

      <td>Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.), the former chair of the House Republican Conference, is set to be interviewed Wednesday afternoon at 12:30 p.m. ET at The Wall Street Journal’s Women, Power and Equity event.<br />Ms. Cheney is expected to be asked about how she seeks to lead the party forward in a post-Donald Trump era and the challenges for women navigating in leadership roles.<br />The lawmaker was ousted from GOP leadership earlier this month. She had clashed with senior Republicans by pushing back aggressively and publicly on Mr. Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from him. Other Republicans said her criticisms of Mr. Trump were hurting party unity.<br />Ms. Cheney has said she would continue to challenge Mr. Trump’s claims and outline a different path for the GOP. She is expected to remain in Congress and run for re-election in Wyoming, where she already faces primary challengers.<br />Also set to be interviewed at the Journal event are Reps. Nicole Malliotakis (R., N.Y.) and Marilyn Strickland (D., Wash.), two of 27 freshmen congresswomen this year. The Journal will also interview Symone Sanders, chief spokesperson and senior adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris.</td>

That figure is a cumulative total that includes spending over the past few years, and includes capital earmarked for two future U.S. battery-cell factories with Korea’s  SK Innovation Co.  The companies said last week they plan to form a joint venture.<br />Mr. Farley, who took over last fall, is scheduled to present more details during a virtual investor presentation later Wednesday to outline his plan to reverse years of declining profits.<br />The company also said it expects in 2023 to achieve an 8% operating margin, up from around 4% in recent years. It had previously pegged the 8% mark as a goal but hadn’t specified a timeline.<br />The nation’s No. 2 auto maker by sales said it has created an internal business called Ford Pro to serve commercial customers, such as the contractors, utility companies and government agencies that maintain fleets of vehicles.</td>

      <td>President must decide whether Fed chairman has right call on unemployment, inflation</td>
      <td>Few things matter more to the success of President Biden’s administration than employment and inflation, and few institutions influence those more than the Federal Reserve.<br />Which is why so much is riding on whether Mr. Biden decides in coming months to reappoint or replace its chairman, Jerome Powell, whose four-year term expires next February. Presidents going back to Ronald Reagan reappointed chairmen installed by their predecessors, nurturing the institution’s reputation for nonpartisan independence. President Trump broke that tradition by replacing Chairwoman Janet Yellen, a Democrat, after a single term, with Mr. Powell, a Republican.<br />Some on the left would like Mr. Biden to do the same and replace Mr. Powell with someone, preferably not a white man, more vocal about addressing racial disparities, combating climate change and regulating banks more tightly. Mr. Biden has no shortage of qualified candidates starting with Ms. Yellen, now his Treasury Secretary.<br />Of the Fed’s many responsibilities, two matter most: full employment and low, stable inflation. Mr. Biden’s attention is squarely on the first. His ambitious fiscal plans are partly aimed at driving unemployment down to levels that spur strong wage gains for lower- and middle-class families. It would be hard to imagine a Fed chairman less inclined to stand in the way than Mr. Powell.<br />"He has embraced the idea that many of us on the left had long maintained: low levels of unemployment disproportionately benefit those most disadvantaged in the labor market,” Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, recently wrote, urging Mr. Biden to reappoint Mr. Powell immediately.</td>

The U.S. Seventh Fleet, based in Japan, has dozens of other ships and aircraft, but the redeployment of its only available aircraft carrier represents a significant diversion away from Asia, which President Biden has called a priority for the military.<br />Mr. Biden unveiled plans last month to pull all U.S. and coalition troops out of Afghanistan by Sept. 11. U.S. officials said then that they would keep a carrier and its accompanying ships, known as a strike group, in the area to provide security while the forces are moving out of Afghanistan.<br />The aircraft carrier currently operating in the region, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, has to leave by July to return to its home port in Norfolk, Virginia. The Eisenhower has been deployed twice during the past 36 months and cannot safely extend its deployment beyond that, defense officials said.  The Eisenhower has been operating in the north Arabian Sea since April.</td>

      <td>Xiaomi has avoided the sustained U.S. pressure that hit Huawei’s smartphone business, but repeating 2020’s strong performance will be tough</td>
      <td>Chinese smartphone maker  Xiaomi  is basking in the glow of good news—or rather the lack of the sort of bad news that Huawei recently encountered. But the tech firm’s 2021 still looks challenging.<br />Xiaomi’s revenue last quarter rose 55% year over year while its gross profit grew 87%, the company said Wednesday. Xiaomi sold 49.4 million smartphones globally in the quarter, 69% more than a year earlier. Partly that was due to comparison with a low base in 2020 when Covid-19 was at its most severe in China. But Xiaomi had a phenomenal year for more important reasons: its domestic rival Huawei was hamstrung by U.S. sanctions. Xiaomi’s global smartphone market share rose from 10% in the second quarter last quarter, just before the Huawei sanctions kicked in, to 14% last quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. Huawei’s market share fell from 20% to 4% over the same period. Xiaomi also managed to sell more expensive handsets, which boosted its profit margins.<br />Although for a time it looked like Xiaomi might fall afoul of U.S. authorities as well, it now appears to have avoided that fate. The company said in an exchange filing Wednesday that a U.S. court has revoked all restrictions on the buying or holding of the company’s stock by U.S. investors. The Trump administration placed Xiaomi on a list of “Communist Chinese military companies” in January.<br />Bumper profits supercharged by Huawei’s woes are unlikely to last, however. Smartphone shipments in China have been growing strongly in recent quarters as more consumers switched to 5G smartphones. That trend will likely slow down.<br />And while Xiaomi is making inroads in markets like Latin America, it is facing tougher competition at home. Apple, vivo and OPPO have all taken up market share left by Huawei. And Honor, which was sold by Huawei to a Chinese state-led consortium last year, will soon launch new smartphones not subject to U.S. sanctions. The company confirmed its new phones will be equipped with  Qualcomm ’s  new Snapdragon 778G chips and Google services.</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko defended his handling of the diversion of a Ryanair flight over the weekend and accused Western leaders of trying to interfere in the country’s affairs, charging that they had crossed red lines in their attacks on the former Soviet state.<br />The Belarusian leader said his country was justified in asking the plane to land, heeding reports that there were explosives on board, and in doing so had averted a tragedy. He said he had acted legally to protect people’s lives.<br />“We responded adequately to the information received,” Mr. Lukashenko said in a speech to parliamentarians on Wednesday, his first comments since the Sunday incident. “How would the United States react in such a situation in view of their sad experience?”<br />European Union and U.S. leaders were swift to condemn the forced landing of the plane, which was carrying dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who was later arrested. On Monday, they agreed to impose a new round of sanctions on Belarus and ban its airlines from entering the bloc’s airspace and airports.<br />Western leaders have demanded the release of Mr. Protasevich, who became one of the lead actors behind a wave of antigovernment protests last year in the wake of Belarus’s August presidential election. Mr. Lukashenko claimed to have won in a landslide, but Western officials said the vote was neither free nor fair. Opponents have been demanding the resignation of the Belarusian leader, who has been in power since 1994.</td>

The national cabinet, or State Council, which Mr. Li chairs, said last week it would take steps to ensure adequate supply and stable prices for commodities.<br />On Sunday, six agencies including China’s competition and securities regulators summoned commodity industry representatives to warn them of a zero-tolerance approach to illegal activities like market manipulation, price-gouging and hoarding. Attendees included representatives of industry associations and commodity producers.<br />The government bodies also said they would supervise markets such as those for copper and aluminum more closely, according to a statement Monday from the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic-planning agency.<br />The moves follow a rally, fueled by a global economic rebound and supply-chain disruptions, that has lifted prices for some commodities such as copper to records.</td>

      <td>Writer Amy Merrick on resuming her passion for finding the big score. Plus: A guide to the best U.S. flea markets reopening this summer</td>
      <td>THERE WAS a time when I only used hand sanitizer at flea markets. Anointing myself with that jellied alcohol signaled that I was in the throes of delight, hunting through fields of folding tables, engaged in an anthropological study of sometimes beautiful, sometimes ugly, always filthy, discarded things. Then 2020 arrived, and with it went my beloved flea markets. The hand sanitizer, sadly, remained.<br />During a year marked with so much loss, the cancellation of my favorite pastime ranked extremely low on the tragedy scale, but I felt it bitterly all the same. The sheer pleasure of looking, the lure of the great find, the jocular social encounters all wrapped up in a single morning’s trip—I pined for them, endlessly scrolling auctions online. It was not the same.<br />My first flea market purchase came at age 6: white leather go-go boots with fringe, for a quarter. That was my first flush of the adrenaline that passionate flea marketers know. At 12, I aimed higher: a 1940s quilt made of triangles of sun-softened cotton shirting for $10. It is still in use today, if decidedly more tattered.<br />In the intervening decades, my romance with flea markets has only strengthened, and I can chart the course of my life and travels in my purchases. Armfuls of antique hemp linens from the Ecseri market in Budapest; vintage silk dresses from the Porte de Vanves in Paris; woven Welsh blankets and willow baskets from Kempton, outside London. While living in Kyoto I memorized the market schedules and headed out early, returning with a rucksack full of indigo textiles and stoneware ceramics.<br />It was the cancellation of my local annual flea market in Dublin, N.H., that stung most. I could no longer walk through the slightly sodden field—the sun barely risen, wallet full of small bills, coffee in a thermos. I couldn’t navigate rows of dealers hawking all manner of good old New England junk: braided rugs, milking stools, Windsor chairs, woven baskets—the scent of the breakfast-sandwich grill enveloping everything in a dreamy bacon haze. I missed the excited hum of the community spirit we all loved and lost.</td>

      <td>Italian prosecutors accuse three managers of deactivating emergency brake ahead of Sunday’s cable-car disaster that killed 14</td>
      <td>ROME—Italian prosecutors arrested three managers of the company whose cable car crashed in the Alps on Sunday, killing 14 of the 15 passengers, in a tragedy that shocked the country and raised fresh questions about the safety of Italy’s infrastructure.<br />The managers told investigators that the cable car’s brake had been deactivated following early faulty performance, so the cabin sped downhill and crashed when one of the cables carrying it broke, Captain Luca Geminale of the Carabinieri military police said.<br />Investigators say they don’t yet know why a cable broke shortly before the cabin reached the station, but the emergency brake should have automatically kicked in and stopped the car from sliding down the mountain. Instead, it reached a speed of around 60 miles an hour before hitting a pylon and tumbling into trees above the town of Stresa on Lake Maggiore in northern Italy.<br />The victims included an Israeli family, several Italians and an Iran-born man. The lone survivor, a five-year-old Israeli boy, is being treated at a Turin hospital for severe injuries.<br />The tragedy—which happened just as Italy was beginning to reopen tourism and leisure activities after months of restrictions to fight the Covid-19 pandemic—has quickly become a scandal. Italy has suffered other infrastructure disasters in recent years that were blamed on poor maintenance, negligence or economizing on safety, including the collapse of a highway bridge in the northern Italian port of Genoa in 2018, which killed 43 people.</td>

      <td>Alice Waters is sitting in a sunny garden in Los Angeles. She speaks with an untraceable accent that has a breathy, ethereal quality to it, likely honed by time spent during her early adulthood in London, where she trained to be a Montessori school teacher, and throughout France and Turkey, where she first became interested in food.<br />Fifty years ago, after returning stateside, she opened Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, establishing her slow-food ethos. In 1995, she founded the Edible Schoolyard program at the Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School in Berkeley, which has a one-acre organic garden and kitchen classroom where students grow and prepare food on-site. At 77 years old, she continues to publicly advocate her belief in sustainable production and cooking, releasing her latest book this June, We Are What We Eat: A Slow Food Manifesto. In Waters’s ideal world, every family would have a World War I–style victory garden to grow their own food. Schoolchildren, she believes, should be fed organic, healthy meals, weaning them off of the fast food that make up most school lunches. “It’s a crime to have children, before they’re 6, addicted,” she says, of the excess fat, sugar and salt in so many American kids’ diets. She sees the Covid-19 death toll as partially a consequence of American obesity, too.<br />California, she hopes, will be at the center of a progressive, nationwide change in how we think about food. “We have to be deliberate in the way that we teach the values of stewardship and nourishment and community and diversity and equity to the next generation,” she says. “And what better place than the public school system?”<br />2021 is the 50th anniversary of Chez Panisse. What successes have you seen in your slow-food ethos? What still needs to get done?<br />Something really needs to get done right now because we have forgotten about public education in this country. The fast-food industry has come in there and brought the values of fast food into the school system. That’s what my manifesto is really about. It’s showing how fast food isn’t just about food that’s not nourishing, it’s taught us a set of values that has destroyed our humanity and our planet. If we change the food [in schools], wow, what an economic engine. We can give to Black, brown farmers, the whole nine yards. And for 50 years, [Chez Panisse has] been buying food directly from the farmers. No middleman. The values come right through the kitchen door. Having the Edible Schoolyard for 25 years at a middle school in Berkeley with [about] a thousand kids and 22 different languages spoken, I know for sure one thing: that when they experienced math in the garden and history in the kitchen classroom, where they’re cooking the food from India and eating the chickpea curry, they’re coming back to their senses; they’re touching and tasting. We live right now in a sensorially deprived world. We aren’t tasting anymore. We aren’t listening carefully.</td>

It is also the most suitable site in northern Australia for a major naval base and provides the country’s closest route to disputed South China Sea waters.<br />Darwin Port routinely supports exercises of the Australian defense forces and hosts visits by Australian and foreign navies, according to the port’s annual reports.</td>

The STB’s review of the proposed trust is the first of a lengthy two-step regulatory process that requires the regulator to ensure that major railroad mergers are in the public interest and enhance competition.<br />Canadian National’s main rail lines travel across Canada and south into the U.S. through such major hubs as Chicago, Detroit and New Orleans. Kansas City Southern routes extend from Illinois to Southern Mexico. The two railroads operate nearby routes from Baton Rouge to New Orleans that largely ship chemical products. The railways share some customers on the route region.<br />“We believe our early commitment to eliminating the minimal rail overlap and to laying out the case for a CN-KCS combination should allow the STB to approve our voting trust,” Canadian National’s Chief Executive Jean-Jacques Ruest said.<br />Canadian National would sell the Louisiana section if its proposed merger is approved by the STB.</td>

      <td>Vanita Gupta, Justice Department’s No. 3, says fostering trust between police and communities is effective way to stem violent crime</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal overhauls of local police departments bolster the fight against violent crime, Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said, countering criticism from some officers who say the national outcry over police conduct is already sapping their morale as departments across the U.S. see rises in gun violence.<br />The Justice Department’s broad civil rights investigations aim to root out patterns of unconstitutional conduct such as excessive force or racial discrimination. They can end in a legal settlement known as a consent decree forcing a police department to make changes overseen by a court-appointed monitor.<br />Critics of the federal probes, including some police officers and their unions, say they can make officers less proactive, leading to more crime, especially when officers are already on edge given the past year’s nationwide demonstrations over the killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans by police.<br />“Our ability to fight violent crime and to keep communities safe is inherently tied in with the ability for law enforcement to have the trust of the communities that they serve,” said Ms. Gupta, the Justice Department’s No. 3 official. “When people trust law enforcement and recognize its legitimate authority to enforce the law, that’s when we can actually do the most effective violence-prevention work.”<br />Her comments come as the Justice Department and local law-enforcement agencies are anticipating a rise in violence this summer. Shootings and homicides in most big U.S. cities are up this year again after climbing in 2020. Police are bulking up patrols and implementing other tactics to head off a crime wave as the easing of the pandemic prompts more people to venture into public spaces.</td>

      <td>Regional leaders want extension to move closer to when Summer Olympics are set to begin</td>
      <td>TOKYO—Japanese leaders moved to extend a state of emergency in Tokyo and other major cities for several weeks into June, citing persistently high coronavirus infections with the Summer Olympics set to start in less than two months.<br />Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike asked the central government on Wednesday for the extension beyond the current end date of May 31. Other regional leaders have made similar requests, and the government is expected to make the move official later this week. Local media said the extension is likely to go through June 20, which would be just 33 days before the scheduled day of the Olympic opening ceremony.<br />The latest state of emergency in Tokyo started April 25. Infections have come down but not as quickly as hoped. The U.K. variant known as B.1.1.7, which is considered more contagious, is now dominant in Tokyo, and the variant found in India called B.1.617 has also been detected in Japan. On Wednesday, more than 4,500 new infections were identified.<br />Gov. Koike said of the state of emergency: “Lifting it now would risk a resurgence of infections soon.”<br />The current measures are less restrictive than lockdowns that have been imposed in some parts of the world during the pandemic. Trains operate normally and people can move about freely, but stores selling nonessential goods have been asked to close, and most restaurants are either shutting down at 8 p.m. or closing altogether.</td>

      <td>Those who saw Vimeo’s debut as disappointing aren’t considering how far its valuation has come</td>
      <td>If you got the sense that  Vimeo ’s  initial public offering didn’t go so well, that would be because there wasn’t one.<br />After trading on thin volume on a when-issued basis last week, the video hosting and sharing platform was officially spun off from its parent company  IAC/InterActiveCorp  on Tuesday, ending its first day as an independent, publicly traded company with a market value of nearly $8.4 billion.<br />That was less than the high of more than $10.6 billion implied by last week’s conditional transaction volume, which could suggest a disappointing debut. But given that volume was so light heading into the spinoff, the more relevant comparison is probably with its recent private financing: Vimeo’s current market value is over $2 billion more than its valuation following a January fundraising and three times what it was valued at just six months ago.<br />So is Vimeo now on sale or overvalued? J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Carpenter’s pre-spinoff valuation analysis had Vimeo at about $9 billion, implying its true value lies somewhere between where it was indicated last week and where it is trading now. Using his revenue estimates, Vimeo ended Tuesday at less than 16 times enterprise value to forward sales.<br />Compare that with  Slack Technologies ,  a pandemic beneficiary that offers a freemium model not unlike that of Vimeo. Following a share-price surge in November, Slack’s stock has traded sideways for the past several months, settling into a valuation of just less than 19 times forward sales. That makes sense: Early last year, as the pandemic gripped the U.S., Slack was growing sales at nearly 50% year-over-year. But Wall Street estimates that growth has since decelerated significantly and should slow further to less than 24% growth for the quarter ending in April 2022.</td>

To fund the transition, its companies have embraced green bonds, which are typically designed to fund climate-friendly initiatives like switching to alternative energy from fossil fuels.<br />The guidelines for green investments are squishy in many places, and in China’s domestic bond market they are more so. The Chinese market is regulated by several agencies, which apply different rules on the uses of the cash and disclosure. In some cases, up to half of the proceeds from onshore green bonds can be used to fund a business’s day-to-day cash needs instead of climate-related projects. The equivalent international maximum is 5%.<br />“This could increase the risk of greenwashing, where the true environmental benefit of the transaction is overstated,” said Lori Shapiro, a sustainable finance analyst at S&P Global Ratings.<br />Still, the Chinese government has in other ways tightened standards for the use of proceeds from green bonds, for example by vetoing coal-related deals. And investors are lining up to provide capital to help Chinese companies reduce their carbon emissions, just as they are doing in the U.S. and Europe.</td>

      <td>U.S. households from a range of incomes are buying more life-insurance policies than in years past.<br />The number of life-insurance policies sold jumped 11% in the first quarter from a year earlier, the biggest gain since 1983, according to the industry research firm Limra. The boost extends the sales increases that began last year as deaths related to Covid-19 led many consumers to buy coverage.<br />As the number of policies sold climbed, the average death benefit shrank by 4% to $270,000. The decline indicates that the industry sold more policies to households with smaller incomes, said David Levenson, Limra’s chief executive.<br />“It implies that we are reaching a larger percentage of the 102 million uninsured and underinsured Americans who believe they need coverage or need additional coverage,” he said, citing Limra research. The firm calculates that many of these people are in households earning less than $100,000 annually.<br />The $270,000 average death benefit reflected sales across all forms of distribution, including company agents. The decrease was more dramatic for sales through insurers’ online platforms, direct-mail efforts and call centers. For that subset, the average death benefit fell 19% to $70,000 in the first quarter from a year earlier, partly reflecting younger people who buy online.</td>

      <td>A flaw in the 125-year-old Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of its main charms</td>
      <td>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 125 years old, and some people consider it an anachronism. Yet for all its supposed drawbacks, it has been a pretty good measure of the stock market. One reason might be that, unlike some of its upstart rivals, measuring the market is all that it seeks to do.<br />With the exception of the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which was created a dozen years earlier, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the longest-running index in the world. Since its start in 1896, it has put on a prodigious performance, rising from 40.94 to 34312.46, or 83,712%, a testament to how good an investment U.S. stocks have been over the long haul.<br />The Dow is an oddly constructed measure of the market, though. When Charles Dow, the founding editor of The Wall Street Journal, first put it together, he simply added up the prices of its 12 original components. It is a bit different these days, with the sum of the prices of its 30 components divided by a divisor, but the same issue arises. The higher a stock’s price is, the more weight it carries in the index. Thus  UnitedHealth Group ’s  stock, with a price of $413.05, accounts for 2718 of the Dow’s 34312 points, while Apple’s stock, at $126.90, counts for just 835. But Apple carries a stock market capitalization of $2.1 trillion, marking it as the largest company by market value in the world, compared with $390 billion for UnitedHealth Group.<br />More recently constructed stock market indexes take a company’s size into account. For most of its history, for example, the S&P 500 was weighted by market capitalization, moving in 2005 to float adjustment, where only the value of shares available for public trading are counted. Inclusion in the Dow is also more arbitrary than in size-weighted indexes, and it can be years before what have become very large companies are selected for addition. Meanwhile, some has-beens have hung on until the brink of bankruptcy.<br />Yet the Dow and the S&P 500 have had strikingly similar trajectories. Over the past 30 years, for example, each has returned, with dividends reinvested, about 11% annually. And, let’s face it, when normal Americans are asked how the market did today, they are as likely to answer in S&P 500 percentage points as they are to answer questions about how hot it is out there in Celsius. Agree with it or not, the Dow, like Fahrenheit, is the standard.</td>

      <td>Chinese companies have a head start using a cellular standard that the U.S. only recently adopted</td>
      <td>It has been more than two years since people started being able to talk to each other over 5G networks. Now cars can use 5G technology to talk to each other, too.<br />But the business could develop into another source of U.S.-China competition. Chinese companies have been working longer on such vehicle communications based on advanced cellular technology, using a standard the U.S. embraced only last year, and they hope to take the lead in global markets. The U.S. and its allies, meanwhile, are cautious about using Chinese communications equipment.<br />The use of 5G in car-to-car communication is still in its infancy. But it has the potential to make driving safer, more convenient and eventually autonomous. Planners describe a world where smartcars tell one another where they are and where they are headed, preventing accidents. Pedestrians could be protected as well by signals through their phones. And traffic lights and road signs could relay real-time information to prevent congestion.<br />In a few Chinese cities, “customers are already using the technology to receive red-light warnings and other notifications,” says  Ford Motor Co.  spokesman Wesley Sherwood. “We believe there is great potential for the technology globally.”<br />It is likely to take a while for industry players and local governments to build out systems supporting car-to-car 5G communication and address security issues such as the risk of hackers disrupting car communications. The ultimate application—a purely autonomous network of cars coordinating among themselves—remains a distant vision.</td>

      <td>Railways are using the gas to clean up diesel routes. As predictable customers, they can help bring down the costs of green hydrogen for other sectors.</td>
      <td>For all the buzz about hydrogen trucks and planes, railways provide the most immediate test case for the rollout of a clean-energy technology that has electrified policy makers and markets alike.<br />Investors got very excited about the potential of hydrogen as a sustainable fuel last year, but have taken a breather in recent months—as they have with other speculative technology themes. The fact remains that, for many industries, so-called green hydrogen produced using renewable power needs about a decade of scaling up and rising carbon prices to make it competitive.<br />Yet that isn’t the case for rail transport. Hydrogen-powered trains built by France’s  Alstom  have already carried passengers over 110,000 miles on trial operations in Europe. The total lifetime cost of ownership is already comparable for trains running on diesel, hydrogen fuel cells or electrified lines, according to a report by consulting firm Roland Berger.<br />Hydrogen is best seen as a substitute for dirty diesel, still used on about half of Europe’s rails and most in the U.S. The gas is particularly useful on routes that aren’t busy enough to give priority to overhead electrification, but are too long for batteries alone. Alstom’s hydrogen trains are new, but existing diesel ones can also be retrofitted.<br />The technology faces the classic chicken-and-egg conundrum: Suppliers hesitate to build the big clean-production facilities needed to bring down costs until demand is more certain, while most customers are waiting for lower prices before switching fuels. Trains can help unblock the market because they offer an unusually predictable, long-term source of demand. Government incentives will also accelerate development.</td>

Though federal and state data indicate drug overdoses and abuse have risen during the pandemic, Quest officials say that isn’t captured in their data because many overdose victims likely weren’t subject to workplace drug testing last year.<br />Drug tests often occur for new-hire candidates, as part of random-testing programs or following an accident or suspicions of drug use.<br />Positive marijuana tests have climbed among American workers as more states have allowed marijuana for medical and recreational use in recent years. Seventeen states have passed legalization measures, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures—including, most recently, New York, New Jersey, Virginia and Arizona.</td>

But in certain cases, a broker will show an unlisted property to a small circle of potential buyers more exclusively, often in hope of getting a deal done quickly.<br />These private sales are known as pocket listings, or whisper listings. They have been around for many years. But they are on the rise now even though the National Association of Realtors adopted a rule last year aimed at discouraging their use following complaints from some of its members.<br />The new NAR policy requires agents to add listings to their local database within a business day of publicly advertising the listing. But there is a notable exemption: Listings can still be kept off the database if they are only shared within one brokerage, called an “office exclusive.”<br />Pocket listings accounted for 3% of sales on average in the year ended in March, up from 2.6% of sales in the year ended in March 2020 and 2.5% in the year ended in March 2019, according to an analysis by brokerage  Redfin Corp.

The industry lobbyists have told the governments, in meetings and phone calls, that a waiver wouldn’t address shortages any time soon, while straining raw material supplies, the people said.<br />Vaccine makers have also rolled out pledges to deliver more doses to developing countries, which have pressed for the waiver.<br />Industry lobbyists have met with Biden administration officials to argue for alternative actions, the people said. And the industry representatives have been lobbying members of Congress to pressure the Biden administration to reverse its support of the waiver, according to the people and a lobbyist email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The World Trade Organization has the authority to grant drug-patent waivers, if all 164 member countries agree, and the organization is scheduled to hold a ministerial conference starting in November.</td>

Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Rep. Maxine Waters of California, are expected to press the executives to commit to supporting minority communities, including by investing in smaller financial firms, such as minority depository institutions.<br />“The pandemic exposed several frailties in the economy and financial system, including pervasive racial inequalities, unequal access to traditional banking products and services and unaddressed systemic risks threatening U.S. financial stability,” staff for Ms. Waters wrote in a memo to the committee Monday.<br />Republicans are expected to ask banks whether they are going too far in their stated support for “stakeholder capitalism.” Mr. Dimon led a group of executives who in 2019 said corporate decisions should take all stakeholders——employees, customers and society at large——into account.</td>

Other investors include Union Square Ventures, Version One Ventures and  Microsoft Corp.’s  Climate Innovation Fund.<br />The deal is the latest in the booming business of paying forest owners not to cut down trees but instead lease standing timber as carbon sponges to companies that aim to eventually operate without adding carbon to the atmosphere. Last year oil giant  BP  PLC bought a controlling stake in Finite Carbon, an NCX rival.<br />“This isn’t philanthropy,” Mr. Benioff said in an interview. “This is an actual use of capitalism to create greater sustainability.”<br />Mr. Benioff said his personal venture firm has done well wagering about $1 billion on technology companies, but that it recently decided to invest aggressively in sustainability businesses. NCX is his firm’s first such wager, he said, on the belief that big companies will face increasing pressure from investors, customers and regulators to offset emissions that they cannot eliminate.</td>

      <td>Facebook Inc.’s  WhatsApp said it filed a lawsuit in India to stop new government rules that would require the company to trace users’ encrypted messages, escalating a battle over online speech between American tech firms and the South Asian nation’s ruling party.<br />The messaging service, by far the largest in India, said in a statement that it filed the suit late Tuesday with the New Delhi High Court. The company has argued that the new rules violate Indian law because tracing individuals’ messages would violate their fundamental right to privacy.<br />WhatsApp’s suit comes as a 90-day grace period for compliance with strict new rules from India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology expires. Those rules grant the Indian government sweeping powers to remove content that undermines national security, public order and “decency or morality” and require communications platforms like WhatsApp to be able to trace content back to its creator. In the event that tech companies fail to promptly comply with the government requests, the law says, company employees in India can be held criminally liable.<br />India’s government has come under fire from opposition groups for using such tactics to stifle online criticism over its handling of farmer protests and a surge in Covid-19 cases that has devastated the country in recent weeks.<br />In a statement on its website, WhatsApp said complying with the traceability requirement would force it to break the encryption used to protect communications between its users and “severely undermine” their privacy. Having to track and store such records would be technically inefficient, the company said, and could result in innocent people being investigated by law enforcement.</td>

It takes only a simple majority to pass a disapproval resolution, though it would take a two-thirds majority in each chamber to override a presidential veto.<br />Republicans and many Democrats have largely supported the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Israel has a right to defend itself. This month, Israel and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza fought an 11-day war that claimed the lives of more than 250 people, mostly in Gaza, according to the United Nations and Israeli officials.

      <td>The major leagues shouldn’t resort to rule changes to prop up batting averages.</td>
      <td>‘There is ample evidence that the public is getting a wee bit tired of all these ‘pitchers duels,’ ” sportswriter Bob Addie noted in 1968. The following year, Major League Baseball lowered the mound and shrank the strike zone to make things easier for batters. This season pitchers are dominating again—in fact, more than ever.<br />There have already been six no-hitters (seven if you count a shortened seven-inning game). The New York Yankees’ Corey Kluber no-hit the Texas Rangers on May 19; the night before, the Detroit Tigers’ Spencer Turnbull did it to the Seattle Mariners.<br />It’s the first time baseball had six no-hit games before June, and the season-long record is eight, set in 1884. It’s not an issue of unprecedented skill. Mr. Turnbull had the distinction only two years ago of being the Major Leagues’ losingest pitcher that season, with 17 losses. His turnaround, dramatic in its own right, reflects a bigger issue for baseball: Strikeouts are way up, batting averages are down, and it’s bad for business.<br />In Mr. Turnbull’s historic game, the losers struck out nine times, but the winning Tigers struck out 12 times themselves. That same night the San Francisco Giants beat the Cincinnati Reds despite striking out 17 times, while the Tampa Bay Rays and Baltimore Orioles combined for 27 strikeouts, and the Colorado Rockies and San Diego Padres totaled 29. The Atlanta Braves had a rough night, striking out 15 times against the New York Mets, so you’d think the team’s ace, Jacob deGrom, who has recorded 65 strikeouts this season, must have been on the mound. No, the Mets did it with an army of seven other pitchers.<br />The reasons for the pitching surge are numerous but clear. Pitchers are better conditioned and stronger, to the point that 100-mile-an-hour fastballs are common. They are also pitching fewer innings a game—relief pitchers often take over after only five or six innings—meaning they can throw as hard as possible without worrying about pacing themselves.</td>

      <td>Preschool and paid family leave are investments in the future in a way tax cuts for the rich aren’t.</td>
      <td>Do you remember supply-side economics? That’s the doctrine that claimed that lowering taxes (especially on the wealthy) would cause a gusher of growth and bring in more new revenue than it lost.<br />It wasn’t true, as the Reagan and Bush tax cuts demonstrated, according to research conducted by William G. Gale and Andrew A. Samwick for the Brookings Institution. Early returns on the Trump tax cuts show they have done little to stimulate growth as well. But certain supply-side policies really could be counted on to augment aggregate supply and increase output. Some of them were even tax cuts. There was good reason to believe, for example, that making depreciation deductions for business equipment and machinery more generous—part of the 2017 tax law—would boost investment and enhance the capital stock. In fact, the results look disappointing. The share of investment moved up, but only a little.<br />But many of the most promising supply-side policies involve government spending, including investment in physical infrastructure like roads, bridges, ports and airports.<br />The argument for more public investment is essentially the same as the argument for more private investment: If the returns are high enough, future benefits outweigh upfront costs, leaving some “profit” to the investor. All such arguments are strengthened by today’s superlow interest rates, which reduce the cost of capital. Now is the time to invest in the future—both in the private sector and in the public sector.<br />Selecting the right projects, however, is crucial. This means not limiting ourselves to physical investments like factories and roads, because investments in human capital offer many of the highest returns. Fortunately, much of President Biden’s American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan pushes in that direction.</td>
