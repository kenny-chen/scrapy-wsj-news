      <td>WASHINGTON—Iran has sent arms and dispatched paramilitary operatives to help Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro maintain his hold on power, the top U.S. military commander for Central and South America said Wednesday.<br />“We see a growing Iranian influence in there,” Adm. Craig Faller, the head of the U.S. Southern Command, told reporters, citing the “alarming and concerning” presence of military personnel from the elite Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Tehran has used the force to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other foreign allies and proxies.<br />Iran’s and Venezuela’s missions to the United Nations didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.<br />Iran is just one U.S. adversary backing the embattled Venezuela leader. Thousands of Cubans have been “basically owning” the country’s intelligence service and guard force that protects Mr. Maduro, Adm. Faller said. Hundreds of Russians have also been instrumental in providing support to “keep key elements of Maduro’s military just ready enough,” he added.<br />Adm. Faller’s comments on Iran come amid rising tensions between Washington and Tehran and represent a rare instance in which a senior U.S. military official has publicly accused Iran of shipping arms to Venezuela.</td>

      <td>Regarding Dr. Joseph Ladapo’s “Too Much Caution Is Killing Covid Patients” (op-ed, Nov. 25): In my opinion, he is correct. What he doesn’t mention is that the reason we physicians are reluctant to use these drugs is the lack of tort reform that would give us some protection from liability if later in the process there were a problem with the chosen treatment. These organizations are rightfully fastidious about requiring irrefutable data. Like most government agencies they move at a glacial pace. They produce algorithms that lawyers will use in court and most juries will follow in reaching a verdict. Algorithms are guidelines, not rules.

Leshner, D.O., FACC<br />Newtown, Pa.<br /><br />Physicians do want to see at least reasonable evidence that drugs help patients with the diseases for which they are prescribed, but it is incorrect to state that “certainty” is always required. It is true that the FDA requires “the totality of scientific evidence available” to grant full marketing approval for new drugs, but it also has the ability during the pandemic to grant emergency-use authorization to drugs for which it is “reasonable to believe” may be effective. That status has been granted (and in the case of hydroxychloroquine, withdrawn) for several drugs during the Covid-19 pandemic.</td>

What is the source for such a statement? Based on my experience as a high-school teacher, few of the drug users in their teen years are “drug dealers.” They are constant consumers, many on a daily basis, of stimulants of any kind. Two grams of cocaine is easily quartered for four classmates to afford a half-gram each, plenty to get amped up, behind some brewskis, especially for diminutive teen girls. None of the group is “a dealer” in the sense Mr. Fallon proffers his straw man; they are end-users for the dealers.<br />Oregon’s abandonment of its youth to the drug subculture, in looming years of turmoil and despair, will show in time that: “As the twig is bent, so is the tree is inclined.” Can Oregon not see the forest for the trees?<br />J.

Bean Inc., Hot Topic Inc., Newegg Inc. and  Macy’s Inc.,  according to an internal message viewed by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by UPS workers in different regions. “No exceptions,” the message said.<br />The move comes during a holiday season when retailers are increasingly dependent on delivery companies to move online orders, as store traffic has plummeted during the coronavirus pandemic—a dynamic that has shifted power significantly. UPS and rival  FedEx Corp.  have raised prices and promised to hold merchants to volume agreements.<br />The temporary limits, which some drivers say they haven’t seen during previous holiday seasons, are a sign that UPS is metering the flow of packages into its network to preserve its performance during one of the busiest shipping weeks of the year. The National Retail Federation estimated that online shopping jumped 44% over a recent five-day stretch that included Black Friday and Cyber Monday.<br />A UPS spokesman, without commenting on any customer-specific directive, said the company will pick up packages from customers whose demand exceeded allocated space once more capacity becomes available.</td>

It worked for Mayor Bill de Blasio on gun control in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. City of New York but not for Gov. Andrew Cuomo in Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo. So much for that legal gamesmanship with vital constitutional issues.<br />Unfortunately for Gov. Cuomo in the diocese case, the makeup of the Supreme Court changed and he now has to dine on the proverbial crow despite his dismissive attitude about the court’s decision. Attempting to render the central issue in the case moot by withdrawing the offensive action will no longer be tolerated when a strong constitutional insult is involved. From the main unsigned opinion to the concurring opinions, the majority has made clear it will no longer tolerate the offensive attempt to dodge the crucial constitutional issue. The temporary injunction handed down by the Supreme Court was very important and clips Gov. Cuomo’s ability to promulgate offensive orders unreasonably restrictive of religious rights. All states take notice. Also, Justice Brett Kavanaugh has recently given notice that the Second Amendment issues may soon be revisited.<br />Christopher R. Wood<br />Chester, N.J.<br /></td>

It was the second such attack by bank robbers in Brazil in two days.<br />Carrying military-style weapons, the gang of about 15 men descended on Cametá, a sleepy riverside city of 134,000 people in the Amazon on Tuesday night, killing one resident and injuring another in the 2½-hour attack.<br />“Cametá had never seen something like this,” said Mauricio Melo Mendes Monteiro, the head of the city’s military police force in Pará state.<br />The siege came a day after a gang of 30 heavily armed bank robbers invaded the small city of Criciuma more than 2,000 miles to the south, leaving cash scattered on the city’s streets as they fled the scene. Security experts said it was unlikely to be the same gang, but said it wasn’t clear if they are connected.<br />In Tuesday night’s raid, armed men first targeted Cametá’s military police station, preventing the officers from leaving while the rest of the gang broke into a bank.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Republicans signaled opposition to stripping social-media companies of liability protections as part of an annual defense-policy bill, pushing forward with the legislation despite President Trump’s threat to veto it unless they take that step.<br />Mr. Trump on Tuesday said he would veto the defense legislation if it didn’t repeal Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which gives companies broad immunity for the content they publish from users on their sites. The defense bill includes a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops and authorizes $740 billion for military and national security programs next year. It has passed Congress every year for decades with bipartisan support.<br />Sen. Jim Inhofe (R., Okla.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said a repeal of the social-media immunities wasn’t in the defense bill. Mr. Inhofe said he told Mr. Trump that he opposed including a repeal of Section 230 in the legislation because it “has nothing to do with the military.”<br />“I agree with his sentiments,” Mr. Inhofe said. “We ought to do away with 230. But you can’t do it in this bill. That’s not a part of the bill.”<br />Mr. Trump had previously threatened to veto the defense bill if it included language renaming military bases named after Confederate commanders. Mr. Inhofe said Tuesday that a measure from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) to rename those bases would also be included in the legislation.</td>

      <td>“SO, THIS RECIPE has a back story,” said Matt Kelly, chef-owner of the Spanish restaurant Mateo Tapas, in Durham, N.C. His friend, a North Carolina-based chef who hails from New Orleans, asked Mr. Kelly to do a special dinner. This recipe resulted. A tribute to the chefs’ friendship, “fideuà jambalaya” is a cross between a Catalan fideuà and a jambalaya from New Orleans.<br />Like a paella, but made with toasted pasta bits rather than rice, fideuà typically calls for ultra-fine fideo noodles, but you can also break angel hair pasta into stubby pieces and toast those. The pasta then simmers in a jambalaya-like base of tomatoes, chicken, chorizo, ham, peppers and onions. A generous spoonful of creole seasoning provides kick. (Mr. Kelly favors the Emeril’s Essence brand.) Once the noodles absorb most of the stew’s liquid, the pan slides into the oven to crisp. “You get this great crust on the bottom and browned noodles on top,” said Mr. Kelly. “You want to serve (and cook) this with a cold beer.”<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. economy’s recovery picked up to a “modest or moderate” pace this fall, while growth began to slow in November in parts of the Midwest and Northeast as coronavirus cases proliferated, a Federal Reserve report said Wednesday.<br />The Fed’s periodic compilation of anecdotes from business contacts, known as the Beige Book, said the expansion continued in most of the central bank’s 12 districts across the country. But four regional Fed branches reported “little or no growth,” and four noted that activity began to slow in early November.<br />“Firms’ outlooks remained positive; however, optimism has waned” the report said. “Many contacts cited concerns over the recent pandemic wave, mandated restrictions (recent and prospective), and the looming expiration dates for unemployment benefits and for moratoriums on evictions and foreclosures.”<br />The Fed’s previous Beige Book report characterized economic growth in the early fall as at a “slight to modest” pace.<br />Banks reported deterioration in loan portfolios—particularly commercial lending to retail, hospitality and leisure businesses—and expectations of an uptick in delinquencies became more widespread, the Beige Book added.</td>

They discussed what would become a principle of this season’s thorny finish: the NFL’s long-held obsession with competitive fairness had to go by the wayside.<br />That decision came home to roost over a surreal week that began on Thanksgiving with the postponement of a marquee game; continued on Sunday with one team playing without a quarterback; and concluded with an unusual Wednesday game that featured another team in the midst of a widespread outbreak.<br />“Health and medical decisions have and will always take precedence over competitive considerations,” commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday.<br />His remarks came just two hours before the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers were set to kickoff a game that had been postponed three times because the Ravens continued to register new positive tests for more than a week. The outbreak left the Ravens to play against the NFL’s last undefeated team without MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson, their top two running backs and a host of other starters.<br />The Ravens-Steelers game was supposed to be played on Thanksgiving night, until the cases forced a postponement until Sunday, and then Tuesday and then Wednesday. It wasn’t even confirmed that the game would proceed until shortly after noon Wednesday, just hours before kickoff.</td>

The Senate voted 50-45 to clear a final procedural hurdle before Mr. Waller’s confirmation vote, which is likely to occur Thursday.<br />Mr. Waller, whose term would run through January 2030, has attended meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee this year in his capacity at the St. Louis Fed.

From big-budget movies to lure families over Christmas, to serious-minded films to attract award nominations, they’re appearing on digital platforms, often at the same time (or soon after) they debut in theaters.<br />It’s a tradeoff for filmmakers who know fewer people will see their movies in the ideal setting they had envisioned. “The movie plays much better on a big IMAX screen,” says director Patty Jenkins, whose “Wonder Woman 1984” is hitting theaters and IMAX screens wherever they’re open on Christmas Day, the same time it arrives in living rooms on HBO Max. “Certainly the experience is far better the bigger the TV and the better the sound. It hurts a little bit to think of people watching it on their phone, but they do inevitably anyway.”<br />Even with concerns about the future of the theatrical experience, there is convenience—and a broad selection of projects from some of Hollywood’s biggest talents.

The SBA had previously issued some detailed information for PPP loans above $150,000, though the bulk of the program’s loans were smaller than that.<br />The new data show that 609 companies received the program’s maximum loan amount of $10 million. Such a loan size would indicate a firm had a larger number of employees, since borrowers generally received funding that amounted to roughly two and half times their pre-pandemic average monthly payroll.<br />The data offer the most detailed look yet at the government’s signature coronavirus relief effort for small businesses, just as lawmakers again consider whether to renew the initiative. The program, which started in April, had issued more than five million loans totaling $525 billion when it closed in August.<br />The data also signal the difficulty of tracking borrower information in a massive program where the responsible agency didn’t issue loans directly. Financial institutions processed PPP borrower applications and funded and disbursed the loans, which are backed by the SBA.</td>

They were made to big investors such as  BlackRock Inc.  and banks such as  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and  JPMorgan Chase  & Co.<br />“Our standing approach right now is to continue those calls,” Mr. Lane said in an interview with Reuters published Wednesday on the ECB’s website.<br />“It’s a structured, systematic approach where we rotate across different types of ECB watchers,” Mr. Lane said. “It’s also true that we should always review and keep in mind our communication policy.”</td>

      <td>Conflict in the north of Africa’s second-most-populous nation is spreading across borders, threatening stability in a strategic region</td>
      <td>Long-simmering tensions between Ethiopia’s federal government, led by Nobel Peace Prize-winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, and defiant authorities in its northern Tigray region have erupted into a military confrontation. Hundreds of civilians have died, while tens of thousands have sought refuge in Sudan from airstrikes, as the conflict threatens to further destabilize the strategic Horn of Africa region.<br />Ethiopian ground troops and jet fighters have bombed targets across Tigray, battling the provincial government of the country’s most northern region, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, or TPLF. On Nov. 28, government forces claimed to have taken control of the Tigrayan capital of Mekelle, home to 500,000 civilians and thousands of battle-hardened TPLF fighters who had dug trenches and blown up bridges to halt the advance of federal troops. Mr. Ahmed praised Ethiopian forces for restoring order in Mekelle and said his troops had taken great care to avoid civilian casualties.<br />The government troops appear to have faced little resistance. TPLF fighters have likely melted into the civilian population and hide-outs elsewhere in the state, where regional analysts and Western diplomats say they are preparing to mount an armed insurgency. The TPLF has pledged to never surrender and to make Tigray “hell” for the Ethiopian government. The Tigrayan authorities said Nov. 28 that they had shot down an Ethiopian warplane, and local television showed footage of a man it said was the pilot.<br />Tensions between Ethiopia’s federal government in Addis Ababa and the TPLF have been building since Mr. Ahmed became prime minister in 2018. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia’s ruling coalition for nearly three decades, with Tigrayans, who constitute around 6% of Ethiopia’s 110 million people, holding important positions in politics and business. TPLF leaders have accused Mr. Ahmed of sidelining them, while the federal government says the group is trying to divide Ethiopia.<br />Mr. Ahmed’s government has openly targeted prominent Tigrayans. Ethiopia’s army chief has accused the head of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus—who is the highest-profile Tigrayan abroad—of lobbying in favor of the dissident region. Dr. Tedros denied taking sides in the conflict and says he is working for peace.</td>

      <td>Many people are opting for road trips over flights this winter, but icy roads can be risky too. Here, crucial tips from driving experts.</td>
      <td>IF YOU’RE heading over the hills and through the woods this year — not to Grandma’s house, we hope–you’re probably hitting the road. According to a Travelocity survey conducted in October, nearly 80% of respondents traveling over the holidays are planning to drive. For many of the road-trippers who have limited experience traveling snow-packed roads, we asked two pros for tips on how to safely steer away from danger–and not be the confident idiot behind the wheel.<br />Gut reaction Continue along at the same clip. The roads are dry and you’ve got traction, right?<br />What you should actually do “Bridges freeze earliest and melt last,” said Kelsey Mays, vehicle expert and consumer affairs advocate at  Cars.com .  So slow down well in advance of the bridge or overpass. Avoid braking while you’re already driving over either one, leave extra following distance and don’t change lanes, either. “If you’re going too fast, you’ve already made a mistake,” said Nolan Katerberg, U.S. program manager with the training outfit Ford Driving Skills for Life.<br />Gut reaction Swerve to miss it.<br />What you should actually do Go slow, especially during periods of peak animal activity like dusk, to make sure you can have time to safely stop. If you can’t, it sounds heartless, but drive straight toward the animal rather than attempt to swerve to miss it, which can cause you to lose control. New vehicles are designed to absorb head-on impacts to an extent, but hitting an animal sideways can be disastrous. “You can fix a vehicle if you hit the deer, but if you swerve into oncoming traffic and hit a vehicle, there’s a good chance you’ll get hurt,” said Mr. Katerberg.</td>

      <td>Democrats have tried to draw a curtain over the FBI’s Russia-collusion investigation since their party’s role in that politicized probe came to light. A Biden Administration will have a harder time burying the truth now that Attorney General Bill Barr has made U.S. Attorney John Durham a special counsel.<br />Mr. Barr on Tuesday alerted Congress to his Oct. 19 decision, two weeks before the election, to grant Mr. Durham the status of a special counsel. Mr. Durham has been investigating the decision by the FBI and intelligence agencies to target Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Durham had planned to wrap up this summer, but the pandemic and new discoveries intervened. So Mr. Barr wanted to “provide him and his team with the assurance that they could complete their work, without regard to the outcome of the election,” according to Mr. Barr’s letter to Congress.<br />In other words, he wants to make it harder for the next AG to sack Mr. Durham. Under DOJ regulations, special counsels aren’t subject to “day-to-day supervision” and can only be removed for “misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of department policies.”<br />Democrats were prime movers of the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe, handing the bureau a fictitious dossier that became the basis for secret surveillance warrants, years of media speculation, and special counsel Robert Mueller. Obama officials and Congressional Democrats were part of the spectacle—including some who may want to serve in a Biden Administration. Mr. Biden’s AG will be under pressure to protect reputations by shutting down Mr. Durham before he can issue indictments or an embarrassing report.<br />As President, Mr. Biden could still direct his Attorney General to fire Mr. Durham—but at a high political price. Democrats defended Mr. Mueller’s special-counsel status as crucial to finding the truth. and Mr. Barr said this week that Mr. Durham should be provided the protections of “the same regulation.”</td>

      <td>The party needs to spend the next few years doing more than opposing Medicare for All.</td>
      <td>Republicans and Democrats in Washington are stalemated on health care. Republicans long campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act and won House and Senate seats on the issue in 2010 and later. Democrats flipped the script in 2018 and attacked Republicans for trying to undermine the law’s protections for pre-existing conditions. But for now at least, a President Biden will be unable to pass a “public option,” and Republicans will be unable to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The question the GOP ought to ponder is: What does it want to accomplish on health care?<br />Mr. Biden may make changes on the margins. He might expand ObamaCare by adding special enrollment periods, banning short-term health plans, automating enrollment for low-income beneficiaries in states that haven’t expanded Medicaid, or by making subsidies more generous. Republicans will likely continue challenging the law in court.<br />Opposition to ObamaCare and a single-payer health system kept Republicans united but unprepared to act when they controlled the White House, House and Senate in 2017. The GOP repealed the individual mandate penalty, health-insurance tax, medical-device tax and Cadillac tax, but the Affordable Care Act remains largely intact. Conservatives must now use their time to prepare, so they won’t be caught flat-footed next time they are in charge. Consider three questions:<br />• Do conservatives continue fighting for a full repeal of ObamaCare spending and taxes, or do they accept current spending as the baseline? Republicans have a history of saying they want to repeal ObamaCare, but using some of the dollars on other health-care priorities, and spending the rest on balancing the budget. Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy proposed block-granting the law’s Medicaid spending to states. Some Republicans have proposed redeploying ObamaCare’s exchange subsidies and Medicaid funding into more market-friendly refundable tax credits and high-risk pools.<br />It is easier politically to spend money differently than to spend less, or to try to offset some of the spending with savings elsewhere in the budget. The Congressional Budget Office won’t score enough savings through various fraud and waste initiatives to fund the significant coverage subsidies many Republicans want to offer voters accustomed to ObamaCare. Conservatives have thus suggested policies like litigation reform, prescription-drug savings, premium support in Medicare, and Medicaid savings through block grants with slower growth rates and state flexibility.</td>

      <td>His research was rigorous, and he was one of the few economists who know how to engage with the public.</td>
      <td>America has lost one of its greatest economists and public intellectuals. Walter Williams died Wednesday morning after teaching his final class at George Mason University on Tuesday. He was 84.<br />For 40 years Walter was the heart and soul of George Mason’s unique Department of Economics. Our department unapologetically resists the trend of teaching economics as if it’s a guide for social engineers. This resistance reflects Walter’s commitment to liberal individualism and his belief that ordinary men and women deserve, as his friend Thomas Sowell puts it, “elbow room for themselves and a refuge from the rampaging presumptions of their ‘betters.’ ”<br />A onetime cabdriver who grew up poor in Philadelphia, Walter knew injustice—and understood the way to fight it wasn’t by emoting but by probing and learning. In 1972 he earned a doctorate in economics from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he learned to look beneath surface phenomena for deeper causes and consequences.<br />His pioneering 1982 book, “The State Against Blacks,” is an eloquent, data-rich broadside against occupational licensing, taxicab regulations, labor-union privileges and other fine-sounding government measures that inflict disproportionate harm on blacks by restricting the employment options and by driving up the costs of goods and services.<br />The economics profession boasts many excellent minds, but it has precious few with the ability and interest to do rigorous research and to engage the public with its results. Milton Friedman was such a scholar, as is Thomas Sowell. Walter was in their league. From his appearance on Friedman’s PBS program “Free To Choose” (1980) through his stints as guest host of Rush Limbaugh’s radio program to his syndicated column, Walter brought economic lessons to life in a way few others could.</td>

The Fed and Treasury had established those programs with some of the $454 billion Congress had made available in the law.<br />“This was not a political decision. I was merely implementing the Cares Act,” Mr. Mnuchin said, echoing comments he made on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee.<br />Mr. Mnuchin also said that the programs weren’t needed anymore and that the money he hadn’t approved for the programs, as well as other funds that wouldn’t be needed, would be better used on another pandemic relief bill.<br />Mr. Mnuchin said he had explained his reasoning and underscored that his decision wasn’t politically motivated in a recent phone call with Janet Yellen, who is President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to serve as the next Treasury secretary. He said she didn’t express an opinion during the call.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A broad cross section of big U.S. corporations including  Amazon.com Inc.,   Citigroup Inc.  and  Ford Motor Co.  are calling on Congress to work closely with President-elect Joe Biden to address the threat of climate change.<br />In a letter to be sent to Congress and the Biden transition team on Wednesday, more than 40 companies say they support the U.S. rejoining the Paris climate accord, and urge “President-elect Biden and the new Congress to work together to enact ambitious, durable, bipartisan climate solutions.”<br />The letter doesn’t detail any specific action plan or policy proposal, but it is the latest indication that a significant cohort of corporate America is lining up with environmentalists on climate change.<br />General Motors Co.  said last week that it will no longer back the Trump administration’s legal battle to strip California’s authority to set its own fuel-efficiency regulations.<br />Days before that, the American Farm Bureau Federation—once one of the major opponents of climate legislation in Congress—announced a new agribusiness coalition to promote federal support for cutting agricultural emissions.</td>

      <td>With a new Apple TV+ special featuring Ariana Grande, Snoop Dogg, Misty Copeland and more, the singer is expanding on the institution she created</td>
      <td>On a video call before Thanksgiving, Mariah Carey looks like she’s on a Christmas card come to life. The singer with 19 No. 1 songs to her name is wearing a dress with the sparkle of snow crystals, and her hair flows over her shoulders in frosty waves. She’s surrounded by gift wrapped packages, fuzzy pillows and white trees glowing with lights.<br />“I’m sitting here with eight trees in my house,” she says of the setting for the interview. “It’s completely over the top.”<br />It’s an apt description for Ms. Carey’s commitment to Christmas—and the bountiful seasonal business that has become a pillar of her career. Her 26-year-old song “All I Want for Christmas Is You” is the engine of one of the biggest holiday hit machines of all time. The song, off a 1994 Christmas album that initially seemed like a risky detour, only simmered for years as a staple of Christmas radio. But in the digital era it has undergone a miraculous ascent, thanks to its age-defying bop, the power of holiday playlists, the multiplying effects of the streaming ecosystem, and her fans’ ritual dedication to the song. She has built a franchise around the propulsive tune in recent years with alternate versions and videos, and a book and animated movie for kids.<br />This year’s big Christmas play: a TV special for Apple, an accompanying soundtrack album, and a new take on a later yuletide composition of Ms. Carey’s, “Oh Santa!” This version features Ariana Grande and Jennifer Hudson, and a girl-group production style that Ms. Carey conceived as “a Supremes moment.”<br />“All I Want for Christmas Is You” snowballed to 309 million on-demand audio and video streams last year, according to Nielsen Music/MRC Data. That helped push it to No. 1 on Billboard’s all-genre Hot 100 songs chart for the first time. It got streamed more than chestnuts like Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” and other latter-day standards like Wham!’s “Last Christmas.” As of Thanksgiving this year, her song had reappeared among the more fleeting hits on the chart (most recently at No. 14), where it’s almost guaranteed to climb as Christmas approaches.</td>

The recount is expected to be completed Wednesday night.<br />Mr. Raffensperger spoke the day after one of his senior staffers, Gabriel Sterling, made an emotional appeal at the state Capitol urging Mr. Trump to condemn threats against election workers.</td>

      <td>President-elect inherits a Fed largely out of ammo and faces a potentially divided Congress</td>
      <td>Joe Biden has been here before. Twelve years ago, as Barack Obama’s newly elected vice president, Mr. Biden inherited an economy laid low by a once-in-a-century crisis.<br />The good news is that, unlike then, the recovery from the pandemic-driven economic contraction is now under way and with vaccines about to be approved, an end to the latest crisis is in sight. The bad news for Mr. Biden is that while he and his team want to accelerate the recovery, they may not be able to do much about it. Monetary policy is largely exhausted and fiscal policy is at the mercy of Congress.<br />In 2009, Democrats controlled both the House and Senate. If Republicans win at least one of two runoffs in Georgia next month, they will retain control of the Senate, where they will likely take a harder line on deficits than they did under President Trump.<br />The emphasis Mr. Biden has placed on the recovery can be seen from who he has asked to steer it. If confirmed, Janet Yellen would be the first practicing economist to serve as Treasury secretary in two decades. She has spent her career in academia and government, including as head of the Federal Reserve, studying and managing the balance between unemployment and inflation.<br />Today, it is clear which is the priority. Like the financial crisis 12 years ago, “The pandemic and economic fallout…have caused so much damage for so many,” she said Tuesday. “It’s essential that we move with urgency. Inaction will produce a self-reinforcing downturn causing yet more devastation.”</td>

Now, full-time residential M.B.A. programs continue to report higher application volumes for next fall and expect to have fewer spots to offer than in years past, since schools have allowed many international students to defer enrollment due to virus-related travel restrictions.<br />Prospective students say they’re already feeling the crunch.<br />Jimmy Lin applied several months ago to six of the top-ranked full-time M.B.A. programs for fall 2021. Five rejected him. If Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management doesn’t accept him in the coming weeks, he says he’ll most likely apply again in 2022.</td>

It will need to pass three more votes to become law, a process that will likely stretch into next week or longer. The parties could still reach a compromise that could avert the government’s collapse.<br />The dissolution of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, would trigger a fresh election, likely in March.<br />The prospect of that underscores the continuous pressure Mr. Netanyahu faces amid what may be his toughest political challenges to date: managing the coronavirus pandemic, along with its economic fallout, while standing trial for corruption.<br />After three elections in the space of one year, Mr. Netanyahu failed to cobble together enough support and in May joined a unity government with Blue and White leader Benny Gantz. Ahead of Wednesday’s vote, Mr. Gantz said his party would support the measure introduced by Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid, who split from Mr. Gantz’s party when the latter joined Mr. Netanyahu’s government.</td>

He included a facial-recognition analysis that showed strong evidence of a match.<br />Mr. Utley wasn’t convinced. “Identifying people of generations ago by face recognition is almost always a non-starter,” he wrote back. “It’s a very long shot that these portraits are of the Daltons.”<br />Facial-recognition technology, commonly used to unlock phones, open doors and even surveil the unsuspecting public, is roiling the world of antique photograph collecting. Hobbyists have turned to facial-recognition software to try to match faces in found photos to those of famous historical figures.<br />Antiquities brokers, auctioneers and historians, however, say such methods aren’t dependable, and that the technology has loosed a flood of bogus claims about the identifies of people in ordinary old photos. Hobbyists interested in the 19th century American West have surfaced with claims about newly found photos of the bad guys like Billy the Kid and Jesse James and famed lawmen such as Wyatt Earp and Pat Garrett.</td>

Other, less affluent city dwellers eventually followed, looking to secure a pop-up rental or spot on a parent’s couch.<br />Now a lot of the runaways have returned, but with New York in another partial lockdown, they and their families are aching for the pre-pandemic Gotham they left behind.<br />To reclaim New York City this season and view the metropolis all lit-up like a Christmas tree, gather the relatives and get moving on up to a deluxe compartment in the sky: One of Manhattan’s four loftiest observatories, a vantage point from which the city’s persona never changes. Next fall, a fifth viewing platform—confidently called the Summit—opens on East 42nd Street on the 59th floor of the One Vanderbilt building.<br />Unsurprisingly, the city’s observatories are far less crowded these days. As required by New York state law, they have cut capacity by 75% and have high-tech air-purification systems in place. Elevators are all touchless. Masks and reservations are mandatory.<br />Even Horace Greeley, the storied American newspaper editor, might amend his famous dictate to “Don’t go West.” And forget about Westchester or Long Island.

But as with much of his agenda, the fate of his plans rests on which party has control of the Senate following Georgia’s runoff elections in January.<br />Mr. Biden’s boldest proposals include lowering the age for Medicare enrollment to 60 from 65 and instituting a public-option health plan.<br />Tackling the surge of coronavirus cases will pose the most immediate challenge. Mr. Biden is focusing on the pandemic ahead of his inauguration with his own coronavirus advisory group. He has already used his role as president-elect to urge the public to wear masks and social distance, and his transition team has begun working with the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services.<br />They have also been in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-diseases expert. Mr. Biden has yet to name a new Health and Human Services secretary.<br />Kate Bedingfield, a senior Biden transition adviser, said last week that the transition agency review teams had reached out to the White House and each relevant federal agency to request briefings on “all matters related to the Covid-19 response.” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said last week that Mr. Biden’s team had been briefed on Covid response by Rear Admiral Erica Schwartz, the deputy surgeon general.</td>

States, which will ultimately decide how to allocate Covid-19 vaccine supplies, don’t need to follow the guidelines, though they usually do. But logistics and other aspects of the effort may differ among states, even among those that broadly accept the panel’s conclusions.<br />Vaccines are on track for federal authorization this month and could begin shipping within days of receiving clearance, U.S. officials have said. CVS and Walgreens will deliver most vaccine doses for the nation’s approximately 15,600 nursing homes and 29,000 assisted-living communities.<br />Hospitals and other medical clinics are slated to serve as vaccination sites for health-care workers in the initial rollout, but pharmacy workers are expected to come to nursing homes and other adult-care facilities to deliver and administer the vaccines to residents and, likely, staff.<br />The long-term care rollout will be an early test of how quickly and efficiently CVS, Walgreens and governments can distribute Covid-19 vaccines, a campaign expected to last months. They are working to address storage and transportation issues for vaccines that need to be kept at colder temperatures than vaccines for other diseases, as well as concerns that some residents and staffers may decline the shots.</td>

The episodes run 45 minutes to an hour, usually four days a week, and unpack such things as the plot, scenery, actors and Christmas ornaments. Regular segments include “All the Feels”—about what, if anything, emotionally overwhelmed the reviewers.

      <td>The coronavirus pandemic has supercharged growth of mobile money—and credit—on the continent</td>
      <td>Consumers struggling with Covid-19 shutdowns across sub-Saharan Africa have found a new place to get cash to make ends meet: their cellphones.<br />Tidahy Jacquot, 65 years old, a retired ministry of transport worker who lives in Madagascar’s capital city Antananarivo, hasn’t received any government grants or assistance and has been unable to make his normal income doing odd jobs. But he did get a loan of 60,000 ariary, equivalent to about $16, via his account with French telecom giant  Orange SA .<br />By depositing more money into his mobile money wallet, he qualified for a loan and got an answer to his request for cash in about 10 seconds. He used the digital cash to stock up on rice.<br />“I am thankful…it was helpful in a critical moment,” he said.<br />African consumers have long been paying each other for goods and services on cellphones, making them among the earliest adopters of mobile money services in the world. The pandemic has turbocharged the usage of digital cash. It has also hastened the use of cellphones not just to transfer money, but also to take out loans and deliver government assistance.</td>

But this is just the start of a long journey before they fulfill their transformative potential.<br />Signs of very early-stage commercialization are emerging from the corporate science projects that want to remove human drivers from vehicles. Alphabet’s Waymo seems furthest ahead with its “robotaxi” project in the suburbs of Phoenix Customers used to have to sign a nondisclosure agreement to hail a ride with no backup driver, but Waymo opened the service up in October.<br />Others aren’t far behind. Motional, a $4 billion joint venture between South Korean car giant Hyundai and automotive supplier Aptiv, said last month that it will take safety drivers out of its taxis that operate on the  Lyft  platform around Las Vegas “in the coming months.” Cruise Automation, the driverless-car business controlled by  General Motors ,  has said it would remove backup drivers from its cars by the year-end. Cruise runs vehicles around busy San Francisco, but without passengers or cargo.<br />Doing without safety drivers is an important milestone, but there are plenty more. Once companies have worked out how to operate robotaxis safely in one urban district in good weather, they will need to adapt to new areas and a wider range of conditions. Eventually, this kind of gradual expansion should give driverless cars the scale necessary to drive down costs and compete with human-driven taxis, public transport and, in the very long run, car ownership.</td>

      <td>MAINZ, Germany—The story of the first Covid-19 vaccine to be authorized in the West began 30 years ago in rural Germany when two young physicians, the children of Turkish migrants and freshly in love, pledged to invent a new treatment for cancer.<br />It has taken 10 months for Germany’s  BioNTech SE  and its U.S. partner,  Pfizer Inc.,  to develop the vaccine that was granted emergency-use authorization in the U.K. on Wednesday—beating the previous Western record for a vaccine by more than three years.<br />Yet, for BioNTech’s founders, Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci, the husband-and-wife team behind the successful endeavor, it was the outcome of three decades of work, starting long before the coronavirus first appeared in humans last winter.<br />When the pandemic broke out, Dr. Sahin had spent years studying mRNA, genetic instructions that can be delivered into the body to help it defend itself against viruses and other threats. In January, days before the illness was first diagnosed in Europe, he used this knowledge to design a version of the vaccine on his home computer.<br />“The success of Ugur and Özlem is a fantastic combination of two people who complement each other,” said Rolf Zinkernagel, a Swiss Nobel Prize laureate who once employed Dr. Sahin in his Zurich lab. “He is an innovative scientist, and she is an amazing clinician with a great sense for running a business.”</td>

      <td>Bond market weighs whether the central bank will purchase more later-dated Treasurys to provide additional stimulus</td>
      <td>Some investors are betting that the Federal Reserve could start buying more long-term U.S. Treasurys as soon as its next policy meeting, a trend that has helped temper some recent selling and kept yields from rising higher.<br />One factor influencing such bets: the outcome of the Nov. 3 election, which resulted in the strong possibility of divided government in Washington and left investors thinking the Fed might need to assume more responsibility to support an economy increasingly buffeted by a surge in coronavirus cases.<br />Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s decision to not extend several emergency Fed lending programs beyond Dec. 31 also left the Fed with fewer alternatives to Treasury purchases for economic stimulus. Buying bonds helps boost the economy by reducing longer-term Treasury yields, lowering the cost of borrowing for individuals and businesses.<br />Minutes from the Fed’s Nov. 4-5 meeting released last week offered few clues about prospects for policy changes at the central bank’s next meeting on Dec. 15-16. Officials in early November didn’t think it was necessary to make immediate adjustments to their bond-buying program. But they “recognized that circumstances could shift to warrant such adjustments,” the minutes said.<br />Renewed hopes that Congress could pass some sort of coronavirus-aid package in a lame-duck session helped lift the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to 0.933% on Tuesday from 0.845% Monday. But that remained below the 0.970% mark it reached three weeks ago, just after  Pfizer Inc.  released highly encouraging results from its coronavirus vaccine trial.</td>
