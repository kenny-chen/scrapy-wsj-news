      <td>WASHINGTON—The Senate confirmed President Biden’s pick to lead the sprawling U.S. intelligence community Wednesday, delivering the newly inaugurated president his first Senate-confirmed cabinet secretary.<br />Avril Haines is the first woman to become director of national intelligence, a job that oversees 18 intelligence agencies and units, including the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency, which employ hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors.<br />The Senate voted 84-10 to confirm Ms. Haines, with only Republicans opposing her nomination.<br />Mr. Biden’s aides have said it is imperative for the new president to have his national security team in place as soon as possible to address pressing threats ranging from domestic extremist violence of the kind that was on display during the storming of the U.S. Capitol two weeks ago to a suspected Russian hack of huge swaths of the federal government. The Senate is expected to act in the coming days on some of Mr. Biden’s other nominees.<br />“This position is of such critical importance to the country that is only appropriate that it will be the first nomination of the new Biden administration to be confirmed by the Senate,” said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the incoming Democratic leader of the Senate Intelligence Committee.</td>

According to a Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit, Mr. Biggs posted a message online about attending the Jan. 6 rally that authorities say was similar to a message posted by the leader of the Proud Boys.<br />Mr. Biggs made an initial appearance Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Orlando. An attorney for Mr. Biggs couldn’t be identified. Calls and texts to numbers associated with Mr. Biggs weren’t immediately returned.<br />Mr. Biggs is among the more than 100 suspects arrested in a sweeping federal investigation of the Capitol riot, which left five people dead, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer. Federal authorities have arrested multiple members of the Proud Boys for their alleged involvement in the attack on the Capitol, along with some other far-right groups.<br />Also on Wednesday, a federal judge in New York detained a Connecticut man charged with using a police shield to violently press a Capitol Police officer against a door during the riot, an attack captured in a widely circulated video. The judge said the man, Patrick Edward McCaughey III, 23, posed a danger to the community.</td>

Both measures were put in place last year in response to economic hardships caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The executive order for federal student loans directs the Education Department to extend the pause on principal payments and interest accrual for direct federal loans until at least Sept. 30, 2021.<br />Loan repayments and interest accrual has been paused for borrowers with federal student loans since March 13, 2020.

      <td>Whatever their partisan affiliation, all Americans can take pride in Wednesday’s inaugural proceedings for President Joe Biden. The peaceful transfer of power from one party to another is a sign of underlying democratic strength no matter our current political distemper.<br />The ceremony at the Capitol had an unabashed patriotic feel that is all too rare these days. Traditional anthems and prayerful invocations were the order of the hour. Former Presidents were on hand from both major parties as usual, even if Donald Trump wasn’t. No one took a knee when Lady Gaga sang the national anthem.<br />And it was especially moving, at least to us, to see new Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband walk down the Capitol steps escorting Mike Pence and his wife to their waiting car. Mr. Pence in particular deserved this traditional show of respect after his role on Jan. 6 when he refused to reject the state electoral votes as President Trump demanded. He should be getting more praise than he is for that display of constitutional principle.<br />These rituals send a message to a diverse country, and to the world, about America’s fundamental institutional strength despite a bitter election campaign and the turmoil of recent weeks. In China the transfers of power are from one Communist Party cadre to another, and public political rites are limited to unanimous acclamation. Enemies have often misjudged America’s raucous politics for national weakness—to their eventual regret.<br />Mr. Biden struck many good notes in an Inaugural Address that will be remembered more for its moment following the Capitol riot than for its words. The speech had a personal flavor with touches of his Catholicism, such as quoting St. Augustine and praying for the dead. In this and in other personal manners, the new President is refreshingly unwoke.</td>

      <td>On the last-minute clemency list, Steve Bannon stands out.</td>
      <td>On his way out the door Wednesday, President Trump granted a long list of pardons and commutations, and it’s a mix of the reasonable, the unseemly and the egregious. Here’s looking at you, Steve Bannon.<br />Of 143 people granted clemency, many are drug offenders. To pick a commutation, Isaac Nelson served more than half of his mandatory 20 years for crimes involving at least five kilograms of cocaine and 50 grams of crack, the White House said. Under the First Step Act, signed in 2018, “he would likely face a 10-year sentence.”<br />Some of the drug crimes are no small matter, since they appear to involve trafficking literally tons of marijuana, plus laundering millions of dollars, which is a business that can turn violent fast. Yet public attitudes toward marijuana have shifted. Determining that a sentence was excessive is a judgment call, which is why a President has broad clemency discretion.<br />Less admirable is the pardon for Duke Cunningham, the former Congressman who’s no longer in prison, but who betrayed his constituents by taking bribes. Ditto on the commutation for Salomon Melgen, a big Democratic donor caught up in the probe of Sen. Robert Menendez. Dr. Melgen was given a 17-year sentence for defrauding Medicare of $42 million.<br />Mr. Trump, thankfully, didn’t pardonEdward Snowden. But why pardon Mr. Bannon? He was charged with fleecing Trump supporters in a scheme to build a private wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. The fund raised $25 million, the indictment says, and donors were told every penny would go to the project.</td>

      <td>China’s projection of power isn’t only a regional concern. It will eventually pose a threat to the U.S.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration’s Middle East policy will reportedly focus on rejoining the Iran nuclear deal and renewing Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. This could undermine key allies in Israel and Saudi Arabia while ignoring a core geopolitical challenge that few in Washington are addressing: growing Chinese influence in the Middle East.<br />Through its trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, China has invested in a port near the Persian Gulf in Gwadar, Pakistan, and a military base by the entrance to the Red Sea at Djibouti. The Chinese also envision a military base at Port Sudan, further north on the Red Sea, and a naval facility at Jiwani, Pakistan, on the Iranian border. Then there are the new Israeli port facilities at Haifa and Ashdod, which the Chinese will likely be administering. Afghanistan could one day become a branch line for the Belt and Road corridor from western China through Pakistan to the Arabian Sea. China is the largest trading partner for both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. China is investing billions of dollars in Egypt and more billions as part of a strategic pact with Iran.<br />Unlike many in Washington, who separate regions in order of perceived importance, Chinese strategists think organically about geography. They recognize that in a smaller, more interconnected and confining world, regions and continents work together and flow into each other. Thus, the Chinese know that the road, railway and port system they are building across the Middle East will one day give them a strong hand in Europe and East Asia—not to mention East Africa.<br />Beijing doesn’t take sides. China is happy to work with Iran, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Rather than promote a liberal vision—or any vision—the Chinese are remorselessly mercantile and imperial in their approach. It’s all about money and transportation links: classical geography fitted to a postmodern world.<br />For centuries British foreign policy was aimed at preventing any one power from dominating continental Europe. Similarly, American foreign policy should now aim at preventing any one power from dominating Afro-Eurasia—what the great British geographer Halford Mackinder labeled the “World-Island.” By linking Europe with East Asia through the Middle East, China would eventually develop the ability to threaten North America economically and militarily. This is ultimately what Belt and Road is all about. The Biden administration must focus on stopping it.</td>

      <td>How to keep working-class Trump voters while winning back support in the suburbs?</td>
      <td>President Joe Biden’s inauguration marks not only a new administration’s beginning but also a new chapter for the loyal opposition.<br />The Grand Old Party lost the White House while picking up U.S. House seats, holding half the Senate, and adding to its numbers in state legislative chambers. These conflicting outcomes leave Republicans facing the difficult task of cementing blue-collar Trump voters into their ranks while regaining strength in the suburbs and making inroads with an increasingly diverse electorate.<br />To rebuild, Republicans must decide what their party stands for. The way forward begins with clarifying what the GOP’s answers should be to the nation’s challenges, with an eye to the 2022 elections.<br />This won’t be easy. Tensions between the party’s various elements are difficult to navigate, but it’s important to remember that President Donald Trump’s most popular achievements were conservative: originalist judges, a pro-growth tax cut, regulatory relief, strong national defense, recognition of the global threat posed by China, secure borders, and respect for life and religious liberty.<br />GOP officeholders, candidates and party leaders should offer ideas that apply timeless conservative principles to America’s changing circumstances. As Republicans oppose the Biden administration’s agenda, they should contrast their new initiatives with the Democrats’ approach. The key is to remember that what they’re for is as important as what they’re against. The values underlying Republican initiatives are crucial, too. There are more conservatives in America who believe in traditional values, family, faith, personal responsibility, patriotism and law and order than there are liberals who don’t.</td>

      <td>Americans don’t like the idea of a national identity card. But in an era of intense controversies over election integrity and illegal immigration, it is time to rethink the subject.<br />Our views on national identity documents trace back to the British. When the U.S. was founded, immigration was largely unregulated, and people knew their neighbors, so voting was secure.<br />We are now in a crisis in which many people lack confidence in the integrity of elections. Some of these fears are unfounded, but in 2020 unsolicited mailing of ballots and abandoning of signature checks on mail ballots provided the basis for skepticism far beyond the concerns of prior years. Restoring trust in elections is crucial to the country’s unity.<br />Republicans have long pushed for in-person voting using government-issued photo ID. Democrats have opposed such a system on grounds that the poor are less likely to have such identification. But if everyone had a national identity card and presented it when voting, we could have full enfranchisement with full integrity.<br />Immigration could also benefit from a national ID card. In 1986 Congress enacted a grand compromise in which amnesty for illegal aliens was paired with discouraging further illegal immigration by mandating checks of immigration status for people being hired. Such checks failed because no identity system was in place; the result was amnesty with a surge of new illegal immigration.</td>

      <td>Nasdaq wants to mandate wider representation on its companies’ boards but has little proof of the benefits.</td>
      <td>Corporate directors are called on to do a few important things: Hire a CEO and oversee management, provide strategic direction, protect and promote the interests of investors, and ensure the company’s books are honest. Now, many claim, directors should also represent the country’s demographics.<br />That is the upshot of a requirement by one of America’s largest financial markets. Nasdaq is calling for all its listed companies to appoint within the next four years no fewer than two “diverse” directors: at least one woman, and one person from an underrepresented racial or ethnic group or someone who identifies as LGBTQ. Any company failing this requirement would be obligated to explain why. This new standard now faces approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br />It would be tempting for the SEC, soon to be led by a Biden appointee, to approve the proposal. Many of the calls for diversity requirements on board membership and recruitment are being made by large asset managers and institutional investors. The SEC could conceivably approve it in the name of investor-led democracy.<br />But that would be shortsighted. For one thing, diversity requirements are political at their core and, in my experience, any securities regulation that feeds the base instincts of political partisanship will inevitably be undone by the opposing party when it has the chance, or face challenges in the courts. Regulation that is enduring and sustainable—on any issue—requires the SEC’s expert analysis, professional moderation and careful review.<br />The issue of diversity on boards is also emotional, and it often creates more heat than light. Both sides have plenty of anecdotes to draw from. I have stacks of annual reports from boards with members who are all white, all male, all over 50—and quite mediocre. At the same time, I have seen women or minorities whose membership on corporate boards was forgettable at best. There is no guarantee of competence in a director based on sex or skin color.</td>

Mike Sommers, president and chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, used his annual address last week to strike a conciliatory tone at times, saying it wanted to work with Mr. Biden on emissions limits and trade policy.<br />But he also said the group would aggressively defend the industry on core interests, especially access to federal lands and offshore oil.<br />“The bottom line for us is that we are going to work with the Biden administration when we can, but we will oppose them when we must,” Mr. Sommers said. “We will do everything we can to fight for the oil-and-gas industry across the United States.”</td>

      <td></td>
      <td>While we celebrate that the death rate from cancer in the U.S. dropped 2.4% from 2017 to 2018 and that the cancer mortality rate has fallen 31% since its peak in 1991 (“Cancer Death Rate in 2018 Fell By the Largest-Ever Yearly Amount,” U.S. News, Jan. 13), Covid-19 is having a negative effect on cancer prevention and early detection.<br />The Prevent Cancer Foundation’s research shows a significant portion of adults are missing or postponing scheduled cancer screenings, and African-Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately affected. And let’s not forget that 20% of parents are missing their children’s scheduled vaccinations to protect against serious diseases—including the HPV vaccine, which can prevent at least six types of cancer.<br />We know that in the coming months and years, preventable deaths from cancer will increase. Now isn’t the time to be complacent. With screening, cancer can be prevented or detected early to dramatically improve patient outcomes. Americans need to keep routine cancer screenings appointments or reschedule the ones they have missed.<br />We are encouraging people to get their cancer screenings back on the books and talk to their health-care providers about the safety precautions that are in place so they can feel comfortable keeping those appointments. Breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, oral, prostate and skin cancer screenings are important to prevent cancer or detect it early. These screenings save lives.<br />Thank you for elevating awareness on the importance of screenings and options available to patients. We are making tremendous advances in the fight against cancer. By getting doctors’ appointments back on the books, we can save lives.</td>

      <td>There is a once-in-a-century opportunity to unlock this region’s upside potential, including New York City proper, by unifying the transit network centered on a rethought and rebuilt above-ground Penn Station.</td>
      <td>Michael J. Lewis’s “Upping the Waiting Game—Moynihan Train Hall, the expansion of Penn Station, imbues rail travel with some grandeur” (Arts in Review, Jan. 14) affirms the importance of proactivity and innovation when skeptics are writing cities off.<br />Moynihan’s success should be a starting point for broadening our thinking to include the entire region. At ReThinkNYC, we believe there is a once-in-a-century opportunity to unlock this region’s upside potential, including New York City proper, by unifying the transit network centered on a rethought and rebuilt above-ground Penn Station, like the original, across from the Moynihan. This will address Mr. Lewis’s concern that the Moynihan will be an “orphan” until the train lines are “organically integrated” and their century-old “piecemeal accretion” is put behind us. New or expanded transit hubs in Sunnyside, Queens, Secaucus and the Bronx would expand the region’s core to reduce car traffic, allow for fluid intraregional access to housing and the job market and add economic relevance to such places as Newark, Paterson and Jamaica, Queens. We would recreate a modernized, yet faithful, version of the original high-ceilinged naturally lighted McKim, Mead and White Penn Station, attracting ridership and maximizing positive economic activity. London’s acclaimed conversion of the St. Pancras station is an apt precedent.<br />Our proposals affirm the approach to streetscape and scale that Jane Jacobs, who actively protested the original Penn Station’s destruction, found so important in cities. Our hope is to help the region move beyond the auto-centric approach to land-use and funding decisions that, as Robert Caro pointed out in “The Power Broker,” impeded the quality of life in the tristate region for decades and, sadly, continues to do so today.<br />Samuel Turvey<br />Chairperson, ReThinkNYC</td>

      <td>Tension is rising between European authorities and  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  after officials said the companies had unexpectedly cut their deliveries of Covid-19 vaccines and put their immunization schedules at risk.<br />The Italian government asked the country’s attorney general to study whether it can take legal action after Pfizer cut deliveries of its vaccine for this week by 29% as it retools its Belgium factory, a government spokeswoman said Wednesday.<br />Separately, the German state of Hamburg said Pfizer had delivered fewer vials of vaccine to the city than expected this week.<br />In Europe, Pfizer and BioNTech initially shipped vials of five-vaccine doses, but because of a precautionary practice known as overfilling, the vials contained enough extra liquid for a sixth dose. After the European Union’s drugs agency ruled on Jan. 8 that six doses could be obtained from a vial, the companies cut the number of vials delivered, arguing that their contract was for a certain amount of doses, not vials. The companies have said they were on schedule to deliver the number of doses they had promised.<br />A Hamburg government spokeswoman said the state has struggled to extract the sixth dose as special syringes are required and authorities haven’t been able to purchase them in sufficient quantities. This has left their mobile vaccination teams that inoculate care homes unable to use the full amount of vaccine, she said.</td>

Put them all together and you had an inaugural unlike any America has ever seen, or is likely to see again. All of which gave extra poignancy to the question of what the new president would tell a troubled nation.</td>

      <td>An interactive tour of the empty Vatican Museums offers the chance to experience the Sistine Chapel and other Renaissance treasures without the crowds.</td>
      <td>Typically, the Vatican Museums are a source of both pleasure and frustration. Amid the throngs, it can be impossible to achieve any kind of contemplative state to allow real absorption of their many artistic treasures. While we are limited to armchair travel because of Covid-19, the impressive virtual visits offered by the Vatican Museums create the pleasurable sensation of seeing these typically crowded halls all alone. Digital tourism also allows you to see a few of the many rooms normally closed to the public, such as the Niccoline Chapel with frescoes by Fra Angelico (1395-1455).<br />All told, there are 26 distinct areas within the Vatican, ranging from the Pinacoteca or painting gallery; to unexpected troves such as the Jewish Lapidarium, containing inscriptions from the Jewish catacomb of Monteverde; and the ethnological collection, spanning works from Africa to China and Latin America, primarily the product of missionary work. The Vatican Museums website offers unusual accessibility to all of them—with a short introductory video, text and photographs and, in many cases, virtual tours.<br />Among the most stunning opportunities these tours create is to see each of Raphael’s four Stanze, a suite of rooms created for popes Julius II (1503-13) and Leo X (1513-21), as one rarely can in person. On walls and ceilings, Raphael depicted historical and philosophical allegories, complex subjects glorifying the history of the papacy as well as forging connections between the Christian and classical, pre-Christian civilizations.<br />In the the Stanza della Segnatura (1508-11), the magnificent fictive architecture of Raphael’s “The School of Athens”—with its expansive vault referring both to ancient ruins such as the Basilica of Maxentius and to ambitious new constructions then under way, such as St. Peter’s—is engrossing in itself. So are the varied attitudes and poses of that fresco’s ancient philosophers and mathematicians—the work includes portraits of Bramante as Euclid and Michelangelo as the famously ill-tempered philosopher Heraclitus.<br />But if one looks immediately across from it, as the 360-degree photography allows you to do, you may notice that Raphael has created an implied visual continuity of the pavement from “The School of Athens” into the fresco opposite, known as the “Disputa.” Above the ground plane, where popes and church fathers congregate, Raphael creates a platform of clouds, surmounted by Old Testament prophets interspersed with martyrs, saints and apostles. While “The School of Athens” represents the entirety of classical knowledge, the “Disputa” represents theological knowledge in two realms, on earth and in the heavens. The conversation Raphael creates across the room bridges the two worlds of the sacred and the secular, part of the larger effort advanced by Julius’s papacy.</td>

Another category of individuals who are eligible to serve as acting officials are those who have served as an “officer or employee” of the same agency for at least 90 days during the preceding year, at a senior-level pay scale.<br />Acting secretaries have the same powers as Senate-confirmed secretaries but are limited by law to serving 210 days. At the start of an administration, acting secretaries are allowed to serve an additional 90 days. And if there is a pending nomination, federal law permits an even longer term of service.<br />Nevertheless, organizations promoting good governance say it is critical to effective government to have Senate-confirmed nominees in place as soon as possible.</td>

That yield, a benchmark rate for borrowing costs throughout the economy, has jumped to 1.089% as of Wednesday’s close, from 0.915% on Jan. 4.

For today’s inauguration, President Joe Biden, first lady Dr. Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff have all chosen to wear the work of American designers or labels, including Ralph Lauren, Christopher John Rogers and Markarian. “These moments on Day One are so important for an industry that’s been so hard hit and impacted by the pandemic,” said Steven Kolb, chief executive officer of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. “By wearing these American designers, they’re not only boosting the business of those individuals, but they’re really boosting the $373 billion industry...We have a new administration that clearly is welcoming and wants to be supportive of our industry.”<br />Consciously or not, the color purple—which can be seen as symbolically marrying red and blue—is also a theme, with Ms. Harris, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama all favoring the color for today’s ceremony.<br />For today’s inauguration, the incoming first lady Dr. Biden wore a custom blue wool-tweed dress, coat and matching face mask by New York brand Markarian, which is designed by Alexandra O’Neill. Ms. Harris wore a regal purple coat and dress by Christopher John Rogers, a Black New York designer known for his striking use of color. Mr. Rogers was recently in the spotlight for crafting the structured blue suit worn by Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez in Vanity Fair’s December 2020 cover story on the congresswoman. Ms. Obama, whose fashion choices as first lady were breathlessly covered by the media and in the case of J.Crew, boosted sales of certain items, also chose a Black American designer for today’s inauguration. The former first lady wore a burgundy ensemble by Sergio Hudson.<br />At a pre-inauguration coronavirus memorial event last night, Dr. Biden and Ms. Harris also made strong statements in their choice of designer. Dr. Biden wore a purple dress, coat and a mask from emerging New York designer Jonathan Cohen, whose parents are Mexican. Ms. Harris wore a custom camel coat by Pyer Moss, a label founded by Kerby Jean-Raymond, a socially conscious Black designer of Haitian descent.<br />Ms. Harris’s stepdaughter Ella Emhoff, an art student with an interest in fashion, has gotten buzz on social media for her experimental looks. Yesterday she wore a cutting-edge skirt suit and tie by the American designer Thom Browne. For the inauguration, she wore a plaid embellished coat by Italian label Miu Miu.</td>

Ms. Harris also used Ms. Shelton’s Bible when she was sworn in as California’s attorney general and U.S. senator. Ms. Shelton helped take care of Ms. Harris and her sister while their mother worked when they were growing up.<br />Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice, was selected by Ms. Harris to officiate her swearing-in ceremony. She was escorted inside the Capitol by U.S. Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, a Black officer who redirected a mostly white mob away from lawmakers as they were being evacuated during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.<br />For some in attendance, watching Ms. Harris’s historic achievement was personal.</td>

      <td>Pent-up children can reconfigure chic modular furniture—like the pandemic best-seller the Nugget—into forts and palaces, saving parents sanity</td>
      <td>WHEN RACHEL GEER’S kids started slam-dunking a basketball into a nearby plastic hoop with the sofa as their launchpad, she suppressed the urge to scold. After all, they’d been stuck inside for 10 months. Luckily for the Chapel Hill, N.C., business analyst, the abused couch was a Nugget, the sort of modular sofa designed for such debauchery that interiors pros are recommending to families with children.<br />Beyond their resilience, such pieces are masters of metamorphosis. Amanda Lantz, a designer in Carmel, Ind., appreciates Jaxx’s boxy Modular Kid’s Love seat and Ottoman ($159, brookstone.com) for its ability to transform into a table or sleeper for nap time. Also safely soft-edged, the Kinbor Children’s Sofa can be reconfigured into a table and four chairs. With any modular set-up, Ms. Lantz recommends sticking to durable performance fabric such as Crypton or Inside-Out: “The last thing you want is something kids can crawl all over where every stain is going to show.”<br />Kids can flip, flop and prod the Nugget, from a sofa to bed to fort without help from mom or dad. Also fueling its feverish popularity: washable slipcovers and dense foam cushions. In 2020, sales of the modular settee—launched in 2014 by Nugget Comfort, based in Butner, N. C.—shot up roughly 250% over the previous year, according to co-founder Ryan Cocca. There’s currently a 3-month waiting list. Available in 15 solid colors, the sofa can also jibe aesthetically with adult décor. “I was able to incorporate the Nugget into the den of my home without it looking like a kids’ toy,” Ms. Geer said.<br />Some modular sofas deliver higher style at higher prices.  Roche Bobois ’s  tufted and piped Mah Jong blocks come in a virtually endless choice of pattern, including Missoni’s signature zigzag (from $2,120 per cushion, roche-bobois.com). Designer Jamie Drake in New York relies on Pierre Paulin’s Dune Sofa, which can be reconfigured into hillocks and meadows for imaginative play and extra sleepover spaces (from $4,700 per piece, ralphpucci.com). “With the right modular furniture, kids can be left to their creative devices,” said Mr. Drake, “and when they’re not commandeering it the adults can sink in and relax.”<br />In intergenerational spaces, Ms. Lantz mixes mutable sofas with pop art and a shaggy rug to “make the room not feel so serious.” Another destodgifier: oversize floor pillows. As a bonus, “they work as extra fort-building material.”</td>

Her mother watched from the socially distant, masked audience.<br />President Biden’s inaugural committee told Ms. Gorman on Dec. 30 that she had been selected for the role.<br />She said she approached the task very deliberately, first reviewing speeches given by abolitionist Frederick Douglass and President Lincoln and others who have spoken at divisive times.</td>

This week’s streaming selections speak to the breadth of the service’s programming ambitions: from the critically acclaimed (“The White Tiger”) and the family adventure flick (“We Can Be Heroes”) to international series popular with American audiences (“Lupin”).<br />(Netflix)<br />“We Can Be Heroes” is a film about a group of kids with unique, otherworldly powers—stretching their bodies, fast-forwarding and rewinding time, shaping water—who are enlisted to save the world from an alien invasion after their parents’ superhero crew is captured. It was an instant hit when it was released on Netflix on Christmas. It immediately started bouncing around the service’s top-10 list and has already been given the green light for a sequel.<br />The movie was written, directed and produced by Robert Rodriguez, a creative force behind adult hits like “Once Upon a Time in Mexico” and “From Dusk Till Dawn,” as well as all-ages fare like the “Spy Kids” franchise. Mr. Rodriguez says it got a lot harder to make family fare for traditional studios after 2005’s “The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D” disappointed at the box office. But he says Netflix reached out, told him that these were the kinds of movies that subscribers were watching over and over again, and asked if he’d like to make something for them in that genre. He pounced.<br />Mr. Rodriguez says kids are used to being taken to PG-13 superhero movies that “aren’t really made for them,” but thinks it’s important for them to see kids like themselves in these roles on screen.</td>

He was sentenced in August 2020 to 18 months in prison on one count of stealing trade secrets.<br />Mr. Levandowski left Google’s self-driving unit, Waymo, in 2016 and helped start a company soon acquired by  Uber Technologies Inc.  Google parent  Alphabet Inc.  sued Uber in 2017, claiming that Mr. Levandowski stole thousands of confidential files before leaving Google. Waymo and Uber settled the lawsuit in 2018, but a judge in the case asked federal prosecutors to investigate Uber and Mr. Levandowski over possible trade-secret theft. He was charged by federal authorities with 33 counts of trade-secret theft in August 2019, but a judge ruled that he wouldn’t have to report to prison during the pandemic.<br />The pardon was supported by venture capitalist Peter Thiel and entrepreneur Palmer Luckey, who founded Oculus VR, according to the White House.<br />—Preetika Rana</td>

While the amounts are lower than the $1,200 and $500 delivered last spring, they are having an impact, at least short-term, according to some restaurant executives and industry data.<br />Church’s Chicken, Checkers Drive-In Restaurants Inc.,  Noodles  & Co. and TGI Fridays are among the companies crediting higher sales to the stimulus, according to executives. Some  McDonald’s Corp.  restaurant owners also attributed strong January sales to the recent checks, as did fine-dining chain Fogo de Chão.<br />Chris Elliott, the Tampa, Fla.-based owner of restaurant chains that include Beef ‘O’ Brady’s and the Brass Tap, said the second round of checks contributed to a 6.5% increase in sales this month compared with last.</td>

Chicken suppliers have pushed back in court, pointing to economic factors they said drove poultry prices.<br />Tyson said it reached the settlement with plaintiffs including direct purchasers, commercial and institutional indirect purchasers and end-user consumers. It didn’t admit any liability as part of the settlements and said the settlement is subject to court approval.<br />Tyson said “it believes that the settlements were in the best interests of the company and its shareholders in order to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation.”<br />The Tyson settlement doesn’t cover lawsuits filed separately by individual plaintiffs. Tyson,  Pilgrim’s Pride Corp.  and other U.S. chicken suppliers still face continuing lawsuits from some of their top customers, including chicken-sandwich company Chick-fil-A Inc., supermarket operators  Walmart Inc.  and  Kroger Co. , and food-service distributors  Sysco Corp.  and  US Foods Holding Corp.</td>

      <td>Congress should raise the top corporate rate to 28%, but only for the most profitable companies.</td>
      <td>With President Biden in office and Democrats controlling the Senate, you can expect the new administration to propose a new tax bill soon, including an increase in the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%.<br />This bill will be easier to pass, and do less harm to the economy, if it exempts small businesses from the increase. Small businesses have been the hardest hit by the Covid-19 crisis, particularly in the retail and restaurant industries. By comparison, America’s largest companies have had fairly smooth sailing the past year. Many giants, including  Amazon  and  Home Depot ,  are actually benefiting from the pandemic.<br />Higher taxes on smaller firms would mean less investment in the part of the economy that has traditionally generated the most jobs. With nearly 11 million Americans unemployed, this shouldn’t be overlooked. On top of that, the Treasury wouldn’t have to give up much revenue. Nearly 90% of corporate income tax each year is paid by the nation’s largest 25,000 firms. The remaining 10% or so is paid by about six million smaller companies.<br />There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a small business. But one way the White House and Congress could proceed on corporate taxes would be to apply the proposed increase only to businesses with annual pretax profit of, say, $2.5 million or more. According to my analysis of data from the Internal Revenue Service, that cutoff would allow the Treasury to collect as much as 90% of the gain in corporate tax revenue envisioned under the current Biden plan. So about 25,000 firms would move from a 21% corporate rate to a 28% rate, while nearly six million smaller companies would see no change in their corporate income-tax rate.<br />But about 30 million owners of businesses, most of them very small outfits, would not be affected by an increase in the corporate tax rate because they run their firms as limited liability companies, partnerships or sole proprietorships. The owners of these “pass-through entities” pay taxes on their company profits through their personal income taxes, and many of them benefited from the Trump tax cuts a few years ago, particularly from the 20% deduction on qualified business income. The Biden administration and Congress would be smart to make sure that only the very largest of these 30 million businesses—say, those with more than $2.5 million in annual profit—lose this deduction. That would ensure that America’s largest and most successful companies, whether they are organized as traditional corporations or pass-through entities, pay higher taxes, while the overwhelming majority do not.</td>

      <td>The Senate erroneously asserted jurisdiction once, but dissenting members forced an acquittal.</td>
      <td>Now that Donald Trump is a private citizen, the Senate should dismiss the article of impeachment against him for lack of jurisdiction. The Constitution is clear: “The president . . . shall be removed from office on impeachment . . . and conviction”—not by the expiration of his term before the impeachment process is complete. It also mandates that “judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal and disqualification“—not or disqualification.<br />When the Constitution was written, several states allowed impeachment of former officials. The Framers could easily have included that provision, but they didn’t. They also explicitly chose to prohibit the British practice of trial by legislature—excepting only impeachment—and “bill of attainder,” any punitive legislative act against a specific person. The courts have held that the punishments prohibited by the Bill of Attainder Clause include disqualification from holding office. Moreover, the Constitution requires the chief justice to preside “when the president of the United States is tried.”<br />No former official has ever been convicted by the Senate, and only one has been impeached. Secretary of War William W. Belknap was indisputably guilty of numerous impeachable offences, to which he confessed as he resigned his office hours before the House unanimously impeached him in 1876. The Senate voted in favor of a procedural motion affirming its jurisdiction to try Belknap’s impeachment. But two dozen senators who believed he was guilty voted to acquit on jurisdictional grounds. A close vote nearly a century and a half ago doesn’t establish a binding precedent.<br />A more compelling precedent is the House’s decision not to impeach Richard Nixon. After he left office in 1974 to avoid certain impeachment and conviction, there was no movement to continue the process.<br />Beyond the constitution, there are strong policy and historical reasons an incoming administration shouldn’t seek recriminations against its predecessor. In some countries defeated former presidents and prime ministers are routinely prosecuted. America has lived more in accordance with President Lincoln’s message to the soon-to-be-defeated Confederacy: “With Malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds.”</td>

      <td>Now available to watch online, the Atlanta Opera’s in-person performances embraced Covid-19 restrictions as a creative challenge.</td>
      <td><br /><br />The Atlanta Opera has been one of the few American companies to perform live for in-person audiences during the Covid-19 pandemic. Last fall, using a custom-built, open-sided tent situated on a university baseball field and following rigorous coronavirus protocols, the company gave 17 performances of two one-act operas—Leoncavallo’s “Pagliacci” and Viktor Ullman’s “The Kaiser of Atlantis,” played on alternate days—as well as three concerts. The salaried Atlanta Opera Company Players—a dozen top singers who live in the Atlanta area—and the six members of its young artist program comprise the casts of all the company’s live and digital events.<br />Films of the live operas and concerts, plus some additional videos, are being distributed on the company’s new Spotlight Media platform , at various price points. “Kaiser,” which is available now, along with the “Mezzo Extravaganza” concert, demonstrates how imaginative direction can harness Covid restrictions for artistic effect.<br />Ullmann’s sardonic 60-minute opera, with a libretto by Peter Kien, was composed in 1943 in the Nazi “show” camp Terezín but not performed until 1975 (the creators were killed in Auschwitz). The circus-themed production is directed by Tomer Zvulun, the company’s general and artistic director, with scenic design by Julia Noulin-Mérat, costumes by Joanna Schmink, and lighting by Ben Rawson. It skillfully juxtaposes Holocaust references (mountains of discarded shoes) with the visual signals of our current plague era (masks and four movable booths with clear vinyl sides). Singers inside the booths wear no masks; outside them, other singers and circus performers, all masked, stagger through a seemingly toxic landscape. The despotic Kaiser’s reign has produced a land where life and death are equally meaningless. Drunk with power, he decrees a total war that will kill everyone, but Death, angry at not being consulted, goes on strike. As a result, the populace, afflicted by battle and disease, cannot die.</td>

He declined to comment further.<br />The company has already hired banks to lead the IPO, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bacchus Capital is Nordgold’s financial adviser for the possible offering.<br />Gold has fallen 8.5% since highs last August, but the precious metal is up 57% since the summer of 2018. That long rally has been fueled by ultralow interest rates, which make gold more competitive against yield-bearing investments, and as investors looked for havens amid the spread of the coronavirus.</td>

But in a world increasingly obsessed with tidy convenience, many view the chore of converting food waste into fertilizer for plants and gardens much as they do tending to kombucha scoby or committing to cloth diapers for their infants: too time-consuming, too “granola” and too plain icky.<br />Composting has “been perceived as this very stinky project that takes a bunch of time and only makes sense if you have a big backyard,” said Friday Apaliski, a San Francisco “sustainability concierge” who works with clients to make their homes more green. She believes that people “are starting to understand how truly phenomenal composting is.”<br />Indeed, new composting technology has emerged that makes the process easier, faster and more stylish. Some composting systems are now small enough to live on your kitchen’s countertop and sufficiently attractive that you won’t mind looking at them day after day.<br />And with houseplant ownership skyrocketing (compost is just as good for Instagramable succulents as for an old-time vegetable garden) and a growing desire to reduce methane-producing food waste, more Americans are trying the ancient practice out for themselves. Between 2014 and 2019, according to the 2019 Composting in America report, the number of American communities offering composting programs increased 65%. This summer, Vermont became the first state in the nation to make composting mandatory.<br />If you’re going to do it, why not do it as pleasantly as possible?

      <td>IN MY DREAMS, my laundry room is airy and bright, with wooden folding tables and shelves with baskets to intelligently organize detergents, sewing supplies, my ironing board and clothespins. In other words, it would resemble a modest-size Apple store, except with a whole section devoted to orphan socks.<br />But the laundry room in my reality is a hellhole. It’s a tiny closet, actually, where space is so tight I can barely close the door on the stacked machines that I jammed in there. They hulk, stupidly, among other random items including the vacuum, an empty guitar case and a weird bed coverlet known as “the meat blanket” because its mottled pink-and-white pattern resembles a slice of Mortadella sausage.<br />Worst of all, though, is the washing machine, which smells like mildew because its rubber seal is a moisture trap—a defect I came to learn over the past eight years is common in front loaders, and in this model in particular.<br />So it was actually good news a few weeks ago when the washer broke.<br />“Mrmffk, grnnnn…faulty shut-off valve,” the masked repairman seemed to say through his N95 mask. He also managed to convey to me that fixing the problem would cost upward of $600—nearly as much as I paid for the machine when it was new.</td>

Investors should ask whether this is as good as it gets for a while.<br />The consumer-products giant on Wednesday reported excellent earnings for the three months through December. Organic sales, which adjust for currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 8% from a year earlier. The company raised its sales guidance for the full fiscal year ending in June to a range of 5% to 6% growth from 3% to 4% previously and boosted its share-buyback plans.<br />The maker of Tide detergent, Bounty paper towels and Charmin toilet paper has benefited handsomely from the coronavirus pandemic. And thanks to its diverse portfolio, even categories such as shaving and beauty, not natural beneficiaries of the stay-at-home economy, have performed reasonably well. Grooming, for instance, saw 6% organic sales growth in the quarter thanks to surging sales for appliances like electric razors as consumers continue to shun barbers.<br />Yet P&G shares were basically flat in morning trading and are down around 6% since P&G reported similarly stellar results three months ago. Investors rightly worry that sales of household staples will fall as the pandemic fades and that its shares remain somewhat expensive at 23 times forward earnings, according to FactSet.<br />Perhaps a bigger challenge for the stock is that it doesn’t look like a good fit for any post-pandemic market narrative. In a reflationary boom, it wouldn’t benefit from the likely rotation into value stocks and cyclicals. Under a stagnation scenario it might normally be attractive as a steady dividend payer, but its current 2.4% yield isn’t especially enticing compared with other consumer-staples companies at the moment—particularly food and beverage stocks:  Coca-Cola ’s  yield is 3.4%,  General Mills ’ 3.7%, and  PepsiCo ’s  2.9%.</td>

      <td>President Joe Biden will lead a country with an aging population that is on shakier economic footing and is more politically polarized than at most points in recent years.<br />Key metrics of financial and social well-being show the challenges Mr. Biden faces as he moves into the White House on Wednesday. The coronavirus pandemic halted the 11-year economic expansion and drove up unemployment just as the typical American household was starting to enjoy sustained income growth. Americans were living longer—an improvement from a period when the opioid crisis eroded life expectancy—until the pandemic exacted a swift, deadly toll. One government official said life expectancy could decline by the largest amount since World War II once the government completes last year’s mortality figures.<br />Long-running demographic trends also have shaped the country. The U.S. is becoming more racially diverse. More Americans are obtaining college degrees. Women are having fewer babies, and the population is growing at its lowest rate in over a century.<br />After stagnating in the wake of the 2007-09 recession, America’s earnings gradually improved starting around the middle of the last decade. Median household income was $68,700 in 2019, up 6.8% from the prior year and the highest figure on record. The poverty rate that year dipped to its lowest level since the government began tracking it in 1959. Last year’s figures are expected to show disparities in whose incomes suffered, with some households being better off because of stimulus payments and extra unemployment benefits.<br />The stock market has marched to near-record highs, lifting the net worth of investors while leaving behind the nearly one half of Americans who don’t own stock. Consumer debt has climbed as families have borrowed more heavily to stay in the middle class.</td>

On Tuesday, rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported a fourth-quarter profit that was more than twice as large as year-earlier results and annual revenue that was at an 11-year high.<br />With its focus on wealthy Americans and big corporations and money managers, Morgan Stanley is less exposed to mass unemployment and small-business closures than more Main Street banks.<br />Stock- and bond-trading revenue at Morgan Stanley rose 32% to $4.22 billion.

      <td>Miguel Ríos had a bustling business running four karaoke bars in Barcelona until the coronavirus forced him to shut them. He took out bank loans worth €80,000, equivalent to $96,000, put his 10 employees on a government wage-support program and hoped for the best.<br />Almost a year later, with doors still closed, Mr. Ríos worries his business will fold, leaving him with a pile of debt and exposing his banks to losses. “We are resisting thanks to savings and bank loans, but we can’t keep like this much longer,” the 59-year-old entrepreneur said.<br />His story is echoed across Europe as small businesses fight to stay afloat through the pandemic. Their survival is key for the region’s banks, which together have over €2 trillion on loan to them—40% of the lenders’ entire business loan books.<br />Overall, lenders have considerably cleaned up bad loans from the previous crisis, but many are still stuck with souring portfolios. They are also struggling to make money in a negative-rates environment.<br />Regulators fear a new—and potentially bigger—wave of defaults could send banks scrambling to cover losses. Weaker ones could require state help to survive. Andrea Enria, the head of banking supervision at the European Central Bank, has warned that bad loans in the eurozone could soar to as high as €1.4 trillion—more than during the aftermath of the financial crisis—if the economy contracts more than expected.</td>

      <td>Burberry’s turnaround plans are seen as less convincing than a similar push at Prada</td>
      <td>Investors don’t want to miss out on the luxury sector’s next Gucci-style brand turnaround. Still, their strong preference for  Prada  SpA over  Burberry  Group, both of which are in the middle of revamps, is a puzzle.<br />On Wednesday, Burberry said comparable retail sales fell 9% in its most recent quarter compared with the prior-year period. Even though the numbers were weaker than analysts expected, there are also early signs that the company’s efforts to shift more stock at full price are beginning to pay off. If the British trench-coat brand can reduce the number of products it has to sell at a discount, profit margins should improve.<br />Burberry stock rose slightly in European morning trading, but it still has a long way to go to catch up with Prada. The Milanese label is the best-performing large luxury stock of the past 12 months, gaining 67%, while Burberry is one of the worst. Prada’s shares have traditionally been more expensive than its British peer’s, but the premium has skyrocketed in recent months.<br />There isn’t much hard evidence yet to justify investors’ faith in Prada. Earlier this month, the company said its retail sales fell 6% in the second half of 2020—better than Burberry’s latest numbers, but not by much. True, there are some indications that Prada is getting more attention on social media. It ranked fourth in a recent Citi Brand Heat Tracker, while Burberry languished in 14th place. The question is whether this will translate into meaningful market-share gains as more consumers emerge from lockdowns this year.<br />Investors may favor Prada because its operating margins have been high in the past, peaking at 27% almost a decade ago. The business hasn’t been that lucrative in years, but as the Italian label makes a bigger cut of sales from highly profitable handbags, shareholders may be betting it can return to those highs. Burberry, by contrast, has a heritage in clothing, where margins are lower. Takeover speculation could also explain excitement about Prada, although its controlling shareholder has said the brand isn’t for sale.</td>

      <td>Athletes arrive as country reduces the number of international arrivals allowed</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—International tennis stars jetted into Australia last week from some of the world’s worst coronavirus hot spots. At the same time, ordinary Australians were prohibited from traveling between the country’s two biggest cities because of a small outbreak in one of them.<br />Australia’s tough border controls have been credited with helping the country to contain the coronavirus. Now, Australia’s decision to let hundreds of tennis players into the country ahead of the Australian Open, one of the biggest tennis tournaments in the world, is serving up a public debate on whether some people are getting preferential treatment.<br />“It feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth,” said Julie Land, 42 years old, who has been trying to return to Australia from the U.S. with her family and will have to wait until at least March for an available flight. “Cricket players, tennis entourages and celebrities seem to have no issues at all accessing Australia.”<br />How Australia balances the needs of athletes with anger from some members of the public could offer lessons for other global sports tournaments due to be held this year. Japan, another country with a low number of coronavirus cases by international standards, is scheduled to host the Olympics in July, after they were postponed last year.<br />The tournament is an economic driver for Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city. Last year, more than 800,000 people attended, and organizers estimated that about $300 million was injected into the local economy. Broadcasts of the tournament reached more than 900 million homes globally.</td>

      <td>Can we face a bear market even if the economy booms? Yes, but it would be rare.</td>
      <td>We keep being reminded that the stock market isn’t the economy. But then, is it possible for the market to go into a long bear run even if the economy booms? Yes, although there is little record of it ever happening.<br />U.S. stocks’ performance over the past year has been more than breathtaking. Even though the U.S. economy is in decidedly worse shape than it was before the Covid-19 crisis started, with millions of Americans still out of work, stocks quickly rebounded from their spring selloff and surged to new highs. Valuations have touched levels seen only in the years surrounding the dot-com bubble and in the run-up to the 1929 crash.<br />It is an apt example of how the stock market’s link to the economy can be as thin as tissue paper. Even the idea that stocks are pricing in an expected boom in the economy once the pandemic passes is looking pretty flimsy as stocks don’t just look rich versus analysts’ expected 2021 earnings but versus expected earnings in 2022.<br />If stocks can be so divorced from the economy as it struggles through the coronavirus crisis, they also can be detached from it when the pandemic lessens its grip. With another round of fiscal support looking likely, and vaccinations under way, economists have been marking up their economic growth forecasts for this year. There is no rule that says that should send stocks higher, though.<br />To some extent stocks might have done well not just despite the pandemic, but because of it. The big companies represented in the major stock indexes were, in large part, less affected than many small businesses. Goods sectors such as manufacturing, which are a bigger part of the market than of the economy as a whole, have fared better than services. So it might be businesses underrepresented in the stock market that are the bigger beneficiaries of a better economy this year.</td>

The company also logged higher revenue from products, services and investment income than it did in the year-ago quarter.<br />As more people returned to medical providers for care that they had avoided or postponed earlier in the pandemic, UnitedHealth’s costs rose as well.

      <td>A Democratic majority in both chambers of Congress, even with narrow margins, could open the door to some potentially transformative clean-energy policies</td>
      <td>The narrow Democratic Party majority in Congress might close the door on some of President-elect Joe Biden’s most ambitious clean-energy proposals, but it opens one up for tax-policy changes. That alone could supercharge the industry.<br />Tax and spending measures can pass through a simple majority in the Senate through a budget-reconciliation process, which is why many industry watchers are focused on it. Notably, there are tax provisions that passed the Democrat-controlled House in July but never made it onto the Senate’s agenda when it was Republican-controlled.<br />One such measure worth watching includes an investment tax credit for energy storage. Keith Martin, a partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, notes that the provision is well-developed and has momentum behind it. Today, energy storage qualifies for the tax credits only if it is paired with solar energy, and there are finicky rules to prove eligibility. Such rules have meant battery systems that exist solely for grid services, for example, were shut out entirely.<br />An investment tax credit for energy storage has been on the clean-energy industry’s wish list for years and is a potential game-changer. The lack of cheap storage remains one of the key bottlenecks to a grid that relies primarily on intermittent solar and wind energy. Though battery technologies have become cheaper over the years, tax credits would increase its competitiveness. A tax credit for stand-alone energy storage could translate to 16% growth in the U.S. energy-storage market, according to a Wood Mackenzie report from 2019. The Solar Energy Industry Association credits the same subsidy for allowing the solar industry to grow by more than 10,000% since it was enacted in 2006.<br />Another potential measure is a longer extension of existing renewable tax credits. While a stimulus bill passed in late December included one-year and two-year extensions for tax credits commonly used by onshore wind- and solar-power plants, respectively, the House infrastructure bill passed last year included a five-year extension for both. A further extension could be a relatively easy win given that renewable tax credits have a history of receiving bipartisan support. Experience has shown that longer visibility on tax credits allows the industry to grow without sudden stops.</td>

All for the purpose of securing the necessary capacity for the latest standard of wireless networking known as 5G.<br />Much remains undisclosed at the moment, including how much each carrier bid for what slices of spectrum. But analysts agree that  AT&T  and  Verizon  likely paid the most—because they needed the most. A trio of brokers who published estimates on Tuesday averaged a guess of $22 billion in total final bids from AT&T and $42 billion from Verizon, including the clearing costs.  T-Mobile ,  which already has a strong 5G spectrum position thanks to last year’s merger with Sprint, is estimated to have spent around $10 billion. Full results from the auction aren’t expected to be public until sometime next month.<br />Winning the licenses is one thing; paying for them is another. AT&T currently has the fifth-highest dividend yield on the S&P 500, according to FactSet. It also has a pressing need to invest in its Hollywood operations that include the HBO Max streaming service. Doug Mitchelson of  Credit Suisse  wrote Tuesday that AT&T may need to find incremental asset sales to offset its spectrum bill, lest the carrier’s credit rating get downgraded to something close to junk status. Verizon isn’t under the same kind of pressure, but Mr. Mitchelson predicted that stock buybacks at Verizon are “now off the table for years.”<br />There also is the question of making 5G pay off. So far, the performance of those services hasn’t lived up to years of hype from carriers. A survey by UBS in October found that 5G ranked “among low priorities” of smartphone users—below that of battery life and other functions. Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson notes that 5G revenue forecasts aren’t going up just because the spectrum costs came in much higher than expected. Those carriers also will still need to invest the necessary capital expenditures to make use of the spectrum. “Winning” the government’s recent auction may turn into more of a Pyrrhic victory.</td>

      <td>Markets where vaccines are rolled out rapidly may be beneficiaries, but the greater impact could be on the laggards</td>
      <td>The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is finally under way. Markets are already showing that the speed of local rollouts matters quite a bit—but global vaccination campaigns will also ripple through financial markets in some unexpected ways, including in places that have successfully controlled the disease.<br />It is difficult to pin down the precise impact of vaccine deployment so far. In the past month, while the MSCI All Country World Index is up by 3.3%, benchmark equity indexes in Israel and Dubai, two places with among the fastest vaccine rollouts globally, are up by around 8% apiece. Clearly vaccines aren’t everything though: The Bahrain All Share Index is down a little more than 2% over the same period, despite a rapid rollout.<br />Markets where vaccines are rolled out rapidly may be beneficiaries, but the greater impact may be on the laggards. Hospitality, travel and bank stocks are key areas on which to concentrate.<br />The MSCI World Banks Index has clearly been a major beneficiary of vaccine-related good news this winter: The index’s gain since the beginning of 2020 still lags behind the broad MSCI World by 22 percentage points. But it has clawed back more than a third of the 35 percentage-point gap that existed in mid-October.<br />As deployment continues, the difficult question of whether some vaccines are more effective than others also will come to the fore. Late-stage trial data from Brazil suggest that the Sinovac vaccine, CoronaVac, met the World Health Organization’s benchmark for widespread use by a whisker, with an efficacy rate of 50.4%.</td>

      <td>Organizers of the Tokyo Olympics face a long list of obstacles as they attempt to carry off the postponed Games in six months—and the alarming rise in Covid cases around the world recently is only one of them.<br />Potentially bigger hurdles include the need to speed up Covid-19 vaccinations globally and in the U.S. and convincing a skeptical Japanese public to accept vaccines and welcome thousands of visitors from around the globe.<br />The International Olympic Committee and organizers in Japan last March delayed the Games from 2020 to 2021, a move that came about four months before the event was set to begin. They are now closing in on the same decision-making window for 2021, with last year’s problems still in play and a few new ones that have surfaced as the pandemic has continued.<br />Vaccinations—for the hosts, athletes and spectators—are a big topic.<br />Although Olympic organizers have said they won’t require vaccines for fans and athletes coming to the Games, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has said he wants almost everyone in Japan vaccinated by the Olympics’ July 23 start. Japan has secured enough vaccines to inoculate all of its population, though none has yet received local regulatory approval and the country hasn’t started vaccinations.</td>

Now, the U.K. hopes it is turning the tide, thanks to a homegrown vaccine that has yet to be authorized elsewhere in the West.<br />More than four million of the most at-risk people in the U.K., almost 8% of the adult population, have been vaccinated with at least one shot of vaccine.<br />Among them are more than half of the frailest group of all: the 300,000 elderly residents of nursing homes who can’t travel to get a shot. The key to reaching them has been mobile vaccination teams armed with a shot developed by the University of Oxford and  AstraZeneca  PLC.<br />Together with a network of family doctors and vaccination hubs in sports centers, hotels and cathedrals, this shot has helped the country to stay on track toward a target of vaccinating its 15 million most vulnerable people by mid-February.<br />The government says the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has also been authorized in India, Morocco and some countries in Latin America, has been a game changer in reaching people tucked away in smaller nursing homes.</td>

The group acquired the annuities unit in 2018 from  Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.<br />Sixth Street, a former affiliate of private-equity firm TPG, has amassed one of the biggest pools of private capital on record.

Ultralow interest rates have prompted much of the activity, hurting insurers’ profits. One of the biggest of the postcrisis upstarts is  Athene Holding Ltd. , backed by  Apollo Global Management Inc.  and now a large publicly traded insurer.</td>

      <td>The action comes under the Deferred Enforced Departure program that offers deportation protections and work permits to immigrants in the country without authorization</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—As one of his final acts in office, President Trump has authorized a program to give work permits and deportation protections to Venezuelan immigrants in the U.S. without legal permission, an action President-elect Joe Biden had promised to take during the 2020 campaign.<br />The designation formally known as Deferred Enforced Departure offers legal protections to any Venezuelan national present in the U.S. as of Jan. 20, 2021, for 18 months. That is likely to benefit at least 94,000 Venezuelans in the country without authorization as of 2018, according to the Migration Policy Institute, though analysts believe the current number is likely higher.<br />Mr. Trump’s move is seen as a form of pressure the U.S. government can use against Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan authoritarian leader whom the Trump administration has targeted with sanctions, a limited travel ban and other measures. In Jan. 2019, the U.S. officially recognized the country’s opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as Venezuela’s interim president.<br />During the 2020 campaign, Mr. Biden said he would offer Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelan immigrants should he win the election, addressing a major ask of the Venezuelan-American community in Florida that he was courting. TPS is roughly identical to the Deferred Enforced Departure program in the protections it offers. DED is issued directly by a president, while TPS must be approved by the Homeland Security secretary.<br />Republicans and Democrats in Florida have been lobbying for the move—south Florida is home to one of the largest Venezuelan populations in the U.S.—and the White House has long waffled over whether to take the step.</td>

But in a briefing for reporters, they clarified earlier updates by revealing that the testing setback resulted from the combination of a malfunctioning sensor and how Saturday’s test was set up rather than design or production defects with the engines themselves.<br />Outgoing National Aeronautics and Space Administration chief Jim Bridenstine and some top aides emphasized that on top of probable schedule delays, extra testing could stress parts of the 212-foot rocket to the point that performing its mission could be problematic.<br />The agency didn’t give a timeline for a decision, though some of its internal safety guidelines suggest that typically a new test would be necessary to demonstrate reliability of the booster’s primary propulsion system.<br />The looming trade-offs over testing present engineering and political challenges for NASA as well as Boeing, even as new appointees in a Biden administration are expected to reassess the status of the troubled multibillion-dollar SLS program.</td>

I’m glad to hear it. My focus has been and will continue to be working for the people of North Carolina during this difficult time for our nation.”<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation began looking into reports in March that several members of Congress, their spouses or their investment advisers sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock after lawmakers attended closed-door briefings about the threat posed by the virus as it was beginning to reach the U.S. Some of those trades spared lawmakers as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses as stocks sank by mid-March.<br />Mr. Burr, who sat on two committees that received detailed briefings on the growing pandemic, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, which he had chaired, had sold shares of companies valued at as much as $1.7 million, which he owned with his wife. The sale saved the couple at least $250,000 in losses based on what those stocks were worth at the close of trading March 19, the Journal reported at the time.<br />Mr. Burr had said he made the trades based on news reports out of Asia rather than any inside information he had received, but he stepped down from his post as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee while the investigation continued.</td>

It also reflected Mr. Pai’s skill for navigating politically perilous rules for cellular networks, television broadcasters and big media mergers—topics about which the president often opined.<br />“It’s very important for the FCC chair to maintain its independence because otherwise, instead of putting your finger on the problem, you’re putting your finger in the wind,” Mr. Pai said Tuesday. “That’s not a good place to be for any independent leader.”<br />Mr. Pai, a Republican who spent years as a commissioner before becoming the first Indian American to lead the telecom regulator, will leave office Wednesday before the inauguration of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden. The departing official oversaw a collection of networks that grew bigger, faster and more varied over the past four years.<br />The telecom-industry veteran took the top job in 2017 with a promise to cut red tape holding back network investments. He started by rewriting his predecessor’s rules governing internet privacy and net neutrality, a concept that encourages broadband providers to carry all lawful internet data alike. Many changes dismayed Democrats but withstood repeated court challenges, fulfilling the Republican official’s pledge to make regulations more predictable.</td>

The first wave of applications was largely handled by community and small lenders after the SBA set aside time for them to process the loans exclusively.<br />The program’s restart comes as many small businesses continue to struggle with the fallout from the pandemic. One-third of small businesses surveyed between Jan. 4 and Jan. 10 said they would need financial assistance or additional capital in the next six months, according to the Census Bureau, up from nearly 25% in mid-November.<br />“It’s encouraging to see that kind of volume go out the door, especially knowing that it can only go up from here,” said John Lettieri, chief executive of the nonprofit Economic Innovation Group. But small businesses have waited for a long time for that lifeline and some that could have been salvaged have failed, he said.<br />The average PPP loan size was below $20,000 for first-time borrowers and below $75,000 for second-time borrowers for applications processed through Jan. 17, according to an SBA spokesman, a sign the loans were being approved for smaller businesses. Loan amounts are based on the size of an applicant’s payroll.</td>

      <td>Streaming giant tempers subscriber outlook with surprising cash flow projection</td>
      <td>All its years in Hollywood have clearly taught  Netflix  the value of tweaking the screenplay.<br />Wall Street’s script for Netflix has been simple to date: a singular focus on user numbers. And the streaming giant has clearly delivered on that recently, thanks in part to the pandemic that confined people to their homes. The company said Tuesday that it added a record 36.5 million paid subscribers in 2020, with fourth-quarter additions of 8.5 million subscribers beating its own projection by 42%. Over the previous five years, Netflix had averaged about 22.5 million paid subscriber additions annually.<br />But the unique circumstances of Netflix’s recent pace mean it is very unlikely to continue. Indeed, Netflix projected only 6 million subscriber additions for the first quarter, matching the low end of Wall Street’s forecasts. But the company offset the disappointment with the target of breaking even on a free-cash-flow basis this year, compared with its earlier projection of burning as much as $1 billion. The company even bolded a claim in its quarterly letter to shareholders that it believes it will no longer need to raise external financing for its day-to-day operations. Its shares were up more than 13% following the report.<br />The reaction suggests Netflix and its investors are ready to grow up a bit. The company has burned cash since 2013 in a race to build up exclusive content on the correct assumption that studios that produced top-flight programming would eventually create their own streaming outlets. That has played out vividly over the past 18 months with the launch of services such as Disney+, HBO Max and Peacock. New rivals also have cost Netflix access to popular comfort-viewing programs such as “Friends” and “The Office.”<br />Fortunately, Netflix now has plenty of popular shows of its own. Moreover, the company’s tenure in streaming gives it unique insight into what audiences actually want to see. Who else would have given the green light to a hit show with washed-up “Karate Kid” characters?</td>

      <td>By his own instincts, or the desires of his party’s progressives?</td>
      <td>Joe Biden begins his Presidency at a moment of deep political division, but paradoxically this gives him a rare opportunity. No doubt his Inaugural Address will echo his campaign theme of unity and healing, but his success in that mission will depend on resisting the divisive progressive domination sought by his party’s left.<br />Mr. Biden has been around long enough to appreciate the good fortune that has brought him to the Oval Office. Covid-19 accentuated Donald Trump’s leadership flaws and ruined the strong pre-pandemic economy. Mr. Biden was going nowhere in the Democratic primaries until Bernie Sanders emerged as the front-runner and the party turned to the former Vice President in political desperation.<br />Now as he takes office, the vaccines are rolling out and the economy is ready to soar once the Covid scourge eases. He will get political credit for the rebound simply by being there as the pandemic pall lifts. Unlike a Republican, Mr. Biden will also have nearly all of the media and the commanding heights of American culture behind him. A majority of Americans want an end to the furious rancor of recent years, and Mr. Biden is poised to benefit.<br />Left to his own political instincts, Mr. Biden could be the man for this moment. He is a moderate liberal with sympathy for the working class who is inclined to reach across the political aisle. With a 50-50 Senate and a narrow House majority, he also has good practical reason to do so. At 78 years old, he realizes he is likely to serve only one term and could create an admirable legacy as the man who calmed the Trump-era furies. That, at least, is our hopeful case for the Biden years.<br />Yet Mr. Biden also comes to power with a Democratic Party whose ascendant progressives have other ideas. Their goal is to use the federal government as a battering ram to drive economic and cultural “transformation.” Progressives in the House and Senate, urged on by the Democratic media complex and Silicon Valley, view the defeat of Donald Trump as the opening to assert a new level of government control over the economy and cultural dominance over American society.</td>

      <td>Have the social-media platforms gone too far or acted too late? Students debate.</td>
      <td>Editor’s note: This week’s Future View discusses censorship on social media. For next week, we’ll ask students to make the case for one policy change that Joe Biden should prioritize in his first 100 days in office. Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Jan. 26. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Tell the Truth<br />There are three dominant narratives on the social-media censorship. The first is that social-media companies are private enterprises and should be able to censor speech as they deem fit. The second is that social media has become so vital to the exercise of speech that it has become part of the public square. And just as a town clerk isn’t allowed to deny a permit to a demonstration because he finds its subject matter objectionable, so too social-media companies must be constrained from censoring speech. The third also begins with the premise that social media has become highly influential, but concludes that platforms have a duty to stamp out whatever they (frequently progressives) find unsavory. That town clerk should take a stand and deny the permit.<br />I’d emphasize the private nature of social-media companies, and add that they should be held to their own standards. If they profess to be grand, benevolent platforms that are welcoming to all, then they should behave accordingly by allowing disagreeable speech to flourish. If, however, they purport to be platforms for progressive speech, then censoring conservatives is their prerogative. Content moderation is fine, as long as companies are honest with themselves—and us.</td>

      <td>Donald Trump’s Presidency ends on Wednesday at noon, as the Constitution stipulates. One question to ponder is who will miss him more—his friends or his foes?<br />Our guess is the latter. And if you doubt it, consider the chat between Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton Monday on Mrs. Clinton’s “You and Me Both” podcast. They’re addicted to the man.<br />“I would love to see [Mr. Trump’s] phone records to see whether he was talking to Putin the day that the insurgents invaded our Capitol,” Mrs. Clinton said. The former first lady, who has never accepted the results of the 2016 election, is immune to the irony that in claiming he really won the election President Trump is following her pre-election advice to Joe Biden to “not concede under any circumstance.”<br />Mrs. Pelosi said during the podcast that she once told Mr. Trump that “with you, Mr. President, all roads lead to Putin.” She added that the Capitol rioters “were doing Putin’s business when they did that at the incitement of an insurrection by the President of the United States.” When Mrs. Clinton asked whether the country needs “a 9/11-type commission to investigate and report everything that they can pull together,” Mrs. Pelosi responded “I do.” Though she says she doesn’t know what it is, she suggested Mr. Putin must have something on him “politically, financially or personally.”<br />Maybe they should have a special counsel spend years investigating Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia. Wait, they already did that.</td>

      <td>Biden’s Treasury nominee adapts and extends her views.</td>
      <td>We have our policy disagreements with Janet Yellen, but there’s no denying she is a fine economist. So it was startling to hear her speak like a fact-hedging politician on Tuesday during her Senate confirmation hearing to be Joe Biden’s Treasury secretary. To wit, she did some on-the-fly editing of the economic literature to justify an increase in the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.<br />“Very minimal,” Ms. Yellen said in reply to a question by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott about the employment impact of Mr. Biden’s proposal to raise the federal minimum to $15 from $7.25. As evidence, she cited studies comparing employment in states that raised their minimum wage with neighboring ones that didn’t.<br />But those studies have yielded conflicting findings, and the economic literature overwhelmingly shows that raising the minimum wage reduces employment among teens and unskilled or inexperienced workers. Ms. Yellen acknowledged as much during a Congressional hearing in 2014 when she was asked about Barack Obama’s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10.<br />“I think almost all economists think that the minimum wage has two main effects,” she replied. One is increasing pay for some low-paid workers, and the second is “there would be some amount of negative impact on employment.” How much is a matter of “considerable debate,” she said, adding that she “wouldn’t argue” with the Congressional Budget Office estimate that Mr. Obama’s hike would cost 500,000 jobs.<br />That impact won’t be “very minimal” if you’re among those who might have had one of those 500,000 lost jobs. And that number is likely to increase substantially if the minimum wage more than doubles to $15.</td>

Things were terrible; there was wreckage all around, and yet a sense of optimism must have been pervasive.<br />One part of our long national nightmare ends Wednesday as Donald Trump slinks off to Mar-a-Lago in disgrace, and Joe Biden takes over as president. Yet Mr. Trump leaves behind a second national nightmare: a raging pandemic and, largely for that reason, a sputtering economy.<br />When it comes to handling the pandemic, Mr. Trump has set the bar very low. Doing a better job than his predecessor will be a piece of cake for Mr. Biden. But “better” is not nearly good enough when record numbers of Americans are falling ill and dying. Mr. Biden must do vastly better. His comprehensive plans suggest that he will.<br />Public health is not my bailiwick, so I’ll concentrate on the economics. The national economy today is in passable shape given the unfolding health catastrophe, and the Cares Act of March 2020 is one major reason why. The law showed that Congress had learned two crucial lessons about fighting crises: Go fast, and go big. The Cares Act did both—and as a result it wasn’t as meticulously designed as it could have been.<br />There’s a third lesson: Don’t withdraw emergency support too soon. Mr. Biden clearly understands all three.</td>

      <td>Facebook and Twitter once positioned themselves as champions of an open internet. No longer.</td>
      <td>Social-media giants are under attack for censorship, but a few years ago they positioned themselves as champions of free speech. At issue was “net neutrality,” the Obama-era policy that treated internet service providers like  Comcast  and  AT&T  as common carriers—akin to the old Ma Bell monopoly—by prohibiting them from discriminating among content providers, including the social-media sites.<br />“Net neutrality is the idea that the internet should be free and open for everyone,”  Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerbergdeclared in July 2017 after the Federal Communications Commission’s then-chairman, Ajit Pai, moved to repeal the regulation, which the FCC had adopted two years earlier.  Twitter ’s  public-policy manager, Laura Culbertson, wrote: “Free expression is part of our company DNA. We are the platform that lets users see what’s happening and to see all sides. . . . Without Net Neutrality in force, ISPs would even be able to block content they don’t like, reject apps and content that compete with their own offerings, and arbitrarily discriminate against particular content providers by prioritizing certain Internet traffic over theirs.”<br />Facebook and Twitter turned out to be more threatening than under threat. Broadband providers haven’t attempted to block content or competitors since the FCC repealed net neutrality. But social media, app stores and cloud providers, which were never subject to the rules, all have engaged in censorship repeatedly in recent weeks.<br />Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat moved in lockstep to shut down Donald Trump’s accounts. Google and  Apple  banned the social-media app Parler, which promotes itself as a free-speech alternative to Twitter.  Amazon  Web Services booted Parler from its cloud, banishing it from the web until it could arrange service from another provider.<br />Appeals by big tech companies to protect an “open and free Internet” were always dubious. They had an interest in supporting net neutrality because it put them at an advantage. Among other things, the rule prohibited broadband providers from charging bandwidth guzzlers like Google’s YouTube, Amazon and Facebook more to upload their content at faster speeds.</td>

      <td>Long-running battle involves concerns about racial and gender diversity</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday stepped into the middle of a long-running battle over federal limits on media ownership in local markets, weighing whether a recent regulatory rollback sufficiently addressed concerns about racial and gender diversity.<br />At issue was the Federal Communications Commission’s 2017 decision to loosen ownership restrictions by making it easier for one entity to own multiple TV stations in the same market. The rollback also repealed bans on common ownership of both a TV station and a newspaper in the same market, or a TV station and a radio station.<br />Some ownership limits had been in place for decades, to prevent concentration and preserve viewpoint diversity in local markets.<br />A federal appeals court in 2019 found the FCC didn’t satisfy its legal obligation to determine whether the rollback was in the public interest—because it didn’t adequately assess whether the changes would harm ownership of broadcast media by women and minorities. The FCC and a group of media companies, including  News Corp ,  owner of The Wall Street Journal, appealed to the high court.<br />During an hour-long oral argument, justices pressed both sides in the dispute, but several appeared sympathetic to claims by the FCC and the media companies that the old limits were outdated and didn’t take into account a changing media landscape.</td>

      <td>For President Washington, holding public ofﬁce was a responsibility assumed, not an opportunity exploited.</td>
      <td>It ranks with the filibuster and the chaplain’s prayer among the hoariest traditions of the United States Senate: Every year since 1896, on or about Feb. 22, a member reads into the record George Washington’s Farewell Address. Washington’s prose, as honed by his ghostwriters James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, does not easily translate into the parlance of soundbite politics. But the dangers identified by the retiring president—excessive partisanship, sectional over national loyalties, misplaced allegiance to foreign powers—are as contemporary as the latest tweetstorm.<br />According to Stephen Howard Browne, a professor of communications at Penn State, the lawmakers may be listening to the wrong speech. To Mr. Browne it is Washington’s first inaugural address, delivered on April 30, 1789, that offers a classic defense of republican virtue as the linchpin of popular government. “I walk on untrodden ground,” the new president there acknowledged, his every action defining the scope of executive authority for all who would follow. In the years since, countless writers have retraced his footsteps, leading Mr. Browne himself to wonder: “Have we not had quite enough of George Washington?”<br />The question answers itself in this deceptively slender volume, in which Mr. Browne skillfully synthesizes biography, travelogue, social and political history, and rhetorical analysis to reach fresh conclusions about the relationship between individual and national character. Long before he took the oath of office on the balcony of New York’s Federal Hall, Washington had enshrined duty over self-advancement in his personal code. He demonstrated as much at the close of the Revolution, when mutinous officers in the Continental Army contemplated marching on Congress, until they were shamed out of it by their victorious general.<br />“That Americans have been spared the trauma of the military coup d’état,” writes Mr. Browne, “is owing in no small measure to a general insistent on the privilege of civil authority, who, wielding the sword in battle, laid it down in peace and left it there.” Can there be any stronger proof on this Inauguration Day of Washington’s continuing relevance? For him, no less than for his 20th-century admirer Dwight Eisenhower, the presidency was no promotion. On the eve of his investiture, fearing the toll of public controversy on his reputation, Washington confessed to emotions “as painful . . . as they are pleasing.” That he should nurse such feelings while being rowed across New York Harbor to the deafening cheers of his countrymen says much about this 18th-century idealist without illusions.<br />Hero worship exacted a high price, as Mr. Browne illustrates in tracking Washington’s triumphal two-week “inaugural journey” from Mount Vernon, Va., to New York City. Since visits from local notables would inconvenience private homeowners, the traveler opted to stay in “public houses” everywhere along his route. In Philadelphia, a massive parade ushered him down Market Street to City Tavern and yet another celebratory dinner, culminating in a toast (his 14th of the evening) to “government without oppression, and liberty without licentiousness.” The author enlivens Washington’s road trip with revealing detours into the president-elect’s spiritual outlook (he reserved his most fervent belief for religious tolerance and faith itself as a bulwark of public order); his attitude toward “the people”; and the seeds of American exceptionalism.</td>

      <td>The left will try to convince Biden he has a mandate for progressive change. He doesn’t.</td>
      <td>When Barack Obama and Joe Biden entered the White House 12 years ago, the economy was in recession, unemployment was pushing 8%, and their fellow Democrats controlled the House and Senate. Sound familiar?<br />We know what happened next. Instead of focusing on economic growth, the Obama administration advanced an expensive but ineffective stimulus package and then went all in on a partisan transformation of the U.S. health-care system. The upshot was the slowest economic recovery since World War II. Democrats lost their House majority in 2010, and Republicans won the Senate four years later.<br />We’re about to find out what, if anything, Mr. Biden and his more liberal allies took away from that experience. Mr. Biden has said that his first order of business as president will be addressing Covid-19 and the economy. What we don’t know is whether the political left intends to let him do that. The progressive wing of the Democratic Party is much stronger than it was in 2009, and its members of Congress are far more numerous. Back then, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren did not command the national attention that they do today, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wasn’t old enough to buy beer.<br />On the campaign trail, Mr. Biden tried to put some rhetorical distance between himself and more radical proposals like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All. It’s a strategy that obviously served him well in the election, but how well will it work for him in the White House?<br />When George W. Bush left office, his job-approval rating was in the mid-30s, and the incoming Obama administration interpreted Mr. Bush’s unpopularity as a mandate for its progressive agenda. That miscalculation cost Democrats control of Congress, and Republicans today are anticipating more such overreach under President Biden. Donald Trump didn’t lose re-election because he pulled out of the Paris climate agreement or prioritized securing the southern border or banned travel to the U.S. from countries with a history of coddling terrorists. Liberals who insist otherwise aren’t only kidding themselves but risk repeating the mistakes of a decade ago.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Alejandro Mayorkas, President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for Homeland Security secretary, told a Senate hearing Tuesday he would work to ensure that an attack like the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol wouldn’t be repeated, though his confirmation by Inauguration Day appeared to be delayed.<br />Mr. Biden’s team had named Mr. Mayorkas as one of a handful of national-security nominees it wanted confirmed on Inauguration Day because of continuing domestic threats. In 2017, the Senate confirmed both President Trump’s homeland security and defense nominees on Inauguration Day. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who is set to become the chamber’s majority leader on Wednesday, said on the Senate floor he hoped Mr. Mayorkas would be confirmed on Inauguration Day.<br />That timeline appeared less likely Tuesday after Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) said he would object to an attempt to fast-track the nomination. Mr. Hawley expressed concern about the incoming Biden administration’s plan to undo much of Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda, along with an expected push to create a pathway to citizenship for 11 million immigrants without a permanent legal status.<br />Mr. Hawley, who was the first senator to announce he would formally object to certifying the election results on Jan. 6, has faced a backlash from colleagues and donors since that day. Many Senate Republicans blame him for what they see as his role in instigating the riot that resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer.<br />Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and Mr. Schumer met Tuesday to iron out details of a power-sharing agreement in a Senate divided evenly along party lines.  Under a similar agreement in 2001, nominees and bills could advance to the floor even if a committee vote tied.</td>

      <td>Chuck Norris’s whompin’ stompin lawman is turned into a soft-spoken hero encumbered by uncertainties.</td>
      <td>If you’re looking for whompin’, stompin’, kung-fu-administered rear-end alignments of the Chuck Norris variety, “Walker” may come as a surprise. It will be an understandable surprise: The show is a reboot, pun intended, of the old Norris vehicle “Walker, Texas Ranger,” in which acting, dramaturgy and plausibility took a back seat to the martial-arts prowess of Mr. Norris, the instant gratification that comes with bad guys being righteously thumped and the moral justification of violence, judiciously applied.<br />In “Walker,” Jared Padalecki (“Supernatural”) plays a far more nuanced edition of Cordell Walker, Texas ranger—lawman, father and widower, though not necessarily in that order; Walker’s priorities are poised to be a central part of the series’ plotlines and motivations. Where Mr. Norris was largely impenetrable, Mr. Padalecki is a wide-open book, riven with uncertainties, apt to make the wrong move. His Walker is established as something quite unusual: a law-and-order hero with no sense of authority.<br />This may well change, as only the pilot was available to review and, as with most new shows, the introductory episode is hampered by the task of having to introduce everything. That said, the show’s creator, Anna Fricke, might have done this more tidily. The opening moments of the first episode involve the death of Walker’s wife, Emily (Genevieve Padalecki), under circumstances that go unexplained, as do the man’s anguished cries when he hears gunshots over her cellphone while appearing otherwise paralyzed into inaction. The next thing we know, we’ve leapt ahead, to an evening in which Walker is late for his own welcome-home party, an event that provides some shorthand on the rest of the cast and their interrelationships, but not on where Walker’s been, why or for how long. He mutters something about “more than a month,” someone else later says “three months” but it’s hard to tell: All this soft-spoken Texas muttering may be regionally authentic, but it doesn’t help with the details.<br />Everyone’s mad at Walker, at any rate, especially his kids, Stella (Violet Brinson) and Augie (Kale Culley), since he seems to have disappeared right after their mother died. Not only has Mr. Padalecki’s character thus been cast as less than forthright and take-charge, it is suggested that he ran away at precisely the time his kids needed him. Rather than rush home to see them when he gets back from his mysterious mission, he parks his enormous pickup truck in a public park. Where he starts drinking. Only to be taken into custody by State Trooper Micki Ramirez (Lindsey Morgan), who, just coincidentally, is about the become a Texas Ranger and—gasp—Walker’s partner.<br />The moral grayness of “Walker” will give the show’s writers no end of material, especially since the series seems positioned to be family friendly, moralistic, vaguely Christian and averse to the kind of mayhem that distinguished the program’s predecessor: Walker does beat down one deserving, smart-mouthed drug smuggler, but then gets chastised by everyone including his supervisor (Coby Bell) and has to promise to be better. You have to ask yourself, what would Chuck Norris do?</td>

      <td>Thirty years ago, John Lurie, the musician, composer, actor and personification of “downtown” New York—when “downtown” meant something culturally specific—had a television series called “Fishing With John.” It masqueraded, with little discernible effort, as a nature-sports program, but was really about Mr. Lurie and his “guests,” who were his friends and collaborators: Jim Jarmusch, Tom Waits, Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon, Dennis Hopper. The show lasted six episodes, but attained a cult following and is available in a Criterion Collection edition and on Criterion Channel.<br />Mr. Lurie’s new show, “Painting With John,” is a very different kind of show—part one-man chat show, part art class—albeit with a similar attitude toward TV genres. Talking into a camera like it’s a real person?, he asks. It’s so artificial. It’s so wrong. “People who can actually do it well?” he says in episode 3. “They’re probably sociopaths.” In fact, he says that the more shows he has done in the series, the better he’s gotten at it, and “the worse and worse person I’ve become.”<br />Clearly, the six-episode season is not out to seduce it’s audience with warmth and fuzziness, but the pacing, the insouciance, the music (Mr. Lurie’s) and the surprising vividness of the colors and the artwork make for a show that engages a viewer sincerely, even while being a semi-spoof: The first episode is called “Bob Ross Was Wrong” (meaning “Everyone can’t paint”). And though Mr. Lurie says he intended the show to be “educational,” he’s an intuitive painter and how can you teach intuition?<br />It’s the kind of question that leads him to tell stories—about his parents for instance, and how they never stifled the creative impulses of him or his brother and fellow musician Evan, who as a young child would assume a character such as Rin-Tin-Tin and “demand to have his dinner served to him on the floor in a bowl.” They never scolded him, but rather played along. (“Rin-Tin-Tin! It’s time for dinner!”) In ways both roundabout and very direct, Mr. Lurie is turning a show whose sensibility is casual into something instructive, without pedantry, or technical expertise: Each episode begins with Mr. Lurie crashing his drone (or seven, at one point) in an attempt to provide an introductory overview of the undisclosed Caribbean island he calls home. At one point he asks why’s he’s doing the show at all. “In fact, if you’re watching, turn it off.” I couldn’t oblige.<br />The show has three essential elements: island scenery; Mr. Lurie’s stories; and his various works in progress—paintings that combine mosaic-like fragments made of oil or watercolor and suggest Gustav Klimt with the delicate flora of a Japanese Edo-period landscape. The act of painting is absorbing in its delicacy; the programs in their entirety are haiku-like—short, seemingly spontaneous, but in fact precisely constructed. (It is a one-man show save for occasional appearances by Nesrin Wolf and Ann Mary Gludd Jones, who work for Mr. Lurie and perhaps live with him.)</td>

      <td>Tech giant will host cloud services for GM’s autonomous-vehicle subsidiary; financing brings Cruise’s valuation to $30 billion</td>
      <td>Microsoft Corp.  is investing in  General Motors Co. ’s driverless-car startup Cruise as part of a strategic tie-up, another sign of renewed interest in the autonomous-technology space after a relatively quiet period.<br />Microsoft is among a group of companies that will invest more than $2 billion in San Francisco-based Cruise, which has been majority-owned by GM since early 2016. The financing brings Cruise’s valuation to $30 billion, Cruise said Tuesday, up from an estimated $19 billion in spring 2019.<br />GM is adding to its Cruise investment as part of the funding round and will retain a majority stake, a Cruise spokesman said. The investment also includes current stakeholder  Honda Motor Co.  and other institutional investors that Cruise declined to name.<br />Under terms of Tuesday’s deal, Cruise will use Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing service to help it roll out autonomous-vehicle services. Cruise for years has been testing driverless cars in San Francisco and plans an eventual robot-taxi service. It is also is exploring commercial delivery.<br />Driverless cars are expected to throw off troves of data for autonomous-service operators to capture, store and eventually monetize, analysts say. Even on today’s cars, auto makers and tech companies are mobilizing to harness data from the growing number of vehicles with internet connections.</td>

      <td>New directive, aimed at a 2020 Supreme Court ruling, comes in the waning moments of the Trump administration</td>
      <td>The Justice Department has issued a memo that aims to limit the impact of a landmark Supreme Court ruling that protects gay and transgender people in the workplace, a last-minute attempt by the Trump administration to influence policy as President-elect Joe Biden begins assembling new leadership at the agency.<br />The Supreme Court’s June ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County said a bedrock federal civil-rights law prohibits employers from discriminating against workers on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The 6-3 opinion, written by a Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch, rejected the administration’s arguments that federal civil rights law provides no protection to LGBT employees.<br />The new memo, dated Sunday and sent by the acting head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, acknowledges the court’s ruling was sweeping, but says the department should not extend it further to areas such as housing and education, where longstanding gender-based policies on bathrooms and sports teams could come into play. The 23-page memo, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, also suggests that some employers could cite religious beliefs that would allow them to discriminate against LGBT employees.<br />“Unlike racial discrimination, the Supreme Court has never held that a religious employer’s decision not to hire homosexual or transgender persons ‘violates deeply and widely accepted views of elementary justice’ or that the government has a ‘compelling’ interest in the eradication of such conduct,” the memo says.<br />A DOJ spokeswoman didn’t have an immediately comment on the memo.</td>

      <td>Streaming giant said it added a record 37 million subscribers in 2020</td>
      <td>Netflix Inc.  ended last year with more than 200 million subscribers, a milestone powered by consumers left homebound by the coronavirus pandemic and rising demand in international markets where the streaming giant has a head start over many rivals.<br />Netflix on Tuesday said it added more than 8.5 million subscribers on a net basis in the fourth quarter, a gain that surpassed its forecast for the period. Overall, Netflix signed up what it said was a record 37 million subscribers in 2020 and had a total of 203.7 million users when the year finished up.<br />The company’s subscriber count has roughly doubled since the third quarter of 2017, when it first exceeded 100 million paying customers.<br />The pandemic has charged Netflix’s growth as consumer cut back on a range of leisure activities—from dining out and vacations to visiting theaters and concert venues—to comply with lockdown orders and limit the risk of infection. With many people spending more time at home, streaming demand jumped, bolstering Netflix as well as its competitors.<br />The Los Gatos, Calif., company said it generated $6.64 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up from $5.45 billion for the year earlier and exceeding analysts’ forecasts. But profit decreased to $542 million, or $1.19 a share, from $587 million, or $1.30 a share, the year earlier. Analysts predicted $1.36 a share for the latest period, according to FactSet.</td>
