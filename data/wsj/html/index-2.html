      <td>Manhattan district attorney candidates Alvin Bragg and Tali Farhadian Weinstein boast the biggest campaign war chests heading into the final month of the race, state filings show, giving them a potential advantage over a crowded field of contenders trying to spread their message.<br />Ms. Farhadian Weinstein, a former state and federal prosecutor, raised more than twice as much as any of her opponents, bringing in $2.2 million during the latest reporting period between mid-January and May 17. Her campaign said it had raised $4.4 million overall, touting her record as an Obama administration Justice Department official, federal prosecutor and top aide to Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez. She spent $3 million on the campaign since January, the most of any of the eight Democratic candidates.<br />Mr. Bragg, a former federal prosecutor and top New York attorney general official, surpassed her in cash on hand. He had $1.2 million available as of last week, compared with $803,000 for Ms. Farhadian Weinstein. Mr. Bragg has raised $2 million overall and $712,000 over the past four months, his campaign said.<br />More than half of Ms. Farhadian Weinstein’s recent fundraising came from four dozen donors, many of whom work in the financial sector. Some opponents have questioned whether Ms. Farhadian Weinstein could independently lead an office that prosecutes white-collar crime with so many donations from the financial sector. She has said she would prosecute anyone who breaks the law.<br />Eight Democratic candidates are vying to replace incumbent Cyrus Vance Jr., a three-term Democrat who isn’t running for re-election. The winner of the June 22 Democratic primary would be heavily favored to win the November general election.</td>

      <td>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas is poised to remove one of its last gun restrictions after lawmakers approved allowing people to carry handguns without a license, and the background check and training that go with it.<br />The Republican-dominated Legislature approved the measure Monday, sending it to Gov. Greg Abbott, who has said he will sign it despite the objections of law enforcement groups who say it would endanger the public and police.<br />Gun control groups also oppose the measure, noting the state’s recent history of mass shootings, including those at a Walmart in El Paso, a church in Sutherland Springs, and a high school outside Houston, though in each of those attacks, the assailants primarily used assault-style rifles, not handguns.<br />Texas already has some of the loosest gun laws in the country and has more than 1.6 million handgun license holders.<br />Supporters of the bill say it would allow Texans to better defend themselves in public while abolishing unnecessary impediments to the constitutional right to bear arms. Once signed into law, Texas will join nearly two dozen other states that allow some form of unregulated carry of a handgun.</td>

      <td>The Court needs to affirm the principle of racial equality or the U.S. will resegregate.</td>
      <td>Nearly every day we learn of another case of governments or others setting policy based on the color of one’s skin. This is contrary to the equal rights fought for and won in the Civil War and civil-rights movement, and the Supreme Court has a rare and valuable chance to reaffirm that principle if it decides to hear the appeal in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard.<br />The particulars concern whether Harvard discriminates against Asian-Americans in its admissions decisions. Harvard won in the lower courts but the Asian-American plaintiffs have appealed to the High Court. The larger stakes are whether the Supreme Court will wink as America divides in ways that have proved so destructive in the past.<br />The temptation will be for the Justices to give Harvard a pass given its contentious subject. The High Court has already taken cases on gun rights and abortion for the next term starting in the autumn. And you can imagine the reluctance to add the combustible issue of race to the docket.<br />This would be a mistake, and not only on the merits of this case. As Justice Clarence Thomas pointed out in 2018 when the Court passed on Kansas and Louisiana laws involving Medicaid funds for Planned Parenthood clinics, Supreme Court Justices are given lifetime tenure precisely so that a “politically fraught issue” will not prevent them from applying the law neutrally.<br />This is what is at stake in Harvard. In America today the principle that drove the civil-rights movement—equality for all—is fast giving way to the view that race must be a dominant factor in every decision from college admission to eligibility for a federal farm program to the makeup of corporate boards to who gets priority for a Covid vaccine.</td>

      <td>New Jersey comes in it at number one in a new ranking of states. Too bad it’s for how much its citizens will pay in taxes over their lifetimes.<br />An average New Jersey resident will pay an estimated $931,698 in taxes for his lifetime of toil, according to a new study from the financial technology company Self. That’s nearly twice the $525,037 for the average American. It’s even more than the $734,563 their neighbors in high-tax New York will pay.<br />The study is based on the 2019 Consumer Expenditures Report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and includes taxes on income, property, consumption (sales tax) and owning a car. It reports that New Jersey also ranks No. 1 in taxes as a share of earnings: 49.51% on estimated lifetime earnings of $1,881,648. Oh, yes, the denizens of the Garden State can also expect to pay the most in lifetime property taxes: $378,087.<br />This grim news will not surprise Garden State residents. The high amount of income New Jerseyans fork over to their governments also explains why New Jersey Members of the U.S. House of Representatives signed letters to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer asking that the $10,000 annual cap on the state-and-local tax (SALT) deduction be repealed. Some say they will hold the infrastructure bill hostage if the SALT cap remains.<br />But the more sensible reading of New Jersey’s dismal tax numbers would be to recognize that restoring the SALT deduction is only a Band-Aid—and mainly helps the affluent. Taxes in New Jersey are high for all residents. The real problem is that the state is dominated by public unions that work with politicians to tax, spend and elect, and then do it again.</td>

      <td>A famous Chinese saying is kill the chicken to scare the monkey—that is, make an example of one to scare the many. China is treating Australia like the chicken, and the latest example is hostage Yang Hengjun, who will face trial in China this week on allegations of espionage.<br />In 2018 Australia angered Beijing by banning Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE from its 5G mobile network. Mr. Yang, a writer and Australian citizen, had the bad luck of traveling to China a few months later.<br />In January 2019, authorities detained him on vague charges of endangering national security, although Aussie Foreign Minister Marise Payne said last week that China has “not provided any explanation or evidence for the charges.” He has been in Chinese custody for more than two years, and Ms. Payne said Mr. Yang has had “no access to his family, and limited, delayed access to his legal representation.”<br />China-Australia relations have since worsened. Canberra called last year for an independent probe into the origins of Covid-19, and Beijing responded by slapping tariffs and trade restrictions on a range of Australian commodities. Ms. Payne further infuriated Beijing this spring when she killed two investment agreements between the state of Victoria and the Chinese government.<br />Mr. Yang’s trial is scheduled to begin May 27, and it looks like China will bar Canadian diplomats from attending as observers. Last week Ms. Payne criticized the legal proceedings as “a closed and opaque process to date.” The Chinese embassy responded with a statement demanding that Australia “respect China’s judicial sovereignty and refrain from interfering in any form in Chinese judicial authorities’ lawful handling of the case.”</td>

      <td>Notebooks, sketch pads, talking with others—all help us to improve our thought processes. We make the world our whiteboard—an extra brain lobe.</td>
      <td>In 1998 philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmers published an article titled “The Extended Mind,” in which they wondered, “Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?” Human beings have long relied on technology—print or digital—to remember things and play with ideas. We live and work and learn in crowds—online or off. The self is permeable; no mind is an island. Sure, the brain sits isolated in a skull, but it feeds on interaction with the outside world.<br />Cognitive scientists have since explored the philosophers’ question in several related fields, including embodied, situated and distributed cognition—respectively, how thought is shaped by bodily experience, physical environments and social exchange. In her book “The Extended Mind,” science writer Annie Murphy Paul takes on each in turn. “Our scientific journals mostly proceed from the premise that the mental organ is a disembodied, placeless, asocial entity, a ‘brain in a vat,’ ” she complains at the beginning. “Our history books spin tales that attribute world-changing breakthroughs to individual men, thinking great thoughts on their own.” While this criticism may be overstated, her efforts to upset these interpretations is fascinating, sure-footed and wide-ranging.<br />First, Ms. Paul argues, we pay too little attention to the body. At the ground level, people differ in their interoception, or perception of internal states. Heartbeat awareness sometimes correlates with decision-making ability, as arousal alerts us to danger before we become consciously aware of it. Meditation supposedly increases such abilities. Ms. Paul notes that we might also be made smarter by movement. Exercise or mere walking sharpens perception; for students, participating in recess can improve classwork. We gain a special benefit from gestures. Speakers moving their hands help speakers think and listeners listen. Gesture comes before speech in evolution, child development and even individual utterances.<br />Working her way outward, Ms. Paul argues that the spaces around us expand our minds. Encountering nature can have salutary effects, whether it’s a walk in the woods or looking out an office window. Greenery reduces rumination and anxiety, increases attention and creativity, and lifts one’s mood and physical health, Ms. Paul notes. Built spaces can also be mind-altering, for good or bad. Open offices were meant to help collaboration but typically increase distraction and reduce interaction. Walls increase privacy and some types of creativity. We work best when we can design our own spaces and control when we work solo and work jointly. Then, Ms. Paul notes, there’s the space of ideas. Thinkers benefit from notebooks, sketch pads, architectural models, concept maps and big or multiple computer screens. You can make the world your whiteboard—and in turn an extra brain lobe.<br />Finally, Ms. Paul says, we can merge with other minds. First, by copying experts, or whoever has gone before, and learning from their wisdom and mistakes. Or by sharing one’s expertise: Teachers sometimes learn more than their students, because they are reviewing and organizing material. Second, Ms. Paul notes, we benefit from working with peers. Open-minded debate helps people find flaws in their arguments, and motivates participants to learn more in preparation. We also learn better from peers’ stories and gossip than we do from dry textbooks. Third, thinking as a group lets us tackle projects that simply elude the grasp of one person, such as operating a navy vessel or a particle accelerator. Groups as small as a married couple help members think by delegating memory duties (where are the yard things versus the house things?).</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The State Department warned Americans against all travel to Japan because of the risk posed by the Covid-19 pandemic on Monday, raising its travel advisory for the country to its highest level two months ahead of the Tokyo Olympics.<br />The State Department’s travel advisories are designed to warn travelers about dangers overseas. It now sets Japan at “Level 4: Do Not Travel.” Americans are still permitted to travel to Japan but do so at their own risk.<br />Last month, the State Department warned against travel to about 80% of the world, as countries continued to grapple with surges of the virus while the situation at home improves.<br />The seven-day rolling average of reported U.S. Covid-19 cases has fallen below 30,000 per day and is steadily decreasing, as more of the nation gets vaccinated against the deadly illness. Nationally, more than 39% of people have been fully vaccinated and over 49% have had at least one vaccine dose.<br />By comparison, Japan has only just begun to roll out the large-scale vaccination of its elderly population. Domestically, opposition to the Olympics is growing. Some prominent Japanese business leaders have warned that holding the games could be more damaging to the economy in the long run.</td>

      <td>Homicides have more than doubled in a year. Three children have been shot in the past month.</td>
      <td>Al Sharpton and civil-rights attorney Benjamin Crump led a march in downtown Minneapolis Sunday in advance of the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death on May 25. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of Floyd’s murder last month.<br />Messrs. Sharpton and Crump didn’t visit North Memorial Health Hospital, where two recent victims of a yearlong explosion of violence in Minneapolis are on life support. On April 30 Ladavionne Garrett Jr., 10, was riding in a car with his parents when a gunman opened fire. A bullet pierced Ladavionne’s head; doctors put him in a medically induced coma and removed part of his skull to relieve swelling on the brain. On May 15, 9-year-old Trinity Ottoson-Smith was jumping on a trampoline at a friend’s house when bullets fired from a passing car struck her in the head. She is also in critical condition at North Memorial, in the room next to Ladavionne’s.<br />Nineteen children in Minneapolis have been shot this year, an increase of 171% over the same period in 2020. Their relatives wonder where the protesters are. “Why ain’t nobody mad about a 10-year-old, my grandson, fighting for his life?” asked Sharrie Jennings, Ladavionne’s grandmother, at a May 17 mayoral event. “Because a cop didn’t shoot him, is that why?” Ms. Jennings warned of “a deadly summer” for kids if the mayor and police chief don’t “step up.” Later that day, Aniya Allen, 6, was caught in a shootout between rival gangs while in her mother’s car. Aniya died on May 19.<br />Minneapolis homicides between Jan. 1 and last week were up 108% compared with the same period in 2020; shootings were up 153%, and carjackings 222%. The crime increase began after Floyd’s death and has never let up. Nor has the assault on law enforcement that began with the arson destruction of the Third Precinct building on May 28, 2020. Officers are routinely punched, kicked and hit with projectiles. There was a near-riot in downtown Minneapolis in the early hours of May 22 following a shootout among club patrons. Two people were killed in that shootout and eight wounded. Responding officers called for backup across the Twin Cities at what the department called an “exceptionally chaotic scene.” The previous weekend, officers were maced, and pelted with rocks and debris while trying to disperse disorderly crowds.<br />After Floyd’s death, the Minneapolis City Council called for abolishing the police department and replacing it with a “new transformative model for cultivating safety.” Abolition didn’t happen, but “some folks” in the community got the message anyway that “they have a sort of open season on their enemies,” said Alicia Smith, the executive director of the Corcoran Neighborhood Organization.</td>

      <td>Biden’s secretary defies the Supreme Court’s foundational decision from 1803.</td>
      <td>When Rep. Tom Cole (R., Okla.) asked Education Secretary Miguel Cardona about the department’s proposal to embrace the  New York Times ’s  “1619 Project,” Mr. Cardona replied: “I can assure you that I do want to work with you and others to listen to different perspectives. . . . We have a divided country, but our education system is going to unite us.” But we can attest the department isn’t eager to hear critical voices. Its effort to shut them out defies Marbury v. Madison (1803), the foundational Supreme Court case that recognized the power of judicial review and established the basic principles of the separation of powers.<br />Late in his term, President Trump appointed eight people, including the two of us, to the National Board for Education Sciences. Congress created the NBES in 2002 to advise the Education Department on its research and statistical work. The NBES is mandated to determine whether the department’s “technical and scientific peer review” process is sound, whether its research is “scientifically valid,” and whether its activities “are objective, secular, neutral, and nonideological.” Given this administration’s resurrection of Obama-era departmental guidance and regulations on divisive issues—such as threatening schools with civil-rights investigations based on racial disparities in suspension and expulsion rates—objective research based on sound statistics is more important than ever.<br />But the department is preventing the NBES from evaluating the new policies. Until the new members are seated, the board lacks a quorum and can’t meet. That’s where Marbury v. Madison comes in.<br />Like Marbury, our case starts with a refusal to deliver presidential commissions. White House officials notified us in early January that the president had signed and the secretary of state had processed our commissions. With that, we became federal officers. But the Education Department won’t deliver the commissions or even acknowledge their existence.<br />In 1801 President John Adams signed William Marbury’s commission as a justice of the peace, but Thomas Jefferson became president before Marbury’s commission had been delivered. Jefferson and Secretary of State James Madison refused to recognize Marbury’s appointment and deliver his commission. In a decision written by Chief Justice John Marshall, the high court found that Adams’s signature had made Marbury’s appointment final and that refusal to deliver the commission was “violative of a vested legal right.”</td>

      <td>‘If I were permitted one phone call,” my 18-year old daughter, Molly, recently told me, “and my life depended on that person picking up, I’d call you.” How nice, I thought, but she wasn’t finished: “Not mom.” Ouch.<br />Sure, I tend to pick up more often than Devin, my wife, does, especially when it’s family calling. But unlike my daughter, I don’t assume I’m being screened whenever my call goes directly to voice mail. In fact, I don’t mind at all.<br />I can’t blame Molly, or any other digital native who grew up with the instant-gratification expectations that smartphones engender. These cherubic callers simply have never experienced frontier justice as administered by the busy signal.<br />For them, the options have always been a successful conversation or a shot at voice mail. By contrast, most peak-hour calls made in my 1980s adolescence resulted in the dreaded busy signal, telephony’s equivalent of being told “Ask Again Later” by the then-popular Magic 8-Ball.<br />The busy signal wouldn’t have put you through to voice mail even if the technology had existed. The busy signal didn’t care if you were the queen of England. The busy signal told you someone had beaten you to the punch, plain and simple. The busy signal was bigger than you.</td>

      <td>He’s not chief justice, but never before has he had the power and influence he has now.</td>
      <td>For Clarence Thomas, any chance he might become chief justice has long since passed. But at 72, he is coming into his own. For circumstances have now made it as plausible to speak of the Thomas court as the Roberts court.<br />The trigger was the replacement of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Justice Amy Coney Barrett. This move gave conservatives a 6-3 majority, depriving Chief Justice John Roberts of the ability to swing decisions to the liberal side—unless he manages to bring Brett Kavanaugh along undefinedwith him.<br />This gives Justice Kavanaugh Joe Manchin-like powers over any case in which the chief might go south on his more conservative-minded colleagues. It’s a big change from the days when Justice Anthony Kennedy could easily move back and forth, here siding with conservatives to strike down speech limits in Citizens United v. FEC (2010), and there unearthing in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) a constitutional right for gay couples to marry.<br />For a while, Chief Justice Roberts looked as though he might become the new Anthony Kennedy. The chief pulled his own Kennedy in 2012, even before Justice Kennedy retired, when he saved ObamaCare by ruling that the individual mandate was a tax and thus constitutional. He has sided with the court’s liberal wing on other cases too, such as when he blocked the Trump administration’s bid to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. At the same time, the Roberts court has lately been shy to take up contentious issues from abortion to gun rights.<br />Enter Clarence Thomas. As Jan Crawford Greenburg noted in her 2007 book, “Supreme Conflict,” for many years Justice Thomas has been dismissed unfairly as Antonin Scalia’s sidekick. In fact, the men weren’t only brothers-in-arms but brothers—just listen to Justice Thomas’s tremendous eulogy for Scalia—whose significant disagreements on issues from natural law to deference to precedent helped each hone his own position while increasing their mutual respect.</td>

      <td>The Gaza war spilled into America last week as some pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas demonstrators crossed the line separating protest from mob violence in several U.S. cities.<br />Past anti-Jewish violence in America has generally come in one of three forms. It has either been perpetrated by a deranged individual like in the 2018 shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, by an outgrowth of communal tensions as in the 1991 Crown Heights riots, or by an attack on a particular Jewish individual such as the 1915 lynching of Leo Frank.<br />Last week brought something different: Mobs visited widespread violence on random Jews, or in some cases “Jewish-looking” non-Jews. The targets have no responsibility for Israeli policy. Given the policy preferences of U.S. Jews documented in polling, many were likely anti-Trump, anti-Netanyahu, critical of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and pro-Black Lives Matter. None of this meant anything to the mob. All the attackers seemed to care about was that their victims were, or looked, Jewish. That was enough.<br />Nothing about last week’s violence would have surprised Theodor Herzl, architect of the Zionist movement. The core insight that drove Herzl into Zionism was that though the ideals of the liberal enlightenment were beautiful and appealing, European Jews would perish horribly if they entrusted their fate to them. Many Israelis—whether descended from Holocaust survivors, Jews expelled or fleeing persecution and discrimination across the Middle East, or Jews who endured oppression and discrimination in the Soviet Union—believe from familial and personal experience that Herzl got it right.<br />Americans have tried to build a country that could prove Herzl wrong. The U.S. has sought to form a national identity that transcends race and tribe, in which anyone—including Jewish Americans and Palestinian-Americans—can be truly at home and as American as apple pie. The country isn’t there yet, but many of us want to keep trying.</td>

      <td>Promising and amazing advances in vaccination, diagnostic tests, immune therapy and gene testing.</td>
      <td>Fifty years have passed since President Nixon declared war on cancer in his 1971 State of the Union address: “The time has come in America when the same kind of concentrated effort that . . . took man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this dread disease.” Today we are closer than ever to that goal.<br />Cancer killed 10 million people world-wide last year, and doctors diagnosed 19 million new cases. Yet scientists have made startling progress in understanding, preventing and treating it. “I’ve had an oncologist tell me that this is a very exciting time to have cancer,” a medical journalist quipped this month at the Fifth International Vatican Conference, an annual gathering of medical, scientific and religious experts. Panelists described progress on many fronts in the battle against cancer:<br />• New vaccines against human papillomavirus, which causes cervical and throat cancer, are in late-stage trials. Scientists are also testing vaccines for melanoma, leukemia, lung and renal cancers.<br />• In five years there may be a simple blood test costing less than $500 that can detect 70% of all cancers in the earliest stages. When patients with breast, prostate and thyroid cancer spot the disease early, their five-year survival rate is 99%.<br />• New Crispr gene-editing technology deploys a molecular defense system borrowed from bacteria, which use this system to kill invading viral cells by unzippering their DNA to rip it apart. Scientists are using Crispr to repair or rewrite flawed genes. The therapy cured sickle-cell anemia in the first three patients to receive it, and soon it will take on cancer. Many trials of Crispr therapies in the U.S. now are in phase 2 for leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma and more. In China, Crispr is showing promise against lung cancer.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The National Guard, deployed to secure the U.S. Capitol in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack by a pro-Trump mob, will end its mission there Wednesday, the Pentagon said.<br />The troops began arriving at the Capitol hours after Trump supporters breached the Capitol building while Congress was certifying the election of President Biden. The number of troops at one point peaked at 26,000, representing all 50 states, three territories and the District of Columbia. Their strength has been gradually reduced, and roughly 1,600 members remain at the complex, where the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives meet and have office space.<br />The Pentagon hasn’t provided an updated cost estimate since March, when it said it had spent $521 million. Although the soldiers are leaving, officials have warned that the hardened security measures around the Capitol would remain.<br />“They will not be able to return immediately to the open campus where people can openly visit the Capitol because of the strain on the Capitol Police,” said Ret. Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who conducted a security review following the riots, Sunday on CBS.<br />The Capitol Police twice requested the National Guard to extend its mission around the Capitol. The force asked the Guard to stay past March 4, for instance, the date of the presidential inauguration day until the 1930s. Law-enforcement officials feared another mob could gather and attack the Capitol on that date.</td>

He warned of “mayhem” if Apple’s review process isn’t required.<br />U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers will rule in the coming months on Epic’s claim that Apple has improperly prohibited third-party app stores on the iPhone and required app developers to use its in-app payment system that takes a commission of as much as 30%.<br />Apple has denied it is a monopoly, pointing to other ways Epic’s game “Fortnite” can be distributed. The company has said its rules around the app store ensure the safety and reliability of apps for users. Apple has argued its fees are similar to others and that Epic is merely trying to get out of paying its fair share.</td>

      <td>Six weeks ago, it seemed as if hedge fund boss Heath Freeman was losing his grip on  Tribune Publishing Co.  But he never let go—and now he has his prize.<br />Mr. Freeman, the president of Alden Global Capital LLC, is poised to become the leader of the second-largest U.S. newspaper company, following the firm’s takeover of Tribune. Shareholders voted Friday to approve a sale to Alden, which previously had a roughly 32% stake in the company.<br />Alden, a specialist in distressed assets, has focused on the newspaper business in recent years, and the 41-year-old Mr. Freeman is the low-profile firm’s most public face. The Tribune deal adds properties like the Chicago Tribune and New York Daily News to Alden’s portfolio, which includes MediaNews Group, a chain of 70-odd dailies such as the Denver Post and San Jose Mercury News.<br />Mr. Freeman, who co-founded Alden in 2007 as a 26-year-old alongside his mentor, investor Randall Smith, has pushed a strategy of consolidation and cost reductions at the group’s papers. As a major Tribune shareholder, Alden backed cuts last year at the company—amid a steep, pandemic-driven advertising downturn—that slashed a third of the total payroll and closed about half its news offices, with no stated plans to open new ones.<br />Journalists and media watchdogs say such cuts have gutted local outlets and hastened the industry’s demise. Mr. Freeman has said he’s saving newspapers by keeping them financially viable.</td>

In an interview, he said he has been preparing for the voluntary meeting with the French investigators through hourslong sessions with his lawyers.<br />“I’ve been looking forward to it,” he said from an antique armchair in a boutique hotel here. “I would have liked them to come much earlier.”<br />As the center of gravity of Mr. Ghosn’s legal jeopardy moves from Japan to France, the 67-year-old denies wrongdoing in both venues. He also says he doesn’t regret the year and a half he has spent stuck in his boyhood home of Lebanon. Apart from working on his legal defenses, Mr. Ghosn spends one day a week organizing a business course at a local university. He goes on hikes with friends in the mountains around Beirut, and he plays online bridge.<br />Mr. Ghosn has long said he fled Japan because he didn’t think he could get a fair trial there after his 2018 arrest. He now says he is no longer sure he would get a fair hearing in France, either. French authorities have seized millions of dollars worth of assets held by Mr. Ghosn and his wife amid the probe.</td>

      <td>The introspective album from the teenage singer-songwriter proves that she’s no one-hit wonder.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />Olivia Rodrigo is a little under five months into her solo recording career and she’s already made history. On Jan. 8, she released her debut single, “Drivers License,” a moody ballad about lost love, and it was an instant sensation. It immediately leaped to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for eight weeks—one of only a handful of times an artist’s first single has topped the chart, and the first time one has lasted so long in the pole position. Ms. Rodrigo, who was 17 years old when “Drivers License” came out and turned 18 in February, was already famous to young audiences as an actress in “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” on Disney+. She’d recorded as part of the cast and appeared on the show’s soundtrack album. But her existing celebrity can’t fully account for the runaway success of “Drivers License.” On Spotify, the track is closing in on 800 million streams, an absurdly high number for a song that hasn’t been out for half a year.<br />“Sour” (Geffen/Interscope), Ms. Rodrigo’s debut LP, out now, offers a more complete picture of an artist we’ll be hearing from for a long time. In interviews the singer has characterized herself as a musical omnivore, but the artistic lineage of her own work is well-defined. The songs are mostly ballads, the subject is fleeting romance and the emotional crush of the breakup, and the hushed style is built on intimacy. One of Ms. Rodrigo’s heroes is Taylor Swift, and the influence is obvious even though their music sounds very different. The fourth track here, “1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back,” borrows elements from a composition by Ms. Swift, who with her frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff gets a credit. Vocally, Ms. Rodrigo is indebted to the vowel-mangling indie-pop diction popularized by Australian singer Lorde and the whispered closeness of Billie Eilish.</td>

      <td>ON MAY 2, when Jenny Chen and Kenny Song got married beside a lily pad-dotted pond at a Napa Valley vineyard, the event certainly honored the adage “something old, something new.” Forty-four guests hobnobbed in real life at cocktail hour, but all were vaccinated or just-tested. And when signing the marriage license, the couple, both resident physicians, broadcast the act to folks as far away as Taiwan from the venue’s WiFi-enabled wine cave.<br />Ms. Chen and Mr. Song’s virtual guests watched the stream by pulling up the couple’s page on the wedding-planning site Zola, the same site they’d used to access the gift registry and invitations. Welcome to the summer of the hybrid wedding—a blending of traditional nuptials with high-tech strategies perfected for remote events during the pandemic.<br />When Covid-19 handed the wedding industry lemons, it made lemon-drop martinis, and fast—finding ways to let couples choose tasty cakes, scrutinize dresses and welcome guests remotely. Now, as we move past the days of Zoom-only nuptials, wedding planners say many of these convenient and efficient virtual strategies remain popular with their clients.<br />“After this, there is no going back to how we used to do it,” said Jung Lee, an event planner and founder of virtual wedding registry site Slowdance. In fact, 90% of its interactions with clients now start online, she added, up from only 30% pre-pandemic. “From a time efficiency standpoint, it really works,” she said. In a recent survey, Zola found that 49% of wedding vendors believe wedding streaming to faraway guests will continue through 2022 and beyond.<br />Engaged couples are also enjoying more freedom when it comes to expressing a desire for non-toaster gifts. Rather than signing up only at Bloomingdale’s, they are increasingly opting for flexible online registries that let them specify items from any retailer that has a webpage. At Zola and the Knot, guests have the option of donating GoFundMe-style to the honeymoon or a down payment on a home.</td>

      <td>It’s the oldest hatred, but its resurgence signals a wider disturbance in society’s soul.</td>
      <td>There’s something especially unsettling about the newest eruption of the oldest hatred. Anti-Semitism has been so routine and enduring a part of human history that it’s easy to become almost numb to fresh instances of it.<br />For a statistical picture of how consistent—and contemporary—Jew-hatred is, look at the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s hate-crime data. We live in an age of heightened awareness of ethnic and racial victimhood, but in the quarter-century the bureau has kept records, hate crimes against blacks have declined dramatically—by more than a third between 1996 and 2019, the latest year of full data. By contrast, the number of anti-Semitic crimes—which are, proportionate to the share of Jews in the population, much more frequent than antiblack crime—has scarcely changed.<br />Jews themselves know better than anyone that, as banal as this ancient evil is, outbreaks of anti-Semitism can be a harbinger of something more pervasive, a signal of a wider disturbance in a society’s soul. That’s the inescapable sense one gets from the recent rash of assaults that have unfolded in New York, Los Angeles, Florida and elsewhere.<br />The political context is new, for a start. In the past most of the anti-Semitic attacks in the U.S. have been the product of the usual depraved minds: white supremacists or sick individuals deciding to take out their pathologies on the group most often blamed for society’s flaws.<br />Occasionally there’s been a broader political subplot. Outbursts of anti-Semitic violence occurred at times with the encouragement of black leaders such as Louis Farrakhan or the now supposedly respectable Al Sharpton. But mostly they haven’t occurred as the kind of street-level response to geopolitical events that is too common among political activists in Europe, especially on the left.</td>

The yearslong surge in remakes and spinoffs is set to hit new heights this fall, after networks unveiled their prime-time schedules to advertisers last week.<br />Reboots “are a safer bet but, on the negative side, it shows the networks aren’t taking any risks,” said Garth Tiedje, executive vice president of video investment for Horizon Media.<br />While that trend hasn’t dazzled Madison Avenue, which will decide in coming weeks how much to gamble on the next wave of predictable programming, broadcast networks are expected to benefit from an uptick in TV ad spending.<br />After years of ratings erosion, the networks took an especially big hit during the pandemic, with all of them down double-digit percentages in total viewers in 2020 from the previous year and most taking similar hits in viewership among key demographics.</td>

He wrapped himself in a foil survival blanket he was carrying, pressed the SOS button on his GPS locator, and then blacked out.<br />When Mr. Zhang returned to consciousness, hours later, he found that he had been rescued by a local sheep herder, who had brought him to a cave stocked with quilts and firewood. Mr. Zhang didn’t answer messages to his accounts or calls to his phone. The Wall Street Journal confirmed the authenticity of Mr. Zhang’s account with a colleague.<br />Many of Mr. Zhang’s fellow racers weren’t so lucky. By the time rescue operations had concluded on Sunday, 21 athletes—including some of China’s top trail runners—had died from exposure, in an incident that is sparking anger and consternation throughout the country.<br />On Monday, mountain-trail races were being canceled throughout China, people involved in the races said. Those moves followed an emergency meeting of Chinese sports officials Sunday night that called on local governments to monitor safety risks, and the launch of an investigation into Saturday’s race by the government in Gansu, the province where it took place.</td>

      <td>What can you learn from the heart-rate metrics on your fitness tracker?<br /><br />The bottom line<br /><br />You may use your fitness tracker mostly to count steps, but don’t ignore your heart-rate metrics—they can tell you a lot about your health. Devices now deliver a variety of heart-rate measurements, including resting rate, walking rate and variability (the variation of time between beats). Some can be programmed to notify you of a possible problem, such as a heart rate that is unusually high, low or irregular. Without getting fancy, however, your basic heart rate alone can be revealing.</td>

      <td>In “California Leftists Try to Cancel Math Class” (op-ed, May 19), Williamson M. Evers correctly quotes some of the antiracist dogmas being promoted that will frustrate math learning. However, many of the improvements recommended for classroom instruction (i.e., teaching math in the context of practical problem solving for life, paying attention to students’ learning modes, using common sense about prerequisites, etc.) have been known for decades and been used and promoted by teachers who are skilled in math education. The best teachers already use those techniques and are successful with them, independent of what color their students’ skin is.<br />The known, good curriculum improvements have nothing to do with racism; associating them with racism isn’t going to help students with math so much as pit students against each other in yet another domain of human productivity.<br />Andrew Griffis<br />Tucson, Ariz.<br /></td>

      <td>Renewable energy lobby says wind projects are driving investment and creating new opportunities.</td>
      <td>Re Robert Bryce’s “Rural America Gets Bad Vibrations from Big Wind” (op-ed, May 6): The reality is that wind projects are driving unmatched investment and creating new opportunities in rural America in ways that improve real lives.<br />Wind projects pay over $1.6 billion in local and state taxes every year—new revenue communities invest in schools, roads and emergency services. They also create new jobs that let young people stay and grow in their communities so they don’t face the awful choice of leaving home to find work to support a family. 120,000 Americans across all 50 states have direct wind jobs.<br />Wind projects also protect the character of agricultural communities. Farmers grow crops and ranchers graze cattle right up to the base of a wind turbine, and a typical wind project leaves 98% of land undisturbed. The lease payments to farmers and ranchers for hosting wind turbines also provide steady income to keep the family farm in the family.<br />Mr. Bryce claims communities are rejecting wind, but communities disagree. That’s why wind has grown exponentially over the past decade. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory surveyed wind-farm neighbors and found 92% of people reported positive or neutral experiences.<br />Heather Zichal</td>

In any case these converts were, in the end, viewed as suspect by many of their adopted faith.<br />As Diane Cole writes in her review of James McAuley’s “The House of Fragile Things” (Books, May 8), wealthy Jews often attempted to gain acceptance to society through assimilation but, “despite their riches, all their efforts proved of little or no avail.”<br />John Gross, a former editor of the Times Literary Supplement, concisely summed up the predicament: “To be Jewish is to belong to a club from which no one is allowed to resign.”<br />Ira Sohn<br />New York</td>

      <td>Julien’s, an auction house in Beverly Hills, Calif., has had a megasuccessful year selling preworn celebrity clothing—thanks in large part to nostalgia-obsessed millennials</td>
      <td>IN 2015, Julien’s Auctions in Beverly Hills, Calif., sold the fuzzy green mohair-blend sweater that Kurt Cobain wore on Nirvana’s “MTV Unplugged” episode for $140,800. Four years later, the stained cardigan was back on the auction block again. That time it went for $334,000. Today, Darren Julien, the owner of Julien’s, an 18-year-old auction house that frequently hosts sales of celebrity possessions, believes the same grungy sweater could perhaps fetch double that amount. “I’ve had offers of $500,000 to $700,000 to get the buyer to sell it,” he said. For now, the anonymous owner is keeping Cobain’s cardigan. But no matter for Mr. Julien: He has plenty of highly covetable celebrity clothes filling up his auction calendar.<br />Other auction houses including Heritage and Sotheby’s dabble in pop culture items, but Julien’s is the rare firm which trades almost entirely in nostalgic, celebrity-owned relics. It “specializes in things people don’t need, but things that they want,” said Mr. Julien, including tour-used guitars, furniture from star’s homes and lots and lots of famous clothes. He founded his business four years after financier Martin Zweig paid $1.26 million in a landmark 1999 Christie’s sale to acquire the slinky dress Marilyn Monroe wore to sing “Happy Birthday” to John F. Kennedy. In 2016, Julien’s sold that same beaded, flesh-colored gown on behalf of Mr. Zweig’s widow for $4.8 million.<br />For Julien’s, the business of auctioning off pop-culturally significant clothes—steady through the mid-2010s—has erupted in the past few years thanks to deep-pocketed 20- to 40-somethings. “Rich millennials don’t want Picasso and Monet. They want pop culture,” said Mr. Julien. “That’s what connects them or, you know, is most appealing to them.”<br />In January, a set of seven outfits worn by the K-pop band BTS in its 2020 “Dynamite” video sold for $162,500, far exceeding the lot’s $40,000 high estimate. The set was purchased collectively by a pair of Japanese bidders: Yusaku Maezawa, 45, a billionaire and art collector and Hikakin, a 32-year-old YouTuber. A video of the duo joyously winning the auction posted to Mr. Maezawa’s account has been viewed more than three million times.<br />In April, a pair of Air Jordan sneakers that Bill Murray wore in the 1996 film “Space Jam,” a millennial favorite, brought in $22,400 on a $7,000 high estimate. And just two weekends ago, coinciding with Janet Jackson’s birthday, Julien’s hosted a three-day auction of her belongings, including some of the singer’s seminal early-MTV-era outfits. Julien’s does not disclose buyers’ identities without permission, but a few bidders boasted about their purchases on social media.</td>

Then they surrounded him. By the time cops and PGA Championship officials had barreled through rows and rows of people to create a narrow pathway for the 50-year-old champion to squeeze through, the scene was already an unforgettable snapshot of a triumphant moment: Sports are back because sports fans are back.<br />“Considering where we are in the world right now, it was sort of weird,” said Tim Mickelson, Phil’s brother and caddie. “But it was also pretty darned cool to see.”<br />The last year has seen Tom Brady win the Super Bowl, LeBron James win the NBA championship and the Los Angeles Dodgers win the World Series. Naomi Osaka won the U.S. Open, and Rafael Nadal won the French Open. Nick Saban and Alabama won another college football national championship, and Sue Bird and the Seattle Storm won another WNBA title.

      <td>New treatment using optogenetics has restored limited vision to people blinded by hereditary retinal disease</td>
      <td>Scientists are making dramatic strides toward a goal that once seemed almost unimaginable: Restoring limited vision to people affected by a previously irreversible form of blindness caused by an inherited eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa.<br />In a paper published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers working with the Paris-based company GenSight Biologics SA reported that a 58-year-old man who was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa 40 years ago was able to locate objects placed on a table after receiving an experimental therapy. And New York City-based company Bionic Sight LLC announced in March that four blind people in an early-stage clinical trial are now able to detect light and motion after undergoing a similar treatment. Those results haven’t yet been published.<br />The patients all had advanced cases of retinitis pigmentosa, which affects more than two million people world-wide. All underwent optogenetic therapy, in which an injection is used to deliver a gene into the eye to boost the light sensitivity of certain cells in the retina, a layer of tissue at the back of the eye. The companies are developing high-tech goggles that process and amplify light in a way that boosts the cells’ ability to send electrical signals to the brain.<br />Dr. Anand Swaroop, a senior investigator at the National Eye Institute in Bethesda, Md., called optogenetic therapy an exciting option for some blind people but not a cure. Once sight is lost completely, he said, “Restoring vision that allows high resolution, high sensitivity, and high detection is not simple.”<br />Barry Honig, a participant in the Bionic Sight trial, said that people had often asked him if he would like to be able to see again. “This is the first time I have felt it is attainable,” he said.</td>

The tensions have been exacerbated by the worst violence in decades between Israel’s Jews and its two million Arab citizens, about a fifth of its population, over the Israel-Hamas conflict.<br />Over the past two weeks, Israeli police have arrested more than 1,500 people suspected of taking part in the disturbances, indicting about 150 suspects, it said Monday. The weeklong operation—dubbed Law and Order—will include thousands of police officers and border troops, including reservists, the police said.</td>

That rule is worth pondering as the Senate this week considers whether to approve creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate the ransacking of the Capitol by an angry mob of Trump supporters on Jan. 6.<br />The main question that will be debated is: What will happen if such a panel is created?<br />The better question may be: What will happen if one isn’t?<br />For starters, there will be plenty of inquiries into the events of Jan. 6 anyway. Dozens of trials of those who entered the Capitol will unfold, producing a lot of new information and detail. Congressional committees, operating in a typically partisan fashion, will continue to call witnesses, hold public hearings and issue reports. Journalistic inquiries will continue.<br />But here’s one other consequence if Washington chooses to move down the road without such a commission: The political system will have shown that it remains incapable of reversing the very problems that produced the violence in the first place—severe partisanship, rampant mistrust of the other side, a new willingness to question election results.</td>

But analysts say it has lagged behind the U.S. in addressing complaints, in part because legislative oversight of the military is among the weakest relative to other major Western democracies.<br />The most high-profile allegation involves Canada’s recently retired top soldier, Gen. Jonathan Vance, and claims that he engaged in a sexual relationship with a female subordinate over a number of years, and made a sexual comment toward a junior officer some time in early 2018. Both have been the subject of a military-police investigation and a parliamentary inquiry since February.<br />Approached outside his home in Ottawa earlier this month, Gen. Vance declined to comment on either of the allegations, which had been reported by Canada’s Global Television Network in February.</td>

Investor demand is starting to rebound, especially for well-leased properties in strong locations.<br />The SoHo buildings, which include 180,000 square feet of office space and 60,000 square feet of retail space, are more than 90%-occupied by tenants such as the Balthazar restaurant and the Aritzia women’s fashion boutique. Office tenants include WeWork, a commercial real-estate company that provides shared workspaces.<br />Shiva Viswanathan, a Northwood senior managing director, declined to comment on details of the deal.

Balthazar and other restaurants that had been closed for much of the pandemic have reopened, according to Mark Dicus, head of the SoHo Broadway Initiative, a business-improvement district.</td>

      <td>China’s efforts to restrain cryptocurrency trading and mining are adding to the wild moves in bitcoin and other markets.<br />Already down hard from records set this year, bitcoin and other digital currencies sold off sharply last week after Chinese authorities renewed pressure on the country’s banks and payment companies to curb cryptocurrency-related transactions. Markets stumbled again after a powerful superregulator chaired by Vice Premier Liu He pledged to crack down on bitcoin mining and trading. The price of bitcoin fell below $32,000 early Monday, down from over $44,000 a week earlier.<br />China is trying to rein in cryptocurrency activities even as the country has embraced the technology underlying bitcoin and has plans to roll out its own digital yuan that will be controlled by its central bank. Beijing also wants to shut down cryptocurrency-mining activities because they consume massive amounts of electricity, often from coal-fired power plants, while the country pledged to manage its carbon emissions.<br />“The Chinese government does not like the highly volatile, speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market,” said Fan Long, a co-founder of Conflux, a government-backed public blockchain network in China. He said the authorities could take further action to restrict or eliminate ways for Chinese citizens to exchange yuan into cryptocurrencies in the over-the-counter market.<br />On Sunday, Huobi, a major cryptocurrency exchange, said it would stop selling mining machines and related services to new users in mainland China. It will also suspend futures contracts, exchange-traded products and leveraged investment products to new users in a few countries and regions. OKEx, another popular digital-currency exchange, on Monday said its own token, OKB, can no longer be traded with the Chinese yuan.</td>

Italy’s banking sector, stuffed with soured loans and weighed down by high costs, has long loomed as the weakest link among countries that share the euro currency.<br />Last week Mr. Draghi’s government simplified procedures for banks to benefit from tax breaks when they merge, effectively giving them more time to access these benefits.<br />The move is raising expectations among Italian bank executives for mergers to come.

      <td>Wanda’s AMC acquisition has finally paid off. That mostly comes down to luck though—the deal still looks mostly like a cautionary tale.</td>
      <td>Dalian Wanda Group’s Hollywood adventure has finally come to a satisfying close—thanks to one last crazy twist.<br />The Chinese real-estate conglomerate has sold almost all of its remaining stake in U.S. cinema giant  AMC Entertainment ,  according to a regulatory filing Friday. Wanda’s two representatives will also resign from the theater chain’s board of directors.<br />But Wanda probably won’t shed a tear for the end of the nine-year relationship. The company made a surprise killing after AMC’s share price rallied this year, fueled by the meme stock phenomenon, where frenzied online traders pushed up the share prices of small caps—most notoriously game retailer  GameStop .  AMC has surged 470% in 2021 after the company found itself on the brink of bankruptcy last year due to the pandemic. The company had a market value of $5.4 billion Friday, but it was worth only about $200 million in April of last year, mostly because it managed to raise money through issuing new shares at the higher prices. Wanda spent $700 million to buy AMC in 2012 and the company said it has doubled its money. Wanda started selling AMC shares in December and has accelerated those sales this year as the Reddit-fueled frenzy continued to drive debt-laden AMC’s share price higher.<br />Yet Wanda’s Hollywood adventure wasn’t the blockbuster it had hoped for. Under Wanda’s management, AMC became the world’s largest movie chain after buying rival Carmike and U.K.-based Odeon. Wanda also bought Legendary Entertainment, the film studio behind movies like “Godzilla vs. Kong” and “The Dark Knight,” for $3.5 billion in 2016. Its chairman Wang Jianlin, once China’s richest man, has previously expressed interest in buying one of the major Hollywood studios.<br />That Hollywood dream shattered when Beijing cracked down on the country’s acquisitive and overly leveraged companies, which made billions of dollars of deals abroad in the early 2010s, as part of a broader official campaign against capital outflows and heavy leverage. HNA Group and Anbang Insurance ran into similar trouble. As part of its move to pare down debts, Wanda sold nearly $10 billion of theme park and hotel assets to two other Chinese developers in 2017.</td>

      <td>Investors hunting for signs of inflation pressure should keep an eye on something they might not usually think about: the cost of insuring a car or home.<br />Last year insurers were often lowering premiums for auto customers who were driving a lot less and therefore getting into fewer accidents. Now, as life in the U.S. begins to return to normal, consumers’ motor-vehicle insurance costs are again rising. The recent U.S. consumer-price index update had that component up 6.1% in April from a year earlier, ending a long string of decreases and jumping the most since 2018.<br />The question for insurers is whether premium increases will be big enough. Part of the cost of covering a claim to repair or replace a car or home is under pressure. Factors include the global chip shortage, the scarcity of rental cars and the increased price of lumber and other building materials. The consumer-price-index measure of vehicle-repair costs has been on the rise.<br />At the same time, it is unclear how quickly people will return to their old driving habits and what that will do to accident frequency. Perhaps they still aren’t driving to work as often. But are they taking a lot more road trips?<br />Progressive  said earlier this month it was monitoring such things as the pace of people returning to the office, lumber prices and the chip shortage. The company’s April underlying ratio of accident-year, noncatastrophe loss and loss-adjustment expense to net earned premium was about 70%, higher than about 67% during the prior month.</td>

      <td>The chances that bitcoin will ever become real money or make a productive contribution to society seem close to nil. Then again, the same is true for so many things in life.<br />On Monday, the price of bitcoin found some footing after a turbulent weekend, rising to almost $37,000—still a painful 37% drop from the start of the month. Investors are engaged in the rational but onerous task of figuring out whether virtual currencies are immensely valuable because they can threaten governments’ fiat money, or just worthless digital tokens.<br />Lately, their price has seemed to fluctuate at the whim of a single man: prominent crypto cheerleader and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk. This month, he said his company will no longer accept bitcoin as payment for electric cars, allegedly because of the emissions generated by computers verifying transactions and “mining” tokens. One estimate puts bitcoin’s massive carbon footprint on a par with Portugal’s.<br />There is probably another reason. While Tesla has pledged not to sell its stash of bitcoins, getting paid in a noncash volatile asset poses accounting problems for any company.<br />Ultimately, cryptocurrencies have no convincing use case.

      <td>Bank of America Corp.’s  Merrill Lynch Wealth Management unit is banning trainee brokers from making cold calls, a vestige of an era when the industry pushed hot stocks on anyone who would pick up the phone.<br />Merrill plans to roll out a revamped adviser-training program on Monday that prohibits participants from cold calling, people familiar with the matter said. The bank will instead direct them to use internal referrals or LinkedIn messages to land clients, they said. The decision comes after the program’s 3,000 trainees were told to stop outbound recruiting efforts to find new customers last year after problematic phone calls.<br />The announcement will formalize a shift that executives have signaled for months. “We are leaning much more heavily on leads and referrals from the broader company,” Merrill President Andy Sieg said in April. “There is also an opportunity to be much more modern in terms of the way we are reaching out to prospective clients.”<br />Merrill’s training program, first established in 1945, was meant to be the firm’s pipeline for new advisers after it cut back on the expensive practice of poaching from other firms. The pool of candidates that starts off in the program, which pays a base salary of $65,000 a year, is typically young and diverse. Participants who fail to meet the goals are kicked out or moved to other roles in the bank.<br />In recent years, only a small portion of trainees completed the program. Successful recruits often had extensive personal networks and were less reliant on cold calling, trainees said.</td>

      <td>Sales of securities backed by bundles of risky corporate loans are hitting records, lifted by a recovering economy and demand from yield-starved investors.<br />Issuance of new collateralized loan obligations, which buy up loans to companies with junk credit ratings and package them into securities, totaled over $59 billion as of May 20, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence’s’ LCD. That is the highest ever figure for that period in data going back to 2005.<br />The prospect of rising inflation and a shift away from the Federal Reserve’s easy money policies are making bonds tied to so-called CLOs attractive to a wider range of investors, analysts said. Many are expecting strong growth to prompt Fed tightening, eroding returns on corporate bonds. Yields on CLO bonds typically rise with interest rates.<br />The CLO market’s record sales pace marks a reversal from this time last year, when pandemic fears caused debt prices to plummet, freezing sales of new funds. Support from the Fed, including cutting interest rates to near zero and buying the highest-quality bonds from certain types of CLOs, has since helped bring investors back.<br />CLOs have become a $760 billion market, accounting for 70% of new leveraged loan purchases last year, according to Citi. Because CLOs’ loan holdings are diversified, the bonds can achieve higher credit ratings than the underlying loans, making them popular among institutions restricted to investment-grade debt, such as banks and insurers.</td>

While the percentage of poll respondents who said he should resign increased, the share of voters who said they were prepared to re-elect him rose to 37%, from 33% in April.

      <td>The U.S. Treasury Department wants a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, a reduced ask from the 21% level it previously suggested. If the policy ever came to pass, that could still have a marked impact on international markets.<br />On a headline basis, the 15% tax would move several countries not typically considered tax havens—Thailand, the U.K. and Vietnam for example—onto the safe side of the line.<br />In both Hong Kong and Singapore, headline corporate tax rates sit between 15% and 21%. But in reality, as noted by Asia economists at Citi, their effective tax rates are made considerably lower by various breaks and incentives and a 15% level would likely still cause issues. Ireland and Macau, with corporate tax rates at 12.5% and 12% respectively, would both be caught even without considering any breaks or incentives.<br />A number of major American companies make more than 50% of their income internationally, and have both foreign effective tax rates and consensus 2022 effective tax rates below 15%, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs. That list includes  NVIDIA Corp. ,  Broadcom Inc.,   Las Vegas Sands Corp.  and  Microchip Technology Inc.  The analysts see fewer impacts in Europe, where the vast majority of companies already pay above 21% as it is.<br />Paradoxically, the lower the minimum proposed, the greater the threat to the most obvious havens like Jersey, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands. Since those territories have 0% corporation tax rates, they will be hit under an agreement on any level and a lower proposal is more likely to garner broad international support.</td>

Managers will be left to deal with the aftermath. If one of your reports approaches you with a rival offer, or news they’re on the way out, do you fight to keep them? And what might persuade them to stay?<br />Many workers spent 2020 feeling frozen in place. With everything from child care to health tainted by uncertainty, it seemed prudent to stay put if you were lucky enough to have a stable job.<br />“Most people have just tolerated things that aren’t perfect,” Ravi Raman, an executive coach in Minneapolis, says of his clients. “There’s a lot of pressure getting built up in the system.”<br />Employees are now ready to leave behind the usual culprits: bad bosses, untenable workloads, skimpy paychecks. But managers also must contend with new desires and priorities sparked by the pandemic. In the Prudential survey, 42% percent of workers currently working remotely said if their employer didn’t make the option permanent, they’d find one that did.</td>

They completely enveloped Mickelson before he could even make it to the green, while Brooks Koepka, his final round pairing, had to fight through the crowd to join him.

      <td>A Republican senator sent letters to three regional Federal Reserve bank leaders on Sunday seeking information about their recent work on racial economic equality, which he said he views as politicized activity that stands at odds with the central bank’s mandate.<br />Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) wrote to the leaders of the Atlanta, Boston and Minneapolis Federal Reserve banks. The latest letters follow one sent in March to the San Francisco Fed on its climate change and social focus, which he also deemed at odds with the central bank’s mission.<br />Much like the San Francisco letter, the senator wrote to the three banks on their work on what he called “politically charged social causes,” which he deemed as “wholly unrelated to the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.”<br />Mr. Toomey, the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, told the banks that some of their recent work on race issues suffered from severe bias and added, “All of the policy prescriptions recommended to treat the presumed ubiquity of racism required a more intrusive and expansive government.”<br />Two of the three banks receiving letters from the senator have nonwhite leaders, a rarity at a central bank whose top ranks over the years largely have been populated by white men.</td>

Matthew Popper, previously a managing director in Goldman’s merchant bank, will oversee investments in financial and information services. And Vignesh Aier, formerly at private-equity firm New Mountain Capital, will run healthcare investing.<br />Mr. Rajpal has also recruited four operating executives with specialties in digital transformation, artificial intelligence, data analytics and human capital. Unlike at most buyout shops where operational specialists are often brought in to evaluate strategy and improve companies after they have been acquired, these executives will sit on GrowthCurve’s investment committee and evaluate deals when they are first proposed.</td>

      <td>An Illinois law school drops his name as the left turns on the Court.</td>
      <td>The University of Illinois board of trustees last week entered a no-confidence vote against America’s greatest Supreme Court Chief Justice. Starting in July, the John Marshall Law School in Chicago will be known simply as the University of Illinois Chicago School of Law. The press release cites Marshall’s “role as a slave trader, slave owner of hundreds of slaves, pro-slavery jurisprudence, and racist views.”<br />This is the go-to progressive indictment of American historical figures. Never mind that Marshall’s muscular jurisprudence as Chief Justice from 1801 to 1835 forged a national government and economy powerful enough to finally smash slavery a generation after his death.<br />The U.S. is awash in iconoclasm, from Washington, D.C.’s bid to erase Benjamin Franklin from a city building, to the San Francisco school board’s vote to rename Abraham Lincoln High School. But the astonishing progressive turn on Marshall—law blogger Josh Blackman notes another law school may also cut ties—carries its own significance, intended or not.<br />Marshall’s legacy is at the heart of current Supreme Court debates. In a speech last month cautioning against Court-packing, Justice Stephen Breyer appealed to Marshall’s legal authority. He explained how Marshall deftly “strengthened the norm of judicial review” despite resistance from Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson.<br />Justice Breyer’s point: The political branches can try to defy courts when it suits their interests, and they do in other countries all the time. The rule of law is fragile. Marshall helped entrench it in the early U.S., but tampering politically with the Supreme Court could undo that achievement.</td>

      <td>The U.S. barrels toward a repeat of the Obama deal despite no inspector access to crucial sites.</td>
      <td>The news in the Middle East these days suddenly seems like a return to circa 2014. Israel and the U.S. are at odds over the Palestinians, America is courting Iran, and the Abraham Accords between Israel and the Arabs get the back of America’s hand.<br />In other words, President Biden is rejecting the Trump strategy that focused on containing Iran and forging closer ties among America’s traditional allies. Team Biden is returning to the Obama calculation that engaging Iran is the key to reducing America’s footprint in the Middle East, even if it means creating anxiety for Israel and the Gulf Arabs.<br />Nowhere is this clearer than in the hell-bent U.S. attempt to revive the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. A revival of the agreement will reshape the Middle East for years—and not to the benefit of U.S. interests.<br />Donald Trump left the 2015 deal three years ago and pursued a “maximum-pressure” sanctions campaign. The new economic restrictions targeted Iran’s nuclear malfeasance, as well as its support for terrorism abroad and violation of human rights at home. An isolated Iranian economy contracted 6% in 2018 and 6.8% in 2019, and Tehran responded by stepping up nuclear activity proscribed by the deal.<br />Rather than seeking a better deal as the Islamic Republic struggles with domestic unrest, Iranian and American diplomats have spent more than six weeks in Vienna negotiating through intermediaries a way back to the nuclear deal. The Biden Administration is sending stronger signals by the week that it will give up most of its leverage over Tehran to get a deal.</td>

      <td>A Democratic Governor stands up to his state’s never-enough caucus.</td>
      <td>Connecticut’s budget surplus this year is projected to be $470 million. Its rainy-day fund will hit an all-time high of $4.5 billion. Federal coronavirus relief is bringing $6 billion into the state. So the Legislature, naturally, is proposing to raise taxes. Give Gov. Ned Lamont credit for saying no.<br />Connecticut used to be the low-tax haven with a quick ride to Manhattan, but decades of tax-and-spend policies have eroded its comparative advantage. Today the state taxes capital gains as regular income, with rates up to 6.99%. State lawmakers now want to add a “surcharge” on high earners, meaning a combined cap-gains rate of 8.99% on single filers making more than $500,000.<br />The argument that it’s only a couple of extra points doesn’t wash, especially once Uncle Sam gets his share. The federal government’s top rate on capital gains is 23.8%, but President Biden wants to lift that to 43.4%. Mr. Biden also wants to add a capital-gains tax at death, in addition to the usual estate tax, so heirs couldn’t inherit assets with a stepped-up cost basis.<br />This is double taxation atop corporate taxes, and capital gains are not adjusted for inflation. The federal estate tax is 40%, and then throw in Connecticut’s estate tax up to 12%. Financiers are mobile, and estates in many places are taxed at the ultimate low rate of 0%. Add all this up, and you’d have to be high on nutmeg to stick around Connecticut.<br />The Legislature also wants to create what it bills as a “consumption tax.” People earning more than $500,000 would pay 0.7% of their adjusted gross income. That rate would rise to 1.4% for those earning $2 million, then 1.5% over $13 million. The money would go into a new Equitable Investment Fund, managed by an Equitable Investment Council, which would use it to reduce income inequality, redistribute to certain groups, and so on.</td>

      <td>The Belarus dictator orders his military to divert a civilian flight.</td>
      <td>The international order isn’t what it used to be, and the latest evidence is the astonishing decision by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko on Sunday to hijack an Irish passenger aircraft to arrest a blogger who is a political opponent.<br />Mr. Lukashenko personally ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet to intercept a  Ryanair  flight from Athens to Vilnius in Lithuania. Various press reports say the pretense of a bomb threat on the flight was used to divert the plane to land at Minsk airport, where 26-year-old Roman Protasevich was arrested. No bomb was found on the plane. Mr. Protasevich is among those sought by Belarussian security services for his role in the 2020 protests after Mr. Lukashenko stole the presidential election.<br />The implications of this state-sponsored hijacking aren’t pretty. A head of state used his military to order the diversion of a civilian flight between two European Union countries. His government lied about a bomb threat. And then it snatched a political opponent who was working in exile.<br />If this is allowed to be a precedent without consequences, expect more such hijackings for the purpose of making political arrests. Imagine how Vladimir Putin or North Korea might interpret this as a license to intercept civilian planes.<br />The risks of an accident are high, especially if a pilot refuses to cooperate with the hijacking government’s orders. Will the government then shoot the plane down? After the Belarus stunt, many pilots may refuse to believe claims of a bomb threat in the future.</td>

      <td>A tepid joint statement reveals that Biden still has no plan for handling China and North Korea.</td>
      <td>If an alliance’s strength were measured by the length of the joint statements its leaders issue when they meet, America’s bond with the Republic of Korea would be strong indeed. Friday’s discussions between President Biden and South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in, on his first Washington trip since Jan. 20, however, produced little of real consequence. Domestic priorities like climate change and Covid overshadowed international strategy.<br />Four months in, the Biden administration still lacks an Indo-Pacific blueprint, as this summit showed. Seoul and Washington face two major strategic issues, critical for themselves and the entire region. First, most immediately, is North Korea’s nuclear and conventional military threat. Second, longer-term and more strategic, is China’s growing philosophical, politico-military and economic assault against the U.S. and the Indo-Pacific generally.<br />Addressing these challenges effectively is central to any effort to refocus American attention on the region. Donald Trump and Barack Obama both failed to “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia, and Mr. Biden has stumbled out of the starting gate. Although purely coincidental, the Iran-Hamas assault on Israel proved again, as former British Prime Minister Harold McMillan allegedly once told a reporter, that “events, my dear boy, events” often determine the course of foreign affairs.<br />More important, the Moon-Biden meeting reveals that, after four months of anticipation, the U.S. administration is still offering rhetoric rather than substance. For example, American officials have repeatedly asserted that Mr. Biden’s North Korea policy is unlike his predecessors’, but the officials have been noticeably reticent on what it will be like. If anything, Mr. Moon seems to have pushed Mr. Biden toward the “action for action” process Pyongyang has preferred for decades.<br />On China, the Biden-Moon joint statement spoke only obliquely. For Seoul and Washington, reconceptualizing Beijing’s role regarding Pyongyang and the Indo-Pacific generally is long overdue. Treating China as merely another participant in the six-party nuclear talks, or as a disinterested “convener,” or as a “mediator,” ignores both the sustenance it has historically provided to the Kim family dictatorship and current reality. China has long hidden behind this camouflage, and the U.S. and others have too willingly acquiesced.</td>

      <td>‘Even paranoiacs,” said the truly paranoid poet Delmore Schwartz, “have real enemies.” I am neither a poet nor a paranoid, but I believe I have real enemies. I refer to the various people who call on both my landline and cellphone and send me bogus emails, all in the hope of cheating me out of money. Unlike the ultra-Orthodox Jewish private detective who was said to be on the case 24/6, these people work 24/7. I have had phone calls from some among them as early as 7:30 a.m. on weekdays and as late as 11:20 p.m. on a Sunday night.<br />The other day, opening my computer, I was greeted by an announcement, pretending to be from Amazon, asking if I had really purchased an $899  Samsung  television set that had been charged to my account. Since I hadn’t, the query, which came in with a Gmail address, was meant to send me into a panic about the scoundrel who had been buying things under my name, but intended really to send me into the dirty-fingernailed hands of the swindler who here pretended to represent Amazon.<br />Roughly two hours later I had a phone call from a young man purporting to be my grandson, who, the caller claimed, had been in a car accident and needed money urgently to cover the costs of the towing and damage to his car. “Where shall I send the money, Archie?” I asked. When the voice on the phone began to answer, I mentioned that I do indeed have a grandson but his name is Nick, and hung up. The people who set up these elaborate hoaxes, I am told, specialize in cheating older people, a category under which I qualify. The assumption here must be the older one is, the less likely to see through the scam. People suffering even mild dementia are especially vulnerable.<br />Two scam phone calls followed the fake Amazon email: one purportedly from Social Security citing complications on my monthly check and urging me to call a phone number immediately, the other asking me to renew the warranty on a car I haven’t owned since 2015, perhaps (I do not exaggerate here) the 200th such call I have received about this fictitious warrantee. Later in the day another caller—East Indian accent included at no extra charge—called to mention the $299 fee I owed for a recent installation of an imaginary bit of  Microsoft  software on my computer.<br />Then there were the calls from various charities—true charities or not, I do not know—which showed up on my caller ID under fake names (“Charlie Zucker” was one) with area codes matching my own. Who knew the country contained so many rogues, frauds and pure stinkers out there trying to do me out of my money?</td>

      <td>This is a good time to start building up capacity to fight the next novel pathogen.</td>
      <td>As Covid recedes, Congress and the Biden administration are turning their attention to making sure a novel pathogen can never paralyze the country again. An important part of that viral contingency plan is to have enough manufacturing capacity to scale up the production of vaccines and therapies.<br />Past discussions of pandemic preparedness have focused on developing a “warm base” by building some manufacturing sites, mothballing them, and turning the lights on when a new threat emerges. Covid proved that takes too much time. The country needs “hot” facilities, not merely warm ones.<br />When Covid struck, the U.S. didn’t have excess capacity to make monoclonal-antibody drugs or vaccines. Making room for antibody production required repurposing facilities that had been churning out other critical drugs whose production moved to Europe. This is an expensive, risky and time-consuming process. For vaccines, there wasn’t idle capacity to manufacture at scale. While factories were built mostly from scratch, vaccines had to be rationed for months.<br />There are lessons from the case of  Emergent BioSolutions  in the early 2000s. The country was preparing for the risk of a pandemic of H5N1 bird flu. The George W. Bush administration funded the construction of domestic facilities to make flu vaccines. But in many cases, in the years since these facilities, including Emergent, were not kept fully operational and properly staffed.<br />When Emergent’s plant was conscripted to make the Covid vaccine developed by  Johnson & Johnson ,  it stumbled getting the process up to sufficient scale and maintaining proper quality control. An internal government analysis concluded that, over the years, Emergent had struggled to attract and retain the specialized personnel required to run such a facility, leaving it vulnerable.</td>

They are no small matter for the U.S. either.<br />Up for grabs are unicameral state legislatures in 30 of 32 states and 15 governorships. But the midterm elections for the 500 seats in the House of Representatives weigh most heavily on the future of the democratic republic.<br />President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s Morena party already controls a simple majority in the Senate. If Morena and its smaller-party allies retain a two-thirds majority in the House, the president is expected to continue pushing—legally or illegally—his radical, anti-market agenda in the second half of his six-year term. If, on the other hand, his coalition wins only a simple majority, it will signal a sharp decline in public support and serve as confirmation that he has reached too far.<br />The risks to democratic capitalism if Morena has a strong showing go well beyond a damaging policy mix that lasts a few years. The messianic Mr. López Obrador’s ambition is to return Mexico to the days of state monopolies in the energy industry and a highly centralized government submissive to an all-powerful president—à la the authoritarianism of the 1970s.<br />To get there he needs to dismantle independent democratic institutions and dispense with the separation of powers. He has already shifted control of the Supreme Court in his favor, pushing one magistrate off the court by freezing his family’s financial assets and threatening a long, drawn out investigation. If the president can claim that the midterm elections give him a mandate, the temptation to further consolidate power in violation of the constitution may be too great to resist.</td>

Ms. Holmes has pleaded not guilty and faces an August trial, after several delays due to the coronavirus pandemic and news that she is due to give birth in July.<br />U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, Calif., issued a 100-page ruling Saturday night in response to more than 20 motions and three days of hearings over what evidence could be presented at trial.<br />Judge Davila ruled that the jury could hear testimony from patients and doctors who used Theranos tests and said they got inaccurate results. Ms. Holmes’s lawyers had argued such testimony would amount to using anecdotes to build the government’s fraud case, since the 11 patients identified weren’t a statistically significant sample from the millions of tests Theranos conducted.<br />Judge Davila disagreed. “Evidence of even one inaccurate result tends to show that Theranos was producing inaccurate results, even if it does not fully prove the point,” he wrote.</td>

One person said that it was provided by an international partner and was potentially significant but still in need of further investigation and additional corroboration.<br />Another person described the intelligence as stronger. “The information that we had coming from the various sources was of exquisite quality. It was very precise. What it didn’t tell you was exactly why they got sick,” he said, referring to the researchers.</td>

Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), who introduced a resolution to block the arms sale, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “The United States of America has got to be leading the world in bringing people together, not simply supplying weapons to kill children in Gaza….Our job is not simply to put more and more military support for Israel.”<br />The latest cycle of violence in Gaza placed a fresh spotlight on the conflict in the Middle East, which hadn’t been a priority for Mr. Biden amid the domestic crisis posed by the coronavirus pandemic and economic recession. The president and his administration privately pushed for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas amid the deadly violence, which killed more than 250 and injured hundreds more.</td>

I’ve known Mr. Cuban since the last tech bubble, when he famously sold Broadcast.com in 1999 to Yahoo! for $5.7 billion, more than  Apollo Global Management  paid Verizon for the remnants of Yahoo, AOL and even Netscape earlier this month. He smartly hedged his position and bought the Dallas Mavericks in 2000.<br />I’m not sure Mr. Cuban ever talks on the phone, but he’s sure quick with email responses.<br />“It depends what you ‘own,’ ” I shot back. By now, you’re probably familiar with the eye-opening $69 million dropped on NFT “artwork” by Beeple. Or the $2.9 million for the NFT of  Twitter  founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet, which you can easily see online: “just setting up my twttr.” I guess you own something, I’m just not sure what.<br />“The NFT is the authentication of what you own that is made public for anyone to see,” Mr. Cuban explains. Today, “all provenance is siloed and not public. NFTs can change that.”<br />Little did Mr. Cuban know that I had been poking around NBA Topshot for a highlight NFT of Mavericks star Luka Dončić. One cool NFT goes for $120. But what’s this? A 5% transaction fee? Even more surprising, the fine print says there are potentially 9,999 other “owners” of the same highlight with asking prices into the thousands for the same NFT.</td>

      <td>This stealthy infrastructure idea would create a mess of perhaps $1 trillion in politicized lending. Think Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</td>
      <td>As lawmakers debate the size and scope of President Biden’s proposed infrastructure-related stimulus plan, not enough attention is being paid to some of the details. Consider the roughly 1% of the $2.3 trillion spending package designated to create a “Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator,” which would “mobilize private investment” in the “clean energy economy.”<br />Cut through the greenspeak, and the administration is proposing to establish a bank with a direct line to the U.S. Treasury that would serve as a permanent financing conduit channeling tax money to support and subsidize politically favored clean energy projects.<br />Competing bills are already working their way through both houses of Congress to set up such a new federal entity, variously referred to as a “United States Green Bank” and a “National Climate Bank.” Since Democratic lawmakers are effectively negotiating with themselves, the bidding has started higher than the White House’s request—$50 billion up front and $100 billion over time under one Senate version. The potential cost to the American public of such a green government spigot could easily increase nearly 40-fold over the $27 billion currently penciled into Mr. Biden’s American Jobs Plan.<br />The argument for a federal green bank is flawed in many respects. For one, there is a truth-in-advertising problem. Banks are conservatively managed, highly regulated financial institutions that mainly engage in deposit-taking on the liability side and lending on the asset side of the balance sheet—neither of which would be central to the business mix of a federal green bank. Rather, in the Democrats’ imagining, a federal green bank’s core capital-providing business would include such high-risk activities as taking noncontrolling private-equity stakes in green energy ventures and funding research on new breakthrough clean technologies.<br />The green bank’s investment decision-making would be largely driven by noncommercial, political factors, including the requirement that 40% of capital flows be directed toward “disadvantaged communities facing climate impacts” and the need for bank-financed projects to pay prevailing union wage rates.</td>

      <td>A GOP-ordered audit of 2020 ballots in Arizona’s most populous county is scheduled to restart this week, even as it is fueling an escalating fight among Republicans in the state.<br />Republicans in Arizona’s senate ordered the audit of roughly 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, that began in April. Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona by just over 10,000 votes out of more than 3.3 million cast statewide, in part due to a roughly two-percentage-point victory in Maricopa.<br />Critics, including some Arizona Republicans, say the audit has been mismanaged and run by an unqualified contractor and that it could undermine confidence in the voting system by amplifying unproven allegations. The dispute is the latest example of divisions within the party over how to reckon with President Biden’s election win.<br />In a recent letter sent to Karen Fann, the Republican president of Arizona’s senate, the GOP-majority Maricopa County Board of Supervisors and other county officials said the audit wasn’t being conducted in good faith. “Your ‘audit,’ no matter what your intentions were in the beginning, has become a spectacle that is harming all of us,” they wrote. “Our state has become a laughingstock. Worse, this ‘audit’ is encouraging our citizens to distrust elections, which weakens our democratic republic.”<br />Ms. Fann said the audit isn’t intended to overturn the county’s election results, which were certified for Mr. Biden. Instead, she said many voters still have questions about the integrity of the voting system and that the audit is meant to provide answers. She also said that the audit will help lawmakers determine whether there are reasons to change Arizona’s election procedures to ensure the security of the system.</td>

She has risen to prominence—and gained bipartisan support—as Democrats and Republicans alike have said lax antitrust enforcement, especially in the tech sector, has allowed dominant firms to hobble rivals and stifle competition.<br />Her targets have included not just Big Tech but also Big Chocolate and others. She has argued for hawkish positions that would overhaul legal doctrine and go well beyond the approach of recent antitrust enforcers. While her most ardent supporters believe such changes are long overdue, her views have prompted a debate on whether her approach is realistic and potentially so sweeping that it could prove jarring to the economy.<br />“Stepped-up antitrust enforcement is one thing,” said Howard University law professor Andrew Gavil, who was a top FTC staffer the last time Democrats controlled the commission. “Changing the standards is a different matter,” he said.<br />Mr. Gavil, who favors more enforcement, said Ms. Khan will have to consider how to translate her views into something that can be applied in practice. “That’s more challenging than simply being a critic on the outside,” he said.</td>

[they] . . . represent the best and brightest among us,” he says.<br />But the current paradigm is itself clearly subjective and biased, with recent college admissions scandals merely serving roles as exhibits. Imperfect and biased systems often need active correction, not merely the application of the “tincture of time.”<br />An example, known I’m sure to Dr. Krauss and other (nominal) objectivists, is the spherical aberration error in the original Hubble Deep Space telescope mirror. Of course this error was only identified subsequently when expectant scientists viewed its skewed and imperfect version of reality.<br />Did the scientists and engineers accept and work around these imperfect images, and wait for a new telescope to be launched in a future generation? They did not. They ingeniously and quickly designed, launched and installed a set of corrective lenses that could account for and correct the original errors. Seen only through the corrective (biased) lenses, of course, the image was distorted and unclear. But when combined with the imperfect original, they were able to effectively achieve their goal in their lifetimes: to see more clearly and thus to better understand our world.<br />Making diversity an explicit near-term priority for scientific leadership is similarly a corrective step, designed to allow the various scientific bureaucracies and academies to more fully realize their missions: balanced and accurate scientific policy, and the just recognition of scientific excellence.</td>

The Great Lakes environment is an excuse to help meet the goal of transitioning, ASAP, from fossil fuels to a nation powered entirely by renewable sources of electricity, regardless of the cost to the taxpayers or our good neighbor and longtime ally, Canada. The game plan is simply delay, deny or revoke permits associated with fossil-fuel projects for any reason, and environmental excuses are the easiest to drum up.<br />Fewer producing wells coupled with higher transportation and refining costs will make renewables seem more palatable, and federal as well as state subsidies of renewables will further advance the goal.<br />Lawrence L.

The answer has big implications, in particular, for inflation.<br />In a recent survey, business leaders in the eurozone told the European Central Bank that they expect some spending to divert away from consumer goods, a shift that could take the pressure off factories around the world that have strained to meet demand. That demand has created bottlenecks in supply chains, a scramble for raw materials and long delays in shipping—pressures that caused a sharp rise in prices.<br />Others, however, believe that it is unlikely an increase in spending on services as economies reopen will clear those logjams. Indeed, they believe that households have built up so much in savings that they can spend on both goods and services.</td>

Relying on data analytics, company executives concluded that a digital generation demanded instant gratification, so they pivoted toward Lego sets with larger components that could be completed more quickly.<br />Big mistake. Sales tanked further.<br />Hurtling toward bankruptcy, company executives rededicated themselves to listening to their potential customers rather than treating them as data points, according to Martin Lindstrom, a branding consultant who was brought in to help with the effort and to whom Lego referred questions.<br />And so it was that an 11-year-old boy in Germany mentioned to a team of Lego researchers that the worn-down and pocked soles on his sneakers were evidence of his prowess on a skateboard. “They are my trophy,” the boy said.</td>

      <td>Entrepreneurs are increasingly wary about the money-raising tool after watching peers’ stocks slide and investors balk</td>
      <td>Startup chief executives are turning a cold shoulder to SPACs.<br />Skeptical CEOs say they are turning down offers from special-purpose acquisition companies, deleting their solicitous emails and tapping the brakes on merger deals amid nosediving shares and disappointed investors.<br />So-called blank-check companies, which go public with no assets and then merge with private companies, exploded in popularity last year as a mechanism for startups to raise a lot of money with more speed and fewer regulatory hurdles than a traditional initial public offering.<br />More recently, startup CEOs have watched many of their peers endure stock slides and earnings calls with disappointed investors in the weeks after finishing a SPAC deal. For many, it has been a bitter reality check that public-market investors might not be as generous as SPAC creators have been with early-stage companies with unpredictable revenue and growing pains.<br />“The reluctance is palpable,” said Adam J. Epstein, who advises startup CEOs and their boards. “It’s gone from being a bona fide alternative path to an IPO to ‘We don’t really want to be a punchline.’”</td>

      <td>Amazon’s second-generation earbuds have active noise-canceling and hands-free Alexa—and cost less than competition from Apple, Samsung and Bose</td>
      <td>I’ve worn earbuds more over this past year than any other. Between video calls and workouts at home, it felt like I was constantly putting some sort of implement in my ear.<br />Wireless earbuds have become essential—as has noise-canceling technology to drown out the sounds of housemates. If you’re looking for a new pair, and are leery of dropping $249 on Apple’s shiny Pro ’pods, consider  Amazon ’s  recent update to its Bluetooth buds.<br />The second-generation Echo Buds have active noise cancellation and built-in, hands-free Alexa. They’re smaller and sound better than the previous model—and they’re cheaper too.<br />The price—$120, or $140 with a wireless charging case—is why these headphones are worth your attention. Noise-canceling earbuds from companies like Apple,  Samsung  and Bose all cost over $200. For significantly less, Amazon’s set offers similar audio quality and sound-blocking cancellation, with some trade-offs.<br />Active noise-canceling doesn’t only seal out sound; it uses microphones to listen to ambient noise, then generates opposing sound waves to eradicate it. (If it helps, think of lining peaks with troughs, and troughs with peaks.) Good noise canceling is difficult to do, especially in small, marble-size earbuds.</td>

      <td>BEIJING—Twenty-one people running a mountain ultramarathon died in northwestern China after hail, freezing rain and gale-force winds hit the high-altitude race, state-run media reported Sunday.<br />After an all-night rescue operation in freezing temperatures involving more than 700 personnel, rescuers were able to confirm that 151 people were safe, out of a total of 172 participants. Twenty-one had died, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency, which said the runners suffered from physical discomfort and the a sudden drop in temperature.<br />The runners were racing on an extremely narrow mountain path at an altitude reaching 6,500-9,800 feet. The 60-mile race was held Saturday in the Yellow River Stone Forest tourist site in Baiyin, in Gansu province.<br />Among those who died was Liang Jing, a well-known runner who had won a 62-mile race in Ningbo, reported the Paper, a state-backed newspaper based in Shanghai.<br />A woman who worked for the race organizer, Gansu Shengjing Sports Culture Development Co., said there were no predictions of extreme weather for the day of the race, according to Beijing News, a paper owned by the Beijing city government.</td>

      <td>INDIANAPOLIS—Nineteen months after she last competed, Simone Biles has returned to claim the hardest vault in women’s gymnastics history as her reward for the delayed Olympic Games.<br />Biles on Saturday evening became the first female gymnast to perform a “Yurchenko double pike”—a vault that isn’t currently in the women’s rulebook and scoring system, requiring judges to assign it a provisional difficulty value of 6.6.<br />That score would make it the hardest vault that has ever been completed by a woman—though Biles and her coaches continue to believe it should be rated more highly still.<br />Biles powerfully delivered the vault at the 2021 GK U.S. Classic, where it was one of several stunning versions of the move she casually tossed out in warm-ups over the course of the event.<br />Her adrenaline-filled bounce on the landing, for an execution score of 9.5, suggests there is still room for improvement in her next three planned competitions: the U.S. Championships in two weeks, U.S. Olympic team trials at the end of June, and then the Olympic Games scheduled to open in Tokyo on July 23.</td>
