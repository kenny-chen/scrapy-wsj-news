      <td>Even if Covid-19 vaccines become widespread, business travel is likely to be changed by the pandemic. Travel budgets have been slashed and some meetings will remain virtual; conferences and conventions may be crimped.<br />But by how much? It matters not only to airlines and their employees but also their customers—travelers. That’s because higher fares paid by corporate customers actually subsidize cheap fares for vacationers. What’s more, less business travel means that airlines schedule fewer flights on business routes, like trips to New York, Chicago, London and Tokyo. That means fewer seats for leisure travelers.<br />Estimates of permanent change in the airline industry have ranged from the CEOs of American, United and Delta all saying business travel will come roaring back in full, though it may take a few years, to observers like Bill Gates who recently suggested half of all business travel will never return.<br />Guesses aside, a look at data suggests between 19% and 36% of all air trips are likely to be lost, based on a business-travel analysis I worked on with three airline-industry veterans.<br />“Brick-and-mortar retail has been devastated by ecommerce and I think this is a parallel story,’’ says Jay Sorensen, president of IdeaWorks, an airline-industry consulting firm and a member of our group. The others are Ben Baldanza, former chief executive of Spirit Airlines and a current board member of  JetBlue ,  and consumer advocate Charlie Leocha, president of Travelers United, a passenger-advocacy organization.</td>

If successful, it would be one of the largest commercial real-estate funds ever to focus on minority neighborhoods.<br />Martin Muoto, chief executive of the real-estate firm SoLa Impact LLC, already runs three funds totaling $180 million. They focus on affordable housing and some commercial real estate in minority neighborhoods around South Los Angeles. The funds, which raised money from large investors like the private-equity firm General Atlantic, have recorded double-digit average annual returns since the first fund launched in 2014.<br />Now, Mr. Muoto is trying to use a similar approach in cities across the U.S. that suffer from a shortage of affordable housing and from what he said are regulatory barriers that make it tougher to build. His new Black Impact Fund is focusing on large metropolises like Philadelphia and Atlanta, as well as midsize cities like Fresno, Calif.<br />SoLa has been investing in opportunity zones, a program created by the 2017 federal tax overhaul that allows investors to defer and reduce taxes if they reinvest capital gains in designated low-income communities.<br />Critics of the program say it sometimes misses the mark, like when states earmark neighborhoods where development is already taking place. That could give investors a significant tax break without creating many new jobs or more affordable housing in poorer neighborhoods.</td>

      <td>BERLIN— Pfizer Inc.  partner BioNTech and U.S. drugmaker  Moderna Inc.  both applied for their coronavirus vaccines to be approved in the European Union, the EU’s chief medicines regulator said Tuesday, with officials expected to make a decision on at least one of the vaccines by the end of the month.<br />The announcement brings hope that the EU will soon be able to start vaccinating its 448 million people against a disease that has done some of its earliest and worst damage on the continent.<br />The European Medicines Agency said its officials will work through Christmas to review whether data from trials show sufficient proof of the two vaccines’ safety and effectiveness. If so, the vaccines could be marketed as soon as this month, according to people familiar with the discussions. The EMA is set to make a judgment on the BioNTech vaccine first, by Dec. 29 at the latest, giving that candidate a two-week edge in the vaccine race over Moderna’s candidate. The agency will then decide whether to authorize the Moderna vaccine by Jan. 12, officials said.<br />The submission marked a milestone in the race to supply the world with a working vaccine to end the pandemic, said Ugur Sahin, the chief executive of BioNTech.<br />“We will continue to work with regulatory agencies around the world to enable the rapid distribution, should the vaccine receive the approval, contributing to the joint efforts to let the world heal and regain its normal pace of life,” Dr. Sahin said.</td>

      <td>Congress faces looming deadlines in lame-duck session</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Lawmakers start a year-end sprint this week to keep the government running, provide more coronavirus aid and pass an annual defense bill, with President Trump’s focus on challenging his election loss injecting more uncertainty into the legislative outcome.<br />As the pandemic surges nationwide, Democratic and Republican leaders are under increasing pressure from rank-and-file lawmakers to agree on some Covid relief, prodded in part by the looming expiration of aid provisions from bills passed earlier this year. Those include broadened unemployment insurance coverage as well as expanded paid sick and family leave.<br />They are also working to complete a full-year spending bill before the government’s current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 12. And Congress must still pass the annual defense policy bill, which has broad bipartisan support—despite a veto threat from the president over a provision that would rename military bases honoring the Confederacy.<br />Even if lawmakers who have been mired in disagreements for months can finally coalesce around their year-end list, they will need cooperation from Mr. Trump, who has refused to concede the presidential race and continues to make allegations of fraud that have been dismissed in court.<br />Lawmakers have made the most progress on the fastest-approaching deadline: keeping the government running beyond Dec. 11, when its current funding expires. Last week, Senate Republicans and House Democrats agreed on how to divvy up the $1.4 trillion pot of money across the 12 spending bills that fund the government. Now they are scurrying to complete those and produce a full-year spending bill by the weekend or early next week, aides said.</td>

      <td>Credit Suisse Group AG  named António Horta-Osório as its next chairman Tuesday, marking a changing of the guard after a decade under current chairman Urs Rohner punctuated by regulatory fines and scandal.<br />Mr. Horta-Osório had said in July he was leaving his job as chief executive at Britain’s  Lloyds Banking Group  PLC. It named his successor on Monday. The Portuguese executive is one of Europe’s most highly regarded bankers after a turnaround at Lloyds, and Mr. Rohner said he brings an “impressive record of accomplishments.” Shareholders will vote on the proposed appointment at the bank’s annual meeting in April. Mr. Rohner had said he would leave Credit Suisse when he hits a 12-year board-term limit at that meeting.<br />Under Mr. Rohner, Credit Suisse’s run-in with regulators included a $2.6 billion settlement and guilty plea with the U.S. Justice Department in 2014 for conspiring to aid tax evasion by wealthy Americans, and a $5.3 billion settlement in 2017 with U.S. authorities over toxic mortgage securities sold before the 2008 financial crisis.<br />Earlier this year, the bank ousted former CEO Tidjane Thiam for failing to contain the reputational fallout from a scandal that involved bank staff being followed by private investigators. The Wall Street Journal on Monday reported that lawyers hired by Credit Suisse found two incidents of the bank putting employees under observation by investigators, predating two others in 2019 that the bank had blamed on an executive who was fired. Switzerland’s financial regulator started enforcement proceedings on how the bank controls and documents such activities in September. Those proceedings are ongoing and Credit Suisse says it is cooperating.<br />Mr. Thiam was succeeded by Thomas Gottstein, who had run Credit Suisse’s domestic Swiss unit.</td>

      <td>Weak gift card sales could be an obstacle to full recovery for chains like Cheesecake Factory and Outback Steakhouse</td>
      <td>Casual dining stocks have almost fully recovered from the coronavirus pandemic. One hurdle they still have to face: an uncertain holiday gift season.<br />A resurgence in coronavirus cases means additional capacity restrictions at restaurants and reduced demand for eating out. Seated diners at U.S. restaurants were down 48% from a year ago as of Sunday, according to data from OpenTable. Many independent restaurants have closed as financial pressures intensify.<br />Publicly traded sit-down restaurant chains are hardly worse for wear, however: shares of  Darden Restaurants ,  which owns Olive Garden and other brands, are down about 11% since the pre-virus high in February, while  Cheesecake Factory  stock is down 10% over that same period.  Brinker International ,  which owns Chili’s, is actually up about 19% so far in 2020.<br />But the arrival of the holiday season means another big question for investors in a year full of them: Will shoppers buy gift cards for the chains at the same rate as before? More than half of annual gift card sales for the industry occur around the holidays, according to Wells Fargo Securities analyst Jon Tower. Under U.S. accounting rules, restaurants book revenue from the gift card when it is redeemed, instead of when it is sold.<br />The result is that meals paid for with a gift card traditionally account for a meaningful amount of first-quarter sales: In 2019, according to Mr. Tower, redemptions accounted for 14% of first-quarter restaurant sales at  Outback Steakhouse -parent Bloomin’ Brands, and 9% at Cheesecake Factory. Other companies have a lower share of card sales, but even small revenue declines can lead to big hits to profits in a high transaction, low-margin business like dining.</td>

But this time, investors are less concerned.<br />Shares of several publicly traded hospital systems finished November with their best performances in months, with national hospital operators including  Tenet Healthcare Corp.  and  HCA Healthcare Inc.  both jumping at least 21%. That is far better than the S&P 500’s 11% monthly gain and the 7.8% rise for the index’s health-care sector.<br />November sent the U.S. stock market on yet another wild ride, driven by a string of positive Covid-19 vaccine results and a quicker-than-expected resolution of the presidential election. Both events helped push major U.S. stock indexes to new records as traders scrambled to scoop up investments that have been beaten-down this year. In addition to hospital stocks, shares of retailers, restaurants, energy stocks and cruise liners also jumped. Elsewhere across financial markets, crude oil, junk bonds and metals such as copper and platinum rallied.<br />On its face, the recent outperformance of hospital stocks could be perceived as one of the beneficiaries of the latest round of bargain-hunting by investors—after all, hospital chains such as Tenet and  Universal Health Services Inc.  are both still trading 11% or more below their respective 2020 highs after plunging during the market rout.</td>

Floor after floor of empty office space is a source of great frustration for landlords and companies, which have invested millions of dollars in adapting building plans and developing new health protocols to make employees comfortable with a shared location.<br />About a quarter of employees had returned to work as of Nov. 18, according to Kastle Systems, a security firm that monitors access-card swipes in more than 2,500 office buildings in 10 of the largest U.S. cities.<br />That rate is up sharply from an April low of less than 15%, which largely consisted of building-maintenance and essential workers. The office return rate climbed steadily during the summer and early fall, but it has flattened out after reaching a high point of 27% in mid-October, Kastle said. The rate for last week was down even more sharply than in previous weeks but likely reflected the Thanksgiving Day holiday.<br />“There’s a huge headwind against company executives to strongly push their employee bases to come back to work,” said Douglas Linde, president of big office owner  Boston Properties Inc.</td>

The freeze is among the biggest granted by the court, according to lawyers who work there.<br />The case is part of a set of civil court disputes involving BTA in the U.S., U.K. and more than a dozen other jurisdictions.

BTA alleged that the stolen money ended up in hidden bank accounts and assets around the world including a shopping mall in Cincinnati.<br />A U.K. court in 2012 ruled in BTA’s favor, issuing a $4.9 billion civil judgment against the former bank chairman, Mukhtar Ablyazov, and Iliyas Khrapunov, his son-in-law.

      <td>Manhattan wine store owner Tom Geniesse is busy filling online orders and boxing up holiday shipments, but no matter how many e-commerce platforms he joins, internet sales can’t make up for the decline in foot traffic outside his shop on West 19th Street.<br />Mr. Geniesse designed Bottlerocket Wine & Spirit for in-person browsing by both wine lovers and neighborhood regulars, with one display pairing wine suggestions with takeout menus from nearby restaurants. But the coronavirus pandemic has quieted the once bustling neighborhood, as many residents decamped to the suburbs and few office workers stop in to pick up a bottle or two on their way home. While retail wine sales are up 19% this year nationwide, according to research firm Nielsen, Mr. Geniesse said his revenue is down about 35%.<br />“That normal, daily, neighborhood wine-store business has evaporated,” he said. “Nineteenth Street was really happening and vibrant. Now it’s not a ghost town, but it’s definitely a shadow of its normal self.”<br />The Flatiron and Union Square neighborhoods were thriving before the pandemic, with residents, office workers, tourists and college students supporting its restaurants and stores. A study last year by the New York City Department of City Planning found that, while other parts of Manhattan struggled with skyrocketing real-estate prices and high storefront vacancy, the Flatiron and Union Square retail corridor was relatively stable. In 2018, just over 9% of the district’s storefronts were vacant, compared with nearly 26% on Canal Street and 14% in SoHo.<br />A follow-up survey conducted in July showed the extent of the pandemic’s impact. The number of inactive storefronts in the district, including those that were closed and vacant, jumped 36%, according to the planning department, which attributed the closures in part to the decline in commuters and tourists.</td>
