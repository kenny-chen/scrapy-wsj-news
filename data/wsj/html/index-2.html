      <td>Myanmar’s military leader has taken charge of the country from its civilian-run government, according to a statement broadcast on an army-run television station, after Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of her party were detained in a morning raid.<br />The coup marks a major setback to the country’s transition from military rule to democracy, which began about a decade ago. The U.S. and human-rights groups called on the military to adhere to democratic norms.<br />Tensions have been rising for days over the results of a November election that Ms. Suu Kyi’s party won by a landslide. The army-backed opposition party called the election, only the second truly contested and democratic vote since the end of military rule in the Southeast Asian country, fraudulent. Myanmar’s election commission has denied the claims.<br />Parliament was scheduled to convene on Monday for its first session since the election.<br />“The United States is alarmed by reports that the Burmese military has taken steps to undermine the country’s democratic transition,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said about the developments in Myanmar, also known as Burma. “The United States opposes any attempt to alter the outcome of recent elections or impede Myanmar’s democratic transition, and will take action against those responsible if these steps are not reversed.”</td>

      <td>China’s short-term lending rates shot up to their highest levels in two years last week</td>
      <td>Markets in the U.S. are going haywire, but since the economy is also in the tank, central bankers are hesitant to step in and spoil the fun. Not so in China. Markets there look bubbly too and the central bank isn’t amused.<br />China’s short-term lending rates shot up to their highest levels in two years last week, with the weighted average of the one-day interbank collateralized repo hitting nearly 7% Friday. As recently as Friday, Jan. 22, it was only 2.5%. Chinese short-term borrowing rates often jump ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday as holiday cash demand rises, but usually the central bank offsets that with big injections into the banking system. This time, not so much: the People’s Bank of China had hardly added any net liquidity in January as of mid last week, Morgan Stanley noted on Wednesday. Adding to investors’ skittishness, Chinese media last week reported comments from Ma Jun, an adviser to the central bank, warning of asset bubbles.<br />All of this should tell investors a couple things. First, policy makers believe that the risks of turbulence in the bond market—which was rocked by the defaults of several state-owned firms in November—have receded. After central bank data showed net corporate bond financing falling abruptly to its lowest levels since 2018 in November and December, bond financing has now apparently recovered. By mid-January, yields had dropped back and January data from Wind shows that net corporate bond financing has bounced back as well.<br />Second, Beijing still feels comfortable enough with the pace of the recovery—despite weaker-than-expected economic data in December and a faltering January purchasing managers index—to let market rates rise as a warning to stock and real-estate speculators. Before the sharp rise in interbank rates last week, Shenzhen’s tech-heavy ChiNext index had shot up about 13% this year and Shenzhen A-shares as a whole were trading at around 25 times the next 12 months expected earnings according to FactSet, their priciest since 2016. Overall margin debt in China had also started rising rapidly again.<br />China’s recovery is far ahead of the West’s, as its credit growth cycle has already peaked. That means, most likely, the peak in earnings growth isn’t far behind. With U.S. stocks in full-blown euphoria, China might seem like a better bet—but both on fundamentals and liquidity, the rally in Chinese stocks might actually run out of steam first.</td>

It runs video advertisements, has an Instagram account, and posts job openings on LinkedIn. It even launched a splashy new website in January whose content includes an advice column and dog-training tips, plus a bold new black-and-white logo.<br />The CIA hopes these efforts will convince the millions of millennials and Gen-Zers scrolling through their phones and streaming TV to consider a career in intelligence.<br />“We had to go where the talent is,” says Sheronda Dorsey, the CIA’s deputy associate director for talent, who is now on LinkedIn herself.<br />The agency has always relied on a steady influx of young people, especially recent college graduates, but has periodically faced challenges hiring them. Students frequently protested on-campus CIA recruiters in the 1960s, for instance.</td>

The discussions were described as preliminary and aren’t ongoing but could come back in the future, the people said.<br />Such a deal would reunite the two largest descendants of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly, which was broken up by U.S. regulators in 1911, and reshape the oil industry.<br />A combined company’s market value could top $350 billion. Exxon has a market value of $190 billion, while Chevron’s is $164 billion. Together, they would likely form the world’s second largest oil company by market capitalization and production, producing about 7 million barrels of oil and gas a day, based on pre-pandemic levels, second only in both measures to Saudi Aramco.<br />But a merger of the two largest American oil companies could encounter regulatory and antitrust challenges under the Biden administration. President Biden has said climate change is one of the biggest crises the country faces. In October, he said he would push the country to “transition away from the oil industry.” He hasn’t been as vocal about antitrust matters, and the administration has yet to nominate the Justice Department’s head of that division.</td>

      <td>Can a state collect income tax from nonresidents working remotely for in-state businesses? Massachusetts, New York and some other states claim they can, and now New Hampshire is asking the Supreme Court to protect its citizens from this tax grab.<br />Tens of millions of Americans have been working from home during the pandemic, including an estimated 2.1 million who used to commute to the office across state lines. Enter Massachusetts, which in April adopted an emergency regulation declaring that nonresidents employed in the state before the pandemic must still pay its 5% income tax even if they are working remotely.<br />Most states tax only income earned—proportional to their employment activities—within their borders. So a hedge-fund manager who splits his time equally between offices in Fairfield, Conn., and Miami only has to pay Connecticut income tax on half his salary. The same rule applies for athletes, consultants and other professionals.<br />However, five states besides Massachusetts (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Arkansas, Nebraska) tax nonresidents working at home. New York requires nonresidents who telecommute for an in-state employer to pay its income tax unless “necessity, as distinguished from convenience, obligate the employee to out-of-state duties.”<br />If an employee of a New York-based firm chooses to work most days from home in another state, New York still taxes him as if he worked the entire day in Manhattan. In October state tax regulators said there would be no pandemic exception for nonresident telecommuters unless their employer “established a bona fide employer office at [the] telecommuting location.”</td>

      <td>Portland may kill Oregon’s only glass-bottle recycling plant.</td>
      <td>Here’s a story straight out of Portlandia. In the name of improving air quality and addressing climate change, the Rose City is considering penalties that could drive a recycling plant out of business and kill union jobs.<br />Portland declared a climate emergency last year, and the City Council voted to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. To meet this goal that would have no effect on the climate, Portland’s Bureau of Planning and Sustainability wants to impose some $11 million in annual fees on city businesses. Facilities deemed “major stationary sources of air pollution” would pay an annual surcharge of up to $40,000, and Portland would also impose a per-ton fee on any facility that emits more than 2,500 metric tons of C02 a year.<br />The carbon taxes would fall especially hard on Portland’s  Owens-Brockway  Glass Container plant, which handles all of the state’s glass-bottle recycling and processes the equivalent of 440,000 beer bottles a day on average. If the City Council adopts the proposal, the plant would have to pay an estimated $1.1 million a year, more than any Portland facility except the Evraz steel mill, according to the newspaper Willamette Week. The recycling plant pays $1.6 million in income, real-estate and property taxes.<br />United Steelworkers Local 330 represents some of the plant’s 115 employees, and president Bob Tackett says he has “a lot of concerns” about the consequences. “These jobs were green jobs before it was popular to be a green job,” and they come with high wages and good benefits, “so I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around why we’re trying to push these jobs away or penalize these jobs.”<br />In a letter to the Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, Owens-Brockway expressed “grave concerns” and warned that the taxes could “devastate select businesses.” Jules Bailey of the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative said that if the plant went bust, the state’s glass bottles would end up in landfills or be shipped out of state.</td>

      <td>Will he negotiate with the GOP or jam $1.9 trillion through on a party-lline vote?</td>
      <td>Americans are about to learn whether President Biden means what he has said so often about governing in a bipartisan fashion. The test is whether he negotiates with Senate Republicans over his $1.9 trillion Covid spending bill, or jams it through using a budget maneuver that requires only 50 votes plus Vice President Kamala Harris.<br />Democratic leaders seem eager to use what’s known as budget reconciliation that dodges the 60-vote filibuster bill for tax and spending measures with certain limitations. After even moderate Republican Senators balked at the gigantic size of the $1.9 trillion Biden Covid-palooza, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said they’ll move soon to pass the bill on a partisan basis using reconciliation.<br />Mr. Biden hasn’t committed himself to the Pelosi-Schumer strategy, though that seems to be where his advisers are tilting. The President speaks so little in public, and in such a scripted fashion, that it’s hard to know what he really thinks.<br />But 10 GOP Senators have raised the governing stakes for Mr. Biden when they offered to meet the President part way and asked for a meeting to talk it over. They say they’ll release more details on Monday, but the text of their weekend letter to Mr. Biden sure looks like it offers most of what he wants.<br />They commit to $160 billion for Covid-related spending on vaccine development and distribution, therapies, testing and tracing and PPE. They say, without offering a price tag, that they support more payments for individual Americans “with the greatest need, providing more targeted assistance than in the Administration’s plan.” That probably means a lower cutoff for additional $1,400 cash payments.</td>

      <td>The true story (so far as we can know it) of a woman from rural New York who became a highly productive OSS agent in WWII Spain.</td>
      <td>On the first page of this real-life espionage thriller, author Larry Loftis writes: “In most cases, a spy cannot survive without being a consummate liar.” For that reason, when a friend spoke admiringly of the works of Aline Griffith—a glamorous American who had been an agent in Spain during World War II and, decades later, wrote a series of memoirs about her exploits—Mr. Loftis decided to find out just how truthful her spy stories might be.<br />Mr. Loftis, whose last book was “Code Name: Lise” (2019), a biography of Britain’s most decorated female wartime spy, started with what Griffith had written herself. She was the author of several books, most notably the bestselling trilogy “The Spy Wore Red,” “The Spy Went Dancing” and “The Spy Wore Silk” (1987-91), all published under her married name—Aline, Countess of Romanones. A beautiful young ex-model, Griffith was sent to Madrid in 1944 as a coder, but her real assignment was to look for Nazi sympathizers. Dressed in Balenciaga, she infiltrated the highest echelons of Spanish society, entering a world of gala soirées, exclusive nightclubs and grand country estates. Throw in bullfights, flamenco, double agents and a handful of murders, and you have the makings of a page-turning literary franchise.<br />Mr. Loftis explains that it’s difficult for former spies to prove the veracity of events when, for security reasons, their reports have been omitted from official records. Spies are restricted by oaths of secrecy and don’t usually produce memoirs until decades after active service, so their recollections may be inaccurate or highly embellished.<br />A meticulous researcher, Mr. Loftis consulted the published and unpublished memoirs of Griffith’s colleagues, and compared her stories with theirs. He also pored over OSS records and recently declassified documents in Portugal and Spain. In the end, although he describes her books as “historical fiction,” he concluded that Griffith was indeed a highly productive agent, and despite elisions and embroidering, her overall story was legitimate. But she did make up numerous incidents and several murders. Mr. Loftis could confirm only one of the five killings she wrote about in her trilogy; it was verified by the person who carried the corpse away.<br />“The Princess Spy” is the kind of popular biography that quotes conversations verbatim and tells you what characters are thinking. Mr. Loftis recounts information from the countess’s books in instances where he feels the truth was borne out, and he’s scrupulously documented his findings in 63 pages of endnotes. He divides the story into short chapters that end with cliffhangers, like scenes from a film noir. The result is a fast-paced, edgy and highly engaging yarn.</td>

      <td>But new variants pose an undetermined threat. The flu-vaccine system can be a model for regulators.</td>
      <td>Some good news this week:  Johnson & Johnson ’s  vaccine looks likely to become the third U.S. Covid-19 vaccine to enter the market. The company released data this week showing the vaccine is about 70% effective against the virus, and its version requires only one shot. The Food and Drug Administration will need to review the evidence thoroughly, but the preliminary data is promising. The company is collecting more information to determine whether a booster shot could provide even better protection.<br />Crushing Covid will require making the most of the different vaccine candidates, which come with their own pros and cons, and tweaking them to stay ahead of viral mutations. The vaccines all follow a similar basic approach, putting into arms the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus. But Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine takes a slightly different approach to delivery than vaccines produced by  Pfizer  and Moderna. (I am on the board of Pfizer.) The biotech company  Novavax  is pursuing a vaccine candidate with its own special delivery system. All four might be available by the summer, which would mean an ample supply.<br />Americans will wonder which one works best? It will be tempting to compare data across trials. But that isn’t apples to apples; the vaccines and the data aren’t all the same. And new variants of Covid may demand vaccines that offer slightly different layers of protection and target slightly different parts of the virus.<br />The regulatory process must encourage this kind of portfolio diversification, while allowing tweaks to keep ahead of the virus’s twists and turns. The FDA is working on guidance to address new variants, which will include a pathway for updating vaccines.<br />The model should be the flu-vaccine process. Every year scientists develop the basic components for flu vaccines that are capable of targeting many different strains of the virus. But only the three or four strains expected to be most prevalent are put into production. The rest stay on the shelf, ready to be put into production should the flu take an unexpected evolutionary turn. The FDA should do the same for Covid.</td>

      <td>To hold his climate vows, he’ll have to downsize the fossil fuels industry aggressively—costing jobs.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration has hit the ground running on its climate agenda, but it’ll have to break into a dead sprint if it wants to reach its environmental goals. Before the sun had set on Inauguration Day, the Keystone XL pipeline project had been canceled (for the second time), oil and gas leasing activity had been suspended on federal lands (both onshore and offshore), and the U.S. had committed to rejoin the Paris Agreement. Yet none of these policies will come close to meeting the promises President Biden made during his campaign—notably, eliminating carbon pollution from domestic power plants by 2035 and realizing a “net zero” economy by 2050. To find out if he’ll take the radical steps necessary, watch the Dakotas.<br />Mr. Biden’s recent moves on energy policy will make future oil and gas expansion difficult, but that’s not going to be enough. The American energy industry is already consolidating after an unprecedented multiyear period of growth—punctured by last year’s pandemic-related demand shock—so the blow to the sector is likely to be glancing. If the president intends to keep his vows on carbon emissions and the like, his administration will have to reduce the size of the fossil fuel industry aggressively, not merely curtail its growth.<br />If he’s willing to do that—which seems likely given the cast of true climate believers slated to head up various regulatory agencies—the first target will probably be the Dakota Access Pipeline.<br />The 1,172-mile pipeline currently transports an average of 570,000 barrels a day of crude oil from the Bakken Formation beneath Montana and North Dakota to the Midwest and Gulf Coast refined-product markets. Dakota Access stalled in the waning days of the Obama administration but President Trump approved the project and it was placed into service in 2017.<br />Over the past three years, the pipeline and its corporate sponsor, Energy Transfer, have been dogged by lawsuits from Native American groups and environmentalists, even though the pipeline system has had no reported environmental or safety issues to date.</td>

      <td>She appreciated the first GOP president and carried a gun.</td>
      <td>President Biden may revive an Obama-era initiative of which conservatives ought to approve: putting Harriet Tubman on the obverse of the $20 bill, where Andrew Jackson now appears. Tubman, who died in 1913, was an abolitionist and civil-rights pioneer who’d been born into slavery circa 1822. Then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced in April 2016 that Jackson, the first Democratic president, would appear on the reverse of the Tubman note, which would enter circulation by 2020.<br />Mr. Lew said Tubman represented “the essential story of American democracy”: “So much of what we believe has changed for better for this country is reflected in what she struggled for.” But after Donald Trump, a Jackson admirer, became president, the Treasury changed its tune. Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in 2017 that the switch was still under consideration, but “people have been on the bills for a long period of time,” and there were “more important issues to focus on.” In 2019 Mr. Mnuchin announced that because of “counterfeiting issues,” the switch would be delayed until 2028.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki now says the Biden administration is “exploring ways to speed up” the change to the $20 bill. Republicans should claim Tubman as one of their own. She was friendly with William Seward, secretary of state to the first GOP president, Abraham Lincoln.<br />At first she didn’t admire Lincoln. Frustrated that white soldiers were paid more than black soldiers in the Union Army, she blamed the president for the disparity. “No, I’m sorry now, but I didn’t like Lincoln in them days,” she told Rosa Belle Holt in an 1896 interview for the Chautauquan. “I used [to] go see Mrs. Lincoln, but I never wanted to see him. You see, we colored people didn’t understand then he was our friend.” Although she never met Lincoln, Tubman’s opinion changed after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and met with her friend and fellow abolitionist Sojourner Truth in 1864.<br />Tubman would also likely have been an advocate for gun rights. She carried a pistol for protection when helping fugitive slaves achieve freedom through the Underground Railroad and when acting as a Union spy and scout during the Civil War.</td>

      <td>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador—a k a AMLO—has been known to bristle when critics liken him to the late Hugo Chávez. But the parallels between the spirit of Mr. López Obrador’s two-year-old government and that of the Venezuelan strongman’s in its early years are impossible to ignore.<br />Morena, AMLO’s party, launched an effort in the Mexican Senate in December to seize autonomy from the country’s central bank. The lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, will discuss the bill this week. The president seems to be backing off the idea, but if so it is only a tactical retreat.<br />AMLO is on a mission to complete what he calls “the fourth transformation” of Mexico, and he has to centralize power to do it. He has already wrested control of the Supreme Court, and last month he proclaimed that autonomous regulatory bodies like the federal antitrust commission and the office that provides transparency in federal contracts should be eliminated.<br />Ahead of the June midterm elections he is signaling that he is ready to buck the authority of two independent bodies charged with ensuring election fairness. Mexican democrats are in a fight for their political lives.<br />There are obvious differences between AMLO and Chávez. But when the history is written I suspect most of them will turn out to have been driven by economic constraints on the Mexican caudillo, not choice.</td>

Since March, Attorney General James has been investigating nursing homes throughout New York state based on allegations of patient neglect and other concerning conduct that may have jeopardized the health and safety of residents and employees.<br />Among those findings were that a larger number of nursing home residents died from COVID-19 than the New York State Department of Health’s (DOH) published nursing home data reflected and may have been undercounted by as much as 50 percent. . . .<br />Preliminary data obtained by OAG suggests that many nursing home residents died from COVID-19 in hospitals after being transferred from their nursing homes, which is not reflected in DOH’s published total nursing home death data. Preliminary data also reflects apparent underreporting to DOH by some nursing homes of resident deaths occurring in nursing homes. In fact, the OAG found that nursing home resident deaths appear to be undercounted by DOH by approximately 50 percent.</td>

      <td>Some firms targeted by followers of Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum are grappling with business difficulties</td>
      <td>In the past few weeks, investors have bid up the share prices of companies such as  GameStop Corp.  and  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,  as short sellers have bet against them. Here is an analysis of the challenges and prospects for these businesses.<br />GameStop is trying to survive a yearslong erosion of its business, which has relied for nearly four decades on people visiting its bricks-and-mortar stores to buy the latest videogames and consoles, as well as to trade in and purchase used games and gear.<br />The company has been stung by mounting competition from retail giants such as  Amazon.com Inc.  and  Walmart Inc.,  and the advancement of technology that enables people to download games directly from consoles and computers instead of buying hard copies. It has also gone through a period of high executive turnover, with Chief Executive George Sherman—a longtime retail executive who joined GameStop in 2019—being the fifth person to hold the role since November 2017.<br />To preserve its business, Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop has been working to pay down debt and pledged to accelerate its e-commerce operations. In the recent holiday season, the company’s e-commerce sales rose more than 300% from the comparable year-earlier period, helped by the release of new videogame consoles from  Microsoft Corp.  and  Sony Corp.<br />One of GameStop’s newest board members, Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen, urged the company last year to exit underperforming stores in the U.S. He also called for the company to close nonessential operations in Europe and Australia and use the proceeds to make tech improvements, such as revamping GameStop’s online store.</td>

      <td>Automatic government stimulus based on economic growth or unemployment rates opens the door to all sorts of manipulation.</td>
      <td>Jason Furman argues that “Biden’s Stimulus Should Stay the Course” (op-ed, Jan. 26) with an enhancement that would put it on autopilot to continue assistance as long as the economy is weak and needs it. He proposes that the stimulus be upgraded to “recession insurance” available on a permanent basis to mitigate future economic downturns. Rather than rely on politicians to rise to the challenge when crises first hit, poor economic results would trigger immediate increases in unemployment benefits, automatic fiscal assistance for states and more federal funding for other benefits such as nutritional assistance. Recession-triggered spending would phase out when no longer needed.<br />A permanent autopilot for recession-fighting stimulus is a tempting but ultimately terrible idea. Automatic government stimulus based on economic growth or unemployment rates opens the door to all sorts of manipulation, gaming of the system, counterproductive behavior and unintended consequences. Businesses, investors, workers and consumers make decisions based on expectations. Will a softening of the economy prompt, say, quicker and more consequential decisions that accelerate layoffs and belt-tightening because Washington will be an automatic backstop? In theory, establishing automatic triggers for wages and benefits to rise when inflation goes up is a way to protect people, but the real-world effect of an economywide inflation protection would be an out-control-price spiral.<br />An autopilot for stimulus likely would affect wage, hiring and layoff decisions by corporations, and spending and taxing decisions by state and local governments. If Washington provides a safety net for states whenever the economy softens, there is a disincentive for states to ever bite the bullet and be more fiscally prudent.<br />Mark Adams<br />Atlanta</td>

Josh Hawley after the original publisher, Simon & Schuster, canceled plans to do so. Simon & Schuster made that decision after Sen. Hawley objected to the certification of electoral votes following the riot inside the U.S. Capitol.<br />Mr. Spence certainly has the right to publish—or decline to publish—whatever he chooses. However, every publishing house, newspaper and magazine has the right to choose what is published under its banner, including a perceived lack of the opportunity to make a profit. This is not restricting anyone’s freedom of speech; it is making a business decision.<br />I suspect he is counting on the fact that controversy is likely to increase sales beyond what the book otherwise would have generated. In this era of self-publishing, it is impossible to prevent a book from being published, and Sen. Hawley could have taken that path. Mr. Spence appears to be seizing this moment, using the notoriety Sen. Hawley has gained, to generate publicity for his own business. That is his right, but let’s not pretend he is doing so to defend Sen. Hawley’s right to free speech.<br />Teri Geske<br />Los Angeles</td>

The current figure includes $2.75 billion in emergency funds Citadel LLC, its partners and Mr. Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management injected into the hedge fund last Monday.<br />As part of the deal, they got noncontrolling revenue shares in Melvin for three years.

People familiar with the hedge fund said its leverage ratio—the value of its assets compared with its capital from investors—was the lowest it has been since Melvin’s 2014 start. They also said the company’s position-level liquidity, or its ability to exit securities in its portfolio easily, had increased significantly.<br />New and existing clients have signed up to invest money into Melvin on Feb. 1, according to the people familiar with the matter.

      <td>President Biden’s pledge to heal and unify seems to mean giving the far left everything it demands in the culture wars. Conservatives therefore must resist. Yet in doing so we must avoid the trap of framing every debate as if it were about religious liberty.<br />Religious liberty is important, but it’s only part of the story. As the Biden administration advances a divisive and extreme social agenda, our response can’t simply be a polite request to be left alone. We need to oppose the left’s agenda on the merits. It’s the principled thing to do, and it will be good politics given where the American people actually are on the issues.<br />Take Mr. Biden’s decision to overturn the Mexico City policy and call for repeal of the Hyde Amendment. Those policies long prevented taxpayers from funding—and thus being complicit in—elective abortions, overseas and at home. But protecting pro-life people’s right to dissent isn’t the most important reason to oppose abortion funding. The complicity matters because killing unborn babies is profoundly unjust. Conservatives’ refusal to fund abortions communicates that message, which is why the left has turned against popular consensus to oppose the Hyde Amendment—including Mr. Biden, who caved to pressure after supporting Hyde for 40 years.<br />Or consider Mr. Biden’s approach to gender ideology: “Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time. There is no room for compromise when it comes to basic human rights.” By his own admission, he’s not looking for common ground—as reflected in his day-one executive order directing that all citizens, including children, be recognized by their declared gender in federal law.<br />Conservatives have no choice but to push back. And here, too, the terrain to defend is not primarily about religious liberty, or religion at all. Children feeling discomfort with their bodies shouldn’t be told the lie that they’re “trapped in the wrong body,” nor should adults pump them full of puberty-blocking drugs and cross-sex hormones. Doing so is unethical medicine, a violation of the bodily integrity of children—whether or not those kids or their parents or doctors are religious.</td>

      <td>To figure out if you’re in a bubble, you need to find the source of the hot air. Obvious for  GameStop ,  but for bitcoin, not so much.<br />In July 2018, we wrote about the cryptocurrency company Tether, which issues tokens called tethers that trade under the symbol USDT and should be valued at $1—making the currency a “stablecoin.” Tether’s creators might have manipulated bitcoin, a University of Texas paper suggests, by issuing tokens willy-nilly unbacked by real dollars and then buying bitcoin to jack up its price. (The company claims the research is flawed.)<br />At the time, Tether’s total value was some $2.7 billion, and its website claimed: “Every tether is always backed 1-to-1 by traditional currency held in our reserves.” So somewhere there should have been $2.7 billion in real money—that’s how a stablecoin is supposed to work. In November 2018, New York state Attorney General Letitia James invoked the Martin Act to begin an investigation into iFinex, which owns Tether and the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange, “in connection with ongoing activities that may have defrauded New York investors.” The company has disputed the attorney general’s claims, denied it misled customers, and said it will fight any action. An appellate court last year rejected its challenge to the probe.<br />Bitcoin peaked at the end of 2017 at $19,000 and over the next year collapsed to $3,200. Well—they’re baaack! On Friday Elon Musk was the latest to pump Bitcoin, which briefly reached almost $38,000. And there are now some $26.4 billion of USDT tokens, $18 billion of which were created since March 2020. Why the increase? No one has a good explanation.<br />All that glitters is not gold. In 2019 Tether subtly updated its claim to say reserves “may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties.” Tether has even admitted it only has 74% of the cash or cash equivalents to back its stablecoin. Hmmm. Basically unbacked.</td>

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.), one of the Republicans who signed the letter, said on “Fox News Sunday” that the proposal amounts to roughly $600 billion in spending. He also said it would match President Biden’s $160 billion allocation for increasing vaccinations and other efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus.<br />The offer is the first Republicans have forwarded since Mr. Biden proposed the $1.9 trillion plan, which Republicans have said is too costly and includes unneeded initiatives, and tests whether the Biden administration and Democrats in Congress will seek compromise or try to pass the relief package themselves. Democratic leaders have said they plan to begin a legislative process that would bypass the need for Republican support this week, with the first step coming as soon as Monday.<br />Brian Deese, Mr. Biden’s top economic adviser, said Sunday the White House is reviewing the Republicans’ letter and is willing to discuss ways to make the relief package more effective.</td>

      <td>Much of the climb in solar stocks looks justified by growth prospects, but buyers may still be in for a bumpy ride</td>
      <td>Solar stocks are sizzling—quite an accomplishment for the simplest and most mature of the green-energy technologies. Finding companies that could keep shining might require looking in less obvious places.<br />The MAC Global Solar Energy Index has generated a 233% return including dividends for dollar investors during the past year. That is well ahead of returns from wind-turbine makers  Vestas  and Siemens Gamesa, nevermind the S&P 500’s 15%.<br />As public and political support for green power has broadened, markets have come to expect a decadeslong renewables rollout. It is hard to see any catalyst for a change in sentiment, says Sam Arie, a veteran utilities analyst at UBS. Solar panels can be the cheapest way to generate electricity in many parts of the world. “In some cases it is even cheaper to build a new solar farm than run existing coal plants,” says Alex Monk, a portfolio manager at asset manager  Schroders .<br />The catch is that the shift to renewables doesn’t guarantee shareholder returns. To justify high valuations, investors need to ensure companies have a defensible business as well as growth prospects.<br />Solar investors have already experienced at least two stomach-churning cycles. A key lesson has been that making panels themselves is a low-margin, hypercompetitive market best avoided. But other parts of the value chain offer better prospects.</td>

      <td>Chief Executive Michelle Gass shares steps she is taking to prevent staff burnout and steer the retailer through the global health crisis</td>
      <td>On March 20,  Kohl’s  CEO Michelle Gass temporarily shut the retail chain’s 1,162 department stores and announced soon after that it would furlough 85,000 of its roughly 100,000 employees. The store closings lasted between seven and 17 weeks, depending on location.<br />At a recent Future of Leadership event hosted by The Wall Street Journal, Ms. Gass discussed how she and her team tried to support staff at all levels of the company during these and other difficult decisions of the past 10 months. They aimed to lead by example to prevent burnout while working remotely and found innovative ways to communicate, she said.<br />A former  Starbucks  executive, Ms. Gass, 52, joined Kohl’s in 2013 as chief merchandising and customer officer and was promoted to the top job five years later. Having worked directly with former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz as his chief strategist during the 2008 recession, Ms. Gass was no stranger to the challenges of navigating a high-profile business, with stores and staff scattered across the country, through periods of uncertainty.<br />Ms. Gass shared her blueprint for ensuring that Kohl’s weathers the global health crisis both financially, and with its company culture and morale intact. Edited excerpts from the conversation:<br />What were your strategies for communicating tough news to your employees in the early days of the pandemic?</td>

      <td>Pandemic has sped the decline of cash payments; analysts say it is too soon to know if new habits will last</td>
      <td>Peter Coffey, an advertising copywriter, has used cash just once since the Covid-19 pandemic started—to buy a used car.<br />When the health crisis began, he set up his smartphone’s tap-to-pay function with a credit card. “Some places weren’t accepting cash. I just got into the habit of never even thinking about cash,” he said.<br />Mr. Coffey, 28 years old, who is working remotely from Tucson, Ariz., said he expects to continue using touchless payment technologies after the pandemic. “It’s great, the amount of times I’ve gone to the store and realized I don’t have my credit card. It’s fine—I just tap with my phone.”<br />He and many other U.S. consumers are shunning cash for a number of reasons, including convenience and a desire to avoid bills and coins as potential sources of coronavirus transmission. In the same way the Covid-19 pandemic has changed the ways we work, shop and socialize, it has also shifted the way many people pay for things.<br />Digital retail sales were up 37% in the third quarter, seasonally adjusted, from the same period a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department. Cash wasn’t an option for those payments: Spending online or using an app like  Uber  Eats requires an electronic method such as a debit card or  PayPal  account.</td>

      <td>Live TV-streaming services have raised their prices but cutting the cord is still cheaper, for the most part, than cable</td>
      <td>’Tis the season for seven-layer dip and serious football. With the Super Bowl kicking off next Sunday, I’ve got two things on the brain—what I’m going to fill this year’s snackadium with, and what’s the cheapest way to stream the game.<br />If you’re wondering the same, there’s good news, at least for the latter. The big game will be streamed free on  CBS Sports.com and on the CBS Sports app for mobile devices and smart TVs. Paying CBS All Access subscribers can watch through the CBS app.<br />Now to figure out how to watch live TV the other 364 days of the year.<br />Cable isn’t cheap.  Comcast ’s  entry-level TV-only plan is advertised at $50, but after the first year, that price bumps up to $60 a month. And that sticker price doesn’t include fees such as the $13.50-a-month location-dependent “broadcast surcharge” or any installation and activation charges. You can save about $20 a month if you bundle cable and internet service.<br />Cutting the cord isn’t the obvious deal it once was, either. Prices of live-TV streaming services have gone up in recent years. In 2017, at its debut, YouTube TV cost $35 a month; it’s now $65. Sling TV and Hulu with Live TV have also upped their fees. And these live-TV providers are generally separate from the premium streaming services I covered last summer, such as Netflix, HBO Max and  Disney +.</td>

      <td>Amazon.com Inc.  for years has successfully fended off attempts by its U.S. employees to unionize. Now the tech company is preparing for a labor battle unlike anything in its history.<br />In the next two months, thousands of Amazon employees at an Alabama warehouse are set to cast mail-in ballots over whether to organize into a union, a vote that could reshape the relationship between workers and the nation’s second-largest employer.<br />The commerce giant faces a familiar opponent: the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, or RWDSU, which along with local organizers is helping to lead the pro-union campaign. The union has helped organize thousands of poultry workers in Alabama, a right-to-work state, and has become a frequent Amazon antagonist in recent years. The RWDSU fought the company’s plans for a second headquarters in New York in late 2018 and supported worker protests at some warehouses during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />So far, the current effort has had more success than other attempts to organize Amazon workers, according to labor experts. They note that a successful union push at the warehouse could spur similar actions at Amazon’s more than 800 facilities in the U.S.<br />“Amazon has seen their demand skyrocket” during the pandemic, said Arthur Wheaton, director of Western NY Labor and Environmental Programs for the Worker Institute at Cornell University. The company’s continued growth will bring increasing scrutiny over how it pays and treats its employees, he said.</td>

      <td>The Girl Scouts perceived a grave threat from the Boy Scouts and tried to steer parents away from coed programs, documents show</td>
      <td>In May 2017, ahead of a meeting of the Boy Scouts of America’s top leaders, a Girl Scouts of the USA employee emailed a counterpart at the Boy Scouts to ask about speculation it was considering admitting girls into the historically boys-only programs.<br />For worried Girl Scouts executives, the reply was heartening. The Boy Scouts were discussing how to make their programs more accessible to families, but the organization still valued single-gender programs and wanted to “avoid any confusion that there may be consideration of coed scouting,” a Boy Scouts executive said in reply to the inquiry. The chief executives of both youth groups also spoke by phone, and the Girl Scouts came away reassured, according to internal emails released through litigation last month.<br />Even before these exchanges, the Boy Scouts were running focus groups on how to appeal to girls, reviewing market analytics and forming a team to consider possible retaliation from the Girl Scouts in the event the organizations turned against each other, according to internal emails filed in federal court. At the time, Boy Scouts executives were debating the merits of raiding the Girl Scouts’ youngest members for recruits, court filings show.<br />“Be aggressive, move faster and give a lot of serious thought to Girl Scout actions and be prepared to take them out,” one unnamed Boy Scouts executive wrote in a May 2017 message. The Girl Scouts would be upset, the executive wrote, but added, “We will prevail!”<br />The push within the Boy Scouts to recruit girls came as it faced an increasing threat of legal exposure over past failures to protect boys from sexual predators in the volunteer ranks. Lawsuits from abuse survivors were piling up, and states including New York, California and New Jersey were moving closer to suspending statutes of limitations on abuse claims, allowing victims to sue institutions like the Boy Scouts regardless of when the alleged misconduct occurred. The Boy Scouts have said the organization believes victims and is “deeply sorry for the abuse suffered because perpetrators used our program to harm innocent children.”</td>

      <td>Investors see some classic signs of froth, but they are uncertain whether a downfall looms</td>
      <td>For once, everyone seems to agree: Much of the market looks like it’s in a bubble.<br />Shares of unprofitable companies like  GameStop Corp .  and  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc .  are rising at a breakneck pace, propelled by a growing army of individual investors. Options activity is surging, bitcoin prices are near records and businesses are rushing to opportunistically sell stock through a flurry of initial public offerings, listings of blank-check companies and follow-on share sales.<br />To many, valuations look stretched as they hover at levels similar to the highflying days of 2000. That said, high valuations alone don’t necessarily mean the rally is near its end, investors say. History has shown that markets have often been able to climb far longer than thought possible, be it the dot-com boom in the late 1990s or the dizzying rise in Japanese stocks in the 1980s.<br />And recently, the broader stock market has been on the decline. The S&P 500 dropped 3.3% last week, though it remains up 66% from its March low. The bubblelike behavior there has mostly been contained to a handful of individual stocks, not larger indexes.<br />An even bigger issue arguing against a marketwide bubble is simple math. With interest rates at rock bottom and further stimulus on the table, many investors are being handsomely rewarded by putting their money into riskier, higher-yielding assets. What’s more, in many cases earnings have held up or been robust, despite a global pandemic.</td>

In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this month that state officials expect 30% of health-care workers offered the vaccine will ultimately turn it down. Two-thirds of the staff at a Florida hospital refused the vaccine this month, leaving so many unused doses that the facility started giving away shots to the general public.<br />The hesitancy among health-care workers concerns public-health officials who expected America’s front-line workers to serve as a model for others.<br />“Please get vaccinated,” Anthony Fauci, who is serving as President Biden’s chief medical adviser for the Covid-19 pandemic, said in a video message to health-care providers. “It’s important to protect yourselves, to protect your family, but as important, symbolically, as health-care providers, to show confidence in the vaccine so that other people in this country follow suit.”<br />In a survey of 1,563 respondents conducted in January by researchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation, 79% of U.S. adults who haven’t yet been vaccinated say they would be likely to turn to a doctor, nurse or other health-care provider when deciding whether to get a vaccination.</td>

Previous installments from the series are here.<br />Sally Grimes landed her dream job last year when she became Clif Bar & Co.’s CEO. Taking the helm in the midst of a global pandemic tested this seasoned food-industry executive.<br />When she arrived at the company in June, her employees were already weary of juggling child care from home while trying to keep factories free of any coronavirus outbreaks. She also had to confront soft demand for snack bars—the pandemic curtailed visits to convenience stores, airports and other places where people typically purchase Clif’s products—as well as heightened competition from rivals.<br />“Early on in my career, I had the feeling that I had to be the smartest person in the room coming out of business school and that led to some mistakes,” she said. Since then, she said she learned a key lesson: “Humility is not the opposite of confidence. It’s the freedom for learning.”<br />The CEO grew up outside of Chicago. Her interest in brand management and the food industry began while she was a student at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business in the late 1990s. A lecture from a Kraft Foods executive piqued her interest, and she went on to get a job there. She was on the Kraft team that came out with Easy Mac, the first microwavable macaroni-and-cheese cups.</td>

And both risk taking this basically sound logic to extremes.<br />The rally in everything from big tech stocks to  Tesla Inc.  to bitcoin are all manifestations of what Wall Street calls “TINA” for “there is no alternative”: when bank deposits pay nothing and government bonds next to nothing, investors will grasp at almost anything in search of a return.<br />Directionally, this is not wrong. The value of an asset is its future income, discounted to the present using interest rates, plus a “risk premium”—the extra return you expect for owning something riskier than a government bond. A declining interest rate or risk premium boosts the present value of that future income.<br />This can certainly justify some of the market’s rally. The ratio of the S&P 500 to expected earnings has jumped from 18 in 2019 to 22 now, lowering the inverse of that ratio, the “earnings yield,” from about 5.5% to 4.6%. That happens to closely track the decline in the 10-year Treasury yield from 1.9% to around 1%. Low rates also help explain the outperformance of big growth companies like  Apple Inc.  and  Amazon.com Inc.,  for whom the bulk of profits lie far in the future.<br />Has this gone too far? In a blog post Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, worked out the intrinsic value of the S&P 500 assuming bond yields at 2% over the long run and an equity risk premium of 5%. The result: The S&P on Friday was roughly 11% overvalued.</td>

Normally, manufacturers would raise production to meet such demand. But doing business during the pandemic remains challenging, companies said during recent quarterly updates.<br />Many manufacturers continue to suffer from inventory shortages, a remnant from when plants were closed last spring. In addition, measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19, such as adding space between workers, are weighing on production. As a result, manufacturing backlogs hit a two-and-a-half year high in December, according to the Institute for Supply Management.<br />Slowdowns are compounding along supply chains, from ports to warehouses to factory floors, leading to higher costs. “You are seeing logistic costs going up, trucking costs going up, airfreight going up,” 3M Co. Chief Executive Mike Roman said in an interview.<br />Whirlpool said Wednesday that adding space between workers had slowed appliance output. Chief Executive Marc Bitzer said Whirlpool’s suppliers were experiencing the same drag. The company said some appliances would be in short supply until at least halfway through 2021.</td>

      <td>Hundreds of hours of work went into this season’s boldest fashions. WSJ. picks the top looks from the Spring 2021 couture shows.</td>
      <td>The spring 2021 couture season came to a close this Thursday, and though we’re still sequestered at home viewing the collections on screens, there was plenty to be inspired by. For his Valentino couture collection, Pierpaolo Piccioli created pared-back, even cozy-looking options for spring, in striking contrast to the epically proportioned, floating white gowns the label showed last season. He incorporated what some might consider loungewear, though the element of couture was not lost on a single stitch. One look features a yellow turtleneck finished with the ateliers signature budellini embroidery and a beige cashmere coat intricately woven with Lurex fringe. Sterling Ruby, too, focused on knitwear for his S.R. Studio. LA. CA. collection. A pair of denim trousers printed with images of the engines of American hot-rods was paired with a braided handknit sweater that felt suitable even for staying at home. Other collections had us dreaming of things we’ve had to put on hold this past year. At Chanel, Virginie Viard created a make-believe wedding day complete with a satin bridal gown as the finale. For her  Christian Dior  haute couture collection, Maria Grazia Chiuri upheld a sense of escapism with a collection inspired by tarot arts. A standout look with a striking gold brocade cloak was called the High Priestess, a tarot symbol of stillness and reflection. Valentino and Fendi both sprinkled men’s looks into their couture collections this year, marking a shift to gender neutrality that has been bubbling up from the ready-to-wear runways. Though these collections won’t reach anyone’s wardrobe until late spring, their debut brings a sense of optimism and opportunity to the start of the year. Below, we’ve chosen our 14 favorite looks from the season.<br />A lace mesh gown glistens with 180,000 silver pearls.<br />Mink slippers embroidered with glass pearls complete a taffeta marbled suit.<br />A relaxed ensemble is electrified with Lurex fringe outerwear.<br />A men’s look celebrates the understated side of couture.</td>

      <td>U.S. is catching up but most countries are way behind; Britain alerted world to new variant</td>
      <td>LONDON—Every week across the U.K., a fleet of courier trucks ferries chilled waste material from half a million Covid-19 tests to a genome-sequencing facility in Cambridgeshire, eastern England.<br />The daily operation is part of a Covid-19 surveillance system that has made the U.K. the world’s leading sequencer of the coronavirus genome and helped it to spot a more contagious, and possibly more deadly, variant of the virus that in most countries would have long gone unnoticed.<br />Viral sequencing—producing a kind of bar code for the virus—has in recent months emerged as crucial in the global hunt for versions of the pathogen that are better adapted to infect humans, evade vaccines and possibly to kill. Virus variants first identified in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil have provoked concern among experts.<br />The variant the sequencers uncovered in the U.K., which is now the dominant variety in the country, has a mutation that appears better able to bind onto human cells. Studies suggest it is 50% more transmissible than the previous prevalent variant while other research suggests it could be at least 30% more deadly.<br />New viral variants are more likely to be spotted in the U.K. than anywhere else. As of Jan. 29, the U.K. had submitted 44%, or around 190,000, of the genomes held in a global library run by the nonprofit Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, or Gisaid. That is around 5.1% of the nearly four million cases detected in the U.K.</td>

To win the IMF’s acquiescence, he’ll narrow a yawning budget gap, he said in an interview on Friday.<br />It is the traditional path that Argentina, which has defaulted nine times on sovereign debt, has taken when its economy has hit rock bottom, as it has now during a punishing pandemic that led to a 10% economic contraction 2020. But Mr. Guzmán said his plan falls short of the draconian austerity measures the IMF imposed with other governments.<br />“We are using the negotiations with the IMF as an opportunity to try to break with the patterns of the past,” said Mr. Guzmán, a Columbia University-trained economist.<br />The twist this time around is that Mr. Guzmán and President Alberto Fernández both belong to a party that has long railed against the IMF, blaming it for Argentina’s problems. And they face a formidable opponent within the governing Peronist coalition that is marshaling lawmakers against the IMF’s belt-tightening policies.<br />Vice President Cristina Kirchner, leader of a far-left faction, calls for strong state intervention and public spending to preserve the purchasing power of Argentine workers, a policy that marked her two terms as president.</td>

      <td>The progressive press decides that dissenters should be suppressed.</td>
      <td>Most Americans learn in school about flagship political excesses in U.S. history like Joe McCarthy’s 1950s inquisitions, the post-World War I Red Scare and the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. Yet a recent Washington Post opinion piece purports to explain “what the 1798 Sedition Act got right.”<br />The law banned a wide range of political speech and publication. It was passed by the ruling Federalists to suppress the rival Democratic-Republicans, whom they saw as seditious. The Post piece argues that though their solution was “flawed,” the Federalists had reason to worry about “unregulated freedom of the press.”<br />We highlight this as one example among many of the emerging appetite for viewpoint suppression among journalists, intellectuals and Democrats in the wake of the Trump Presidency. They increasingly see domestic enemies wherever they look, and are devising ways to use levers of power to restrict, regulate and boycott opposition. It’s an extraordinary and ominous turn in a democracy.<br />Many calls to sanction opposition media come from voices that claimed to be most alarmed by Donald Trump’s attacks on the free press. Margaret Sullivan, the Post’s media columnist, wrote this week that “corporations that advertise on Fox News should walk away,” declaring that the outlet’s “role in the 400,000 U.S. lives lost to the pandemic and in the disastrous attack of Jan. 6” has been “deadly.”<br />Nicholas Kristof of the  New York Times  called for “pressure on advertisers to withdraw from Fox News so long as it functions as an extremist madrasa.” He added that “cable providers should be asked why they distribute channels that peddle lies.” A CNN writer asserted that providers like  Comcast  “have escaped scrutiny and entirely dodged this conversation.” By conversation he means political bullying from the left.</td>

      <td>The Biden team shows no gratitude to the man who sped up the Covid shots.</td>
      <td>Johnson & Johnson  and  Novavax  this week reported that their vaccines were effective in clinical trials, and what fortunate timing. The U.S. urgently needs a supply boost. But at this juncture it’s also worth noting how former Operation Warp Speed chief Moncef Slaoui positioned the Biden Administration for a vaccine triumph.<br />One of Mr. Slaoui’s inspired ideas was to diversify the federal government’s vaccine bets with six manufacturers when nobody knew which, if any, would work. The vaccine candidates used different technologies—Moderna and  Pfizer -BioNTech (mRNA), J&J and  AstraZeneca  (adenovirus), and Novavax and  Sanofi -GSK (recombinant protein).<br />The J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines were hobbled by trial delays in the fall. But J&J reported Friday that its vaccine was 66% effective at protecting people from moderate to severe disease in a global trial, and 85% against severe illness. Early trial data from AstraZeneca suggests similar efficacy. Novavax reported Thursday its shot appears to be nearly 90% effective.<br />The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are about 95% effective, so it’s fortuitous that their trial results came first so their shots could inoculate the elderly and others most at highest risk. But even if somewhat less effective, the other vaccines may be good candidates for young people and boost supply this spring.<br />Operation Warp Speed removed the financial risk for drug makers by financing trials and manufacturing in advance so vaccines could roll out as soon as they are approved. This is the reason some 20 million Americans have already been inoculated. President Biden this week ordered another 200 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna to be delivered this summer.</td>

      <td>Beijing retaliates after Britain offers refuge from growing tyranny.</td>
      <td>To its eternal credit, the British government is honoring its promise to its former colonial subjects by offering a path to citizenship for Hong Kongers who hold British National (Overseas) passports and their family members. The need for such refuge became clearer on Friday as China retaliated by announcing that China will no longer recognize BN(O) passports as a valid form of identification or travel documentation.<br />For now Hong Kongers who want to leave can still use their Hong Kong passports unless there’s a warrant out for their arrest or bail restrictions. But Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian warned that China “reserves the right to take further measures.”<br />Hong Kongers fear Beijing could soon impose restrictions on the movement of money or assets. At the request of police, HSBC froze the bank accounts of pro-democracy lawmaker Ted Hui, who escaped abroad in December. Pro-Beijing lawmaker Regina Ip recently suggested that China should consider using “its nationality law to disallow dual nationality,” so Hong Kongers who flee may never be able to return. China could also restrict Hong Kong refugees’ freedom of movement by pressuring other countries to refuse to recognize BN(O) passports.<br />Meanwhile, the atmosphere in Hong Kong grows more stifling by the day. Earlier this month Hong Kong police arrested more than 50 former lawmakers and dissenters. Pro-democracy district councilors and lawyers are likely the next targets. Pro-Beijing lawmakers have also called for schools to install surveillance cameras in classrooms to ensure teachers aren’t making “subversive remarks” during lessons.<br />The message is clear: Hong Kong may become a place you can’t escape. So it’s a shame that last month Sen. Ted Cruz blocked legislation that would have made it easier for Hong Kongers to gain refugee or temporary protected status in the U.S. The Biden Administration has a chance to do better by the cause of freedom by following Britain’s excellent example.</td>

      <td>A FISA judge gives a former FBI agent a slap on the wrist.</td>
      <td>How can the American people take the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court seriously when it doesn’t do so itself? That’s our view of Friday’s sentencing of former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith, who admitted to falsifying evidence submitted to the court for a warrant to spy on onetime Trump foreign-policy adviser Carter Page.<br />Federal Judge James Boasberg spared Mr. Clinesmith prison in favor of 12 months probation and 400 hours of community service. The judge said the evidence persuaded him that “Mr. Clinesmith likely believed that what he said about Mr. Page was true.”<br />In their brief, prosecutors made clear how unlikely this is. The evidence of Mr. Clinesmith’s animus toward Donald Trump is considerable. As for being an honest mistake, remember that Mr. Clinesmith changed an email confirming Mr. Page had been a CIA source to one that said the exact opposite, explicitly adding the words “not a source” before he forwarded it.<br />In their brief arguing for prison time, prosecutors contended that Mr. Clinesmith’s behavior “struck at the very core” of the candor the FISA court “fundamentally relies on” and “allowed the FBI to conduct surveillance on a U.S. citizen based on a FISA application that the Department of Justice later acknowledged lacked probable cause.” Prison time for Mr. Clinesmith, they said, was also necessary to “deter others from committing similar crimes.”<br />Friday’s sentencing will fuel cynicism about two-tiered justice. While George Papadopoulos served time in prison for making false statements to the FBI, and a federal judge refused to drop charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn after the Justice Department said they had no basis, a top law enforcement official who abused his police powers while operating in secrecy escapes with probation.</td>

      <td>Players weren’t ‘investors’ and they didn’t invent a new road to prosperity and wealth creation.</td>
      <td>If little-informed members of the public can be egged on by social media to storm the Capitol, why can’t they be egged on to storm  GameStop  stock? They can be and were. The mistake, which will nevertheless be made, is treating an episode unique and singular in many respects as heralding a trend.<br />News is “man bites dog.” What often follows is a deluge of “analysis” about how men biting dogs is our new normal.<br />Happily, the bizarre market phenomenon that engulfed a few stocks like GameStop this week, and that resumed on Friday, is not likely to become any kind of new normal. Many episodes that command our attention tend to be self-correcting. The Capitol Hill stormers left a trail of selfies and social-media posts to help with their arrest. Though promoters of the GameStop bubble probably won’t land in jail, many are certain to end up losing their giant paper gains. Day traders might be able to drive GameStop shares temporarily from $20 to $483. They can’t make GameStop a $483 company.<br />The rebels behind this latest social-media phenomenon, unlike those who invaded Capitol Hill, seem to lack any cause at all. When asked what they are against, they’ve basically responded, “Whaddya got?” Answer: short sellers.<br />Usually seen as Wall Street’s sanitation engineers, shorts play a useful role in countering the market’s mechanical bias toward bullishness. In betting against the shares of videogame retailer GameStop and a few other troubled smallish companies, they did nothing to invite the hostility of the online hordes that decided to make their lives difficult. On the contrary, by taking their short positions, they actually gave long-term bulls a way to earn extra money by lending their own shares to assist the trades the shorts wanted to make. Many bulls likely have short positions themselves to hedge their long positions in companies like GameStop and the movie theater chain AMC.</td>

      <td>A plan to extend I-49 through a historically black neighborhood has divided Shreveport, La.</td>
      <td>Fights over whether to build freeways through city neighborhoods may seem like a thing of the past. It has been 65 years since Jane Jacobs successfully rallied opposition to Robert Moses’s plans for a highway through Manhattan’s Washington Square Park and 60 years since the Chrysler Freeway sliced through Detroit. But a version of this old fight is dividing Shreveport, La.<br />At issue is an $800 million plan to extend a 3-mile stretch of Interstate 49 through the historic African-American neighborhood of Allendale, where a few old shotgun houses, once synonymous with black poverty, still stand. The neighborhood is still poor. Fifty-four homes, some of them new, owner-occupied  structures built by a national nonprofit, and three historic black church buildings stand in the path of the proposed extension. A bipartisan coalition of local, state and federal representatives have joined forces with the Shreveport business community to target the properties for seizure via the government’s eminent-domain authority.<br />“The freeway would cause many of the newly built homes to be destroyed,” says Sharpel Welch of the nonprofit Shreveport-Bossier Community Renewal. “That’s years of revitalization down the drain.” Along with her husband, Emmitt, Ms. Welch runs a “friendship house” in Allendale, where they tutor and mentor neighborhood kids from streets where new homes sprout amid vacant lots. “It’s a David-and-Goliath situation,” she says, “but our neighbors are willing to fight.”<br />Once a regional center of the oil industry, Shreveport is the rare Sunbelt city that has been losing population—down 9% from its peak of 205,000 in 1980. Allendale is emblematic of the decline. Once a prosperous black enclave with 25,000 residents, it’s down to 6,000. “We are hemorrhaging population,” says Tim Magner of the Shreveport Chamber of Commerce. “We’re a city on the bubble, and we have to reinvent ourselves.”<br />Allendale is caught up in competing visions of how to bounce back. It’s a debate that pits a local urbanist architect allied with neighborhood families against the city’s business community. For the Chamber of Commerce and others involved in economic development, Shreveport’s best shot at revival is as a regional distribution center. I-49 stops at the north end of the city, and truck traffic must follow a slow-moving loop connector route, including local roads, to re-enter the highway south of town. Mr. Manger says the new road would link Shreveport directly to New Orleans, with its international container port, as well as to Dallas and the East Coast via I-20.</td>

Twitter Inc.  banned Mr. Trump’s personal account in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, citing the risk of further incitement of violence.  Facebook Inc.  announced a temporary suspension of Mr. Trump after the riot before extending that action indefinitely.<br />“All those who allowed President Trump to succeed waited until they were entirely sure that he had no power left to then wrap themselves in dignity and now say ‘Let’s take away his whistle,’” Mr. Macron said. “Why didn’t they shut down his accounts before all this happened?”<br />Mr. Macron said governments had delegated too much authority to tech companies by expecting them to act as stewards for Western democracy. “This is an issue for real international regulation,” Mr. Macron said.</td>

      <td>Arnold Schoenberg’s ‘Pierrot Lunaire’ (‘Moonstruck Pierre’) so defied the melodic conventions of classical music that its premiere ended in violence.</td>
      <td><br /><br />The 1912 chamber piece “Pierrot Lunaire” (“Moonstruck Pierrot”) is a musical treasure—fascinating, enchanting in its range of instrumental colors, and deeply influential to all who came after. Yet its composer, Arnold Schoenberg (1874-1951), was for many simply the man who took a wrecking ball to centuries of musical tradition through his embrace of atonality. Much of his output engendered alarm and outright hostility. “Only a psychiatrist can help poor Schoenberg now,” wrote composer Richard Strauss to Alma Mahler in 1913. “He would do better to shovel snow instead of scribbling on music paper.”<br />Such reactions began even before the composer’s most radical departures from convention. Schoenberg’s string sextet “Transfigured Night” (1899), written when he was just 25 and now recognized as a Romantic cornerstone, was excoriated: “It sounds as if someone had smeared the score of [Wagner’s] ‘Tristan’ while it was still wet,” remarked a contemporary. A musical society in Vienna refused to allow the work to be performed because it contained one dissonant chord still unclassified at that time by any textbook (an inverted ninth, tame by today’s standards). Over the years, the complaints proliferated: At a 1913 concert conducted by Schoenberg in the Great Hall of Vienna’s Musikverein, the reaction to both the composer and his closest students, Alban Berg and Anton Webern, was even more violent than the one attending the infamous premiere of Igor Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” in Paris that same year.<br />Yet, Stravinsky, the composer most often regarded as Schoenberg’s rival for the affections of the cultivated music world, came to the late realization that Schoenberg had written “a body of works we now recognize as the epicenter of the development of our musical language.” Discussing Schoenberg’s “Pierrot Lunaire,” which had its premiere at the Berlin Choralion-Saal on Oct. 16, 1912, following 40 rehearsals, Stravinsky called it “the solar plexus as well as the mind of early 20th-century music.” The music, he admitted, 50 years after the work’s debut, initially had been “beyond me, as it was beyond all of us at that time.” At one performance “Pierrot” prompted an audience member to point at the composer and yell, “Shoot him! Shoot him!”</td>

      <td>Chevron’s careful strategy has helped it stay off radars of activist investors and regulators</td>
      <td>In a sector facing uncomfortable questions about the future, it helps to stay out of the spotlight.  Chevron  certainly managed to do that as its competitor  Exxon  Mobil faces scrutiny from activist investors and securities regulators.<br />Chevron took large write-downs earlier on in the pandemic, in line with European peers, potentially helping it stay out of asset valuation questions Exxon is facing. And while activist investors are pressuring Exxon to work on both environmental and growth sustainability, Chevron noted on Friday’s earnings call that it hasn’t faced similar pressures, noting that its investors prefer energy-transition investments that don’t erode returns.<br />Still, Chevron’s fourth-quarter results showed how far both U.S. energy giants are from recovery. For the full year, Chevron recorded a net loss of $5.5 billion, by far its worst performance in three decades and only the second time during that span that it posted an annual loss. For the quarter, the company’s revenue met Wall Street expectations, but one-off items spurred a surprise loss of $665 million.<br />There were still things to like. Chevron has been differentiating itself from Exxon through a more conservative strategy, keeping a lid on capital expenditures well before the pandemic hit. Operating cash flow, for example, was higher than analyst expectations, and its net debt ratio was 23%, even after having taken on borrowings associated with its acquisition of Noble Energy last year—well within its target range.<br />Strong fundamentals might be why Chevron has dodged the scrutiny that Exxon is facing regarding its steadily rising dividend. Both supermajors have stuck to promises to grow dividends; the difference is that Chevron can sustain it more easily. Dividends are eroding Chevron’s cash position at a much slower rate: For the full year, free cash flow minus dividends was negative $8 billion; Exxon burned through more in just the second quarter of 2020.</td>

My version usually starts with bourbon (though a rye-based Manhattan is also a thing of beauty) and ends with a Luxardo cherry or three. That bourbon-soaked gift at the bottom of the glass is a delicious reminder that the world hasn’t completely fallen apart, and neither have I.<br />Just the ritual of making a cocktail helps glue me back together.

He’s been threatened, vilified and abused on a nationwide scale,” the judge added.<br />Mr. Clinesmith addressed the court, expressing deep remorse for his actions and taking responsibility for what he described as a “critical error in judgment.” He’s the only person charged in Justice Department special counsel John Durham’s investigation into surveillance of Trump campaign associates during the 2016 election.<br />“I let the FBI, the Department of Justice, my colleagues, the public and my family down. I also let myself down. I will live with the consequences of my action as well as the deeply held feelings of regret, shame and loss caused by it for the rest of my life,” he said.</td>

      <td>Tech companies think the statute allows them to censor with impunity. The law is seldom so simple.</td>
      <td>Section numbers of federal statutes rarely stir the soul, but one of them, 230, stirs up much fear, for it has seemed to justify censorship. Relying on it, tech companies including Google and  Twitter  increasingly pull the plug on disfavored posts, websites and even people. Online moderation can be valuable, but this censorship is different. It harms Americans’ livelihoods, muzzles them in the increasingly electronic public square, distorts political and cultural conversations, influences elections, and limits our freedom to sort out the truth for ourselves.<br />But does the 1996 Communications Decency Act really justify Big Tech censorship? The key language, Section 230(c)(2), provides: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of . . . any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.” The companies take this as a license to censor with impunity.<br />That understanding is questionable. Law is rarely as clear-cut as a binary switch. To be sure, courts emphasize the breadth of Section 230’s immunity for website operators. But there is little if any federal appellate precedent upholding censorship by the big tech companies. The question therefore comes down to the statute itself. The answers should give pause to the companies and courage to those they’ve censored.<br />The fundamental problems are constitutional—the first concerning the Commerce Clause. Congress’s authority to enact Section 230 may seem indisputable because the Supreme Court has, since the New Deal, adopted an almost open-ended view of Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce. Yet congressionally emboldened censorship poses unique questions.<br />Originally, the Constitution’s broadest protection for free expression lay in Congress’s limited power. James Wilson reassured Americans in 1787—four years before the First Amendment’s ratification—that “a power similar to that which has been granted for the regulation of commerce” was not “granted to regulate literary publications,” and thus “the proposed system possesses no influence whatever upon the press.”</td>

      <td>The great black novelist wrote about whites, but white novelists of his day didn’t return the favor.</td>
      <td>I was ready to take a punch for James Baldwin. It was spring of 1992, and my one-man play about Baldwin, written at the request of the late actor Reggie Montgomery, had just been given a rehearsed reading at New York’s Lincoln Center. Most of the invited audience appeared enthusiastic, but in the foyer a naysayer approached me. Michael Thelwell, then a professor of African-American studies at Amherst College, told me many things about what he had just seen, the most polite being “Keep out.”<br />Mr. Thelwell and I had already had a discussion on the subject of a nonblack writer presuming to trespass on protected territory. The year before, when I spoke at Amherst on my biography of Baldwin, “Talking at the Gates,” Mr. Thelwell sat in the front row, harrumphing and fidgeting. In a preface to his verbal assault on me, he suggested that I, a Scotsman, would feel offended if he, a Jamaican, were to write about Celtic art and literature. He didn’t use the term “cultural appropriation” (though it was in use by that time, notably by Ralph Ellison, speaking in its favor), but that’s what was on his mind.<br />I might have felt flattered. Mr. Thelwell was among the contributors to a collection of essays published in 1968, “William Styron’s ‘Nat Turner’: Ten Black Writers Respond.” All 10 opposed Styron’s novel about a renegade slave in the state of Virginia in 1831. Mr. Thelwell’s essay is one of the most eloquent, and I had singled it out for praise in my biography.<br />Baldwin was not among the 10. His position was in direct conflict with theirs. “The Confessions of Nat Turner” is written in the first person of the black rebel leader. “He has begun the common history,” Baldwin said of Styron. “Ours.” Baldwin was not at the time in favor with the majority of black intellectuals. His homosexuality and his habit of mixing in white society were, in their eyes, marks against him.<br />Baldwin never changed his mind about what Styron had done, despite increasing disillusionment with white liberal opinion in the 1960s. Three years before his death in 1987, he said what he had been saying for years: “The conundrum of color is the inheritance of every American.” He was not talking directly about literature, but he then turned his attention to it: “The effort on the part of the Republic to avoid the presence of black people reflects itself in American literature fatally, to the detriment of that literature.” It is a less rhetorical but more subtle restatement of his support for Styron. Where were the white novelists of their generation who had chosen to follow the example of “The Confessions of Nat Turner”?</td>

      <td>Approval is unlikely to quell growing political furor over the shot’s effectiveness, production problems and availability</td>
      <td>The European Union’s drug regulator recommended use of a Covid-19 vaccine from  AstraZeneca  PLC, but the approval is unlikely to quell growing political furor over its effectiveness, production problems and availability.<br />Friday’s announcement from the European Medicines Agency, endorsing the vaccine’s use in people 18 and older, advances a shot that EU officials have considered critical in turning the tide of the pandemic in the region. But an EMA warning the shot hasn’t been sufficiently tested in people over 55 adds to manufacturing woes dogging the project and prompted fresh attacks.<br />Some Europeans—even high officials—have interpreted the lack of data  as meaning the vaccine isn’t effective.<br />“The real problem with AstraZeneca is that it hasn’t worked the way we expected. Because we’ve had very little information,” said French President Emmanuel Macron shortly before the EMA announcement. So far, he said, “everything seems to indicate that it’s quasi ineffective for people older than 65 years old, some say 60 years and above.”<br />Mr. Macron didn’t indicate how he drew that conclusion, and there is no publicly released data to support that.</td>

      <td>A welcome escape from the digital world, those things in your mailbox sell some great stuff—if you know how to shop them. Here, a stylish guide to buying catalog clothes.</td>
      <td>HOW MANY screens are in your bedroom-turned-office? We’re bombarded by blue light from our laptops and phones as we scroll through emails, Slack chats, Instagram,  Twitter  or whatever e-comm site that creepily tailored-to-you pop-up ad recommends. Sure, you could get up and take a walk, but here’s a less expected antidote to digital overload: Thumb through the catalogs that clog your (actual) mailbox.<br />Alex Carleton, outdoor brand Filson’s chief creative officer, suggested that Covid has left us craving the pleasures of simpler times. “We are physically disconnected…[but] you have an emotional connection to the physical quality of the mail coming into your home,” he said. Filson’s catalog, which has been shipped to subscribers for over 100 years, reads like a magazine packed with escapist photos, profiles of history’s greatest mountain men and stuff you’d actually want to wear. Along with mailers from earthy California label Jenni Kayne and better-basics disrupter Ayr, Filson is one of many brands rehabilitating catalogs’ reputation for being fusty, outdated and woefully cheesy.<br />Catalogs have “a chronological order, a beginning and an end…and that seems to be hard-wired into us still,” said Guillermo Sanchez, CEO of Publitas, a company that helps brands bring their catalogs online. That finite, predictable, quiet quality is comforting in a hectic digital age.<br />Here, a brief guide to catalog shopping, the best buys, and all the analog pleasures this throwback diversion brings.<br />From the late 1800s, when Sears, Roebuck and Co. started the catalog craze, through the 1990s, when now-bankrupt J.Crew was the preppy catalog king, these mailers were a key tool for connecting with customers. The internet, of course, has since largely taken their place. That said, the affordable, comfortable, function-first clothes from traditional catalog brands like Lands' End and L.L. Bean are resonating in the Covid era. “Our precious clothes aren’t coming out right now,” said New York fashion consultant Josh Peskowitz. He argues that today’s clothing purchases need to tick at least one of two boxes: “Is it soft and comfy for me to sit cross-legged on my couch for the next 14 hours, or can I wipe my hands on it?” So whether you’re cozying up in your home office or you’ve traded your city apartment for a higher-maintenance country abode (that gutter won’t clean itself), you can rely on catalog brands for appropriate clothes. New York City high-school math teacher Eric Scott, 39, applauds the quality of the Lands’ End Donegal tweed trousers he’s been wearing while Zoom schooling. “You’ll have this pair of pants for 15 years,” he said. “You don’t have to worry about them fraying at the bottom or the dye wearing thin.”</td>
