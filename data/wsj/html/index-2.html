      <td>Democrats in politics and the press agree to pretend the economy is a disaster.</td>
      <td>If readers think this week’s adoring press coverage of President Joe Biden is excessive, they should just wait until next year. Media folk are so eager to prepare for a “Biden recovery” narrative in the future that they are making outlandish claims about the present.<br />This column has previously noted the legion of gloom the president is leading alongside former rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (Socialist, Vt.) to attempt to justify massive federal interventions. Mr. Sanders enjoys making ridiculous comparisons between today’s economy and the Great Depression.<br />Reporters are also eligible to enlist in the legion. “Biden inherits the worst job market of any modern president,” says a Washington Post headline. Postie Eli Rosenberg writes:<br />Sounds like a dire situation indeed, but perhaps less so when one realizes that the unemployment rate was higher during most of the Obama-Biden administration. Around the end of the fifth long year of Mr. Biden’s tenure as vice president, which included his leading role in implementing White House economic “stimulus” programs, the unemployment rate finally fell to that magic number of 6.7%. Unfortunately, during the two Obama-Biden terms the unemployment rate never got close to the Trump-era low of 3.5%, which American workers were enjoying in the pre-Covid days of February 2020.<br />It should also be noted that while misguided virus responses from state and local governments have indeed resulted in 10 million fewer people with jobs than in early 2020, the shutdowns actually killed more than 22 million jobs at their nadir. Since then the rapid recovery of most of the jobs killed by the lockdown is strong evidence that the economy is ready to roar if Mr. Biden’s Democratic colleagues in state government will allow it.</td>

      <td>Former Neiman Marcus owners have sold a stake in the online retailer at a high valuation, but its business model may need a makeover</td>
      <td>Online luxury-fashion retailer Mytheresa, which used to be owned by struggling department store Neiman Marcus, has fetched a high price at its market debut. Although the business seems to tick all the right boxes for investors, not all trends are in its favor.<br />This week, around one-fifth of Mytheresa’s parent company,  MYT Netherlands ,  was sold to investors at a $2.2 billion valuation. Appetite for fashion e-commerce businesses is strong among investors. One week after its initial public offering, Poshmark’s shares are trading about 66% above where they initially priced.<br />Mytheresa shares started trading Thursday at $35.85, and ended their first day at $31, up 19% from the offering price on the New York Stock Exchange.<br />It is a great result for Mytheresa’s owners, private-equity firm Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, after a messy legal spat and Neiman Marcus’s bankruptcy. The department store’s bondholders sued the duo for changing Mytheresa’s place in the failing retailer’s corporate structure in a way that put it out of reach of creditors.<br />Proceeds from the sale will ultimately be used to settle debt the parent company owes as part of the bankruptcy settlement. Although the loans don’t mature until 2025, they carry an expensive 7.5% coupon so it makes sense to retire them early.</td>

      <td>Social-media giant says decision from independent panel would be binding, can’t be overruled by CEO Mark Zuckerberg</td>
      <td>Facebook Inc.  has referred its decision to indefinitely suspend the accounts of former President Donald Trump to its outside oversight board, as the company grapples with how to treat one of its highest-profile users after his exit from public office.<br />Earlier this month the social-media giant moved to disable Mr. Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts for at least two weeks, after he encouraged protests of the election results and his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a Jan. 6 attack that left five dead. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that the risks of Mr. Trump’s use of the platforms through Inauguration Day were too great.<br />“We believe our decision was necessary and right,” said Nick Clegg, Facebook’s communications and policy chief, in a blog post Thursday, one day after the swearing-in of President Joe Biden. “Given its significance, we think it is important for the board to review it and reach an independent judgment on whether it should be upheld.”<br />Mr. Trump has condemned the violence but defended his conduct ahead of the riot, which followed a monthslong effort to advance baseless claims of a rigged election. He faces a second impeachment trial in the Senate on a charge of inciting insurrection. Bipartisan political leaders including Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) have said publicly that Mr. Trump provoked the riot through his online and offline rhetoric.<br />Facebook said the former president’s accounts would remain suspended while five members of the 20-person oversight board determine whether certain posts he made before the riot had violated the company’s community standards and values.</td>

      <td>A devastating illness and an unconventional living arrangement push the bounds of friendship in this drama starring Dakota Johnson, Casey Affleck and Jason Segel.</td>
      <td>‘Our Friend” really does celebrate friendship. If that falls short of a bombshell, some explanation is in order. Gabriela Cowperthwaite’s beautiful and affecting drama is also about mortal illness, a terrible cancer that strikes a wife and mother in her prime, and devastates her husband and two young daughters as well. But artistry involves choices, and the abiding emphasis here is as unfashionable and open-hearted as the film’s title. It’s less on the ravages of the disease than on the changes that ensue when the couple’s best friend shows up to help out for two weeks, then stays to become part of the family. (Ticket and streaming info at ourfriendmovie.com.)<br />The stars are Dakota Johnson, Casey Affleck and Jason Segel; all three give flawless performances. Ms. Johnson is Nicole Teague, a buoyant woman who may not have lived up to the ardent prophecy of her boyfriend and, later, husband—“They’re going to say ‘There she is, the greatest living musical theater actress of all time!’” All the same, she enjoyed a modest career in regional theater until motherhood came along. Mr. Affleck is Nicole’s husband, Matt Teague, a journalist who, in real life, was the author of the 2015 Esquire Magazine article that the film was based on. The longtime friend is Dane Faucheux, who, in the adaptation by Brad Ingelsby and in Mr. Segel’s exquisite quicksilver portrayal, turns out to be not only indispensable but a pure soul, a lost soul, an unlikely soulmate of Mary Poppins and one of the most endearing characters to have graced the screen in recent memory.<br />Most of the action is set in and around Fairhope, Ala., a small town that’s home for Nicole, Matt and their kids, Molly (Isabella Kai) and Evie (Violet McGraw). But the narrative hops back and forth between present and past, always displaying time stamps that note how many years it is before or since Nicole’s diagnosis in 2012. The film is too long and its structure can be distracting, but it dramatizes the transformative nature of the event, and, in flashbacks to a happier time, the loving ties that bind Nicole and Matt to the man she’s known since college, and who subsequently became his best friend. (The cinematography, clear-eyed yet calmly lyrical, was done by Joe Anderson.)<br />Dane lives in New Orleans and works as a manager at a small sporting goods store. Wonderfully funny and poignantly charming, yet faintly haunted, he sustains his love life at a simmer and struggles with some sort of existential fear that isn’t specified and doesn’t need to be. We understand, just as Nicole and Matt do, that lack of ambition isn’t Dane’s problem; what he lacks is the belief that he can forge a good life for himself. Until, that is, he intervenes at a moment when his friends’ distress is spiraling out of control, and possibly saves himself in the process. (Mr. Segel is so touching, and Ms. Cowperthwaite’s direction so assured, that I happily embraced the movie’s most contrived sequence, one in which Dane goes on a solitary hike in a borderline-allegorical desert wilderness.)<br />The intimacy of Ms. Johnson’s performance is extraordinary. She is the least assertive of movie stars, yet the courage, despair and fury she finds in Nicole will lift you up and spin you around. Mr. Affleck’s dry precision, his gift for emitting while withholding like some master of Tibetan throat singing, confers a distinctive quality on Matt—a passionate remove that reveals his inability, at least at first, to confront his beloved’s decline. And the elegance of the film’s craftsmanship is all the more remarkable given that the director, Ms. Cowperthwaite, is best known for her 2013 “Blackfish,” a shocking and controversial documentary about captive killer whales at the SeaWorld chain of theme parks.</td>

      <td>A filmmaker directs a difficult subject—her husband; a small army of relatives reunite on a tropical island.</td>
      <td>‘Losing Alice” (Begins Friday, AppleTV), a gripping tale of ambition, struggles for success and numerous other kinds of psychological hunger, begins like many another dark tale—with a fateful meeting between strangers on a train. Hitchcock will come to mind. That he does is a testament to the strong whiff of menace that can arise in this eight-episode Israeli series —even from a fresh-faced young woman’s clear delight at recognizing her longtime idol, movie director Alice Ginor.<br />She’s played by a steadfastly enthralling Ayelet Zurer: The show is all hers. The young woman, who introduces herself as Sophie Marciano (Lihi Kornowski), elaborates on all that Alice’s films have meant to her. All of which Alice is pleased enough to hear, though she also looks quite recognizably like someone who would be happy to end the conversation and return to reading her cellphone. The authenticity of this opening scene holds a bright promise. Gradually, Sophie, still nattering on about her devotion, becomes a touch less endearing. “I wondered where you disappeared to,” she tells Alice, who requires no reminders that her film directing efforts are now sparse. She teaches, edits scripts and commercials, Alice explains, and she has a family.<br />And she is now about to become busy, she learns, dealing with Sophie, who has just dropped the news that she herself has written a film script and would love nothing more than for Alice’s husband, David (Gal Toren), a prominent actor, to star in it. Alice learns this on the train while holding an unlockable bathroom door closed for Sophie, who has dragooned her idol into the performance of this duty without hesitation—a reminder of her youth: She’s 24 years old. It’s the end of any suspicion this relationship might echo the one in “All About Eve.” Though this is just the beginning of Sophie’s entry into Alice’s life and career.<br />There is good reason, as the story unfolds, for an inclination to find the familiar, some pattern to relate to. For as it turns out, there is, in “Losing Alice”—which bills itself as a psychological thriller—a steady infusion of illusory events and other elements intended to deepen the mystery of this tale, many of which instead simply flatten the story into little points of confusion as flashy ventures of this kind tend to do.<br />Between those little points, fortunately, a rich drama emerges of ambition and the passion for achievement, not only in Alice but the world of filmmakers in which she travels. (The series is the creation of Sigal Avin.) The tone is undergirded by humor at its best, and not surprisingly, in the most erotic scenes. The ones that require Alice—who has been made director of Sophie’s film—to direct her husband making intimate love to a beautiful young woman. One of these leads to a moment of undeniable revelation when Alice, a cool, sophisticated professional, snaps out “Cut!” Why cut, her ever patient and honest husband wants to know—what’s wrong with the scene? Do it over, he’s told. The actors embrace again and again, the director snaps “Cut!” By this time David is livid, and shouting; the director can’t tell him what’s wrong with the take. Everyone else will have guessed—it’s unbearable to her.</td>

The line, which is now partially built but not operating, was eventually expected to transport 830,000 barrels of oil 1,210 miles from the Canadian oil sands to Steele City, Neb., where it would link to existing pipelines heading to Gulf Coast refineries.<br />Soon after TC proposed the pipeline, it ran into opposition from environmental groups. They cited the threat of spills, and they wanted to reduce the amount of oil extracted from Canada’s oil sands, widely seen as among the most greenhouse-gas intensive energy in the world.</td>

      <td>Dror Moreh’s documentary gives a behind-the-scenes look at 30 years of Israel-Palestine peace talks from the perspective of the American negotiators.</td>
      <td>After seeing “The Human Factor” at the Telluride Film Festival 18 months ago, I used the word “astonishing” to describe Dror Moreh’s account of America’s failed efforts to forge peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The film is no less so today as it goes into select theaters in New York and Los Angeles. It’s surely the most spellbinding documentary ever made about the mediation process. The events it depicts, beginning in 1991, have been colored ever more darkly by the passage of time. The idea of pursuing noble goals through persistent diplomatic give and take now seems like a vestige of a vanished era. Yet Mr. Moreh’s intimate history is more than a chronicle of failure. It’s a study of diplomacy as high and instructive drama, one in which a shifting cast of characters struggles to understand one another’s unstated motives and covert goals.<br />The story is told from the point of view of the American negotiators, a team led by the Middle East envoy Dennis Ross. In the first of many fascinating discussions, Mr. Ross explicates the notion that provides the film’s title. “You can’t ignore the human factor. Someone who has the human touch treats someone else with respect. Someone who has the human touch doesn’t think they’re going to outsmart anybody.” Like his on-camera narrator, though, Mr. Moreh, an Israeli filmmaker whose previous documentary feature was the 2012 Oscar-nominated “The Gatekeepers,” has a rich appreciation of contradiction. His title also reflects the all-too-human failing of seeing the world as one would like it to be, rather than as it is.<br />That’s not the case with American Secretary of State James Baker, who comes off here as a masterful negotiator with a gift for using great power to good ends. Nor does it describe Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, so determined to end hostilities with the Palestinians that he was secretly willing to risk civil war in his own divided country if that’s what it took to push a treaty through. As he and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat meet at the White House and sign a 1993 peace agreement—Oslo I, a set of intentionally ambiguous principles contained in the so-called Oslo Accords—“The Human Factor” is caught up in a crescendo of hope. Then the drama turns to high tragedy when, in 1995, Rabin is cut down by a lone gunman opposed to the Oslo Accords and the prospects of epochal peace die with him. (Mr. Ross tries to discuss the impact of Rabin’s death, but, more than two decades later, he still can’t get the words out of his mouth.)<br />The former Israeli foreign minister Abba Eban famously quipped that the Palestinians “never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.” The film suggests that Arafat was ready to seize the opportunity presented by Rabin. After the assassination, however, the quip might have described not only Arafat but others seated at a succession of negotiating tables. Following a resurgence of violence in Jerusalem that threatened to end any hope of peace, President Bill Clinton brought all parties together at a White House summit. There, during a lunch, Mr. Ross tells us, King Hussein of Jordan turned to Israel’s new hardline prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and said “You don’t have the maturity to be a leader. You’re not like Rabin. You have to grow up and become a leader, and you’re not one today.” We’re also told that Ehud Barak, who succeeded Mr. Netanyahu in 1999—a decade before Mr. Netanyahu became prime minister once again—fancied himself another Churchill; he was mistaken.<br />The great distinction of “The Human Factor” is its intimacy. Mr. Moreh achieves it by combining on-camera interviews—with Mr. Ross and other mediators on his team—with a wealth of still photos shot inside the negotiating chambers; he interweaves them so skillfully that we seem to be witnessing fateful discussions in real time. Thirty years after the U.S.-sponsored Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative began, there is no peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and no roadmap pointing toward it. Yet the film provides a basic map for keeping the peace in whatever sphere—political, commercial or personal. The principles it expounds begin and end with empathy, an abstract quality that Mr. Ross brings down to ground level with a familiar formulation. “The essence of empathy,” he says, “is the capacity to put yourself in someone else’s shoes.”</td>

      <td>Ukraine’s dystopic Oscar entry takes place in a polluted landscape strewn with abandoned machinery and frozen corpses.</td>
      <td>Taking the waters takes on new meaning in “Atlantis,” a fearfully powerful feature by Valentyn Vasyanovych and Ukraine’s Oscar entry for international features. In 2025, just one dystopian year after the supposed end of the Russo-Ukraine war, an army vet, Sergiy (Andriy Rymaruk), ekes out a living trucking water to polluted areas of his native Eastern Ukraine. When he decides to take a long-needed bath, he pumps some of the precious stuff from his truck into the amputated bucket of a vanished excavator, lights a wood fire under the huge clawed thing and absorbs the all-too-fleeting warmth.<br />Warmth is hard to come by in Sergiy’s life. He spends long minutes ironing a pair of frozen pants that he’s retrieved from a clothesline outside his scruffy apartment. Long, slow rituals are the hallmark of this film, none of them longer, slower, more meticulous or riveting, in their grisly way, than the work of a volunteer team that recovers and autopsies corpses strewn all across the ravaged land. Most of the bodies are partially mummified, a fit condition for a partially mummified country (and, as befits its title, a sunken land).<br />By now I may have convinced you to put “Atlantis” at the top of your don’t-watch list. If that’s the case, please reconsider. (The film is currently streaming on metrograph.com/live-screenings/atlantis/, and will expand to virtual cinemas next week.) Mr. Vasyanovych’s approach is literally and figuratively visionary. One aspect of the vision is its treatment of machinery. Not since Jennifer Baichwal’s seminal 2006 documentary “Manufactured Landscapes” has there been a motion picture in which enormous encrusted things—trucks, freight trains, a steel factory in terminal fever—possess more vitality than some of the tired souls who run them.<br />That has the indirect effect of expressing the devastation of the Russo-Ukraine war. But another part of the vision is the spectacle of hope rising, uncertainly but persistently, from the vast ashes. World-weary though he may be, Sergiy is attracted to one of the members of the recovery team, Katya (Liudmyla Bileka), an archaeologist before the war. He’s candid with her about his attachment to this shattered place. He can no longer live among normal people, he tells her. But she understands. Normal isn’t the issue. Living is.<br />Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com</td>

      <td>In Hungary’s Oscar entry, a neurosurgeon worries she’s losing her mind after a man with whom she is smitten claims that he does not know her.</td>
      <td>The title of Hungary’s Oscar entry is pleasingly, quirkily long—“Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time”—and the premise is irresistible. Márta (Natasa Stork), a superstar Hungarian brain surgeon living in New Jersey, meets a fellow neurosurgeon at a scientific conference. Before discovering that he’s Hungarian too—his name is Janós and he’s played by Viktor Bodó—she decides he’s the man for her, not merely Mr. Right but Dr. Perfect. They talk. She’s captivated. But he’s returning to Hungary after the conference, so they agree to meet at a given time on a given day on the Pest side of Budapest’s Liberty Bridge. Then, throwing caution and very possibly part of her career to the wind, she flies back to the country of her birth, only to discover that he’s a no-show. When she tracks him down near the hospital where he works, he looks at her blankly, insisting they’ve never met.<br />Hello Alfred Hitchcock! Hey there, Krzysztof Kieslowski, and Franz Kafka too! This tale of obsession by Lili Horvát is so sensuous and richly detailed that you can hardly wait for the mystery to be explained. And once it is? Well, there’s no way to say it but to say it—enthrallment gives way to disappointment, because the reveal isn’t equal to the buildup. Yet you’ve still had the experience of being taken in—much more in a good way than a bad one—by a gifted filmmaker wielding cinema’s seductive power.<br />It’s a paradox. What I recall most vividly isn’t the letdown but a host of hypnotic moments leading up to it, and the intensity of Ms. Stork’s performance. (Róbert Maly did the sharp-focus cinematography.) Whether or not he remembers her, Márta and Janós join forces as surgeons. She operates, with him in admiring attendance, on a man who’s lost the ability to recall certain words. Exploring her patient’s brain, Márta takes exquisite pains to avoid injuring its precious speech center. But Janós’s continued emotional distance leads her to believe, in the privacy of her thoughts in her rented room, that she may be losing her mind. Movies are seldom flawless and don’t have to be. This one speaks more eloquently to how a spell can be woven rather than broken.<br />Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden will keep Christopher Wray in place as FBI director, the White House confirmed Thursday, providing stability atop the nation’s premier law-enforcement agency as the new administration confronts the rising threat of domestic extremism after the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol.<br />The decision comes as the Federal Bureau of Investigation continues its probe of hundreds of members of the pro-Trump mob that stormed the halls of Congress on Jan. 6—one of the most substantial investigations undertaken in U.S. history. Agency watchdogs are scrutinizing the government’s inability to prevent the deadly attack.<br />The acting U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., Michael Sherwin, who has been running the investigation into the riot, briefed the new Justice Department leadership on Wednesday about the sprawling inquiry that has already led to the arrest of more than 100 alleged rioters on federal charges, with hundreds more under investigation, an agency spokesman confirmed.<br />Investigators are moving swiftly to probe the activities of alleged right-wing militia members who may have planned the attack and some of the more violent incidents, including assaults on police officers, as many of the charged defendants have begun cooperating, law-enforcement officials said. Prosecutors are also expected to charge in the coming days people who allegedly attacked members of the media during the riot, officials said.<br />Biden administration officials have told U.S. attorneys around the country, many of whom were appointed by former President Donald Trump, to stay in their roles for now. It plans to replace them individually in the coming months rather than ask them to leave all at once, Justice Department officials said.</td>

      <td>Kimberley Strassel’s “Big Business’s Sharp Left Turn” (Potomac Watch, Jan. 15) reminds me of my youth in Maryland where the local lunch counters had signs saying: “We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.” In the time of Jim Crow laws, everyone knew what that meant: unless you were white, you would not receive service at the lunch counter. The argument was that “this is a private business, so we can set our own rules.” The courts finally said something to the effect of, yes, it is a private business, but the doors are open to the general public, therefore you cannot refuse service to any customer because of race. As a result, the lunch counters and other public businesses were integrated.<br />Sadly, those signs have returned, although not targeting nonwhites at lunch counters, but instead targeting conservatives on social-media platforms, etc. Apparently, conservatives are now being considered an undesirable class of citizens.<br />As the courts threw out double standards of service for whites versus nonwhites by public, but privately owned, businesses, perhaps there is a legal remedy for the double standard against conservative speech.<br />Michael R.

Make no mistake, every aspect of this project poses significant risks to our environment and our communities.<br />For starters, LNG is especially harmful to the climate. In every step of its life cycle, LNG emits methane—a powerful greenhouse gas that is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide. LNG is also potentially explosive. Even the tiniest leak can ignite fires and explosions. The project would move LNG over hundreds of miles through heavily populated areas in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, ripping through black, brown and low-income communities and putting thousands at risk of deadly accidents.<br />The Gibbstown site also appears to violate rules governing toxic PCB water pollution. PCBs, one of only a handful of chemicals ever banned in the U.S., are especially dangerous to pregnant women and unborn children. Pollution from PCBs has turned the nearby Hudson River into one the largest Superfund sites in the nation and decimated the Hudson’s once-thriving commercial fishery.<br />Astonishingly, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has failed to even conduct a full study of the project’s environmental impacts, as required by bedrock federal environmental law.</td>

After the companies detailed plans to split  DowDuPont  into three separate entities, activist firms also challenged the breakup plan.<br />Starboard Value LP, one of Wall Street’s best-known activists, confirmed Thursday that it has nominated a slate of directors to take over two-thirds of Corteva’s board. The firm called for Corteva to replace its chief executive, Jim Collins, potentially with an unnamed CEO candidate Starboard has in mind. The Wall Street Journal reported Starboard’s push late Wednesday.<br />Starboard and its CEO, Jeff Smith, said Corteva has been slow to improve its profitability, missed opportunities to improve its operations and hasn’t held Mr. Collins accountable. “Corteva and its shareholders deserve better,” Mr. Smith wrote Thursday in a letter to Corteva’s board.<br />Greg Page, Corteva’s chairman, said Thursday that the company’s board unanimously supported Mr. Collins. Corteva’s directors and executives have met several times with Starboard and agreed on some of the firm’s points, Mr. Page said, but so far Starboard hadn’t made specific recommendations to improve the company’s operations.</td>

The extension is likely to be agreed upon quickly despite friction between Washington and Moscow, current and former officials said.<br />A five-year extension would provide a measure of predictability to the U.S. and Russian military competition and has been urged by pro-arms control groups. In addition to limiting long-range nuclear arms, the accord provides for weapons inspections and monitoring.<br />With the demise of the U.S.-Russian treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear forces, New START is the last major building block in the legal regime that regulates the nuclear competition between the U.S. and Russia.</td>

The jump has come amid enthusiasm over GM’s electric-vehicle plans and  Microsoft Corp.’s  investment this week in Cruise, GM’s majority-owned autonomous-car division.<br />Investors have come to expect double-digit stock moves from  Tesla Inc.  and a bevy of electric-vehicle startups that have gone public over the last year.

      <td>The humble fisherman’s knit is a cozy, versatile staple—and a better outfit enhancer than your tired hoodie. Here, expert tips on how to wear it as smartly as Sally Albright does.</td>
      <td>AT THE OUTSET of 2021, after flinging open a trunk where I store overflow clothing, I fished out a treasure: a wool fisherman’s sweater from A.P.C that I bought on sale a decade ago and have sporadically worn since. The color of oatmeal, it is slightly scratchy and unyielding, weighing my shoulders and billowing into a Winnie the Pooh-ish belly no matter my posture. That said, like any fisherman’s sweater, it’s hyper-functional, super-duper warm, low-key and unflappably resistant to the ebbs and flows of fashion.<br />As such, this classic knit is my ideal non-athleisure garment for this moment. While relatively comfortable, it still lends my looks an air of put-togetherness. Edith Young, 27, a New York writer and artist agrees: “It reads as more intentional than a fleece, which I associate with walking to the gym pre-pandemic.”<br />The fisherman’s sweater has popped up in pop culture in films like “Love Story” and “The Thomas Crown Affair,” but the most indelible iteration is the flame-red version that Meg Ryan’s Sally Albright wears again and again throughout the 1989 romantic comedy “When Harry Met Sally.” It’s what Sally has layered beneath a corduroy jacket when she and her old acquaintance Harry (Billy Crystal) run into each other at a bookstore, and on it stays throughout their multi-scene catch-up in the park and out to lunch. Later, when the still-platonic pair set up Harry’s bachelor pad and compare dating woes, our heroine is back in her cozy rosy pullover, now tucked into a black skirt.<br />Also known as Aran sweaters, named for the islands off the coast of Galway where they originated, these garments were traditionally handmade by fishermen’s wives and bear intricate patterns said to be imbued with meaning. The cable stitch, for instance, is believed to have been inspired by Irish fishermen’s ropes and to confer good luck at sea. The zigzag, some contend, represents the ups and downs of marriage.<br />“I consider my fisherman sweater to be an old friend,” said Portland, Maine-based Owen Kelly, who’s in his 40s. Mr. Kelly is the V.P. of product creation at L.L. Bean, which has sold versions of the classic since 1981, when they were cornerstones of the then-pivotal preppy uniform. The brand’s cotton fisherman was its Men’s Signature line’s bestselling sweater in 2020.</td>

Some of the business’s partners and clients said they would cut ties to Mr. Trump after his supporters stormed the Capitol in an effort to overturn President Biden’s election win.<br />Eric Trump, who has been running the Trump Organization since his father took the White House, said in an interview Thursday that the family business was in strong financial shape.<br />“I have 75 million people who would follow my father to the ends of the Earth,” he said. “He’s got probably the most famous brand in the world.

      <td>New research shows that people across the political spectrum have similar views about when and how wealth should be redistributed.</td>
      <td>Psychologist Alison Gopnik explores new discoveries in the science of human nature. Read previous columns here.<br />What do the haves owe to the have-nots? Should a society redistribute resources from some people to others? These questions are central to the economic policy differences between left and right. The opposing views might seem completely irreconcilable. But a new paper in the journal Cognition suggests that people of all political stripes have surprisingly similar views about redistribution, at least in the abstract.<br />Daniel Nettle at Newcastle University and Rebecca Saxe at MIT presented 2,400 people in the U.K. with stories about how an imaginary village could divvy up the food people grew in their gardens. A simple graphic allowed the participants to say how much food they thought should go from villagers who had more to those who had less.<br />The scenario allowed the researchers to systematically vary aspects of the problem. They looked at four factors. How much did the garden yields depend on luck? In some versions of the scenario, the weather had a big influence on how much food each villager produced; in others, luck was less important. How homogenous was the village? In some versions the villagers had very similar “beliefs, customs and appearance,” in others they were “rather different.” Were the villagers at peace with other villages or under attack? And was food abundant or scarce in general?<br />The participants also reported how far to the right or left their politics were, and across the spectrum the results were very consistent. Everybody thought there should be some redistribution of food—there weren’t any real Scrooges. People of all political persuasions thought there should be more redistribution when luck played a larger role, when the village was more homogenous, when the village was under attack and when resources were abundant. Political views did play a small role in people’s judgments: Those on the right were slightly less likely to redistribute than those on the left. But politics was much less important than the particular story of that village.</td>

      <td>The accord sets out a framework to prevent climate change and seeks to limit the rise in overall global temperature</td>
      <td>In one of his first acts as president, Joe Bidenissued an executive order returning the U.S. to the Paris Climate Agreement. The U.S. had helped shape the accord under President Barack Obama but seven months after the pact took effect in late 2016, President Donald Trump withdrew the country.<br />The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international accord—though it is not a treaty—that was adopted at a United Nations climate conference in Paris in December 2015. It entered into force on Nov. 4, 2016, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified it.<br />The accord sets out a global framework to prevent dangerous climate change. It seeks to limit the rise in overall global temperature to less than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, with a target of no more than 1.5 degrees. Alongside this it aims to help countries financially in their efforts to tackle climate change and its impact.<br />Former President Donald Trump believed the accord put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage because of regulatory and financial burdens it would put on American companies. On announcing the U.S. departure in June 2017, he called the move a “reassertion of our sovereignty.”<br />Mr. Trump framed his decision mostly in economic and political terms, pointing to the agreement’s lesser requirements for the world’s other leading carbon emitters, China and India. He voiced concern for protecting the environment but he said his decision was rooted in protecting the country’s interests.</td>

      <td>The Vatican court sentenced Angelo Caloia and his lawyer to almost nine years in prison amid a cleanup of bank finances</td>
      <td>ROME—A Vatican court found a former president of the Vatican bank guilty of embezzlement and money laundering during the pontificates of St. John Paul and Pope Benedict XVI, closing a chapter in the long-term cleanup of its finances.<br />The court said that Angelo Caloia and his lawyer, Gabriele Liuzzo, had manipulated sales of the scandal-plagued bank’s real-estate assets for their own profit from 2001 to 2008.<br />Mr. Caloia, who is 81, and Mr. Liuzzo, 97, whose trial began in 2018, were each sentenced to 8 years and 11 months in prison. Mr. Liuzzo’s son Lamberto Liuzzo, 55, was sentenced to five years and two months in prison for his part in the scheme. The men were also ordered to pay the bank €23 million ($27.9 million) in compensation.<br />None of the men were present in court for the sentencing. An attorney for Mr. Caloia, Domenico Pulitanò, said he would appeal. Lawyers for Gabriele and Lamberto Liuzzo didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.<br />At their indictment in 2018, Vatican prosecutors accused Mr. Caloia and his lawyer of causing losses of more than €50 million for the bank, officially known as the Institute for the Works of Religion. The men were accused of embezzling money from the sale of 29 of the bank’s properties, most of them in or near Rome. However, the court found insufficient evidence to convict in regard to some of the properties.</td>

      <td>Wyoming Republican draws primary opponent, faces calls for removal from GOP party post</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Last week, Rep. Liz Cheney broke with most of her party to vote to impeach then-President Donald Trump.<br />Now the top-ranking House Republican is contending with the consequences, both in Washington and at home in Wyoming.<br />Mr. Trump’s allies in the House GOP are circulating a petition aimed at setting up a vote calling on Ms. Cheney to resign her leadership position as GOP conference chairwoman. Meanwhile in Wyoming—where Mr. Trump had his biggest victories of any state both in 2016 and 2020—Ms. Cheney drew her first primary opponent on Wednesday, when state Sen. Anthony Bouchard said he would challenge her.<br />As the Republican Party grapples with its future after Mr. Trump’s departure Wednesday, Ms. Cheney’s fate will be an early indicator of which direction GOP lawmakers plan to go. Many House Republicans represent solidly-red districts and have largely remained unified behind Mr. Trump, even in his final, tumultuous weeks in office. Now they are deciding whether to demote Ms. Cheney for her stance on impeachment, without a clear sense of how much power Mr. Trump will wield over Republicans in the future.<br />The daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, Ms. Cheney was one of just 10 House Republicans and the only member of House GOP leadership to vote to impeach Mr. Trump last week on accusations that he incited the violent insurrection at the Capitol earlier this month. GOP aides said much of the concern emerged the night before the vote, when Ms. Cheney issued a statement explaining her intention to vote to impeach the president and her rationale.</td>

      <td>President directs Occupational Safety and Health Administration to quickly require employers to adopt protocols for protecting workers from virus</td>
      <td>President Biden directed a federal workplace-safety regulator to require employers to develop coronavirus protocols and enforce compliance.<br />Mr. Biden asked the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in a planned executive action Thursday to pursue an emergency temporary standard that would set Covid-19 workplace-safety requirements, as part of a series of executive orders this week.<br />“It is critical that the federal government protect the health and safety of America’s workers and take swift action to prevent workers from contracting COVID-19 in the workplace,” the Biden administration said a pandemic strategy document.<br />Labor and business groups expect OSHA to implement a rule quickly. The process for issuing an emergency standard isn’t as involved as the traditional federal rule-making process, in part because it lets government skip the usual public-comment period.<br />Many Democrats and worker advocates support developing a federal rule. Republicans and businesses worry that could become a burden for employers to implement.</td>

      <td>President Biden’s overt religiosity is a relatively modern trend in U.S. history.</td>
      <td>Presidential inaugural addresses are unpredictable, but it’s a good bet that they will refer to the Bible. President Biden did, quoting Psalm 30:5: “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.” This is part of a welcome, long-running trend toward more religious language in public life.<br />Mr. Biden has cited Psalm 30 in speeches before, and it seems particularly apt in these dark times. Mr. Biden also encouraged his fellow Americans to “open our souls instead of hardening our hearts,” an allusion to God hardening Pharaoh’s heart, beginning with Exodus 7:13.<br />With these references, 27 out of 45 presidents have cited the Bible in their inaugural addresses, making a total of 64 biblical references. Forty-four came from the Hebrew Bible and 20 from the New Testament. John F. Kennedy, the only Catholic president before Mr. Biden, made the most allusions in one speech, with five. He referenced the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, including Isaiah 58:6’s call to “undo the heavy burdens . . . and to let the oppressed go free” and Romans 12:12’s “rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation.”<br />The tradition of biblical allusions in inaugural addresses dates back to the beginning of the Republic, when George Washington made an argument for them. In his first inaugural, Washington referred to Psalm 82. “It would be peculiarly improper,” he said, “to omit in this official act my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of the nations.”<br />Somewhat more surprising is the biblical reference from Thomas Jefferson, a deist who famously excised from a Bible any references to Jesus’ divinity. Jefferson spoke hopefully of a chosen country with “room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth generation,” an allusion to Exodus 20:6.</td>

      <td>U.S. carriers are hoping that pent-up demand for leisure travel could be unleashed as soon as this summer</td>
      <td>Airline stocks are a bet on a summer travel boom. One is certainly possible after a year or more of people being mostly stuck at home, but so far investors have little to go on but hope.<br />Shares of  United Airlines  fell around 6% Thursday morning, dragging down peers. The Chicago-based airline on Wednesday reported a $1.9 billion net loss for the fourth quarter and estimated that its first-quarter revenue will be 65% to 70% lower than in the same period of 2019.<br />Terrible numbers are unsurprising. Even in normal times, airlines struggle to make a profit during the winter months. And after a brief winter-holiday bump, traffic remains depressed amid the continuing Covid-19 pandemic. Corporate travel is expected to take years to recover, which is of particular concern to United’s business-focused network.<br />Airline stocks have given up the sizable gains made in recent days after United’s competitor  Delta Air Lines suggested last week that there could be a boom in leisure travel as soon as this summer. “Visits across Delta’s digital channels are significantly outpacing the passenger volumes we’re carrying,” said Chief Executive Ed Bastian, adding that holders of Delta’s co-branded  American Express  card were keeping their points in anticipation of redeeming them for air travel in 2021.<br />A poll by brokerage Jefferies published Wednesday showed that 80% of Americans who flew in 2019 plan to do so again this year, most of them in the summer.</td>

      <td>10 months on, a small cohort of tailoring traditionalists still refuses to trade ties for T-shirts</td>
      <td>LAST YEAR was all about shlumpy sweatpants, plush house slippers and mundane Zoom shirts. As many Americans shifted to working from home—and later trickled back into offices—our wardrobes took a hard left turn into the world of casual wear. But even as elastic waists and jersey became de rigueur for a chunk of the corporate class, a smaller portion of WFH men—let’s call them tailoring holdouts—continue to cling to their blazers, suits and neckties like life rafts in a tumultuous year. These men found comfort in their sartorial formality, even if they never want to be labeled “the tie guy” on Zoom calls ever again.<br />What’s behind this tailoring commitment? For starters, many of these suit stalwarts are nagged by a feeling that they must maintain some level of decorum even from home. Last summer, months after the pandemic’s onset, Shawn Sukumar, 37, a trial lawyer in Washington, D.C., had his court hearings moved to video call. Though none of his superiors or others on-high specified a dress code, he felt it best to toe the line and wear his suit and tie on the calls. He believes you should look polished when speaking before a court—even digitally. And if you’re wondering: No, he never wore anything but full trousers with his sport coat even though he was only shown from the waist up. No shorts. Certainly no boxers. “I don’t trust the video on that. I wear pants every time.”<br />Mr. Sukumar’s legal colleagues tend to stick to suits during hearings, too, but formal fusspots who work in other fields look conspicuously odd on Zoom in their blazered looks. When his dining room became his office, Graham Pickering, 31, an engineer for an energy company outside New Orleans, continued to button up his dress shirts and blazers each day. “I just wanted to put my best foot forward because we’re a traditional conservative company in a conservative industry. I didn’t want to appear to be taking advantage of [working from home],” he said. Yet, he admits that many of his co-workers didn’t maintain such fastidious standards—and that even his boss “would probably laugh” at his sartorial rigidity.<br />Others feel formality encourages an industrious mind-set. Fraser Martens, 33, an economic analyst in Moscow, Idaho, has been working from home since early last year. Without his commute, or office interactions, he craves “structure” during workdays. He finds it in his chambray dress shirts and Brooks Brothers ties, which communicate to himself, “OK, it’s time for work. You’re going to be sitting in your bedroom, but you are wearing your work clothes.”<br />But on some level, the truth is tailoring traditionalists just like dressing up. Brandon Mitchell, 38, a Bronx-based marketing director for a nonprofit, has a closet brimming with vintage tweed jackets and flannel trousers. To him clothes are a hobby he’s compelled to indulge. As his work shifted to video calls, colleagues ribbed him that he’d be swapping his coats and ties for T-shirts in no time. Mr. Mitchell took that as a challenge and beginning in March, he started cataloging his raffish outfits on Instagram. A peak-lapel sport coat with a yellow tie one day, a glen-check blazer with brown trousers the next, a Gregory Peck-esque flannel suit the following week. His outfits were a lighthearted way to mark time during lockdown.</td>

      <td>The big vacation rental sites can easily overwhelm prospective renters. These five smaller alternatives are regionally focused, easily managed—and seriously picky.</td>
      <td>THE LANDSCAPE of vacation rentals is vast and uncharted. It’s easy to get lost in a search for a perfect beach house or mountain cabin and—between extraordinary demand and an unbelievable clutter of duds—it's not so easy to find one. To relieve the stress, niche vacation rental companies are curating collections, helping claustrophobia-plagued city-dwellers to winnow possibilities down to that one dreamy escape. As travel anxieties continue to simmer, regionally specific sites offer good drive-to options. “And people don’t just rent on weekends anymore,” said Jennifer Grimes, founder of Red Cottage Inc. in upstate New York. “Last March, it was like a switch was flipped, from short breaks to [long-term] escape properties. Renters are not necessarily burning vacation days. When all this ends, people are going to go on vacation for six months.” Hear hear! To help find a place to hang your hat, here are five specialists:<br />Founded in 2007, long before the hickster renaissance of the Catskills, Red Cottage Inc. seeks out houses with exceptional interiors. The collection of 52 properties—expected to grow by 40% this year, according to the founder—ranges from rustic cabins to country estates, almost all of which are exclusively listed. Many feature nature-gazing conveniences: for example, a hot tub, fire pit, or outdoor pavilion and integrated kitchen. The houses tend to be remote so they’re equipped with amenities like Wi-Fi switches for the front light, so city slickers don’t get freaked out by the pitch black.<br />A-list Example: The three-bedroom Basecamp, like a modern Swedish summer house plopped down on 19 private acres in Saugerties, N.Y., from $500 a night, redcottageinc.com<br />Holly Williams is a musician (she’s Hank’s granddaughter) and entrepreneur (her shop, White’s Mercantile, originated in Nashville and is now a mini empire in the south). And she has a thing for houses. She finds historic relics to renovate—or “redeem,” as she says—with a modern-meets-Southern design aesthetic. At the three rental properties that make up her White’s Room and Board portfolio, you’ll find a mix of her grandmother’s oil paintings with her husband Chris Coleman’s striking black-and-white works on paper, as well as leather club chairs, floral wallpaper, things found in French flea markets, claw-foot tubs and sisal rugs.<br />A-list Example: Sweeney Cottage, an 1892 dollhouse in Leiper’s Fork, with a chic little kitchen with a mint green Smeg refrigerator, a Bertazzoni stove and a doormat that says “Howdy,” from $250 a night, whitesroomandboard.com</td>

      <td>FRANKFURT—The European Central Bank kept its large monetary stimulus unchanged on Thursday, pledging to continue backstopping the region’s governments via large-scale debt purchases as a stubborn wave of Covid-19 infections darkened the economic outlook.<br />In a statement, the ECB said it would continue to buy up to 1.85 trillion euros, equivalent to $2.24 trillion, of eurozone bonds through March 2022, as planned, meaning that it will continue to absorb the bulk of the debt issued by eurozone countries this year.<br />The ECB’s bond purchases support the region’s governments as they spend freely on job-furlough and other programs aimed at keeping businesses and jobs alive. The ECB left its key interest rate unchanged at minus 0.5%.<br />Europe’s economic outlook has darkened since the ECB’s last policy meeting in December, when President Christine Lagarde unveiled a large new stimulus package. With infection rates still high across the region, governments in Germany and other countries have signaled in recent days that they will tighten or extend social restrictions. Meanwhile, the rollout of vaccinations has been sluggish.<br />Analysts worry that the region’s $13 trillion economy will slide back into recession in the first three months of 2021, as businesses and households remain cautious. Eurozone inflation has been below zero for the past five months, through December, far from the ECB’s target of just below 2%. The euro has also staged a rally against the dollar in recent months, hurting the competitiveness of Europe’s large exporters in crucial overseas markets such as the U.S.</td>

The national rollout of Covid-19 vaccine doses, they agreed, wasn’t going fast enough.<br />By the end of the stroll, they had sketched the outline of a plan to speed things up: Combine the logistics technology of  Honeywell International Inc.,  the expertise of health system Atrium Health, and the real estate of Tepper Sports & Entertainment to inoculate thousands more people a day than the average North Carolina vaccination site currently does.<br />“It’s the last mile,” Honeywell Chief Executive Darius Adamczyk said of the problems that have plagued the vaccine rollout. Mr. Adamczyk is part of the North Carolina trio, along with Atrium CEO Eugene Woods and Tepper President Tom Glick. “We dramatically need to pick up the pace.”<br />The North Carolina executives aren’t the only business leaders stepping in to offer private-sector expertise to help more Americans get Covid-19 shots.<br />Washington state this week said that private companies will lend expertise to accelerate its vaccine rollout, among them  Starbucks Corp. , which will provide help with vaccine-administration facility layout and has started working on ways to reduce patient wait times.</td>

But analysts surveyed by FactSet foresee lower sales this year, in part reflecting a pair of divestitures and growing competitive pressure. And while Intel has benefited from a boom in demand for PCs in the work-from-home economy, much of the added buying has focused on lower-cost laptops that aren’t as profitable. Net income for 2020 is expected to fall to $19.3 billion, from $21.1 billion the year prior.<br />Intel’s longer-term strategy around the outsourcing of chip production is also in flux ahead of the arrival of Pat Gelsinger as CEO. Bob Swan, the company’s departing chief executive, said last year that a decision was forthcoming by early this year on whether to have the company’s advanced chips made by a third party after Intel fell behind Asian rivals in the development of the next generation of superfast semiconductors.<br />The company is considering outsourcing production of some of its most prized chips to those Asian rivals, and particularly to  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , the largest and most advanced contract chip maker in the world, according to people familiar with the matter.</td>

The effect was more pronounced among residents, the company said, an 80% reduction in risk of Covid-19.<br />The findings signal the potential for a new preventive weapon that could augment the fledgling Covid-19 vaccination effort to stem the pandemic.<br />Lilly said it would ask U.S. health regulators to widen the drug’s authorized use to include protecting people in long-term-care facilities where someone has recently been diagnosed with Covid-19.<br />The partial results were from a last-stage, or Phase 3, study conducted in partnership with the National Institutes of Health. Lilly disclosed the data in a news release and said it plans to publish full results in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</td>

Shares traded just below $31 on Wednesday.<br />ETFs tracking the S&P 500’s technology, communication, consumer-discretionary and health-care sectors surpassed their pre-Covid-19 highs last year.

JPMorgan Chase  & Co. and  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  account for about a quarter of the fund, while the addition of  Bank of America Corp.  increases the collective weighting of the three stocks to roughly 33%. It is no surprise then that the ETF’s return to record levels coincided with a rally in those stocks.</td>

      <td>Influenza, usually raging throughout the Northern Hemisphere this time of year, has become virtually invisible.<br />It is a small bright spot amid Covid-19, although the number of people saved from a flu death pales next to the number dying from the new pandemic. It also presents questions that doctors around the globe will likely be wrestling with for years: If flu can be nearly wiped out this season, why not every season? Which steps help the most to stop the flu from spreading?<br />“This is an extremely puzzling phenomenon. We’re in a historic, unbelievable situation,” said Norio Sugaya, a pediatrician who serves on a World Health Organization influenza committee.<br />The WHO says the measures people and governments are taking to prevent the spread of Covid-19, such as wearing masks and limiting public gatherings, have probably helped keep the flu in check. Increased flu vaccination rates may also be contributing, it says.<br />Another hypothesis holds that the broad spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, in countries like the U.S. may play a role in blocking the flu by lifting people’s immunity against other viruses. One study in the spring of 2020 in New York City found that people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were far less likely to be carrying other common viruses such as influenza viruses. Still, research into that hypothesis is just beginning.</td>

An official statement from Mr. Rasool didn’t include further details about the pursuit of the attackers.</td>

      <td>Women have fallen fast for Bumble’s platform, but investors may want to take it slow</td>
      <td>Is Bumble Inc.’s bet on women worth the buzz? That might depend on whether its mission also flies with men.<br />The owner of the No. 2 dating app has filed to go public with valuation talk in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion. Founder Whitney Wolfe Herd started it in 2014 to turn the traditional dating dynamic on its head. Instead of men initiating contact with women, who often say that attention is often aggressive or unwanted, Bumble was created as a platform on which women must make the first move. That was two years after Ms. Wolfe Herd co-founded dating app Tinder, which is now known mostly for its singles looking for hookups. She has said she saw the problems with archaic dating rules and sought to change them.<br />For women looking for love, this has been a popular tack: Bumble says it believes its namesake app has one of the highest percentages of women paying users among dating apps. The question is whether it will prove to be a lucrative one for investors.<br />A higher percentage of the Bumble app’s users convert to payers than the market average among dating apps, according to OC&C Strategy Consultants—nearly 9% paid conversion among its 12.3 million monthly active users, the company said.<br />But a women-centric approach also could pose some limitations to growth. Men are currently the significant majority of online dating users, according to the company. And while some men may enjoy sitting back and waiting to be approached, the preference doesn’t appear to be unanimous: Bumble says it has about 30% more female users for every male user compared with the gender mix of users in the North America freemium dating market who don’t use Bumble, citing OC&C.</td>

Most hedge funds hold preferred shares that carry a dividend. These shares are junior to the government’s stake and thus don’t get paid dividends until after the government is paid. So their value is greatly diminished by the large stake the government retains.<br />In one scenario where hedge funds would profit, Fannie and Freddie would raise fresh capital, junior preferred shares would be converted to common stock, and the government would write down or eliminate its senior preferred shares.<br />Investors including John Paulson, Anchorage Capital Group, Discovery Capital Management LLC, Blackstone Credit, Perry Capital, Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management LP and PointState Capital LP have been involved in the trade. Many funds are now expected to have lost money on the investment, though some early buyers and active traders profited.<br />It was a risky bet. But other complex, long-shot trades, including the subprime bet that the housing market would collapse, resulted in big paydays for some funds.</td>

      <td>A tougher regulatory approach—and probably slower growth—now look inevitable</td>
      <td>Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, once the richest man in the country, has resurfaced after being out of the public eye for months. But his real troubles—and those of his business empire—may be just beginning.<br />Mr. Ma made his first public appearance in nearly three months on Wednesday, speaking to a group of rural teachers in an online philanthropic event. Speculation about his whereabouts has been rife since his last public appearance in October, when he gave a speech that angered regulators. Since then, the record initial public offerings of fintech firm Ant Group, which Mr. Ma controls, were both pulled at the last minute. China’s antitrust regulator launched a probe into the business practices of e-commerce giant  Alibaba ,  another company in Mr. Ma’s empire, last month.<br />Investors took Mr. Ma’s reappearance as an auspicious sign—Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed shares jumped 8.5% Wednesday. They may have inferred that Mr. Ma is now back in Beijing’s good graces and the regulatory storm will be over. But there doesn’t seem to be a letup: on the same day Mr. Ma made his public appearance, China’s central bank released draft rules governing nonbank payment systems, in which Ant’s Alipay is a major player.<br />There are still uncertainties about what some of the draft rules mean. The rules, for example, say if two players have more than two-thirds of the nonbank payment markets—Alipay and Tencent’s  WeChat  Pay dominate China’s mobile and internet payments—then the central bank would hold talks with the companies. It’s unclear what the exact consequences or remedies would be after such warnings, though. The rules also seem to use a broader definition of market—possibly including some traditional payment channels—to determine whether a payment company is market-dominating.<br />But the overall direction seems clear: the government wants stricter regulation of fast-growing online financial services, which could add systemic risks to the country’s state-dominated financial system. Beijing likely views China’s ubiquitous mobile payment systems as a positive contribution to society, but it is more skeptical when companies like Ant leverage their user base and consumer data to jump into online lending.</td>

      <td>President seeks to jump-start effort to slow the virus’s spread with a series of executive orders</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden’s success in achieving some of his biggest policy objectives—curbing climate change, expanding health coverage and overhauling immigration laws—will depend in large part on his success in combating the coronavirus pandemic, which he sought to jump-start Thursday with a national road map and a series of executive orders.<br />Health experts both inside and outside the new administration agree that while accelerating vaccinations will help restore normalcy and spur momentum for Mr. Biden’s broader political agenda, the opposite is also true: Failing to slow the spread of Covid-19 could also overshadow his presidency.<br />“Dealing with Covid and the economic recovery is the thing that will make the presidency in the next two years and into the 2022 election,” said Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University.<br />“If it doesn’t get better,” said Mr. Blendon, “people are going to hold the administration accountable.”<br />Mr. Biden’s national strategy announced Thursday is part of a blizzard of activity to curb the virus in his first 100 days, including a federal mask mandate, the administration of 100 million vaccines, the establishment of 100 federally supported vaccination centers, and reopening of most kindergarten-through-eighth-grade schools.</td>

      <td>Companies say they operated in accordance with laws and regulations, and followed regulatory requirements of listing venues</td>
      <td>China’s big telecom carriers asked the New York Stock Exchange to rethink their planned delisting, the latest twist in a to-and-fro about whether they should be allowed to trade in U.S. markets.<br />In separate filings Thursday morning in Hong Kong,  China Mobile Ltd. ,  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd.  and  China Telecom Corp.  said they had filed requests asking the NYSE to reverse its decision to delist their American depositary receipts. They said they had asked if a trading halt on their ADRs could be lifted in the meantime.<br />The requests came hours after Joe Biden was sworn in as the new U.S. president. Mr. Biden signed 15 executive orders and two executive actions on his first day in office, reversing some of former President Trump’s key policies.<br />In November, Mr. Trump signed an order barring Americans from investing in a list of Chinese companies that the U.S. said supplied and otherwise supported China’s military, intelligence and security services. The order bans U.S. investors from buying blacklisted securities from Jan. 11, and gives them until Nov. 11 to shed their holdings.<br />While these three telecoms’ parent companies, which aren’t publicly traded, are covered by the ban, it was initially unclear if the listed groups were also included. This month, the NYSE first said it would delist the trio, then changed its mind, then decided it would delist them after all.</td>

      <td>BYD Co. , a Chinese car maker backed by Warren Buffett, raised $3.9 billion from a stock sale, joining peers in capitalizing on investors’ bullishness about new-energy vehicles.<br />The deal marks BYD’s biggest equity financing since it listed in Hong Kong in 2002. The company, whose stock also trades in Shenzhen, makes electric cars, batteries, plug-in hybrids and fossil-fuel-powered vehicles.<br />Investor enthusiasm about green cars and breakthroughs in battery technology have sent the company’s stock soaring, making it more attractive for BYD to raise new funds. BYD stock in Hong Kong has more than quintupled in a year, giving it a market capitalization of $91 billion. That is roughly in line with  NIO Inc.,  a newer Chinese rival, and compares to an $806 billion market cap for  Tesla Inc.,  according to FactSet.<br />Other electric-car makers have also tapped equity markets for funds as they race to secure a bigger slice of the growing sector. Chinese competitor  Xpeng Inc.  in December raised $2.5 billion from a follow-on offering of American depositary receipts, while NIO has raised more than $4.5 billion in December and January by selling ADRs and convertible bonds.<br />A unit of  Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  has held a stake in BYD since 2008. As of June 2020, Berkshire held 8.25% of BYD, or nearly 25% of its Hong Kong-listed stock, according to BYD’s half-year report.</td>

The recorder, which is one of the plane’s two black boxes, was retrieved a few days after the crash.<br />The data indicates the so-called autothrottle system—which automatically adjusts fuel flow and thrust to maintain the path set by pilots—wasn’t operating properly on one engine at some point during the Boeing 737-500’s climb away from the nation’s capital, Jakarta, on Jan. 9, according to some of the people familiar with the matter.<br />Instead of shutting off the system, they said, the flight-data recorder indicates pilots tried to get the stuck throttle to function. Such engine-control malfunctions can create significant differences in power between engines, making a twin-engine jet harder to control and it could potentially distract pilots from maintaining a safe flight.<br />Twin-engine aircraft such as the 737 are designed to fly safely on a single engine and pilots are trained to do that in various situations. But large differences in thrust between engines, according to pilots and safety experts, require swift pilot recognition of the problem, which would ideally be followed by quick responses and manual commands.</td>

In that role, he helped craft the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping overhaul of financial regulation that followed the 2008-09 financial crisis.<br />The White House declined to comment, and the Treasury Department didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mr. Barr, who is currently dean of public policy at the University of Michigan, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.<br />It was unclear when the White House would announce the nomination. Mr. Barr would succeed Brian Brooks, who stepped down last week after about eight months as the Trump administration’s acting comptroller.<br />Mr. Barr would join Mr. Biden’s prospective regulatory team alongside Rohit Chopra, the president’s likely pick to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Gary Gensler, the nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is an independent bureau of the Treasury Department, which would be headed by Mr. Biden’s nominee as secretary, Janet Yellen.</td>

Starboard is aiming to oust Corteva Chief Executive Jim Collins over what the activist says is mediocre performance. It has an unnamed replacement in mind.<br />Corteva, which was part of DowDuPont before it was spun out of the industrial conglomerate in 2019, is one of the world’s largest sellers of seeds and pesticides, with a market value of $33 billion.<br />In October, Starboard disclosed a roughly 1.6% stake in Wilmington, Del.-based Corteva. Mr. Smith said in a presentation at the time that the company’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were little-changed from when it was formed in 2019, lagging behind peers.<br />In response to a question about that criticism on Corteva’s earnings call in November, Mr. Collins said he agrees the business has room to improve its margins. “Probably the only question in that whole discussion is our view of the timing of that improvement,” he said.</td>

      <td>On his way out the door Wednesday, President Trump granted a long list of pardons and commutations, and it’s a mix of the reasonable, the unseemly and the egregious. Here’s looking at you, Steve Bannon.<br />Of 143 people granted clemency, many are drug offenders. To pick a commutation, Isaac Nelson served more than half of his mandatory 20 years for crimes involving at least five kilograms of cocaine and 50 grams of crack, the White House said. Under the First Step Act, signed in 2018, “he would likely face a 10-year sentence.”<br />Some of the drug crimes are no small matter, since they appear to involve trafficking literally tons of marijuana, plus laundering millions of dollars, which is a business that can turn violent fast. Yet public attitudes toward marijuana have shifted. Determining that a sentence was excessive is a judgment call, which is why a President has broad clemency discretion.<br />Less admirable is the pardon for Duke Cunningham, the former Congressman who’s no longer in prison, but who betrayed his constituents by taking bribes. Ditto on the commutation for Salomon Melgen, a big Democratic donor caught up in the probe of Sen. Robert Menendez. Dr. Melgen was given a 17-year sentence for defrauding Medicare of $42 million.<br />Mr. Trump, thankfully, didn’t pardonEdward Snowden. But why pardon Mr. Bannon? He was charged with fleecing Trump supporters in a scheme to build a private wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. The fund raised $25 million, the indictment says, and donors were told every penny would go to the project.</td>

No one took a knee when Lady Gaga sang the national anthem.<br />And it was especially moving, at least to us, to see new Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband walk down the Capitol steps escorting Mike Pence and his wife to their waiting car. Mr. Pence in particular deserved this traditional show of respect after his role on Jan. 6 when he refused to reject the state electoral votes as President Trump demanded. He should be getting more praise than he is for that display of constitutional principle.<br />These rituals send a message to a diverse country, and to the world, about America’s fundamental institutional strength despite a bitter election campaign and the turmoil of recent weeks. In China the transfers of power are from one Communist Party cadre to another, and public political rites are limited to unanimous acclamation. Enemies have often misjudged America’s raucous politics for national weakness—to their eventual regret.<br />Mr. Biden struck many good notes in an Inaugural Address that will be remembered more for its moment following the Capitol riot than for its words. The speech had a personal flavor with touches of his Catholicism, such as quoting St. Augustine and praying for the dead. In this and in other personal manners, the new President is refreshingly unwoke.</td>

      <td>China’s projection of power isn’t only a regional concern. It will eventually pose a threat to the U.S.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration’s Middle East policy will reportedly focus on rejoining the Iran nuclear deal and renewing Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. This could undermine key allies in Israel and Saudi Arabia while ignoring a core geopolitical challenge that few in Washington are addressing: growing Chinese influence in the Middle East.<br />Through its trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, China has invested in a port near the Persian Gulf in Gwadar, Pakistan, and a military base by the entrance to the Red Sea at Djibouti. The Chinese also envision a military base at Port Sudan, further north on the Red Sea, and a naval facility at Jiwani, Pakistan, on the Iranian border. Then there are the new Israeli port facilities at Haifa and Ashdod, which the Chinese will likely be administering. Afghanistan could one day become a branch line for the Belt and Road corridor from western China through Pakistan to the Arabian Sea. China is the largest trading partner for both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. China is investing billions of dollars in Egypt and more billions as part of a strategic pact with Iran.<br />Unlike many in Washington, who separate regions in order of perceived importance, Chinese strategists think organically about geography. They recognize that in a smaller, more interconnected and confining world, regions and continents work together and flow into each other. Thus, the Chinese know that the road, railway and port system they are building across the Middle East will one day give them a strong hand in Europe and East Asia—not to mention East Africa.<br />Beijing doesn’t take sides. China is happy to work with Iran, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Rather than promote a liberal vision—or any vision—the Chinese are remorselessly mercantile and imperial in their approach. It’s all about money and transportation links: classical geography fitted to a postmodern world.<br />For centuries British foreign policy was aimed at preventing any one power from dominating continental Europe. Similarly, American foreign policy should now aim at preventing any one power from dominating Afro-Eurasia—what the great British geographer Halford Mackinder labeled the “World-Island.” By linking Europe with East Asia through the Middle East, China would eventually develop the ability to threaten North America economically and militarily. This is ultimately what Belt and Road is all about. The Biden administration must focus on stopping it.</td>

      <td>How to keep working-class Trump voters while winning back support in the suburbs?</td>
      <td>President Joe Biden’s inauguration marks not only a new administration’s beginning but also a new chapter for the loyal opposition.<br />The Grand Old Party lost the White House while picking up U.S. House seats, holding half the Senate, and adding to its numbers in state legislative chambers. These conflicting outcomes leave Republicans facing the difficult task of cementing blue-collar Trump voters into their ranks while regaining strength in the suburbs and making inroads with an increasingly diverse electorate.<br />To rebuild, Republicans must decide what their party stands for. The way forward begins with clarifying what the GOP’s answers should be to the nation’s challenges, with an eye to the 2022 elections.<br />This won’t be easy. Tensions between the party’s various elements are difficult to navigate, but it’s important to remember that President Donald Trump’s most popular achievements were conservative: originalist judges, a pro-growth tax cut, regulatory relief, strong national defense, recognition of the global threat posed by China, secure borders, and respect for life and religious liberty.<br />GOP officeholders, candidates and party leaders should offer ideas that apply timeless conservative principles to America’s changing circumstances. As Republicans oppose the Biden administration’s agenda, they should contrast their new initiatives with the Democrats’ approach. The key is to remember that what they’re for is as important as what they’re against. The values underlying Republican initiatives are crucial, too. There are more conservatives in America who believe in traditional values, family, faith, personal responsibility, patriotism and law and order than there are liberals who don’t.</td>

      <td>Americans don’t like the idea of a national identity card. But in an era of intense controversies over election integrity and illegal immigration, it is time to rethink the subject.<br />Our views on national identity documents trace back to the British. When the U.S. was founded, immigration was largely unregulated, and people knew their neighbors, so voting was secure.<br />We are now in a crisis in which many people lack confidence in the integrity of elections. Some of these fears are unfounded, but in 2020 unsolicited mailing of ballots and abandoning of signature checks on mail ballots provided the basis for skepticism far beyond the concerns of prior years. Restoring trust in elections is crucial to the country’s unity.<br />Republicans have long pushed for in-person voting using government-issued photo ID. Democrats have opposed such a system on grounds that the poor are less likely to have such identification. But if everyone had a national identity card and presented it when voting, we could have full enfranchisement with full integrity.<br />Immigration could also benefit from a national ID card. In 1986 Congress enacted a grand compromise in which amnesty for illegal aliens was paired with discouraging further illegal immigration by mandating checks of immigration status for people being hired. Such checks failed because no identity system was in place; the result was amnesty with a surge of new illegal immigration.</td>

      <td>Nasdaq wants to mandate wider representation on its companies’ boards but has little proof of the benefits.</td>
      <td>Corporate directors are called on to do a few important things: Hire a CEO and oversee management, provide strategic direction, protect and promote the interests of investors, and ensure the company’s books are honest. Now, many claim, directors should also represent the country’s demographics.<br />That is the upshot of a requirement by one of America’s largest financial markets. Nasdaq is calling for all its listed companies to appoint within the next four years no fewer than two “diverse” directors: at least one woman, and one person from an underrepresented racial or ethnic group or someone who identifies as LGBTQ. Any company failing this requirement would be obligated to explain why. This new standard now faces approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br />It would be tempting for the SEC, soon to be led by a Biden appointee, to approve the proposal. Many of the calls for diversity requirements on board membership and recruitment are being made by large asset managers and institutional investors. The SEC could conceivably approve it in the name of investor-led democracy.<br />But that would be shortsighted. For one thing, diversity requirements are political at their core and, in my experience, any securities regulation that feeds the base instincts of political partisanship will inevitably be undone by the opposing party when it has the chance, or face challenges in the courts. Regulation that is enduring and sustainable—on any issue—requires the SEC’s expert analysis, professional moderation and careful review.<br />The issue of diversity on boards is also emotional, and it often creates more heat than light. Both sides have plenty of anecdotes to draw from. I have stacks of annual reports from boards with members who are all white, all male, all over 50—and quite mediocre. At the same time, I have seen women or minorities whose membership on corporate boards was forgettable at best. There is no guarantee of competence in a director based on sex or skin color.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Businesses prepared for an era of stricter regulation Wednesday as President Biden ordered a review of dozens of environmental policies—foreshadowing more stringent efficiency requirements for auto makers and appliance manufacturers, new limits on mining and drilling on federal lands and tougher emissions standards for power plants.<br />The actions were aimed at reversing former President Donald Trump’s deregulatory push in environmental regulation, prompting optimism among many executives backing renewable technologies, but irking others.<br />Fossil-fuel companies are likely to be among Mr. Biden’s biggest opponents. Mike Sommers, president and chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, used his annual address last week to strike a conciliatory tone at times, saying it wanted to work with Mr. Biden on emissions limits and trade policy.<br />But he also said the group would aggressively defend the industry on core interests, especially access to federal lands and offshore oil.<br />“The bottom line for us is that we are going to work with the Biden administration when we can, but we will oppose them when we must,” Mr. Sommers said. “We will do everything we can to fight for the oil-and-gas industry across the United States.”</td>

      <td>While we celebrate that the death rate from cancer in the U.S. dropped 2.4% from 2017 to 2018 and that the cancer mortality rate has fallen 31% since its peak in 1991 (“Cancer Death Rate in 2018 Fell By the Largest-Ever Yearly Amount,” U.S. News, Jan. 13), Covid-19 is having a negative effect on cancer prevention and early detection.<br />The Prevent Cancer Foundation’s research shows a significant portion of adults are missing or postponing scheduled cancer screenings, and African-Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately affected. And let’s not forget that 20% of parents are missing their children’s scheduled vaccinations to protect against serious diseases—including the HPV vaccine, which can prevent at least six types of cancer.<br />We know that in the coming months and years, preventable deaths from cancer will increase. Now isn’t the time to be complacent. With screening, cancer can be prevented or detected early to dramatically improve patient outcomes. Americans need to keep routine cancer screenings appointments or reschedule the ones they have missed.<br />We are encouraging people to get their cancer screenings back on the books and talk to their health-care providers about the safety precautions that are in place so they can feel comfortable keeping those appointments. Breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, oral, prostate and skin cancer screenings are important to prevent cancer or detect it early. These screenings save lives.<br />Thank you for elevating awareness on the importance of screenings and options available to patients. We are making tremendous advances in the fight against cancer. By getting doctors’ appointments back on the books, we can save lives.</td>

Lewis’s “Upping the Waiting Game—Moynihan Train Hall, the expansion of Penn Station, imbues rail travel with some grandeur” (Arts in Review, Jan. 14) affirms the importance of proactivity and innovation when skeptics are writing cities off.<br />Moynihan’s success should be a starting point for broadening our thinking to include the entire region. At ReThinkNYC, we believe there is a once-in-a-century opportunity to unlock this region’s upside potential, including New York City proper, by unifying the transit network centered on a rethought and rebuilt above-ground Penn Station, like the original, across from the Moynihan. This will address Mr. Lewis’s concern that the Moynihan will be an “orphan” until the train lines are “organically integrated” and their century-old “piecemeal accretion” is put behind us. New or expanded transit hubs in Sunnyside, Queens, Secaucus and the Bronx would expand the region’s core to reduce car traffic, allow for fluid intraregional access to housing and the job market and add economic relevance to such places as Newark, Paterson and Jamaica, Queens. We would recreate a modernized, yet faithful, version of the original high-ceilinged naturally lighted McKim, Mead and White Penn Station, attracting ridership and maximizing positive economic activity. London’s acclaimed conversion of the St. Pancras station is an apt precedent.<br />Our proposals affirm the approach to streetscape and scale that Jane Jacobs, who actively protested the original Penn Station’s destruction, found so important in cities. Our hope is to help the region move beyond the auto-centric approach to land-use and funding decisions that, as Robert Caro pointed out in “The Power Broker,” impeded the quality of life in the tristate region for decades and, sadly, continues to do so today.<br />Samuel Turvey<br />Chairperson, ReThinkNYC</td>

After the European Union’s drugs agency ruled on Jan. 8 that six doses could be obtained from a vial, the companies cut the number of vials delivered, arguing that their contract was for a certain amount of doses, not vials. The companies have said they were on schedule to deliver the number of doses they had promised.<br />A Hamburg government spokeswoman said the state has struggled to extract the sixth dose as special syringes are required and authorities haven’t been able to purchase them in sufficient quantities.

      <td>An interactive tour of the empty Vatican Museums offers the chance to experience the Sistine Chapel and other Renaissance treasures without the crowds.</td>
      <td>Typically, the Vatican Museums are a source of both pleasure and frustration. Amid the throngs, it can be impossible to achieve any kind of contemplative state to allow real absorption of their many artistic treasures. While we are limited to armchair travel because of Covid-19, the impressive virtual visits offered by the Vatican Museums create the pleasurable sensation of seeing these typically crowded halls all alone. Digital tourism also allows you to see a few of the many rooms normally closed to the public, such as the Niccoline Chapel with frescoes by Fra Angelico (1395-1455).<br />All told, there are 26 distinct areas within the Vatican, ranging from the Pinacoteca or painting gallery; to unexpected troves such as the Jewish Lapidarium, containing inscriptions from the Jewish catacomb of Monteverde; and the ethnological collection, spanning works from Africa to China and Latin America, primarily the product of missionary work. The Vatican Museums website offers unusual accessibility to all of them—with a short introductory video, text and photographs and, in many cases, virtual tours.<br />Among the most stunning opportunities these tours create is to see each of Raphael’s four Stanze, a suite of rooms created for popes Julius II (1503-13) and Leo X (1513-21), as one rarely can in person. On walls and ceilings, Raphael depicted historical and philosophical allegories, complex subjects glorifying the history of the papacy as well as forging connections between the Christian and classical, pre-Christian civilizations.<br />In the the Stanza della Segnatura (1508-11), the magnificent fictive architecture of Raphael’s “The School of Athens”—with its expansive vault referring both to ancient ruins such as the Basilica of Maxentius and to ambitious new constructions then under way, such as St. Peter’s—is engrossing in itself. So are the varied attitudes and poses of that fresco’s ancient philosophers and mathematicians—the work includes portraits of Bramante as Euclid and Michelangelo as the famously ill-tempered philosopher Heraclitus.<br />But if one looks immediately across from it, as the 360-degree photography allows you to do, you may notice that Raphael has created an implied visual continuity of the pavement from “The School of Athens” into the fresco opposite, known as the “Disputa.” Above the ground plane, where popes and church fathers congregate, Raphael creates a platform of clouds, surmounted by Old Testament prophets interspersed with martyrs, saints and apostles. While “The School of Athens” represents the entirety of classical knowledge, the “Disputa” represents theological knowledge in two realms, on earth and in the heavens. The conversation Raphael creates across the room bridges the two worlds of the sacred and the secular, part of the larger effort advanced by Julius’s papacy.</td>

Another category of individuals who are eligible to serve as acting officials are those who have served as an “officer or employee” of the same agency for at least 90 days during the preceding year, at a senior-level pay scale.<br />Acting secretaries have the same powers as Senate-confirmed secretaries but are limited by law to serving 210 days. At the start of an administration, acting secretaries are allowed to serve an additional 90 days. And if there is a pending nomination, federal law permits an even longer term of service.<br />Nevertheless, organizations promoting good governance say it is critical to effective government to have Senate-confirmed nominees in place as soon as possible.</td>

      <td>THE AMERICAN fashion industry is suddenly abuzz again. For today’s inauguration, President Joe Biden, first lady Dr. Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff have all chosen to wear the work of American designers or labels, including Ralph Lauren, Christopher John Rogers and Markarian. “These moments on Day One are so important for an industry that’s been so hard hit and impacted by the pandemic,” said Steven Kolb, chief executive officer of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. “By wearing these American designers, they’re not only boosting the business of those individuals, but they’re really boosting the $373 billion industry...We have a new administration that clearly is welcoming and wants to be supportive of our industry.”<br />Consciously or not, the color purple—which can be seen as symbolically marrying red and blue—is also a theme, with Ms. Harris, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama all favoring the color for today’s ceremony.<br />For today’s inauguration, the incoming first lady Dr. Biden wore a custom blue wool-tweed dress, coat and matching face mask by New York brand Markarian, which is designed by Alexandra O’Neill. Ms. Harris wore a regal purple coat and dress by Christopher John Rogers, a Black New York designer known for his striking use of color. Mr. Rogers was recently in the spotlight for crafting the structured blue suit worn by Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez in Vanity Fair’s December 2020 cover story on the congresswoman. Ms. Obama, whose fashion choices as first lady were breathlessly covered by the media and in the case of J.Crew, boosted sales of certain items, also chose a Black American designer for today’s inauguration. The former first lady wore a burgundy ensemble by Sergio Hudson.<br />At a pre-inauguration coronavirus memorial event last night, Dr. Biden and Ms. Harris also made strong statements in their choice of designer. Dr. Biden wore a purple dress, coat and a mask from emerging New York designer Jonathan Cohen, whose parents are Mexican. Ms. Harris wore a custom camel coat by Pyer Moss, a label founded by Kerby Jean-Raymond, a socially conscious Black designer of Haitian descent.<br />Ms. Harris’s stepdaughter Ella Emhoff, an art student with an interest in fashion, has gotten buzz on social media for her experimental looks. Yesterday she wore a cutting-edge skirt suit and tie by the American designer Thom Browne. For the inauguration, she wore a plaid embellished coat by Italian label Miu Miu.</td>

      <td>Kamala Harris made history Wednesday as the first woman to be sworn in as vice president, alongside her husband, Doug Emhoff, who will become the first second gentleman.<br />Ms. Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, will also be the first Black vice president and first of Indian descent. In her role, she will serve as a counselor to President Biden and as the tiebreaker in an evenly divided Senate.<br />Ms. Harris, 56 years old, was sworn in on two Bibles: one that belonged to Regina Shelton, whom Ms. Harris considers a second mother, and one that belonged to Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black Supreme Court justice, who inspired Ms. Harris to pursue law. Ms. Harris also used Ms. Shelton’s Bible when she was sworn in as California’s attorney general and U.S. senator. Ms. Shelton helped take care of Ms. Harris and her sister while their mother worked when they were growing up.<br />Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice, was selected by Ms. Harris to officiate her swearing-in ceremony. She was escorted inside the Capitol by U.S. Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, a Black officer who redirected a mostly white mob away from lawmakers as they were being evacuated during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.<br />For some in attendance, watching Ms. Harris’s historic achievement was personal.</td>
