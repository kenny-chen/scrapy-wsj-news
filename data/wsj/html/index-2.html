      <td>New report gives first concrete insight into impact of alleged sabotage in April at nation’s main nuclear facility</td>
      <td>Iran’s production of nuclear fuel plunged in recent weeks, the United Nations atomic agency reported on Monday, following alleged sabotage of its main nuclear facility in April that Tehran has blamed on Israel.<br />The drop in production, detailed in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s confidential report circulated Monday, gives the first substantive insight into the impact of the incident, which took out the power supply at Natanz and destroyed potentially hundreds of centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium.<br />Israel has declined to comment on the incident, one of several at Iran’s nuclear facilities over the last 18 months. Tehran accused Israel at the time of orchestrating the attack to undermine the start of talks in Vienna involving Iran and the U.S. aimed at restoring the 2015 nuclear deal. Former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal in 2018.<br />Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium increased by an estimated 273 kilograms in the three months ending May 22, the IAEA said, just over half the 525 kg stockpile increase in the previous quarter. The Natanz incident happened April 11, halfway through the reporting period.<br />The agency also reported that on May 24, there were 20 cascades of centrifuges working at the fuel enrichment plant at Natanz, a sharp decrease from before the April incident.</td>

      <td>Israel may get a new government, but don’t expect a left turn.</td>
      <td>Western democracies produce all manner of governments: Left- or right-wing, centrist, populist. But the new government taking shape in Israel defies categorization. If negotiations go through as planned, Israel could soon be led by a religious-nationalist Prime Minister backed by a centrist dealmaker, with the support of Arab and leftist parties.<br />American liberals will surely celebrate the departure of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has come to symbolize the Democratic Party’s rift with Israel over the last decade. But it would be a mistake to interpret it as a rejection of Israel’s rightward political and security direction, which the new government is likely to maintain.<br />The unusual coalition is coming together after Israelis went to the polls four times since 2019, most recently this March. Though his security policies had wide support, Mr. Netanyahu—who has been Prime Minister since 2009—was unable to form a majority coalition from among Israel’s 13 fractious parties.<br />The conventional wisdom this month said Hamas had given Mr. Netanyahu a new political lease on life by launching its rocket assault on Israel, elevating the security issue that built Mr. Netanyahu’s career. Yet a week after the fighting stopped, Naftali Bennett of the conservative Yamina party announced that he would accept an offer from the centrist Yair Lapid to form a government without Mr. Netanyahu. Under the agreement, Mr. Bennett will be Prime Minister immediately, with Mr. Lapid taking over in 2023, if the government lasts that long.<br />Mr. Bennett served as Mr. Netanyahu’s chief of staff in the 2000s and has since largely criticized him from the right. He is a longtime champion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, explicitly rejects a two-state solution and has urged tougher military action against the terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. Territorial concessions with a government that depends on his support would be impossible.</td>

      <td>Joe Biden says it’s ‘an assault on democracy.’ The facts say otherwise.</td>
      <td>As the Texas legislative session drew near its end Sunday, lawmakers appeared set to pass a bill overhauling the state’s elections, until Democrats did one final maneuver: They snuck out of the building. “Members, take your key and leave the chamber discreetly,” a Democratic leader in the state House told his caucus in a 10:35 p.m. text message.<br />The extraordinary move deprived the House of a quorum, killing the bill for now, at the cost of undermining the legislative process. But what do you expect after months of Democratic alarms about “voter suppression”? President Biden on Saturday called the Texas plan “un-American” and “part of an assault on democracy.” At least this time he didn’t say it’s worse than Jim Crow, which was the political bomb he lobbed at Georgia’s bill.<br />The reality is more prosaic. To start with the controversial, the 67-page bill would roll back Covid-19 innovations like Harris County’s drive-through voting and 24-hour voting. Those options were used disproportionately last year by black and Hispanic residents. But when did emergency procedures amid a 100-year pandemic suddenly become the new baseline? It’s hardly crazy to think polling-place shenanigans might be more likely at 3 a.m.<br />The bill says that on the last Sunday of early voting, polling places may not open until 1 p.m. This is a political mistake, at minimum, in that it’s being spun as an attack on black churches that have a “souls to the polls” tradition. One lawmaker supporting the bill argued: “Those election workers want to go to church, too.” But some people take care of their religious obligations on Saturdays, and in any event Texas repealed most of its blue laws in 1985. Lawmakers would be wise to drop this provision.<br />Under the bill, Texas would still offer some two weeks of early voting. Mr. Biden’s beloved Delaware won’t have any early voting until 2022, when it will get 10 days. The Texas bill would also raise minimum hours. In the final week, counties with 100,000 people must currently open their “main” polling place 12 hours on weekdays and five hours on Sunday. That population threshold would drop to 30,000, and six hours would be mandated on Sunday.</td>

      <td>The State Department is supposed to advance U.S. interests and burnish the country’s image abroad.</td>
      <td>American diplomats take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. A foreign-service officer’s job is to advance American interests. But officials are now asking diplomats to function as social-justice warriors to the detriment of the country’s image abroad, as revealed by a leaked State Department cable encouraging embassies and consulates to fly Black Lives Matter flags.<br />Nearly 20 years ago, when I was sworn in as a foreign-service officer by Secretary of State Colin Powell, he said: “The most important of all the jobs that we are sending you out to do is to take with you the value system of the American people.” BLM’s values are shared by only half the country, if that, according to a recent USA Today/Ipsos poll. Another USA Today survey indicated that only 18% of Americans and 28% of blacks support the group’s signature goal, defunding the police.<br />Yet from reading the State Department’s May 21 cable, you’d think the country is in lockstep agreement. The cable asserts that protests in the wake of George Floyd’s killing “sparked a movement to confront systems perpetuating deep-seated inequities rooted in colonialism and the oppression of racial, tribal, ethnic, and other minority communities.” It continues: “Mr. Floyd’s murder prompted an international outcry to seek racial justice and equity by dismantling systemic racism and eradicating police brutality affecting communities of color, most acutely, people of African descent.” The missive asserted that federal law allows diplomats to “engage in BLM-related activity while on duty or in the workplace” but not to combine such advocacy with “political activity.”<br />That’s doublespeak. BLM activity is political advocacy. The group’s co-founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors is a self-described Marxist. Until recently, BLM’s website called on “comrades” to make efforts at “dismantling cisgender privilege and heteronormative thinking” and “disrupting the Western prescribed nuclear family structure requirement.”<br />The site still claims that “police were born out of slave patrols” and features a list of “demands” that include defunding police, barring Donald Trump from holding office or using social media, and “expelling” more than half of the Republicans in Congress for stoking “Trump’s conspiracy theories and encouraging the white supremacists to take action to overturn the election.”</td>

      <td>Biden wisely changes his position on an accord Russia openly violated.</td>
      <td>Much could go wrong when President Biden sits down with Vladimir Putin in Geneva on June 16. But at least one bad policy has been ruled out: The U.S. won’t try to revive the Open Skies Treaty.<br />“In concluding its review of the treaty, the United States therefore does not intend to seek to rejoin it, given Russia’s failure to take any actions to return to compliance,” a State Department statement said last week. “Further, Russia’s behavior, including its recent actions with respect to Ukraine, is not that of a partner committed to confidence-building.”<br />The 1992 accord—which allowed the U.S., Russia and European states to conduct surveillance flights over each other—is a relic of the optimism that accompanied the downfall of the Soviet Union. The treaty was theoretically useful in creating military transparency. But these kinds of agreements only work when the parties operate in good faith.<br />Despite some post-Cold War hope, Russia never transformed into a responsible international player. It blocked legitimate Western flights over its territory while using the treaty to gain intelligence about American sites. Even if Mr. Putin fully complied, the treaty still tilted in his favor: American surveillance technology outpaces Russian abilities, making the flights more useful to Moscow than Washington.<br />When Donald Trump announced he would leave the treaty in May 2020, Mr. Biden called the decision a “short-sighted policy of going it alone and abandoning American leadership.” He warned this would “increase the risks of miscalculation and conflict” while alienating Europeans who wanted the U.S. to stay.</td>

      <td>It isn’t awareness the West lacks but a clear strategy to reverse the rising, bloody tide.</td>
      <td>It’s been a big week for genocide apologies. On Friday, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas asked Namibia and the descendants of its Herero and Nama peoples to forgive Germany for actions that “from today’s perspective” were a “genocide.” After bloodily crushing a revolt against colonial rule, in the 1900s German authorities confined Herero and Nama in concentration camps, where a majority of inmates are believed to have died of starvation and illness. In many cases, the tribal land Germany confiscated—the taking of which triggered the rebellion—is still held by settlers’ descendants today. Berlin’s apology came with a pledge of €1.1 billion (around $1.3 billion) for development and reconstruction projects over the next 30 years as recompense.<br />Meanwhile in Rwanda Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron acknowledged France’s “terrible responsibility” in the 1994 genocide, but without offering a formal apology or financial compensation. French forces played no direct role in the attacks that killed hundreds of thousands of Rwandans, but as Mr. Macron acknowledged, they supported the “genocidal regime” that carried out the murders. A French inquiry acknowledged in March what had been well-known to observers for decades: “French officials armed, advised, trained, equipped, and protected” the Rwandan government that prepared and carried out one of the most horrific actions by any non-Communist government since World War II.<br />The apologizers, as usual, seem less enthusiastic at their tasks than the genocidaires were in theirs. A representative of the Herero people denounced the German apology and compensation offer as “a total insult to our intelligence” and vowed to “fight to hell and back” against closing the books on the German colonial atrocities. The leading Rwandan genocide survivor group expressed disappointment that Macron didn’t offer “a clear apology.”<br />The problem for apologetic states in part is a legal one. Germans don’t want to set a precedent in Namibia that would strengthen the case of, for example, Greeks who demand close to €300 billion as compensation for Nazi crimes in World War II. Similar concerns have dogged Japan’s efforts to resolve the issue of crimes against Koreans during the era of colonial rule, which ended in 1945. Apologies carefully vetted by lawyers rarely sound truly heartfelt.<br />But if genocide apologizers are having an active year, genocidaires are even busier. Walking through my neighborhood in Washington earlier this spring I saw a crowd of people shouting “Stop the Genocide!” and it took me a few minutes to figure which contemporary atrocity they had in mind.</td>

      <td>New York<br />Nearly 30 people were shot in New York City on a single weekend in May. Citywide, shootings are up approximately 80% since the beginning of the year, and murders have increased more than 20%.<br />It is naive to think we can make the city safer by removing resources from the New York Police City Department. But it’s also true we can’t continue the current approach to fighting crime. Increasing police presence in high-crime areas is a critical component of responding to the violence affecting our city, but it is not a complete solution. We must confront this crime wave with specialized policing while also addressing the underlying social inequalities.<br />Some of my opponents in the race for mayor suggest a return to blunt-force tactics, such as stop-and-frisk, that perpetuated racial discrimination and stereotypes. In 2011, the peak of stop-and-frisk, police made 685,724 stops. Of those stopped, 87% were black or Latino, and 88% were innocent, according to an analysis of NYPD data from the New York Civil Liberties Union. The police are supposed to protect communities, not profile them.<br />Instead, the NYPD’s acute intelligence and investigative capabilities, which have resulted in record gun arrests—a 64% increase in February compared with the same time last year—should continue in communities facing runaway gun violence. We must also disrupt the influx of illegal guns and embed specially trained officers in the highest-crime areas to take on criminal networks.</td>

      <td>A series of evolutionary ‘trade offs’ means that even healthy bodies operate at the edge of acceptable performance, predictably prone to fail.</td>
      <td>In Voltaire’s “Candide,” the protagonist’s servant asks his master to explain the meaning of optimism. To which his master replies: “It is the mania for insisting that all is well when all is by no means well.” There is perhaps no more perfect description of the human condition, as all is manifestly not well. How could it be? From the moment of our inception, a silent biological clock begins the countdown to the end of our existence. Our genome contrives to mutate itself into a smorgasbord of potential pathologies, each capable of corrupting and unraveling us. We respond with attempts to medicate and therapize ourselves, to correct the built-in flaws and shining imperfections that make us so irresistibly human.<br />In Alex Bezzerides’s entertaining “Evolution Gone Wrong: The Curious Reasons Why Our Bodies Work (or Don’t),” the author’s quest is to determine the origins of the “aches and pains of the masses and why they happen”—not the mechanical causes of our maladies but the evolutionary ones. The explanation, Mr. Bezzerides concludes, may be found in our anatomical shortcomings—“trade-offs” made during our continuing evolutionary history. The result is that even healthy bodies operate at the edge of acceptable performance, while also being prone to fail in predictable ways.<br />The catalog of human fallibilities that Mr. Bezzerides assembles begins with an account of our suboptimal dentition. For many individuals, the textbook display of 32 neatly arrayed teeth, systematically configured to produce a perfect Hollywood smile, is at best hopeful and more frequently fictional. Reality more typically involves a procession of braces, extractions and eccentric protrusions. So why don’t our teeth fit into our mouths?<br />The answer, according to Mr. Bezzerides, is that four million years ago our ancestors transitioned from a fruit- and leaves-based diet to one of grasses and sedges. Their molars ballooned out to gargantuan proportions, which was not at first problematic, since their substantive jaws readily accommodated the newly enlarged teeth. But as humans controlled fire, learned to cook, became cooperative, and developed hunting techniques and an accompanying armamentarium of cutting implements, the requirement for robust dentition diminished. We were nevertheless stuck with the legacy of “a mouth full of large teeth.” Jaw and tooth size subsequently began to decrease, yet the distinct genetic programs controlling each led to a disconnect between their relative rates of reduction. While the human jaw enthusiastically embraced its “great shrink,” tooth-size reduction struggled to keep up. Hence the modern tooth-jaw mismatch.<br />Our imperfectly functioning eyes suffer similarly from constraints imposed by our distant evolutionary history. More than half of European adults have visual defects, while a quarter of U.S. children require visual correction. The problem, according to Mr. Bezzerides, is that the eyes of our vertebrate ancestors evolved to function underwater. When vertebrates first moved onto land 375 million years ago, their eyes had already existed for more than 100 million years. The reconfiguration of such established biological hardware was not trivial, leaving us with short-sightedness and a range of oddities, including the need to blink up to 14,000 times a day while deploying a Coke can full of lubricating tears.</td>

The number of symptomatic cases fell 80%, and hospitalizations related to the disease dropped 86%, the study’s researchers said.<br />Butantan said the mass vaccination campaign had curbed transmission of the disease in the town, also reducing cases and deaths among those who weren’t vaccinated, including minors under 18 and adults with serious health problems who couldn’t take the shot. More than 95% of the town’s eligible adults agreed to take CoronaVac as part of the experiment.</td>

      <td>PARIS—Women’s tennis world No. 2 Naomi Osaka withdrew from the French Open on Monday, dramatically concluding a standoff over her decision not to grant interviews during the tournament, which she had attributed to caring for her mental health.<br />Osaka, the highest-earning female athlete in the world and a winner of four major titles, had touched off the debate over the weekend and is now leaving Paris before even playing the second round. In her exit, she revealed a long-running struggle with depression and cast doubt on the rest of her season.<br />Osaka had already been fined $15,000 by the Roland-Garros organizers for failing to appear in a mandatory news conference after her first-round victory here on Sunday. (She still answered three questions on the court and honored a long-standing agreement with a Japanese broadcaster.)<br />“I never wanted to be a distraction and I accept that my timing was not ideal and my message could have been clearer,” she wrote in a statement posted to her social media accounts. “More importantly I would never trivialize mental health or use the term lightly. The truth is that I have suffered long bouts of depression since the U.S. Open in 2018 and I have had a really hard time coping with that.”<br />Osaka, who was raised primarily in the U.S. and represents Japan, had stunned the French Open shortly after landing in Paris when she informed organizers that she would not be carrying out her media duties during the tournament, because she “often felt that people have no regard for athletes’ mental health.”</td>

      <td>Eye doctors say they’re seeing more children with new or worsening vision problems. Increased screen time, they believe, bears part of the blame.</td>
      <td>Many kids are emerging from the pandemic with vision problems, doctors say. A primary culprit, they believe, is increased screen time.<br />Eye doctors say they are seeing more children—many of whom were in virtual school—with new and worsening prescriptions for myopia, or near-sightedness. Rates of myopia in children were already increasing globally before the pandemic, but some research suggests the past year has exacerbated the problem. Doctors also report more cases of digital eye strain in kids.<br />A leading theory behind rising myopia rates posits that when children look at screens or books for prolonged periods, the eye adjusts to accommodate a close focus, which may change and elongate the shape of the eye, leading to myopia. Likewise, decreased outdoor time may increase and worsen myopia, as people tend to look farther away when they’re outside. Natural light and physical activity outside may also play a role. (Adults don’t tend to experience significant worsening of myopia because eye growth generally stabilizes after childhood.)<br />“We know that focusing up close and not being outside has increased the rate of myopia,” says Julia A. Haller, the ophthalmologist-in-chief at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia. “There’s been a huge impact from the pandemic,” she says.<br />In a January study in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology, researchers in China looked at myopia rates in more than 120,000 homebound children during the pandemic and found the prevalence in children ages 6 to 8 increased up to three times compared with the previous five years.</td>

While the weekend’s total represents a significant rebound, domestic ticket sales for all movies during the Memorial Day holiday pre-Covid have tended to surpass $200 million.<br />Still, with the highest-grossing weekend in more than a year, “A Quiet Place Part II” did what avid moviegoers and Hollywood power players hoped it would: demonstrate that moviegoing—a business which has survived past existential threats like the advent of television and then home video—remains a resilient industry despite consumers’ increased adoption of streaming services.<br />Distributed by  ViacomCBS Inc.’s  Paramount Pictures movie studio, “A Quiet Place Part II” picks up where the original, 2018 breakout box-office hit left off, following members of a small family as they navigate a post-apocalyptic world where survivors seek shelter from deadly monsters that have a keen sense of hearing. Actors Emily Blunt and John Krasinski both reprise their roles. Mr. Krasinski, who has surprised fans at some early screenings to drum up interest in the film, also wrote, directed and produced the movie.</td>

      <td>TEL AVIV—Naftali Bennett, a standard-bearer for Israel’s right-wing, was locked in negotiations on Monday with politicians across Israel’s ideological spectrum united in their goal of dislodging from power the country’s longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.<br />The 49-year old former Israeli commando is working with centrist politician Yair Lapid to meet a Wednesday midnight deadline to agree on a coalition that would govern Israel through one of the most tumultuous periods of the country’s history. The disparate parties have aligned mainly to oust Mr. Netanyahu and to avoid another election—the fifth in just over two years.<br />“There are still plenty of obstacles in the way of the formation of the new government. Maybe that’s a good thing because we’ll have to overcome them together,” said Mr. Lapid Monday of the coalition talks. “In a week the state of Israel can be in a new era.”<br />Under the emerging terms of a deal, Mr. Bennett will serve first as prime minister for two years and then Mr. Lapid will succeed him. The other parties that are expected to be part of the government are left-wing Labor and Meretz, centrist Blue and White and right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu and New Hope as well as Mr. Lapid’s centrist Yesh Atid and Mr. Bennett’s right-wing Yamina. Israel’s Islamist party Raam is expected to back the coalition from the outside.<br />Mr. Lapid received the mandate to form the government earlier this month after Mr. Netanyahu failed. He has until Wednesday to tell Israel’s President Reuven Rivlin he is forming a government. Once he does that, the new government must be sworn in within a week, with the support of a majority of the Knesset.</td>

      <td>In pioneering test, insects with a gene primed to interrupt breeding are flying in the Florida Keys</td>
      <td><br />Across the Florida Keys this week, newly hatched mosquitoes are swarming from damp flowerpots, waterlogged spare tires, trash cans and drainage ditches. In six neighborhoods, however, a change is buzzing in the air. Scientists have genetically modified thousands of these mosquitoes and, for the first time in the U.S., set them free to breed.<br />These genetically engineered insects, known by their model number as OX5034, are a laboratory offshoot of the Aedes aegypti mosquito that transmits dengue, Zika and other infectious ills. After a decade of public debate and regulatory delays, these insects are being released by a U.K. biotechnology company called Oxitec.<br />Using genetic-engineering techniques, the company altered the male mosquitoes to pass down a gene that makes females need a dash of the antibiotic tetracycline to survive. Without it, females that spread the disease die as larvae. Altered males, which don’t bite, seek out wild females to mate and spread the lethal trait to future generations. Gradually, more females die. The swarms dwindle and disappear, with no need for chemical insecticides.<br />The Florida Keys field trial is a key step toward federal product approval for the altered insects from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which granted the company an experimental use permit for the test. “This is a big deal,” says molecular biologist Anthony James at the University of California, Irvine, who develops bioengineered mosquitoes but is not involved in the project.</td>

Already one of the league’s top scorers over the last four seasons, the 24-year-old center has taken his game to another level in May and is racking up points at the most efficient clip of any skater in the 2021 postseason.<br />MacKinnon was key to Colorado’s opening round sweep of the St. Louis Blues and added another three points in Sunday’s 7-1 blowout of Las Vegas in Game 1 of the West Division final.<br />But it’s not just his scoring prowess that is propelling the Avalanche.

As a sophomore he netted 38 points in 64 games and added 52 more in 72 contests heading into his contract year.</td>

      <td>Torrance, Calif.<br />Crazy California laws occasionally go national. Take SB 132, which took effect in January. It allows transgender-identified male state prison inmates to transfer into women’s prisons based on “individual preference”—no hormones, surgery or time spent living as the opposite sex required. Spokeswoman Terry Thornton of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation says 264 male prisoners have declared a nonmale identity and formally requested transfer to women’s facilities.<br />If Congress passes the Equality Act—the House already has—incarcerated biological men who identify as female would be entitled to transfer into women’s federal prisons and possibly also state prisons nationwide. How’s that working in California?<br />Not well, according to Amie Ichikawa, who was released in 2013 from the Central California Women’s Facility in Chowchilla, where she served five years for assault and kidnapping. Ms. Ichikawa is now forming a nonprofit to help currently incarcerated women. I visited her home in Torrance, and she put me in touch with four other current and former inmates. She contacted me after I appeared at a March Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to testify against the Equality Act. I told the lawmakers that although the vast majority of transgender Americans are peaceful, decent and law-abiding, the overbroad bill would be subject to abuse by opportunistic male felons.<br />None of the currently and formerly incarcerated women I spoke to expressed any animus toward transgender people. All acknowledged that some biological men who are transgender have been subject to abuse in men’s prisons. Several of the women made a point of saying they’d have no problem sharing a cell with natal males who have undergone sex-reassignment surgery.</td>

Amnesty International has declared him a prisoner of conscience. On Wednesday the New York Review of Books ran an open letter from more than 30 artists and writers across the globe demanding his release.<br />Don’t bet on it. This poor Afro-Cuban, armed only with his courage, intellect and creativity, is an existential threat to Cuba’s ruling elite.<br />Mr. Otero Alcántara is a founder of the San Isidro Movement, a collection of Cuban artists, writers, musicians, students and researchers formed in 2018 to oppose regime censorship. He was on a hunger strike to protest state confiscation of his artwork when police carted him off. They wanted to put an end to the public spectacle of his deteriorating physical condition.<br />The dictatorship also may have thought that by “hospitalizing” Mr. Otero Alcántara it would gag the movement—and maybe even get rid of him. (He’s in the same hospital where Ladies in White leader Laura Pollán died in 2011 at the height of her effectiveness as a regime critic.)

If the plaintiffs, Students for Fair Admissions, win, you can bet that elite college- and graduate-admissions offices around the country will establish workarounds to assure that opportunities remain for admittance of significant numbers of underrepresented minorities. And they’d be right to do so.<br />Expect opaque and unmeasurable admissions criteria to replace objective and rigorous standardized testing such as the SAT and ACT. These tests have their warts, no doubt, but they are more relevant than ever to help select the worthiest candidates, given vastly different educational experiences and rampant grade inflation. The tests have been shown to significantly predict first-year grades in universities at least as well for underrepresented minorities as for others. And recognizing the tests’ disparate socio-economic impact, admissions offices by and large have done an admirable job of using the tests flexibly and equitably, permitting more leeway for applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds. This approach has been a lifeline for minority students. Do we really want to jettison it?<br />California, which has an anti-affirmative-action constitutional provision perpetually in the bull’s-eye of activists, has done just that. The UC Board of Regents voted last year to eliminate SAT/ACT requirements for new students. How the UC system will competently and fairly sift through the thousands and thousands of applicants—including making comparisons between minority candidates—in the absence of objective criteria like these tests is anyone’s guess.<br />Let’s not repeat that fiasco in waiting nationally. The justices would be wise to take a pass on the Harvard case, or to affirm the lower courts’ decisions.<br />William G. Lawlor</td>

Consider this recent summary, by the Cato Institute’s Scott Lincicome, of the healthy state of America’s semiconductor industry: “The United States is also a top-five global exporter of semiconductors and related equipment, shipping almost $47 billion of those goods in 2019. These and other data led the SIA [Semiconductor Industry of America] to conclude in its 2020 State of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry report that ‘the semiconductor manufacturing base in the United States remains on solid footing.’”<br />“The SIA also reports that the U.S. industry has ‘nearly half’ of all global semiconductor sales—a market share that has been steady (ranging from the mid‐40s to low 50s) since the late 1990s—and is the top seller in every major regional market, including China. Sales by U.S. semiconductor firms also grew from $76.7 billion in 1999 to $192.8 billion in 2019—a compound annual growth rate of almost 5%.”<br />“Beyond output and sales, the U.S. semiconductor industry has been a global leader in capital spending (capex) and R&D.”<br />Subsidies are always suspect, but when showered on industries that are thriving, they are beyond doubt inexcusable.

      <td>Shift comes as Beijing struggles to reverse a worsening demographic situation</td>
      <td>China no longer has a “one-child policy,” but it still keeps a lid on births.  Beijing on Monday said it would allow all couples to have up to three children, another gradual lifting of its birth restrictions as the number of babies born continues to shrink and the population ages. Here is the background.<br />In 1980, amid concerns the population was ballooning too quickly, China formally implemented a policy stipulating that most couples could only have one child. The policy was in place for more than three decades and was enforced by a massive family-planning bureaucracy. After some gradual loosening, Beijing said in late 2015 that it would allow all couples to have two children. This week, it increased the number to three<br />Chinese leaders have credited the policy with reining in explosive population growth, helping to lift the country out of poverty and limit its carbon emissions. Some economists and demographers say the effect on birthrates may have happened anyway as China grew wealthier. The policy’s lasting legacy is a mind-set where one child is the norm. Many couples now feel that they can’t afford two children, let alone three.<br />Beijing had projected that the move would lead to a sustained rise in births, but that hasn’t happened. In 2016, the first year of the two-child policy, births rose, but every year since has seen a drop. In 2020, there were around 12 million births, compared with 14.65 million the year before and 17.86 million in 2016.<br />In recent years, there are signs that authorities in parts of China have looked the other way when couples have three children, but fines and other consequences can still be meted out for “violating birth policies.” The rules are more strictly implemented for public-sector workers, who can face dismissal if they have more than the allowed number of children.</td>

Last week, Shaftesbury said the value of its central-London retail stores fell 18% over the six months through March, while another London-focused real-estate investment trust,  Great Portland Estates ,  recently said its stores have lost 27% in value over its latest fiscal year. Their offices slipped a more modest 3%, on average.<br />Stock investors are notably more bearish. The big discounts-to-book values at which U.K. office REITs trade imply approximately a 15% fall in property values, according to real-estate research firm Green Street.<br />The divergence between office and store valuations can also be seen in New York, though office values have come down more sharply than in London. A full 16.1% of the U.S. city’s office space is now available to rent, Colliers data shows—higher than during the 2009 financial crisis.</td>

      <td>What looks like a children’s desk lamp, behaves like  Amazon.com Inc.’s  Alexa and comes with two surveillance cameras? The latest educational fad in China.<br />“Smart homework lamps” have skyrocketed in popularity since ByteDance Inc., the creator of short video app TikTok, first introduced the $120 lamps in October. Chinese parents snapped up 10,000 units within the first month. The product’s popularity spurred ByteDance to ramp up marketing and its rivals to roll out their own versions, all while testing the Chinese public’s tolerance for more cameras.<br />The lamps come equipped with two built-in cameras—one facing the child and another offering a bird’s-eye view from above—letting parents remotely monitor their children when they study. There is a smartphone-sized screen attached to each lamp, which applies artificial intelligence to offer guidance on math problems and difficult words. And parents can hire a human proctor to digitally monitor their children as they study.<br />In addition to the basic version of the lamp, a $170 upgraded model sends alerts and photos to parents when their children slouch. That version of the lamp sold out on China’s largest e-commerce platforms earlier this month.<br />Ni Ying, a 36-year-old in Shanghai who bought the basic version of the lamp in March, paid an extra $350 for three teachers to remotely watch her daughter do homework each afternoon for two hours over the course of three months.</td>

      <td>The powerful economic rebound is making winners of investors who wagered on businesses revving up again</td>
      <td>Investors are amassing hefty gains by loading up on economically sensitive stocks that have flourished during this year’s explosion of business activity.<br />More than two dozen actively managed exchange-traded funds have surged at least 20% so far this year, outpacing the S&P 500’s 12% climb. Goldman Sachs analysts say 56% of stock-picking large-cap mutual funds are beating their benchmarks, the highest percentage in more than a decade.<br />Some of the best performers include companies with smaller market capitalizations and so-called value stocks—those deemed inexpensive relative to measures of a company’s net worth. The energy-focused  for example, has risen 48% this year thanks to a recovery in oil prices. It includes top holdings such as  Energy Transfer  LP, up 62% since December.<br />The  which focuses on companies returning the most cash to shareholders, has also jumped 48% this year. Primary holdings include  Rent-A-Center Inc.  and  Toll Brothers Inc.,  which have both gained more than 50%. The Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF, which has soared 36%, boosted by  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. ’s 82% gain and a climb of 72% from aluminum maker  Alcoa Corp.<br />The moves mark a reversal of last year’s trend, when the pandemic slowed economic activity and stock pickers flooded into shares of technology companies that many believed could benefit from the crisis. Now business activity is expected to surge to its highest level in at least four decades, driving investors toward shares of manufacturers, energy companies and others tied to economic growth. That includes steelmaker  Nucor Corp. , which has gained 93% this year to lead the S&P 500 and  Marathon Oil Corp. , which has climbed 82%.</td>

      <td>Keep an eye on skills shortages, consumers’ wallets and the market’s expectations</td>
      <td>Inflation is here already, and in the long run there is a lot of upward pressure on prices. But between now and then lies a big question for investors and the economy: Is the Federal Reserve right to think that the price rises we’re seeing now are temporary and will abate by next year?<br />Some at the Fed are already having vague doubts, starting to talk about when to discuss removing some of their extraordinary stimulus even as they continue to push the idea that inflation is likely to fall back of its own accord.<br />The argument that inflation is temporary is simple. Consumer demand has been boosted massively by stimulus and the reopening release of pent-up demand. Supply is unable to keep up thanks to inventories and capabilities run down when demand collapsed during lockdown, workers unwilling to return to work and the overhang of Covid-19 restrictions on production. As a result, there are some extraordinary price ramps in narrow areas, such as used cars, that are pushing up headline numbers. The resulting price rises will abate once spare cash is spent and business is back to normal.<br />The difficulty is how to test whether this is right, because many of the usual gauges are being mucked up by the scale of the post-pandemic rebound. There are three broad areas to watch: the labor force, consumer demand and inflation expectations.<br />Workers can embed inflation through pay raises. There aren’t enough workers, so wages go up. Those workers have more money to spend, so prices of goods and services rise. The workers then demand pay raises, and on and on.</td>

      <td>Camber USA, a largely unknown apparel manufacturer in Norristown, Pa., has reached cult status thanks to its beefy sweatshirts and tees</td>
      <td>BEIGE HABILLEUR, a boutique tucked away in Paris’s tony 16th arrondissement, stocks a cosmopolitan assortment of men’s clothes including $330 mandarin-collared dress shirts from Italy’s Salvatore Piccolo and $1,400 Edward Green tassel loafers. But Beige also stocks a far humbler product: $150-ish American-made hoodies by Camber USA. (This price is marked up internationally, and Americans can find Camber hoodies for half that price.)<br />Camber’s hoodies are as thick as a bath mat and tender on the inside, like an old blanket that has been through the spin cycle a few dozen times. Certain fastidious fans of fleece hold them up as some of the best hoodies in the world. When Matthew Spade, 35, a social media content creator in Blackpool, England, recently embarked on a quest to find the ultimate sweatshirt, Camber’s chunky pullover won out. He specifically likes what he calls Camber’s “hood integrity.” As Mr. Spade demonstrated over a Zoom call, even when worn down, the stocky hood stacks up to his earlobes like a permanent scarf.<br />These sweatshirts, though, are devilishly hard to find in England. When the very few online stores based in the U.K. that sell Camber products post them online, they “sell out quicker than a hiccup, it’s actually ridiculous,” said Mr. Spade. International online sites often demand exorbitant shipping costs or won’t ship to the U.K. Mr. Spade resorted to buying his gray Camber hoodie from a friend.<br />It’s not just Europe that cherishes Camber. On Instagram you can often find posts from immaculately dressed, sweatshirt-wearing Japanese folks, with the hashtag #CamberUSA. Search Camber USA on YouTube and you’ll find a video by an excitable American with the partial title “The BEST Made in USA sweatshirt.”<br />Camber might have a worldwide reputation, but it’s achieved that in spite of its indifferent approach to marketing. Camber is “kind of elusive,” said Robert Davison, 26, a graphic designer in Brooklyn and Camber aficionado. He couldn’t even find an Instagram account for the company when he looked recently.</td>

Credit Suisse  is under pressure to recover money quickly and has named Bluestone as one of three large borrowers from the Greensill funds that it has identified in its recovery efforts.<br />Bluestone hadn’t expected to begin repaying the Greensill loans until 2023 at the earliest, it said in a lawsuit brought in March in a New York federal court alleging Greensill committed fraud in its lending practices.</td>

      <td>The road to profitability looks long for Meituan as it invests to elbow out rivals in new ventures like group buying for lower-income regions</td>
      <td>Chinese internet giant Meituan delivered strong results in its core businesses last quarter. The bad news: New ventures may keep burning cash for a while.<br />The company said Friday that its revenue for the quarter ending in March rose 121% from a year earlier to a record. Operating profit for its core food delivery business rose 26% from a quarter earlier. Revenue at its in-store, hotel & travel segment also grew 113% year-over-year for the quarter. As Covid-19 is largely under control in China, spending on travel and other in-store services have gone up too. While most of Meituan’s revenue comes from online delivery, the in-store and travel segment is the most profitable. Operating profit margin there was 42% against 5% for food delivery.<br />But the whole company remained in the red for the second quarter in a row as spending on new businesses picked up markedly. Its new-initiatives segment lost the equivalent of $1.26 billion in the quarter, nearly six times the losses of a year earlier. Meituan started ramping up investments in areas like community group buying, a way to deliver groceries to the country’s less-developed regions. Losses will likely continue to widen as the company invests in delivery infrastructure, especially of the cold-chain variety for frozen food. Morgan Stanley, for example, expects the equivalent of $5.4 billion of operating losses for the segment in 2021.<br />But investors seem to be taking comfort that at least Meituan’s core businesses are doing well enough to help to fund such spending: The company’s shares jumped 11% Monday.<br />The big investment, however, comes when other internet giants are also raising their spending on new opportunities including community group buying. Alibaba says it will put “all incremental profit” back into areas like technology innovation and supply-chain capabilities. Tencent says it will increase its rate of investment in business services, games and short-form videos.</td>

Ohio is considering a similar measure.<br />The outcome of the battle has the potential to reshape the future of the utility industry, and demand for natural gas, which the U.S. produces more of than any other country.<br />Proponents of phasing out natural gas say their aim is to reduce planet-warming emissions over time by fully electrifying new homes and buildings as wind and solar farms proliferate throughout the country, making the power grid cleaner.</td>

The announcement comes just weeks after a once-in-a-decade census showed China’s population on the cusp of a historic turning point after decades of rapid growth.<br />The Communist Party’s Politburo said after a meeting Monday chaired by leader Xi Jinping that it would offer more equitable educational resources and reduce educational expenditures for families—widely seen by experts as factors holding back many young couples from having more children.<br />The Politburo also pledged to improve the nation’s maternity-leave policies, enhance its tax and housing policies and better protect the rights of female workers in a bid to encourage couples to have more babies.<br />The number of births in China stood at 12 million in 2020, an 18% drop from a year earlier and the fourth straight year of declining births, following an increase in 2016.

      <td>The Biden Administration’s effort to distribute federal benefits by race is already running into legal trouble. Two rulings last week sided with plaintiffs who sued the Small Business Administration for violating equal treatment under the law.<br />At issue is the SBA requirement that only applications for restaurant relief from women and racial minorities will be processed in the first 21 days, sending everyone else to the back of the line. As the courts recognized, the danger is that the SBA will run out of funds before these other applications can be considered.<br />A federal judge in Texas ruled that the SBA’s Restaurant Revitalization Fund was wrong to distribute $28.6 billion in Covid-19 relief on the basis of an owner’s sex and race. Plaintiffs Jason and Janice Smith’s restaurant Blessed Cajuns lost nearly $350,000 in gross revenue due to Covid-19. Eric Nyman’s restaurant lost $800,000 during the pandemic.<br />America First Legal, which represents them, notes they are eligible for the relief but not for the SBA’s priority-group status. Federal Judge Reed O’Connor granted a preliminary injunction on grounds the restaurateurs are “experiencing race and sex discrimination at the hand of government officials.”<br />Meanwhile, in Vitolo v. Guzman the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals granted a preliminary injunction against the SBA on behalf of white plaintiff Antonio Vitolo, half-owner of Jake’s Bar and Grill in Tennessee. The other half is owned by his wife, a Latina. In a 2-1 decision joined by Judge Alan Norris, Judge Amul Thapar cites Supreme Court precedents such as Adarand and Richmond v.

      <td>Olivia Rodrigo has stormed the charts—hitting No. 1 with huge streaming numbers for an album that clinches her status as one of music’s biggest new stars.<br />The Disney actress and pop singer-songwriter’s debut album “Sour” tops the latest Billboard 200 chart, generating the equivalent of 295,000 in U.S. sales in the week ended May 27. It is the biggest week for a debut charting album since late 2014, when Billboard began including streaming in its flagship album-sales chart, the magazine said.<br />Much of the 18-year-old artist’s units—218,000—came from her album’s massive 301 million first-week U.S. streams, according to MRC Data, formerly known as Nielsen Music. That is the second-biggest streaming week ever for an album by a woman, second only to Ariana Grande’s 307 million first-week streams for “Thank U, Next” in 2019. The rest of Ms. Rodrigo’s units came from traditional sales. (For Billboard, 1,250 streams by paying streaming-service subscribers, or 3,750 streams on free services like YouTube or Spotify’s ad-supported option, equals one album sale.)<br />Ms. Rodrigo’s No. 1 debut is the biggest week for an album so far this year, beating Taylor Swift’s rerecorded 2008 album “Fearless (Taylor’s Version),” which moved 291,000 units in its opening week. “Sour,” which Ms. Rodrigo released on May 21, features “Drivers License,” the year’s biggest hit, with roughly 800 million streams on Spotify alone, and “Good 4 U”—both of which topped Billboard’s Hot 100 singles chart. With a blockbuster debut record, two No. 1 singles and a recent performance on “Saturday Night Live,” Ms. Rodrigo has successfully leveraged her fame from “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” into pop stardom.<br />She’s “the biggest breakout pop star of 2021 by far,” Chris DeVille, senior editor at the website Stereogum, wrote this month.</td>

      <td>ISMAILIA, Egypt—Egyptian officials made their most specific allegations against the captain of a container ship that blocked the Suez Canal for nearly a week in March, accusing the skipper of losing control of the Ever Given and hitting the vital waterway’s bank.<br />The ship swerved left and right before becoming lodged in the bank of the canal, said Sayed Sheisha, the chief investigator for the Suez Canal Authority. “The captain issued eight commands within 12 minutes as he tried to bring the ship back into alignment.”<br />The question of who is to blame for the accident is at the heart of a dispute over how much compensation the ship’s owners should pay. Egyptian authorities seized the ship in April and are now demanding $550 million to cover for lost revenues, damage to the canal, and the cost of rescuing the ship.<br />The Japanese company that owns the ship, Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., didn’t respond to calls and emails seeking comment. The company that manages the ship, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement Ltd., also didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />A lawyer for the Japanese company has previously blamed the Suez Canal Authority for allowing the ship to enter the canal during a massive sandstorm that was taking place in Egypt at the time. Initial investigations into the accident had focused on a sudden gust of wind.</td>

      <td>ZIPAQUIRÁ, Colombia—As his homeland struggles with a surge in Covid-19 deaths, a tanking economy and clashes between protesters and antiriot police, cycling phenomenon Egan Bernal has provided his fellow Colombians with a more rose-colored view of their nation.<br />Bernal, who in 2019 became the first Colombian to win the Tour de France, on Sunday won his sport’s second-most important stage race, the three-week-long Giro d’Italia, and claimed its pink champion’s jersey, known as the maglia rosa.<br />“This is something that Colombia needed, given all that has happened to the country,” said David Ortiz, a circus performer who biked to Bernal’s hometown of Zipaquirá, near the capital of Bogotá, to watch Sunday’s final stage on a widescreen television at a crowded outdoor plaza.<br />Indeed, Bernal’s triumph was a rare bit of good news amid the helter-skelter of Colombia, where nearly five weeks of antigovernment protests sparked by economic misery have led to at least 25 deaths, road blockades that have paralyzed the economy and the torching of government offices and police stations.<br />What rights groups assert is disproportionate police force against demonstrators has prompted an international outcry, reams of bad press for Colombia and even calls for President Iván Duque to resign. All this comes as Colombia is logging one of the world’s highest per capita Covid-19 death rates.</td>

      <td>TEL AVIV—Israeli right-wing politician Naftali Bennett said Sunday he plans to join a rival in a coalition opposed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, paving the way for the formation of a government that would end the incumbent’s more than decadelong grip on power.<br />“It is my intention to act with all my power to establish a national unity government with my friend Yair Lapid so that we can save this country from this spiral and get it back on path,” Mr. Bennett said. “We can stop this insanity and take responsibility.”<br />Mr. Bennett’s Yamina party is expected to be the main partner to Yair Lapid’s centrist Yesh Atid party in the coalition. Mr. Lapid received the mandate to form a government earlier this month after Mr. Netanyahu first failed to do so following an inconclusive March election, the country’s fourth since 2019.<br />Efforts to form a ruling coalition could still collapse as many parties from across the political spectrum try and agree on the government’s agenda and cabinet portfolios. It would also likely need the outside support of Israel’s Arab parties.<br />Mr. Lapid has until June 2 to inform the president of his government formation plan. If he fails to do so, President Reuven Rivlin would then hand responsibility for selecting a new prime minister back to Israel’s parliament before a new election is called.</td>

But unlike in investigations involving crashes, the plane and crew are safe, and the aircraft’s black box has been available to investigators for almost a week.<br />Meanwhile, sometimes-competing jurisdictions in the probe and political sensitivities over what has become an international incident have made the investigation more complex than most.<br />“Most investigations start from a premise of determining what should have happened, then examine what did happen” and then reconcile the two and draw lessons learned, said Conor Nolan, chairman of the Virginia-based Flight Safety Foundation, which advocates for air safety. “In this case, we cannot easily determine what should have happened because it is far from clear how reliable any of the source data is.”<br />Lithuania and Poland haven’t yet determined where they will ship the black box for analysis, saying they are looking for a country that won’t appear to be politically biased. Lithuania, where the plane landed after its stop in Minsk, has opened a criminal probe. Officials there said they have interviewed passengers and debriefed the cockpit and cabin crew. The plane and crew returned Saturday to London’s Stansted Airport,  Ryanair ’s  biggest base.</td>

But he identified the return of Congress on June 7 as when the talks would need to indicate an endpoint.<br />“I think we are getting pretty close to a fish-or-cut-bait moment,” Mr. Buttigieg said during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.”<br />Negotiations over the measure have stretched for weeks as lawmakers and the White House argue over the basic questions of what should be included, how large it should be and how to pay for it.<br />A sticking point is funding for the projects. Republicans want to tap at least two sources to help pay for rebuilding roads and bridges: repurposed, unspent funds from the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief law from earlier this year; as well as user fees on electric vehicles. The Biden administration has proposed funding the measure through tax increases on corporations, including by raising the corporate rate to 28% from 21%, a plan that has drawn strong objections from Republicans.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Friday’s jobs report is shaping up to be a pivotal data release for the Federal Reserve as it charts a plan for ending the easy-money policies that have propped up the economy and markets for more than a year.<br />The May report will help central bankers understand two key questions that now dominate their attention. First, how quickly is the labor market recovering jobs shed during the Covid-19 pandemic? Second, do the supply bottlenecks fueling a recent inflation upswing show any sign of diminishing?<br />The answers will help determine when the Fed begins scaling back its large bond-buying programs and how it thinks about future interest-rate increases.<br />Policy makers project a rapid recovery in the labor market this spring and summer, accompanied by moderate inflation. Such a scenario would allow the Fed to tighten monetary policy gradually and predictably, officials hope. But the path is treacherous. The mere discussion of pulling back easy money in 2013 led to turbulence in bond markets known as the “taper tantrum.”<br />Recent data have complicated matters for the central bank. The Labor Department reported this month that hiring slowed unexpectedly in April. Meanwhile consumer prices rose at a rate that was nearly twice the Fed’s target. Policy makers believe that supply bottlenecks—including challenges bringing people back into the workforce after months of being locked down in a pandemic—may have contributed.</td>

      <td>Makers of cleansing and disinfectant products would have investors believe that people are keen to keep wiping things down post-pandemic. Common sense argues otherwise.<br />Clorox  and Lysol-maker  Reckitt Benckiser  were both major beneficiaries of the crisis, with their shares rallying around 50% and 40% respectively from the end of February 2020 to their highs last summer. Now, doubts have crept in. So far this year, Clorox is down around 13% and Reckitt is down 3%. By comparison, the S&P 500 consumer staples subindex is up around 4% over the same period.<br />Both companies argue that consumer habits have shifted more permanently, with a greater emphasis on hygiene that is likely to persist. The latest available data back this up to a degree. According to preliminary estimates from Numerator for the four weeks through May 16, sales of all-purpose cleaners and cleaning wipes were down 30% and 22% from the same period a year earlier. However, compared with the same period in pre-pandemic 2019, sales of these two product categories were still up by 24% and 45%.<br />While cleanser sales might well stay somewhat elevated for a while, some skepticism is in order. It isn’t just that vaccinations are rising and new Covid-19 cases are slowing in advanced markets like the U.S. and Europe. Public-health authorities have adjusted their messaging in recent months to stress that Covid-19 is mostly transmitted through the air, de-emphasizing the role of transmission via contaminated surfaces and giving regrets to many for having become compulsive cleaners. Products like hand sanitizer, which were hard to find early in the pandemic, are now in chronic oversupply.<br />Bear in mind that very few people actually enjoy cleaning in the way that home chefs who picked up new skills or equipment during the pandemic may well be pleased to keep putting them to use. Others who invested in a new Peloton might decide they prefer it to the gym, but not many will be nostalgic for their pandemic collection of Lysol wipes.</td>

When Ms. Clark reviews projects on her iPhone, the earbuds switch to that device instead. “I lose my focus.

      <td>Since opening the Inn at Little Washington in the late ’70s, the James Beard Award–winning chef Patrick O’Connell has transformed Washington, Virginia. Now he’s introducing Patty O’s Cafe & Bakery, his first new restaurant in 40 years.</td>
      <td>When Patrick O’Connell first moved to rural Washington, Virginia in 1972, he cooked inside of a decommissioned school bus attached to the back of his house. O’Connell, then 26, grew up about 80 miles away in a Washington, D.C., suburb and had saved enough money working as a waiter to buy a plot of land, and a home, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Appalachian dwellings like his often originated from scrap. “You’d add on,” O’Connell says. “It would become better and better.”<br />Now, approaching his 50th year in Washington, population 135, O’Connell, the 75-year-old chef-owner of the Inn at Little Washington, holds the deeds to 21 buildings in town, the result of a purchasing spree that began in the late 1970s when the chef first decided he wanted to run a brick-and-mortar restaurant rather than the catering outfit he’d been operating for five years. (In those days, O’Connell also worked as a butler and a house painter.) The buildings he has since acquired, first with business partner Reinhardt Lynch and then solo, after their 2006 separation, constitute the inn’s campus: 23 lavishly decorated guest rooms and cottages, a Michelin-three-star dining room, a ballroom and shops.<br />Aside from the inn’s kitchen, which is housed in new construction and recently underwent a roughly million-dollar upgrade, O’Connell classifies each of his buildings as a “restoration, transformation or resurrection.” This summer, work will be completed on one such project, Patty O’s Cafe & Bakery, O’Connell’s first new restaurant since 1978, when he opened the inn itself.<br />O’Connell’s holdings date back to the 18th century and represent a number of different styles of architecture, from Colonial Revival to Jeffersonian. Throughout the decades, O’Connell has bolstered his real-estate portfolio in order to accommodate the sustained demand to visit the inn. In doing so, he continues to build a world of his own florid design: a series of meticulously restored colonial American facades whose interiors bear Moroccan lanterns, Balinese umbrellas and animal murals. It all reflects his maximal and fantastical ideas about hospitality, which he describes as a feeling of going to your grandmother’s house if your grandmother dropped acid. “People can come here and be whoever they want, wherever they want,” O’Connell says. “They can bring their own script and escape.”<br />O’Connell owns about a block and a half of the four-block downtown. Washington’s mayor, Thomas Catlin, calls O’Connell a visionary, describing how the chef’s oeuvre has helped safeguard Washington against the kind of rural decay that’s ubiquitous throughout Appalachia. In addition to the inn’s long list of accolades and its critical success (O’Connell won the James Beard Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019, and the inn remains the only restaurant in the Michelin Guide for Washington, D.C., with a three-star rating), it is also its county’s largest private employer. The inn’s tax revenue has long paid for the vast majority of Washington’s budget. “We pay them well over $1,000 per day,” O’Connell says. In O’Connell’s case, municipal interest and self-interest have merged. For the inn to thrive as a world-class destination, he believes it must be aligned with the town. “The more we’ve invested, the more there is here for us to protect,” he says.</td>

Former President Barack and Michelle Obama’s company has found success producing unscripted projects, including last year’s Oscar-winner for best documentary, “American Factory.”<br />ViacomCBS Inc. CEO Bob Bakish, who is trying to build out his company’s streaming service Paramount+, recently dubbed unscripted programming “the fastest-growing genre in streaming.” The company spent $15 billion on content last year and has made nonfiction a priority with shows such as the tattoo artist series “Ink Master” and docuseries “From Cradle to Stage,” directed by Foo Fighters lead singer Dave Grohl.</td>

      <td>Legislators slammed banks last week for the money they made from overdraft fees. It turns out, though, that overdraft revenue fell in 2020 for the first time in six years.<br />The reasons? With nowhere to go when Covid-19 hit, many people curbed their spending. Stimulus money helped them pad their bank accounts. And banks were also more lenient about waiving the fees.<br />Financial firms brought in an estimated $31.3 billion in consumer overdraft revenue in 2020, according to financial-data firm Moebs Services Inc., down nearly 10% from the year before. The number of overdraft transactions in 2020 fell to less than 1 billion after topping that mark for about two decades, Moebs found, and the median fee last year was $30.<br />The decline in overall fees is another example of how Covid-19 changed consumer finance in surprising ways. At the start of the pandemic, U.S. lenders feared a huge surge in delinquencies. But then the government stepped in with expanded unemployment benefits and stimulus checks, and many people were able to save money and pay off debt. Many banks also waived some overdraft fees, especially early in the pandemic.<br />Fees of all types are important to banks’ revenue, especially in a year when low interest rates crimped lending profitability and loan demand was low. More people could start racking up overdraft fees when government stimulus measures end.</td>

The pace of Mr. Biden’s nominations for the roughly 1,200-Senate confirmed positions has also surpassed those of Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.<br />But while Mr. Biden’s cabinet nominees were confirmed relatively quickly, he trails those three in overall Senate confirmations at this point of his presidency, clearing 53 of his nominees so far. The lack of Senate-confirmed leaders throughout the government can lead to delays in implementing executive actions and initiatives within federal agencies, with some cabinet-level departments led by secretaries and deputy secretaries at this stage and many key positions filled with acting leadership.<br />Through the end of May of their first year in office, Mr. Clinton had 151 confirmations, Mr. Obama had secured 145 and Mr. Bush had 126, according to Center for Presidential Transition data.

      <td>SYDNEY—Researchers on a boat off the southern coast of Australia recently began throwing some 50,000 bags of sand into the ocean. Their goal is to restore about two dozen acres of seagrass on the ocean floor that will suck carbon out of the atmosphere.<br />The move is part of an intensified push in some countries to slow warming temperatures on the planet by not only preserving or restoring trees—which also absorb carbon—but also by mending habitats along the world’s coastlines.<br />These so-called “blue carbon” areas, which aside from meadows of underwater seagrass also include mangroves and tidal marshes, often store more carbon per acre than forests and hold it for a long time, scientists say. From Australia to Colombia to the U.S., these coastal zones are becoming a priority for conservation and restoration as researchers and policy makers start to appreciate their potential to take carbon out of the atmosphere.<br />Carbon released into the atmosphere from man-made sources such as fossil-fuel-burning power plants and cars is contributing to a warming climate, many scientists say, which is why researchers are seeking ways to capture and store it.<br />“We looked at our coastal ecosystems and we realized there is actually quite a large potential there,” said Neil McFarlane, an official overseeing climate-change strategy for South Australia, one of the country’s six states. “Blue carbon is a whole area that we believe hasn’t been explored nearly hard enough.”</td>

      <td>BOGOTÁ, Colombia—President Ivan Duque ordered troops deployed across a swath of Colombia to bring order after a month of antigovernment protests that have left more than 25 people dead and hobbled Latin America’s fourth-largest economy.<br />Some 7,000 soldiers were to be sent out Saturday and in the coming days in the southwestern province of Valle del Cauca and the city Cali, which erupted into violence Friday that officials said left at least five people dead.<br />The president announced Friday his government would go with a “maximum deployment” of soldiers to assist police, who have been locked in almost daily confrontations with protesters in Cali. Demonstrators have targeted police with rocks, Molotov cocktails and sometimes firearms; the police have responded with tear gas and, in some cases, gunfire, videos of the encounters show.<br />“This deployment will almost triple our capability in less than 24 hours throughout the province,” Mr. Duque said. As of Saturday, more than 1,140 troops had arrived in Cali and began dismantling the roadblocks that antigovernment demonstrators have assembled on major thoroughfares.<br />The government is aiming to beef up security forces in places where Mr. Duque said authorities “have seen acts of vandalism, violence and low-intensity urban terrorism.” Army and marine troops were to be deployed in the country’s key Pacific port, Buenaventura, and in a total of 10 of Colombia’s 32 provinces.</td>

Tuchel, who lost in the final with PSG last season, had gone from unemployed on Christmas to European champion.<br />The difference came in the 42nd minute when Chelsea’s homegrown midfielder Mason Mount sliced open the middle of City’s defense with a pass to find Kai Havertz, who carried the ball around the goalkeeper and passed it into an empty net.</td>

      <td>OTTAWA—A Canadian west-coast indigenous community says it discovered the remains of more than 200 children it believes attended a state-run school, reopening wounds about the country’s centurylong mistreatment of its indigenous people.<br />The Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation, in the province of British Columbia, said the remains of an estimated 215 children were found through the use of ground-penetrating radar, which surveyed nearby territory where a government-funded boarding school for indigenous students once operated. The First Nation, based in the town of Kamloops, expects to complete its findings in mid-June.<br />“We’re still grappling through the effects,” Chief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation said Friday at a press conference. “This loss is absolutely unthinkable.”<br />Political leaders, led by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, have relayed their condolences to the indigenous community. “It is a painful reminder of that dark and shameful chapter of our country’s history,” Mr. Trudeau said via his official Twitter account. Mr. Trudeau has worked to advance reconciliation with the country’s 1.7 million indigenous people, which he has made a policy priority since coming to office. Indigenous Canadians make up roughly 5% of the total 38 million population and fare poorly on a range of indicators, with higher rates of suicide, incarceration and infant mortality than the general population.<br />For more than a century, Canada’s residential school system, as it was known, separated some 150,000 indigenous children from their families. An estimated 4,100 children died of disease or by accident while in the system, according to an inquiry report in 2015, which said the school system was akin to cultural genocide. The inquiry said a complete death toll might never be known because officials at the time destroyed hundreds of records.</td>

Banks and other lenders issued the loans, which the SBA guaranteed.<br />After the program’s general funding was exhausted in early May, funds had remained only for certain community lenders to issue the loans. The SBA’s Friday notice said these lenders had submitted 125,000 origination requests in the preceding 24 hours.</td>

      <td>By putting the first American in orbit in 1962, NASA ensured a civilian future for space exploration</td>
      <td>John F. Kennedy had not even taken the oath of office when the battle began. In December 1960, with the inauguration a month away, the U.S. Air Force launched a first strike—not against a foreign enemy but against NASA, the civilian space agency. In a letter to commanders, the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force expressed confidence that the president-elect understood the imperative of “military supremacy in space” and would, therefore, grant the Air Force the primary role. Making sure that Kennedy got the point, the Air Force leaked its letter.<br />“Space Fight,” cheered Aviation Week. Yet this was more than a turf war. At stake was the very purpose of the U.S. space program. Would the nation stay committed to “space for peace,” the policy of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the outgoing president? Or would the new administration see space as the Air Force did: an arena of the Cold War, a battlefront on which armed conflict might be inevitable? The decision was Kennedy’s to make—though it would come to depend, as events unfolded, on an astronaut named John Glenn.<br />To the Air Force top brass, the existence of NASA was an affront. The Space Act of 1958, which created NASA and gave it control over human spaceflight, was a rebuke to every military planner with fantasies of orbital fighter planes or space stations teeming with missiles. At a time when the Soviet Union was achieving one “first” after another—the first satellite, the first animal in orbit, the first unmanned craft to reach the lunar surface—Eisenhower held to his view that space exploration served no national security interest. As a concession, he allowed the Air Force to continue development of the X-20, a high-altitude bomber, but the “man-in-space” program, Project  Mercury ,  was NASA’s domain.<br />Kennedy’s election gave the generals cause for hope. “If the Soviets control space,” he had said during the campaign, “they can control earth.” In the eyes of the world, he argued, “second in space” meant second in science and technology, second in military power, second in the struggle between freedom and totalitarian rule. In late 1960, a classified U.S. Information Agency report—which caused a stir when it leaked—revealed that Soviet superiority in space was eroding global confidence in the U.S. “Satellite pessimism,” analysts called it. Pressure was building for a show of strength in space.<br />And NASA held a weakening hand. The astronauts were popular with the public, but the manned program was well behind schedule and marred by failure. Rockets exploded on the launchpad; payloads ended up in the sea. Rumors circulated that Kennedy would transfer Mercury to the military or cancel it altogether—a course that his science adviser, Jerome Wiesner, preferred.</td>

Our social calendars, barren through much of 2020, are beginning to fill up with weddings, vacations and face-to-face meetings. Nights out and weekend excursions (of the non-socially distanced variety) are becoming relatively commonplace again. “A Quiet Place Part II” and “Cruella” have just opened in movie theaters across the country and, if not as failure-proof as past Memorial Day Weekend blockbusters, they are each expected to pull in up to $40 or $50 million in their first weekend. For months, sports teams have been steadily upping their attendance numbers—last Saturday, over 14,000 hollering fans turned out to watch the Brooklyn Nets host the Boston Celtics in Game One of their NBA playoff match.<br />The scene at airports might best capture the renewed frenzy of American life. On May 25, over 1.4 million travelers passed through TSA checkpoints. That figure a year ago? Just 264,843. And life is only going to get busier from here. A February study by the online wedding website the Knot projected that 2021 will be an extraordinarily busy year for weddings, driven by the backlog of engaged couples who’ve been frustratedly deferring their plans.

Co-founders and co-CEOs Neil Blumenthal and Dave Gilboa said the 11-year-old business has faced down its toughest year and increased its sales.<br />Warby Parker raised $245 million from private investors last fall, snagging a $3 billion valuation—higher than before—and sparking talk of a possible initial public offering. The company has been profitable since 2019, according to a person familiar with the matter, but hasn’t disclosed financial results.<br />Messrs. Blumenthal and Gilboa recently spoke with The Wall Street Journal about how Warby Parker adapted during the pandemic, the future of eyewear shopping and their potential IPO plans.

      <td>HP and Dell have been the hottest stocks in tech, but fears the personal-computer market is peaking are starting to weigh</td>
      <td>Life has been good lately for  HP  and  Dell Technologies .  Many investors seem to think the PC business is as good as it gets.<br />Booming demand for personal computers has made HP and  Dell  two of the strongest large-cap tech stocks so far this year. Before their latest quarterly reports late Thursday, HP was up 31% for the year, while Dell had jumped 36%. That far exceeds the performance of both  Microsoft  and  Apple —the market’s two most valued companies, who also have a fair amount of exposure to the PC market.<br />That set a high bar for the two companies’ results for the fiscal quarter ended in April. But both came through. HP’s revenue surged 27% year-over-year to about $15.9 billion, notching the company’s best growth since splitting with its  Hewlett Packard Enterprise  sibling in 2015. Dell’s revenue jumped 12% year-over-year to about $24.5 billion. Both well exceeded Wall Street’s estimates. PC sales account for a little over half of Dell’s total revenue and a little over 60% of HP’s.<br />Still, both stocks fell Friday following their results. HP shares fell 9% as analysts noted that its per-share earnings projection for the fiscal year ending in October reflects pressure coming in the second half of the year. The company racked that up to “increased costs in commodities and logistics.” It also said the continuing chip shortage will hurt its ability to meet demand in both PCs and printers. Dell shares slipped by 1.1%, as the company also cited supply constraints as a factor for July quarter revenue to be “slightly below our normal sequential pattern over the past few years.”<br />PCs have been a mature business for years; the sector saw unit sales shrink globally every year from 2012-2018, according to both Gartner and IDC, which track PC sales. Microsoft’s end of support for Windows 7 sparked a small upgrade cycle in 2019, but the pandemic really juiced demand, as workers and students sent home rushed to equip themselves. Unit sales of PC and Chromebooks jumped 13% to 302.6 million in 2020, and surged by 55% year-over-year in the first quarter, according to IDC’s data.</td>

Treasury officials said Friday that some campaign proposals need more work and others may appear in future plans.<br />The deduction “just seems to be kind of without redeeming qualities and frankly, I was a little surprised that the Biden administration didn’t propose curtailing it,” said William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a left-leaning Washington think tank.<br />Kevin Kuhlman, vice president of government relations at the National Federation of Independent Business, said he had been bracing for the deduction to be removed.</td>

But powerful as Smith’s limber Tanktotems, confrontational Zigs and athletic Cubi—to name only a few series—are, they are not the whole story.<br />Smith was a painter before he was a sculptor, he often said that he “belonged” with painters, and he continually explored the transformative effect of color on three-dimensional structures, aspiring, he said, to combine painting and sculpture into a new, superior art form. Throughout his too-short working life—he died in 1965 at age 59, in an automobile accident—Smith concentrated on sculpture, but he also drew and painted in a wide range of materials and techniques, dividing his day into a proletarian double shift, making sculpture in the factory-like space where he constructed in steel, and drawing and painting in what he called his “clean studio.”<br />Smith used photography both to record and transform his sculpture, capturing constructions in different lights and weathers, and making modest works appear monumental. He made reliefs, designed medals, and experimented with stone and casting in bronze. He tossed ideas back and forth in different mediums, testing the potential of imagined forms as drawings, expanding them and contextualizing them in paintings, realizing them in three dimensions, and photographing them—not necessarily in that order.</td>

On the East Coast, Mr. Vakil says his clients typically work in the finance and consulting sectors; on the West Coast, most are working in the tech industry. The average household he works with holds $250,000 in assets and falls between the ages of 25 and 45.<br />Many of these workers may have struggled with stagnating wages and huge student loan debts earlier in their careers.

      <td>The labor-market recovery after the coronavirus pandemic and related shutdowns is playing out unevenly across the U.S., from states where there are five openings for every unemployed worker to several where historically high jobless rates persist.<br />In some regions, including less populated areas that imposed fewer Covid-19 restrictions—states such as Utah and the Dakotas—the labor market is red hot, with many employers struggling to fill open jobs. Elsewhere, including in urban areas and tourist hubs that have been slower to ease restrictions—such as New York and Hawaii—labor demand is rebounding more gradually, making the shortages of workers less acute.<br />The northern Mountain West, the Plains, and northern New England stand out as having especially tight labor markets, with about three open positions for every one unemployed job seeker in April, according to an analysis by job search site ZipRecruiter.<br />Several factors are contributing to the labor shortages across the country. They include enhanced unemployment benefits that might provide a financial disincentive to take low-wage jobs, still-limited schools and child-care availability keeping parents home, and fear of Covid-19. In addition to the extent of government restrictions placed on businesses amid the pandemic, additional regional features help distinguish the hotter labor markets from the cooler.<br />All three hot regions had below average unemployment even before the pandemic, though different reasons are behind today’s tight labor market.</td>

The lawsuits involve a distinctive dark-green-and-yellow earplug designed to fully block noise if inserted into the ear in one direction, with the other side intended to let in nearby voices but shield the ear from harmful ballistic noises.<br />The first trial ended with a $7.1 million verdict for three veterans who blamed the earplugs for hearing loss and tinnitus, or a ringing in the ears.<br />3M stopped selling the earplugs in 2015 and has stood by the safety of the product. In 2018, the company reached a $9.1 million settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, without admitting to any liability, to resolve allegations in a whistleblower complaint that 3M failed to disclose deficiencies in the product.<br />The majority of the claims have been consolidated in front of U.S. District Judge M. Casey Rodgers in Pensacola, Fla., in a process known as multidistrict litigation. The judge selected plaintiffs for three so-called bellwether trials, which will help give both sides a sense of how juries react to the claims.</td>

It didn’t accuse them of fraud.<br />The SEC’s lawsuit seeks to have the defendants give back the money they made and to pay civil monetary penalties.<br />BitConnect was a digital asset created in 2016 and sold in exchange for bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency. BitConnect told investors it would profitably trade their bitcoin using an automated “trading bot” and required the currency to be locked up for terms ranging from four to 10 months, according to the SEC’s lawsuit. BitConnect eventually lost 92% of its value, and investors lost all or nearly all of their funds in the lending program, the SEC’s lawsuit said. Thousands invested in BitConnect.<br />The SEC sued BitConnect promoters Trevon Brown of Myrtle Beach, S.C., Craig Grant of Kissimmee, Fla., Ryan Maasen of Tulsa, Okla., and Michael Noble of Pacific Palisades, Calif. Regulators also sued Joshua Jeppesen of East Falmouth, Mass., who allegedly was a liaison between BitConnect and the promoters.

      <td>A blowout for the ages on everything but defense and security.</td>
      <td>Happy Memorial Day or should we say Covid Liberation Day. President Biden is celebrating with the $6 trillion budget he released Friday that, in its willful magnitude, is unprecedented in American peacetime history. Democrats with their narrow majorities in Congress have no mandate for this, but they plan to jam most of it through anyway.<br />As the pandemic finally eases due to vaccines, the emergency spending of the last two fiscal years should recede. The booming economy doesn’t need it. Consumers are flush with Covid relief payments and demand is soaring. Yet Mr. Biden wants to keep using the cover of Covid to sneak through an expansion of government that would be historic and permanent.<br />The nearby chart on spending and taxes as a share of GDP tells the larger fiscal story. World War II was the only comparable period with so much spending and new debt as the last two years. But once the war ended, military spending fell. Economic growth slowly reduced government debt as a share of GDP.<br />Not this time. If Mr. Biden gets his way, spending in fiscal 2022 will still be $6 trillion, which is some $2 trillion more than before the pandemic in 2019. Then spending will keep rising and remain a little under 25% of GDP for the rest of the decade. That level has never been reached in a single year since World War II, and the postwar pre-Covid average was 19.4%.<br />Even this level of spending is surely understated since much of it will finance Mr. Biden’s new cradle-to-grave federal entitlements for child care, paid family leave, community college and more. These are mandatory programs that don’t require an annual Congressional appropriation.</td>

      <td>The aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan will deploy from its home port in Japan to the Middle East this summer to support the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. The move came at the request of U.S. Central Command and was approved by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.<br />The Reagan’s deployment undermines the claim—made by the past three American presidents—that the Indo-Pacific is America’s priority. It also suggests that the Biden administration is conducting a phantom withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan—removing boots on the ground to fulfill a campaign promise to end “forever wars,” but replacing ground operations with other forces conducting similar missions at great difficulty and expense.<br />A carrier has been present in the Middle East for years, which is wearing out the Navy’s carrier force. The USS Abraham Lincoln spent more than 220 days operating in the region on a 295-day deployment that ended in January 2020, the longest of any carrier since the end of the Cold War.<br />The USS Eisenhower, currently operating in the Middle East, is on a “double pump” back-to-back deployment. The carrier spent more than 200 consecutive days at sea on its previous deployment. It can no longer put off repairs, and due to years of high carrier demand, the only carrier available to backfill it is the Reagan. That means the U.S. won’t have an aircraft carrier in the Indo-Pacific for months.<br />The Pentagon frequently touts the Indo-Pacific as its priority theater; Mr. Austin has said, “China is our pacing threat.” Indeed, the 2018 National Defense Strategy said that if necessary, the U.S. should accept risk in the Middle East and other theaters to focus assets and resources in the Pacific.</td>

A court judgment released Friday shows that a judge penalized former pro-democracy lawmaker and journalist Claudia Mo for speaking to Western journalists, including our own Jillian Melchior.<br />Police arrested Ms. Mo, along with nearly the entire opposition movement, in January. She and 46 others are charged with conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law for organizing or participating in an informal pro-democracy primary election last July. Judge Esther Toh denied Ms. Mo bail in April, and the world learned why on Friday.<br />The national security law prohibits “collusion” with vaguely defined foreign forces and states that defendants may not receive bail “unless the judge has sufficient grounds” to believe that they “will not continue to commit acts endangering national security.” As a reason to keep Ms. Mo behind bars, prosecutor Maggie Yang described Ms. Mo’s WhatsApp correspondence with these pages, the New York Times, Bloomberg and the BBC.<br />In a court filing explaining her denial of bail, Judge Toh quotes from an Oct. 1, 2020, conversation Ms. Mo had with Ms. Melchior about 12 Hong Kongers who were captured after they tried to escape to Taiwan by boat.<br />Ms. Mo told Ms. Melchior: “The detention and treatment of the 12 Hong Kong protesters serve as the ultimate warning and threat to Hongkongers about what one can face if you’re caught. The new security law and the spate of arrests have worked as a scare tactic, probably fairly successfully—at sending a persistent political chill around the city.” Every word of that is true, and it was hardly a secret.</td>

      <td>The long pandemic year has widened the policy divide between Democratic and Republican states, with the latter generally resisting long lockdowns and doing better economically. Now Oklahoma is rewarding its citizens by cutting taxes to make the state more competitive.<br />Republicans control the House, Senate and governorship in the Sooner State, and last week Gov. Kevin Stitt signed the tax bills into law. Effective Jan. 1, the corporate income tax will drop to 4% from 6%, and the legislation also cuts individual income tax rates across the board by 0.25 percentage points. The top rate falls to 4.75%. These could amount to as much as $347 million in tax relief for fiscal year 2022.<br />“We walked into a situation this session where we did not have a fiscal crisis because we kept the state’s economy open to the greatest extent possible while caring for the health and safety of the citizens of this state,” says Oklahoma House Speaker Charles McCall. The state had projected a $1.4 billion revenue decline in the dark days of spring 2020 but began its 2021 legislative session with a $1.6 billion surplus. “It was the perfect time to institute some tax relief,” says Mr. McCall.<br />The new rates mean Oklahoma will now rank sixth lowest among states that assess personal income tax and tied with Missouri as second lowest among states with a corporate income tax, according to the Tax Foundation. Oklahoma requires either a three-fourths legislative majority or a voter referendum to raise taxes, so the cuts have some staying power.<br />Oklahoma is betting that its low taxes will attract businesses and newcomers. It still trails neighboring Texas, an economic powerhouse without an income tax. But its rates are competitive with those of other states in the region. The Sooner State joins Montana, Idaho and Iowa as states that have cut income taxes since the pandemic began, according to the Tax Foundation.</td>

For example, the EEOC said as a reasonable accommodation, an unvaccinated employee entering the workplace might wear a face mask, work at a social distance or be given the opportunity to telework.<br />The new guidelines also say that federal laws don’t prevent or limit incentives that can be offered to workers to voluntarily take the vaccine. And employers that are administering vaccines to their employees may also offer incentives, as long as the incentives aren’t coercive.<br />The updated guidance is intended to answer frequently asked questions, EEOC Chairwoman Charlotte Burrows said in a statement.

      <td>I was 10 when mobs attacked the Jewish community of Baghdad, my community, with cruel and unimaginable violence. Rioters maimed, raped, killed and robbed the unsuspecting Jews. This massacre, which began June 1, 1941, was called the Farhud, Arabic for “violent dispossession” or pogrom.<br />The seeds of the Farhud had been sown two months earlier. On April 1, a pro-Nazi coup d’état overthrew the pro-British Iraqi government and seized power. The coup was staged by Rashid Ali al Gaylani, an Arab nationalist and former Iraqi prime minister, supported by four army generals, and aided by Fritz Grobba, a former German ambassador to Iraq. This dangerous group was further stoked by the grand mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al Husseini, who deeply hated the Jews. Anti-Semitic propaganda began to appear in the daily newspapers and in broadcasts on Radio Baghdad. It was intended to inflame the Muslim population and rally support for the new regime.<br />The Jewish community bore the brunt of this explosive combination of Arab nationalism, Nazi propaganda and anti-Semitism. In the weeks after the coup my family stayed home most of the time, huddled around the large console radio. We listened with disbelief to reports of Jews being arrested and accused of anti-Iraqi sentiment and of spying for the British. I shook just thinking of the torture being carried out to extract false confessions.<br />On May 31, 1941, the British army arrived at the outskirts of Baghdad. The pro-Nazi government collapsed quickly, but al Gaylani and his co-conspirators escaped to Iran. The Jewish community in Baghdad felt a sense of relief, especially as it coincided with the eve of the Shavuot festival, commemorating the time when God gave us the Ten Commandments. We had good reason to rejoice.<br />But that high spirit didn’t last long, and joy reverted to pain and sorrow. The absence of a functioning government created a power vacuum. Across the country, chaos and lawlessness followed.</td>

Executives also deliberated over having Mr. Blatt address the allegation, a draft resignation letter Mr. Blatt sent to independent public-relations representatives showed.<br />“We need to get specific on the date of when the Board adopted a CEO transition plan, and it needs to pre-date the incident for the story to be credible should all of this come to light,” said IAC communications chief Valerie Combs in a July 7, 2017, email to IAC Chief Executive Joey Levin, according to the filing.<br />Three weeks after the exchange, a press release announcing Mr. Blatt’s resignation as CEO of both Match Group and dating app Tinder didn’t mention the allegation or an investigation that Match Group conducted. IAC Chairman Barry Diller said in the press release that Mr. Blatt had approached him nearly a year earlier about a potential job change and that the CEO’s departure came after months of discussion and planning.<br />IAC, which separated from Match Group last year, said in a statement that an investigation by Match Group’s board with two outside law firms found no violation of law or company policy. Based on the investigation’s findings, there was no cause for Mr. Blatt to resign and, therefore, no cause to disclose it. “The company has nothing to hide,” a spokesperson for IAC said in a statement.</td>

      <td>The news business is headed for trouble if it won’t control its biases as other professions do.</td>
      <td>On what basis was the lab leak theory ruled out for months by the media despite the lack of any evidence or logic for ruling it out? We’re bad journalists, has been the unembarrassed answer from the media this week in a wide array of print and online publications as well as National Public Radio.<br />We in the press dismissed the lab theory because of an appeal to authority: When anti-Donald Trump spokespeople ridiculed it, that was good enough for us. We dismissed it because of the equivocation fallacy: “Chinese” is a word that can be used to denote a racial category. Therefore it was racist to suggest a Chinese lab might have leaked the virus.<br />We engaged in availability bias: Instead of letting the evidence or lack thereof guide us, we adopted the attitudes of public figures whose political, cultural and social status we wished to emulate. Most insidiously, we relied on a fallacy sometimes known as “alleged certainty”: “The question remains open” is not a headline that attracts clicks. A headline that does is “lab leak theory again proves Trump’s incompetence.”<br />Alas, the question of Covid’s origins not only remains open; in all likelihood it will defy final resolution unless and until the Chinese government is forthcoming with its own records, which it has shown a predilection not to be. The lab leak hypothesis has an unsettling corollary. In nature, the giant mixing bowl of natural selection is mechanism enough to explain how a virus adapted to bats might mutate to become infectious in humans. If it escaped from a lab, how did such a virus acquire the ability to infect humans? “Gain of function” experimentation was a controversial practice among virologists long before Covid. Multiple accidental releases of dangerous viruses from highly secure labs have been recorded in the past. The SARS virus has escaped six times since being identified in 2003. The 1977 global flu pandemic is believed to have originated in the escape from an unknown lab of a specimen collected in the 1950s.<br />Unfortunately the question of Covid’s origins is likely to be adjudicated for the foreseeable future on circumstantial evidence alone, thanks to Beijing’s recalcitrance. Where is China’s own 1,000-page, data-filled report on the virus’s emergence? China is home to the world’s leading bat virus experts. It should own the science here. Its failure to issue any findings at all is itself circumstantial evidence of a kind.</td>

      <td>Shares of AMC Entertainment have soared 125% this week, with investor enthusiasm building anew on social media</td>
      <td>Shares of  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  finished Friday with their best weekly gain in four months, surging 116% for the week, in a rally that has once again astounded analysts, enriched individual investors and punished Wall Street traders betting against the company.<br />The movie-theater chain company, whose stock closed last year just above $2, finished Friday at $26.12, giving the shares a year-to-date gain of more than 1,100% and the company a market capitalization to of nearly $11.8 billion. The rally marks an astounding turnaround for a company that last year was reeling from the coronavirus pandemic and trying to stave off bankruptcy.<br />Once again fueling this week’s rise: enthusiastic individual investors who have banded together on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, in Discord chat rooms and in text chains with friends. Throughout the week, hashtags including #AMCSTRONG and #AMCSqueeze splashed across  Twitter ,  with many predicting more gains ahead.<br />The chatter helped drive $209 million of net inflows from individual investors between Monday and Thursday, according to Vanda Research’s VandaTrack, more than 15 times the amount seen during the same period of April’s final week.<br />AMC’s shares closed Friday down 1.5% after surging as high as 38% earlier in the day. But the loss wasn’t enough to deter individual investors. Across social media, individual traders on Friday afternoon encouraged others to hold their positions.</td>

      <td>Summer camps should encourage adolescents who aren’t fully vaccinated to wear face masks, especially indoors</td>
      <td>Children who are fully vaccinated don’t need to wear face masks or maintain physical distancing from one another at camp this summer, federal health officials said Friday, in their latest move to relax pandemic guidelines for people who have received shots.<br />Yet camps should still encourage children and staff who aren’t fully vaccinated to wear a mask indoors, as well as outdoors in areas where Covid-19 is spreading, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.<br />The agency updated its recommendations as school is letting out and summer camps are getting into swing across the country. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a Covid-19 vaccine for adolescents earlier this month, prompting the CDC to make the updates. Some camps said they would now rush to make last-minute changes to take the new guidance into account.<br />“When we have the opportunity where everybody is fully vaccinated, you can get back to no masks, no distancing and a normal camp experience,” said Erin Sauber-Schatz, who heads the CDC’s Community Interventions and Critical Populations Task Force.<br />The CDC advised two weeks ago that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear face masks or physically distance indoors or outdoors, in large groups or small. That guidance created many questions, including what campers, travelers and schools should do, given that those settings involve people being in close quarters.</td>

      <td>The divisive issue has become a top priority for Democrats</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said the Senate would take up voting-rights legislation during the last week of its June work period, a major step for a policy opposed by Republicans and one that hasn’t yet drawn the full support of his conference.<br />Most legislation needs 60 votes to pass the Senate, and Democrats control 50 seats in the evenly divided chamber. In scheduling the vote and others that lack bipartisan support, Mr. Schumer is signaling that he is willing to pivot away from areas that unify the Democratic caucus or have bipartisan support and put the emphasis on more politically challenging measures.<br />“The next few weeks will be hard and will test our resolve as a Congress and a conference,” he said Friday.<br />The Democrats’ progressive wing has grown increasingly impatient over the lack of action in the Senate, where Mr. Schumer has chosen to devote recent months to bipartisan initiatives, like a water-infrastructure bill that passed nearly unanimously and a measure to help the U.S. maintain its lead in technology.<br />The voting measure, known as S-1 because it was the first bill introduced in the Senate this session, lacks bipartisan support and hasn’t drawn the backing of Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.). But it is viewed by the Democratic base as essential if the party is to maintain control of the House and the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections.</td>

      <td>In the decades following the American Revolution, the governments that counted were those that met in state capitals.</td>
      <td>Alan Taylor is one of America’s most distinguished historians. He is the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Professor at the University of Virginia, a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize in History and the author of 10 previous books, nearly all dealing with early American history. Mr. Taylor describes this one, “American Republics: A Continental History of the United States, 1783-1850,” as a sequel to his two earlier books, “American Colonies: The Settling of North America” (2001) and “American Revolutions: A Continental History, 1750-1804” (2016). His book is written in clear, readable prose designed for readers with little or no prior knowledge of the period, and the work has touches of wokeness, which helps to fit it nicely into this extraordinary moment in our history.<br />Mr. Taylor did not intend his book to be a comprehensive account of the antebellum decades; he calls it “a concise introduction,” covering “some conventional topics,” including Alexander Hamilton’s financial program, Thomas Jefferson’s attempt to diminish the size of the federal government, Andrew Jackson’s war on the national bank and the efforts of Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth to challenge the slave system of the South. Although Mr. Taylor’s history of the period inevitably features the United States, he signals his divergence from a parochial and xenophobic account by including brief forays into the histories of the countries bordering the United States. These are left out of the usual histories of the United States, and Mr. Taylor’s use of them enriches his history. The presence of the border countries in his chronicle, and his correct belief that the American governments that counted most were those of the separate states, and not the federal government, account for the plural “Republics” in his title.<br />Mr. Taylor’s introduction sets the tone for the book. He never fails to point out the discrepancies between the ideals of the white Americans and the sordid realities of their behavior. Some, for example, found the class divisions in Washington, D.C., to be as severe as anywhere in the world, which leads Mr. Taylor to conclude that Americans, “while denying the power of class in public life, . . . practiced it with a vengeance in private circles.” He uses Washington, D.C., as a base and compares it with other capitals of the various nations and empires surrounding the United States. It does not come out well.<br />Not only did Washington remain raw and unpopulated throughout the period, but one third of its people remained enslaved. Mexico City was nearly 300 years older than Washington, and 20 times bigger and 40 times grander, and it had no slaves and claimed to have dissolved all racial distinctions. Port-au-Prince, the capital of the black republic Haiti, the second republic in the New World, suffered from earthquakes, hurricanes and wars, but, says Mr. Taylor, at least its people were free, and it was more populous than Washington. Even York (later Toronto), the capital of Upper Canada, grew faster than the U.S. capital. The native Cherokees created a republic, too, and in the 1820s built a capital, New Echota, in northwestern Georgia. It was, alas, soon overrun by white migrants eager to build cotton plantations worked by enslaved African-Americans.<br />During the decades following the Revolution, the United States was weak and vulnerable to pressure from their neighbors. Mr. Taylor rightly stresses that the country was not a nation, but a union of states each keenly conscious of its autonomy and very suspicious of one another. As the author nicely puts it, “mutual distrust was the bond of union.” Americans tended to avoid the term “nation” and used “union” instead. But that union was fragile, and the threat of disunion was constant. Most realized that slavery was, as one newspaper editor put it, “the weak point of our Union,” as it proved to be.</td>

      <td>The 1976 Hyde Amendment, included in spending legislation for decades, is backed by most Republicans</td>
      <td>President Biden’s budget proposal removes language banning the use of federal dollars for abortions in most cases, fulfilling a campaign pledge and setting up a fight in Congress, where most Republicans are opposed to the change.<br />The president’s budget, released Friday, doesn’t include the 1976 Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortion with exceptions for victims of rape or incest or if the mother’s life is in danger. The language has been included in spending legislation for decades, and Mr. Biden had supported the amendment for years before reversing his position during his presidential campaign. Abortion-rights advocates and many Democrats had urged him to do so.<br />Abortion opponents say the amendment ensures federal tax dollars don’t go to paying for the procedure, while advocates for access to abortions say it disproportionately affects low-income women and women of color who are Medicaid recipients.<br />The decision from the president comes as some Republican-led states add new restrictions on abortions and the Supreme Court prepares to consider the legality of a Mississippi abortion law that sought to ban the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy.<br />While this marked the first time in decades that a president sought to strip the language, the change wasn’t highlighted in a budget fact sheet released by the White House. Some abortion-rights advocates have pushed for Mr. Biden to be more vocal on the issue, noting that he didn’t use the word abortion in a statement marking the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision recognizing a woman’s right to have an abortion, or in his recent address to a joint session of Congress.</td>

While votes are still being counted,  BlackRock Inc.,   State Street Corp.  and Vanguard Group have said publicly they wielded votes for investors in favor of at least two dissident directors.<br />The proxy battle was the biggest test yet of Wall Street’s receptivity to a campaign about the risks posed to business from climate change and the transition away from fossil fuels. Large investors have been criticized for being all talk and no action on getting the companies they invest in to change their policies around sustainability. Exxon’s yearslong refusal to make board directors available for frank conversations irked investors.<br />Energy giant Exxon fought hard to fend off the dissident slate. Company officials continued to lobby shareholders even as Wednesday’s annual meeting neared adjournment.<br />Exxon said it welcomed the new directors, Gregory Goff and Kaisa Hietala, and looked forward to working with them. “With almost three million shareholders, it’s not surprising we heard a wide range of views, and many supported the work that we’re doing to improve earnings and cash flow capacity, as well as the work to advance the company to a lower carbon future,” a spokesman said.<br />“Today, we heard shareholders communicate a desire for ExxonMobil to further these efforts. We’re well-positioned to do that.”</td>

      <td>No one is sure of the term’s origin or how it came to be applied to so many different kinds of illicit seizures</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />When Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko forced a  Ryanair  plane to land in order to arrest a dissident journalist who was on board, international outrage was swift. The CEO of Ryanair, based in Ireland, called the incident “a state-sponsored hijacking.” Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin and several other European Union leaders echoed the term.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki was more cautious. “I don’t have a new definition of what happened here,” she said, adding that the White House, while condemning the action, was “not legally ready to change any of the existing language” regarding the term “hijacking.”<br />Under a narrow definition of “hijacking,” what happened to the Ryanair flight might not count. It didn’t fit the typical scenario in which someone commandeers a plane from the inside, such as by coercing the pilot at gunpoint. (The flight, bound for Vilnius, was forced to divert to Minsk because authorities from Belarus claimed there was a bomb threat. The journalist Roman Protasevich was arrested on arrival.)<br />The meaning of “hijacking” has never been entirely straightforward, and the term’s origins, while dating back a little over a century, perplex etymologists to this day.</td>

      <td>The Korean Veterans Memorial pays tribute to former servicemen through a plain-spoken acknowledgment of the harshness of war.</td>
      <td><br />The Korean War ended more than two decades before the messy conclusion of the war in Vietnam. And yet a memorial to that earlier, “forgotten” war was dedicated only on July 27, 1995, 13 years after the completion on the National Mall of a wall of polished granite, etched with the names of those who died in Vietnam.<br />Maya Lin’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington—once so polemical—is now thought by many to be as close to reverential perfection as a war memorial can be. It has had fierce critics. Jim Webb, a Vietnam vet and U.S. senator, called it “a nihilistic slab of stone.” The wall is stark, even accusatory, and a bronze sculpture of three soldiers was added later to shush those who regarded Ms. Lin’s creation as too cerebral—even insufficiently heroic.<br />As if determined not to stoke such controversy, the Korean Veterans Memorial is, by contrast, stubbornly literal. A demotic American masterwork, it is plain-spoken and realist. It appeals to old-fashioned conceptions of what is heroic and admirable. Unlike the Vietnam Memorial, which yields its richness to those who meditate before it, the Korean Memorial fills even a child with awe—and it does so instantly, on first contact, as I found when I took my son to see it when he was 10 years old, a full decade ago. There is no sight quite like that of a small boy transfixed before statues that tower over him.<br />The monument—designed by Cooper-Lecky Architects of Washington—has many elements, including a Pool of Remembrance and a low-slung United Nations Wall that lists the 22 countries that joined the U.S. in its “police action” in Korea. Another wall, listing the names of the Americans who died, will be completed next year.</td>

      <td>An English cultural identity once nested quietly inside Britain. Now English nationalism is on the rise.</td>
      <td>How did the British become so excitable? Everyone who has observed British politics play out as a dance of dervishes since 2016—when Britain voted narrowly to bolt from the European Union—has been struck by how untethered from its age-old traits of stability, continuity and moderation the country has come to be.<br />As it wrestles with the effects of Brexit, which include the nitty-gritty of trade and travel as well as grander matters of identity and nationalism, Britain’s political system has combined “feverish activity with almost complete paralysis.” This “negative dialectic,” say Ailsa Henderson and Richard Wyn Jones—professors of politics at the University of Edinburgh and Cardiff University, respectively—has served to “diminish the country’s much vaunted global reputation.” The world now looks at Britain and asks why its politics is so much like that of the less fortunate lands on which the Brits have gazed (heretofore forgivably) with condescension.<br />The motor behind this unseemly change is “Englishness.” Ms. Henderson and Mr. Wyn Jones use this word as the title of their book, aiming to capture the “political force transforming Britain” (as their subtitle declares). Brexit, they argue, was less a victory for Britishness than for Englishness, which now expresses itself as a form of English nationalism fueled powerfully—but not exclusively—by Euroskeptic sentiment.<br />Although the two terms are often conflated by the English themselves, Englishness is not the same as Britishness. The former has tended to be seen as an ethnic identity, the latter as a civic one. It would be wrong, the authors say, to regard one as bad and the other as good, for the connotations that attach to both terms are complex and contradictory. Some see Britishness as “outward looking, the identity of choice for those interested in the UK on a world stage,” in contrast to an “insular, self-interested Englishness”—hence the disparaging phrase “Little Englander.” Others, by contrast, distinguish between a “peaceful and gentle” Englishness and a “colonizing and violent” Britishness.<br />In either case, the values or symbols associated with Englishness tend to be cultural: fair play, the English language, a sense of humor, the green and pleasant countryside. Those who favor a British identity are likely to focus on political elements, like the Union Jack, the Crown and Parliament.</td>

      <td>Regarding “In Israel, the Violent Legacy of 1948” (Review, May 22): The Journal has waded into a scholars’ mine field. Historians on all sides of this dispute accuse one another of grave inaccuracies and distortions.<br />Benny Morris presents a version of the events of 1947-48 that may be near the middle of the debate but isn’t in any way a consensus view. He represents a specific school of thought on this issue, usually referred to as the “New Historians,” that emerged in the 1980s. This school claims to give a more accurate account than the “traditional” Israeli one, which says that most of the Arabs who fled did so under pressure from Arab military leaders, who wanted to clear the field for a war of elimination against the Jews, and who promised the departing Arab civilians that they would be back in their homes within a few weeks.<br />But this traditional account is still far from being definitely disproved, as shown by the work of such scholars as Efraim Karsh. Nor is Prof. Morris free from severe criticism by academics at the other end of the ideological spectrum, such as Ilan Pappé, who argue that he falls far short of presenting a full exposé of Jewish/Israeli war crimes committed during this period.<br />David Hoffman<br />Jerusalem</td>
