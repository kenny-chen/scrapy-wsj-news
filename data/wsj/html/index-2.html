Earlier this month, the social-media company disclosed for the first time that it had an average of 52 million daily active users as of October, up 44% from a year earlier.<br />User-created video is behind the success of the hit app TikTok, which has inspired Facebook Inc.’s Instagram and  Snap Inc.’s  Snapchat to introduce similar services. Also popular are platforms that let users broadcast live video such as Amazon.com Inc.’s Twitch and  Alphabet Inc.’s  YouTube.<br />“The transition to video will be bigger than the transition to mobile,” said Reddit Chief Executive and co-founder Steve Huffman. “We’re still only at the beginning.”</td>

      <td>Drastic changes caused by the pandemic have created a totally different job landscape in 2020, affecting productivity, diversity, mental health and more</td>
      <td>We worked from our kitchen tables, or donned masks to do our jobs. Our vocabulary changed: We learned what PPE was, and that some roles were essential. Protests, the racial justice movement and a historic election shook the country. We felt stressed, lonely; we lost our jobs or had to leave them.<br />It’s been a wild year that’s transformed work. To try to capture the breadth of what’s changed, and understand where we might be heading, I turned to the numbers: surveys, economic data and research papers.<br />They tell the story of women dropping out of the workforce in droves, companies catalyzed—at least on the surface—by the death of George Floyd, and a country where a quarter of households have had someone laid off. They point to a future where those who don’t have to don’t go into an office, at least not every day. Here’s our year at work, by the numbers.<br />We’re getting our work done, but we feel pretty miserable. In a September survey of 330 human resources leaders by the Conference Board, 47% of respondents reported an increase in productivity at their companies, while only 13% reported a drop. But 60% said their employees are working more hours and 63% said their employees are spending more time in meetings. Four out of 10 reported more mental health problems among workers.<br />Part of it is surely the work itself—we’re exhausted from back-to-back video calls, without even a commute as buffer between work and life. We’re scared of losing our livelihoods. And then there’s the health crisis: 78% of participants in an American Psychological Association survey of 3,409 adults said the pandemic was a significant source of stress, so it’s no surprise that’s bleeding into our work lives.</td>

      <td>LONDON—John le Carré, the spy-turned-novelist whose elegant and intricate narratives defined the Cold War espionage thriller and brought acclaim to a genre critics had once ignored, has died. He was 89.<br />Mr. le Carré’s literary agency, Curtis Brown, said Sunday that he died in Cornwall, southwest England, on Saturday after a short illness. The death wasn’t related to Covid-19.<br />In such classics as “The Spy Who Came In from the Cold,” “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” and “The Honourable Schoolboy,” Mr. Le Carré combined terse, but lyrical, prose with the kind of complexity expected in literary fiction. His books grappled with betrayal, moral compromise and the psychological toll of a secret life. In the quiet, watchful spymaster George Smiley, he created one of 20th-century fiction’s iconic characters—a decent man at the heart of a web of deceit.<br />For Mr. le Carré, the world of espionage was a “metaphor for the human condition.”<br />Born David Cornwell, Mr. le Carré worked for Britain’s intelligence service before turning his experience into fiction.</td>

The hack of Commerce systems includes the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a unit that works on technology policy issues, the person familiar with the matter said.<br />The apparent scope of the hacking operation and the suspected Russian involvement has alarmed national security officials in the Trump administration as well as executives at FireEye, some of whom view it as more significant than a routine foreign cyber espionage, people familiar with the matter said.</td>

      <td>Its strategists promote an identity politics campaign against an op-ed on Jill Biden’s use of ‘Dr.’</td>
      <td>Joe Biden says it is “time to heal” America’s divisions after the Trump presidency, and The Wall Street Journal has praised him for saying so. Presumably he intends less rancor with the press as part of this mandate, but on that score my run-in with the Biden team this weekend was very Trumpian.<br />The catalyst was our Saturday op-ed by Joseph Epstein, “Is There a Doctor in the White House? Not if You Need an M.D.” Mr. Epstein, a longtime contributor, criticized the habit of people with Ph.D.s or other doctorates calling themselves “Dr.” as highfalutin, using Jill Biden as Exhibit A. Mr. Epstein can be acerbic, and his piece began: “Madame First Lady—Mrs. Biden—Jill—kiddo: a bit of advice on what may seem like a small but I think is a not unimportant matter. Any chance you might drop the ‘Dr.’ before your name?”<br />This has triggered a flood of media and  Twitter  criticism, including demands that I retract the piece, apologize personally to Mrs. Biden, ban Mr. Epstein for all time, and resign and think upon my sins. The complaints began as a trickle but became a torrent after the Biden media team elevated Mr. Epstein’s work in what was clearly a political strategy.<br />Mrs. Biden’s press spokesperson, Michael LaRosa, issued a tweet in early afternoon: “@jamestaranto, you and the @WSJ should be embarrassed to print the disgusting and sexist attack on @DrBiden running on the @WSJopinion page. If you had any respect for women at all you would remove this repugnant display of chauvinism from your paper and apologize to her.” James Taranto is the Journal’s op-ed editor, but I am responsible for the opinion pages.<br />Elizabeth Alexander, the soon-to-be first lady’s communications director, also chimed in: “Sexist and shameful. Be better @wsj.” Ms. Alexander called me after her tweet to register her disapproval personally, which is fine. Her job is to flack for her boss, and part of my job is to listen to complaints. We had a frank exchange of views, as the diplomats say, and I invited her to send in a letter for publication.</td>

      <td>Reagan’s secretary of state also worked to restore balance to the American relationship with China.</td>
      <td>Helping to forge the relationship between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev made George Shultz—who turned 100 on Sunday—one of the most consequential secretaries of state of the 20th century. His expert diplomacy led to a peaceful end of the Cold War, bringing freedom to some 400 million Soviet subjects—something that seemed an impossible dream when Reagan took office in 1981. But the triumph of the Reagan-Shultz working relationship went beyond management of the Soviet challenge. The two men helped initiate a democratic wave that swept through Asia and Latin America in the 1980s and ’90s.<br />Working directly for Mr. Shultz on Asia in the 1980s, I saw how he and Reagan righted a U.S.-China relationship that had become unbalanced. A progression of American officials had forgotten that Beijing needed us far more than we needed them to deal with the Soviets. “I am not here to play cards. I am here to build our bilateral relationship” based on our mutual interests, Mr. Shultz announced during his first visit to China in February 1983. His statement conveyed to China’s leaders that he valued the relationship for the benefits it could bring to our two countries, not because of Chinese hints that they might move closer to the Soviets.<br />Mr. Shultz also restored balance to the U.S.-China relationship by demonstrating through words and deeds that U.S. allies—particularly Japan—came first, and that he would prefer no deal to a bad one. An incident during that same visit demonstrated his readiness to walk away if pushed too far. At a large luncheon with American businessmen in Beijing, Mr. Shultz’s temper slowly rose as his hosts pressed him with the official Chinese position on issue after issue. Finally, someone asked why American companies weren’t allowed to sell nuclear reactors to China while their European competitors faced no such restrictions. Mr. Shultz replied calmly, and with decided coolness, that the limits were necessary because of “legitimate concern about nuclear proliferation. Your question suggests in rather cavalier fashion that you brush it off. I don’t brush it off.”<br />Then he walked out, commenting as we left that Chinese intelligence services would report all the pressure he was under from American businessmen. Unspoken was the thought that they would also have to report: George Shultz has steel in his backbone.<br />A few months ago on these pages Mr. Shultz reflected on how Xi Jinping is turning the clock back to the Maoist economic model while “wrecking Hong Kong” and in the process losing “international trust.” He acknowledged with some obvious pain that “today’s China is different from the one I once worked with constructively.”</td>

      <td>A stockpile of medications from Regeneron and Eli Lilly to prepare in case vaccines aren’t enough.</td>
      <td>The U.S. can buy a Covid insurance policy for next year. The federal government should scale up production of antibody drugs to make as many doses as possible. The Food and Drug Administration has cleared two such drugs, from Regeneron and  Eli Lilly ,  for emergency use. For newly diagnosed patients, they reduce the risk of severe disease.<br />Making them is relatively straightforward, but supply is limited because the government didn’t find enough manufacturing space in the spring. Regeneron and Lilly took extraordinary steps to increase their own production. They knew they had to make these drugs in the U.S., lest other nations try to nationalize production and pocket the medicines. Each company freed up much of its domestic manufacturing capacity by shifting production of other drugs to places like Europe. Each company also joined forces with another large manufacturer to secure additional production capacity— Amgen  teamed up with Eli Lilly, and Roche worked with Regeneron. The federal government relaxed certain rules to enable these collaborations. This will produce a combined supply of six million to seven million doses next year.<br />But that isn’t enough. Most biotech companies prepare for disruptions in manufacturing by freezing and stockpiling enough of their most profitable drugs to last about two years. Why not pay these plants to use their capacity for antibody production? Companies can dip into reserves to avoid creating a shortage of other important medicines.<br />A manufacturer can’t flip to making antibodies overnight. It’d take about six months to convert a facility to the Covid drug and another six months to return it to its original purpose. But a big facility that makes the Covid antibodies at full throttle for about eight months could rack up some 2.5 million doses.<br />The government can help backstop the risks to any manufacturer willing to become a contract manufacturer for the Covid medication. The government can agree to buy the antibody and stockpile it at a price that makes it worthwhile. Regeneron and Lilly would be paid to license their drugs for such an arrangement.</td>

      <td>Federal courts charge 10 cents a page to read public records.</td>
      <td>It’s been a season of federal lawsuits. There have been multiple actions by the Trump campaign and his allies to contest the election results. Google and  Facebook  are the subject of Justice Department antitrust actions. If you follow this stuff, you might be interested in reading the court records themselves—but it’ll cost you. Ten cents a page, according to the federal judiciary, even if you read them online.<br />That’s crazy. These are public records sitting in the public domain, and the judiciary is the only branch of the federal government that charges for online access. The latest White House press briefing will run you precisely zero dollars. Food and Drug Administration reports? Congressional roll call votes? All free.<br />The law authorizing judicial fees is a relic of a time before the internet, when accessing court records meant physically going to the courthouse and asking a clerk to copy them page by page. It should have been repealed decades ago when the records went online.<br />Last week the House passed the Open Courts Act, a bipartisan bill that would eliminate access fees and align the judiciary with the rest of the federal government. The Senate should follow suit and the president should sign this into law. Sadly, the chances of it happening soon are slim.<br />The benefits of making public records free are obvious. A core function of government is to assemble and disseminate information for the benefit of the public. The federal government, for all its shortcomings, is astonishingly good at this. Just ask the thousands of analysts on Wall Street who use Securities and Exchange Commission filings to price securities accurately. Or the legions of lawyers, journalists, scholars and members of the public who use federal records to anticipate and study new regulations, craft legal strategies for businesses big and small, and hold the government accountable.</td>

      <td>Beitar Jerusalem fans once shouted, ‘Death to the Arabs!’ Now one owns half the team.</td>
      <td>On Monday a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Nahyan, bought a 50% stake in an Israeli soccer team, Beitar Jerusalem, for $92 million. “Go Beitar!” the sheikh said. Actually, that’s a translation from—well, which language? The chant, using an Arabic word long incorporated into Hebrew, is “Yalla Beitar, yalla!”<br />Regrettably, that isn’t the only chant used by the team’s fans in the Israeli capital. Sometime in the 1990s I took my nephew to a Beitar soccer game at Teddy, its stadium named after Teddy Kollek, Jerusalem’s legendary mayor (1965-93). The chant “Death to the Arabs” started in the stands as soon as the game began. This was before Israeli television did documentaries on a Beitar fan group of hooligans calling itself “La Familia,” so it was completely new, and shocking, to me.<br />By then I was living in New York and following the Yankees more closely than any Israeli team, so I asked my nephew, a soccer maven, if the opposing team, Hapoel Haifa, had any Arab players. Nope. The chant was directed at no particular person. More like: Arabs are bad, so anyone playing against us is an Arab, and therefore death-worthy.<br />Beitar fans didn’t invent soccer hooliganism. Tottenham, a North London team identified with the Jews, has long been subject to anti-Semitic chants. Anti-Muslim and anti-African chants are sung at stadiums across Europe. Violence often ensues. Yet in Israel, where almost anything can be made into a referendum on political and national character, Beitar fans came to symbolize the worst in right-wing behavior.<br />Like all Israeli sports teams, Beitar Jerusalem has its origin in politics. Before Israel’s creation in 1948, athletic teams from major cities were party-affiliated. Maccabi represented the urban political center; Hapoel (“the worker”), the socialist Zionists; and Beitar, the “revisionist” right-wing faction from which Israel’s current ruling party, Likud, was born.</td>

If all goes well, my functional left thumb and the Covid vaccine will be available by summer.<br />One morning in January 2019, after dropping my daughter at school in New York City, I was struck by a large SUV and sent flying onto the pavement. The result was a severely broken left forearm, cuts, bruises and a damaged left thumb joint.<br />The driver hit the brakes on impact. I try not to think about the injuries I might have suffered otherwise. But the trauma still flashes in my brain every time I step off a curb or see a speeding car.<br />After months of unsuccessful physical therapy and the strain of the pandemic, this fall my husband, our daughter and I moved to a Washington suburb. Stable enough at last, I scheduled surgery for my thumb.<br />It was logical. The perfect time to repair my thumb was now while we’re isolated with nowhere to go. Thankfully, my husband and daughter have been at home with me. Otherwise, they’d be at work or school and I’d be stuck alone elevating my immobilized left hand as I watched cooking and craft shows and vicariously lived my old life.</td>

      <td>The human brain did not evolve for thinking. Its main purpose is to regulate our physical resources and ensure our survival.</td>
      <td>Are you doing something rash and unwise? Blame your “lizard brain.” Our reptilian instincts, which date from when we were all cold-blooded creatures around 300 million years ago, supposedly guide all of our primal urges, from throwing a punch to having an affair. Scientists have long posited that time and evolution stratified the human brain, with the oldest and crudest lizard layer lurking at the bottom, followed by the mammalian limbic system, which controls emotion, and topped by the uniquely human neocortex, which guides rational thought. This theory not only suggests that humans are the most evolved creatures, given our deluxe add-ons, but also explains the tug of war between our animal impulses and logical ambitions—an inner struggle Plato observed more than 2,000 years ago.<br />But according to Lisa Feldman Barrett, a professor at Northeastern University, the idea that the human brain developed a way to rein in our inner lizard is one of the most persistent and widespread errors in all of science.<br />In her slim but potent “Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain,” Ms. Barrett eagerly dispels this and other myths about the gray matter between our ears. She writes that the notion that the human brain has three discrete layers emerged in the mid-20th century, when the best technology available was a microscope. Based on visual inspection, the human brain does indeed look like it has parts that are not in the brains of other animals. But when scientists began examining the molecular makeup of brain cells in the 1990s, they discovered that neurons from various animal species may look different but often have the same genes, suggesting they share an evolutionary origin.<br />More dramatically, Ms. Barrett writes that scientists have recently discovered that the brains of all mammals—and most likely all vertebrates—follow a single manufacturing plan. This means every brain has the same essential ingredients but with species-specific mutations to aid survival in different environments. This, argues Ms. Barrett, undermines the idea that the human brain stands apart as the pinnacle of natural selection. Sure, our brain seems impressive, but we are simply one animal among many with a noodle adapted to the task of survival. “Other animals are not inferior to humans,” Ms. Barrett writes. “Your brain is not more evolved than a rat or lizard brain, just differently evolved.”<br />Ms. Barrett is not afraid of picking arguments. In her 2017 book “How Emotions Are Made,” she used research from her lab and others to contest decades of conventional wisdom about emotions. (Her basic argument is that emotions are not innate, universal experiences, but cultural concepts rooted in nuanced physical sensations that may differ from person to person.) With this book, she compellingly explains that much of what we thought we knew about the brain is wrong.</td>

      <td>After losing at the Supreme Court, he has no legal alternatives and ought to concede.</td>
      <td>The Electoral College meets Monday to cast its votes for President, officially marking Joe Biden as the election winner. President Trump’s legal challenges have run their course, and he and the rest of the Republican Party can help the country and themselves by acknowledging the result and moving on.<br />Mr. Trump’s last legal gasp came Friday evening when the Supreme Court declined to hear the Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn the election results in Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. As we predicted, the Court cited Texas’s lack of legal standing to challenge how another state manages its elections.<br />Some on the right claim that Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented, but this is wrong. The Justices said they would have taken the Texas case as a “bill of complaint” when states sue other states.<br />This is a technical point that concerns the Court’s case management, and the two Justices have a long-time view that the Court should hear more of these direct state appeals. We happen to agree, but in this case the Texas claim was outside constitutional bounds. Justice Alito (joined by Justice Thomas) added that he would “not grant other relief.” This was not a dissent on the merits of the Texas claim.<br />Mr. Trump and his camp are attacking the Court, and the President is deriding the “standing” point as a dodge. It is much more than that. Limits on standing are fundamental to a conservative understanding of the proper judicial role under Article III of the Constitution. If anyone can sue without a cognizable injury and the possibility of remedy, the courts would be overwhelmed with frivolous claims.</td>

      <td>Jenny Durkan isn’t running for re-election in November 2021, and the world doesn’t mourn. Seattle’s mayor says in a video that she had to choose between spending “the next year campaigning to keep this job” or focusing “all my energy on doing the job.” More likely, Ms. Durkan realized that if she ran, she’d probably lose.<br />The mayor will go down in history for allowing protesters to create a police-free Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) in her city. She famously went on CNN to herald the event as a “summer of love.” Occupiers took over a police precinct inside the zone but Ms. Durkan did nothing. Violence followed—and now continues, with Seattle already having 55 murders this year, nearly double the number for 2019.<br />It says something about Seattle’s progressives that their answer to rising crime has been to cut the police budget by 18%, which the mayor signed last week. They wanted to cut it by 50%, which helped push the city’s first African-American police chief, Carmen Best, to resign. Mayor Durkan fought the activists and drove the cuts down to 18%, which in Seattle makes her a moderate. At one point the CHAZ protestors marched to the mayor’s home to show their dissatisfaction.<br />With her announcement, the political landscape has opened up. But the progressive reality of Seattle means that the next mayor will more than likely be to her left. Get ready for more love and anarchy.</td>

      <td>Three Muslim men win at the Supreme Court under RFRA.</td>
      <td>Progressives often caricature the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as a special legal protection for intolerant Christians. But the Supreme Court delivered another refutation of that distortion last week, ruling unanimously that three Muslim men can sue federal agents under RFRA for alleged unfair treatment by the FBI.<br />The men say they were put on the no-fly list as retaliation after they refused to act as informants inside Muslim communities. Under RFRA, a federal law passed in 1993 and signed by President Clinton, if the government unlawfully burdens religious exercise, Americans may sue to “obtain appropriate relief.”<br />Although the Muslim men were eventually taken off the no-fly list, they also sued assorted federal agents for damages. The lead plaintiff, Muhammad Tanvir, told a lower court that he was forced to “quit his job as a truck driver, in part because he was unable to fly back to New York after completing long-distance, one-way deliveries.” The restriction also “prevented him from visiting his sick mother in Pakistan.”<br />But does RFRA even allow plaintiffs to sue government officials in their personal capacities like this, and for monetary damages? A district judge said no, dismissing the claims. But the Supreme Court now says yes in its 8-0 ruling in Tanzin v. Tanvir, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett not taking part. “A ‘government,’ under RFRA, extends beyond the term’s plain meaning to include officials,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the Court.<br />He added: “A damages remedy is not just ‘appropriate’ relief as viewed through the lens of suits against Government employees. It is also the only form of relief that can remedy some RFRA violations.” As an example, Justice Thomas cited the Muslim men’s “wasted plane tickets.”</td>

      <td>Sunday began disastrously for Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. The Miami Dolphins intercepted him. They sacked him for 30 yards on one play. Then they intercepted him again.<br />But the problem for the Dolphins was that football games don’t last one quarter. They have four quarters. And since Mahomes entered the NFL, nobody has really stopped him for four quarters.<br />Mahomes finished with 393 passing yards and two touchdowns. There was also a Tyreek Hill run for a touchdown, a Mecole Hardman punt return for a score and a safety by the defense. By the time the game was over, the Chiefs had turned a 10-0 deficit into a 30-10 lead that ended in a 33-27 win against a playoff-caliber team. Mahomes finished with more interceptions (three), than he had previously thrown all season (two), and they still won with ease.<br />It was a remarkable display of what has defined the Kansas City offense ever since Mahomes took over. Opponents can force incompletions, sack him and even intercept him. They can’t contain him for an entire game.<br />The swift turnaround was oddly familiar to anyone who remembered Mahomes’s last game in Miami. That was in a game called the Super Bowl—when Mahomes also rallied from 10 points down to win.</td>

      <td>A small-but-prominent roster of tech companies and investors are leaving the region</td>
      <td>For much of the past decade, the San Francisco Bay Area has strained to absorb the torrid growth of the tech sector. As head counts of highly paid engineers swelled, housing costs soared, traffic gridlock rose and homeless tents spread on city streets.<br />Now a small-but-prominent roster of tech companies and investors are doing something about it: leaving.<br />The region’s latest emigrant is database giant  Oracle Corp. , a fixture of Silicon Valley for decades that last year signed a 20-year deal to put its name on the San Francisco Giants’ stadium, Oracle Park. The $180 billion tech giant on Friday said it had changed its headquarters location to Austin from Redwood City, Calif.<br />Oracle provided few details, saying it is implementing more flexible remote-work policies but wouldn’t move staff. It follows an announcement earlier this month by  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. , another business-technology company with deep roots in Silicon Valley, that it is moving its headquarters to Houston—as well as similar moves by a number of well-known venture capitalists announced in recent months. Elon Musk, who had long lived in Los Angeles and commuted to  Tesla Inc.’s  operations near San Francisco, last week said he had moved to Texas. And he criticized the policies of the state as restrictive—echoing the arguments of many of those leaving the Bay Area.<br />These high-profile departures are causing some soul searching in Silicon Valley—taking some sheen off the area’s reputation as the unparalleled tech capital. While reasons vary, many moves appear to have been sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic that has reshaped notions of where and how we work, and companies, investors and employees are generally moving to places that are warmer, with lower taxes and cost of living.</td>

      <td>Screen-based meetings demand patience and new break-the-ice protocols, but you can wear gym shorts</td>
      <td>Jeanavic Malaiba had her routine for campus career fairs down cold. As she approached each recruiter, she would offer a firm handshake and pull a copy of her resume from an embossed leather portfolio she had saved up for, in order to appear more professional at interviews. Then she’d take a deep breath and launch into a tight pitch about the engineering classes she was taking at California State University, Long Beach and her hopes for a career in the aerospace industry.<br />But this fall, Ms. Malaiba began attending career fairs virtually and tweaked her strategy: She’d break the ice with recruiters joking about how both she and they were struggling with the event’s software, then quickly provide her full contact information in case they were disconnected.<br />Along with college classes, commencements and club meetings, the pandemic has pushed campus career fairs online this year. Instead of walking table to table, charming recruiters and elbowing classmates out of the way, job- and internship-hunting college students now log into virtual events where they may struggle to make an impression.<br />A poll of more than 500 schools conducted earlier this fall by the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that 85% had not conducted a virtual career fair in previous years but 80% planned one for this autumn. The same poll surveyed attendance in fairs that occurred earlier this season and found that 72% of the schools said fewer employers had participated compared with in-person events, while 81% of the schools reported fewer students as well.<br />Many students say they can wait hours to exchange chat messages with a recruiter, after dressing in business conservative on the chance the interaction might move to a videoconference. At a virtual career fair put on by her university, Ms. Malaiba says digital queues for some recruiters stretched on for four or five hours, longer than the fair itself. Students hoping to connect with specific employers had no option but to wait it out. “It was kind of confusing,” said Ms. Malaiba, who is 21. “In years past, you’d stand in line, you could see where you were in line, if you were next. We were kind of left in the dark, virtually.” Ms. Malaiba ultimately only spoke with one company. A representative of her school confirmed the career fair but declined to elaborate.</td>

Whether the network boss who oversaw those gains will stick around is an open question.<br />CNN averaged more total-day viewers than Fox News since Election Day through Dec. 8, a 35 day span, the first time it has won such a long stretch in that category in 19 years. CNN also bested the competition over that period among viewers ages 25 to 54, a demographic advertisers target on news channels. Fox News has retained the No. 1 spot in total prime-time ratings.<br />As CNN tries to maintain momentum, network parent WarnerMedia, a unit of  AT&T Inc.,  is in talks with CNN President Jeff Zucker on whether to renew his contract, with those discussions expected to heat up in coming weeks, people close to the situation say. Mr. Zucker had signaled to associates internally that he wasn’t sure whether he wanted to stay on, and would weigh his options after the election.<br />The contract negotiations are happening at the same time that CNN has become a target of takeover interest in the private-equity world. Recently, Mr. Zucker was made aware of investor interest in taking the network private, according to people familiar with the matter. One scenario floated was a management buyout that would see Mr. Zucker lead the network under new ownership, some of the people said. Mr. Zucker has indicated that would-be suitors should contact AT&T.<br />WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar said at a recent company town hall that CNN wasn’t for sale.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) last week proposed dropping the protections if Democrats agreed to forego state and local aid that has drawn Republican objections.<br />House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) indicated Sunday that Democrats may be open to a bill without state and local aid, which they have long insisted on in talks with Republicans.<br />“We need to act,” he said on CNN. “If acting means we’re not going to get everything we want, we think state and local is important, and if we can get that, we want to get it. But we want to get aid out to the people who are really, really struggling and are at great risk.”<br />Staff for Senate GOP leadership have started reviewing elements of the bipartisan group’s proposal that have support from both parties, according to a person familiar with the talks. The bipartisan proposal would add $300 a week to state unemployment benefits for four months, providing $300 billion in aid to small businesses, and sending $35 billion for health-care providers.</td>

      <td>Broadway went dark and theaters shuttered due to Covid-19; then creative companies nationwide started putting stunning shows online.</td>
      <td><br />The last time I went to a theater was in early March, when I reviewed the off-Broadway premiere of Katori Hall’s “The Hot Wing King.” Like everybody else in the civilized world, I was well aware of the Covid-19 pandemic, but it had never occurred to me that a week later all the theaters in New York would be locked up tight and I would be confined to my Manhattan apartment until further notice. No sooner was the lockdown order issued, though, than I realized that I’d need either to discontinue my weekly drama column or approach it in a radically different way.<br />Within a week, the solution had become clear to me. San Francisco’s American Conservatory Theater and Syracuse Stage, located in upstate New York, announced that they would be streaming broadcast-quality videos of stage productions that were already in previews at the time of the lockdown. Several other regional theater companies followed suit, and I thought—perhaps I should say hoped—that more such webcasts would soon fill the electronic pipeline. Sure enough, regional companies of all kinds started putting their shows online. At first I rarely had more than one or, at most, two webcasts to choose from in any given week, but by October the pipeline had become so full that I could be selective about what I reviewed.<br />Part of what makes this development so consequential is that while I’ve been reviewing regional theater throughout the U.S. since 2004, most of my readers previously had to take my word for it when I assured them that the best regional productions are as good as anything you can see in New York, not just in major cities like Chicago and Washington, but in the least likely places. I’ll never forget how staggered I was when I flew down to Florida in 2009 to see Palm Beach Dramaworks’ production of Eugène Ionesco’s “The Chairs,” an avant-garde parable of the absurdity of human life that hasn’t been revived in Manhattan since 1998. Palm Beach is, of course, a resort town dedicated to the pursuit of expensive pleasure, and I was understandably skeptical when I arrived at the theater, a converted storefront with some 80-odd seats. To my amazement, what I saw there was, as I later wrote in the Journal, “a close-to-ideal piece of work, vibrantly staged…and acted with colossal gusto.”<br />The catch was that you couldn’t confirm the accuracy of my review unless you lived in or took a vacation fairly close to West Palm Beach, where the company is headquartered. In those days, theatrical webcasts were all but unheard of—Actors’ Equity, the union that represents professional actors in the U.S., has long frowned on them, though it’s loosened the reins slightly in recent months—and I have a sneaking suspicion that it wasn’t until I took one of my editors at the Journal to see a spectacularly fine production of “Macbeth” in Red Bank, N.J., that he finally decided I wasn’t exaggerating when I wrote in 2006 that “the time has come for American playgoers—and, no less important, arts editors—to start treating regional theater not as a minor-league branch of Broadway but as an artistically significant entity in and of itself.” Now, thanks to webcasting, anyone with a laptop can watch the shows I review each week and see for themselves.</td>

      <td>Proposals would focus on smaller firms that can show they have been hurt by economic downturn</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Lawmakers considering a fresh round of financial aid for small businesses are focusing on firms with fewer employees that could show they have been hurt by the pandemic-triggered downturn, addressing criticisms that dogged the Paycheck Protection Program.<br />“Let us target the program to the smaller of the small businesses. Let’s make sure it’s based upon need, so that we get to the small businesses that really need help,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.), the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, during a Congressional hearing last week.<br />A bipartisan proposal for a broader, $908 billion coronavirus-aid bill includes $300 billion for the Small Business Administration and a restart of the PPP, which closed in August. The plan would limit loans to businesses that have 300 or fewer employees and can demonstrate that they sustained a 30% revenue loss in any quarter of 2020.<br />Such requirements would mark a departure from the program’s first iteration, which was launched in April and provided $525 billion in forgivable loans for firms to cover payroll and some overhead costs.<br />That PPP was designed to get money out quickly as the pandemic shut down swaths of the economy. It was generally open to businesses with up to 500 employees, and applicants only had to attest that economic uncertainty made the funds necessary to support operations.</td>

Another startup, financial tech company Affirm Holdings Inc., also delayed its planned IPO over the weekend, although the exact reasons weren’t clear.<br />Valuations of recent IPOs are at their highest levels since the dot-com bubble, relative to the companies’ revenue, sparking concerns among investors about the level of froth.<br />The result has been that the market capitalizations of many money-losing upstarts have become larger than giant, highly profitable stalwarts of corporate America.</td>

      <td>With galleries and museums closed due to Covid-19, online offerings blossomed—giving viewers the chance to experience outstanding exhibitions and masterpieces in a new, digital way.</td>
      <td><br />The last “normal” art-world event I attended, on March 12, was the opening of Kyle Staver’s exhibition at Zurcher Gallery, in downtown New York. The usual crowd gathered to savor Ms. Staver’s idiosyncratic updates on history painting—a waterborne Ophelia; Susanna in a hammock, flanked by tigers; the enigmatic Venus and the Octopus—and admire her exuberant conceptions, sinuous figures, and brooding color. The only sign of anything out of the ordinary was the absence of embraces. Just as at the art fairs the previous week, elbow bumps replaced air kisses. The next day, everything began to change. Isolation was recommended. Galleries and museums closed. Studio visits ended. Scheduled exhibitions were indefinitely postponed. Since it seemed irresponsible to write about art seen only virtually, my world altered abruptly.<br />Museums, galleries and artists adapted quickly to the new situation, expanding and intensifying their existing online activities, rapidly improving what was already there and how it could be used. For those of us who regularly attend shows and for those of us who teach, this meant increased time spent at our computers, seeking possibilities and sometimes making rewarding discoveries. Inaccessible exhibitions were soon viewable virtually, some more effectively than others. It took a while to get used to navigating simulated walks through galleries, which I usually found disorienting. I struggled with the tour of “True to Nature: Open-Air Painting in Europe, 1780-1870,” a marvelous assembly of intimate studies of landscape, sea and sky at the National Gallery, Washington, a show I’d seen just before lockdown, but I was delighted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art site’s handling of the illuminating survey of African culture “Sahel: Art and Empire on the Shores of the Sahara,” another show I’d seen. The Met allowed us to study works individually, as well as in installation views with no dizzying swoops, supported by informative texts.<br />Over time, I discovered many useful sites, while virtual offerings became better and more imaginative. The Morgan Library & Museum has long had a wealth of excellent materials online—links that permit closer study of medieval manuscript illuminations and Indian miniatures than would be possible in actuality or that simulate turning the pages of sketchbooks—but these seemed to proliferate. Why had I never pored over those virtual Cézanne or Ruskin sketchbooks before? The Frick Collection added engaging programs—most notably the immensely popular “Cocktails With a Curator”—to a virtual tour of the museum, plus links to videos of lectures and panels, reaching an enormous audience. “Cocktails” continues. Every Friday afternoon, chief curator Xavier Salomon or his colleague Aimee Ng discusses something from the collection—Rembrandt’s “ The Polish Rider,” the Fragonard room, Constable’s “The White Horse”—accompanied by a recipe for an appropriate beverage (plus a nonalcoholic version for the underage and teetotalers). “Travels With a Curator,” with the same guides, explores places with connections to the collection.<br />Many artists had maintained websites and regularly posted images and comments on Instagram since its inception; now with studio visits on hold and planned exhibitions canceled or indefinitely postponed thanks to Covid-19, an online presence became essential. I’ve resisted social media as time-consuming and invasive, but I was forced to join Instagram in order to keep up with artists who interest me. Instagram “exhibitions” now substitute for canceled shows, for example, or present videos and performances. The painter and sculptor John Bjerklie, aka BigHat, has made long-distance transmission of images integral to his work. (Mr. Bjerklie, early on, was a plein-air landscape painter who needed to shade his eyes outdoors, hence “BigHat.”) BigHat schedules simultaneous, live portrait-painting sessions with artist friends and colleagues internationally, via FaceTime or Skype. The astonishingly varied results are documented, with a nod to the role of technology—images on screens are often depicted in the backgrounds—and “exhibited” on BigHat’s Instagram page.</td>

In years past, they could look forward to boxes of chocolates, bottles of wine or foil-wrapped fruits. In 2019, Mr. Dunbar’s firm sent out packages from Omaha Steaks.<br />But Mr. Dunbar informed his customer base that this year he’s putting the holiday gift budget to a different use—by donating to two local food banks. “Everybody we’ve spoken with has said they’re so happy we’re doing this,” says Mr. Dunbar, president and CEO of Common Cents Planning in Glen Mills, Pa. “So many people out there are hurting, and this just felt right.”<br />At the end of an unfathomably difficult year, companies are rethinking the holiday gift ritual. For the many Americans personally affected by the coronavirus pandemic, the usual gifts might feel thoughtless. Others working from home can’t accommodate the branded goblets and trays of cake pops that so often wash ashore at the end of the year.<br />So bombarding clients and A-list contacts with treats has given way to a new form of reminding the people whose business matters most that they’re still front of mind. With holiday-party budgets freed up, and a year lived at a distance driving the urge to reconnect, the gifts aren’t going away. They’re just requiring more thought and care.<br />“It would feel uncomfortable to be lavish now,” says Diane Gottsman, an etiquette expert and founder of the Protocol School of Texas, in San Antonio. “Our mind-set during this pandemic is different, and what we want is to be cozy and comfortable, not to be inundated with bling and whistles.”</td>

      <td>Dozens of religious extremists burst into a Pentecostal church outside New Delhi in June, claiming it was built atop a Hindu temple. The group installed a Hindu idol in protest, and a pastor says he was punched in the head by attackers.<br />Members of a Hindu nationalist organization known as Bajrang Dal claimed responsibility in a video describing the incursion that has been viewed almost 250,000 times on Facebook. The social-media company’s safety team earlier this year concluded that Bajrang Dal supported violence against minorities across India and likely qualified as a “dangerous organization” that should be banned from the platform, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Facebook Inc.  balked at removing the group following warnings in a report from its security team that cracking down on Bajrang Dal might endanger both the company’s business prospects and its staff in India, the people said. Besides risking infuriating India’s ruling Hindu nationalist politicians, banning Bajrang Dal might precipitate physical attacks against Facebook personnel or facilities, the report warned.<br />Such conflicting concerns underscore the struggle Facebook faces in policing hate speech that exists in the vast sea of content posted to its platform around the world. The calculus is especially complicated in India, Facebook’s largest market by users. Facebook has staff on the ground, recently invested $5.7 billion in a new retail venture and interacts with a government whose politicians have ties to Hindu nationalist groups.<br />“We enforce our Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy globally without regard to political position or party affiliation,” said Facebook spokesman Andy Stone, calling the company’s process for determining what entities to ban careful, rigorous and multidisciplinary.</td>

Covid-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths are hitting records. States and localities are imposing new restrictions on dining and other activities. Claims for unemployment benefits are rising, and the jobless rate fell in November for the wrong reasons—more workers stopped seeking jobs.<br />But last week’s emergency authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of a coronavirus vaccine developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ,  plus a second candidate from  Moderna Inc.  also under review, is a potential economic game-changer because it could reduce uncertainty for households, businesses and policy makers.<br />“There is a bridge to somewhere now. You’re no longer just putting fingers in a dike that’s about to burst,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at accounting firm Grant Thornton. “We still have a lot of wounds to dress. But now you can see an end date, and it’s likely to happen in 2021.”<br />Fed officials face an economic outlook with little precedent. Economic growth is at risk of slowing further in the next few months and then revving up. How to navigate these developments will be the focus of the central bankers’ two-day meeting that concludes Wednesday.</td>

Ensuing losses hammered shares of his investment firm,  Ashmore Group ,  and cost the reclusive trader around $325 million in personal paper losses, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.<br />Once an approximately $100 billion powerhouse, Ashmore’s assets under management had fallen to $85.5 billion by September through a combination of withdrawals and investment losses. Clients including the Connecticut state retirement plan have pulled billions of dollars from the company, and competing money managers have placed bets against Ashmore stock. The outflows contrast with the roughly $250 billion investors poured into bond mutual funds this year through September, according to data from the Investment Company Institute.<br />The losing streak has drawn unwanted attention to Mr. Coombs, who strives to avoid the limelight. “He’s not your typical billionaire jetting around and buying megayachts,” one former colleague said. “He hates having pictures taken of him and is incredibly, fiercely private.”<br />Mr. Coombs built Ashmore over the past two decades with a signature mix of radical frugality—from his wardrobe to staff salaries—and contrarian trades in risky countries. He has weathered previous rough patches and is responding to the current one in similar fashion—by buying more bonds.</td>

The CDC ordered the halt on evictions under the Public Health Service Act, which allows the federal government to enact regulations that help stop the spread of infectious diseases.<br />Between 2.4 million and 5 million American households are at risk of eviction in January alone, and millions more will be vulnerable in the months after, according to estimates from the investment bank and financial-advisory firm Stout Risius Ross.<br />While several states and cities have their own eviction bans with varying rules and expiration dates, the CDC order is the only one that covers the entire country.<br />Many housing-industry executives expect the CDC eviction ban to be extended. The ramifications would be catastrophic otherwise, and even many landlords believe they are more likely to recover some rent by working with tenants, rather than by evicting them.</td>

      <td>Russell 2000 bounces back from a spring nosedive to log a 15% gain so far this year, surpassing the S&P 500</td>
      <td>Shares of small U.S. companies have surged past their larger peers for 2020 after last month’s furious rally carried into December.<br />Fueled by improving expectations for the economy, thanks to promising Covid-19 vaccine trials, the Russell 2000 small-cap index notched its best-ever month in November. Then it kept rising. So far in December it has advanced 5%, well ahead of the 1.2% rise in the S&P 500 large-cap benchmark. Many investors expect small-cap stocks to continue leading the way.<br />Among the stocks lifting the small-cap index:  Macy’s Inc.,  up 8.5% in December;  Spirit Airlines Inc.,  up 16%;  Denny’s Corp. , up 20%; and, U.S. Steel Corp., up 29%.<br />The Russell 2000’s gain for the year surpassed that of the S&P 500 on Tuesday for the first time in 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The small-cap gauge is now up 15% this year, compared with a 13% gain for the large-cap index. If the Russell 2000 maintains its edge, it would outperform the S&P 500 for the first time since 2016, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Both indexes still trail the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite, which is up 38%.<br />The Russell 2000’s comeback is a dramatic turnaround from earlier in the year. The index plummeted 42% from its January high to its March low—a deeper plunge than that of the S&P 500—as the coronavirus hampered activity and reshaped economic expectations. Small-caps spent the following months recovering much of that loss, but only in recent weeks made their dramatic run.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Large crowds of Trump supporters gathered in Washington, D.C., on Saturday calling for the November presidential-election result to be overturned, two days before the Electoral College meets.<br />By evening, skirmishes broke out between some of the demonstrators and counterprotesters.<br />The pro-Trump demonstration near the White House brought together a variety of backers of President Trump during the day, including some members of far-right groups such as the Proud Boys. The gathering was a reprise of a similar rally after last month’s election, which also led to violence overnight.<br />The protests came after the Supreme Court rejected Texas’s long-shot bid to void 20 million votes in four other states. It was Mr. Trump’s last chance to overturn the election results before the Electoral College convenes Monday to formally cast the votes that determine the president. Joe Biden has earned 306 votes to Mr. Trump’s 232.<br />Attorney General William Barr has said the Justice Department hasn’t found evidence of widespread voter fraud. A federal court in Wisconsin also dealt another blow to the president on Saturday, dismissing one of his few remaining lawsuits, which had argued the state’s election results should be thrown out.</td>

      <td>The Iowa Democratic Party released a report Saturday that said late technology demands from the Democratic National Committee contributed to a caucus results-reporting debacle that marred the start of the presidential nomination process.<br />Technical glitches and tabulation problems from Iowa’s Feb. 3 Democratic caucuses meant results were delayed for days and confusion dominated the formal start of the nomination race. An app the state party developed to allow volunteers from roughly 1,700 neighborhood caucus sites to report vote totals crashed, and there were problems with a backup-telephone system.<br />The drama prompted some Democrats to call for an end to Iowa’s first-in-the-nation status, which the state has protected even as others have moved their nominating contests earlier. The caucuses generate millions of dollars of revenue and massive political attention.<br />The document said that the DNC demanded late changes to the reporting system Iowa Democrats planned to use and that those alterations resulted in failure. “Attempting to graft an entirely new software element onto the back-end reporting system at the proverbial eleventh hour is likely always going to be problematic, and it was ultimately the cause of a major problem on caucus night,” the report said.<br />The report also blamed the Iowa Democratic Party for not being better prepared. “The IDP—not the DNC—is ultimately responsible to ensure that its caucus tools and infrastructure are in place prior to the caucuses,” it said.</td>

      <td>The drug giant’s bid for rare-disease specialist Alexion should please shareholders if the company doesn’t find itself in a bidding war</td>
      <td>AstraZeneca ’s  $39 billion splurge to acquire Alexion Pharmaceuticals  looks like a winner—as long as it can hang on at that price tag.<br />The European pharmaceuticals giant said Saturday it would acquire the rare-disease specialist for $175 a share, with just over one-third of that payable in cash and the remainder in stock. AstraZeneca is paying a 45% premium to Alexion’s Friday closing price.<br />The deal has obvious benefits for both sides. AstraZeneca’s big prize in this deal is the blood disorder treatment Soliris, which generates roughly $5 billion in annual sales. That would rank right alongside the cancer drug Tagrisso as one of the company’s bestselling products. Competition for Soliris is unlikely to reach the market for several years, and rare-disease patients have historically been reluctant to switch treatments, even if a drug with superior data reaches the market.<br />Much of the public attention that AstraZeneca has received recently has surrounded its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, but it is unlikely to be a significant part of company sales for a long time. Alexion is far more material. AstraZeneca expects the deal to increase earnings per share by at least 10% over the next three years. The company also said that the acquisition “supports” its “progressive dividend policy,” signaling a higher payout eventually.<br />As for Alexion, its stock price is down 40% since its 2015 high, despite those huge cash flows. Drug companies with one product accounting for the majority of their sales tend to trade at low earnings multiples. In the case of Alexion, Soliris accounts for more than 80% of 2020 estimated revenue. Its shares fetch just 10 times this year’s adjusted profit forecast. By that logic, an asset like Soliris is more valuable to a larger, more-diversified company like AstraZeneca, in the eyes of Wall Street.</td>

      <td>Our unique ability to analyze patterns is at the root of a psychological disability and the talent that drives human development</td>
      <td>On the face of it, we shouldn’t expect any link between a neurological disability and one of the crowning talents of our species. But new research is revealing a surprising connection between autism and the uniquely human capacity for invention.<br />As the archaeological record shows, our ancestors started inventing things 70,000 to 100,000 years ago. This was when humans evolved the capacity to seek patterns—particularly to spot and experiment with the basic cause-and-effect relationship of if-and-then. With the development of this ability came the earliest examples of jewelry making (75,000 years ago) and the first bow-and-arrow (71,000 years ago). By around 44,000 years ago, we find the first evidence of counting.<br />The idea that if-and-then systemizing lies at the root of such technological invention derives from the work of George Boole, a 19th-century English logician. To get a simple idea of how it works, consider the earliest musical instrument, a flute made from the hollow bone of a bird, found in a cave in Germany and dated to about 40,000 years ago. Its maker must have thought: If I blow down this hollow bone, and I cover one hole, then I make sound A. That would be repeated with variations: If I blow down this hollow bone, and I uncover one hole, then I make sound B.<br />Proceeding this way can create something new—an invention. If we think that the new device is better than a previous one, we retain it. This same exquisite if-and-then logic underlies the engineering of any complex tool or system, from agriculture and cooking to math, medicine and music.<br />It happens that inventors and autistic people both love to repeat their observations of such patterns, over and over again, to uncover timeless laws. At Cambridge University’s Autism Research Centre, which I direct, we set out to explore this convergence. Our research found an overlap between the minds of those gifted in invention and the minds of autistic people. Both are more likely to be pattern seekers, or hyper-systemizers, strongly driven to analyze or build systems by identifying and experimenting with if-and-then patterns.</td>

      <td>Shut in at home, many of us had more time than ever to watch great TV—and there was more than enough of it, from ‘I May Destroy You’ to ‘The Queen’s Gambit.’</td>
      <td>The first show I reviewed in 2020 was the Netflix miniseries “Dracula,” which now seems like a foreshadowing too obvious even for a 19th-century potboiler. As in any adaptation of the 1897 Bram Stoker novel, vampirism was a kind of contagion; intimacy could be lethal; evil was poised to go viral; death lay in the story’s DNA. It’s probably fortunate, for both the series and the critic, that this “Dracula” preceded the explosions of the pandemic, because Covid-19 would have been perceived as lurking around every Transylvanian corner.<br />Almost everything on the small screen this year was made well before the disease was public and raging, and yet coronavirus intruded on the consciousness nonetheless. How could it not? One of the best shows of the year, the eight-part documentary epic “Lenox Hill,” portrayed the medical maelstrom inside the New York hospital of the title—before the virus hit. All one could think was “What kind of hell is it now?” (Wisely, a ninth episode, called “Pandemic,” was added by Netflix a little later.) “Transplant,” the NBC series imported from Canada, was also hospital-themed and inadvertently raised all kinds of issues in the mind of the viewer—among them, “Where’s your mask?” But even during the buoyant comedy series “Never Have I Ever,” I was thinking: Oh yeah, remember when teenagers crowded into high-school corridors and worried about crushes, first kisses, what clothes they wore and who was cool? And, BTW, when they actually went to school?<br />Divorcing oneself from current events wasn’t really possible. There just seemed to be more current events this year. And more television. Lots more. Even with a lockdown to help you out, there was no way to watch it all, or even to get one’s head around what was happening here and there among the multifarious platforms and services, from video-on-demand to the oh-so-quaint world of network television. Or with an outfit like Netflix, just for instance, delivering half-a-dozen new shows a week.<br />Presumably—and it seems a safe presumption—people were watching more television: Self-preservation required more time at home, and there often wasn’t much of an entertainment choice, given that museums, concert halls, movie theaters and clubs were shuttered. The critic’s curatorial responsibility, in turn, seemed to grow, and grow a bit confusing: If readers were watching more, what were they watching more of? And why? Was it purely to escape? Were they catching up on series they’d missed? Were they just happy to binge their way through a health-crisis tunnel with no discernible light at the end?<br />In the limited number of social situations I found myself in this year, talk invariably gravitated to television, and not just because I monopolized the conversation. People were enthusiastic about things they’d been able to discover, or rediscover, during their time at home. Knowing this, my critical calculation was to try to steer readers in the direction of shows that they’d be kicking themselves later for having missed the first time around. Shows like “The Queen’s Gambit,” which is my personal favorite drama of the year, or other first-rate fictional series that made their debuts throughout 2020—“I May Destroy You,” “The Great,” “I Know This Much Is True,” “Normal People” and the gripping “Baghdad Central.” One of the upsides of our time is that most everything can be viewed at one’s leisure, through an array of providers.</td>

But Amazon fell to No. 4 this year as  Apple Inc.  took the No. 2 spot, followed by  International Business Machines Corp.  Google parent  Alphabet Inc.  rounds out the tech-centric top five.

      <td>What do you call an investment strategy that would have left the likes of  Amazon ,   Facebook ,   Tesla ,   Netflix  and Google parent  Alphabet  out of your portfolio?<br />Aside from some unprintable words, “stodgy” might come to mind. But until recently, a portfolio that mechanically excluded such nonpayers of dividends would have done very well. They might again in practice, even if they shouldn’t in theory.<br />Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller, pioneers of modern financial theory, argued decades ago that investors should in theory be largely indifferent to dividends. Since the 1980s, the payouts have become quaint in the U.S. as companies have been able to freely buy back their shares. In the second quarter of this year, the yield from buybacks in the S&P 500 was 2.52% whereas the dividend yield was just 1.75%, according to Yardeni Research.<br />The decision to pay out cash comes down to how much money investors think management can earn if they keep it. Activist investors have split on the issue recently with D.E. Shaw pushing  Exxon Mobil  to cut expenditures to maintain its fat dividend and Third Point asking Walt  Disney  to suspend its payout and invest in streaming instead.<br />Yet for something that theoretically shouldn’t matter, dividend-paying stocks have done swimmingly. The key seems to be focusing on those with high but sustainable payouts. Slicing large U.S. companies into quintiles by dividend yield found that the second-highest-yielding group beat the market most consistently each year over many decades. Measured from 1928 through 2019, a basket of dividend payers in that quintile saw a $1 investment turn into $25,395, according to Dartmouth College professor Kenneth French. A basket of nonpayers would have been worth just $2,139.</td>

This was one of the first flights to make the trip.<br />Passengers were told they would either have to pay for a return flight to South Australia or commit to a 14-day quarantine on arrival in the city of Perth.<br />Health officials and lawmakers in Australia say they are convinced that the country’s success in suppressing the coronavirus owes much to a series of border controls that are among the strictest in the Western world, although it has come at a cost to businesses.<br />Now, as Australia and other governments prepare to roll out vaccines and reopen their economies, deciding when to let people travel freely is proving difficult.</td>

The vaccine is being reviewed by U.K. and European medicines regulators, and could be authorized for emergency use in the U.K. within weeks, scientists involved in it have said.<br />The company has embarked on one of the most ambitious efforts to manufacture and distribute the vaccine among a handful of Western pharmaceutical giants, assuming it gets the green light for its shot. With the Alexion deal, it is now also pursuing one of the biggest drug industry deals of the year.<br />AstraZeneca said Alexion will give it a greater scientific presence in immunology, with a rare-disease unit based in Boston. Directors of both companies have approved the acquisition, which they expect to close in the third quarter of 2021.<br />AstraZeneca has reinvented itself in recent years as a cancer-drug powerhouse. It had suffered years of shrinking revenue as blockbusters in its portfolio were hit by generic competition when patents expired.</td>

      <td>The indefatigable mogul describes her approach to beauty, wellness, social media and aging. She’s a fan of CBD products and ring lights.</td>
      <td>IN NEARLY 30 years of appearing on television and lending her name and expertise to 97 books, a magazine, Christmas trees, crafting supplies, dog beds and CBD gummies, Martha Stewart, 79, has always been the face of her ventures. But during our collective quarantine, her already significant use of social media as a personal branding tool grew. Her long-standing interest in wellness, skincare and beauty became newly relevant as she connected with millions of followers, many of them a fraction of her age. She invested in more sophisticated lighting for her Zoom calls; she lost some weight; she posted a viral selfie at the edge of her East Hampton swimming pool (after learning the term, she admitted that the alluring picture was a “thirst trap,” or purposefully enticing post). For a woman approaching her ninth decade, when CEOs of all genders typically shrink back, she is placing her own image front and center.<br />“When you are the face of the brand there are a lot of obligations to look good at all times,” said Ms. Stewart when we spoke last week.<br />That’s especially true in the Instagram era, with its nonstop narrative potential—and scrutiny. “A picture [on social media] tells a big story and generally those pictures can be zoomed in on, so people are zooming in on the tiniest details,” said Ms. Stewart. “They’re zooming in on your pores of your face, and they’re zooming in on your teeth and your ears and your hair, and it’s never been like that before. Once there was a picture in a magazine and you looked great, and they couldn’t zoom in on anything.”<br />With her fans zooming in on her photos and livestreams as well as watching her on multiple high-definition TV shows, (“Martha Knows Best,” “Chopped” and “Clipped,” an upcoming topiary series) her regime is more important than ever. In addition to a conscientious skincare routine which typically begins with a 4 a.m. face mask, she says she’s been eating healthily and spending time horseback riding during quarantine. Facials, haircuts and color and manicures have all resumed cautiously after a long pandemic break. Every morning she drinks a green juice made in her Breville juicer (ingredients: celery, parsley leaves, spinach, cucumbers, ginger, pineapple, the skin and the pulp of a half of an orange or a grapefruit, and sometimes persimmon, mint, carrot or pear).<br />On most mornings when she is shooting, her makeup artist Nicole Daisy Toye, 39, will drive the hour-plus out to Westchester from New York City to do her makeup. Ms. Toye has been doing Ms. Stewart’s makeup for 10 years, and they’ve traveled extensively together (her mother wrote the mogul a letter thanking her for showing her daughter the world). Now that Ms. Stewart has shared her limelight with Ms. Toye on social media, the makeup artist is bombarded with questions from women about how to get the Martha look. Ms. Toye repeats the basics constantly: take care of your skin, wear sunscreen, invest in a good foundation, a bronzer and a blush. If there’s a secret sauce, it’s getting serious about lighting: Ms. Toye and Ms. Stewart buy their ring lights and Light & Motion LED lights from professional photo equipment store B&H.</td>

      <td>New York<br />Visitors to “Working Together: The Photographers of the Kamoinge Workshop” at the Whitney Museum of American Art are likely to have two immediate reactions.<br />The first will be to wonder why this group of African-American photographers is not better known. What took so long for major museums to take note of their contributions?<br />A second reaction should then override the first. Walking through the galleries on the eighth floor, which feature some 140 black-and-white photographs and relevant ephemera by 14 artists, people may begin to forget that most of the names are unfamiliar and instead bask in the sheer luminosity of the prints. This was a group of men (and one woman) that cared deeply about exploring the nuances and depths possible with monochrome film and paper. (If you can’t see the show in person, the Whitney has a digital feature on its website where visitors can see nearly all of the photos in the show and learn more about each artist.)<br />“Kamoinge” is a word borrowed from the Kikuyu language of Kenya and translates as “a group of people acting and working together.” The photographer and teacher Louis Draper (1935-2002) chose the name in 1963 when he founded the collective in New York. He had studied with the leading photojournalist of the day, W. Eugene Smith, and wanted to portray Black communities with the same emotional scope found in the work of Smith, Gordon Parks and Roy DeCarava brought to their subjects.</td>

Both companies said the mouthwashes dissolve the outer protective layer of virus particles, preventing them from attaching to cells and infecting them.<br />But based on tests so far they can’t definitively say how long the benefit would last or what impact coughing would have. That makes it hard to judge how useful oral-hygiene products could be in curbing transmission.</td>

The upgrade, which the company calls interactive teaching, could represent a significant advance in the way AI-powered voice assistants interpret and learn from everyday conversation, experts say.<br />Interactive teaching is powered by deep-learning models, and it works by having Alexa ask questions about a task-relevant phrase it is encountering for the first time.<br />For instance, if a user asks Alexa to set the lights to “reading mode” and the device hasn’t heard that phrase before, it will ask what it means. If the user says it means to set the lights at 50% brightness, Alexa will remember that for the next time.<br />Before this, teaching Alexa new terms required manual steps, such as having engineers program updates, or having users type in verbal triggers for actions in the Alexa app.<br />But with the new capability, Alexa is able to recognize gaps in its understanding and initiate the learning process, said Rohit Prasad, vice president and head scientist for Alexa AI at Amazon. The upgrade is available  in all U.S. Alexa devices.</td>

Their shutdowns are hitting minorities the hardest and increasing economic inequality.<br />Democratic governors in Michigan, Illinois, Oregon and Washington in recent weeks have closed indoor dining. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has banned outdoor patios in most areas too. Mr. Cuomo said Friday that he’s shutting down indoor dining in New York City as of Monday.<br />According to state contact tracing data, restaurants and bars account for 1.4% of the virus spread in the state while household gatherings make up nearly 74%. That’s not surprising. In New York City, restaurants were limited to 25% capacity. Who limits capacity in their living rooms during football watch parties or Thanksgiving?<br />Restaurants and other small businesses have spent heavily to comply with government Covid regulations, including buying personal protective equipment for staff and improved ventilation systems. But now they are being punished because, well, government can’t control the virus and Democratic leaders feel they must appear to be doing something.<br />Democratic governors probably expect Congress to pass a Covid relief bill with more aid for small businesses. But this won’t cover all their rent, utilities and other overhead. The National Restaurant Association this week said 110,000 restaurants have permanently shuttered in 2020, notwithstanding forgivable government loans.</td>

      <td>China continues to arrest and punish Hong Kong’s brave freedom fighters, and it’s important that the world not forget them. The Trump Administration is speaking up, and let’s hope the Biden crowd does too.<br />Hong Kong police said Friday that Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy publisher who has written for these pages, has been charged under a new national security law. Police said Mr. Lai had colluded with foreign forces without providing any details. His real offense is that he has criticized the Beijing government and endorsed foreign sanctions for its assault on the autonomy China promised Hong Kong in its treaty with the U.K.<br />Any dissent now is a crime in the city. The national security law allows a defendant to be tried in secret or transported to Chinese courts and jail. The political pressure from Beijing will be enormous on Hong Kong’s courts, which are supposed to be independent, to convict Mr. Lai. A bail hearing was scheduled for Saturday for Mr. Lai, who is 72 years old.<br />Meanwhile, the Journal reports that Hong Kong democratic activist Sixtus Leung is seeking asylum in the U.S. Mr. Leung, who is 34, was elected to the city’s legislature in 2016 but was disqualified after a ruling from Beijing. He has advocated self-determination for Hong Kong, which would also put him on Beijing’s target list for violating the national security law.<br />Bloomberg News reports that Chinese security officials have also detained Haze Fan, a Chinese staffer in Beijing, without explanation. Most foreign publications operating in China employ expatriates and Chinese nationals. Chinese citizens are especially vulnerable, and the arrest could be intended to intimidate other Chinese to stop working for Western publications.</td>

      <td>An Obama-era solar failure could cost taxpayers $510 million.</td>
      <td>Move over, Solyndra. Another green boondoggle from the Obama era has failed, and taxpayers are out as much as $510 million. Late last week Judge Karen Owens approved a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization by Tonopah Solar Energy. Tonopah operated the Crescent Dunes solar plant in Nevada that received $737 million in guaranteed loans from the Obama Administration.<br />The plan includes a settlement with the Department of Energy that leaves taxpayers liable for as much as $234.68 million in outstanding debt, but the total public cost is even higher. Crescent Dunes also received an investment-tax credit, and the 2009 stimulus legislation allowed it to receive a cash payment in lieu of credit. In 2017 the plant received more than $275.6 million from Treasury under the Section 1603 program, which it used to service its outstanding liabilities. So taxpayers already gave Crescent Dunes cash to pay off its taxpayer-backed loans.<br />This is one more cautionary tale in climate subsidies. The sun doesn’t deliver power when it’s cloudy or dark. Crescent Dunes promised to solve this problem by using molten salt to retain the heat from the sun and produce steam, so the plant would generate power 24/7.<br />But Crescent Dunes struggled to get financing from commercial lenders—not least because it was “the first of its kind in the United States and the tallest molten salt tower in the world,” as the Department of Energy gushed in a September 2011 news release.<br />Uncle Sam still rushed in, and the problems soon began. Because of construction delays, Crescent Dunes missed its deadline to begin commercial operations. Equipment failures meant the plant generated no energy through the first half of 2017. Outages were so frequent that the sole buyer of its power, the utility NV Energy, told regulators that Crescent Dunes posed “the most significant risk” to its ability to meet its renewable portfolio goals.</td>

      <td>An new state effort to overturn a law banning race preferences.</td>
      <td>No matter how many times voters reject racial preferences in law, the advocates won’t stop trying to fool the public with another tricky rewrite. The latest example comes from Washington state, where voters defeated an effort to overturn a ban on race preferences in 2019. Now there’s a new initiative, I-1300, which may be the most deceptive.<br />The disguise begins with its name, the Manuel Ellis Washington Anti-Discrimination Act. Ellis was a black man who died in March while being arrested by Tacoma police in what the Pierce County medical examiner says was a homicide. I-1300 would ban police chokeholds and other uses of force it considers excessive.<br />If that’s all it did, the use of Ellis’s name would be understandable. But the initiative also rewrites state law to overturn the state’s ban on race preferences for public contracting, public employment and admissions to public colleges. It buries this in 22 pages whose topics range from breastfeeding in public and free Covid-19 vaccinations to Donald Trump’s refusal “to denounce white supremacists during the first nationally televised presidential debate with former vice president Joe Biden.”<br />The operative language doesn’t come until Part VII, 16 pages in, where it redefines “preferential treatment.” Current law says the “state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, or national origin.” The new language forbids preferential treatment only when it is solely based on these categories.<br />The addition of “solely” is a giant loophole because it sets no real limits. It is the same loophole Harvard and other schools cite to justify their own discrimination in admissions, arguing that race is merely one of many considerations.</td>

Excitement revved up over the summer and fizzled, only to start again last month when S&P initially unveiled its plan to add the electric-car maker to the index. The final piece of the puzzle was which stock would be removed.<br />Tesla shares have skyrocketed this year, up more than 600%, with much of those gains coming in the past month. Individual investors and fund managers who actively buy stocks pounced on the news that the stock would join the index, anticipating a surge in demand that would push Tesla shares even higher. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts initially said such activity would push Tesla shares up to $600 by the inclusion date. But shares have already blown past that estimate, closing Friday at nearly $610.<br />Changes to the index are usually a mundane affair. But in the case of Tesla, the switch isn’t as simple as buying one stock and selling another for the fund managers who track the index.</td>

      <td>Movie-industry types are aghast at AT&T’s galumphing moves but may soon see dollar signs.</td>
      <td>Hollywood is good at generating drama. Christopher Nolan is especially good at it. Mr. Nolan is the director behind three Batman blockbusters, “Inception,” “Dunkirk” and several other movies you’ve heard of. And yet he probably never thrilled any audience as much he did movie-industry insiders this week with his denunciation of Warner Bros. and its corporate parent,  AT&T .<br />Citing the pandemic, Warner announced that its full slate of 2021 releases would appear on its affiliated HBO Max streaming service on the same day as theaters. Warner did not say this would become routine. Much of Hollywood’s output in recent years has been destined for streaming rather than theatrical release. But such considerations did not hinder the colorful declarations of Mr. Nolan. Previously known for pledging that he would never do business with  Netflix ,  he was quoted everywhere saying the once-storied Warner Bros. studio had soiled its relation with talent and that its decision “makes no economic sense.”<br />Actually, it makes plenty of sense. Hollywood is a business. If theater owners could make it worth Warner’s while to debut its movies exclusively in theaters, Warner would happily do so.<br />In fact, much of the noise is routine posturing in advance of predictable negotiations. Many parties, including actors and directors, will need to be compensated for box-office shares they originally expected to receive from the movies playing on big screens. Still, the studio is not obliged to compensate them for sales lost to the pandemic, only for sales lost to HBO Max, which is found in less than a third of America’s homes and has little overseas distribution, where much of Hollywood’s ticket revenue nowadays is generated.<br />The end of the world this isn’t. Movie professionals might even start to appreciate a new term, “churn.” Instead of fussing over changes to the distribution model that were coming anyway, the Hollywood talent pool ought to see this as yet another pile of money to drive up fees, salaries and payouts to the talent pool.</td>

      <td>Jill Biden should think about dropping the honorific, which feels fraudulent, even comic.</td>
      <td>Madame First Lady—Mrs. Biden—Jill—kiddo: a bit of advice on what may seem like a small but I think is a not unimportant matter. Any chance you might drop the “Dr.” before your name? “Dr. Jill Biden” sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic. Your degree is, I believe, an Ed.D., a doctor of education, earned at the University of Delaware through a dissertation with the unpromising title “Student Retention at the Community College Level: Meeting Students’ Needs.” A wise man once said that no one should call himself “Dr.” unless he has delivered a child. Think about it, Dr. Jill, and forthwith drop the doc.<br />I taught at Northwestern University for 30 years without a doctorate or any advanced degree. I have only a B.A. in absentia from the University of Chicago—in absentia because I took my final examination on a pool table at Headquarters Company, Fort Hood, Texas, while serving in the peacetime Army in the late 1950s. I do have an honorary doctorate, though I have to report that the president of the school that awarded it was fired the year after I received it, not, I hope, for allowing my honorary doctorate. During my years as a university teacher I was sometimes addressed, usually on the phone, as “Dr. Epstein.” On such occasions it was all I could do not to reply, “Read two chapters of Henry James and get into bed. I’ll be right over.”<br />I was also often addressed as Dr. during the years I was editor of the American Scholar, the quarterly magazine of Phi Beta Kappa. Let me quickly insert that I am also not a member of Phi Beta Kappa, except by marriage. Many of those who so addressed me, I noted, were scientists. I also received a fair amount of correspondence from people who appended the initials Ph.D. to their names atop their letterheads, and have twice seen PHD on vanity license plates, which struck me as pathetic. In contemporary universities, in the social sciences and humanities, calling oneself Dr. is thought bush league.<br />The Ph.D. may once have held prestige, but that has been diminished by the erosion of seriousness and the relaxation of standards in university education generally, at any rate outside the sciences. Getting a doctorate was then an arduous proceeding: One had to pass examinations in two foreign languages, one of them Greek or Latin, defend one’s thesis, and take an oral examination on general knowledge in one’s field. At Columbia University of an earlier day, a secretary sat outside the room where these examinations were administered, a pitcher of water and a glass on her desk. The water and glass were there for the candidates who fainted. A far cry, this, from the few doctoral examinations I sat in on during my teaching days, where candidates and teachers addressed one another by first names and the general atmosphere more resembled a kaffeeklatsch. Dr. Jill, I note you acquired your Ed.D. as recently as 15 years ago at age 55, or long after the terror had departed.<br />The prestige of honorary doctorates has declined even further. Such degrees were once given exclusively to scholars, statesmen, artists and scientists. Then rich men entered the lists, usually in the hope that they would donate money to the schools that had granted them their honorary degrees. (My late friend Sol Linowitz, then chairman of Xerox, told me that he had 63 honorary doctorates.) Famous television journalists, who passed themselves off as intelligent, followed. Entertainers, who didn’t bother feigning intelligence, were next.</td>

Mr. Hoops has previously denied allegations that he used Blackjewel for his benefit, testifying in bankruptcy court last year that “my interest is always in the best interest of Blackjewel and never in my personal interest.”<br />Blackjewel’s investigation of Mr. Hoops is one of the open-issues remaining in the company’s bankruptcy, which attracted national attention and scrutiny from the U.S. Labor Department after laid-off workers in Cumberland, Ky., spent weeks blocking a shipment of coal in protest of not receiving their final paychecks. Ultimately, the business receiving the coal shipment agreed to pay more than $5 million to cover the workers’ back pay.</td>

      <td>Can a group portrait of modern tyrants tell us how to  prevent their outrages?</td>
      <td>In the very first sentence of “Strongmen,” its author, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, declares that her book “reflects a lifetime of thinking about authoritarian rulers.” This revelation of an extensive personal timeline of toil—a lifetime, no less—places a burden on Ms. Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University. Many readers—and not just the most exacting among them—are likely to say to themselves: “This book had better be good.”<br />Alas, misgivings surface at the outset, when Ms. Ben-Ghiat provides a list of her “protagonists.” They span from “Mussolini to the Present” (as the book’s subtitle states) and include, apart from Il Duce (about whom Ms. Ben-Ghiat has written elegantly in her previous books) such stalwarts of the strongman species as Hitler, Franco, Muammar Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein and Vladimir Putin. Many will take delight in the fact, which others will find irksome, that Donald Trump is also on her list, whose members number 17 in all. Of these, only three—Somalia’s onetime dictator Siad Barre, Gaddafi and Saddam—are not of the political right. And of those three, only Barre might be called a straightforward leftist. Gaddafi professed a “revolutionary” ideology never before known to man; and Saddam, an ostensibly pan-Arab Baathist, reposed greater faith in terror than in dogma.<br />So where—you might ask—are Xi Jinping, Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez? Or Lenin, Stalin and Mao? Where on earth are the Korean Kims? Certainly not in Ms. Ben-Ghiat’s book, except mentioned in passing. She offers a blithe but unconvincing explanation for the omission of the Communist ilk: “To illuminate the entire arc of authoritarian rule,” she writes, “starting with how democracies are degraded or destroyed, I do not include Communist leaders like Xi who take power in an already-closed system.” Try telling the Turkic Muslim Uighurs or the Tibetans that Mr. Xi is not a strongman because he is the product of an established process.<br />Even by Ms. Ben-Ghiat’s litmus test—that of an “already-closed system”—the exclusion of Castro and Chavez is baffling. Both men established communism and “Bolivarian” socialism from scratch in their respective countries. There was no such system before them in Cuba and Venezuela. They are unlike Mussolini or Franco, say, only in the specific credo they espouse.<br />If wobbly in its analytical structure, Ms. Ben-Ghiat’s book is rich in anecdote. Mobutu Sese Seko, the strongman of Zaire/Congo, kept as his mistress the twin sister of his own wife. Gaddafi had a “sex dungeon” at the University of Tripoli for “instant gratification” with female students brought to him (against their will) by aides. Augusto Pinochet frequently spent time with female journalists who, in the words of a former Chilean minister, “came to interview him, but never published anything.” One of Saddam’s sons raped the daughter of his father’s favorite mistress. Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi reportedly described Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, as an “unf—able lardass” in a phone conversation he was having as she stood within earshot. In another incident, which Ms. Ben-Ghiat regards as “misogynist,” Mr. Putin unleashed his dog near Ms. Merkel to trigger her well-known fear of canines.</td>

      <td>How the Prussian explorer, naturalist and polymath taught America about itself.</td>
      <td>The history seems barely credible. A Prussian aristocrat, born in 1769, works for five years as a mine inspector. After his mother’s death, he uses a good chunk of the family fortune on a five-year expedition through the primeval forests and uncharted waterways of South America and Mexico. On his way home, in 1804, he spends a scant six weeks in the United States. But by virtue of his American contacts, his German and French writing, his research and his generosity of spirit, Alexander von Humboldt inspires a century of American writers, artists, explorers and scientists, championing America’s exceptionalism while also assessing its flaws.<br />The American landscape painter Frederic Edwin Church, for example, embarked on an expedition that followed in Humboldt’s footsteps; he also hung Humboldt’s portrait in his home above the Hudson River. Ralph Waldo Emerson called Humboldt “one of those wonders of the world . . . who appear from time to time, as if to show us the possibilities of the human mind.” Emerson introduced Humboldt’s writings to Thoreau, who was haunted by them. The inventor (and painter) Samuel F.B. Morse, along with Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper, made pilgrimages to visit Humboldt. On the centenary of his birth, in 1869, 25,000 people gathered in New York’s Central Park to hear speakers sing his praises and see a bust unveiled. He never returned to the U.S. but his name is attached to counties, towns and parks across the country.<br />How did such a figure become central to 19th-century American art, culture and science? Why was he then nearly forgotten in the English-speaking world? What brings him to our attention now? This confluence of phenomena, personalities, ideas and history is the subject of this grandly executed, profusely illustrated volume by Eleanor Jones Harvey, senior curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, based on a major exhibition.<br />Unfortunately the exhibition has now fallen victim to the coronavirus, though its cancellation doesn’t consign it to oblivion, thanks to this catalog. When I saw the show before the latest shutdown, it impressed with its range, majesty, seriousness and political significance. It included the first American appearance in 170 years of an enormous mastodon skeleton excavated in 1801 in Orange County, N.Y., by Charles Willson Peale, which took on symbolic importance for the new nation and its president, Thomas Jefferson, and was mounted in Peale’s museum (the nation’s first). This “mammoth,” now in a German collection, was hailed as a reproof to European naturalists who believed the New World offered only corrupted, weakened versions of the Old.<br />There was also a copy of Humboldt’s stupefyingly detailed map of New Spain, illustrating territory from Mexico northward, which gave Jefferson invaluable information about the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase and the boundaries to be negotiated with Spain. Frederic Church’s magnificently scaled “Niagara” (1857) was mounted along with some of his South American landscapes, creating an imagistic conversation with Humboldt’s sketches of the same scenes. On one wall were some of George Catlin’s classic oil portraits of American Indians from the 1830s and ’40s; so important was Humboldt’s friendship that Catlin’s published account of his own travels was embossed with an image of Humboldt greeting an American Iowa. And then there were reminders that the Smithsonian Institution itself was partly inspired by—and associated with—Humboldt and his ideas.</td>

      <td>Ibegan reading “Ice Walker” with trepidation. How could this story, whose main character is a female polar bear, avoid anthropomorphism and sentimentality? Would it devolve into a rant about melting ice and habitat destruction?<br />I need not have worried. Within a few pages I was hooked on a fascinating exploration of ice and snow, seen from the perspective of an apex predator peculiarly adapted to one of the world’s harshest environments. In deceptively simple prose, poetic yet precise, James Raffan invites us into the world of Nanu—short for Nanurjuk, which means “the bear-spirited one” in Inuktitut—as she hunts for seal on Hudson Bay in Canada’s Arctic.<br />The story begins on a frigid day in February, when Nanu is 7 years old and weighs 500 pounds. It is minus-37 degrees Celsius (or minus-35 degrees Fahrenheit) on the vast expanse of ice; at this temperature, we are told, human flesh freezes within minutes. Yet the blood running through the veins and arteries of Nanu’s massive paws remains around plus-37 degrees Celsius. Her feet are not only adapted to the temperature difference, they also leave signals, through her skin glands, to potential mates, announcing that Nanu “is healthy and coming into season.” The drama begins.<br />The ice is “talkative” at this time of year, Mr. Raffan tells us, grinding and crackling, moved by winds and currents. Nanu can feel the vibrations of the ice through those amazing feet and hear them with her ears. These senses also help Nanu hunt for prey, but when it comes to tracking seals nothing beats her extraordinary sense of smell.<br />At a seal’s breathing hole, Nanu quiets her breath, coils back onto her haunches and waits, completely still. “And then, in an explosion of energy, cold air, and flying snow, she rises up and crashes down, punching through the new snow and the crusted dome of the lair onto the unsuspecting adult seal.” Soon she is gulping down mouthfuls of the blubber she needs to sustain herself for the next year, as she births and rears cubs.</td>

The filing of the FTC’s antitrust lawsuit against  Facebook Inc.,  though, was a career-defining act.<br />Not that he wants any of the attention.<br />When the FTC and 46 states unveiled their tandem lawsuits against Facebook Wednesday afternoon, the commission held no press conference, and Mr. Simons said nothing at all. Instead, the FTC posted online a pre-recorded two-minute video by one of Mr. Simons’ deputies, who, with two model sailboats in the background, announced the case from his home.<br />The FTC lawsuit alleges Facebook engaged in an anticompetitive campaign to buy up and shut out rivals. The company rejects the claims as revisionist history and is preparing to battle the FTC in court. The case came on a 3-2 vote, with Mr. Simons, a Republican, joining two Democratic commissioners in the majority. The FTC’s other two GOP members voted no.<br />Mr. Simons, 62 years old, “is not flamboyant. He doesn’t stand up and claim credit. He did not take this job in order to get another job,” said George Washington University law professor William Kovacic, a former FTC chairman who previously worked with Mr. Simons at the commission. “I think he’s done a brilliant job in the hardest possible circumstances.”</td>

Chekhov’s great talent was to reflect people as they are, even when they don’t make sense. The better author knows a hopeful lie often masks a more painful truth. This is probably why I was so deeply affected this year by Isabel Wilkerson’s towering, gorgeous “Caste,” which seeks to explain the hidden and complex system of inequalities at the foundation of American life. It’s this clear-eyed reporting on the truth of America rapt by its prevarications (among which one might now list equality and even democracy itself) that was so refreshing and powerful. And though we seem to be at a moment of change, the painful truth may be that we are more like the lovers in that beguiling final paragraph of “Lady With Lapdog” who realize they have still “a long, long road before them, and that the most complicated and difficult part of it was only just beginning.”<br />— Mr. Jollett is the author of the bestselling memoir “Hollywood Park.”<br /><br />I’ve been reading a lot about women artists this year, so I loved “Actress” by Anne Enright and “Feast Your Eyes” by Myla Goldberg. “Actress” follows an Irish theater legend who leaves behind a messy legacy after she commits an act of violence. “Feast Your Eyes” is centered on a midcentury photographer who takes a controversial picture of her daughter, and the daughter who tells the story of her late mother’s life. Both novels center on mother-daughter relationships complicated, in part, by the pressures of artistic ambition. And both books are about daughters reclaiming the artistic legacies of their brilliant but derided mothers. I also loved “The Glass Hotel” by Emily St. John Mandel, which was the first novel I was able to finish when the lockdown began in the spring. It’s a propulsive story about a Ponzi scheme that weaves in and out of the lives of the scammer, his co-conspirators and his victims.</td>

      <td>Robinhood sure is entertaining. But it’s also steering investors toward risky behaviors that could go wrong.</td>
      <td>Technology can make investing easy and fun. It can also downplay risk in ways that may lead novices astray.<br />In last week’s column, I described my experience on the popular Robinhood brokerage app, especially how trading became hard to stop once I started. Now let’s look at how Robinhood may encourage risky behaviors that could backfire.<br />Consider some exchange-traded funds. Leveraged ETFs magnify the daily return of a market index, typically doubling or tripling it. Inverse ETFs deliver the opposite of a market’s one-day return, often amplifying that gain or loss with leverage. Volatility ETFs are a pure play on the short-term fluctuations of stocks or other assets.<br />Such funds are fireballs that can heat up a portfolio—or scorch it. ProShares UltraPro QQQ, or TQQQ, seeks to deliver three times the daily return of the Nasdaq-100 index. It gained 35% in November. During the February-March market panic, it lost 70%.<br />The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, which oversees brokerage firms, has warned these ETFs “typically are unsuitable for retail investors who plan to hold them for longer than one trading session.”</td>

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s office didn’t respond to questions about why it decided to join the suit now.<br />Mr. Becerra’s move could help placate Republican critics as he seeks confirmation next year as President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.</td>

That suit is supported by at least 17 other Republican attorneys general and 106 GOP members of Congress, but is opposed by Democratic attorneys general and some Republican senators and state officials.<br />In Wisconsin, the Trump campaign sought to have 220,000 mail-in and absentee ballots thrown out from Dane County, home to Madison, and Milwaukee County, the two most urban, diverse and Democratic counties in the state.<br />The campaign earlier requested a recount in those two counties, though the new tally slightly increased Mr. Biden’s lead of about 20,000.</td>

Now those same figures could help decide the fate of Mr. Biden’s policy agenda, particularly with a narrow Democratic majority in the House that includes a contingent of outspoken members.<br />At the same time, Mr. Biden doesn’t want to alienate moderate Democrats and Republicans in the closely divided Senate, which has to confirm his nominees.<br />Mr. Biden formally announced Tom Vilsack as his pick for secretary of Agriculture; Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge for secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Denis McDonough, former chief of staff to President Barack Obama, for secretary of Veterans Affairs; Katherine Tai for U.S. Trade Representative; and former Ambassador Susan Rice as director of the Domestic Policy Council.<br />“Some are familiar faces, some are new in their roles,” Mr Biden said at an event in Wilmington, Del., on Friday. “All are facing new circumstances and challenges.

Over half of Republicans believe the election was “rigged” This may persist in the perception that the Biden administration is now continually under the cloud of illegitimacy. The confidence level in America’s election process has fallen to the level of confidence the electorate has in Congress—dangerous for a form of democratic governance.<br />James Bullard<br />Brighton, Mich.<br /><br />In my little, 80-home neighborhood, the roll of registered voters shows at least five homes with two sets of families, reflecting both the previous and current owners. An additional two people who have died are on the roll. And several young adults who have moved away from their parents’ home are still on the roll. If they had been automatically mailed ballots, more than 10% of homes would have received extra ballots. This is the reality in a state that actually maintains the voter rolls, in a stable neighborhood of mostly middle-aged adults. Imagine what the rate is in, say, an apartment complex.</td>

OMB has one of the most professional workforces in all of government, with unmatched expertise and experience.<br />But I don’t share their overblown concerns about the civil service reforms that President Trump is proposing. Much of the media coverage on the “Schedule F classification” has bordered on the hysterical—claims of “massive government purges” and other easily dismissed boogeymen. Only in D.C. is it this controversial to suggest that federal employees be held accountable for the quality of work they perform.<br />For decades administrations have failed to achieve meaningful civil service reform. Federal employees themselves complain that it is far too difficult to get rid of poor performers. President Trump has found a way to maintain the institutional knowledge and expertise of career professionals who serve permanently and inject accountability for those closest to setting policy.<br />Most people in America serve at the will of their employer and learn to “provide objective and informed advice” while being committed to the organization’s success. This isn’t an unreasonable or outrageous request of federal employees.<br />OMB’s work won’t change: Hard questions will be asked, analysis provided and institutional memory maintained. But the men and women of OMB are not a priestly caste set apart; rather, we are the tip of the spear for implementing a president’s agenda. And that is why OMB must lead in executing this important reform.</td>

      <td>Qualcomm and other chip makers’ shares drop on latest report of Apple’s modem efforts</td>
      <td>Chip makers supplying  Apple  should have learned by now to always consider that business temporary. That doesn’t mean it’s worthless.<br />Intel is only the most recent example, finally losing its place in some of the Mac computer lineup to in-house central processors developed by Apple.  Qualcomm  might be next on the chopping block. Apple’s senior vice president of hardware technologies, Johny Srouji, told employees in a company town hall Thursday that Apple is working on its own modem chips, according to a report by Bloomberg. Modem chips are Qualcomm’s largest business with Apple, with the two companies having recently re-established their relationship following a bitter, multiyear legal dispute.<br />The news took down Qualcomm’s share price by 7.4% Friday. It also seemed to hang over other prominent Apple suppliers such as  Broadcom ,   Qorvo  and  Skyworks Solutions .  All supply radio frequency, or RF, components used in the iPhone. Broadcom shares were down 1% in morning trading despite the company having reported strong results for its fiscal fourth quarter late Thursday. Atif Malik of Citi predicted that Apple would likely look to in-source RF chips after it develops its own modem, given how tightly those components have to work together.<br />But even for Qualcomm, the pain of being replaced by Apple is still some way off—if it happens at all. Mr. Srouji said Apple’s modem effort just kicked off this year, and he described it as a “long-term strategic investment.” The settlement the two companies struck last year included a six-year licensing deal and a “multiyear” chip-supply agreement. Qualcomm’s strong lead in 5G technology was a key factor in driving that settlement, and it isn’t an area in which even Apple will be able to catch up quickly. Tim Arcuri of  UBS  noted Friday that “broad proliferation of a captive modem” on Apple’s part would likely require more expertise in radio-frequency technology that the company may have to acquire through M&A.<br />Apple is ambitious and has deep pockets, along with a well-known desire to control as much of its key technology as it can. That is a risk hanging over any chip company doing business with the tech giant. But those efforts don’t happen overnight: It took Apple a decade to field a competitive PC chip after building its first in-house central processors for the iPhone. That leaves a lot of business that can be done in the meantime, and chip makers who keep their technology well ahead of the pack can maintain their position even longer.</td>
