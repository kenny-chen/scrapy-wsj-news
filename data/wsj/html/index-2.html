      <td>Watchdog had questioned data requests relating to Trump’s push to exclude unauthorized immigrants from aspect of decennial count</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham said Monday he plans to resign, days after a government watchdog questioned his requests for data relating to the Trump administration’s push to exclude unauthorized immigrants from a key aspect of the decennial count.<br />Mr. Dillingham’s resignation is effective Wednesday, he wrote in a post to employees on the Census Bureau site in which he praised their work and dedication. He said he would have left earlier, but a transition official for President-elect Joe Biden invited him to continue serving as bureau director, and “under other circumstances” he would have been honored to stay in his post under the new president.<br />Mr. Dillingham’s resignation comes after the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General issued a memo that raised concerns about his directive for career officials to produce a report that “includes data on documented and undocumented persons in the United States.” Career officials said they were “under significant pressure to produce this technical report,” the OIG memo said.<br />The memo inquired how Mr. Dillingham would ensure the data quality of the report and why the Census Bureau director prioritized the report.<br />Mr. Dillingham addressed the inspector general’s memo at length in his resignation announcement. Mr. Dillingham defended the data request and said it “was not an attempt to release 2020 census data results for apportionment early.”</td>

      <td>Pence, Kudlow, Rao, Pai and more: Here are the Trump appointees and policies that served the country.</td>
      <td>As the Trump Presidency ends in the disgrace of the Capitol riot, an effort is already underway to erase everything in the last four years as disgraceful too. That’s a lie—a Big Lie, to borrow the cliché of the moment. Donald Trump’s profound character flaws need to be separated from what so many people in his Administration accomplished for the country.<br />These men and women didn’t “enable” Donald Trump. Sixty-three million Americans did that when they elected him in 2016, with a significant assist from the Democrats who nominated Hillary Clinton, perhaps the only candidate who could have lost to Mr. Trump.<br />Mr. Trump appointed people who had the usual varying combinations of conviction and ambition. They served despite the hostility of the bureaucracy and press, and a President who often didn’t appreciate their work. Sometimes—in some cases, often—they protected the country by stopping Mr. Trump from his worst impulses.<br />We can’t list everyone who contributed, but before the Biden Presidency begins we thought we’d link some of those who did their jobs well with the successful policies they promoted. We’ve already saluted Betsy DeVos at Education and Ajit Pai at the Federal Communications Commission. Here’s a sample of other significant people and policies:<br />• Larry Kudlow, Kevin Hassett, Casey Mulligan, Gary Cohn, and others on the economic team. The pandemic-lockdown recession has obscured that the pre-Covid U.S. economy was the strongest since the 1990s. Unlike the Obama years, the benefits of growth were widely dispersed, wage gains were strongest for the least skilled, and poverty saw its sharpest decline in decades.</td>

      <td>Elise Stefanik grew up in a working-class family in upstate New York, where her father and mother ran a small plywood distribution business. After getting accepted to Harvard, she became not only the first Ivy Leaguer in her family but also the first to graduate from college.<br />“I’ll never forget what my dad told me the summer before my freshman year,” she tells me. “He said, ‘Elise, I can’t tell you what to expect or what’s going to happen because I never had this experience. I know you will do well and we will be proud of you. All I ask is that you remember where you came from.’ ”<br />He was right: His daughter would make him proud. Two days before she graduated from Harvard in 2006, she received a job offer from the George W. Bush White House (where I was a colleague). Afterward she helped on various Republican campaigns before returning home for a stint with the family business.<br />Then, in 2014, she ran for Congress—and won—in New York’s 21st, a mostly rural, upstate district between Albany and Canada. At the time she was 30, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.<br />But now she’s not good enough for Harvard.</td>

      <td>But formidable global challenges await Joe Biden as he moves into the White House.</td>
      <td>Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Ali Khamenei, Nicolás Maduro and Kim Jong Un doubtless were gleefully munching their popcorn as the violent fringe of a large pro-Trump demonstration stormed the halls of Congress earlier this month. The rioting in Washington and the militarization of the capital for this week’s inauguration telegraph American instability and weakness—something that cheered every U.S. adversary and alarmed every friend around the world.<br />That said, the national and global doom-mongering is overdone. President Trump’s false claims and incendiary rhetoric ignited an ugly incident, not a constitutional crisis. Mr. Trump is too weak and American democracy too strong for any other result. Fundamental U.S. constitutional structures were never in peril. Up and down the line, state election officials from both parties followed the appropriate procedures, at times in the face of bullying and threats.<br />Distinguished lawyers of impeccable Republican and conservative credentials declined to lend their reputations to the weak claims that the president’s campaign sought to litigate. And when those cases came up for judicial scrutiny, courts filled with Trump appointees decided them according to the law. Even those representatives and senators who failed in their duty by echoing the president’s unfounded, inflammatory claims did so secure in the knowledge that their cynical grandstanding wouldn’t overturn the legal process. The American military’s commitment to constitutional order never wavered.<br />The weary capital could still see more violence on Inauguration Day, but the republic stands. The momentary frenzy of a mob or the histrionic demagoguery of a defeated president and his most opportunistic allies notwithstanding, there has not been a moment when there was a real possibility that Mr. Trump’s term of office would extend past its constitutionally mandated close.<br />Counterintuitively, the real message of the 2020 election is that the U.S. remains strong. Voters elected, electors voted, and the transfer of power proceeds apace. A perfect storm—a destructive pandemic, an economic maelstrom, a crisis in race relations, a bitter election campaign and, in the end, the effort of a defeated president to foment all the trouble he could—still couldn’t prevent the constitutional process from taking its course.</td>

      <td>Since 2003, two activist judges on the Third Circuit have been arbitrarily stalling FCC innovation.</td>
      <td>Two judges on the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals have spent the past 17 years blocking a congressionally mandated modernization of antiquated broadcast-television regulations. The Supreme Court will hear an appeal Tuesday, FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, giving broadcasters the chance to be unshackled from restrictions this activist court continues to impose on them—which are contrary to court precedent and statute and make no sense in light of the competition from digital media.<br />At stake are Federal Communications Commission rules that would allow broadcasters to compete more efficiently against less-regulated tech companies, invest more in local news gathering, and strengthen their position as a crucial conduit for free speech.<br />Decades ago, over-the-air broadcast television was the dominant medium on which Americans relied for news, weather and entertainment. To curb broadcasters’ clout, in the mid-20th century the FCC heavily regulated the industry and limited how many TV stations a single owner could have. Congress saw competition coming from cable and the internet and enacted a deregulatory law known as Section 202(h) of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. It mandates that the FCC “shall” repeal or modify any broadcast-ownership rule it determines is no longer “necessary in the public interest as the result of competition.” The Third Circuit’s legal misinterpretation of this statute and the FCC’s obligation to act in the “public interest” are at the heart of the appeal.<br />Over the decades, the FCC, not Congress, created a broad definition of the “public interest” when it came to broadcast ownership rules. Among many factors, the agency has included five different types of “diversity” in its analysis: viewpoint, outlet, program, source and minority and female ownership. But in 1996 Congress singled out “competition,” not diversity, as the primary factor for the FCC to consider in its public-interest analysis.<br />Lawmakers intended Section 202(h) to give broadcasters the freedom to create defensive combinations and economies of scale, thereby liberating capital to invest in societally beneficial programming such as local news and severe-weather warnings. Today broadcasters face declining viewership and slumping ad dollars as viewers turn to alternatives on the internet. Local over-the-air TV ad revenue has plummeted more than 40% since 2000, adjusted for inflation, and the pandemic has made matters worse. Meanwhile, online ad purchases have skyrocketed. Google’s share of local ad revenue in 2019 alone, about $17 billion, was equal to all the local ad income of every TV station across the country combined.</td>

      <td>Daniel Ek wanted to bring Napster’s idea of a musical smorgasbord into the world of legal streaming. Would record labels play along?</td>
      <td>Neil Young, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham owe Daniel Ek an enormous debt of gratitude right about now. The rock legends have all recently sold their song publishing rights for gigantic sums, sell-offs that can partially be attributed to the surge in digital revenue that accounts for more than half the global recorded-music market. One man saw all this coming before anyone else: Mr. Ek, the 37-year-old co-founder of Spotify, the world’s largest streaming service with 320 million users and counting.<br />For those of us who regularly call up almost any song we desire with a tap on our phone screens, it’s easy to think of streaming music as an inevitable development. But for Mr. Ek, streaming’s triumph was more of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Having endured years of pushback, Spotify has been at the vanguard of a global revolution in the way music is consumed. It’s quite a turnabout for the Stockholm native, who has endured heaps of negative press, the enmity of underpaid musicians everywhere, and the looming threat of competing services from Apple, Jay-Z’s Tidal and many others.<br />Co-written by two veteran reporters who have closely tracked the Swedish technology sector, “The Spotify Play” (translated into English by the authors themselves) delivers an outsider-to-kingmaker narrative that should be read by every gun-shy entrepreneur too spooked by Silicon Valley’s giants to go head-to-head with them. Mr. Ek has outlasted his competitors and defied his critics: His triumphs are soundtracked by 1.5 billion user-generated Spotify playlists.<br />A rabid music fan as a teenager, Mr. Ek’s exposure to Napster was a profound conversion experience. Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker’s file-sharing service was the shrapnel blast that tore holes through the web’s commercial firewalls. “Napster is probably the internet service which has changed my life more than anything else,” Mr. Ek once told an interviewer. What if he could merge Napster’s peer-to-peer technology with commercial content? What if he could draw file-sharing out of the shadows?<br />Even while Mr. Ek was rapidly moving up as a programmer in Stockholm’s hot tech market, the notion of a legal answer to Napster’s music streaming never left him. In 2006 Mr. Ek’s tiny startup Advertigo was acquired by Tradedoubler, a digital marketing company whose co-founder Martin Lorentzon was enamored of Mr. Ek and his ideas. The savvy, flamboyant Mr. Lorentzon would become both partner and cheerleader. When he came to visit Mr. Ek in his raffish Stockholm neighborhood, Mr. Ek quoted “The Godfather” at him: “Put your hand in your pocket like you have a gun.”</td>

      <td>Quant pioneer Renaissance Technologies LLC sent clients an analysis of its performance and a rationalization of recent deep losses, an unusual move for one of Wall Street’s most secretive firms.<br />In the letter sent late Friday, the firm said losses of between 20% and 30% in 2020 for its three funds open to outside investors should have been expected at some point during the course of the funds’ histories. The letter partly blamed heightened volatility for the weak performance.<br />Still, some clients said the letter was short on meaningful explanations.<br />The decision to reach out to investors with a letter follows an awful year for several of Renaissance’s hedge funds, with some clients having expressed unhappiness in recent days. The weak performance of some of the firm’s outside funds has spurred investor withdrawals. Renaissance manages nearly $60 billion firmwide, down from about $75 billion a year ago.<br />“Although recent performance has been terrible and worse than prior performance would have suggested was likely for 2020,” the letter says, “in track records as long as ours, some risk-return ratios every bit as bad as the ones we are now seeing are not shocking.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Janet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden’s choice for Treasury secretary, plans to tell lawmakers that the U.S. risks a longer, more painful recession unless Congress approves more aid and urge them to “act big” to shore up the recovery.<br />Ms. Yellen is set to testify Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee, which is considering her nomination, according to a copy of her prepared remarks that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />“Economists don’t always agree, but I think there is a consensus now: Without further action, we risk a longer, more painful recession now—and long-term scarring of the economy later,” Ms. Yellen will say. “Over the next few months, we are going to need more aid to distribute the vaccine; to reopen schools; to help states keep firefighters and teachers on the job.”<br />Mr. Biden’s nomination of Ms. Yellen positions the 74-year-old labor economist to lead his administration’s efforts to advance the recovery from the destruction caused by the coronavirus pandemic and related shutdowns. She will also play a key role in pushing the administration’s economic agenda on Capitol Hill, a job that will start in earnest Tuesday, said Tony Fratto, a senior Treasury and White House aide in the George W. Bush administration.<br />Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, unveiled last week, provides for another round of direct stimulus payments, extended and enhanced jobless benefits, funding for schools and first responders and the creation of a nationwide vaccination program. It also includes longstanding Democratic priorities, such as raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding paid leave for workers.</td>

      <td>Phil Gramm and Mike Solon argue that “The Era of Nonstop Stimulus” (op-ed, Jan. 4) that began in response to the pandemic threatens to become an Obamanomics stimulus sequel on steroids. The Obama economy struggled to exceed 2% a year growth for eight years, as federal debt piled up. The Biden administration now plans to spend trillions of dollars more than the $3.3 trillion of stimulus since the pandemic began.<br />The authors contend that stimulus spending is all about political not economic, outcomes. Mr. Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders’s “unity” document is a playbook for social justice and inclusive economics. Both are about righting America’s past wrongs and creating more dependents on the state. The metrics the authors use for economic success—e.g., 3% annual growth is better than 2%—aren’t the metrics used in inclusive economics. Which groups get the benefits of growth is more important to Democrats than the absolute level of growth. If income inequality is less with 2% growth because of stimulus spending, confiscatory taxes, income redistribution and suboptimal investments by Washington, that is an acceptable tradeoff. If an era of nonstop stimulus ends with economic malaise or collapse, the outcome may be palatable as long as inequality is less when everyone (other than the political class and its cronies) is worse off.<br />Democrats have the media covering their backs when it comes to assigning blame for an economic mess. The left’s control of messaging grew stronger as a result of the mob invasion of the Capitol, with tech giants using it as an excuse to purge social-media voices that disturb progressives.<br />Philip Grant<br />Palm Coast, Fla.</td>

      <td>*Good data mask dangerous imbalances that are growing worse.</td>
      <td>The economic data Beijing released Monday seems to suggest that China has met expectations that it would be the only major economy to grow in 2020. China being China, there’s much more—and less—to the story.<br />The top-line data make China a rare good news story in the pandemic year. Inflation-adjusted GDP growth hit 6.5% in the last three months of the year, making it 2.3% for 2020. This contrasts with the rest of the world, where social distancing and lockdowns have triggered some of the worst contractions on record and raise the specter of long and difficult recoveries.<br />Some of Beijing’s cheerleaders want you to believe this is mainly because the Chinese government acted so aggressively to suppress the pandemic. That story sits uneasily alongside Beijing’s slow-rolling of early information about Covid-19 when more information sharing might have helped other countries.<br />Beijing adopted particularly aggressive lockdowns once it did act, sealing off entire cities and even now locking down apartment buildings or neighborhoods at a moment’s notice to suppress outbreaks. To the extent anyone can trust Beijing’s data about virus spread, it appears to have Covid mostly under control.<br />But a closer look at the economy suggests the growth has come from somewhere other than Beijing’s putative suppression of the pandemic. China’s Communist Party reverted to its old economic-crisis playbook to goose debt and exports while tightening political dominance over the economy.</td>

      <td>The new vice president will spend much of her time helping to shepherd the Biden agenda through a 50-50 Senate</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Upon being sworn in as vice president Wednesday, Kamala Harris will have to balance multiple roles: as a counselor to President-elect Joe Biden, the Senate tiebreaker and the potential standard-bearer for the Democratic Party whose current leaders are in their 70s or 80s.<br />Ms. Harris, who will be the first woman and first Black vice president, will begin her tenure with a broad but undefined portfolio of responsibilities, according to her aides. Both she and Mr. Biden have said she would be a full partner, sharing her opinions on every decision and taking on tasks he won’t have time to manage, as the sharply divided country copes with a pandemic and a still-recovering economy.<br />“There’s not a single decision I’ve made yet about personnel or about how to proceed that I haven’t discussed it with Kamala first,” Mr. Biden said last month.<br />While Mr. Biden, 78, is in good health, he will be the oldest president to be sworn into office, putting the role of Ms. Harris, 56, as next in the line of succession and as a party leader into greater focus. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader from New York, is 70, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, is 80.<br />Ms. Harris’s challenge—as is the case for every vice president—will be to help Mr. Biden’s agenda without contradicting or overshadowing him.</td>

His close association with Mr. Biden has drawn comparisons to James A. Baker III, the longtime friend and political adviser to President George H.W. Bush before becoming his secretary of state, though Mr. Baker came to the post with experience as Treasury Secretary and White House chief of staff during the Reagan administration.<br />For Mr. Blinken, however, a high-profile cabinet position will be a new role. He has spent much of his career in the shadow of his powerful mentor and will now be called on to demonstrate his skills as a foreign-policy strategist and the nation’s chief diplomat.<br />In his Tuesday hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Blinken plans to sketch out a vision in which the U.S. has a central role in wrestling with global problems, uses alliances and international institutions to try to expand its leverage and pursues policies that it can argue benefit the American middle class.<br />That approach is intended to supplant President Trump’s “America First” doctrine as an organizing principle for foreign policy while also seeking to draw popular support for the Biden agenda from voters who might otherwise be sympathetic to Mr. Trump’s approach.</td>

In addition, 11 suffered from dementia and serious co-morbidities such as heart disease.<br />“We have now repeated our existing advice not to give the vaccine to terminally ill patients,” a spokeswoman for the agency said.

It was the first time he had tried to return to Russia since a near-fatal poison attack last August that left him in a coma and undergoing treatment in Germany.<br />He was remanded in custody until Feb. 15, and now faces a court decision that could turn a suspended sentence he received for an embezzlement case in 2014 into a real prison term. Authorities say he violated the terms of his parole while he was abroad recovering from August’s attack.<br />The European Court of Human Rights said in 2018 that the original case was politically motivated and those charges are trumped up. In addition, Russian prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into him for allegedly siphoning donations to his Anti-Corruption Foundation.<br />Mr. Navalny says both legal moves were politically motivated and meant to scare him away from returning to Russia. In short videos from the courtroom distributed among supporters, Mr. Navalny, 44 years old, said his detention showed that Mr. Putin fears his opposition movement, which will seek to make gains in a parliamentary election in September. He also called on supporters to hold public protests in a show of force.</td>

Tesla on Monday said via  Twitter  that “Model Y deliveries in China have officially begun.”<br />Tesla, which broke ground at its Shanghai plant two years ago, rushed to start producing cars there and expand capacity. Manufacturing cars locally helps the Palo Alto, Calif.-based electric vehicle maker save on shipping costs and avoid import duties for the Chinese market.<br />The Model Y is the second Tesla vehicle that the EV maker is producing at Shanghai after the Model 3 sedan, which the company started delivering a year ago in China—which was marked with a visit to the plant by Chief Executive Elon Musk. As it ramped up production of the sedan last year, it was also building the assembly line in Shanghai for the Model Y.<br />The Model 3 was the bestselling electric vehicle in China last year, with more than 138,000 sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association—an eighth of the 1.11 million EVs sold nationwide.</td>

      <td>A venture to launch small satellites using a rocket fired from a converted jumbo jet deployed 10 tiny ones into orbit for the first time Sunday, providing a big boost for the startup founded by entrepreneur Richard Branson.<br />The successful demonstration flight by Southern-California-based Virgin Orbit, nearly eight months after a botched test, lifts the company into the select group of small-satellite launch providers able to offer flight-proven hardware.<br />With the proliferation of small-satellite manufacturers across the U.S. and other regions, specialized launch providers are rushing to fill the demand to blast their products into space. They include Rocket Lab, a U.S.-New Zealand company that has a flight-proven rocket; Texas-based Firefly Aerospace; and Relativity Space, which plans to launch 3-D manufactured rockets. But only a few of the startups can claim the distinction of blasting out of the atmosphere, a goal Mr. Branson and his team have pursued for years, even as more-conventional rocket designs grabbed most of the public attention.<br />Virgin Orbit’s novel airborne platform, a specially outfitted  Boeing Co.  747 jet named Cosmic Girl, climbed to an altitude of roughly 6 miles above the Pacific Ocean and released a slender, 70-foot rocket slung under its left wing. The booster’s main liquid-fueled engine roared to life, transporting the cluster of cubesats, or miniature satellites, built by universities and sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, into low-Earth orbit.<br />Mr. Branson said the company’s LauncherOne rocket would encourage “a whole new generation of innovators on the path to orbit.” Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart said the company managed to demonstrate every element of its launch system. The next mission is slated to begin commercial operations, with customers including the U.K.’s Air Force and low-cost communications provider Swarm Technologies Inc.</td>

      <td><br />In a world of masks, it’s harder than ever to read the faces around us. Only now are scientists learning how we manage without the revealing tells of smiles, sneers, dimples and frowns that signal our state of mind, as masks in public settings become common in more than 50 countries.<br />While a public health necessity, masks challenge our skill in understanding facial expressions, confusing our ability to distinguish disgust from anger or happiness from indifference, several new studies say. Scientists worry about the implications for infants and children who may lag in learning to recognize subtle facial signals of anger, fear, doubt, delight and sorrow. While data is sparse, one new study suggests that children have as much trouble reading facial expressions when people are wearing masks as when they are wearing sunglasses.<br />In that test, the children correctly identified the emotional expression on uncovered faces about 66% of the time, well above the odds of just guessing, psychologist Ashley Ruba at the University of Wisconsin-Madison said. Looking at faces in surgical-type masks, however, the children were only able to correctly identify sadness about 28% of the time, anger 27% of the time, and fear 18% of the time.<br />“For very young children, I think it is still an open question as to how they’ll navigate these situations,” said Dr. Ruba, who studies how children learn to understand other people’s emotions. “Infants can use all these other cues, like tone of voice.”</td>

Official Saudi announcements show no drug-related executions since January 2020, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch.<br />The move comes as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appeals to Western tourists and foreign investors put off by Saudi Arabia’s reputation as a bastion of ultraconservative social norms enforced by religious police. Beheadings and crucifixions were once commonplace in public squares, including in the center of Riyadh, the capital.</td>

For the ice dance champions, Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue, it would help stake their claim for a 2022 Olympic medal, after several years of trading places with other couples for the top position in the U.S.<br />For the U.S. ladies, including champion Bradie Tennell, strong showings would allow them to field three Olympic entries and increase the chances that at least one female skater might be able to break through and return an American to the podium for the first time since 2006. And for the beleaguered U.S. pairs, securing even two Olympic entries would allow them to halt the American slide in that discipline.<br />But the coronavirus pandemic has the 2021 world championships in Stockholm teetering, after the virus already forced the cancellation of the 2020 world championships set for Montreal last March. The victorious U.S. skaters are keenly aware that the tickets they’ve just punched may be tickets to nowhere.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—When President-elect Joe Biden’s advisers wrote his climate plan, they often had one small audience in mind: the U.S. Senate.<br />That chamber has been reluctant to forcefully address climate issues with major new laws, but expectations are growing after election victories in Georgia Jan. 5 gave Democrats Senate control. The shift has made infrastructure funding for cleaner energy a realistic possibility and offers a likely kick-start for Mr. Biden’s ambitious agenda.<br />The Democratic control is still narrow—both parties have 50 Senate seats and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaks ties—and that is likely to limit how far Mr. Biden and fellow Democrats can reach. But the Biden team has tailored some of its plans for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to benefit auto makers, oil and gas producers, and utilities, an appeal to moderate Democrats and some Republicans in the Senate needed to pass legislation.<br />Mr. Biden, as a candidate, had called for $2 trillion in spending on projects to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions that most scientists implicate in climate change.<br />Democrats have rallied behind consensus studies that call for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions in half by 2030 and effectively ending them by roughly 2050 to avoid catastrophic consequences.  But many still consider it politically unpalatable to respond with new taxes or regulatory powers that might hurt industry. That leaves government investment through direct spending, loans and tax breaks as the most widely popular ideas.</td>

      <td>Why the house I run will bring out Josh Hawley’s new book.</td>
      <td>I am an independent book publisher, and in recent days I have been taking calls from journalists asking which authors I would refuse to publish. That’s an odd question to ask an American publisher, but suddenly it seems to be on everyone’s mind in our industry. Some 250 self-described “publishing professionals”—mostly junior employees of major houses—have issued a statement titled “No Book Deals for Traitors,” a category in which they include any “participant” in the Trump administration.<br />Readiness to silence someone because of who he is or whom he associates with is often called the “cancel culture,” but I prefer an older term—blacklisting—whose historical associations expose the ugliness of what is going on. Not so long ago, publishing professionals would have been horrified to be accused of it. Today they compete to see who can proclaim his blacklist with the fiercest invective.<br />On Jan. 6, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri invoked his legal right to object to Congress’s certification of electoral votes. Reasonable people can disagree whether his act was noble or cynical, courageous or rash, but no one can reasonably argue that he intended to incite that afternoon’s invasion of the Capitol by a lawless mob. He immediately and forcefully condemned the attack. But the next day Simon & Schuster canceled his forthcoming book, “The Tyranny of Big Tech,” citing the senator’s “role in what became a dangerous threat.”<br />I started getting calls from reporters in effect daring me not to join the blacklisters and from publishers, editors and agents who wondered when and how the mob would come for them.<br />The founder of my publishing house, Henry Regnery, proudly called himself a “dissident publisher.” The conservative books to which he devoted his fortune and career were no more in favor in 1951, when he published William F. Buckley’s “God and Man at Yale,” than they have been during my own 25 years in this business. But blacklisting then, though real, was discreet. Everyone knew it was un-American. No one was proud of it.</td>

      <td>Greenback edged higher after Journal reported that Janet Yellen would diverge from Trump’s weaker-dollar-is-better stance</td>
      <td>The dollar is up more than 1.5% against a basket of other major currencies since its recent low, confounding expectations of a tumbling greenback in 2021. Some investors and analysts expect any strength to be short-lived.<br />The  ICE  U.S. Dollar index rose to almost 91 Monday while U.S. stock and bond markets were closed, according to FactSet, up from 89.4 on Jan. 5, which had been its lowest level since mid-April 2018.<br />The dollar’s recovery comes as Janet Yellen, Joe Biden’s nominee for Treasury secretary, is expected to signal that the new administration will depart from President Trump’s regular demands for a weaker dollar. The former head of the Federal Reserve plans to affirm a commitment to market-driven exchange rates when she testifies in Senate hearings on Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported.<br />“This just rubs in this doubt among investors” who have bet heavily against the dollar, said Jane Foley, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank.<br />In futures markets, investors have piled into bets on a weakening dollar. Net bets against the dollar are almost as high as they were in late September, according to an analysis of Commodity Futures Trading Commission data by the  Royal Bank of Canada ,  which was the most negative the market had been since April 2018.</td>

      <td>The ruling coalition collapses in a fight over spending EU money.</td>
      <td>A new year brings a new political crisis for Italy, as former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi withdrew last week from the motley coalition government in Rome. Setting aside the operatic personal feuds in play, this episode highlights a serious challenge for Europe as Covid-19 spending relief efforts get underway in earnest.<br />Mr. Renzi withdrew his support from Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s coalition, leaving the government several seats short of a majority in the parliament’s upper chamber. Much of the motivation appears to be personal pique of little interest to anyone other than Italian politicos.<br />But there is a kernel of a serious policy question. Italy stands to be the largest recipient from the €750 billion Covid-19 recovery fund the European Union has created, and Messrs. Conte and Renzi have spent weeks feuding over how Rome’s expected €209 billion share of that grants-and-loans pot should be spent. Mr. Conte would prefer to put himself and a clutch of appointed technocrats in charge of disbursing the funds. Mr. Renzi demanded more parliamentary oversight.<br />The mystery is why so many fervent supporters of a greater fiscal role for the EU appear to be taking Mr. Conte’s side in this fight. They complain Mr. Renzi would empower Italy’s notoriously dysfunctional parliament to divvy up European grants for political purposes, and suggest he should get out of the way so Rome can get on with the spending.<br />But Mr. Conte’s early drafts of his spending plans would empower Italy’s equally dysfunctional bureaucracy to throw around the cash for different political reasons. Better to take the waste, fraud and abuse that comes with at least some democratic oversight.</td>

      <td>Years later, Democratic prosecutors charge former Gov. Rick Snyder.</td>
      <td>Nine people, including former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, were criminally charged last week in connection with the yearslong crisis in Flint’s drinking water. The public indictments are terse, with little evidence. So it’s difficult not to wonder if the case against Mr. Snyder, especially, is politicizing the tragedy.<br />The charges range in severity. The former director of the Michigan health department faces nine counts of involuntary manslaughter, each punishable by 15 years. Two of Flint’s former emergency managers are charged with misconduct, a combined seven counts that each carry five years. The ex-head of the city’s public works department could get two years for willful neglect of duty.<br />That’s also the charge against Mr. Snyder. One count says he willfully neglected his duty under the Michigan constitution “by failing to inquire into the performance, condition and administration of the public offices and officers that he appointed and was required to supervise.” A second count says Mr. Snyder neglected his legal duty “by failing to declare a state of emergency and/or disaster” in Flint after he was notified of the water crisis.<br />“The secrecy provisions over the grand jury proceedings do not allow for discussion of the grand jury evidence,” the state Attorney General’s office said. A prosecutor argued Thursday that this “goes far beyond leading a large organization and someone in your organization makes a mistake.” But Mr. Snyder’s indictment, by a single judge acting as grand juror, raises the eyebrow. It cites the state’s emergency law, which says that the Governor “shall” declare a disaster “if he or she finds” that one exists or is threatened, which sounds like a judgment call.<br />Mr. Snyder’s successor, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, wildly abused her authority under the same law, as the Michigan Supreme Court said last year. Disaster declarations are limited to 28 days unless the Legislature extends them. As a work-around, Ms. Whitmer opted to declare repeated new emergencies for identical reasons.</td>

      <td>Car giant formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and French peer PSA can make valuable cost savings but also has some expensive problems</td>
      <td>The merger of Fiat Chrysler and its French peer PSA will create a trans-Atlantic giant out of two smaller car makers. One of its biggest challenges is to go truly global.<br />Shares in Stellantis—the new company’s name, apparently derived from the Latin for “to brighten with stars”—rose roughly 6% on the morning of their first trading day in Paris and Milan on Monday. The deal was wound up rapidly after receiving antitrust clearance from the European Union before Christmas. The company agreed to some remedies in the region’s van market. The shares start trading in New York on Tuesday.<br />Based on analysts’ revenue forecasts for 2020, Stellantis will be the world’s fourth-largest auto maker by revenues, behind  Volkswagen ,   Toyota  and Daimler. By expected operating profits, which matter more as the industry grapples with an expensive transition to electric vehicles, it will be the third largest, behind  Toyota  and  General Motors .<br />The deal’s biggest advantage is its consolidation of the fragmented and fiercely competitive European market. Through November, Fiat Chrysler had a 6.6% share of passenger-vehicle sales in the region last year, while PSA’s brands—Peugeot, Citroën, Opel and Vauxhall—had 15.4%. Merging the two will release €5 billion in cost savings, equivalent to $6 billion, says Stellantis, which is more than 40% of the companies’ combined 2019 operating profit. Chief executive Carlos Tavares has a proven template to follow, having absorbed the European business of General Motors for PSA.<br />Yet the merger also brings another benefit, less concrete but longer-lasting: It creates a company with roughly equal heft on either side of the Atlantic. Despite the Italian-American roots of Fiat Chrysler, the company has made the vast majority of profits in the U.S. in recent years, thanks to strong sales of RAM pickup trucks and Jeep sport-utility vehicles. PSA was an overwhelmingly European business.</td>

      <td>A Hall of Fame quarterback has a new team in yet another conference title game. Green Bay looms</td>
      <td>Tom Brady needs to settle down. He’s making the rest of us look bad. Another Super Bowl is on the verge, and once more, here is Brady, age 78, or rather 43, solid arm, fab mane, on a new team, in a new state, amid a new conference, and, after Tampa Bay’s 30-20 victory over New Orleans on Sunday, just one win away from reaching the NFL’s grandest stage, for the 10th time in his historic career.<br />It’s too much. He’s showing off. At his age, Tom Brady should be at home, rump on the couch, hand sunk into nachos, struggling to stay awake for the second half of an NFL playoff game—not playing in one. Instead, Brady is football’s Benjamin Button, aging in reverse, denying himself onion rings and chocolate cake and extending a playing career well past the standard expiration. Brady is in his 21st season, and next Sunday’s NFC Championship versus the Green Bay Packers will be the 14th conference title game he’s played in, a ridiculous rate of success. He and the Bucs will face the talented Packers sprite Aaron Rodgers, who is 37 years old, or, as Brady calls it, midcareer.<br />How long does Brady go? Unclear. He is under contract for another season in Tampa Bay, and he does not appear to be tumbling to the mean. After upping sticks in New England after two dynastic decades, abandoning the joy of sleet and Bill Belichick for sun and groovy Bruce Arians, Brady turned in a stirring snowbird season: 4,633 yards passing, and 40 touchdowns, the latter a franchise record. Change is supposed to be a chore at an advanced age, but Brady has revived Tampa Bay, delivering the team its first two playoff victories since its Super Bowl in 2003. Should the Bucs somehow scoot past the Pack—a big if, as the game is at Lambeau, and Green Bay might be the best of the four remaining playoff teams—Tampa would be the first club to ever host a Super Bowl in its home stadium. As Florida codas go, Brady’s had one of the sprightliest.<br />He just keeps on keeping on. Sunday’s divisional round contest—the Blanda Bowl, Brady versus the 42-year-old Drew Brees, a combined octogenarian between them—wasn’t exactly a showcase of age defiance. Brady looked rough at first. Brees, reported by Fox Sports’s Jay Glazer to be on the edge of retirement, looked rougher, throwing three interceptions on the evening. Honestly, the most impressive QB moment came from a millennial: New Orleans backup Jameis Winston, age 27, who stepped in for a trick-play cameo and a 56-yard touchdown strike for the Saints.<br />There are indeed moments when Brady looks 43, or at least not a day under 39. Entering Sunday’s 6:40 p.m. ET start, there was a comical narrative that Brady’s performance in night games had been lately subpar because, on an ordinary evening, he usually puts himself to bed early, somewhere around 9 p.m. It sounded like a dig at Brady’s fussy, restrictive lifestyle. People were worrying about Tom Brady like parents lamenting a fitful toddler. If he’s not finished with the football game and in his pajamas at 8:30, he’s going to be a tantrum nightmare tomorrow. No, he cannot have another “Frog and Toad” story! Lights out!</td>

      <td>The 27-year-old star breaks record for most streams by a country album in a week</td>
      <td>Morgan Wallen broke the record for the most streams by a country album in a week, as country music gets more traction online and becomes a bigger part of overall listening on streaming services.<br />“Dangerous: The Double Album,” by the mullet-wearing country star from East Tennessee, tops the latest Billboard 200 album chart, powered by its 240 million U.S. streams in the week ended Jan. 14. That more than doubles the prior record, 102 million streams, achieved by Luke Combs last October. In its debut week, “Dangerous” also sold 74,000 U.S. copies as a full package, bringing its total to the equivalent of 265,000 in sales, according to MRC Data, formerly Nielsen Music.<br />“Dangerous,” which was released on Jan. 8 on Big Loud Records and Republic Records, is considered a bid for superstardom by Mr. Wallen, whose rapid rise has captured the attention of music-industry watchers. Billboard magazine, the music trade publication, put Mr. Wallen on its cover this month. The New Yorker magazine called him “the most wanted man in country.” Mr. Wallen also made headlines when “Saturday Night Live” dis-invited him as musical guest, after he broke Covid-19 protocols, before inviting him again in December.<br />“The guy seems capable of becoming Garth Brooks for a new generation,” Chris DeVille, senior news editor at music website Stereogum, wrote this month.<br />Mr. Wallen’s popularity is a big moment for country music, which historically has lagged behind hip-hop, rock and pop on streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. Increasingly, more country stars are succeeding thanks in part to streaming, with Sam Hunt, Luke Combs and Gabby Barrett joining streaming success stories like Florida Georgia Line.</td>

      <td>Many of the new habits consumers formed during the coronavirus pandemic are here to stay, market researcher Euromonitor International predicts.<br />In 2021 consumers will be demanding, anxious, and creative in dealing with change, Euromonitor forecasts in its annual trend report. People will expect increased activism from brands they use, new options for digital services in their daily lives, and more help in achieving mental and physical wellness.<br />Though some of this year’s trends are directly related to Covid-19—like heightened safety concerns and demand for more open-air spaces—these shifts will continue after the pandemic wanes, says Alison Angus, Euromonitor’s head of lifestyle research. “These changes happened so quickly and have quickly manifested for the long term,” she says.<br />Euromonitor, a global market-research firm based in London, has released its forecasts since 2010. Last year, just three months after publishing its January 2020 predictions, it revised its expectations to reflect dramatic shifts in consumer behavior spurred by the pandemic, flagging new trends like the home’s transformation into a multifunctional refuge used for work, school, leisure and exercise. It also noted the pause of other trends like previously rising privacy concerns.<br />Its forecasts haven’t always come true, at least so far: Euromonitor’s 2018 prediction that DNA-informed personalized nutrition and skin-care products would quickly accelerate didn't come to pass because such regimens remain too onerous, Ms. Angus says. Last year’s expected boom in demand for reusable products also didn’t materialize amid consumers’ sanitary concerns during the pandemic. “Sustainability really took a hit last year,” Ms. Angus says. “But I think consumers are reverting back to it.”</td>

And he feels for you.<br />“You don’t have anything on your side right now,” says the University of Calgary business professor and author of “The Procrastination Equation.” “You’re on the windswept plains with no way of hiding from that cold breeze. You are completely exposed.”<br />The pandemic has brought us to peak procrastination. Turns out your office—in addition to being in plain sight of your boss—came with environmental cues that reminded you that you had to, you know, work. Without the hum of the industrial printer and the sight of colleagues marching off to the conference room, we all tend toward aimlessness.<br />“If you don’t have routine, you’re just making it a question mark again. Will I, won’t I?” Dr. Steel says. “Asking yourself what you want to do—you probably want to actually check what’s on Instagram.”</td>

      <td>Startup Sana Biotechnology could go public at a $10 billion valuation. Recent history suggests the high price tag may be worth it.</td>
      <td>A biotechnology startup is poised to go public with a roughly $10 billion price tag a year before it begins human clinical trials for its drug candidates. That isn’t as crazy as it sounds.<br />Sana Biotechnology, which is developing cell-engineering platforms that it says could change the way many diseases are treated, plans to sell $150 million of stock in a coming initial public offering, the company said in a securities filing last week. While it is unknown how many shares it plans to sell, investors are expecting a valuation of between $9 billion and $12 billion.<br />The Sana IPO is arriving as biotech stocks are near records. A broad index of small and midsize biotech firms has rallied about 60% in the past year. And Sana won’t be delivering on its promises anytime soon: Clinical trials in humans for its drug candidates won’t begin until 2022.<br />That backdrop will understandably scare some investors. Ambitions to tackle cancer, diabetes and central-nervous-system disorders under one roof aren’t cheap. While Sana has $459 million in cash and equivalents on its books, it spent $153 million on research and development in the first nine months of 2020, up from $80 million over the same period in 2019. Expenses tend to grow as drug programs advance to later stages. Furthermore, stocks with a long-dated potential payoff, like speculative biotechs, are likely to underperform should the Federal Reserve choose to tighten monetary policy. And of course, drug development is notoriously uncertain, and there is a chance that a Sana drug candidate never reaches the market.<br />That logic, however, would have caused investors to eschew Moderna when it went public in late 2018 at a $7 billion valuation, which at the time was a record for a biotech IPO. Those who bought and held have enjoyed a sevenfold return on their investment in just over two years. That trade wasn’t merely a lucky speculation, either: The company expects at least $11.7 billion in revenue this year from government-purchase agreements for its Covid-19 vaccine, and its success in developing an effective vaccine so quickly bodes well for its other programs in development.</td>

But the conversation in the wake of the storming of the Capitol was particularly daunting because of its historic nature and the political sensitivities embedded in it, he said.<br />Some students said President Trump incited the riot; others said he just gave a speech. In a vigorous, civil debate, the teens looked up the definition to incite and discussed the constitutional right to protest and the 25th amendment.<br />At the end, Mr. Ridenour tied what happened at the Capitol back to their lesson on civic virtues like honor, respect and responsibility. “Regardless of where you stand on this, if you look at these virtues did you feel like it was on display with what occurred?” he asked. The students held firm to their different opinions, he said.<br />The Capitol riot and this week’s presidential inauguration have become teachable moments in classes around the nation, pulling civics education to the forefront as teachers say they face new questions from students and others say it all exemplifies the need for a better civics curriculum and funding.</td>

      <td>Turning around the chip maker will require not only sorting out manufacturing problems but also selling stakeholders on tough decisions about the company’s future</td>
      <td>How hard will the new  Intel  chief executive’s job be? The company’s top rival just gave some important clues.<br />Pat Gelsinger doesn’t start at the company until mid-February, but Intel’s fourth-quarter results Thursday afternoon will likely give a strong sign of at least his initial path. Intel has promised to use the occasion to update investors about its continuing manufacturing problems. The company has also said it would indicate whether it intends to stick with its long-running practice of being the sole manufacturer of the chips it designs, or whether it will begin outsourcing the production of some future designs, very likely to  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ,  or TSMC.<br />Mr. Gelsinger’s long tenure as an Intel engineer strongly suggests the chip maker isn’t ready to throw in the towel just yet on manufacturing. But competing with an ascendant TSMC will be a daunting task. TSMC reported Thursday that revenue for 2020 surged 31%—its best growth in more than a decade—to a record $45.5 billion. And demand is so hot for the company’s manufacturing services that TSMC also plans to pour a record amount into capital expenditures for the coming year to expand its capacity. The chip maker expects to spend between $25 billion and $28 billion for 2021—double the annual capex bill that Intel has averaged over the past five years.<br />Intel is still a much bigger company, with 2020 revenue projected to land around $75.3 billion—up 5% from the previous year. But the recent lift from booming PC sales and data-center demand won’t solve the company’s manufacturing woes. Wall Street currently expects Intel’s revenue this year to fall 7%—which would be the company’s worst decline in more than a decade. TSMC is projected to boost revenue 20% to about $54.4 billion for 2021, according to FactSet.<br />Intel says it has made strong progress on its 7-nanometer manufacturing process, which has been the source of recent trouble. But TSMC is now making more advanced chips en masse at 5 nanometers. The company is already developing its 3-nanometer process, which it said Thursday would be producing chips in volume by the second half of 2022. That means that even if Mr. Gelsinger is successful at getting Intel’s manufacturing process back on track, the company will still be badly lagging. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein says Intel’s disadvantage to TSMC is “likely set in stone” for at least the next three years.</td>

I’m capable of forming my own ideas,” the 33-year-old nurse says. “There is some mistrust of the authorities on my part, when you see how the crisis has been managed in France from the start.”<br />France’s mass vaccination campaign is off to a glacial start, with only around 422,000 people receiving the vaccine in more than three weeks since European regulators authorized the drug, far behind most other developed nations. A big reason: French officials are running up against deeply ingrained opposition that has made France among the world’s top vaccine skeptics.<br />An Ipsos poll conducted in December found that France ranked at the bottom of 15 countries on willingness to take a Covid-19 vaccine, with only 40% of the public saying they wanted the shot. Polls show that more than three-quarters of nursing home workers—who are among the government’s first target groups for the vaccine—don’t want to take it.<br />The resistance has historical roots in the 19th century, when antivaccination groups campaigned against modern inoculation techniques discovered by Frenchman Louis Pasteur. In recent years, it has been fueled by widespread distrust of the government of President Emmanuel Macron, who has faced years of protests from the antiestablishment yellow-vests movement.</td>

There has been no evidence of widespread electoral fraud.<br />“What has happened shows that nothing is forever, that history has not ended, and that even the foundations of the world are changing,” Mr. Siemoniak said.<br />With President-elect Joe Biden set to be sworn in on Wednesday behind a screen of heavy security, democratic leaders and those fighting for democracy around the world say the upheaval in the U.S. has left them shaken. And authoritarian governments, like those of America’s biggest strategic rivals China and Russia, are touting what they say is the superiority of their own political systems.</td>

      <td>BEIJING—China’s geopolitical rise over the past four decades has been fueled by sizzling economic growth that regularly featured years of double-digit percentage-point gains.<br />In 2020, China advanced its aspirations by simply emerging with its growth intact from a brutal year when a pandemic shook the world economy.<br />On Monday, Beijing said its gross domestic product rose 2.3% last year. While that is the weakest annual rate of growth since the Mao era, it was enough to make China the only major world economy to gain any ground at all last year, and accelerated its likely overtaking of the U.S. economy, economists say.<br />The World Bank projects the global economy to have pulled back by 4.3% last year, dragged down by a 7.4% contraction in the eurozone. The U.S., the world’s largest economy, is expected to have shrunk by 3.6%.<br />In per-capita terms, China’s GDP, which surpassed $10,000 for the first time this year, remains far behind the U.S.’s $65,000. But the sheer size of its market, combined with its weathering of the worst economic downturn in memory, means that China is arguably entering the new year with a stronger hand—an advantage that leader Xi Jinping is expected to make use of after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn into office on Wednesday.</td>

Executives say to expect a cascade of rescheduling that stretches into the summer moviegoing season.<br />“Morbius,” a “Spider-Man” spinoff scheduled for release by Sony Pictures Entertainment on March 19, will now debut on Oct. 8, giving the studio a seven-month leeway and delaying what was expected to be the first big-budget, wide-release offering since theaters closed last March.<br />Hollywood executives anticipate more major releases to follow, including the twice-delayed James Bond installment “No Time to Die,” currently planned for an April release that now seems a remote possibility. Sony’s new “Cinderella” adaptation and the  Walt Disney Co.  prequel “The King’s Man,” both scheduled for release within the next two months, could get bumped as well.<br />Chris Aronson, president of domestic distribution at  ViacomCBS Inc.’s  Paramount Pictures, projects moviegoing will resume to varying degrees in May and June ahead of a “very bullish” third quarter. For his part, he has scheduled one of his studio’s biggest 2021 movies, “Top Gun: Maverick,” to premiere July 2, and said he doesn’t expect that date to change.</td>

It isn’t hyperbole to describe the tasks facing Washington’s new political alignment as unprecedented.<br />Mr. Biden starts off with two broad problems no modern president has ever faced: a continuing pandemic and a predecessor who has worked tirelessly to convince Americans that the past election was illegitimate. On top of that, Mr. Biden also will be taking office on the steps of a Capitol still bearing the scars left by a mob of Trump supporters set on stopping him from taking office.<br />Pile on top of that a Congress that is more evenly divided between the two parties than at any point in 20 years, the largest federal debt as a share of the economy since World War II and a rising global competitor in China, and the tasks are genuinely daunting.<br />So, the list of problems to be tackled is long.

In Sweden, trucking giant Scania AB has developed a truck with utility  E.ON SE  that can be charged overhead and is ready for mass production, while a startup will soon test wirelessly charged buses in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.<br />“Charging should not be considered a pain and should not act as a brake on electric vehicle use and deployment,” said Xavier Serrier, who is leading Renault’s charging project. “Technically speaking, it works,” he said of the technology.</td>

In Britain’s case, uncertainty over the outcome of the country’s complicated divorce from the European Union extended that weakness into early fall.<br />But the fourth quarter marked a rebound in mergers and acquisitions in the U.K. as a vaccination program raised the prospect of bringing the virus under control. And Britain’s trade deal, which took effect at the start of January, assured companies and their advisers that the country’s exporters won’t face tariffs and quotas selling into the EU market.<br />The deal revival is illustrated by  MGM Resorts International ’s  unsolicited £8.09 billion, equivalent to $11 billion, bid this month for the U .K.’s  Entain  PLC, along with takeover battles for U.K. companies  Signature Aviation  PLC,  G4S  PLC and  Codemasters Group Holdings  PLC. At the same time, it reaffirms Britain’s reputation as one of the markets most open to takeover activity.<br />Though historically common, these types of contests were largely absent last year until 2020’s final quarter.

From 2015 to 2019, NFL quarterbacks were held out a median of seven days after suffering a concussion in a game, according to the league. The AFC Championship is exactly a week after Sunday’s game—meaning Mahomes would have to return earlier than normal to play.<br />It’s also not as simple as Mahomes saying he feels ready to play.

That sets the country up well for a strong 2021, before some familiar challenges reassert themselves.<br />Official full-year figures released Monday confirmed that China’s economy is firmly on the mend, having performed impressively in the worst year for the global economy in recent memory.<br />This is partly because China handled the pandemic well, after initial missteps. But it was also lucky, both with its business cycle and because its key export industry, electronics, happened to uniquely benefit from pandemic-related demand in rich countries.<br />Although it wasn’t broadly appreciated at the time, China’s economy was already perking up in late 2019 due to the reviving fortunes of two of its largest, most labor-intensive manufacturing sectors: electronics and automobiles. Electronics in particular were boosted first by rebounding global smartphone shipments and then supercharged by demand for stay-at-home goods.<br />Profits in electronics and autos logged their strongest performances last year since 2017, growing 15.7% and 7.2%, respectively, in the first 11 months of the year compared with the same period in 2019.

However, the rollout there has highlighted questions concerning the lack of transparency about the efficacy of the state-sponsored Sputnik V, which has stirred some distrust among Argentines about its safety.<br />Moscow approved Sputnik V for domestic use in August before finishing trials.

Eight countries outside Russia have authorized the shot for emergency use.<br />Still, Sputnik V hasn’t been approved by Western health authorities or received authorization from the WHO, which many developing countries rely on for vetting vaccines.

South Korea’s Supreme Court ordered a retrial in 2019, leading to Monday’s verdict.<br />South Korean law gives judges discretion to suspend sentences of up to three years. But while delivering Monday’s verdict, the Seoul High Court judges said they believed Mr. Lee’s charges required him to serve more time in prison.<br />Wearing a dark tie and a face mask to court, Mr. Lee was taken into custody after the verdict. Mr. Lee is allowed to appeal his case to the nation’s Supreme Court, though overturning his new sentence is unlikely, South Korean legal experts say. A  Samsung Electronics Co.  spokesman declined to comment.<br />Mr. Lee’s absence leaves Samsung rudderless for the second time in four years as the technology giant struggles to chart a path out of the global Covid-19 pandemic. Going by “Jay Y. Lee” in the West, he had led the Samsung conglomerate since his father was incapacitated by a stroke in 2014. He was expected to formally take the Samsung chairmanship following the October death of his father, Lee Kun-hee.</td>

      <td>A cold snap and a supply crunch have created a perfect storm, but the pendulum is likely to swing the other way soon</td>
      <td>It’s been a wild year for commodity markets, marked by despair last spring as the world ground to a halt and followed more recently by exuberance. Nowhere has the bullish feeling been more evident than the usually staid market for liquefied natural gas: February futures for Asian gas hit nearly $20 per million British thermal units last week according to data from Refinitiv. As recently as mid-December, they were only trading around $8 per MMBtu.<br />Unfortunately for gas producers, today’s prices aren’t sustainable and the longer-term supply picture is bearish. Supply stoppages combined with the coldest winter in Asia in decades are a perfect market for those gas producers who still have capacity to supply spot shipments—including U.S. firms like Cheniere. But futures are already pricing in warmer weather a few months out: the April contract is currently trading around $7 per MMBtu.<br />Further out, Chinese demand is still the swing factor—as it is for most industrial commodities. Here the news is bullish, but perhaps less so than some LNG vendors might hope. Chinese demand continues to expand robustly, and China continues to consume far more gas than it produces. The bad news is that the growth of that supply gap has slowed noticeably in recent years.<br />New policies introduced in 2018 and 2019—including a 30% resource tax cut for shale gas and a subsidy pegged to how fast drillers increase output of shale gas and other forms of so-called unconventional gas—have sparked a sharp rise in investment. Chinese oil and gas exploration and development spending rose 25.5% in 2019, according to S&P Global. Natural gas production in 2019 rose faster than consumption for the first time since 2015, improving by 10%.<br />More recently, production growth in the first 11 months of 2020 was also about 9% compared with a year earlier. Annual output growth only averaged 6.7% from 2011 to 2018. And new pipeline capacity for gas from Russia is also poised to come online, which could boost pipeline gas imports that have mostly been flattish in recent years.</td>

Whatever relatively small near-term fiscal savings might accrue will be outweighed in the long term by increased threats not only from Moscow, but also from Beijing and rogue states aspiring to become nuclear powers.<br />Mr. Biden’s first arms-control decision will be whether and for how long to extend the New Start treaty. It expires Feb. 5, but can be extended for up to five more years, in whole or in part. The threat of the treaty’s expiration should be negotiating leverage for the U.S., but Mr. Biden appears certain to extend it in some form. Vladimir Putin recently proposed a one-year extension, perhaps worried he had received no signals from the president-elect. Mr. Biden should offer six months, thus keeping the heat on, and showing that his team will be more than stenographers for Moscow’s diplomats.<br />The hard policy questions are still the ones Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev and I discussed in August 2018, continued by Marshall Billingslea until the 2020 election rendered Mr. Trump a lame duck. Whether and how seriously Mr. Biden’s negotiators address these issues will determine whether a revised New Start agreement has any chance of being approved by the constitutionally required two-thirds Senate majority.<br />New Start has three broad substantive defects: It omits tactical nuclear weapons; it is technologically outdated and doesn’t address developments like hypersonic weapons; and China is not a signatory.</td>

      <td>Responsible leaders made his election possible by creating a vacuum that a demagogue could fill.</td>
      <td>The best argument for Donald Trump’s presidency was never about the man himself. It was about the people who voted for him.<br />It wasn’t really about what he would do for taxes, immigration or the federal judiciary. He did many needed things on those fronts for sure, but any clever Republican politician with a good pollster could have come up with that agenda. It wasn’t about his vaunted business experience and how he might inject a little necessary private-sector sense into a stultified bureaucracy. It certainly wasn’t about his penchant for conversation-dominating social-media expostulations—polls have indicated a consistent popular distaste for them.<br />The best argument for Donald Trump was that he led and gave voice to millions of Americans who had been leaderless and voiceless for decades. The secret people, as a British poet once described his similarly disdained countrymen—smiled at, paid, passed over. The deplorables. The men and women whom the media, entertainment and corporate human resources types never meet in their local Whole Foods but deride as bigots and brutish neanderthals.<br />People who had voted for Republicans and Democrats and had an increasingly hard time telling the difference. People who had voted for a “compassionate conservative,” who led the nation into a catastrophic and futile war. People who had voted for the nation’s first African-American president, a man promising hope and change but delivering hope mostly for those who had plenty of it already and change for few of those who really needed it.<br />These were Americans left behind by, or alarmed by, the unforgiving juggernaut of “progress” hailed by our political, business and cultural leaders as the glorious arc of history.</td>

      <td>Latest setback for mammoth booster adds to challenges for prime contractor Boeing’s space ambitions</td>
      <td>NASA and  Boeing Co.  suffered a potentially major setback in their deep-space ambitions when the engines for a giant new rocket shut down prematurely Saturday during a key test on the ground.<br />The engines were supposed to produce power for eight minutes but shut down after about 60 seconds while fastened to a stand at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. Program officials had said four minutes would be the minimum time to gain confidence in the reliability of the engines, fuel system and surrounding structures.<br />National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said they couldn’t immediately determine the cause of the premature shutdown, and therefore it was too early to determine what fixes would be necessary or even if the test needed to be repeated. They said engineers didn’t know whether it was a hardware, software or sensor malfunction.<br />Boeing is the prime contractor for the mammoth Space Launch System booster, which is more powerful than the Saturn V that blasted Apollo astronauts toward the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was slated for its first uncrewed launch late this year, but that schedule is now in flux. Political and budget pressures on the program, projected to cost a total of between $19 billion and $23 billion to complete, were already increasing.<br />Departing NASA chief James Bridenstine repeatedly said in a news conference that the test shouldn’t be considered a failure, because engineers and program managers gained important data. But he also said, “It’s not everything we hoped it would be.”</td>

Markets adjust to reflect variations in economic performance and generally facilitate adjustments in the global economy.”<br />Ms. Yellen is also expected to say the intentional targeting of exchange rates to gain an unfair advantage in trade is unacceptable.</td>

And while they can teach coping skills, such as emotion regulation, to help deal with the stress, they say it’s also important for people to proactively take steps to be mentally healthy, just as they would if they wanted to be physically fit. “If you wait until a major stressor hits to try and bolster your mental health, it’s like trying to inflate your life raft while you are already drowning at sea,” says Wendy Troxel, a clinical psychologist and senior behavioral and social scientist at Rand Corp.<br />Many people turn to talk therapy, exercise, meditation and a healthy diet to do this. Shirlee Hoffman, a 75-year-old retired marketing consultant in Chicago, limits her news consumption to about five minutes a day. Erin Wiley, 50, a licensed psychotherapist in Toledo, Ohio, uses an app to track the things for which she is grateful.

Michael Schauch, 40, an investment portfolio manager in Squamish, British Columbia, rock climbs—he says the view gives him perspective. Stedman Stevens, 62, the CEO of an aviation technology company in Wilmington, N.C., takes 15 minutes each afternoon to sit alone without distractions. “I listen to what my mind shows me,” he says. “This restores my mental strength.”<br />What steps should you include in your mental-fitness regimen?

His followers, who had congregated at a different airport west of Moscow, were barred from entering the arrival area by dozens of security officials, many in riot gear, who swarmed the area.<br />Mr. Navalny was confronted by law-enforcement officials inside the terminal, who took him away from his wife, lawyer and other supporters traveling with him, video from his YouTube channel showed. Aides said he wasn’t allowed access to a lawyer and was currently at an undisclosed location.<br />Russia’s federal prison service said in a statement that Mr. Navalny, who has been on the agency’s “wanted list” since Dec. 29, was detained for repeated violations of his probation. Further measures would be determined by a court, the agency said. Until then, Mr. Navalny would remain in custody, officials said.<br />The opposition politician has said the legal moves authorities have initiated against him were meant to deter him from returning.</td>

      <td>Phil Spector, a towering figure in the history of 20th-century pop music known for his symphonic “wall of sound” production technique, who later was convicted of second-degree murder, died Saturday at the age of 81.<br />The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed the death in a statement. The official cause of death hasn’t yet been determined. Since 2009, Mr. Spector had been serving a sentence of 19 years to life for the 2003 shooting death of actress Lana Clarkson at his home.<br />A legendary music producer, songwriter and musician, Mr. Spector, known for hits like “Be My Baby” and “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’,” created a lush, regal approach to music production whose extravagant orchestral arrangements and overpowering layers of sound shaped the pop and rock of the 1960s. More than any other producer of his time, Mr. Spector elevated the role of pop music in culture and transformed the recording studio into an instrument—all while capturing the crushes and breakups of teenagers. A kind of early rock star himself, he also cultivated an aura of mystique with his dark sunglasses.<br />In his later years, the reclusive producer’s musical contributions were overshadowed by his volatile behavior, including his abuse of former wife Ronnie Spector and murder of Ms. Clarkson, who was found shot to death in Mr. Spector’s mansion.<br />Born in New York City on Dec. 26, 1939, Mr. Spector formed a band in high school called the Teddy Bears and wrote and recorded the song “To Know Him Is To Love Him”; its title comes from the epitaph on his father’s gravestone. It topped the charts in 1958. After working with famed songwriter-producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, he issued a string of hits in the early to mid-1960s for acts such as the Crystals, the Ronettes and the Righteous Brothers.</td>

The messages show the group repeatedly invoking President Trump’s rhetoric in the weeks leading to the Jan. 6 protest as they built momentum toward what became a violent showdown.<br />Investigators have said they are scrutinizing online messages like these as they attempt to determine the planning and intent of those involved in the attack on the Capitol.<br />The Journal’s review, which included now-deleted posts that have been archived by researchers, suggests the Proud Boys viewed Mr. Trump’s messages as a call to action.</td>

      <td>The Covid crisis both accelerated demands for changes to the economic system and demonstrated that governments can spend freely to help those in trouble when they wish. Will capitalism be changed as a result?<br />To answer the question, it is worth looking back a decade to the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Occupy Wall Street was the protest group du jour, and governments had just allocated trillions of dollars to rescue the financial system. Aside from bank reforms, capitalism (though not global trade) survived pretty much unscathed. This time might be different, because the past decade has prepared the ground for a shift to more interventionist government. The stunning shareholder returns of the past decade hang in the balance.<br />Dominic Barton, then head of management consultants McKinsey & Co. and now Canada’s ambassador to China, summed up the view shared by many of capitalism’s winners in a 2011 article in the Harvard Business Review: “Business leaders today face a choice: We can reform capitalism, or we can let capitalism be reformed for us.”<br />Dozens of think tanks were formed in the 2010s to allow the world’s elite to discuss how to fix capitalism, roping in the pope and Britain’s Prince Charles to speak to corporate leaders. Thousands of environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds were set up, and many old unsuccessful funds had the label slapped on them to make them more attractive.<br />Even the Business Roundtable, the main U.S. corporate lobbying group, signed up for stakeholder capitalism, the idea of paying more attention to the needs of workers, local communities and the environment.</td>

Meanwhile, investment in renewables and other clean energy technologies is taking off, threatening to eat into the market for oil and gas long-term.<br />Though oil prices have notched gains since November, they’re expected to remain below levels that support attractive returns, particularly for an industry still recuperating from last year’s historic drop in fuel demand.<br />As a result, companies aren’t rushing back into drilling. A third of oil producers surveyed by the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter said they planned to raise capital expenditures only slightly this year. About half said they would either keep spending flat or reduce investments.<br />Exxon Mobil Corp.  and  Chevron Corp.  cut plans to invest a combined $260 billion through 2025 to as low as $177 billion.</td>

Instead, she told regional leaders they could conduct smaller, virtual hangouts over Zoom during Wednesday’s ceremonies.<br />Ms. Harris—the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants—will become the first female vice president and the first who is Black and of Indian descent when she takes the oath of office.

As efforts ramp up, here’s advice from doctors involved with the vaccine rollout on how to prepare and what to expect.<br />Many people will register for a timed appointment, aimed at keeping wait times and the potential for crowds to a minimum—although the patchwork rollout so far has also meant many waiting in long lines. After filling out consent forms and receiving the shot, you’ll be monitored for adverse reactions for 15 or 30 minutes depending on your allergy history. In the case of a timed appointment, the entire process should take around an hour, says Julie Boom, co-chair of the Covid-19 Vaccine Task Force at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, which is now vaccinating eligible patients that already have records within the hospital system. Afterward, some people choose to go home and rest.<br />In most cases, you’ll simply need your photo ID and proof of your appointment. Some places may require additional documents, such as employee badges for first responders to show they are eligible. Those getting vaccinated generally shouldn’t be asked to pay, so do ask questions if payment is requested.<br />For now, the two vaccines available in the U.S. are found to be similarly safe and effective, says Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University in New York. Eventually, choosing one vaccine over the other may come down to scheduling conflicts, she says. The second dose of the Pfizer vaccine is offered 21 days later, while Moderna is offered 28 days later. “The only thing I would consider is convenience,” says Dr. El-Sadr.<br />No food precautions are required. Staying well hydrated prior to the vaccine is encouraged for people who tend to feel lightheaded with vaccines or blood draws, says Gregory Huhn, vaccination coordinator for Cook County Health, a hospital system in Chicago.</td>

      <td>Decline in corporate trips and conferences is hitting  whole ecosystems of related commerce</td>
      <td>The coronavirus pandemic delivered a lingering, and possibly permanent, hit to business travel that is likely to weigh on employment and economic growth in some communities for years.<br />Beyond the blows to airlines, hotels, travel agents and rental-car companies, the drop in business travel is rippling through whole ecosystems of related commerce, including airport shops, downtown bars and restaurants, construction firms building convention stages, entertainers, taxi drivers and aircraft-parts manufacturers.<br />Domestic and international business travelers in the U.S. directly spent $334.2 billion in 2019, supporting 2.5 million jobs, according to the U.S. Travel Association. But when considering the follow-on effects, it estimates the economic output and jobs supported by business travel were roughly double those figures before the pandemic.<br />“When a large convention or event is happening, the entire city is involved,” said Tori Emerson Barnes, the association’s head of public affairs and policy. “The florist that provides the flowers, the dry cleaners that prepare the linens, the coffee shop that serves travelers. Whole downtown areas have been revitalized due to the meeting and events business, and they’ve really struggled this past year.”<br />When global restrictions to control the spread of Covid-19 were put into place last spring, businesses and road-warrior workers were forced to adjust, making sales calls and attending board meetings through videoconferences rather than on-site visits, and adapting to virtual training and networking instead of conference-center seminars.</td>

      <td>Part Elena Ferrante, part Patricia Highsmith–themed thriller, ‘Who Is Maud Dixon?’ is set to be one of the buzziest debut novels of the year</td>
      <td>In WSJ. Magazine’s series “12 for ’21,” we highlight a dozen of the most creative artists and entertainers working today—all poised to have a breakout 2021.<br />Sociopathic tendencies aside, Alexandra Andrews relates to a vital piece of Florence Darrow, the Joan Didion fangirl at the heart of her debut novel, Who Is Maud Dixon? “On the face of it, Florence wants to be a writer,” Andrews says. “But what she really wants is significance.”<br />It was a creeping sense of her own insignificance that inspired Andrews, who was coasting along as a copywriter for fashion brands after having already dabbled in investigative journalism and graphic design, to try her hand at writing a novel. “I spent so many years feeling very dissatisfied with where I was in my career,” the 36-year-old author says over Zoom from the Brooklyn home she shares with her husband, the novelist and Harper’s editor Christopher Beha, and their two young children. “I was looking at my peers and how far ahead they were of me and I felt ashamed, and I was asking myself, ‘How did I get here?’ I felt like I’d squandered my good education and I’d taken this wrong turn.”<br />This low-grade envy and anxiety motivated Andrews to write Who Is Maud Dixon?, a witty and suspenseful folie à deux named after the pseudonymous bestselling author who hires Florence to be her research assistant. The story reads like a love letter to Patricia Highsmith’s The Talented Mr. Ripley, with two slightly off-kilter protagonists locking into an increasingly terrifying game of self-erasure and self-invention, backdropped by the glittering Manhattan literary scene and the precipitous cliffs of Morocco. Part publishing-world satire and part thriller, the book will be published in early March by Little, Brown and Company. Translations will steadily roll out across the globe, with rights sold to 22 territories. Universal Pictures has obtained film rights, and there is talk of shooting the adaptation before the end of this year.<br />In his blurb for the thriller, the novelist James Patterson wrote, “By the end of the book you’ll start wondering if author Alexandra Andrews might be a murderer herself.” With her bright, obliging laughter and buttoned-up-to-there oatmeal-colored cardigan, Andrews has the air of a storybook kindergarten teacher. She has managed the unthinkable: to be a big-ticket writer in 2021 with barely a fingerprint on the web. This is partly due to her vanilla name, kryptonite to search-engine optimization. But dig all you like, and you won’t find her obsessively tending to her social media accounts or writing the personal essays that most contemporary authors rely on for procrastination and self-promotion. Andrews, who has a family-centered private Instagram account, recently started a public Instagram account for the purposes of promoting her book. Here she shares pictures of the “Who Is Maud Dixon?” mug that her husband gave her as a gift for Christmas, and a screenshot of an image that pops up after a Google search for Alexandra Andrews, which states that the author of Who Is Maud Dixon? is an actress, married to a man named Billy Andrews. She “even interned at The Paris Review.” Only the last part is true.</td>

The outcry shines a spotlight on the grueling working conditions and hard-edge labor practices that many blue- and white-collar workers face as the internet companies they work for battle over users.<br />Mr. Liu delivered meals through a subcontractor of Alibaba’s Ele.me food-delivery service in the eastern Chinese city of Taizhou, according to the local government. Ele.me said it has paid Mr. Liu’s medical expenses and is continuing to assist him and his family. It also said that Ele.me prohibits agencies it works with from defaulting on paying delivery riders and that it is investigating the case.<br />In recent weeks,  Pinduoduo Inc.,  a fast-growing e-commerce company that now rivals Alibaba by some measures, has also faced criticism after the deaths of two workers in their 20s: One collapsed on her way home from work at 1:30 a.m. and the other jumped from a high-rise.

The country aims to have inoculated 300 million of its 1.3 billion people by August.<br />“This is a huge exercise,” said Mr. Vardhan, who wrote a book about India’s efforts to eradicate polio. “India has tremendous experience in handling these issues.”<br />While some countries have struggled with the scale and complexity of a nationwide vaccine drive, India is confident it can do better because of its experience inoculating its poor populace and maintaining election infrastructure for close to one billion voters.</td>

But the rebound has been unbalanced. It relied heavily on government expenditures and state-sector investments, while private spending remained weak.<br />That is amplifying a trend of declining growth in productivity—or output per worker and unit of capital—in the world’s second-largest economy, according to a new report by the International Monetary Fund. By the measure of average productivity across sectors, a gauge of overall economic efficiency, China’s economy is only 30% as productive as the world’s best-performing economies like the U.S., Japan or Germany, the report shows.<br />This poses a challenge to the leadership’s goal of elevating China into the ranks of rich nations and lifting its living standards.<br />“China has done most of the traditional public investment it can. It’s facing a shrinking labor force. So, where will lasting income growth come from?” said Helge Berger, the IMF’s mission chief for China. “Productivity.”</td>

This latest lockdown follows a similar closure of businesses in the spring, a month-long shutdown lasting most of November and into December and a series of fast-changing restrictions that differ by region based on local infection rates.<br />The on-and-off measures have kept U.K. businesses from being able to make even basic decisions about things like inventory levels, cash flow and employees.<br />“The stop-start nature of these restrictions makes it virtually impossible to plan for, whether on cash flow or strategy,” Mr. Mason said. “There is a sense of resignation now.”<br />Adding another layer of uncertainty: On Dec. 31, the U.K. ended a transition period after breaking from the European Union. Some businesses grappling with lockdowns are simultaneously working through new rules for exports, imports and hiring workers from the EU.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The political fate of President Trump, and any ambitions he might have for reclaiming the White House in 2024, could be settled by who wins a debate over whether a president can be convicted through the impeachment process after leaving office—a matter on which the U.S. Constitution is silent.<br />The House impeached Mr. Trump last Wednesday for “high crimes and misdemeanors” for conduct culminating with a speech exhorting thousands of his followers to march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol and “fight like hell” against congressional certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory.<br />“Thus incited by President Trump, members of the crowd he had addressed…unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress, the Vice President, and Congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts,” the impeachment resolution, which won support from 10 Republicans, alleges.<br />The Senate could take the next steps—trying Mr. Trump and voting on his guilt—as soon as this week. Conviction requires a two-thirds vote by senators present; assuming perfect attendance, 17 Republicans would need to join all 50 Democrats to find Mr. Trump guilty.<br />Many Republicans are gravitating toward a technical argument: The Senate lacks jurisdiction to try him after he leaves office, they maintain, because he will be a private citizen. That could allow the Republicans to thread a political needle, voting against Mr. Trump’s conviction without having to defend his conduct, people familiar with the discussions say.</td>

      <td>MEXICO CITY—The U.S. warned Mexico it had imperiled the sharing of information on the country’s drug cartels by releasing a confidential dossier providing evidence that Mexico’s former defense minister was in the pay of drug kingpins, pushing bilateral antidrug cooperation to its lowest point in years.<br />Mexico’s action “calls into question whether the United States can continue to share information to support Mexico’s own criminal investigations,” the Justice Department said late Friday, adding that the release of the 751-page dossier on Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos was a violation of bilateral treaty obligations on information sharing.<br />The U.S. response comes after Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador accused the Drug Enforcement Administration of fabricating charges against Gen. Cienfuegos, who was exonerated of drug trafficking and bribery by Mexico’s attorney general’s office Thursday. Gen. Cienfuegos was arrested in the U.S. at the request of the DEA last year and then sent back to Mexico following a diplomatic uproar.<br />The Justice Department’s response might mark the lowest point in bilateral cooperation against criminal organizations since the abduction and killing of the DEA agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena by Mexican drug capos in 1985. It comes as Mr. López Obrador’s administration has struggled to contain the rising political and territorial clout of drug cartels and surging criminal violence.<br />“This opens the door to enormous mistrust,” said Raul Benitez, a security analyst at National Autonomous University of Mexico. “If security relations deteriorate and intelligence sharing is limited, the only winners will be drug trafficking cartels.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team is outlining plans to reverse many of President Trump’s policies during the first 10 days of the new administration, including a flurry of executive actions focused on Covid-19, the economy and climate change.<br />Ron Klain, Mr. Biden’s incoming chief of staff, said in a memo released Saturday that the White House would address “four overlapping and compounding crises,” covering the pandemic, the economy, the environment and racial equity.<br />The memo offered the most detailed rundown to date of how Mr. Biden envisions the start of his presidency which Mr. Klain said would be used to “address these four crises, prevent urgent and irreversible harms, and restore America’s place in the world.”<br />The memo makes no mention of Mr. Trump’s second impeachment last week but indicates how the new president will use his executive authority to build momentum even as the Senate may be conducting an impeachment trial during the period.<br />The executive actions cover a range of issues from Mr. Biden’s campaign agenda. The former vice president released a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal, and Mr. Klain said Mr. Biden would soon unveil legislation related to immigration, economic recovery, voting rights and fighting violence against women.</td>

      <td>The ballot could help bolster ties with the Biden administration, but divisions between Fatah and Hamas could yet scuttle the election</td>
      <td>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas announced plans for parliamentary and presidential elections for the first time in about 15 years, as the Palestinians seek to rebuild its ties with President-elect Joe Biden after falling out with the Trump administration.<br />The Palestinians have tried several times to hold elections in the last decade, but each attempt was scuttled by challenges, including sharp divisions between Fatah, the party that largely controls the Palestinian Authority that governs the West Bank, and Hamas, a Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza.<br />Still, the decree issued Friday night by the 85-year-old Mr. Abbas, who is in the 16th year of a four-year term he won in 2005, was the furthest Palestinians have legally come to holding national elections in a decade and a half.<br />The Palestinian leader’s decree set legislative elections for May 22 and presidential elections for July 31. Elections for the Palestinian National Council, which represents Palestinians abroad, were set for Aug. 31.<br />The proposal is part of a broader effort to heal internal schisms within the Palestinian leadership. The issue of Palestinian unity has increased in importance for both Hamas and Fatah following the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, which since last September has seen Israel normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. For decades, the Palestinians have counted on their Arab allies to withhold normalizing relations with Israel until Israel had made peace with them.</td>

      <td><br />Fiat Chrysler  Automobiles NV and Peugeot-maker  PSA Group  cemented their trans-Atlantic merger Saturday, creating Stellantis NV, a global auto-making giant that executives say will have the heft needed to compete in a fast-changing industry.<br />The deal, first agreed to in late 2019 and approved earlier this month by shareholders, comes as the global car business is rapidly shifting to new technologies, such as electric vehicles, and battling upstarts trying to upend everything from the way cars are engineered and built to how they are sold.<br />Stellantis, derived from Latin term meaning “to brighten with stars,” ranks as the world’s third-largest auto maker by sales, according to 2019 figures, the latest available. At Friday’s close, it was worth more than $51 billion. The newly formed car company plans to start trading under the ticker symbol STLA on the Paris and Milan stock exchanges Monday and in New York on Tuesday.<br />Stellantis will have a major presence in North America and more than a quarter of the market in Europe, selling vehicles through a massive collection of brands, ranging from American names like Jeep and Ram to Peugeot, Citroën and Opel in Europe and Maserati and Alfa Romeo on the luxury end.</td>

      <td>KAMPALA, Uganda—President Yoweri Museveni was declared the winner of his sixth consecutive presidential election on Saturday, while opposition leader Bobi Wine alleged the vote was rigged, capping a divisive campaign marred by government repression, an internet shutdown and the country’s worst political violence for decades.<br />Uganda’s Electoral Commission reported that the 76-year-old Mr. Museveni, in power since 1986, had won 59% of the vote, while leading challenger Mr. Wine, the 38-year-old musician turned parliamentarian, won 35%. Ugandan security forces surrounded Mr. Wine’s home Friday, placing him under effective house arrest after he claimed the vote had been falsified. More than a dozen other senior members of his campaign were placed under house arrest on Saturday.<br />Speaking in a telephone interview from his home, Mr. Wine called the result “completely fraudulent” and said he would share evidence of widespread rigging when the internet was switched back on. Asked whether his supporters would take to the streets to demonstrate, he said: “We have all nonviolent and constitutional options on our table, including but not limited to the right to protest.”<br />Mr. Museveni, at his countryside ranch, said the election was “the fairest since independence in 1962.” He thanked Ugandans for giving him another five years in power.<br />Ugandans voted Thursday amid heightened security and an internet shutdown in a vote that the top U.S. diplomat to Africa called “fundamentally flawed.” The hotly contested and violent race pitched Mr. Museveni, one of Africa’s longest-serving leaders, against Mr. Wine, a youthful populist whose message of change galvanized Uganda’s youth. The contest embodies a generational clash across Africa, where entrenched older leaders are grappling with increasingly restless youthful populations demanding improved economic opportunities.</td>

      <td>An influential pro-Trump discussion board active in the buildup to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack faces the prospect of being shut down by its web-hosting company for allegedly fostering white supremacist and violent extremism.<br />Robert Davis, senior vice president of Epik Inc., told The Wall Street Journal his firm warned TheDonald.Win it might be dropped within days if it fails to better cull what he said are discussions glorifying violence, propagating white supremacy and fomenting extremism.<br />“They need to recognize the critical role they play as an inspirational place rather than a hotbed of extremism,” Mr. Davis said. “Epik has no tolerance for anything that incites hate or violence.” If the site didn’t fix the problem speedily, he added, “they’re gone from Epik and it will be hard for them to get service anywhere.”<br />TheDonald.Win has been identified by law enforcement and analysts as an important online staging platform for the storming of the U.S. Capitol that federal prosecutors are investigating as a seditious act and President-Elect Biden characterized as domestic terrorism. Recent posts on the forum viewed by the Journal have included further calls for violence, including a threat to kill House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about which the FBI was informed, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The owner of the domain TheDonald.Win, Jody Williams, said he has been trying for months to purge a surging tide of violent, racist and anti-Semitic postings, an effort he said has triggered multiple daily death threats from censored posters against him and his family. Mr. Williams said a small cluster of the site’s most powerful moderators—including one who controls its code—have thwarted his efforts to rein in such content even as it grew over the last 10 months.</td>

The far-right groups, which don’t accept the legitimacy of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory over President Trump, could become more aggressive in the coming months after security is lowered, the watchdogs and ex-officials said.<br />“They’re not going to go marching up to some building, carrying a flag and using a bullhorn,” a former FBI agent who has worked on domestic terrorism cases said of the most worrisome current threat. “These are people that honestly are intent on doing what it is they’re going to do under the cover of darkness. They’re going to do it in a way that people are not going to see them coming.”<br />Many states are bringing the National Guard to their capitals and bolstering security in unusual measures that are expected to remain in place over Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend through Mr. Biden’s inauguration Wednesday. Capitol police were overwhelmed by the Jan. 6 “stop the steal” protest that turned into a mob invasion of the U.S. Capitol. Federal law-enforcement officials have said they didn’t fully appreciate the risk for violence.</td>

      <td>Increased stimulus spending could play a role in further softening of the U.S. currency</td>
      <td>The view from financial experts abroad is that the dollar, currently near its weakest level in three years, will stay weak, holding on to much of its 2020 decline.<br />The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell more than 6% in 2020, marking its worst performance in three years. That left the dollar hovering near its lowest level since April 2018.<br />Expectations for the dollar have been clouded in recent weeks by political turmoil in Washington, D.C., and a worsening economic outlook. The crisis precipitated by the mob attack on the U.S. Capitol inspired some safe-haven buying of dollars in international markets. Elevated coronavirus-infection levels, despite the rollout of vaccines, meanwhile, threaten to subdue an already faltering economic recovery both in the U.S. and abroad, which also suggests downward pressure on the dollar.<br />At the same time, investors expect that a proposed $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan from President-elect Joe Biden will either weaken the dollar or limit any near-term future appreciation as the infusion of cash to businesses and households increases supply. Such an infusion could lend to dollar appreciation over the medium to long term because it will boost U.S. economic growth relative to other countries, but it is likely to work against the dollar in the short term because of the supply issue.<br />“A currency market isn’t different from any other market,” says William Dinning, chief investment officer of U.K. fund manager Waverton Asset Management. “If there’s a lot of potatoes available, it’s going to be cheaper. If there’s a lot of dollars available, it’s going to be weak.”</td>

      <td>The intelligent, human-like machines long promised by science fiction still don’t exist, but they’ve played an important role in the modern imagination.</td>
      <td>In 2021, robots can be forklifts or machine tools, surgical instruments or bomb defusers. As a viral video showed this month, a new, human-shaped model from Boston Dynamics can even dance to the Motown song “Do You Love Me?” But when the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word “robot” in his play “R.U.R.,” which made its debut in Prague 100 years ago this month, he had something much grander in mind: a new, man-made species, capable of tireless labor but also love, hope and self-sacrifice. As a robot declares in the play’s last scene, “We’ve become beings with souls.”<br />Actual robots may be a letdown by comparison, but over the last century, imaginary robots have become one of our best tools for thinking about fundamental questions: What is it that makes us human? How can we be sure of what’s going on in other minds? Do the benefits of progress outweigh its dangers? These used to be problems for religion and philosophy; thanks to robots, we now often approach them through science fiction.<br />People told stories about mechanical men long before 1921. The Argonautica, a Greek epic from the 3rd century B.C., includes the story of Talos, “fashioned of bronze and invulnerable,” who guards the harbor of Crete. A 16th-century Jewish legend tells of the Golem, a huge man of clay made to protect the Jews of Prague. Both of these proto-robots are built with a kind of kill switch, giving humans a way to keep them in check. Talos is deactivated when the thin skin on his ankle is punctured, allowing the fluid that gives him life to run out; the Golem can be stopped by erasing the Hebrew letter written on his forehead. Clearly, humans have always worried that the machines we make to serve us could eventually turn on us.<br />Not until Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel “Frankenstein,” however, did a man-made creature become an object of sympathy. Dr. Frankenstein makes his monster out of body parts scavenged from “the dissecting room and the slaughterhouse,” and it turns out to be all too human. Indeed, the monster is driven to violence because people refuse to acknowledge that he has human feelings, especially a need for love. “Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?” he rages.<br />It took another century of scientific and industrial progress to prepare the world for robots as we imagine them today—mass-produced intelligent machines that can rival or surpass the human race. In Capek’s play, R.U.R. stands for Rossum’s Universal Robots, the company that manufactures them. Capek credited his brother with coining the word “robot” from the old Czech term robota, the labor service imposed on peasants by feudal kings.</td>

      <td>After a year of startling growth, the tech industry faces a more vexing 2021.<br />The pandemic helped bring the world’s tech giants such as  Amazon.com Inc.  and  Microsoft Corp.  to new heights in 2020. The shift to online shopping and remote working accelerated at a pace that would have been inconceivable without the coronavirus.<br />But there are signs the good times may end soon. Late last year, governments in the U.S., China and Europe separately began investigating whether Big Tech is too big. The scrutiny in Washington is expected to continue under a Biden administration, which also appears inclined to continue the Trump administration’s export restrictions against Chinese companies that are reshuffling global supply chains.<br />While Big Tech faces perhaps its biggest challenge in years, some sectors can look forward to 2021. The world of electric vehicles may finally arrive. President-elect Joe Biden promises to make cybersecurity a priority. And Washington will start doling out financial incentives to help U.S. companies stay ahead of Chinese rivals.<br />Here are some of the tech industry’s most important themes this year.</td>
