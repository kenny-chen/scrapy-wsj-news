      <td>Congress is poised to authorize another round of direct payments to households. There are a few key changes from the spring payments.</td>
      <td>Congress is likely to vote soon to authorize a second round of stimulus payments to households. There are many similarities to the ones that were paid in the spring but also some important differences. Here is what we know about them, though things could change as Congress releases details of the legislation and the government implements the program.<br />When will the second stimulus payments arrive?<br />Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday the first batch of payments could go out at the beginning of next week. That is faster than in the spring, where it took about two weeks after the legislation was signed. The first batches may also be larger than in the spring. That is because the government now has more information about groups that got later payments in the first round, including those who typically don’t file tax returns and those who receive federal benefits. Those who receive paper checks instead of direct deposits will have to wait longer. The bill is written so the IRS makes the payments by Jan. 15, meaning that anyone eligible after that date would likely have to get the money as part of their 2020 tax return.<br />How much are the payments?<br />This time, households will get $600 per adult and $600 per child, down from $1,200 and $500 in the first round. That means a single parent with two children will get $1,800 now after receiving $2,200 in the spring.</td>

      <td>U.S. companies pledged tens of billions of dollars toward racial-equity efforts in 2020. A challenge for 2021 and beyond: tracking where the dollars go and what changes the pledges will bring.<br />Big businesses made commitments of a cumulative $35 billion in the past six months, according to a review of announcements by The Wall Street Journal, in response to a national debate about systemic racism following the killing of George Floyd while being arrested by Minneapolis police on May 25. Companies say the money will go toward boosting the net worth of Black families, creating professional opportunities for minorities and diversifying their own ranks, among other outcomes.<br />The bulk of the $35 billion stems from  JPMorgan Chase  & Co.’s October pledge to invest $30 billion over the next five years into such efforts as financing affordable housing and opening branches in neighborhoods where financial services are scarce.<br />Major banks are behind some of the other biggest pledges, including $1 billion from  Bank of America Corp.  and $1.15 billion by  Citigroup Inc.  to provide capital to Black business owners and home buyers, among other measures.<br />Elsewhere,  Walmart Inc.  has pledged to found a center for racial equity, through which it will donate $100 million to nonprofit groups over five years.  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google is putting $175 million into supporting Black business owners, startup founders, job seekers and developers, in addition to a $100 million YouTube fund for Black artists and creators.</td>

      <td>The media’s politicization of Covid has proved deadly and puts Americans’ freedoms at risk.</td>
      <td>America has been paralyzed by death and fear for nearly a year, and the politicization of the pandemic has made things worse by adding misinformation and vitriol to the mix. With vaccines finally being administered, we should be entering a joyous phase. Instead we endure still more inflammatory rhetoric and media distortion.<br />Americans need to understand three realities. First, all 50 states independently directed and implemented their own pandemic policies. In every case, governors and local officials were responsible for on-the-ground choices—every business limit, school closing, shelter-in-place order and mask requirement. No policy on any of these issues was set by the federal government, except those involving federal property and employees.<br />Second, nearly all states used the same draconian policies that people now insist on hardening, even though the number of positive cases increased while people’s movements were constrained, business activities were strictly limited, and schools were closed. Governors in all but a few states—Florida and South Dakota are notable exceptions—imposed curfews, quarantines, directives on group gatherings, and mask mandates.<br />Mobility tracking verifies that people restricted their movement. Gallup and YouGov data show that 80% to 90% of Americans have been wearing masks since early August. Lockdown policies had baleful effects on local economies, families and children, and the virus spread anyway. If one advocates more lockdowns because of bad outcomes so far, why don’t the results of those lockdowns matter?<br />Third, the federal government’s role in the pandemic has been grossly mischaracterized by the media and their Democratic allies. That distortion has obscured several significant successes, while undermining the confidence of ordinary Americans. Federal financial support and directives enabled the development of a massive, state-of-the-art testing capacity and produced billions of dollars of personal protective equipment. Federal agencies met all requests for supplemental medical personnel and hospital-bed capacity. Officials in the Health and Human Services Department have told me there are no unmet requests for extra resources.</td>

      <td>Cotton Mather deplored ‘masking’ but otherwise sounds a lot like 2020’s coronavirus commissars.</td>
      <td>It will be a puritan sort of Christmas for most of us this year: confined to our homes, maintaining a distance from each other, avoiding public revelry on penalty of a hefty fine. If you do go to church, remember—no singing, by order of the elders. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is not the first flamboyantly coiffed authoritarian governor-protector in history to ban the singing of Christmas carols. But at least Oliver Cromwell never went near a French laundry, as far as we know.<br />“The feast of Christ’s nativity is spent in reveling, dicing, carding, masking, and in all licentious liberty . . . by mad mirth, by long eating, by hard drinking, by lewd gaming, by rude reveling!” Cotton Mather declaimed from his pulpit in 1712, denouncing the traditional Christmas celebrations of the time.<br />I can’t speak to the lewd gaming anyone may have been planning this year, but other than the “masking”—which, in an odd inversion of the rules of officially approved behavior is now mandatory rather than proscribed—Mather’s early 18th-century injunctions are pretty much in place in the 21st. That’s progressivism for you.<br />The prospect of a good old Cotton Mather Yuletide is a fitting end to a year in which the puritanical tendency has again entrenched itself as the dominant force in American politics.<br />The modern left’s mission to extirpate sin from society is the product of a secular religion of the most austere sort.</td>

      <td>New studies point to the trillions of organisms in the human microbiome as playing an unexpectedly huge role in our well-being</td>
      <td><br />Scientists are exploring evidence that major depression may in part be a gut feeling, orchestrated by the microbiome—trillions of microorganisms living in and around our bodies, which influence our health and well-being.<br />In a series of studies, researchers are discovering that the microbial menagerie living in our digestive tract may help regulate brain function, including mental health. Recent findings by scientists in the U.S., Europe and China are linking our feelings of stress, anxiety and severe depression to disturbances among hundreds of microbe species living in our gut that some researchers have started calling the psychobiome.<br />Conversely, other bacteria in the gut appear to produce some of the same substances used by doctors to treat depression and may naturally play a role in maintaining our emotional balance.<br />“The feeling of malaise, if you will, is often associated with gastrointestinal disorders,” said microbiologist Jack Gilbert at the University of California, San Diego and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who helped pioneer the study of the human gut microbiome. It is “chemically altering nerve signals going into the brain, which alter brain chemistry and therefore behavior, mood and, we believe, depression and anxiety.”</td>

      <td>European Medicines Agency recommends authorization for the shot, clearing way for formal approval this week</td>
      <td>BRUSSELS—The Covid-19 vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and its German partner  BioNTech SE  was cleared for use by the European Union’s drug agency, a major step in efforts to tame the disease in a region that is fighting a deadly winter surge, as the bloc also tries to keep out a new mutation in the coronavirus found in Britain.<br />The European Medicines Agency said that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine—which was developed in Germany—is safe and effective against Covid-19, paving the way for EU authorities to formally authorize the use of the shot this week. Distribution could begin next week, following administrative procedures needed to coordinate a rollout across 27 member states.<br />The EU is also grappling with concerns over the spread of a new variant of the coronavirus in the U.K. that has prompted many countries to ban passenger flights from that country in an effort to prevent entry of the mutation, which the British government says is more infectious.<br />The decision to recommend authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine comes after the U.K. and the U.S. approved it in early December. Some EU leaders expressed anger at the bloc’s slower pace, in light of the thousands of Europeans dying of the disease each day. The agency moved up the timing of its decision by a week.<br />U.S. regulators on Friday also permitted use of Moderna, Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine, with the first immunizations expected Monday.</td>

      <td>Companies plan to encourage, incentivize vaccination; ‘Here is the carrot, and here is the stick’</td>
      <td>Some of America’s largest businesses say they will encourage—but not mandate—employees to get Covid-19 vaccines, using a mix of incentives and consequences to ensure as many workers as possible are inoculated.<br />Facebook Inc.,   Marriott International Inc.,  and  Discover Financial Services  are among big employers saying they will urge vaccinations and highlight the benefits of doing so but stop short of requiring them. Covid-19 vaccines are likely to be available to anyone in the U.S. who wants one by the end of the second quarter, federal officials said this week.<br />Some employers plan to provide 401(k) or other cash incentives to staff, as they do to encourage use of other wellness benefits, or bar unvaccinated employees from certain activities. Several executives have said they would offer their corporate facilities to public-health officials as vaccine administration sites in making shots convenient for workers.<br />The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last week released guidance noting that employers can generally require their workers to get vaccinated and may ask employees for proof that they have done so. Employers are bound to accommodate employees who object because of religious beliefs or because they have a medical condition that makes it unsafe for them to get a vaccine.<br />Human-resources leaders and chief executives say they aren’t mandating vaccinations because they want to respect the views of those who lack confidence in the new vaccines, avoid liability if there are adverse reactions and not infringe on religious or personal beliefs. The approach is similar to how large companies often handle seasonal flu shots, though this vaccine targets a novel virus that shut down many workplaces across the country, corporate medical advisers say.</td>

      <td>Royal Dutch  Shell  PLC said it would write down the value of its assets by up to $4.5 billion and warned of another set of poor earnings for the fourth quarter, showing how the oil-and-gas industry continues to struggle amid the fallout of the pandemic.<br />The energy giant said Monday its oil-and-gas production business would likely report a third consecutive loss in the last three months of the year, and that results from its trading operations—a bright spot earlier in the pandemic amid volatile oil prices—would be below average.<br />Shell’s update is the first indication of another tough quarter for the oil-and-gas sector, which continues to grapple with lower demand as Covid-19 lockdowns hit economies hard and halt travel around the world.<br />The downbeat trading update, issued ahead of fourth-quarter earnings due in February, comes despite a recovery in oil prices in recent weeks after vaccines to fight the virus were approved in some countries. Benchmark Brent oil has stabilized and reversed some losses, gaining almost 20% in the past three months to trade at around $50 a barrel, having briefly traded below $20 a barrel in April.<br />However, while Shell noted improved refining and chemical margins compared with the previous quarter, the rising oil price doesn’t appear to have been enough to turnaround the company’s fortunes.</td>

He was happy to recommend talented Black job candidates when asked.<br />“But as I followed up with those same people months later, asking, ‘Did you make that hire?,’ in almost every single instance, they say, ‘Oh, it’s been so busy…’ Meaning, in a word, no.”<br />Offices across the country responded to this summer’s racial-justice protests after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Memorial Day with an unprecedented wave of diversity and antiracism training. Half a year later, workers of color are taking stock of the results.<br />It’s a mixed bag. It’s clear by now that corporate diversity efforts require substantial follow-up, both in terms of interpersonal dynamics and in translating rhetoric into concrete policies. Not all workplaces are up to the challenge.</td>

      <td>Another spending blowout, but at least it has limits on the Fed.</td>
      <td>Congress is close to agreement on another trillion-dollar Covid-19 relief bill, but please don’t call this economic stimulus. With some exceptions, the main relief here is for the politicians who want to take credit for doling out more cash to constituents.<br />The best provision in the bill is the limit on potential abuse by the Biden Treasury and Federal Reserve. Credit here to Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, who held firm on limiting the Fed’s maneuvering room without a new act of Congress. Democrats are claiming victory, but that’s face-saving spin.<br />The bill will repurpose the $429 billion in Cares Act emergency funding that the Fed hasn’t had to use. It also includes language barring the Fed from restarting the facilities that are set to expire on Dec. 31 or creating clones. That’s important because the wailing over this language proves that Democrats want to use the Fed to bail out state and local governments. They said so in the House Heroes Act by demanding 10-year, 25-basis-point Fed loans.<br />Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his media echoes targeted Mr. Toomey as their villain du jour, as if financial markets are still in a crisis. They also claimed Mr. Toomey wanted to rewrite the law governing 13(3) Fed facilities, but that is false. His aim is to make sure that emergency facilities don’t become open-ended fiscal programs. Bigger companies now have ample access to private credit, and small businesses are getting more direct aid.<br />Readers may recall that last March Democrats were calling the money for Fed pandemic facilities a “slush fund” for Donald Trump. “Trump wants our response to be a half-trillion dollar slush fund to boost favored companies and corporate executives,” Elizabeth Warren tweeted. Joe Biden slammed the Fed programs as a “$500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions.” The Trump Treasury used the money responsibly.</td>

Instead he’s calling Members of Congress and asking them to object on the House and Senate floor to the results of the Electoral College count.<br />This won’t change the outcome, but it will put pressure on Republicans to embarrass themselves by indulging Mr. Trump’s attempts to delegitimize the results. We hope the Members ignore his pleas.<br />Meanwhile, after days of silence over the hack on U.S. government agencies and private companies, Mr. Trump chimed in Saturday to add confusion. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday that the evidence clearly points to the Russians for the hack.<br />But Mr. Trump tweeted that “Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream [media] is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of . . . discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!).” Then he linked the hack to a possible “hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA.”</td>

      <td>Rhode Island allows more charter schools after union failures.</td>
      <td>A report last year found abject student performance, demoralized teachers and deteriorating buildings in Providence, Rhode Island’s traditional public schools. Well, this particular hell may have frozen over, as last week the state’s education council voted to expand and open more charter schools to rescue students in the district.<br />About 13% of Providence’s 30,000 students attend 28 charter schools, some in other districts. But demand far exceeds supply. Only 18% of the 5,000 or so charter school applicants were offered a seat this school year, according to the state education department. Eighty-four percent of Providence students are low-income and 92% are minorities.<br />The state education council last week gave preliminary approval for more than 5,700 new charter seats in Providence and other districts. Three of four new charters that applied got a green-light to open, pending final approval in the spring, and three existing charters (two of which serve Providence) are expanding. “Parents of color don’t have a lot of choice and resources,” said Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green, who pushed the expansion. “We should not be closing opportunities.”<br />The teachers union isn’t happy. In a letter to Gov. Gina Raimondo, three union leaders including American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten complained that the expansion would “financially destabilize the Providence school district, because it would drain money from neighborhood public schools.”<br />This is the usual rhetorical union trick. Charters are public schools, albeit without the barnacles and costs of union control. Funding for charter schools in Rhode Island follows the student, though local districts retain a portion for fixed costs when students leave for a charter. The state took over the Providence school district, including the budget, last year after the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy exposed the school horror show in a study.</td>

      <td>Strapped hospitals are struggling to set up infusion sites. But states and the feds can help.</td>
      <td>The Friday approval of a second Covid vaccine is welcome news, but much of the public won’t be able to get inoculated for many months. Meanwhile, the best way to reduce suffering and hardship is therapeutic technologies like antibody drugs. But right now, many of these drugs are languishing on shelves at hospitals and not reaching patients.<br />Moncef Slaoui, who runs Operation Warp Speed, said recently that more than 80% of the available supply is sitting unused, even as hospitals are inundated with critically ill patients. Antibody drugs infuse patients with synthetic versions of the kinds of immune cells developed in response to an infection. Early trials show antibody cocktails can stop Covid symptoms from progressing. They can be used with or without vaccines for patients at highest risk of severe disease.<br />The supply is limited. The two companies with authorized versions, Eli Lily and Regeneron, will ship a little more than one million doses by the end of the year. Evidence suggests that for every 10 high-risk patients treated, one hospitalization might be avoided. That may sound modest, but it adds up: a million doses administered could translate into 100,000 fewer hospitalizations. Such a reprieve would help hospitals keep up with the current surge.<br />The biggest difficulty is logistical. Patients need to be referred for antibodies soon after diagnosis. The infusion takes several hours to prepare, deliver and monitor. A specialized nurse must supervise, with protective equipment, in a space separate from other patients to minimize spread.<br />Most early doses have been going to hospitals. But many hospitals are strapped by Covid and having a hard time setting up dedicated space and redirecting trained nursing and support staff. The government should send more antibodies to community infusion centers and clinics that have taken steps to administer doses. These clinics can work with testing sites to speed referrals.</td>

      <td>Many civilian lives could be saved by using tourniquets.</td>
      <td>Robyn Gardner lay bleeding by a river near Sacramento, Calif., her thigh ripped open by a boat’s propeller. A former Army medic happened to be nearby. He applied a tourniquet, which immediately stopped the bleeding and stabilized Gardner. But when the ambulance arrived, the crew removed the tourniquet, because tourniquets weren’t an approved trauma intervention in the jurisdiction. EMTs tried other techniques to control the bleeding, but Gardner died at 38 in 2003.<br />Tourniquets save lives, but an exaggerated fear of tissue damage led medical authorities to ban them from use on both military and civilian trauma patients. Some 3,400 American lives were lost in Vietnam from failure to use these simple devices.<br />That realization prompted a four-year review of battlefield trauma care, which led to the development of Tactical Combat Casualty Care, first described in 1996. TCCC recommends tourniquets for life-threatening extremity bleeding until the casualty reaches a surgeon. But most U.S. military units ignored the advice at first and didn’t carry tourniquets into Afghanistan and Iraq.<br />That changed as casualties mounted. In 2005 the U.S. Special Operations Command and the U.S. Central Command both mandated tourniquet use. Studies since have found hundreds of American lives have been saved on the battlefield with tourniquets and little danger of tissue damage.<br />Civilian trauma care has always benefited from military wartime experience, but the process can be slow. By 2010 tourniquets were routine in the military but rare outside it. Civilian tourniquet use increased significantly after 2013, when Hartford, Conn., trauma surgeon Lenworth Jacobs convened a group of experts to study ways of saving lives in civilian mass casualty incidents such as the Sandy Hook school shooting. The Hartford Consensus led the American College of Surgeons and the American College of Emergency Physicians to endorse tourniquet use by professional first responders.</td>

      <td>Children under 10 can’t be expected to stare at a computer for hours.</td>
      <td>Online learning is especially difficult for young children, and schools are blaming parents. A woman came to see me because her 8-year-old daughter’s school recommended neuropsychological evaluation. Each day the girl was expected to sit in a chair, stare at a computer for hours, listen, memorize and repeat. Not surprisingly, she had trouble staying engaged, often got up and moved around, and was distracted when the teacher called on her. She had no learning or attention problems before Covid-19 and her reactions were perfectly normal. The problem was the school’s unrealistic expectations.<br />The pandemic and the shift to online learning seem to be intensifying the trend toward pathologizing ordinary childhood behavior. Diagnosing a child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder isn’t straightforward. It can be challenging to determine if the child’s behavior indicates a neurodevelopmental disorder or a natural response to a stressful and stifling environment. The prevalence of ADHD diagnoses among U.S. children and adolescents rose from 6.1% in 1997-98 to 10.2% in 2015-16 among U.S. children and adolescents. A 2015 study found a correlation between rates of ADHD diagnosis and laws penalizing school districts when students fail, suggesting that diagnostic rates can be influenced by policy.<br />Covid-19 shutdowns complicate the matter further. Teachers and administrators expect to be able to teach young children in the same way they did when they were face to face. But children under 10 have a hard time learning remotely, even if they clearly don’t have ADHD—and the younger the child, the more difficult the task. Young children are filled with exploratory energy, and need outlets for play and creativity.<br />That said, it is exciting to watch as education-technology entrepreneurs work to find solutions to this school failure. New online tutoring companies for young children use more creative and experiential methods of teaching, don’t expect children to stay online for long and have realistic expectations for what kids can learn in the online format. “Our children are feeling unheard and unseen, with a thoughtful, hands-on, playful and experiential approach remote learning can be successful for even the youngest of learners,” said Mary Cantwell, a co-founder of EnrichedNYC. “But the schools are not implementing such an approach. ”<br />As the second half of the school year begins, parents and teachers must accept that distraction and disengagement during online learning are normal, not pathological. Children are feeling frustrated and need compassion rather than judgment, criticism and impatience from the adults in their lives. For most, 2020-21 won’t be a year of great academic achievement. But it could be a year of strengthening relationships with family members, building resilience and emotional maturity, and learning to cope with the disappointment and adversity of missing friends and activities. The most important lessons for everyone this year will be learned outside the classroom.</td>

The first “Wonder Woman” grossed $103.3 million in the U.S. and Canada during its opening weekend in 2017.<br />While some theaters in the U.S. have managed to reopen at limited capacity during the pandemic, others, including those in large metropolitan markets like New York City and Los Angeles, have remained closed because of lockdowns as the pandemic thwarts consumers’ ability to return to public spaces. Media measurement company Comscore estimates only about a third of North America’s theaters are open.<br />Abroad, the economies of key international box-office markets like the U.K., Brazil and Mexico are also under severe strain as many people choose to stay home. Over the weekend, the U.K. initiated more lockdowns in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, even as the nation recently began distributing a vaccine.<br />“Wonder Woman 1984” stars Gal Gadot as the titular character and is directed by Patty Jenkins. Immersed in the glitz and excess of 1980s America, the Amazonian warrior turned superhero is tasked with battling villains amid efforts to save the world. Buoyed by the on-screen chemistry between Ms. Gadot and co-star Chris Pine, the movie has received generally positive reviews, including a critics score exceeding 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, despite many grumbling about a two-and-half-hour run time.</td>

The findings stem from the broadest review of agency enforcement efforts conducted in the wake of two fatal crashes of  Boeing Co. ’s 737 MAX jets.<br />Concluding that systemic FAA deficiencies pose an “unnecessary risk to the flying public,” the report cited a pattern of agency managers avoiding responsibility for failures to ensure proper staff training. Managers also undermined or overruled enforcement decisions of some inspectors, investigators determined.<br />“When inspectors pushed back,” according to the report, “they were investigated and in some cases reassigned.”<br />After examining some 13,000 pages of documents and interviewing dozens of agency employees, investigators described a “failed FAA safety management culture” tending to favor companies over FAA staff and “often accompanied by retaliation against those who report safety violations.”</td>

The Nov. 2 meeting took place a few days before Ant was supposed to go public, in what would have been the world’s biggest initial public offering.<br />Mr. Ma had angered Beijing by lashing out in a speech in October at President Xi Jinping’s signature campaign to control financial risks, saying it stifled innovation. Now, the regulators had called the meeting to voice their concerns about Ant’s business model.<br />His olive-branch offer at the meeting failed at saving the IPO and Beijing has since stepped up efforts to rein in China’s Big Tech giants.</td>

      <td>I voted to exempt Jim Mattis from the law but won’t repeat that mistake with Lloyd Austin.</td>
      <td>On Jan. 13, 2017, I voted to allow retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis to serve as secretary of defense. Like every Marine of my generation, I looked up to Gen. Mattis as the embodiment of the Marine Corps ethos. I still do. But I have come to believe that my vote was a mistake. Congress was wrong to exempt him from a legal prohibition on recently retired military officers serving as defense secretary. And Congress shouldn’t do the same for President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee, retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austin.<br />Before Secretary Mattis, Congress had allowed only one exemption since passing the 1947 National Security Act, for Army Gen. George Marshall in 1950. Voting to allow a second exception didn’t seem like much of a threat to civil-military relations. Yet with the benefit of hindsight, I can see how Gen. Mattis’s tenure departed from norms in important ways. Despite my enormous respect for him and the exceptional National Defense Strategy he wrote at the Pentagon, his time as secretary reinforced why recently retired officers shouldn’t serve in this role.<br />Like many military officers, Secretary Mattis never seemed interested in the cabinet politics that come with the position. He avoided fights with fiscal hawks in the White House over defense spending, even as defense hawks in Congress begged him to make the case for additional dollars.<br />Secretary Mattis seemed to run the Pentagon like it was a combatant command. After hundreds of billions in defense cuts under the Obama administration, he rightly made a priority of improving readiness. But that came at the expense of long-term overhaul, despite bipartisan support for efforts like growing the Navy to 355 ships.<br />Additionally, Gen. Mattis brought a warfighting-first perspective to public relations. With no background in politics, he undervalued the importance of engaging the public on national-security issues and scaled back the department’s public release of information. This had the perverse effect of reducing the department’s ability to persuade Congress and the public in important bureaucratic fights.</td>

      <td>The U.S. must respond proportionally to the SolarWinds breach—and prepare for the next attack.</td>
      <td>The  SolarWinds  breach could be the most significant cyber incident in American history. Russian intelligence—likely the SVR, the foreign-intelligence branch—infiltrated and sat undetected on U.S. government networks for nearly 10 months. It was a sophisticated, smart and savvy attack that should alarm the public and private sectors.<br />We may not know the full extent of the damage for some time. Don’t be surprised if more government entities disclose that they too were victims of this attack. Don’t be surprised either if it emerges that private companies were hit. SolarWinds says it has more than 300,000 customers, including 400 companies in the Fortune 500. That’s a lot of potential victims.<br />It appears that this was purely an intelligence-gathering effort. The SVR sat on government networks collecting as much data as it could, whenever and however it wanted. It was less like tapping into phone lines and more like breaking into the library and wandering around.<br />Every country conducts espionage. That’s not the alarming part. What is truly scary is that the Russians are inside the house now. Who knows where they’ve planted malware, corrupted or deleted data, locked users out of systems, or destroyed systems entirely? Turning off the system and uninstalling SolarWinds software isn’t enough. It may take years and thousands of hours to unpack fully where the Russians hid themselves and their code.<br />Using a network-management company’s supply chain of updates to penetrate targeted networks is exceptionally smart. This tactic will spawn imitators, and not only among governments. Tools and techniques used by state actors quickly end up in the hands of criminals, especially when they work. Look how ransomware spread a few years ago.</td>

If the response is “Merry Christmas” right back, those who exchange the wishes likely are kindred spirits. Awkward moments with some nonbelievers or people with other religious beliefs tend to be brief and manageable. No harm, no foul.<br />Stephen Ford encourages us to go with “Happy Holidays” as a noncombative wish that reflects quiet Christian confidence (“‘Happy Holidays’ Is Pro-Christmas,” Houses of Worship, Dec. 11).

But releasing government-sponsored enterprises  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  from conservatorship with little capital and no reforms is no solution at all. It would undermine investor confidence, create volatility in the mortgage market and impede access to credit for consumers. Why upend the mortgage market at a time when it is one of the few economic bright spots?  Moody’s  recently wrote that an exit from conservatorship without a government guarantee could result in a downgrade in the GSEs’ debt ratings.<br />The Mortgage Bankers Association doesn’t support an endless conservatorship; we believe the Treasury Department should work with the Federal Housing Finance Agency to implement reforms so that Fannie and Freddie can eventually operate outside of government control. These reforms include equal secondary market access for all lenders regardless of size, business model, or volume of loans delivered to the GSEs; strict limits on the size and use of the GSEs’ mortgage investment portfolios; and the promotion of credit-risk transfers to protect taxpayers.<br />Bob Broeksmit<br />President & CEO<br />Mortgage Bankers Association</td>

Fair enough. But how many of the president’s detractors believed that the Steele dossier was true and President Trump assumed office illegitimately?

Yet by the time it reaches your door, it costs $18.91. Here’s the breakdown of nearly $10 in added charges:<br /><br />During the pandemic, people have been willing to pay the delivery upcharge as a way to exercise caution while procuring meals and groceries. Following the first round of shelter-in-place orders, suburbs drove the first profitable quarter for  DoorDash Inc.,  which owns Caviar. In April, Instacart Inc. experienced a 500% year-over-year increase in grocery orders. The company’s contractor shoppers became front-line workers overnight.<br />As states renew restrictions on indoor dining and extend stay-at-home orders across the country, delivery is top of mind once again. But consumers are growing wary of the inflated cost of delivery, and companies are offering users better deals, in exchange for loyalty. What is the best way to save money? Pay attention to the details.<br />Fees aren’t the only source of extra costs. The prices of individual items can be padded too.  Costco ,  for instance, doesn’t require its Instacart grocery-delivery customers to hold a $60-a-year membership the way in-store shoppers must, but it does charge higher prices on Instacart than in its warehouse, on top of surcharges.</td>

Now, with infections and deaths are surging again and as governments reimpose or weigh reimposing restrictions, economists are again marking down forecasts—though not as drastically as earlier this year.<br />The pandemic was a “very, very uncertain situation” and forecasters’ swing to very pessimistic and back is “understandable behavior and good, because otherwise they’re not really calling it as they see it,” said Prakash Loungani, an economist at the International Monetary Fund who has written about economists’ tendency to miss the magnitude of recessions. “From my perspective, forecasters have actually done a good job this year relative to their past performance.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Some senior Defense Department officials are pressing to formally separate the leadership of the National Security Agency from U.S. Cyber Command, in an apparent effort to weaken the military’s control of its top electronic spy agency, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The proposal to split control of the two agencies before the end of the Trump administration and install a civilian atop the NSA is already facing resistance from lawmakers in Congress. It also isn’t clear how the separation could legally occur without the administration proving to Congress that certain conditions required under the law have been met, the people said.<br />The move, which has been considered by officials in years past, is controversial because it could lead to the politicization of intelligence produced by the NSA, one of the primary feeders of highly sensitive information to the nation’s military. It also would amount to a sweeping bureaucratic restructuring of intelligence and cybersecurity agencies amid a change in administrations.<br />The plan under consideration was circulated among Pentagon officials in recent days, according to a U.S. official and another person familiar with the matter. It is supported by Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, who was installed at the Pentagon in early November. The plan appears to be a dusted-off version of one that was first floated inside the Pentagon by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, according to another U.S. official. “This is very preliminary,” the official said, adding that a meeting was scheduled for this coming week to discuss the proposal.</td>

Though it spreads more easily from person to person, there is no evidence it is any more deadly or resistant to vaccines, he said.<br />The new lockdown means many families won’t be allowed to gather for Christmas. Mr. Johnson, who only days ago noted it would be “inhuman” to put curbs on Christmas celebration, said: “It is with a very heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned.”<br />The new restrictions cover the capital, as well as much of southeastern and eastern England. In London, the new strain of the virus accounted for 62% of the new cases identified in the week through Wednesday.<br />Similar steps have been taken across Europe to beat back rising caseloads. In Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced Friday a total lockdown across the country for the first time since May to be in force over Christmas, from Dec. 24 until Jan. 6.</td>

      <td>Modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel is now under the authority of three investigating magistrates</td>
      <td>PARIS—French officials have brought preliminary charges, including raping minors, against an associate of the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.<br />French prosecutors alleged Saturday that modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel raped minors over the age of 15 and committed acts of sexual harassment. Mr. Brunel is also being questioned, though not charged, on suspicion of child sex trafficking, prosecutors said. He will remain in custody pending further investigation, the prosecutors added.<br />A lawyer for Mr. Brunel, Corinne Dreyfus-Schmidt, didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />Preliminary charges are an important step in the French judicial process that indicates authorities are deepening an investigation. Mr. Brunel is now under the authority of three investigating magistrates, who will work with police to gather evidence to determine whether—and on what formal charges—Mr. Brunel should stand trial.<br />Mr. Brunel was detained this week as he attempted to board a flight to Senegal from Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport, part of a nearly year-and-a-half investigation into allegations of underage rape and sex trafficking committed in France or against French people by Epstein and his accomplices, prosecutors said.</td>

      <td>In many times and places, the joyful holiday has been a time for melancholy reflections and ghostly visitations.</td>
      <td>In this pandemic year, many of us will be celebrating Christmas under the shadow of grief and uncertainty. But Christmas, like the pagan winter festivals that preceded it, has always carried more than a hint of darkness. The joyous celebration of the birth of the Christian savior has often been an occasion for melancholy and nostalgia, particularly when families are separated by war or other tragic events.<br />In November 1863, during the Civil War, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s son Charles was seriously wounded in battle. A few weeks later on Christmas, Longfellow wrote “I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,” reflecting on how the carnage “mocks” the holiday’s promise of “peace on earth, good-will to men.” In 1943, Bing Crosby’s recording of the song “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” spoke to millions of soldiers and their families who couldn’t celebrate the holiday together: “I’ll be home for Christmas/If only in my dreams.” And in 1967, as war raged in Vietnam, Stevie Wonder’s “Someday at Christmas” looked forward, like Longfellow’s poem, to a happier future: “Someday at Christmas there’ll be no wars/When we have learned what Christmas is for.”<br />Christmas melancholy often takes a ghostly form. In the 19th century, telling ghost stories on Christmas Eve was popular in Britain and North America, a tradition that inspired many writers to create their own. The narrator of Henry James’s psychological horror story “The Turn of the Screw” calls it “gruesome, as, on Christmas Eve in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be.” Charles Dickens wrote a series of ghost stories published yearly at Christmas. “A Christmas Carol” is the most famous, but there were many others, including “The Signalman,” in which a railway worker receives spectral warnings of impending accidents. In the 20th century, continuing the tradition, Christmas has been a popular setting for horror movies, such as “Black Christmas” (1974) and “Krampus” (2015), which draws on German folklore about a demonic anti-Santa Claus who eats naughty children.<br />Many cultures have similar traditions about a Christmas visitor who punishes bad children, rather than bringing presents to good ones. In France, Père Fouettard (“Father Whipper”) is said to beat badly behaved children with a whip. On Christmas Eve in South Africa, homes may be haunted by Danny, a boy who was beaten to death by his grandmother for eating cookies left out for Santa.<br />Italy’s La Befana is more sad than scary. When the Christ child was born, she was invited by the three Magi to join them on the journey to Bethlehem, but she declined because she was too busy tending her house. She soon regretted her decision and went out to look for the wise men, but they were already gone. Ever since, on the Feast of the Epiphany—the holiday in early January that commemorates the visit of the Magi—she travels the world in search of the infant Jesus, leaving gifts for children wherever she stops.</td>

      <td>In Personal Board of Directors, top business leaders talk about the people they turn to for advice, and how those people have shaped their perspective and helped them succeed. Previous installments from the series are here.<br />Jacqueline Novogratz has spent her career learning how to help others. The best place to start, she says, is listening.<br />“When you’re an outsider or coming from a place of privilege, it’s really easy to think you have the answers,” Ms. Novogratz says. “The first job you have is listening.”<br />Ms. Novogratz is the founder and chief executive of Acumen, a nonprofit global venture capital fund. But she began her career as an “accidental banker” in her early 20s. After first interviewing for the role to appease her parents, her job at Chase Manhattan Bank would take her abroad to 40 countries, where she witnessed troubled economies firsthand.<br />She went on to co-found Duterimbere, a microfinance institution in Rwanda, and work for the Rockefeller Foundation before starting Acumen. The firm invests in startups that are tackling problems faced by low-income communities around the world, providing seed money to companies such as PEG Africa, which provides solar home systems on credit to off-grid households across West Africa.</td>
