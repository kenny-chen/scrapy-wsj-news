      <td>Hollywood stages a glitzy comeback; the awards ceremony was held at a working transit hub</td>
      <td>“Nomadland” won the award for best picture Sunday at the 93rd Academy Awards, where Hollywood tried to make a case for the power of movies and turn a corner after 14 months of existential crisis for the industry.<br />“Please watch our movie on the largest screen possible,” said Frances McDormand, a producer of “Nomadland” and its star, in her acceptance speech, urging viewers to return to movie theaters “shoulder to shoulder in that dark space.”<br />With its vistas of the American West, “Nomadland” was a counterpoint to the cooped-up reality for many viewers in pandemic, and offered a somber tale of resilience, with a character learning to live on society’s margins, played by Ms. McDormand, who also won the Oscar for best actress.<br /><br />The film’s director, Chloé Zhao, became only the second woman (after Kathryn Bigelow) to win the Academy Award for best director. The Beijing-born Ms. Zhao is also the first Asian woman to win that award.</td>

      <td>China has been making steady if slow progress on reducing coal as a percentage of its energy mix</td>
      <td>Last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping committed to reducing his country’s coal consumption beginning in 2026. That is later than many climate change activists had hoped, but it will still be a challenge for the world’s largest coal consumer.<br />One thing that might help—while also smoothing over relations with Uncle Sam—would be more cooperation on natural gas development and trade.<br />China has been making steady if slow progress on reducing coal as a percentage of its energy mix: 56.8% of energy consumed in China came from coal last year, down from 69.2% in 2010. Despite an enormous renewable power investment binge in 2020, unleashed as part of the nation’s stimulus efforts, thermal coal power has also proved stubbornly resilient. In March, Chinese thermal power output rose 25.7% from a year earlier, outpacing overall power output growth by close to 10 percentage points.<br />Beijing’s policies on new coal power plants have also been highly mercurial in recent years. In early 2021, China had 247 gigawatts of coal power capacity under development according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air. That is 21% above end-2019 levels and about six times the size of Germany’s entire coal fleet.<br />And as it happens, all those new wind turbines and solar power plants don’t actually mix well with coal power, which is less convenient to turn on and off than natural gas when the wind suddenly starts blowing or the sun stops shining. Until last year, China had been making good progress on reducing wind power wastage—only 3.4% of wind power went to waste in the first three quarters of 2020 compared with 17% in 2016, according to China’s energy regulator. But with 72 gigawatts of wind power added last year—roughly three times the average annual increase from 2015 to 2019—that happy trend might be hard to maintain.</td>

      <td>Stars like Emerald Fennell, Alan Kim, Regina King, and Leslie Odom Jr. arrived at the scaled-back, live red-carpet event wearing both polished and surprising looks</td>
      <td>Hollywood is ready to get dressed up again. After a year of pandemic isolation, closed movie theaters and virtual awards ceremonies, the Oscars returned to a scaled-down but lively red carpet at Union Station in Los Angeles Sunday. Additional hubs in Paris and London provided opportunities for nominees across the pond to gather. Exuberance—both sartorial and emotional—was on display. “People are just dying to be out,” said E presenter Naz Perez.<br />According to an email from the show’s producers, the dress code for this hybrid event was described as “a fusion of inspirational and aspirational, which in actual words means formal is totally cool if you want to go there, but casual is really not.” Stars appeared to have interpreted this as a call for fun and flair, with unorthodox suiting, surprising choices and lots of color all in full effect.<br />“After a year of not getting dressed, obviously everyone is like let’s get dressed,” said Michael Fisher, a New York-based celebrity stylist, who dressed presenter Bryan Cranston in a classically appointed tuxedo by Prada.<br />Many men departed from that classic script, taking this modified red carpet as an opportunity for maximum rule breaking. Colman Domingo of “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” made a splash in a taut flamingo-pink, three-piece suit by Atelier Versace that was embellished with 4,500 Swarovski crystals. Fan favorite Alan Kim, the 9-year-old “Minari” star, wore a Thom Browne shorts suit with dark knee socks (but his best accessory preshow was his adorable puppy Cream).<br />For several stars, their exuberance appeared to take the form of dressing as an actual Oscar statuette, by dressing in attention-grabbing gold. Leslie Odom Jr., who starred as Sam Cooke in “One Night in Miami…,” arrived in a metallic gold Brioni suit with a matching gold shirt and pocket square. Andra Day, nominated for her role as Billie Holiday in “The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” drew inspiration from the icon herself, as well as Diana Ross in her interpretation, for her gold metal mesh Vera Wang gown. Best-actress nominee for “Promising Young Woman,” Carey Mulligan wore a golden combo by Valentino Haute Couture. Questlove, the musical director for the show, finished off his otherwise dark outfit with a pair of shimmering gold Crocs.</td>

      <td>The governor changed the curfew for bars and restaurants recently despite amended law</td>
      <td>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s recent extension of a statewide curfew on bars and restaurants shows the limits of a law intended to curtail the unilateral powers he received in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, Republican lawmakers say.<br />The law was enacted in early March, as the Democratic governor grappled with accusations that he sexually harassed former female aides and requests for documents from federal prosecutors about the state’s policies around Covid-19 in nursing homes.<br />Facing public pressure to respond, state lawmakers voted to amend a March 2020 law that gave Mr. Cuomo the power to issue unilateral directives necessary to cope with any declared disaster. He used it during the pandemic to issue more than 150 executive orders that closed schools, changed election procedures and set parameters for business operations.<br />The amended law prevents the governor from issuing new directives, but it allows him to extend existing rules if he gives notice to the Democrat-dominated state Assembly and Senate. He did so last Monday, signing an executive order that pushed back the curfew for bars and restaurants to midnight from 11 p.m., starting on April 19 and effective until May 19. The businesses would also still be required to sell food along with drinks. Restaurateurs object to the policies, which they say hurt sales and don’t have a clear public-health rationale.<br />Republicans said the episode shows that the changes enacted this year were little more than for show. They said the curfew should expire.</td>

      <td>Biden’s capital-gains rate of 43.4% would reduce federal revenue.</td>
      <td>If you need more evidence that ideology more than common sense is driving the Biden Presidency, look no further than its trial balloon to raise the top tax rate on capital gains to 43.4%. It’s the dumbest way to raise taxes for many reasons, not least because it will cost the government revenue.<br />The premise behind the tax increase is that a preferential tax rate for long-term capital gains is an unjustified loophole. (Gains on assets held for less than a year are taxed at the individual income rate.) Yet that preferential rate has persisted for decades, through Democratic and Republican administrations. The current top rate is 23.8%, which includes a 3.8% ObamaCare surcharge on income above $200,000. Even in the economically irrational 1970s the top capital-gains rate never broke 40%, as the nearby chart shows.<br />There are good economic and fairness reasons for the preferential rate. First, under current tax rules, all gains from investments are fully taxed, but all losses are not fully deductible. Losses can offset gains in any given year, but losses that exceed gains can only be offset against personal income up to $3,000. The preferential rate compensates for this asymmetry.<br />Second, gains in asset values aren’t adjusted for inflation, so investors who hold assets for an extended period pay taxes on increases that are partly illusory. Other parts of the tax code, including the income-tax brackets, are indexed for inflation, but not capital gains that arguably need it the most since assets are often held for decades.<br />Third, a capital-gains tax is a second tax on corporate income. A neutral revenue code would tax all income only once. But the U.S. also taxes business profits when they are earned, and President Biden wants to raise that tax rate by a third (to 28% from 21%). When a business distributes after-tax income in dividends, or an investor sells the shares that have risen in value due to higher earnings, the income is taxed a second time.</td>

      <td>Democrats vote to condone discrimination in higher education.</td>
      <td>The Senate passed a hate-crimes bill last week that gives grants to states and localities for more reporting on incidents and orders a Justice Department review. The vote was 94-1. But that bipartisan vote obscures a sharp partisan difference on anti-Asian bias laid bare as Democrats defeated a Republican amendment to stop discrimination in higher education.<br />The GOP amendment was a single sentence. It said no college “may receive any Federal funding if the institution has a policy in place or engages in a practice that discriminates against Asian Americans in recruitment, applicant review, or admissions.”<br />All Republicans voted for the amendment, which was sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Democrats voted it down, 49-48.<br />Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono said on the floor that the amendment was “a transparent and cynical attack on longstanding admission policies that serve to increase diversity.” She means elite college policies that have been challenged in court by Asian-American students for penalizing them in admissions.<br />Ms. Hirono apparently thinks it’s “cynical” to take seriously the language in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Constitution that bars discrimination by race. The amendment surely would have passed if the text had substituted another minority group for “Asian Americans.” Yet it did not get a single Democratic vote.</td>

      <td>After Beijing’s trade bullying, Australia tears up two investment deals.</td>
      <td>China increasingly wields its economic power as a political weapon, but that often courts a backlash. The latest example is Australia, where Foreign Minister Marise Payne last week exercised new discretionary power to kill two investment agreements between the state of Victoria and the Chinese government.<br />Beijing had planned to cooperate with Victoria on infrastructure, biotech, advanced manufacturing and technology. A 2018 memorandum of understanding and a 2019 framework agreement, both nixed last week, are part of China’s Belt and Road initiative, which seeks to use money and soft power to expand its global influence.<br />Australia knows what China’s bare-knuckle economic diplomacy looks like. Canberra banned Chinese telecom companies from its 5G network in 2018 and last year Australia supported an independent probe into the origin of Covid-19. China is Australia’s top trade partner, and the Communist Party has responded with tariffs and trade restrictions targeting Australian wine, beef, coal, lobster, timber, barley, sugar and copper ore.<br />Economist Marcel Thieliant estimated that “the goods and services already in the firing line are worth nearly a quarter of Australia’s exports to China” and warned that “the escalating trade war is another reason to think that Australia’s economy will never return to its pre-virus path.” That may be overwrought, but there’s no doubt Australia has lost billions of dollars in commodities sales.<br />This is the context that caused Australia’s Parliament in December to give the foreign minister the authority to review and invalidate agreements between foreign entities and Australian states, territories, local governments or public universities. Lawmakers didn’t want state and local governments cutting deals that undermine Australia’s national interest.</td>

      <td>I’m running for mayor so New York can have both public safety and police accountability.</td>
      <td>Brooklyn, N.Y.<br />As the coronavirus pandemic rolls on, New York City is battling an epidemic of crime. It’s the same battle we’ve been fighting for decades. Violence is on the rise. New Yorkers don’t feel safe in their homes or on the street. Many are avoiding the subways out of fear.<br />As a former police officer who patrolled the streets in a bulletproof vest in the 1990s, I know what I am talking about when I say public safety is the prerequisite to prosperity. All New Yorkers, no matter which neighborhood they live in, should be allowed to feel safe. But the debate around policing has been reduced to a false choice: safety or justice.<br />Every New Yorker needs public safety. We need the police. We also need them to be much better than they are. I know this firsthand because I was brutally beaten by cops as a teenager in South Jamaica, Queens, while in custody at the 103rd Precinct. It was a traumatic experience and the reason I became a police officer. I wanted to change the New York City Police Department from the inside. As an officer on the street, I learned that good cops can save lives.<br />To protect people from violent crime and prevent police abuse, we need to recognize that the same communities suffer from both. We must also recognize that reducing crime restores trust, and that measures to restore trust reduce crime when communities work with police to stop violence.</td>

      <td>The CDC is moving too slowly in updating its advice to comport with the scientific evidence.</td>
      <td>When fighting a crisis like Covid-19, health officials can never take for granted the public’s willingness to comply. The measures imposed—social distancing, wearing masks—require sacrifice. As conditions improve, policy makers must show they’re willing to ease restrictions as swiftly as they imposed them, and a critical early test will be on wearing masks outside.<br />Wearing masks and restricting large gatherings were essential to controlling the pandemic’s worst peaks. But infection levels are dropping and vaccination rates rising. This is the time to revisit rules on masking and distancing in low-risk outdoor settings like parks and sports venues. Easing these rules would move more activity outdoors, which reduces viral transmission.<br />In states such as Texas and New Hampshire, governors have lifted restraints on the size of outdoor gatherings and the need for masks. Connecticut, Rhode Island and others have announced plans to relax outdoor requirements in May. But the policy process in Washington is moving too slowly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance still prescribes social limits while outside. Many governors are reluctant to step out ahead of the agency. About half of states still require people to wear face coverings in all public settings.<br />The virus won’t be eliminated. Some 40,000 Americans are hospitalized and some 55,000 cases are diagnosed each day. But more than 80% of Americans over 65 are protected by a vaccine, and infection rates are declining rapidly in most states—including Michigan, this month’s worst-hit. Vaccines are available to anyone over 16 in every state. Soon the problem will be a surplus of doses.<br />Consider a well-known study conducted in China last spring. Researchers traced 318 outbreaks to figure out the chains of transmission. In only one of 318 outbreaks did the initial cases come from contact while outside. The rest originated inside homes or on mass transit.</td>

      <td>A top Obama scientist looks at the evidence on warming and CO2 emissions and rebuts much of the dominant political narrative.</td>
      <td>Physicist Steven Koonin kicks the hornet’s nest right out of the gate in “Unsettled.” In the book’s first sentences he asserts that “the Science” about our planet’s climate is anything but “settled.” Mr. Koonin knows well that it is nonetheless a settled subject in the minds of most pundits and politicians and most of the population.<br />Further proof of the public’s sentiment: Earlier this year the United Nations Development Programme published the mother of all climate surveys, titled “The Peoples’ Climate Vote.” With more than a million respondents from 50 countries, the survey, unsurprisingly, found “64% of people said that climate change was an emergency.”<br />But science itself is not conducted by polls, regardless of how often we are urged to heed a “scientific consensus” on climate. As the science-trained novelist Michael Crichton summarized in a famous 2003 lecture at Caltech: “If it’s consensus, it isn’t science. If it’s science, it isn’t consensus. Period.” Mr. Koonin says much the same in “Unsettled.”<br />The book is no polemic. It’s a plea for understanding how scientists extract clarity from complexity. And, as Mr. Koonin makes clear, few areas of science are as complex and multidisciplinary as the planet’s climate.<br />He begins with a kind of trigger warning for readers who may be shocked by the book’s contradiction of four points of climate orthodoxy: “Heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900” and “the warmest temperatures in the US have not risen in the past fifty years. . . . Humans have had no detectable impact on hurricanes over the past century. . . . Greenland’s ice sheet isn’t shrinking any more rapidly today than it was eighty years ago. . . . The net economic impact of human-induced climate change will be minimal through at least the end of this century.”</td>

      <td>Here, the suffix tends to be pejorative and not about selling.</td>
      <td>Walking around London a few years ago, I’d occasionally see signs that said “Fishmonger” or “Cheesemonger.” In the U.K. “monger” is often the second half of a neutral compound that describes what someone sells. In the U.S. it tends to be used differently; it’s usually the second half of a pejorative term like “hatemonger.”<br />This American use describes someone who is driven by an ugly or foolish passion. In the late 1960s protesters against the Vietnam War often shouted “Warmongers!” when they met counterdemonstrators. Some antiwar activists today embrace the counterphrase “peace mongers.”<br />In the past 50 years the number of pejorative monger terms has proliferated. We now have fear monger, scandalmonger, power monger, atrocity monger, grievance monger, conspiracy monger. I could go on.<br />The most popular use nowadays may be fear monger. Republicans accuse Democrats of fear mongering about global warming; Democrats claim Republicans do the same on illegal immigration.<br />According to the Oxford English Dictionary, monger comes from the classical Latin mango—meaning dealer or trader. The word may also have Germanic roots; mongari is an Old Saxon word. The OED says a monger is “a merchant, trader, dealer, or trafficker (frequently of a specified commodity).” Costermonger originally denoted an apple seller, but “in later use,” particularly in London, “a person who sells fruit, vegetables, fish, etc., in the street from a barrow or handcart.”</td>

      <td>A mutual fund that invests in banks and financial firms was downgraded by  Morningstar  Inc.,  with the rating firm saying the fund was taking too much cryptocurrency risk.<br />In 2020, Emerald Advisers LLC’s Banking and Finance fund bought cryptocurrency funds, as well as invested in cryptocurrency exchange  Voyager Digital Ltd.  and  Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. , a bitcoin-focused firm that offers banking services. Amid a surge in bitcoin and other digital currencies over the past year, those bets have ballooned in size, while the fund’s exposure to regional bank stocks—what it is best known for—fell to one-third of assets in February, the lowest in its 23-year history.<br />Morningstar’s decision to downgrade the fund, disclosed late last week, could have ripple effects for Emerald Advisers. Through its ratings system, Morningstar is the gate keeper for many investors around the world as they evaluate which funds in which to invest.<br />The firm’s portfolio managers say the downgrade is unwarranted. They say they are doing what they have done for decades. In addition, between Oct. 1 and March 31, the largest share class of the $240 million fund generated total returns of more than 90%, net of fees, beating a benchmark of financial stocks.<br />“Since this fund was founded, it seeks growth in the financial service sector—and it hasn’t changed,” said Kenneth Mertz, Emerald Advisers’ investment chief and the fund’s portfolio manager of 23 years.</td>

Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) said Sunday he wants the focus to be on conventional infrastructure like highways and bridges and that spending should be split off from broader items in Mr. Biden’s proposal, such as $400 billion to help care for the aging and those with disabilities.<br />“I do think they should be separated. Because if you start putting so much into one bill, which we call an omnibus bill, it makes it very, very difficult for the public to understand,” Mr. Manchin said on CNN.<br />Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, also from West Virginia, said she had received positive feedback from the White House after she helped craft a $568 billion infrastructure proposal, which was cast as a starting point for bipartisan negotiations.<br />“This is an active conversation, and I think that it’s a good beginning,” she said on CNN of the plan, which doesn’t provide specifics on how to fund the investments and some Democrats say is far too limited.</td>

      <td>He wants to raise the rate on capital gains so high that it would leave everyone worse off.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration last week proposed to increase the capital-gains tax rate—currently 20% for most assets held for at least a year—to 39.6% for people making more than $1 million. Since capital gains are also subject to the 3.8% Medicare tax, the new capital-gains rate would be 43.4%.<br />What makes this unusual is that 43.4% is well above the rate that would generate the most revenue for the government. Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, which does the official scoring and is no den of supply siders, puts the revenue-maximizing rate at 28%. My work several decades ago puts it about 10 points lower than that. That means President Biden is willing to accept lower revenue as the price of higher tax rates. The implications for his administration’s economic thinking are mind-boggling.<br />Even the revenue-maximizing rate is higher than would be optimal. As tax rates rise, the activity being taxed declines. The loss to the private side of society increases at a geometric rate (proportional to the square of the tax rate) as rates rise. The government collects more revenue, but its gains slow as the taxed activity declines. The revenue-maximizing rate is the point at which the government starts losing from higher taxes. Tax rates above the revenue-maximizing rate are punitive: The government is giving up revenue simply to punish the rich.<br />Punishing the rich is distinct from redistribution. Higher taxes on the rich to finance spending, or to transfer money to lower-income people, may be good for society’s welfare. Economists express this idea in a “social-welfare function,” which weights additional income received by different people, usually based on income. The same sum is considered less valuable if it goes to a high-income person than a lower-income one. The weights are subjective and different analysts will choose different weights.<br />Still, economists can agree that the ideal is to make someone better off without making someone else worse off. The simplest case is a voluntary exchange of goods for money, in which the buyer values the purchase at least as much as the price, while the seller values the money at least as much as the item being sold. Economists call such an exchange Pareto-optimal after Vilfredo Pareto, the Italian economist who formally framed the concept.</td>

      <td>Circular logic works its mischief, from phony election claims to ‘systemic racism.’</td>
      <td>Garage bands know about feedback loops. If you place a microphone in front of speakers, the sound picked up by the mic gets amplified and then fed out to the speakers, which the mic picks up and it gets amplified again and again. The circular process turns the sound into a screech or squeal.<br />After the presidential election, some Trump supporters filled  Twitter  with conspiracy theories of election fraud, including a mysterious box in a red wagon in Detroit, ballots “magically found” in Milwaukee at 3 a.m., and fraudulent Georgia signature checks. Almost all were made-up nonsense, later disproved. But President Trump repeated many of these claims, especially in his Jan. 6 “Save America” rally speech: “They should absolutely find that just over 11,000 votes, that’s all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia, and we’re not going to forget it.”<br />The same squid-brained cosplayers who made this stuff up in the first place then believed Mr. Trump when he said, “Make no mistake, this election [was] stolen from you, from me and from the country” and stormed the Capitol. This is the worst case of squealing circular logic that I’ve ever seen.<br />But not the only one. We had endured a summer of protests, with charges of “systemic racism” and calls to “defund the police.” In a June article, former presidential candidate Kamala Harris wrote that “structural racism lives on in our policies and everyday life.” This systemic stuff is good politics.<br />Or is it? Last month, at U.S.-China summit in Anchorage, Alaska, Secretary of State Antony Blinken brought up “deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan.” The top Chinese diplomat, Yang Jiechi, responded with a 15-minute tirade in which he asserted that “the challenges facing the United States in human rights are deep-seated. They did not just emerge over the past four years, such as Black Lives Matter.” I wonder where he got that idea. Circular thinking. Who’s fooling whom?</td>

They question how Georgia partisans’ new power to replace a duly elected county elections board with a single person allows interference with an election. Alarmingly, the law states that a performance review board can be created to investigate and replace officials if the state election board “determines that there is evidence which calls into question the competence of a local election official regarding the oversight and administration of elections, voter registration, or both”—with no definition as to how that might be determined.<br />Microsoft  President Brad Smith complained that the urban counties where Microsoft’s employees live “likely will see an 80 percent reduction in drop boxes, from 40 during the 2020 election to only about eight” and a denial of standard provisional ballots for voters who arrive at changed precincts.

Here’s a look at the why, what and how of overhauling the Supreme Court.<br />No. The first Supreme Court, which had its initial session in 1790, consisted of a chief justice and five associates. Congress altered the number of justices six times in the 19th century. Sometimes it was done in reaction to the court’s political direction, as in 1863, during the Civil War, when President Abraham Lincoln appointed an extra member in a bid to neutralize a pro-Southern majority. The court has had nine members since 1869.<br />Democrats say Republicans unfairly strong-armed a conservative supermajority onto the Supreme Court when they controlled the Senate, first by refusing to hold hearings when President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland (now the U.S. attorney general) in March 2016, a month after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative. That kept the seat open for more than a year, allowing President Donald Trump to appoint Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed in April 2017.<br />The Democrats’ ire redoubled in October 2020 when the GOP-controlled Senate confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett eight days before the presidential election. “Nothing is off the table,” Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, now the majority leader, had warned in September as Republicans mobilized to install Justice Barrett, a conservative, to fill the seat vacated by the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</td>

Its first step down that road will be to start talking about it in the coming months or weeks—Chairman Jerome Powell’s next big test with financial markets.<br />Officials will begin by debating how and when to scale back, or taper, the $120 billion-plus of Treasury and mortgage bonds the Fed has been buying each month since last June to hold down long-term borrowing costs.<br />That conversation hasn’t yet kicked off, according to public comments from central bankers and minutes from their March 16-17 policy meeting. The Fed said in a postmeeting statement that the U.S. labor market and inflation would have to make “substantial further progress” before it begins to reduce its bond program. Asked at a press conference whether it was time to start talking about talking about reducing bond purchases, Chairman Jerome Powell said, “Not yet.”<br />At the time, economic forecasts were calling for a pickup in growth, but hard data were still reflecting a slowdown during the winter Covid-19 surge.

An aggressive run at its rival during the pandemic has helped it eclipse Emirates as the world’s biggest long-haul carrier—for now.<br />Doha-based Qatar is flying planes that are often near-empty on routes around the globe to increase market share. It is using a downsizing at Emirates to hire staff. And while other airlines have reduced services to markets closed by Covid-19, state-backed Qatar is pursuing new landing rights to emerge stronger post pandemic.<br />In the past 12 months, Qatar has flown more seats further than any other airline on cross-border routes, according to data firm OAG.

      <td>India is simultaneously battling the world’s fastest-growing surge of infections and carrying out one of the most logistically complex vaccination campaigns. New Delhi has set a target of vaccinating 300 million of its more than 1.3 billion people by the fall.<br />Some of those doses will be transported hundreds of miles—by truck, plane, scooter, boat and even on foot—before being injected into the arms of people living in small, remote villages. Along the way, each dose must be tracked and kept chilled. The enormous challenge has become all the more urgent as infections have skyrocketed in recent weeks. Here is the story of one dose’s 1,500-mile journey.<br />PUNE, India—A half-milliliter dose of a vaccine developed by  AstraZeneca  PLC and the University of Oxford began its life here in a 1,500-liter metal tank, along with millions of others in batch number 4120Z017, months before it was approved for use.<br />The tank—one of the bioreactors used to grow the cells to make vaccines—produces millions of doses at a time. Bioreactors are the workhorses of the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine maker. The Institute started making and stockpiling doses as soon as it got the formula and tiny seed vial of material used to grow the vaccine from AstraZeneca in May.<br /></td>

      <td><br />After the worst year for the global economy since the Great Depression, the West looks set for a vigorous rebound as mass vaccination against Covid-19 propels a return to more or less normal life.<br />The revival, though, will come in stages, as the timing and speed of recoveries in North America and Europe will depend largely on the pace and reach of vaccination, economists say. Economies in North America and Europe are expected to fire up as shops, restaurants and hotels throng with newly inoculated consumers armed with savings they amassed during the long pandemic. Moody’s Analytics estimates households world-wide had $5.4 trillion in pandemic-related savings at the end of the first quarter.<br />Countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. are expected to enjoy quicker consumer-led recoveries as their governments close in on vaccination goals. Data Thursday are expected to show  the U.S. growth accelerated in the first quarter as coronavirus-related restrictions eased and vaccination coverage increased.<br />In Europe, where vaccination drives have been beset with supply hiccups and worries over side effects, economies are likely to take longer to shake off their lockdown-induced torpor. Data Friday are expected to show the 19-nation eurozone shrank in the first quarter as chunks of the currency area reimposed public-health restrictions to tame new waves of infection, though more up-to-date business surveys suggest growth was already coming back in April.</td>

Promoters of the SPAC still stand to make millions.<br />The paper gains for insiders, even as shares of  MultiPlan Corp.  fall, result from the unique incentives given to SPAC creators, also known as sponsors. They are allowed to buy 20% of the company at a deep discount, a stake that is then transferred into the firm the SPAC takes public. Those extremely cheap shares let the creators make, on average, several times their initial investment. They also let the SPAC backers make money even if the company they take public struggles and later investors lose money, a source of criticism for the process.<br />In the case of MultiPlan, the SPAC was called Churchill Capital Corp. III and the sponsor was former  Citigroup Inc.  deal maker Michael Klein. He shared the discounted investments with other advisers at his investment bank, M. Klein & Co., and financial partners in a way that goes beyond what was publicly disclosed, according to a statement from the SPAC team’s spokesman.<br />Even though MultiPlan shares are down about 30% since early October, those shares and other investments are valued at about $140 million at today’s prices, and only cost the sponsor team roughly $20 million, according an analysis of regulatory filings by New York University Law School professor Michael Ohlrogge, who studies SPACs and corporate incentives.<br />The SPAC spokesman didn’t dispute the figures.</td>

He has appeared multiple times on the podcast of Joe Rogan—the comedian, television host and mixed martial arts commentator—including a September 2018 episode in which a video recording appeared to show Mr. Musk smoking marijuana. Shares in Tesla fell after the event.<br />The Tesla chief also has made a number of film and TV cameos, including “Iron Man 2” and episodes of “The Big Bang Theory,” “South Park” and “The Simpsons.”</td>

On Friday, FDA and CDC officials said inoculations could continue because their benefits outweigh their risks.<br />Vaccinations can begin as soon as Saturday morning, said FDA’s vaccines chief Peter Marks on a conference call with reporters Friday. The FDA issued updated informational guides that inform vaccine recipients and doctors of the risk of a blood-clotting side effect that has primarily affected adult women under 50. The overall risk is about 1.9 cases per million people, though the risk is about 3.5 times higher for women ages 18 to 49, officials said.<br />Doctors and public-health officials said it could take a few days to schedule appointments but welcomed the return of J&J’s vaccine after last week’s pause sent states scrambling to reschedule thousands of appointments.<br />“It does have some advantages over the other vaccines in particular populations where it may be difficult to give them a second shot,” said Onisis Stefas, chief pharmacy officer at Northwell Health. “We really need to have multiple options out there to have people comfortable to get vaccinated so we can get to herd immunity.”</td>

      <td>Mass killings claimed more than a million lives as Ottoman forces expelled or killed ethnic Armenians</td>
      <td>President Biden formally recognized the Armenian genocide, which claimed more than a million lives during the tumult of World War I as Ottoman forces expelled or killed ethnic Armenians during the unraveling of the empire. The massacres continue to stir enmity in the Middle East today.<br />Washington has been wary of recognizing the genocide for fear of damaging relations with Turkey. Modern-day Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and an important partner in the Middle East. Congress voted in a nonbinding resolution to recognize the killings as genocide in 2019. Previously, President Ronald Reagan, who started his political career among a large Armenian-American population in California, referred to the massacres as a genocide in comments about the Holocaust and other atrocities. Other presidents, however, have stopped short of using that terminology during their time in office.<br />The killings took place as the Ottoman Empire began to implode. Its forces suffered a series of shattering defeats after entering World War I on the side of Germany, and the country’s leaders responded by reshaping it as an ethno-nationalist state that would later become Turkey. They targeted Armenians and other minorities for expulsion or worse. Armenians mark the start of the genocide as April 24, 1915, the day the Ottoman government arrested Armenian intellectuals and leaders. They were subsequently executed, while Armenians serving in the Ottoman armed forces were disarmed and killed.<br />Paramilitary forces eradicated entire villages of Armenians, who are predominantly Christian. Other Armenians were forced to convert to Islam, and others saw their property seized before being deported. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians are believed to have died in 1915 and 1916 when they were marched from their homes in the eastern Anatolia region into the Syrian desert, where they were executed or died of starvation or disease. The International Association of Genocide Scholars estimates that the total death toll was more than a million people. The United Nations Convention on Genocide from 1948 defines genocide as acts designed to destroy in whole or in part a particular national, ethnic, racial or religious group.<br />Many Armenians, especially those who lived in what was then Constantinople or along the coast of the Mediterranean, left to settle in Europe or the U.S. The genocide is a binding element in the life of the diaspora, and April 24 is marked each year. The Armenian community in the U.S. has been particularly vocal in lobbying for Washington to formally recognize it. Up to 1.5 million Americans have Armenian ancestry, with more than two million Armenians in Russia.</td>

      <td>The annual acknowledgment of the passing of our movie idols reminds us of our own mortality. And after a year of pandemic, it offers a rare shared catharsis.</td>
      <td>For all of their sweep and scale, the movies can be a curiously intimate art form. Like members of our extended family, movie stars with long careers dip into and out of our consciousness over the course of decades. We watch them grow old. Audiences who discovered, say, Jimmy Stewart early in his stardom were able to see, in real time, his evolution from a stammering, rangy youth to a shambling eminence as familiar as a grandparent. Each new movie represented another page in the scrapbook.<br />When such stars finally leave us, the news can cut to the quick. From Rudolph Valentino to Natalie Wood to Chadwick Boseman, movie history is replete with untimely deaths that leave fans devastated. But even the less shocking departures—such as Mr. Stewart’s at the age of 89—can have an impact, reminding us of our own ticking clocks. We age along with our stars, and if death can rob us of them, it is sure to come calling for us, too.<br />An enduring expression of this bond with the movies and their stars is an integral part of what is often considered a superficial annual tradition—the Academy Awards. After a one-time appearance in 1978, each Oscar broadcast since 1994 has included an “In Memoriam” segment: a sometimes syrupy, often elegant and always earnest montage of film clips and stills assembled in homage to the movie greats who died during the previous year.<br />The segment has become one of the most beloved, and debated, parts of the program. “There were some people who said they cried when they looked at some of the images,” said Michael J. Shapiro, 81, who helped develop the segment and edited it for many years. “I love that I was able to touch somebody with images of people that we grew up with in darkened theaters.”<br />On Sunday night, the first coronavirus-era Academy Awards will air live on ABC. Due to the pandemic, there will be a new main venue (Union Station in Los Angeles), and the exact status of red-carpet arrivals, song-and-dance numbers and other Oscar staples is unclear. Producers have said that some traditional elements will be omitted—but not “In Memoriam.”</td>

He gave his dispute with the world’s biggest company a code name: Project Liberty.<br />The clash was a bold gambit from a man who built an empire around “Fortnite,” the online multiplayer shooter game filled with cartoonish characters that became a phenomenon beloved by teenagers around the world. The ambition of Epic Games Inc.’s chief executive was that Fortnite’s legions of devoted young fans could turn it into a thriving social network, and help realize his vision of the “metaverse,” a shared virtual world where people might one day live, work and hang out.<br />Mr. Sweeney saw Apple as a central roadblock to that vision, according to people familiar with his thinking and documents unveiled in a recent court proceeding, because of the iPhone maker’s tight control over how people access “Fortnite” and any other mobile apps from Epic. Apple’s App Store takes a 30% cut of Epic’s revenue from those users.<br />Epic circumvented Apple’s fees and rules last August by introducing its own system for processing user purchases into mobile versions of “Fortnite.” It also prepared for a larger legal and public-relations campaign, complete with a video mocking a legendary Apple ad and the social-media hashtag #FreeFortnite.<br />“You’ll enjoy the upcoming fireworks show,” Mr. Sweeney said in an email to an ally at  Microsoft Corp.  on the eve of the plan’s launch. Apple made that email public in a court filing, along with other emails and witness testimony cited in this story.</td>

      <td>Ribbed knit combos, like the one Mary Tyler Moore wore in 1969, are proving a popular spring answer to the comfort vs. style conundrum</td>
      <td>I FEEL LIKE I’m cheating,” said Sara Idacavage of the implausible comfort she enjoys when she leaves the house in the vintage knit pant-and-top sets that dominate her wardrobe. “I’m getting away with wearing pajamas out,” she added with genuine disbelief in her voice. “People say, ‘You look so fancy!’ [but] I could straight up fall asleep right there.” Ms. Idacavage, 34, a fashion historian in Athens, Ga., sports these slinky sets with heels and a belt for a night out; combines them with smoking slippers and statement earrings for cocktails at home; or, if she’s grocery shopping, pulls on Converses and a backpack. Her preferred knit hues? Seventies shades like peach and turquoise.<br />Ms. Idacavage’s style antecedent, Mary Tyler Moore, went with cream for the ribbed knit set (above) that she wore in 1969 to fly from London to Los Angeles. On her revolutionary sitcom, which debuted in 1970, Ms. Moore sought to represent women who were asserting themselves in the workplace—mostly wearing the same suits, skirts and sweater vests as her real-world counterparts. Here, however, she showcases a more fluid form of practicality: effortless enough for trans-Atlantic travel (and high kicks), but swank enough for a photo shoot, especially when paired with a chain belt and loafers.<br />Americans might not be jetting overseas soon, but the world is cautiously reopening. And as we tentatively dine out or repopulate our socially distant cubicles, many women want it all—outfits that fuse the comfort of stretchy quarantine clothes with the unembarrassing polish of grown-up garb. Spring’s many malleable knit sets deliver that laid-back luxury. “A knit set is the perfect way to segue into going back out into the world,” said Beth Buccini, founder of New York boutique Kirna Zabête, whose customers have been gravitating to elevated knitwear. She cites a bell-sleeved style by New York brand Proenza Schouler (below) as a versatile “dream for work, dinner, office—all that stuff.”<br />The label’s designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez fixated on that exact formula when they conceived the viscose-blend set in lockdown. “We wanted something that felt cozy and comfortable, but not a schlumpy-looking tracksuit,” said Mr. McCollough who, like most of us, seems fed up with the whole style-be-damned athleisure thing.<br />Victor Glemaud, a New York knitwear designer specializing in punchy patterned ensembles, put things more bluntly: A knit set is “the perfect transitional outfit because it’s [actually] an outfit…It’s pulled together but you don’t have to think about it.”</td>

      <td>Auto makers’ powerful new all-electric trucks and SUVs are attracting U.S. customers who wouldn’t otherwise shop for green machines; ‘Tesla to me is a yuppie vehicle’</td>
      <td>Bob Dykes speaks in the gravelly drawl you’d expect of a man who grew up in Wyoming and owns an oil-and-gas company. He’s 69 years old, calls himself a political independent and is agnostic about global warming. He’s also about to buy his first all-electric vehicle. Not one from Elon Musk, however. “ Tesla  to me is a yuppie vehicle,” he says.<br />The 1,000-horsepower beast he preordered from  General Motors  is the new electric Hummer. It will be the third Hummer Mr. Dykes, whose family-owned company operates in 14 states, has owned and, at $112,595, the most expensive. He says what sold him were the ads. GM bought a spot featuring basketball superstar LeBron James in this year’s Super Bowl.<br />Hundreds of thousands of consumers have preordered either the Hummer EV, the electric pickup truck from U.S. startup Rivian or Tesla’s Cybertruck. More have expressed interest in electric SUVs such as the Toyota bZ4X and Mercedes-Benz EQB, and electric versions of pickups such as the  Ford  F-150 and Chevy Silverado, a close relative of the Hummer.<br />These vehicles are advertised with promises of long battery range, high towing capacity, all the extras typical of midrange luxury vehicles—and hardly a mention of their eco-friendly bona fides. If previous electric autos were marketed to people concerned about climate change, these are pitched to people more concerned about surviving its aftermath. Ads for these vehicles, showing the great outdoors and gritty downtowns in equal measure, suggest that even if oceans rise and forests burn, you’ll be cruising to your bugout cabin on nothing but sunlight and self-satisfaction.<br />These aren’t your California cousin’s EVs. In fact, a growing number of economists, sociologists and psychologists say they could turn even guys who grew up on ’60s muscle cars into something they might not have identified as before: environmentalists.</td>

Israel says it holds Gaza ruler Hamas responsible for any violence coming from the Gaza Strip.<br />In a statement, Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said Israel’s bombing of Hamas targets in Gaza as well as the recent clashes in Jerusalem are “part of its comprehensive aggressive policies against our people.” Hamas did claim the rocket fire but said “what the Palestinian resistance is doing in response to this aggression is within the framework of carrying out its national duty to protect and defend the interests of our people.”<br />No casualties were reported in either Israel or Gaza.</td>

      <td>Smart pill dispensers take on the job of reminding you to take your medicine, but for patients with memory loss, tech still needs a helping hand</td>
      <td>When Stephanie Luehrs’s father began losing track of what day it was, she knew his pre-filled pill packs were no longer going to work, even though they were carefully labeled. So she bought him a high-tech pill dispenser.<br />The MedMinder device she got has compartments for every day of the week, and they pop open with a beep when it’s time to take the pills stored inside. Ms. Luehrs gets a text notification if her dad hasn’t taken his pills. When she learned he missed some doses, she went to his apartment and turned up the volume on the machine. One day, she got a notification that the machine was operating on backup battery—her father, who has Alzheimer’s, had unplugged it. Another time, he didn’t close one of the compartments properly and the box got jammed. Ms. Luehrs had to call customer service, which remotely unlocked the compartments, and then she closed them properly.<br />People like Ms. Luehrs are finding that when it comes to pill-taking, technology only works with human involvement, especially for people with memory loss. “The machine is great, but you definitely want to have someone to help with refills or other issues,” Ms. Luehrs, of Rogers, Minn., said.<br />Numerous products and services are designed to make pill-taking easier, from “smart” caps like Pillsy, which screw onto prescription bottles and chirp when it’s time to take pills, to the type of automatic pill dispensers Ms. Luehrs uses.<br />Other types include Hero, Dose Flip and MedaCube, which hold weeks’ or even months’ worth of pills and can be programmed to release the right amount at the right time. The devices sound an alarm to indicate it’s time to take pills; most also work with apps so that caregivers can get notifications of missed doses.</td>

      <td>The composition of today’s economy is very different from past ones following recessions</td>
      <td>The U.S. economy is poised to grow at its fastest pace in decades, carried along by a wave of pent-up demand built during the pandemic and the trillions of dollars of support the government has provided over the past year.<br />But what that boom will look like—how long it will last, what it might do for employment, how much inflation it might generate—isn’t clear. The grab bag of history doesn’t offer many periods in living memory when gross domestic product grew as quickly as forecasters expect for this year, and those past experiences came about when the composition of the economy was very different from today.<br />Economists surveyed by IHS Markit estimate on average that real, or inflation-adjusted, GDP will be 6.7% higher in the fourth quarter of 2021 than it was a year earlier. That would mark the strongest year of growth since 1983, when the economy was, as it is now, taking off out of a deep recession. Even that could prove conservative, as there is still a measure of caution in current forecasts, reflecting the possibility that the Covid-19 crisis could flare up again.<br />Given the likelihood of strong growth this year, the big question facing investors, businesses, policy makers and ordinary people is what will happen next, but the most honest answer to that might be a shrug.<br />Some economists, including former Treasury Secretary and Obama White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers, worry that the amount of stimulus that is getting poured into the economy is excessive. Indeed, with forecasters looking for the economy to grow an additional 3.3% next year, by the end of 2022 GDP could be 2.7% above the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of its “potential,” or the level it can sustain without running too hot. The last time GDP got that far above potential was 1973, when the U.S. was experiencing a serious inflation problem that wouldn’t be snuffed until the early 1980s.</td>

      <td>Chip company is paying $2.75 billion to acquire Silicon Labs’ infrastructure and automotive business</td>
      <td>Skyworks  is paying $2.75 billion to diversify its business away from  Apple Inc.  Wall Street thinks the chip maker is getting a bargain.<br />Skyworks, which specializes in radio-frequency chips that filter out interference for smartphones and other wireless devices, is spending that much in cash to acquire the infrastructure and automotive business from  Silicon Laboratories .  The deal will give Skyworks more exposure to such hot markets as electric vehicles, 5G equipment and data centers. It will also lessen its exposure to smartphones—and Apple in particular. The tech titan accounted for 56% of Skyworks’ revenue for the fiscal year ended Oct. 2.<br />But diversity has its price. The deal represents Skyworks’ largest acquisition on record and is more than double its last reported cash balance of $1 billion, requiring the currently debt-free chip maker to lever up.<br />Still, the acquired business brings operating margins of close to 40%, leading Karl Ackerman of Cowen to project that the deal will add about 5% to Skyworks’ per-share earnings by next year. The company told analysts Thursday that it expects to delever quickly in the first 18 months after the deal closes. As an added plus, the deal doesn’t require seeking approval from China—which has been a major obstacle to chip mergers involving U.S. companies. Skyworks’ stock price jumped 4.1% on Friday.<br />Being a key supplier to Apple certainly isn’t all bad. The popular new iPhone 12 lineup helped Skyworks post record revenue of $1.5 billion for the first quarter ended Jan. 1. That represented a surge of 69% year-over-year—the company’s best growth rate in 18 years. Analysts expect 50% year-over-year revenue growth for the company’s second quarter, which will be reported Thursday.</td>

      <td>An Indonesian navy submarine that disappeared off the island of Bali this week with 53 people on board is believed to have sunk, the country’s military said after recovering debris from the vessel, including periscope lubricant and a prayer mat.<br />The German-made submarine, KRI Nanggala-402, lost contact with authorities early Wednesday during a torpedo drill, prompting a dayslong search using helicopters, ships with sonar capability and underwater drones. A navy spokesman said the submarine had been detected at 850 meters, far deeper than the 500 meters it was designed to survive.<br />Adm. Yudo Margono, navy chief of staff, said at a news conference Saturday bodies of the crew haven't been found. Air supply on board would have been depleted by Saturday morning, unless the submarine’s electrical system was still functioning, which could extend supply until Monday, he said. The pieces of debris that were recovered indicated cracks in the submarine rather than an explosion, in part because sonar would have picked up a blast, he said.<br />The cause of the accident is unclear. The submarine, operated by Indonesia for 40 years, was in good condition before the exercises, the chief said. After diving to fire a torpedo early Wednesday, it didn’t come back up, and failed to respond. Oil spills detected hours later suggested the submarine’s fuel tank may have been damaged by water pressure.<br />Neighboring countries, including Singapore and Australia, dispatched ships to aid in the search. On Friday, the U.S. said it was sending airborne assets, including a Navy P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft.</td>

The man, expecting the military regime would come for him sooner or later, was at a hideout. They took his wife instead, said her parents, who were present.<br />That was the last time anyone in the family heard from the woman, who was brought to a local police station for questioning but wasn’t there the next day. Perhaps she had been moved to a prison in the nearby city of Taunggyi, police told the inquiring family, so her parents went there with a package of clean clothes, some snacks and a toothbrush. A guard accepted it, they said, but wouldn’t confirm her whereabouts.<br />“I feel so sorry and worried,” said her husband, speaking by phone from his hideout. “It’s clear that they came for me; they took her as a hostage.”<br />The woman is one of hundreds detained and held in undisclosed locations throughout the country since the coup, leaving lawyers scrambling to find them and families unsure whether their loved ones are alive. The arrests are both targeted and random, sweeping up politicians, protesters and anyone in their orbit. They are intended to crush opposition to the military’s seizure of power.</td>

      <td>With six more states having expanded eligibility for Covid-19 vaccinations, every American aged 16 and older who wants a shot can get one. The question now is just how many actually want it.<br />On Wednesday, President Biden introduced a tax credit for small businesses to offset paid leave for employees to get a Covid-19 vaccine dose, part of an effort to spur hesitant Americans to get vaccinated. The announcement came amid signs that the pace of vaccinations is slowing.<br />The Biden administration reached its goal this week of giving 200 million doses within the president’s first 100 days. But there are signs that supply may be outstripping demand. Some states that led the way early in the vaccine rollout are finding it difficult to sustain that success. In mid-February, Alaska, New Mexico and West Virginia saw at least one in seven residents get a shot, ahead of the one-in-10 rate nationally. But as vaccine eligibility has expanded, many of those early advances have slowed. Today, only New Mexico remains in the top 20 states for vaccination rates.<br />Early leaders in the vaccine rollout have been overtaken by states on the East and West Coasts, as vaccinations there have increased. Even as states expanded eligibility beyond the initial priority groups, the upward trend in getting shots in arms is stalling, especially in the South and the Mountain West.<br />Those states top the list in terms of vaccine hesitancy, according to a recent large-scale survey from the Census Bureau. Developed in concert with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Health Statistics, the survey, conducted March 17-29, gauged responses from nearly 80,000 adults.</td>

      <td>According to the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), traveling within the United States presents little risk for fully vaccinated people. But the agency still urges against non-essential trips—at home and overseas—and advises even those who are inoculated to take certain precautions, including wearing a mask and avoiding crowds. For unvaccinated people, the agency maintains that staying home is the surest way to prevent the spread of Covid-19.<br />Yes, but beware the many hurdles.<br />A number of countries, battling rising Covid-19 cases, have renewed national lockdowns. Many borders remain closed to American tourists and both the CDC and the U.S. State Department continue to warn U.S. citizens against all travel even for vaccinated individuals. The State Department recently placed approximately 80% of the world’s countries on its Level Four: Do Not Travel advisory list. Along with health and safety concerns, the State Department warns of unforeseen challenges of traveling during the pandemic, including the possibility that foreign governments could change their restrictions with little notice, which means trip plans could easily go awry and Americans overseas might be stranded. The CDC has also issued country-specific advisories that assess the risk of contracting Covid -19.<br />Among the countries that currently welcome American tourists–including several in the Caribbean, South and Central America and Africa—entry requirements are all over the map, ranging from proof of vaccination and/or a negative Covid-19 test to mandatory self- isolation to the need to adopt electronic trackers.<br />No matter where you travel outside of the U.S., all airline passengers flying back into the country, including U.S. citizens and fully vaccinated travelers, must present a negative Covid-19 test taken within three days of their departure from a foreign country or proof of recovery from coronavirus. Show up at the airport overseas for your departing flight empty-handed and you won’t be allowed on the plane.

Apple unveiled new products Tuesday that include a subscription podcast service, while Spotify has said it plans to launch a subscription-podcasting model. The music-streaming company has been among Apple’s most prominent corporate critics; it claims Apple uses its strength to compete unfairly, a charge the tech company denies. Apple shares lost 1.3% Tuesday, and Spotify shares fell 3.3%.<br />GameStop Corp.<br />It is game over for GameStop’s chief executive. George Sherman will leave his post by July 31, the latest in a series of changes to the videogame retailer’s leadership team since Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen became a board member. Mr. Sherman has been leading the company since April 2019. GameStop agreed to allow Mr. Sherman to retain more than one million shares of restricted stock, worth nearly $175 million as of Friday, as part of a separation agreement. The company has been working with a search firm to evaluate candidates for the role, focusing on people with a background in the technology or videogame industries. GameStop shares rose 6.3% Monday.<br />Tesla Inc.</td>

      <td>The Justices hear a major case on privacy and the right of association.</td>
      <td>That politics makes strange bedfellows is an old observation, yet Monday’s lineup at the Supreme Court remains a sight to behold. On one side is California, which is demanding that nonprofit groups hand over lists of their major donors.<br />Arrayed on the other side: The Americans for Prosperity Foundation (AFPF), a project of Charles Koch; the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund; a Christian law center named for Thomas More; the Council on American-Islamic Relations; and the Human Rights Campaign. We could go on.<br />Monday’s paired cases, consolidated under AFPF v. Rodriquez, ask an important question at a time when people are keelhauled by tweet for having unpopular political views or making a tasteless joke. Donors to nonprofits that are involved in heated issues—say, abortion, religious liberty or transgenderism—deserve robust protections for their privacy.<br />Many nonprofits provide the federal government with the names and addresses of major donors, generally those giving $5,000 a year, on an IRS form called a Schedule B. The legal question here is whether California can set a blanket policy of demanding copies of Schedule Bs as a matter of course. The state says in its brief that donor details help regulators “detect whether a charity is misusing charitable assets.” Looking through the Schedule B haystack is “the first step in evaluating a complaint about a charity.”<br />California could get Schedule B information via subpoenas or audit letters, but it says that’s burdensome, since “more than 100,000 registered charities solicit funds from state residents and 50 to 100 complaints can be received each month.” These are persuasive figures, but not in the direction the state suggests. They multiply to a maximum of 1,200 complaints a year, or 1% of the cited number of total charities.</td>

      <td>The central bank’s ‘groupthink’ isn’t about race and gender.</td>
      <td>The racial politicization of everything continues, and now it’s extending to monetary policy. According to a new Brookings Institution report, a pressing issue at the Federal Reserve is its dominance by white men.<br />“A growing chorus has called on the Fed to diversify its ranks at all levels to reflect better the heterogeneity of the United States,” the report notes, adding “there have only been three Black members of the Fed’s Board of Governors, only one Black Federal Reserve Bank President, and only three nonwhite Federal Reserve Bank presidents in the entire system’s history.”<br />The authors suggest this is because the directors of the 12 regional Fed banks who choose the presidents are mostly white businessmen. Bank directors “are overwhelmingly white, overwhelmingly male, and overwhelmingly drawn from the business communities within their districts, with little participation from minorities, women, or from areas of the economy—labor, nonprofits, the academy—with important contributions to make to Fed governance,” the report says. Promotions of Reserve Bank Presidents from within creates “a risk for groupthink and intellectual homogeneity.”<br />The authors overstate the homogeneity. In 2018 roughly 40% of directors were women and 30% were minorities. Ah, but organized labor representatives and Ph.D.s in economics each only make up 5% of directors. Liberals want to add more non-business people who believe in making social justice and climate the focus of monetary policy.<br />No doubt diverse experience and points of view can be valuable. But if the Fed suffers from groupthink, the reason isn’t gender or race. It’s the lack of differing views on monetary policy.</td>

      <td>A Democrat rebuts the claims of those who want to steal U.S. intellectual property.</td>
      <td>Progressives have been pushing on an open door in the Biden Presidency and Democratic Congress, and some bad policy is the result. So it’s good to see at least some resistance in the Democratic Party to another destructive idea now advancing politically: Suspending intellectual property for Covid vaccines at the World Trade Organization.<br />The resister is Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, who warned Thursday in a web conference at the Center for Strategic and International Studies that “IP rights are under both external and internal attack.” He’s right. South Africa and India last year tossed a grenade at vaccine IP rights at the WTO with a resolution that would allow low-income countries to break patents during the pandemic.<br />The resolution has support from some 80 developing countries, nonprofits and even Democratic Senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Richard Blumenthal and Raphael Warnock. They say waiving IP protections is necessary to surge vaccines to low-income countries and end the pandemic.<br />“Allowing countries to manufacture locally will expedite access to vaccines and treatment, prevent unnecessary deaths, expedite global vaccination efforts, and facilitate a stronger, faster economic recovery,” 10 Democratic Senators wrote to President Biden last week.<br />This couldn’t be more misguided. Existing WTO rules allow low-income countries to compel pharmaceutical companies to license their IP for treatments and vaccines that are essential to public health during epidemics. Covid vaccines developed by Western companies, however, are complicated biologic products. Merely giving low-income countries a vaccine recipe would raise serious safety concerns.</td>

      <td>The Supreme Court crushes the agency for abusing the law.</td>
      <td>Justice Stephen Breyer in a recent speech challenged the media’s partisan characterization of the Supreme Court. On Thursday the Court underscored his point with a 9-0 smackdown of the Federal Trade Commission for rewriting the law to aggrandize its power.<br />At issue in AMG Capital Management v. FTC  was a provision of the Federal Trade Commission Act that lets the agency seek a permanent injunction in federal court for “unfair or deceptive” business practices, however it defines them. The FTC argued that this provision also enabled it to demand monetary relief from alleged offenders.<br />But as Justice Breyer explained for the Court, “an ‘injunction’ is not the same as an award of equitable monetary relief.” A separate provision of the law allows the FTC to obtain monetary relief, but only if a business has violated a commission cease-and-desist order or rule-making. So a business can’t get dunned for doing something that it doesn’t know is wrong.<br />Yet the FTC has increasingly ignored the law’s restrictions on its power. “The Commission tells us that ‘the agency [now] brings dozens of [§13(b)] cases every year seeking a permanent injunction and the return of illegally obtained funds,’” Justice Breyer noted.<br />While the FTC claimed Congress had acquiesced to its revision of the law, Justice Breyer shot down this argument as well as four others. The FTC’s construction of the law “would allow a small statutory tail to wag a very large dog,” he explained.</td>

The suit claimed TD Ameritrade had failed to abide by its duty to seek the best execution for customer stock trades.<br />The decision by a three-judge panel reversed a 2018 ruling from a federal judge in Nebraska who had allowed the suit to go forward.<br />It came as the practice at the heart of the lawsuit—called payment for order flow—came under renewed scrutiny in a series of recent congressional hearings devoted to the wild, Reddit-fueled rally in  GameStop Corp.  stock earlier this year.<br />In Friday’s opinion, the judges didn’t weigh in on the substance of the plaintiffs’ fraud allegations. Instead, they found it would be too difficult to determine which investors had been harmed by TD Ameritrade’s order-routing practices.</td>

Ms. Maxwell also pleaded not guilty to the perjury charges and denies the allegations in the lawsuit.<br />Judge Nathan ruled last week to sever the perjury charges, which were part of the original indictment against Ms. Maxwell last year, on the grounds that they could bring unwieldy legal issues to bear on the sex-trafficking trial.</td>

      <td>The California congresswoman has never been a peacemaker. She’s always been on the side of rioting.</td>
      <td>The Ku Klux Klan was in Huntington Beach, Calif., on April 12, holding a “White Lives Matter” rally. It was a 37-minute drive away from the Hawthorne district office of Rep. Maxine Waters. “Auntie Maxine” (as the Democrat calls herself) declined to confront the Klan. But she flew all the way to Minneapolis last weekend to coach protesters awaiting the outcome of the Derek Chauvin trial.<br />“I hope we get a verdict that says guilty, guilty, guilty,” Ms. Waters said. “And if we don’t . . . we’ve got to stay on the street. We have to get more active, we’ve got to get more confrontational.”<br />The 82-year-old lawmaker has been notorious for such incendiary language since she was first elected to Congress in 1990. She called the 1992 riots that followed the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers who were filmed beating Rodney King an “insurrection.” She meant it as a term of approbation. Sixty-three people died during the L.A. riots, but Ms. Waters declared that she wouldn’t tell her constituents “to go inside, to be peaceful, that they have to accept the verdict.”<br />Ms. Waters has always shunned the peacemaker role in favor of rioting. Thirty years after the L.A. riots, nothing has changed.<br />House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Ms. Waters’s latest remarks. “Maxine talked about confrontation in the manner of the civil-rights movement,” Mrs. Pelosi said. But nothing could be further from reality. As attorney Alan Dershowitz suggested during an interview with Newsmax, Ms. Waters’s rant had more in common with the bile historically spewed by the KKK than the language for which the civil-rights movement is remembered. It was “an attempt to intimidate the jury” in the Chauvin case, he said, a tactic “borrowed precisely from the Ku Klux Klan of the 1930s and 1920s when the Klan would march outside of courthouses and threatened all kinds of reprisals if the jury dared to convict a white person or acquit a black person.”</td>

And, more importantly, not caring.<br />This is becoming a habit in America. Let me correct one misconception in recent  New York Times  reporting on whether the newspaper you’re now reading needs to widen its appeal. Whatever the merits of a debate supposedly under way in our news division, newspapers now are niche businesses—built on narrow appeal, not broad. If you think the New York Times and Washington Post mind in the least that their coverage is off-putting to a large number of Americans, you misunderstand the business they’re in.<br />Once upon a time, broad reach really was our industry’s goal, to meet the desire of our advertisers for as many customers as possible. In turn, this drove our need to cover the news in a way that we could defend to all comers as “objective” and straight down the middle.</td>

      <td>He called for nonpartisan mapmaking. They are rushing to draw theirs without Republican input.</td>
      <td>Springfield, Ill.<br />In his last year in office, President Obama made a trip to the Illinois State Capitol, where he had served as a state senator from 1997 to 2004. In an address to his former legislative colleagues, he advocated for independently drawn legislative maps. “Once the next census rolls around and we have the most up-to-date picture of America’s population, we should change the way our districts are drawn,” he said, before delivering his applause line: “In America, politicians should not pick their voters; voters should pick their politicians.” Mr. Obama wasn’t referring only to Illinois: “And this needs to be done across the nation, not just in a select few states. It should be done everywhere.”<br />Five years later, Illinois Democrats seem to have forgotten Mr. Obama’s admonition. With majorities in both houses of the General Assembly, they are preparing to ram through a new partisan state legislative map. More brazenly, they plan to do it without even consulting the most accurate data set that every unit of government traditionally uses when drawing such maps—the decennial census.<br />In the year following the census, the Illinois Constitution sets a deadline of June 30 for the legislature to draw a map of state legislative districts. Should that process fail, a bipartisan commission of four Democrats and four Republicans is established to draw a map instead. And if the commission deadlocks along party lines and can’t agree on a map before Sept. 5, the Illinois secretary of state then draws a ninth, tiebreaking member out of a hat. Traditionally the hat is a replica of Abe Lincoln’s stovepipe.<br />This year, due to the pandemic, the data needed to draw a map won’t be available until mid-August. That’s too late for the Illinois Constitution’s window for a partisan process driven by the supermajority-Democratic legislature. Rather than risk the bipartisan commission process that might not give them total control over mapmaking, they’re instead planning to use data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, an annual snapshot of less than 1% of the population that tracks national and state trends in demographics. While the decennial census is a count of every person in the U.S., the ACS is a sampling. It was never designed for anything so complex or politically consequential as drawing legislative districts.</td>

Mexican courts are widely seen as ineffective: Most crime in the country goes unpunished, according to government statistics.<br />Yet the bill’s passage is adding to worries among legal scholars and political analysts that Mr. López Obrador wants to concentrate power. He has already weakened a host of autonomous government agencies and often rails against the electoral agency, journalists and civil-society nonprofits; he successfully pressured for the resignation of a Supreme Court justice in 2019.<br />“The legislative power, with López Obrador’s blessing, is clearly violating the autonomy of the judicial power...destroying the separation of powers and breaking the constitutional order,” said María Marván, a legal scholar at Mexico’s National Autonomous University. “It’s a disgrace.”</td>

      <td>Christie Phelps came near her Covid breaking point last year as she contended with a naughty 5-year-old boy, “the most hyper child I’ve ever been around,” in her Indianapolis home daycare. On a particularly bad day he urinated on her fence and cursed in front of playmates. Other child-care providers turn children like him away for behavioral problems, but Ms. Phelps realized that “he needs help.” These days she also asks herself: “How am I going to keep dealing with all this? This is too much stress. I don’t have no one helping me.”<br />Ms. Phelps, 46, has been trying to hire for months, but “no one is biting whatsoever.” Her business, Christie’s Love Bugs, cares for 11 pre-K children and 15 school-age children. She has only four staffers, all part-time, although she offers employees free training, help with certification, and as much as $25 an hour. With no one to fill the jobs, Ms. Phelps works 10- to 12-hour days. She says her mental health has already suffered so much that she’s in therapy, takes medication, and struggles to sleep.<br />Lots of entrepreneurs are overworked these days. The National Federation of Independent Business surveyed more than 500 small businesses and reported last week that 42% of them had job openings they couldn’t fill. “As long as we’ve been conducting the survey, it’s never been that high,” says Holly Wade, executive director of NFIB’s research center. Some 7.4 million jobs were open at the end of February, according to an April 6 report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br />Some workers still fear they’ll contract Covid if they return to the workplace, and some parents are unable to take on full-time work because their children’s schools remain shut. But there’s another reason for the acute labor shortage: It pays to stay on the couch.<br />As Covid spread and the nation locked down last spring, Congress approved enhanced weekly benefits of $600, in addition to the usual state-administered unemployment payments, through July 2020. A working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that 76% of those eligible for the $600 bonus could be given at least as much for being jobless as they’d earn by working. Lawmakers have since trimmed the enhanced unemployment benefits to $300 a week and extended them through September 2021. University of Chicago economist Peter Ganong says that even with the supplemental benefit halved to $300, “42% of workers are making more than their pre-unemployment wage.” And these analyses don’t count food stamps, rental assistance and other government help that may be available to the unemployed, or the stimulus payments that have gone to the employed and jobless alike.</td>

It lays out several possible fee increases, including a vehicle-miles traveled tax that would collect revenue from electric vehicles. Congress hasn’t raised the gas tax, which stands at 18.4 cents a gallon, since 1993.<br />While the bipartisan group doesn’t detail specific funding levels, it does call for federal investments in rail, water infrastructure and broadband. Closing the gap between taxes owed and taxes paid and creating a national infrastructure bank are among other revenue ideas the group lays out.<br />The report comes as President Biden seeks to advance his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan on Capitol Hill. A group of Senate Republicans outlined a $568 billion proposal Thursday, advancing an alternative to Mr. Biden’s plan, which GOP lawmakers have criticized as too broad.<br />“The time is now for Congress and the administration to reach across the aisle, unite and boost investments in our surface transportation network that will move our transportation systems into the 21st century,” said Rep.

Battles that have been confined to the negotiating table now are erupting into public view.<br />The victims’ coalition, which makes up the bulk of sex-abuse claims filed against the Boy Scouts, said the organization isn’t pressuring its insurers to make good on policy contracts. Meanwhile, insurers such as Chubb’s Century Indemnity Co., are critical of victims’ lawyers, pointing to alleged signs they filed questionable claims with little to no vetting.<br />The coalition said the Boy Scouts should no longer remain in exclusive control of their chapter 11 case, in part because of its disapproval of a $650 million settlement with another insurer, Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., last week.</td>

      <td>Proposal to raise top tax rate revives long-running debate over taxation of labor versus investment income</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden is preparing to take a big swing at one of the features of the tax code that affects the wealthiest Americans: how capital gains are taxed.<br />Next week, in his speech to Congress, Mr. Biden is likely to detail plans he outlined during last year’s campaign. As a candidate, he called for raising top capital-gains tax rates to mirror those on other income and for altering a tax provision that lets investors avoid capital-gains taxes on appreciated assets if they hold them until they die.<br />The tax increases would help pay for Mr. Biden’s planned antipoverty and education proposal to be announced next week. While the details of the package are still being worked out, people familiar with the measure said it could cost more than $1 trillion, with funding for child care, paid leave, universal prekindergarten education and tuition-free community college.<br />“Everybody gets hurt in these policies. They’re not pro-growth,” said Rep. Mike Kelly (R., Pa.). “It starts at the top and works its way through the whole economy.”<br />The tax proposals would reignite a long-running dispute between the political parties, along with the economic debate over the effect of investment taxes on growth. Democrats argue for taxing wealth like work, seeking to equalize the top rates on capital income and labor. Republicans and their allies warn that stock prices and business investment could suffer, particularly if these tax changes come atop the corporate tax increases Mr. Biden has also proposed to pay for infrastructure spending.</td>

      <td>What’s the best way to make your outdoor space elegantly enjoyable after dark? With a lighting scheme as layered as your living room’s, say the pros. Here’s how.</td>
      <td>LAST SUMMER, those of us charmed enough to have a backyard to call our own tended our gardens and zhushed our patios with new furniture, maybe even springing for an outdoor rug. When it came to exterior lighting, however, most people aimed no higher than a swag of Edison-bulb string lights and a feebly flickering hurricane candle.<br />“Outdoor spaces sometimes get overlooked after the sun goes down,” said Memphis interior designer Sean Anderson, alluding to such lame attempts at illumination. This spring, however, as we prepare to host en plein air again, why not tackle outdoor lighting—especially if you’ve upgraded everything else? Beyond a wish to enjoy their private plot at night, homeowners light landscapes “so that when you’re inside the house you can see the garden and not just a black hole,” said Ive Haugeland, founding principal of Shades of Green, a landscape architecture firm in Sausalito, Calif.<br />The best way to banish murky shadows is to borrow the sort of layered lighting scheme found in professionally designed living rooms. In simplest terms, you want three tiers. Start with the highest level, via lofty lanterns or up-lighting that draws eyes skyward or even chandeliers (yes, weatherproof versions exist; see “Worth Wiring”). Next fill in the midrange with sconces, illuminated plants or sculptures and tabletop portable lanterns. And don’t forget low-level illumination—that is path, understep and underseat lighting.<br />The cumulative effect should be subtle, not stark, “that feeling of fireflies on a summer night, that sense of discovery,” as San Francisco designer Ken Fulk put it. “The default has previously been an overly lit space.”<br />At a residence in San Francisco, Ms. Haugeland recently hung two outdoor-rated glass chandeliers beneath a minimalist pergola. To provide eye-level glow, she uplit the knotty trunks of century-old olive trees, then set low LED lighting into step risers for safer sauntering after dark. The chandeliers are “a little over the top, so they’re very fun and playful and what you don’t expect to see outside,” said Ms. Haugeland.</td>

      <td>Extolling the virtues of the country’s immigrants, and stressing the oft-ignored difference between legal and illegal immigration, Peggy Noonan makes a good case for Republicans to embrace immigrants with “sympathy and respect” (“Republicans and Immigrants Need Each Other,” Declarations, April 17). To put a finer point on her electoral math: There are far more immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants than there are woke corporate executives who hire them as cheap labor. If Republican can count, they would be wise to focus more on courting the former as voters than the latter as donors.<br />Gregory Marshall<br />Marietta, Ga.<br /><br />In an essay otherwise supportive of immigration, Ms. Noonan writes that illegal immigration “takes jobs” and “depresses wages.” By this logic, growing female participation in the workforce also pushes down pay. Computers, WiFi and other technology should be rethought in consideration of all the labor they displace.</td>

Mr. Koonin is correct to conclude these models “are not to the standard you would trust your life to or even trillions of dollars to.”<br />I was on the leading edge of computer simulation modeling, employing in 1964 a super computer ( IBM  7094) and a simulation language called simscript. I wasn’t modeling climate change, but I quickly learned that data availability was key to accurate forecasts. In climate models, the number of variables is huge and incomplete. For example, there is no way to measure and verify the effect of clouds on climate change. Climate models also have relatively limited time frames of known data. Climate has been changing for millions of years, but accurate global temperatures were never recorded until 1850.<br />Ron Dudley<br />Sanibel, Fla.<br /></td>

In California, the administrator of a Los Angeles Covid Vaccine Hunters Facebook page posted that the hunt is over; doses are plentiful. In Birmingham, Ala., the county health director told reporters Tuesday he is ready to get down on his knees and beg residents to get shots.<br />The U.S. weekly average of vaccine doses administered, which has been generally rising since mid-December, ticked downward last week. The number of people receiving their first dose fell sharply, from a 7-day-average of 1.9 million April 11 to 1.4 million April 17.<br />The Kaiser Family Foundation, the nonprofit, said this week that the country will likely reach a tipping point on vaccine enthusiasm by mid-May, when supply outstrips demand.<br />The moment is an exciting one for many health officials. Protection against the deadly virus is now available, widely, to all over 16 years old, earlier than most had anticipated. It also represents a moment of caution. Will vaccination momentum keep up enough for the country to reach herd immunity and return to normalcy? Or will the effort stall as demand wanes?</td>

      <td>In 18th-century Britain, the aristocratic taste for decorative glass was paid for in part by trade in slaves and opium.</td>
      <td>In the late 18th century, British aristocrats were “not supposed to reveal anything of their inner feelings, their inner lives,” said Christopher Maxwell, curator of early modern glass at the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y. Rather, they tried to present themselves as mirrors flawlessly reflecting the society they were part of, free from the “irregularities” of personal emotions. No wonder fashionable men embraced formal wear encrusted with dazzling glass-jewel embroidery, turning themselves into literal mirrors.<br />“In Sparkling Company: Glass and the Costs of Social Life in Britain During the 1700s,” a exhibition opening May 22 at the Corning Museum, surveys the etiquette and styles that new forms of glass inspired among the period’s elite. Smooth and reflective, glass “really resonated with the polished and polite ideas of modernity,” said Mr. Maxwell, who curated the show.<br />The show features a dessert table laden with glasses, bowls, footed dishes and an impressive “sweetmeat pole,” attesting to the trendsetting impact of lead glass and the prodigious appetite of upper-class Britons for sugary confections. To heighten the effect, members of the museum’s glassmaking team have created historically accurate glass versions of the colorful, eye-catching delicacies—syllabubs, custards, candies, ice creams—that would have filled the sparkling tableware.<br />Exemplifying the use of glass in fashion, a man’s formal coat and waistcoat, made in France around 1780, glimmer with glass-paste “jewels” and embroidery. “The British elite flocked to Paris whenever peacetime permitted, to stock up on French fashions and French luxury goods,” said Mr. Maxwell. That affinity was epitomized by the British “macaroni,” a foppish male figure with “continental predilections and a taste for shiny buckles, big buttons and high hairstyles.”<br />In addition to clothing, glass also shaped elite environments. Improvements in plate-glass manufacture allowed for larger windows in private residences and shops, making them visible from outside and turning them into stages for the performance of polite behavior.</td>

      <td>Independents overwhelmingly oppose plan to add Justices.</td>
      <td>By a large margin, Americans oppose the idea of increasing the number of justices serving on the U.S. Supreme Court. That’s according to a new nationwide survey of 1,100 registered voters conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy. The survey also finds little support for ending the legislative filibuster in the U.S. Senate.<br />Poll participants were asked the following question:<br />A full 65% of respondents said he should not, while just 31% said that he should and 4% weren’t sure. Perhaps it’s no surprise that 95% of Republicans oppose the plan to expand the court, but independents in the survey also resoundingly rejected the idea, with a full 72% saying that the President should not support the court-packing scheme and just 22% saying that he should. And even within Mr. Biden’s party the idea has its share of critics, with a third of Democrats saying he should not back the proposal.<br />Underscoring the widespread perception among voters that the proposal to add justices is a partisan venture rather than a solution to a genuine need in the federal judiciary, a full 90% of Democrats in the survey admit that if President Donald Trump had been re-elected and proposed a Supreme Court expansion from nine to 13 Justices, they would oppose  the plan.<br />Mason-Dixon pollster Brad Coker finds consistently strong opposition among independents to such plans for structural changes, and concludes that moderate and unaffiliated voters did not vote for Joe Biden in 2020 “to turn the government upside-down” or “remake America.” Rather, they were hoping he would bring calm and perhaps “less bickering” to Washington, he adds.</td>

      <td>How is the oil patch’s recovery coming along? Slow and steady, judging by the three major oil field services firms that unveiled results in the past week. That should be music to investors’ ears.<br />Halliburton ,   Schlumberger  and  Baker Hughes  all had decent progress to report, with the first two beating consensus revenue and profit expectations compiled by Visible Alpha. Baker Hughes slightly lagged behind and swung to a net loss, but that was mostly due to a steep drop in the valuation of  C3.ai ,  a software company in which it holds a minority stake.<br />Following the path of oil producers, the servicers, too, are passing up on revenue growth in favor of profitability. Both Baker Hughes and Schlumberger saw sequential revenue declines in the last quarter. Halliburton had only a slight increase. Baker Hughes noted in a Wednesday earnings call that it won’t be “chasing revenue” and that it remains focused on pursuing projects that fatten its bottom line.<br />The macro conditions for oil and gas are undoubtedly improving: OECD oil inventories have been drawn down to levels near their five-year average, working off the massive overbuild from the last year. Brent crude prices also are back to their immediate pre-pandemic levels. Halliburton noted in its Wednesday earnings call that while smaller, private energy companies have dominated the recovery so far, listed drillers are expected to pick up activity in the second half of the year.<br />Oil field servicers’ collective discipline should help them command higher prices as energy companies require more of their services. Despite flattish revenue compared to the prior quarter, all three saw continued margin improvement, benefiting from efforts last year to pare costs, including head count reductions and the use of remote technology for certain services. Also helping their outlook is considerably weakened competition: Oil field services bankruptcies rose to an all-time high of $45 billion in debt affected in 2020 and are continuing this year.</td>

      <td>University researchers use artificial intelligence to reduce characters to the color of their fictional skin.</td>
      <td>One of my favorite childhood novels recounted the story of a boy separated from his family and caught behind Japanese lines in war-torn midcentury China. I felt I was with the boy, Tien Pao, when he woke terrified in a sampan sweeping downriver toward the smoldering ruins of his village. Alongside Tien Pao, I watched a doomed train back into a burning station and heard the screams of its passengers. Together we crouched in the broiling sun, scanning throngs of refugees for a familiar face. Later, we flew in a plane over an aerodrome and I felt his jolt of joy as if it were my own when, far below, he saw his mother.<br />That Tien Pao was a boy and I a girl, that his parents were married and mine divorced, that his skin was one hue and mine another—none of this impinged on the thrilling immediacy of Meindert DeJong’s “The House of Sixty Fathers,” illustrated by the young Maurice Sendak.<br />The teacher who gave me that book widened my horizons and enriched my life. Would she still do so today? I fear not. Schools and the world of children’s literature have been seized by the notion that the most important thing about a book is whether children can “see themselves” in it. This is understood in a narrow and reductive way: The race, ethnicity and sexual orientation of the young reader must be matched by those of the characters they meet in books.<br />What began as a laudable idea—that children’s literature should embrace a variety of stories and all manner of characters—has morphed into monomania. Identity is all. Professional journals that catalog and review new children’s titles now make a fetish of highlighting the pallor or pigmentation of fictional characters.<br />Publisher’s Weekly, for instance, in its review of “Faraway Things,” a forthcoming picture book by Dave Eggers and illustrated by Kelly Murphy, finds it necessary to report a young character is “pale-skinned” and an older one is “brown-skinned.” A reviewer for Kirkus notes: “The captain has dark skin; Lucian and the others have light skin.”</td>

      <td>Price being discussed for Bountiful is in the mid-single-digit billions</td>
      <td>Nestlé SA is in talks to buy the maker of Nature’s Bounty vitamins for a price in the mid-single-digit billions, according to people familiar with the matter, as the Swiss food giant pushes further into nutritional offerings.<br />Nestlé could finalize a deal to buy the Bountiful Co. as soon as next week, some of the people said, though it isn’t guaranteed they will reach an agreement. Bountiful has been planning an initial public offering and could still opt for that path after all, or a different deal.<br />In addition to Nature’s Bounty vitamins, Bountiful’s brands include Pure Protein, which makes protein bars, Osteo Bi-Flex joint-care supplements and Puritan’s Pride vitamins and supplements.<br />Bountiful is majority-owned by private-equity firm  KKR  & Co. In a filing for the IPO earlier this month, Bountiful called itself the largest pure-play nutrition company in North America and one of three largest in the world.<br />Nestlé has signaled it plans to make bigger acquisitions this year and that bulking up in nutrition is a priority as wellness becomes increasingly important for consumers. With 8.6 billion Swiss francs in cash at year-end (equivalent to $9.4 billion now) and a market value of about 310 billion francs, it certainly has the wherewithal to do a deal for Bountiful.</td>

      <td>PARIS—An administrative police worker was stabbed to death in an assault on a police station that investigators were treating as a terrorist attack.<br />An unidentified man Friday surprised a police worker in the entranceway of the police station some 25 miles southwest of Paris as she returned from her car, French officials said. The attacker stabbed the worker in the throat and yelled “Allahu akbar,” Arabic for “God is great,” before police stationed inside shot and killed him, police union officials said on French television.<br />The police worker died of her wounds soon after. She was a mother of two who worked at the reception of the police station, and didn’t carry a gun, one of the union officials said.<br />The attack jolted a nation already reeling from a string of terrorist attacks late last year, including the beheading of middle-school teacher Samuel Paty after he showed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his class.<br />Jean-François Ricard, France’s antiterrorism prosecutor, said Friday he had opened an investigation into the police station attack as a terrorist act in part because the attacker had scoped out the station ahead of the attack, and because of statements he made during the assault.</td>

      <td>Sales in consumer-tissue segment fell more quickly than company expected and supply-chain disruptions took a toll; more price increases are likely</td>
      <td>Kimberly-Clark Corp.  delivered its worst sales performance in at least a decade, hit by supply-chain disruptions, continued business shutdowns and fallout from last year’s toilet paper hoarding amid the pandemic.<br />The maker of Huggies diapers and Cottonelle toilet paper reported an 8% decline in organic sales, which strips out deals and currency moves, for the quarter ended March 31. Sales in its consumer-tissue segment, which includes toilet paper, Scott paper towels and Kleenex tissue, fell 14%.<br />It is a sharp reversal from 2020 when the world’s consumers, stuck at home and hyper focused on cleaning, drove a 6% increase in organic sales for the year as they loaded up on paper towels, cleaning products and other household staples. Consumer-tissue sales last year rose 14%.<br />“I am not pleased with the results,” Kimberly-Clark CEO Michael Hsu said in a call with analysts. He said that while the company expected slower consumer-tissue sales, the extent to which consumers stopped buying toilet paper came as a surprise.<br />Kimberly-Clark’s shares fell more than 5% Friday morning.</td>

      <td>Corporate travel spending on cards remains depressed, but trends such as younger spenders could help</td>
      <td>The next time a banker or consultant calls and wants to fly out to see you, that might be a signal to buy credit-card company stocks.<br />Corporate travel continues to be the biggest laggard in card spending. American Express on Friday said that it expects overall travel-and-entertainment spending by the fourth quarter of this year to reach about 70% of the level in the same period of 2019, mostly driven by domestic U.S. consumer travel.<br />Meanwhile in the business world many offices are still barely open even to regular employees, let alone visitors getting off a plane. While some industrial companies might be getting back to plant visits and substituting car travel for flying, industries such as banking, consulting and legal are still often relying on Zoom meetings.  AmEx  said it currently doesn’t see corporate travel-and-entertainment spending getting back to 2019 levels until perhaps 2023.<br />The question remains whether this business-travel downgrade will be permanent. Cross-border travel might be quite slow to recover too, with new international travel restrictions still being put in place. That puts pressure on volumes: As AmEx put it to analysts on Friday, it takes a lot of domestic first-class tickets to Indianapolis to equal one international first-class ticket to Hong Kong.<br />AmEx shares were down about 2% midday Friday. But the company has other levers it can pull to boost volumes. Small businesses are increasingly digitizing their spending, billing and borrowing, and their spending is far less travel-oriented. AmEx has also added other non-travel perks for consumers, such as streaming-service credits; 95% of U.S. platinum card members who used that reward are continuing to spend on streaming, AmEx said.</td>

      <td>In this latter-day Mayberry, everyone knows everyone else’s business, for better or worse.</td>
      <td>Jane Wilkes is a few weeks into her first year as a second-grade teacher in Boyne City, Mich.—we should all be lucky enough to have a second-grade teacher like Jane—when she meets Duncan Ryfield. If “Early Morning Riser,” Katherine Heiny’s wry, busy second novel, were a movie, the two would be described as meeting cute: Jane, who’s pretty and blond and 26, gets locked out of her house early one Friday evening. Duncan, a woodworker by trade, a locksmith and (very dilatory) restorer of antique furniture by economic necessity, gets the S.O.S. call. He stays for dinner, and then, what with one thing and another, he stays for the weekend.<br />This easy-breezy meeting, along with Jane’s first (besotted) glimpse of Duncan—in his early 40s, medium height, medium build, shaggy auburn hair, standard issue jeans and denim shirt—seems to suggest a novel you could characterize with the title of Ms. Heiny’s 2015 short-story collection, “Single, Carefree, Mellow.” “He seemed to stand out vividly, like the subject of a photo with a blurred background. To Jane he looked like the Brawny paper towel man, and no less handsome.” Rest assured, or perhaps I mean be warned: Ms. Heiny has a good bit more in mind than a droll, winning set piece.<br />Jane, who is immoderately fond of patronizing the local thrift shop, soon learns that Duncan, rather like her new secondhand lace blouse, has previously been on the arm of many others. She “flipped rapidly through her mental files of the past few days. It had seemed to her that every woman they came in contact with had known Duncan by name. Waitresses and cashiers and shopkeepers and receptionists. She had thought it was just living in a small town.”<br />Famously, the course of love does not run smooth. The course of life is an equally rutted path. “Early Morning Riser,” which unfolds episodically over a period of 17 years, has the makings of a witty romantic comedy that evokes the work of Laurie Colwin, but it takes on a dark edge when Jane, believing herself to blame for a fatal car accident, takes on a heavy caretaker role. The consequences are far-reaching—ripples from a stone that’s heaved into a river.<br />In Ms. Heiny’s hands, Boyne City becomes a latter-day Mayberry where, for better or worse, everyone knows—and broadcasts—everyone else’s business and where the oddball members of the citizenry seem to far outnumber the conventional ones, like the steady, patient Jane and the good-natured Duncan (who, frankly, never comes much into focus). The quirky characters provide contrast and texture—and they do enliven a dinner party—but a little eccentricity goes a long way.</td>

      <td>With a deceptively light touch, the author known as Teffi conjured a Russia of everyday miracles.</td>
      <td>The stories in “Other Worlds” conjure a vanished Russia. Candle flames flicker on the dark faces of family icons, a coachman bites into a black radish, and in the deep forest a wolf speaks with a human voice. Above all, this collection reveals the spiritual threads woven into the fabric of old Orthodox observance.<br />Teffi (1872-1952), born Nadezhda Lokhvitskaya, remains best known in her native land for the light and largely satirical sketches she wrote before the revolution, a period in which she was so well known that she had sweets named after her. This volume presents a selection of stories featuring, in the words of the subtitle, a lively cast of “peasants, pilgrims, spirits [and] saints.”<br />The material, drawn from five collections, is arranged more or less chronologically by publication date. Many stories are autobiographical, notably “Kishmish,” an account of a trembling 8-year-old’s pre-dawn anguish, a racking despair that does not fade with the years. Except for very occasional excursions to Petersburg and Moscow, events unfurl on ramshackle country estates. Teffi focuses on the servants who made such estates possible, especially the nyanya, a recurring figure typically hired first as a wet nurse and then as the general custodian of the children. The nyanya is a much loved repository of lore.<br />Teffi tells many of her tales in the first person (“Afanasy Yevmenievich had a textile stall in our town market”), and her prose creates the illusion both of spontaneity and confidentiality (“I’m going to tell you a story I heard from a very respectable lady”). The narrator has no authorial omnipotence (“I’ve no idea what became of him”), thus inviting the complicit reader into a private world. Teffi was a friend of Nobel laureate Ivan Bunin (1870-1953), and, like him, she was also a poet. But as editor Robert Chandler writes in his introduction to “Other Worlds,” her “poetic gifts found their truest expression in prose.” Descriptive passages are quietly lyrical—an evening mosquito, for example, is a “long-legged dancer.”<br />“Solovki,” which first appeared in the émigré journal The Firebird and subsequently in the 1924 collection “Evening Day,” recounts a pilgrimage from Arkhangelsk, in the far north of western Russia, to the Solovetsky Islands (also known as Solovki) in the White Sea, the site of a fabled monastery. Pilgrims “smelling of cod and incense” throw bread to gulls from the stern of the steamer. I made that trip in 2014, setting off from Kem, on the western shore of the White Sea, and the pilgrims were still tossing food to the gulls. By then the sacred Solovki had taken on a meaning of nightmare: The monastery was the site of one of the first gulags.</td>
