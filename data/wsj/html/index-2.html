      <td>.<br />Kimberly Owens doesn’t know if retirement will ever be a reality for her. A well-educated project coordinator in her late 40s, she has pulled from her retirement funds for emergencies twice in 20 years. Her 401(k) balance is in the low-five figures.<br />“I’m going to be working until I am 75 at this rate,” said Ms. Owens, who works for the New Haven, Conn., campus of a medical-device company. ”I’m not anywhere close to where I thought I was going to be at this point in my life.”<br />Many American households aren’t prepared for retirement, but Black Americans like Ms. Owens are even further behind than whites, according to academic and government data. The recent economic turmoil is likely widening the disparity.<br />Many Black Americans are hampered in saving for retirement by such factors as less intergenerational wealth, more college debt, lower incomes and lower homeownership rates than white Americans, according to academic and government data.</td>

      <td>Investors are piling into smaller companies and other cyclical stocks as booming market rally continues</td>
      <td>Shares of small companies are outpacing their larger counterparts by the widest margin in more than two decades. Behind their rise: confidence among investors that heavy stimulus and coronavirus vaccine deployment will boost the economy.<br />The Russell 2000 Index of small companies has climbed 15% and set 10 closing records so far this year, well above the S&P 500’s 4% rise. That is the largest such gap between the two indexes through Feb. 19 since 2000, according to Dow Jones Market Data.<br />The leadership by small companies goes back even further. Over the past six months, they are beating the S&P 500 by nearly 30 percentage points as investors anticipate greater fiscal spending from the Biden administration.<br />Among some of the biggest gainers: hydrogen fuel-cell company  Plug Power Inc.,  fast-food chain  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc.  and retailer  Macy’s Inc.  All three stocks have more than doubled in the past six months and are up at least 30% in 2021.<br />Smaller companies are more tied to the domestic economy than their large-cap counterparts, which make more money overseas. Economically sensitive sectors such as energy, materials and banking also account for more of the Russell 2000 than larger indexes. These cyclical groups were battered by the pandemic but are now powering markets to records.</td>

      <td>Attorney general nominee plans to stress the importance of an independent DOJ at his Senate confirmation hearing on Monday</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Judge Merrick Garland, President Biden’s pick for attorney general, is expected to get a bipartisan welcome before the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday, where he will promise to combat a rising threat of domestic extremism and stress the need for an independent Justice Department.<br />The very fact that Judge Garland is getting a hearing itself signals changed times. In 2016, Senate Republicans refused to grant him one after President Barack Obama nominated him for the Supreme Court. Republicans and Democrats alike are hailing the nominee, who spearheaded domestic terrorism investigations for the Justice Department in the 1990s, as expertly qualified both to fight the threat of extremist violence and to restore morale, stability and institutional integrity to a Justice Department roiled by political storms in recent years.<br />The federal judge and former prosecutor will highlight critical tasks that he would take on if confirmed, including overseeing the prosecution of “white supremacists and others” involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to prepared remarks released over the weekend.<br />Judge Garland would also pursue strong enforcement of civil-rights law, citing the Justice Department’s original mission to enforce amendments that provided broader rights and protections for Black Americans that grew out of the Civil War.<br />“That mission remains urgent because we do not yet have equal justice,” he plans to say. “Communities of color and other minorities still face discrimination in housing, education, employment, and the criminal justice system; and bear the brunt of the harm caused by pandemic, pollution, and climate change.”</td>

      <td>Read profiles of leaders navigating the coronavirus pandemic in The Wall Street Journal’s Leadership Lessons From the Covid-19 Crisis, available to download for Journal subscribers.<br />Executives pivoted and experimented and doubled down. They sent workers home, and brought them back again. They held emergency meeting after emergency meeting. They shared their own homes and lives with staff in video calls and personal words. They tried to save the world, through vaccines and bleach wipes or even just getting folks enough toilet paper.<br />This was leading a company in 2020, through the worst crisis most bosses have witnessed in their careers. Working through it was often painful, but there are things we can learn from all of it—the actions of upstarts and veterans, the missteps and failures, and the groundbreaking wins.<br />The Wall Street Journal’s Leadership Lessons From the Covid-19 Crisis, available to download for Journal subscribers, spotlights how leaders adapted to a challenge unprecedented in our modern times, including takeaways from their experiences.<br />The tactics on display include both old-school styles harking back to the days of Jack Welch (see  Emerson Electric ’s  David Farr), and more modern approaches. I’m all for the new wave of empathetic leadership that we’ve seen some executives move toward recently, but these case studies suggest there are circumstances that call for nonstop hours, tough feedback and seemingly impossible goals, as was the case at  Moderna ,  which developed a Covid-19 vaccine. Keep it fair, of course, but when the whole world is watching, and the outcome is literally a matter of life and death, sometimes you need a hard-charging leader pushing you forward.</td>

These seats would be given to some of the more than 200 Hong Kong-resident members of China’s top political advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the people said.<br />The plan is part of sweeping changes presaged by the chief of Beijing’s office on Hong Kong affairs, Xia Baolong, in a speech on Monday in which he said that Hong Kong’s executive, legislature and judiciary must comprise “true patriots.” In his first public speech after taking the office in early 2020, Mr. Xia called anyone who opposes the governments of China or Hong Kong “destroyers” who shouldn’t be able to exert influence in the future.<br />Mr. Xia didn’t specify any proposed electoral changes, but the people familiar with the plans said details of the legislation are being completed ahead of the March 5 opening of the National People’s Congress, China’s legislature. Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who has a low public-approval rating, hasn’t said whether she intends to run for a second five-year term next year.</td>

The benchmark retreated 0.7% last week. Contracts linked to the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 fell 1.3%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid 0.6% lower.<br />Investors are betting that the rollout of vaccines and President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package will accelerate the economic rebound later this year.<br />Those expectations, combined with worries about rising inflation and the prospect of interest rates climbing sooner than anticipated, have contributed to a selloff in U.S. government bonds in recent weeks. Declining bond prices result in rising yields, which have stoked concern that highflying stocks are starting to look less attractive than assets considered to be risk free.<br />“As the yield goes up, there is more demand for [government bonds] in relation to other assets,” said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. “How much are you willing to pay for stocks? If you’re only getting a very low yield from bonds, you should be willing to pay a higher amount for stocks. But that starts to change when bond yields go up.”</td>

Mr. Ryu’s defection in 2019 occurred just two months after Pyongyang’s acting ambassador to Rome, Jo Song Gil, defected to Seoul.<br />The number of recent ambassador-level defections from North Korea shows Kim Jong Un’s control over the regime’s bureaucracy may not be as strong as his father’s or grandfather’s, said Cheon Seong-whun, a former South Korean national security official. However, he cautioned against reading too much into the defections as a sign of the regime’s fragility.<br />“We should be wary of interpreting the series of defections as a sign of weakness of the Kim Jong Un regime,” Mr. Cheon said. Most North Koreans have a tendency to rally around their leader against outside pressure, he said.</td>

Based in Bridgeport, Conn.,based People’s United has a market value of roughly $6.6 billion, while Buffalo, N.Y.-based M&T’s is more than $19 billion.<br />Combined, the banks would have more than $200 billion in assets, with a network of branches concentrated in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions. The deal would facilitate M&T’s expansion into the Boston market and strengthen its position in New York and Connecticut.<br />For M&T, a serial acquirer, it would be its first major takeover since its acquisition of Hudson City Bancorp Inc. in 2015. That deal was delayed for three years after regulators found “significant weaknesses” in M&T’s anti-money-laundering and consumer-compliance programs.<br />M&T is among the largest regional lenders in the Northeast, with $142.6 billion in assets at the end of 2020. Commercial real-estate loans comprise almost 40% of its portfolio, including some to New York City’s battered hospitality sector. But loan performance at the bank, as well as that of many of its regional peers, has been better-than-expected over the past year.</td>

It is one of the largest so-called retail-colocation providers, with its data centers serving and connecting multiple customers and supporting the widespread adoption of hybrid-cloud infrastructure. Demand for data management was already on the rise thanks to the growth of everything from drones to internet-enabled gadgets when remote work and schooling necessitated by Covid-19 gave the sector an additional boost.<br />SPACs, which have exploded in popularity, raise money in an initial public offering and then look for a business to combine with in a deal that gives the target an alternative route to the public markets. The Starboard vehicle raised $360 million when it went public last year. In addition to that, Cyxtera is expected to receive funds raised alongside the merger, as is typical in SPAC deals.</td>

Republican lawmakers are talking about impeachment, but Democrats dismissed their effort as disingenuous.<br />On Thursday, lawmakers from both parties said they would publicly grill State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker over the state’s delay in releasing a fuller tally of nursing-home deaths as well as a controversial March 25 department directive that said nursing homes couldn’t refuse to admit Covid-positive patients.<br />Mr. Cuomo and his aides have responded forcefully to critical lawmakers both recently and over the course of his time in office, and the governor said on Friday that he would be more aggressive in addressing critics of his actions on nursing homes. Dr. Zucker said the March 25 directive was consistent with federal guidance at the time and was necessary to preserve hospital capacity.<br />But pressure tactics that normally happen in private are bursting into public view and, some legislators said, have only steeled their positions.</td>

      <td>His administration appears to have engaged in a coverup to frustrate federal oversight.</td>
      <td>The Cuomo administration’s alleged misreporting of nursing-home deaths in New York is serious, perhaps meriting federal criminal charges.<br />On March 25, 2020, Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order requiring New York nursing homes to admit hospitalized patients who had tested positive for Covid-19. The order also prohibited nursing homes from requiring hospitalized residents deemed “medically stable” to be tested before admission or readmission. By the end of the summer New York had more than 32,000 Covid deaths, the highest in the nation and more than double any other state. If New York were its own country, it would have ranked among the top 10 for Covid deaths. The number of deaths translated to the country’s second-highest death rate—more than three times the national average.<br />What caught the Justice Department’s eye was Gov. Cuomo’s claim that New York’s nursing-home deaths were lower than many other states’ and that his March 25 order didn’t contribute to the extremely high number of New Yorkers who died from Covid. Given the virus’s disproportionate effect on the elderly, sick and frail, this seemed unlikely. On Aug. 26, Justice’s Civil Rights Division, relying on its jurisdiction to investigate government-run facilities under the federal Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, asked the Cuomo administration for data on New York’s publicly run nursing homes, which account for less than 5% of nursing homes in the state.<br />In September, New York produced data showing it had underreported Covid deaths in government-run nursing homes by a third. The undercounting appeared to be due to several factors. First, when a nursing-home resident who contracted Covid died after being transported to a hospital for treatment, New York didn’t count it as a “nursing-home death.” Second, New York didn’t include deaths occurring before the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began requiring Covid reporting from nursing homes in mid-May. CMS made reporting prior Covid deaths optional, and New York apparently elected to keep the information to itself.<br />But New York officials knew the data they reported to CMS only went back to mid-May. The Cuomo administration misled the public when it relied on that data to claim in late September that the state’s total nursing-home deaths were low.</td>

      <td>Since February 2020, the M2 supply has increased 26%—the largest one-year jump since 1943.</td>
      <td>Speculative manias are in the air, as evidenced by the recent price surges for bitcoin, a digital asset with a fundamental value of zero, and  GameStop ,  a declining retailer. Along with the other economic trends—a strong recovery, surging commodity prices and an uptick in inflation—those asset bubbles have a clear cause: the massive expansion of money and credit.<br />Yet America’s fiscal and monetary masters are turning a blind eye. They are focused solely on mending the labor market. With the fervor of messiahs, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen tell us the only way to save the labor market and reach full employment is to continue to pour fiscal and monetary fuel on the fire. But their prescriptions and prophecies, modeled on the playbook of the 2008 financial crisis, are not valid today.<br />After that crisis, the Fed began quantitative easing, which massively expanded its balance sheet. At the same time, commercial banks were busy shrinking their loan books and writing off losses from mortgage debt and securities, which meant the Fed’s injections did little more than offset the contraction of commercial bank balance sheets. As a result, money growth from 2010-19, as measured by the Fed’s broadest money measure, M2, averaged only 5.8% a year.<br />While money on the Fed’s books grew rapidly, money in the hands of the public grew slowly. Spending and inflation were restrained, and the postcrisis recovery was anemic with inflation persistently below the Fed’s target. In contrast, China’s money-supply growth exploded in 2009 and 2010, averaging 23% a year. China achieved a strong recovery as a result, but also a jump in inflation, which moved from minus 1.8% in July 2009 to 6.5% by July 2011. Money matters.<br />Fast-forward to February 2020. Since then, the quantity of money in the U.S. economy, measured by M2, has increased by an astonishing $4 trillion. That’s a one-year increase of 26%—the largest annual percentage increase since 1943.</td>

      <td>Companies won’t make permanent investments in new employees based on temporary revenue.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration says if Congress passes the proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill, we won’t have to “wait for years for the economy to return to full employment,” as two members of the Council of Economic Advisers put it in a recent White House blog post.<br />It’s the right goal. In April 2017, the unemployment rate dipped below what the Congressional Budget Office projected as full employment. It stayed there until the pandemic. That created intense competition for employees and drove wage growth at or above 3% for 20 consecutive pre-pandemic months. By 2019 median family income hit a record high, the poverty rate declined to a record low, and income inequality decreased for the second year in a row.<br />The jobs picture is all but certain to improve in a year when people are getting vaccinated and states are opening their economies. The labor market will improve in the coming months if the government does nothing. But massive spending will hurt more than it helps.<br />Business owners recognize that government spending can put more money into circulation and may result in increased sales. But they also know that government largess—no matter how generous—is finite. If you believe a revenue source is going to dry up, you don’t invest in growth and hiring based on its continuing.<br />Say you owned a restaurant and sales increased because your competitor next door burned down, but he had insurance and would rebuild. You’d certainly appreciate the increased sales, but you wouldn’t hire more permanent employees, because you know the increased revenue is temporary.</td>

Greg Abbott’s decision last week to ban natural-gas exports to Mexico temporarily was shortsighted and counterproductive for his state.<br />This isn’t to dismiss the suffering in Texas. But Northern Mexico, which was also in the deep freeze, is the Lone Star State’s largest trading partner and its biggest market for natural-gas exports. Trying to use a state edict to cut off Mexican power generators in a crisis was a public admission that in Texas’s eyes, customers south of the border don’t rate.<br />As the cold snap ends, gas exports will resume and life will go on as before for Texas gas suppliers. But Mr. Abbott has handed Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador a cudgel with which to beat Mexico’s economic liberals, who opened energy markets to private investment and trade in 2014. It is their fault, AMLO argues, that Mr. Abbott has the power to leave them shivering in the dark.<br />This claim is nowhere near the truth—I’ll get to that in a minute—but AMLO used it last week to launch a new blitzkrieg against energy competition, foreign and domestic, in Mexico. The world-class demagogue from Tabasco, who thrives on nationalism, now has the bit in his mouth. Over time it could cost Texas gas suppliers.<br />The Abbott decree was likely not even legal. “Force majeure” clauses in contracts might allow the interruption of shipments due to an act of God. But a governor doesn’t have jurisdiction to shut down international trade unilaterally.</td>

      <td>Even when TV was a ‘vast wasteland,’ it brought us together.</td>
      <td>Newton Minow famously called television a “vast wasteland”: “a procession of game shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, western bad men, western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons. And endlessly, commercials. . . . And most of all, boredom.”<br />That was 60 years ago. Today the options are far more vast, and many of them are of high quality. But we’ve lost something: With so many viewing options, TV is no longer America’s great common denominator.<br />In 1961, when Mr. Minow became chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the three most-watched television programs were westerns: “Wagon Train,” “Bonanza” and “Gunsmoke.” Each was seen weekly by roughly 1 in 3 Americans. Wasteland or not, it was part of a sweeping shared experience.<br />When I looked at Nielsen’s top 10 list of most-viewed series for 2020, I was surprised to discover that I had watched only three—and two of them were NFL football. My editor at the Journal had seen only the same three. (The third was the NBC drama “This Is Us.”) Neither of us has watched the two most popular scheduled nonsports series, the  CBS  crime dramas “NCIS,” with a 5.0 rating, and “FBI,” with 4.2. The numbers represent the percentage of homes with television that tuned in. In 1961 the rating for “Gunsmoke” was 37.3.<br />The issue isn’t whether cop shows are aesthetically better than cowboy shows. And it’s not as if Americans are watching less TV; in fact, adults view 4 hours and 8 minutes of television every day, according to Nielsen. When you add in other forms of “video time,” the total jumps to nearly 6 hours. (The pandemic drove up the number by about 35 minutes a day.)</td>

      <td>The pioneer of head-transplant surgery believed that the soul resides in the brain and could be rescued from physically compromised bodies.</td>
      <td>The “title characters” of Brandy Schillace’s admirable biography “Mr. Humble and Dr. Butcher: A Monkey’s Head, the Pope’s Neuroscientist, and the Quest to Transplant the Soul” were one and the same person: Robert J. White, a distinguished neurosurgeon, an accomplished neuroscientist and a man dedicated to searching for the means to transplant souls by transplanting the human brain. If this makes White sound macabre, Ms. Schillace’s account of his life, work and temperament is anything but. She deftly persuades the reader to take White seriously (he wasn’t even eccentric) and to ponder profound medical-scientific-philosophical issues. Best of all, the book is fascinating.<br />White (1926-2010)—blue-collar, middle-class, born in Duluth, Minn.—was, in many ways, a model American. He enlisted in the Army during World War II and served in the medical corps. Afterward he received a full scholarship to Harvard Medical School and in 1953 graduated with full honors. He subsequently enrolled in the University of Minnesota’s neuroscience program and completed his Ph.D. In 1961 he moved with his family (he and his wife would have 10 children) to Cleveland, where he founded the neurosurgery department and brain-research lab at Metropolitan General Hospital.<br />White’s contribution to mainstream medicine was groundbreaking and enduring. He played a seminal role in the medical use of “localized hypothermic cerebral perfusion”—putting the brain on ice, so to speak, to provide surgeons with the necessary time to repair it. Perfusion is now commonplace—it is also used in cardiac surgery—and has saved the lives of countless individuals who would otherwise have died. By the end of his life, White, a superb surgeon, had operated thousands of times, was loved by his patients and their families, advised two popes on bioethical matters, had written hundreds of articles and won numerous honors. He thought it important to make himself available to the press (perhaps too available: one headline read “Monkeys Help Doctor Get ‘Ahead’ ”) and popular culture (he was a consultant on the 2008 movie “X-Files: I Want to Believe”).<br />But Ms. Schillace didn’t write this book to chronicle the life of a routinely establishment physician. Even as a young man, White, a devout Catholic, was convinced that the soul was located in the brain, what the author describes as “three pounds of gelatinous convolutions and a hundred billion nerves.” White felt it was his religious and medical duty to devise techniques for rescuing healthy brains from otherwise diseased and dying bodies. His solution was to transplant heads (containing their brains) onto cadavers that were brain dead but otherwise physiologically viable.<br />Before he could attempt such surgery on people, White experimented, mostly on monkeys, dozens of times, to ascertain and refine the necessary procedures. In March 1970 he succeeded in transplanting a monkey’s head onto another monkey’s body. (A warning: Ms. Schillace’s descriptions of surgery are very detailed.) The transported head didn’t survive long, but the important thing for White was that sensors revealed electrical impulses emanating from the resettled brain. White believed that only brain death—the cessation of the brain’s electrical signals—meant true death. Therefore the monkey whose head was relocated, while its brain was still active, was, in White’s opinion, actually alive. He couldn’t wait to start on human transplants.</td>

      <td>Mayo Clinic, like many health providers, has been pushed to its limits by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its intensive-care units were often filled to or near capacity in 2020. And while doctors throughout the health system rushed to find ways to care for the wave of sick patients infected by the new virus, many of the medical and support staff were being sent home to work remotely.<br />The information-technology team led by Mayo Clinic Chief Information Officer Cris Ross faced immense challenges. Practically overnight, remote, secure and fast access to multiple systems had to be provided to thousands of workers, including doctors. The influx of Covid patients, meanwhile, needed to be able to communicate with the outside world while being kept in isolation. And it all had to be done on the fly. Adapting the healthcare system’s networks and building new tools to meet these demands required planning, decisions and execution at speeds undreamed of a short time before.<br />Mr. Ross spoke to The Wall Street Journal about his IT department’s efforts to support Mayo’s staff and how the pandemic is changing the way his team provides IT to the organization. Here are edited excerpts of the discussion.<br />WSJ: What was the biggest lesson you learned?<br />MR. ROSS: Sometimes we have an expectation that if we’re going to make a change, it’s going to take months and months—that we have to step slowly and carefully. But with the pandemic, we were forced to make decisions in weeks or days. We’ve discovered that when necessity requires rapid decisions and fast action, we can do it.</td>

      <td>The U.S. officially rejoined the Paris climate accord on Friday to much media and European applause. Our guess is that China is the most pleased because it knows the accord will restrict American energy while Beijing gets a decade-long free ride.<br />Paris is a voluntary agreement, and nations submit their own commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. The Obama Administration vowed to slash emissions 26% or more from 2005 levels by 2025, but the Trump Administration withdrew from the accord. President Biden has now pledged to reach “net-zero emissions no later than 2050.”<br />Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Biden is committing the U.S. without submitting the Paris agreement to the Senate as a treaty. They know it would never get a two-thirds vote for approval, and probably not even a simple majority. Yet the Administration will cite Paris to justify sweeping environmental regulations to raise the cost of fossil fuels and subsidize renewable energy and electric vehicles. It will bypass Congress for much of this.<br />The economic damage will be real. A 2017 analysis of the Obama Paris commitments, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Council for Capital Formation, predicted a $250 billion reduction in GDP and some 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025.<br />Meanwhile, China emitted nearly twice as much CO2 as the U.S. in 2018. Yet under Paris, Beijing gets a pass to increase its emissions until 2030. In 2020 China’s coal plants produced some 4,874 terawatt hours of energy—an increase of nearly 15% since it joined the pact, according to S&P Global Platts.</td>

And as Mr. Galston pertinently points out, the only purge which is coming to pass, albeit thus far on the state level, is that of those isolated Republicans who voted to convict.<br />Clearly those Trump-fatigue-afflicted Republicans who see President Trump as a radioactive force within the GOP aren’t reading the tea leaves properly. They can take solace in the fact that the Great Disrupter’s last disruptive act, unlike so many of his others, hardly put America first. “Character is destiny,” said Heraclitus. Yet despite that domestic day of infamy, he’ll undoubtedly be the party’s kingmaker now, though it’s an open question whether he could rise like a phoenix to become the party’s standard-bearer again.<br />One thing is certain: With President Biden in the White House doing the radical Democrats’ bidding on every front, one can readily envision a redux of Trumpism in 2024, sans the sizzling melodrama of its progenitor.<br />James Hyland<br />Beechhurst, N.Y.</td>

      <td>“Car Makers Collide With Global Chip Shortage” (Page One, Feb. 13) correctly identifies the auto industry’s current supply-chain woes as a self-inflicted wound. From the electronics-manufacturing industry’s point of view, automotive is mostly a low-volume, high-mix customer segment, and it requires buffering through component distributors. Instead, the auto makers’ extreme focus on cost optimization and lean manufacturing meant eliminating these valuable supply-chain partners. The focus on lean should have been balanced with a pragmatic view on the extreme cost of idled automotive production lines. To shut down production lines for $80,000 vehicles because of a missing $2 microcontroller is catastrophic.<br />Products like semiconductors that have longer lead times and large production lot sizes need distribution for efficient buffering between the manufacturers and end customers. Semiconductors have extremely long and complex production cycles that can range from 10 to 26 weeks. Once a production cycle is begun, large quantities of the same product flow in lots through a semiconductor-manufacturing line that pop out at the end in a burst. Highest volume customers (e.g., smartphone manufacturers) can efficiently receive product directly from a manufacturer. For lower volume, high-mix customers like automotive and industrial, distributors buffer inventory to match a customer’s demand for a steady flow of product to the long production cycles of semiconductor manufacturing and also provide many value-added services.<br />The collaboration between authorized distributors and automotive manufacturers presents a wealth of opportunity to minimize future disruptions.<br />David Loftus<br />President and CEO</td>

      <td>Regarding your editorial “Emmanuel Macron and the Woke” (Feb. 18): While I welcome French President Macron’s apparent opposition to “wokeness,” far from restoring “classical liberal values,” he is forcing through a law that effectively renders home schooling illegal for most parents. Just as the German government in 1938 threatened parents with prison if they did not send their children to school from age 6, France will soon require all children from age 3 to attend school or else. Few truly independent options exist, as even the Catholic schools follow the state curriculum with full state funding.<br />Defenders of the law reiterate the view of French revolutionary Georges Danton in 1793 that children belong not first to their parents but to the state. MPs have acknowledged that they know they are taking away a fundamental right by seeking to make home schooling very difficult, but they forge ahead despite all evidence that this move is disproportionate and unnecessary to combat Islamic radicalism. The current law, which includes an in-home inspection of home-schooled children each year, is amply sufficient for detecting any madrasa-style “home schooling.” Having cited ad nauseam the example of 15 children found being radicalized, half of whom were registered as “home-schooled,” the government unjustly tars all 62,000 home-schooled children in France with the same brush.<br />The architects of recent terrorist attacks overwhelmingly have been products of the French (or Belgian) school system, none of them home-schooled. Mr. Macron’s totalitarian instincts are as troubling as those of the jihadists.<br />Priscilla Larkin Harris<br />Ghlin, Belgium</td>

      <td>The recent hearing on Robinhood missed the basics of how pump-and-dumps work.</td>
      <td>Michael J. Meehan and friends started buying a tech company’s shares, but from each other, driving up the price on each trade. Others noticed the rising stock and started buying too, sending shares to more than $100. Then everyone piled in until it hit around $500 at its peak. Sound familiar?  GameStop ? AMC? Nope. It was RCA, pumped by the so-called Radio Pool in 1928-29.<br />Pump-and-dump schemes and roving gangs of investors are an age-old problem. In the 1930s, Congress made these stock pools illegal. Problem solved, right? Ha ha, sure—just like last week’s Roaring Kitty congressional hearings will “fix” the latest iteration. To be fair, RCA was successful and radios really were the future. No matter, after the crash the stock hit $10.<br />For a pump and dump to work, you need a certain type of investor—specifically, the type P.T. Barnum said is born every minute (on platforms like Reddit and Robinhood, more like every nanosecond). To be nice, let’s call them dupes. “Greater fools” works too.<br />On Feb. 2, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy tweeted, “I have officially sold all my meme stocks. I lost 700kish. Vlad and company stole it from me and should be in jail”—Vlad Tenev being the founder of the stock-trading app Robinhood. Let me gently suggest what he meant to tweet: “Robinhood limited trading of GameStop and AMC so even bigger fools from Reddit couldn’t bid up the price further and let me dump my shares on them.”<br />Here are a few things Congress missed:</td>

      <td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sidestepped questions over whether his country agreed to pay Russia to provide coronavirus vaccines to Syria as a part of a prisoner swap between the two Middle Eastern countries.<br />Mr. Netanyahu confirmed Saturday night that negotiations with Russia took place as part of efforts to bring back an Israeli woman stuck in Syria. He said he had spoken twice with Russian President Vladimir Putin to hammer out the deal, but denied that Israel provided its own vaccines for it.<br />“I want to say that not even one Israeli vaccine went for this thing,” said Mr. Netanyahu. “We brought back the woman. I’m happy we did this. I thank President Putin that we did this. And more than this I won’t add because that was the Russian request.”<br />The deal was first reported by a U.S.-based blogger, Richard Silverstein, and the  New York Times ,  who said that Israel secretly agreed to pay Russia to send vaccines to Syria to secure the return of the Israeli woman.<br />Israel has described the exchange as a standard prisoner swap. The prime minister didn’t deny buying the Russian vaccines, however, and a person familiar with the deal said that was part of the arrangement.</td>

      <td>International investigators ignore the lab-leak theory but investigate frozen fish.</td>
      <td>Chinese policy makers have been floating an implausible theory: The novel coronavirus didn’t originate in China but was imported from Europe. That’s what a former chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention told an academic conference last fall. One theory is the virus rode into Wuhan on frozen-food packaging.<br />This month the World Health Organization visited China to investigate the origins of the virus. A member of the WHO delegation said it's “possible that a frozen carcass could have been shipped” to China and introduced the virus, giving some validation to the food-packaging idea. Reporting has suggested that China required the WHO to agree it would investigate the food hypothesis as a condition of entering Wuhan. By lending credence to this improbable theory, WHO is damaging trust in the important project of figuring out where the virus originated.<br />The most common culprit cited by Chinese officials is frozen salmon, though officials have also suggested the virus may have hitched a ride on frozen cod, pig heads or other products. In response, Beijing has suspended imports of some food products and introduced inspections and tests of frozen food, which has frequently held up imports from the U.S. and Europe.<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration weighed in last week with a forceful statement. “There is no credible evidence of food or food packaging associated with or as a likely source of viral transmission,” the Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcocksaid in a Covid update on Thursday.<br />Other scientific bodies have reached similar conclusions. The International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods has stated: “Despite the billions of meals and food packages handled since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, to date there has not been any evidence that food, food packaging or food handling is a source or important transmission route.” More than 100 million cases of Covid have been diagnosed world-wide and, outside China, not a single case has been traced to food or food packaging.</td>

      <td>The State Department in a report to Congress didn’t name new companies as targets for sanctions related to an $11 billion pipeline designed to transmit Russian natural gas to Germany, allowing work on the pipeline to continue unabated for now.<br />Some Republican lawmakers criticized the State Department over the Nord Stream 2 report, which was required by Congress, and both Republicans and a key Democrat requested an explanation of the administration’s position.<br />The Trump administration, urged by Congress, signed laws in 2019 and 2020 that halted the pipeline’s construction for more than a year until its resumption earlier this month. The Biden administration has called the project a “bad deal,” but Nord Stream 2 is shaping into a pressure point between the new administration and a bipartisan Congressional coalition that has assailed the project.<br />The report was expected to provide a list of companies involved in pipeline construction and are therefore subject to U.S. sanctions. Instead, the State Department named two entities previously sanctioned by the Trump administration—the main pipe-laying vessel and its owner—along with 18 companies, mostly insurers, that already have left or were leaving the project.<br />The failure to name any new targets for sanctions allows the work to continue while also providing the administration with time for discussions with Germany about the project and to formulate its own policy on the pipeline.</td>

Companies considering opening additional offices and dedicated to more hiring diversity can bridge this gap by locating new facilities in areas where there are a large concentration of Black workers who have the relevant skills.”<br />McKinsey studied detailed employment data for more than 3,000 U.S. counties and cross-referenced it with internal corporate data and interviews inside companies. What emerges is a comprehensive picture of Black representation in corporate America—and the challenges that remain for both workers and organizations.<br />Mr. Manyika recently spoke with The Wall Street Journal.

Commercial activity largely sputtered to a halt. “For Rent” signs have proliferated on the once-bustling seaside avenues of this city.<br />The opening up and use of what officials are calling green passports, which allow people to enter gyms and hotels and eventually embark on quarantine-free travel, set up a test for one of the most closely watched countries during the pandemic: Can Israel return to relative normalcy without slipping back into peak infection rates and overwhelming its healthcare system?<br />To strike that balance, officials are warning those who shun the national vaccination campaign that they will be shut out of everyday activities. “Anyone who does not get vaccinated will be left behind,” Israel’s health minister Yuli Edelstein said.</td>

      <td>Conventional wisdom says the best time to go to business school is in your 20s, after working a few years, perhaps while you are still single and trying to move up in the corporate world.<br />Some M.B.A. students beg to differ. In fact, the experiences of graduates with untraditional or non-business backgrounds show that the degree can help mid-career individuals parlay expertise in areas such as science or the military into business leadership. It also can help in the transition from the public to the private sector at any age.<br />Many M.B.A. programs have sought candidates from different backgrounds in recent years, especially as businesses look to hire a more diverse workforce. Schools have said that waiving their standardized-test requirements, including the GMAT exam, for this year removes a hurdle for untraditional students. Some top programs also have plans to diversify applicant pipelines.<br />In 2020, the percentage of two-year M.B.A. applicants with six or more years of work experience increased to 32% from 17% in 2019, according to the nonprofit Graduate Management Admission Council. The share of candidates with 10 or more years of experience rose to 19% from 7% a year ago.<br />Applications to M.B.A. programs, in general, soared this past year as students from a variety of backgrounds sought places to ride out the pandemic-induced recession. Students typically flock to business schools and other graduate programs during economic downturns to sit out a tough job market and gain credentials. M.B.A. program applications had fallen for five straight years because of a hot job market and high tuition costs.</td>

      <td>GameStop  mania has spilled over into a popular exchange-traded fund, as the WallStreetBets craze reaches beyond shares favored on social media.<br />The fund,  State Street ’s  SPDR S&P Retail ETF, was created in 2006 to give investors broad exposure to mall-store firms. Its shares have surged 23% this year, far outstripping a 4% gain in the S&P 500, despite the uncertain outlook for retail. Behind those gains are the traders who congregate on social-media platforms such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum and whose enthusiasm has turned this mundane investment into a roller coaster.<br />On Jan. 27, GameStop soared 135%, driven by events such as Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeting “Gamestonk.” The State Street fund jumped 42% the same day. The next day, GameStop shares tumbled 44% and the fund, known by its ticker XRT, dropped about 9%.<br />On Jan. 28, the fund suffered its largest single-day outflow in more than a decade, according to FactSet. Three-quarters of the money in the fund flowed out, amounting to $506 million in redemptions, driven in part by what some analysts describe as a frantic rush by traders to liquidate the ETF—whose price at times traded at discounts rarely seen in this part of the world—to get their hands on underlying GameStop shares.<br />The whipsaw trading highlights how the mania in WallStreetBets favorites like GameStop can drive pricing in other investments, in this case one typically preferred by investors seeking portfolio diversification and targeted exposure to industry sectors. GameStop shares, long viewed as an also-ran by many investors in a world dominated by  Amazon  and  Costco ,  at one point this year accounted for 20% of the State Street fund.</td>

Stuck near historic lows for most of last year, Treasury yields have climbed in recent months along with investors’ expectations for a strong economic rebound, driven in part by more debt-financed government spending.<br />Rising yields, which result from falling bond prices, often reflect investors’ expectations of faster growth and an accompanying rise in inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of bonds’ fixed payments and can eventually lead the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. More government borrowing also can boost yields by increasing the supply of bonds. Though many investors are keeping an eye on inflation data, analysts and portfolio managers say so far there is little reason to believe price levels will rise enough to prompt the Fed to raise rates any time soon, which looms as perhaps the greatest risk to major stock indexes.<br />“The market has principally been saying, ‘Hooray, the pandemic is coming under control and the economy is starting to grow again,’” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, an investment adviser and brokerage firm. “But now we’re actually starting to see the consequences of that in the form of higher rates, and I think the market’s processing that.”<br />As of Friday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note stood at 1.344%, up from 1.157% just five trading sessions earlier and roughly 0.9% at the start of the year.</td>

And District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine, a Democrat, “is investigating whether former President Trump or any other individual violated district law and illegally incited violence on Jan. 6,” according to a spokeswoman, though his authority is more limited.<br />Prosecutors would face clear challenges in bringing any case, according to former prosecutors and experts.<br />Tom Firestone, a lawyer with Baker & McKenzie LLP and former assistant U.S. attorney in New York, said prosecutors would have to consider several factors, including whether Mr. Trump was engaged in constitutionally protected political speech or instead crossed a line that prompted supporters to commit violence. “If you look at his speech, there’s evidence that both sides could use,” Mr. Firestone said.<br />Other important considerations would include Mr. Trump’s intent, what he knew about his supporters’ intentions, and whether the attack on the Capitol was reasonably foreseeable under the circumstances. “I think all of these factors would make it a difficult prosecution, though not an impossible one,” Mr. Firestone said.</td>

Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal may have come of age as generational rivals, captivating the sport, and harnessing much of its good will, but as the years go on, and bodies weary, it may be Djokovic—the third man in, and a historic talent himself—who stands alone.<br />On Sunday, Djokovic won the Australian Open men’s final, his 18th major tournament victory, rolling over Daniil Medvedev 7-5, 6-2, 6-2, putting him two majors behind Federer and Nadal, who both have 20. At 33, Djokovic is about a year younger than Nadal, and more than six years younger than Federer, who will be 40 when the U.S. Open rolls around in late summer. Djokovic owns lifetime winning records against both—he’s 29-27 against Nadal, 27-23 against Federer.<br />Nothing should be assumed in tennis—injuries can happen at any time, and the mental stress of an individual, globe-circling sport isn’t insignificant. Great players can and have suddenly walked away. It will be interesting to see what condition Federer is in when he returns this spring, after nearly a year away, recuperating from a knee injury, and if there’s a chance he can add a couple more. There’s part of me that thinks Nadal could keep dropping in and winning the French Open into his late 30s and early 40s, like some kind of clay-court version of Tom Brady—or better yet, in the way the aging golfer Fred Couples stays relevant at Augusta, because he knows the joint so well.<br />But if Djokovic continues to power along, staying healthy, he may soon be atop the major mountaintop.<br />“The question that comes out of this match is simple,” John McEnroe said on ESPN after Djokovic prevailed Sunday. “Is he going to be the greatest player that ever lived, or is it going to be Roger or Rafa?”</td>

Now, with vaccine rollouts delayed in some places and new virus strains appearing, it is looking more likely that international travel could be stalled for years.<br />After declaring that 2020 was the worst year for tourism on record, with one billion fewer international arrivals, the United Nations World Tourism Organization says prospects for a 2021 rebound have worsened. In October, 79% of experts polled by the agency believed a 2021 rebound was possible. Only 50% said they believed that in January, and some 41% didn’t think travel would reach pre-pandemic levels until 2024 or beyond.<br />James Sowane, who owns a transportation company catering to tourists in Fiji, called a staff meeting earlier this month and told employees to start looking for other jobs. He recently took advantage of a government-assistance program and had brought back some laid-off workers, optimistic that vaccines could spark a travel rebound as early as April.<br />But now Mr. Sowane doesn’t think tourists will return until next year, and he and his wife can’t afford to keep paying wages at their company, Pacific Destinations Fiji. He is borrowing from his bank to keep a few core employees.</td>

Those trends have pushed many miners to expand into the metals used to make batteries, such as lithium, cobalt, graphite and nickel.<br />The last big secular change Mr. Davis said he bet on was China in 2002, when he became chief executive of Xstrata. Driven by a belief that resources like coal, copper and zinc would be in demand as China developed, he helped transform the small Switzerland-based miner via a string of deals into a more than $50 billion giant.</td>

Deep into the second decade of his career, the Australian Open still feels like home.<br />Melbourne was where Djokovic won his first Grand Slam tournament in 2008 and on Sunday, it’s where he clinched the 18th of his career, cruising to a 7-5, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Daniil Medvedev of Russia in Rod Laver Arena. He now trails Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal by just two for the men’s all-time Slam record.<br />“We’re talking about some cyborgs of tennis,” Medvedev said. “In a good way.”<br />The emphatic win gave Djokovic, 33, an unparalleled ninth Australian Open title in 17 visits to the tournament that he has always called his favorite. He has never lost there in a final. Only Nadal has a more intimate relationship with a single major, winning Roland-Garros a mind-boggling 13 times.</td>

      <td>Data may mean a second dose of the vaccine is unnecessary, potentially freeing up limited supply</td>
      <td>Covid-19 survivors who have gotten a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine are generating immune responses that might render a second shot unnecessary, potentially freeing up limited vaccine supply for more people, several new research papers suggest.<br />The research, while preliminary, found that the previously infected people generated protection against the disease quickly and at dramatically higher levels after a first shot of the current two-shot regimens when compared with people who were vaccinated but hadn’t been sick.<br />“Everyone should get vaccinated. Not everybody needs two shots,” said Viviana Simon, a professor of microbiology at New York’s Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and an author on one study. “As long as we can’t deliver as much vaccine to everybody who wants it, I think it’s an important consideration.”<br />The research, which has been posted on preprint servers but not peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal, comes as other findings into the two-shot regimen to healthy members of the general population highlight immune benefits after the first injection. On Friday, researchers in Israel reported a single shot of the vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  is 85% effective in preventing symptomatic disease 15 to 28 days after being administered.<br />Late-stage clinical trials of two-dose vaccines by Pfizer and BioNTech, as well as  Moderna Inc.,  have shown their shots to be safe and highly protective against Covid-19 when given through two doses spaced several weeks apart. However, Pfizer’s trial excluded individuals with symptomatic Covid-19, and Moderna’s left out people with a previously known infection, prompting researchers to see how immune systems in people previously sick responded.</td>

But in recent decades, prices have often climbed much faster for investment assets, such as homes and stocks, and twice led to booms and busts followed by recessions.<br />If the Fed does run into problems with the low interest rates it has helped to engineer, it might be because of asset prices and not consumer prices.</td>

They have been touted by investment bankers as an easier way for startups to go public. If a SPAC fails to find a merger target by a deadline, typically two years, investors could take their money back.<br />As of Feb. 18, eight SPACs sponsored by companies in Asia raised a total of $2.3 billion this year, according to Dealogic data. The sum is small relative to what has been raised by American companies, but it already surpassed the total raised from SPACs in the region for all of 2020. Bankers say more issuances are likely, including from private-equity groups.<br />“This is a compelling pocket of capital that all the large private-equity and venture firms in Asia will be considering,” said Udhay Furtado, co-head of Asia equity capital markets at  Citigroup Inc.</td>

After successfully pumping out direct-to-video sequels to beloved classics like “Bambi” and “The Lion King,” Mr. Chapek sensed an opportunity with “Air Bud,” a 1997 hit film about a basketball-playing dog.<br />DVDs of the “Air Bud” universe proliferated for 10 sequels and spinoffs released between 1998 and 2013. “Space Buddies,” “Seventh Inning Fetch,” “Snow Buddies” and other titles earned millions for the company. Though nearly all the “Disney Buddies” films were released straight to home video, Mr. Chapek spent extra on orchestral scores, elaborate marketing campaigns and other embellishments usually reserved for major theatrical releases.<br />Today, the same instincts are benefiting Mr. Chapek as he shepherds Disney’s transition into the streaming age. Much as he did then, Mr. Chapek today must navigate considerable disruption and bridge the old—a library of classic films, TV shows and franchises—with the new: a streaming service considered by Wall Street to be the lifeblood and future of the world’s largest entertainment company.<br />“Everything he’s doing are things that we did, only in the home-entertainment area,” said Robert Vince, chief executive of Air Bud Entertainment and a producer on all of the “Buddies” films.</td>

      <td>A well-meaning social-media campaign to free young women kidnapped by Boko Haram galvanized rescue efforts—and may have spurred the jihadist group to expand its use of gender violence</td>
      <td>On the evening of April 14, 2014, a band of gunmen stormed into a girls boarding school in the northeast Nigerian town of Chibok and carried away more than 200 students who had been preparing for their graduation exams. The young women were taken to the remote forest hideout of a little-known Islamist sect named Boko Haram.<br />For weeks, almost no one seemed to notice the students were missing. Then the news went viral on  Twitter ,  prompting some of the world’s most recognizable people—Pope Francis, Kim Kardashian, The Rock, Michelle Obama—to fire off a hashtag that lighted up billions of phones: #BringBackOurGirls. Those four words quickly demonstrated the power of social media to advance a distant cause. The girls became a global priority. To free them, a number of the world’s most powerful countries sent their armed forces, drones, satellites and sophisticated surveillance equipment. And then, just as quickly, Twitter’s hive mind swarmed onto its next viral cause, the Ice Bucket Challenge, and never returned.<br />Yet those few days of tweets lighted a fuse that continues to burn years later. The rescue mission launched in 2014 has quietly and covertly evolved into a military deployment across four West African countries. Nigeria’s military, U.S. diplomats and terrorism specialists still express bewilderment that a short-lived series of tweets so profoundly shaped the conflict with Boko Haram and other jihadist groups, which continue to kidnap children for fame, footsoldiers and ransom.<br />Through hundreds of interviews with officials involved in rescue efforts and 20 of the Chibok girls who won their freedom, we found a yearslong trail of far-ranging yet unintended outcomes that neither the advocates nor the cynics who dismissed the campaign as “slacktivism” could have foreseen.<br />The frenzied international coverage inspired both a race to free the women and a shift in Boko Haram’s tactics. Within months, the group was boasting that it had kidnapped vastly more young women, ransoming some and dispatching others as its first female suicide bombers. “The hashtag unwittingly provided Boko Haram with a road map to use gender violence to further its global brand,” says Nigerian writer Tricia Adaobi Nwaubani, who has interviewed more than 200 of the Chibok families.</td>

At the same time, any statement on a fresh round of moderation provokes some to point out objectionable content that remains. Like any question of editorial or legal judgment, the results are guaranteed to displease someone, somewhere—including Congress, which this week called the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to a hearing on March 25 to discuss misinformation on their platforms.<br />For many services, this has gone beyond a matter of user experience, or growth rates, or even ad revenue. It’s become an existential crisis. While dialing up moderation won’t solve all of a platform’s problems, a look at the current winners and losers suggests that not moderating enough is a recipe for extinction.</td>

A key target: healthcare, a trillion-dollar industry many say is saddled with inefficiencies that some tech advocates say AI could cure.<br />A decade later, reality has fallen short of that promise. IBM is now exploring the sale of Watson Health, a unit whose marquee product was supposed to help doctors diagnose and cure cancer.<br />IBM spent several billion dollars on acquisitions to build up Watson. Former senior IBM executive John Kelly once touted the initiative as a “bet the ranch” move. It didn’t live up to the hype. Watson Health has struggled for market share in the U.S. and abroad and currently isn’t profitable.<br />Alphabet Inc.’s  Google DeepMind unit, which famously developed a Go-playing algorithm that vanquished a champion human player in 2016, later launched several healthcare-related initiatives focused on chronic conditions. It also has lost money in recent years and run into privacy concerns over how health data was being collected.</td>

      <td>A new biography examines the iconic comic-book creator’s legacy including his role in shaping characters like Iron Man and the Hulk</td>
      <td>Stan Lee co-created Iron Man, the Hulk, the X-Men, and other Marvel Comics superheroes who’ve thrilled movie audiences and become pop-culture icons. Or did he?<br />Generations of fans have applauded Mr. Lee as the prime mover behind Marvel’s success—not least because Mr. Lee, who died at the age of 95 in 2018, always said he was. But a new biography suggests Mr. Lee may have claimed more credit than he deserved for creating Marvel’s signature characters, and that the bulk of the credit may belong to the artists with whom he collaborated, notably Jack Kirby, who died in 1994.<br />“The image of Stan as a real-life superhero is just not the case,” said Abraham Riesman, the author of “True Believer: The Rise and Fall of Stan Lee.” The recently published book—for which Mr. Riesman conducted 150-plus interviews, many with people close to Mr. Lee, and delved into his archives and thousands of pages of documents—portrays Mr. Lee as a gifted editor, scriptwriter and promoter who nonetheless overstated his accomplishments.<br />Part of the ambiguity stems from the “Marvel Method” Mr. Lee and his artists used, Mr. Riesman argues. They would have informal discussions to outline a story and its characters, sometimes in bare-bones terms, and then the artist drew the pages, shaping the story and adding or changing elements. Mr. Lee then wrote the characters’ dialogue and narration.<br />The question is how much he contributed in those first discussions when the core concepts for new characters were born. There’s little documentation and no hard evidence that the central ideas came from him, Mr. Riesman said. “It’s just Stan said that he created these characters and people believed him.” And, he notes, Mr. Lee had difficulty coming up with successful ideas after Marvel, which is now owned by Disney.</td>

I teach in the College of Business at Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, and sometimes I’ll bring them to play on the lawn or to chase ducks by the pond. We are not keeping them on an extended basis, like so many of the people in the article, but we try to keep them entertained and having fun. Intermittently this past year, the grandchildren would stay with us for three to five days to give their parents a break. After reading the article, I was impressed by the people who would pick up and move across the country and retire just so they can help their children with the grandkids. That’s an extraordinary commitment. I’m genuinely grateful for my children and grandchildren but I don’t know if I’d be able to do that, especially since my wife and I still have our full-time jobs.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Employees of big technology firms were a key source of contributions for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, newly released campaign finance records show, eclipsing donations from employees at traditional Democratic fundraising sources such as banks and law firms.<br />Employees of Google’s parent,  Alphabet Inc.,  and  Microsoft Corp. ,  Amazon.com  Inc.,   Apple Inc.  and  Facebook Inc.  were the five largest sources of money for Mr. Biden’s campaign and joint fundraising committees among those identifying corporate employers, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of campaign finance reports.<br />Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign received at least $15.1 million from employees of those five tech firms, records show. The companies declined to comment.<br />The previous Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama also received large contributions from tech company employees, but their top sources of employee donations extended beyond the tech sector.<br />Mrs. Clinton’s biggest sources of funds from those identifying corporate employers in 2016 included employees of the personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan and  JPMorgan Chase  & Co., along with Google, Microsoft and Apple, according to election records compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.</td>

      <td>In rural Campeche, some are furious the government inoculated teachers—a key voting bloc—ahead of nearly half the state’s health workers</td>
      <td>CAMPECHE, Mexico—In recent weeks, thousands of public school teachers lined up outside schools and hospitals in this southern state as navy helicopters buzzed overhead carrying a precious shipment sent exclusively for them by Mexico’s president: Covid-19 vaccines.<br />The government’s own guidelines call for front-line hospital workers and seniors in Mexico’s hard-hit cities to get jabbed first. But teachers in rural Mexico are a key voting bloc.<br />Critics of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador say vaccinating teachers ahead of all doctors is the latest evidence of how the leftist president is playing politics with vaccinations in a country with the third-highest official Covid-19 death toll in the world, close to 180,000. And instead of having state health workers leading the effort, per usual protocol, Mr. López Obrador’s administration is using officials from its welfare arm, “Servants of the Nation,” recognizable by the vests they wear with Mexico’s national emblem.<br />Campeche is one of several key states that hold midterm elections in June. Polls show that Mr. López Obrador’s Morena party has a chance to unseat the former ruling PRI, which has ruled Campeche since the late 1920s. While many countries have made teachers a priority for vaccination programs during the coronavirus pandemic, they aren’t usually ahead of healthcare workers.<br />Inside hospitals, healthcare workers have been furious that the government was inoculating teachers while nearly half of the state’s doctors and nurses were still waiting.</td>

But Ms. Parker’s heart sank when she read a comment beneath the picture: “I can’t even imagine not being able to hold and nurse my baby.”<br />“Mom-shaming isn’t always overt,” said Ms. Parker, who works in financial services in New York. “It’s often that side comment that feels like your truth but comes out as judgment.” She deleted her Instagram account.<br />Among the things women learn about when they have their first baby are all the social-media groups for new moms. The online communities, which once supplemented in-person meetups, have become the primary source of information and connection for many during the pandemic.<br />But some of the groups women have turned to for support and camaraderie have left them feeling even more isolated. Age-old debates over best parenting practices are becoming more heated, according to some moms. Fortunately, there are alternative apps and services designed to reduce toxicity.

      <td>ROME—Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Cardinal Robert Sarah as head of the Vatican’s office for liturgy, removing an outspoken conservative and possible future pope from the ranks of Vatican leadership.<br />The Holy See Press Office announced Saturday that Cardinal Sarah had stepped down. No successor has been named.<br />The cardinal submitted his resignation as required by church law when he turned 75 on June 15 of last year. But the pope frequently lets cardinals serve two or three years past that age, though not past 80.<br />In accepting Cardinal Sarah’s resignation, the pope has removed a subordinate out of step with his approach to liturgy, homosexuality and relations with the Muslim world. The cardinal is a hero to many conservative Catholics, some of whom see him as a future pontiff. He will still be able to vote in a conclave to elect a pope until he turns 80.<br />Last year, the cardinal raised controversy with a book widely interpreted as an attempt to influence Pope Francis’ decision on whether to allow the ordination of married men as priests. The episode led to  embarrassment for the cardinal when retired Pope Benedict XVI asked to have his name removed as the book’s co-author.</td>

      <td>The Los Angeles jewelry designer is thriving after a year of pandemic belt-tightening and a boost from the vice president, a fan of her pearls and other pieces</td>
      <td>Off Brand is a thrice-monthly column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />WHEN THE REALITY of the pandemic hit California last March, jewelry designer Irene Neuwirth found herself in tears, walking along Venice Beach with her boyfriend. Like so many business owners, she was grappling with difficult decisions. Her eponymous company had just endured the loss of its most important vendor, Barneys New York, to bankruptcy. The impending shutdown, which would close her two Los Angeles stores, spelled further disaster for the fashion industry, particularly independent designers. She remembers thinking, “Our business is going to go down, we’re going to have to let people go…I can’t do it.” That day, she resolved to stop paying herself and recommit to the business in a more personal way.<br />That meant reaching out to individual customers, hand-writing letters of thanks for every piece sold, and focusing on e-commerce. She continued to hand-draw each design for the quirky, colorful, stone-heavy pieces that have enjoyed the status of luxurious cult items for 18 years. Not only did Ms. Neuwirth’s 24-person business stay strong, it wound up having one of its best years on record. Direct-to-consumer website orders, which previously had accounted for only 20% of her business, rose to up to 60%. With a combination of hustle, belt-tightening and hard work, Irene Neuwirth became a pandemic success story.<br />Some serious luck also played a role, in the form of attention from Vice President Kamala Harris. While Ms. Neuwirth’s brand has no shortage of high-profile Hollywood fans—Busy Philipps and Maya Rudolph, to name a few—Ms. Harris catapulted Ms. Neuwirth to history-book levels of prominence. She showcased Irene Neuwirth designs at several major events: a “gumball” pearl-and-chain necklace at the 2020 Democratic National Convention; a pearl-and-turquoise necklace at a vice-presidential debate; sparkling custom diamond-and-pearl earrings for the evening of the inauguration.<br />Ms. Harris wears pieces by other jewelry designers, too. As a former Alpha Kappa Alpha member from her Howard University days, she’s especially partial to pearls in all forms, which are an important part of the sorority’s symbolism. But the Irene Neuwirth designs are the ones she wears most prominently, over and over.</td>

A steady stream of institutional demand has been credited with driving much of that rally. Billionaire hedge-fund managers disclosed purchases: Paul Tudor Jones called it a “great speculation.” A handful of companies, most notably  Tesla Inc.,  recently started buying it for their corporate reserves.<br />Yet determining a fair value for bitcoin is much harder than valuing stocks, investors say, both because bitcoin isn’t a traditional asset and because much about it is misunderstood.<br />“It’s a difficult asset class to value,” said  J.P. Morgan  analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, who estimates the value of one bitcoin could be as little as $11,000 or as much as $146,000.</td>

      <td>Tech billionaire joined with researchers to track infections; effort explored coronavirus immunity</td>
      <td>When Covid-19 shut down the U.S. economy in March, Elon Musk had a rocket to launch.<br />The billionaire’s space exploration venture, SpaceX, was planning to blast a crewed spacecraft into the sky in May and wanted to stay on schedule. That meant finding a way to keep facilities safely open and limit the spread of Covid-19, a challenge when tests were in short supply.<br />To monitor the prevalence of the virus among SpaceX workers nationwide, Mr. Musk and the rocket company’s top medical executive worked with doctors and academic researchers to build an antibody-testing program. More than 4,000 SpaceX workers volunteered for monthly blood tests.<br />This week the group published its findings, which suggest that a certain threshold of antibodies might provide people lasting protection against the virus. Mr. Musk is listed as a co-author of the peer-reviewed study, which appears in the journal Nature Communications.<br />“People can have antibodies, but it doesn’t mean they are going to be immune” to Covid-19, said Galit Alter, a co-author of the study who is a member of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard. Individuals who experienced fewer, milder Covid-19 symptoms generated fewer antibodies and were therefore less likely to meet the threshold for longer-term immunity, the study found.</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—A Russian court denied an appeal by Alexei Navalny, sealing an earlier ruling that would see the prominent Kremlin critic and anticorruption activist spend a lengthy sentence in a penal colony.<br />Mr. Navalny, whose detention in January sparked mass protests that mushroomed into a broader act of defiance against Russian President Vladimir Putin, was sentenced earlier this month for violating the conditions of a suspended sentence from 2014. Mr. Navalny was detained upon returning from Germany, where he spent months recovering from a poison attack that he blames on Mr. Putin. The Kremlin denies any involvement.<br />The rallies, which at one point saw over 40,000 people on the streets of Moscow and thousands more across the country, were met with a sweeping crackdown by the authorities, who detained more than 10,000. While Mr. Navalny’s allies have temporarily suspended large-scale protests until the spring, the protest wave has cemented his position as Mr. Putin’s most vocal critic and a potent threat to the Kremlin leader’s two-decade-old rule.<br />At the hearing on Saturday, Mr. Navalny appeared inside a glass cage for defendants and flashed a “V” sign for victory. He rejected the notion that he was hiding from justice, saying that his whereabouts were publicly known, and he described the legal process as absurd.<br />“If I was hiding, I wouldn’t be standing here in this aquarium,” Mr. Navalny told the court.</td>

      <td>Scientists say high rates of viral spread in a partially immunized population could encourage mutations that make virus harder to contain</td>
      <td>Scientists say the world has reached a precarious point in the Covid-19 pandemic, one where conditions are ripe for the rise of more new coronavirus variants that could complicate efforts to control the disease.<br />The virus continues to spread rapidly in many parts of the world, even as segments of the population have gained some degree of immunity as a result of having been infected or vaccinated.<br />Scientists say that combination—high rates of viral transmission and a partially immunized population—encourages the emergence of variants that are potentially more transmissible or more lethal. More transmission means more opportunities for the virus to evolve, they say.<br />“If everyone has immunity, then you have pretty much no virus circulating and the virus can’t adapt,” University of Bern molecular epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft said, adding that if no one within a population has immunity, then there’s no pressure on the virus to evolve. “That middle part, where you have a partially vaccinated population, or a partially immune population with lots of virus circulating, that’s kind of your danger point,” she said.<br />New variants could also reduce the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments and lead to reinfections among people who have already recovered from Covid-19, scientists say. The key to minimizing these problems, they say, lies with social distancing and other measures to reduce contagion as well as with ramping up vaccination efforts, which have lagged behind in many places.</td>

      <td>The months since tennis returned to action last fall have been one long experiment for players—in preparation, in logistics, and in not going crazy. They have been locked in hotel rooms, torn up training plans, and bounced from bubble to bubble. This winter, they traveled halfway around the world for an Australian Open that wasn’t guaranteed to happen.<br />But somewhere in all the uncertainty, Japan’s Naomi Osaka became the surest thing in tennis. Practically undefeated in any competitive match since the coronavirus hiatus last summer, Osaka on Saturday won the Australian Open by beating American Jennifer Brady 6-4, 6-3 in Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena.<br />Osaka, 23, now has four Grand Slam titles to her name, adding to the 2018 and 2020 U.S. Opens, plus her win in Australia in 2019. She has never lost a major final.<br />On a women’s circuit that has grown extremely deep—eight of the previous 17 majors had been won by first-time champions—Osaka has turned into a model of consistency. The last woman not named Serena Williams to rack up her fourth major was Maria Sharapova at Roland-Garros in 2012. And she did it without a pandemic dropping into her career.<br />“I think the thing that I’m most proud of is now mentally strong I’ve become. I used to be really up and down,” Osaka said before the final. “The quarantine process and seeing everything that’s going on in the world, for me it put a lot into perspective…I used to weigh my entire existence on if I won or lost a tennis match. That’s just not how I feel any more.”</td>

Panel of Experts that monitors the ban on transfers of weapons to Libya says companies controlled by Mr. Prince provided three aircraft to assist in sending helicopters and military contractors to help Russian-backed Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar in 2019.<br />The plan to send Western mercenaries to Libya developed as foreign weapons and fighters poured into the country in 2019 and 2020 from a variety of outside powers, including Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, deepening a conflict that has been ongoing since 2014, the report says, according to the diplomat.<br />Mr. Prince is likely to be referred to the U.N.’s Sanctions Committee, which could order a freeze on his assets or a travel ban, according to the New York-based diplomat and a former official with knowledge of the situation. The permanent members of the Security Council, including the U.S., Russia, or China, could veto any potential sanctions against Mr. Prince, who has had dealings with all three countries.<br />“Erik Prince had absolutely nothing to do with any operation in Libya in 2019, or at any other time,” a spokesman for Mr. Prince said in an email.</td>

      <td>His proposal this week is dead on arrival, but smaller bills might pass.</td>
      <td>Partisans on both sides during the Trump Presidency used immigration to bludgeon each other, but President Biden has a fresh opening for bipartisan cooperation. Now we’ll find out if Democrats want to reform immigration or keep using it as a political cudgel.<br />Mr. Biden made an opening offer Thursday with a bill by New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez and California Rep. Linda Sanchez. The bill is dead on arrival in Congress since it doesn’t improve border security and provides more or less blanket legalization to the country’s 11 million or so undocumented immigrants. “We must not start with concessions out of the gate. We are not going to start with two million undocumented people instead of 11 million,” Mr. Menendez said. “We will never win an argument that we don’t have the courage to make.”<br />GOP restrictionists during the Trump Presidency also introduced immigration bills that were essentially political statements. They went nowhere. The lesson for Democrats is they won’t win an argument in Congress or the public without making concessions to the other party and immigration realities.<br />Start with the bill’s eight-year path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and three years for some farm workers and young adults who were brought to the country illegally as children. No matter what restrictionists say, most of these folks will never be deported. Many have been here for decades and contribute significantly to the economy.<br />The young adults known as Dreamers are particularly sympathetic since they didn’t knowingly break immigration laws and live in legal limbo. Barack Obama granted them temporary legal status and work permits. As we’ve argued, he didn’t have the legal authority to do so since the Constitution grants Congress power to regulate immigration. But Congress also has a moral imperative to grant a reprieve after the government invited them to come out of the shadows.</td>

      <td>His CFPB pick wants a new agency to control politics and speech.</td>
      <td>In our age of a powerful administrative state and weak Congress, some of the most consequential government officials are the little-known heads of alphabet-soup federal agencies. One of them is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which was designed as its own regulatory fiefdom insulated from accountability. So it’s worrying that President Biden’s nominee to head the agency wants the administrative state to extend its reach into political speech.<br />Mr. Biden sent the nomination of Rohit Chopra, an Elizabeth Warren protégé and commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, to the Senate last week. Senators who want to understand Mr. Chopra’s thinking about the role of regulators in American democracy might crack open a report he co-authored in 2018 for the Roosevelt Institute. It envisions an unaccountable Washington “corruption” czar writing rules, issuing fines and working his will over politicians, think tanks and nonprofits.<br />If that sounds constitutionally suspect, well, it comes with the progressive territory. The Supreme Court ruled last year that the CFPB’s design was unconstitutional because its director, who is appointed by the President for a five-year term, could only be removed for cause.<br />The Court said giving a regulator that much power “clashes with constitutional structure.” But that’s nothing compared to Mr. Chopra’s proposed “Public Integrity Protection Agency” (PIPA), where the director would serve as many as 10 years, “subject to removal proceedings similar to that of a federal judge”—that is, effectively untouchable by the elected branches.<br />Unlike the CFPB, which regulates commerce and loans, Mr. Chopra’s even-less-accountable PIPA would regulate core political activities. The report proposes new restrictions on advocacy, declaring that the “use of think tanks and other nonprofit organizations to further the economic interests of its benefactors through policy research should be impermissible.”</td>

      <td>A 90-year-old walks miles for the shot, as a 34-year-old sneaks in.</td>
      <td>Finding an open appointment to get the Covid-19 vaccine was a headache, so 90-year-old Fran Goldman wasn’t going to be deterred by some snow. The walk was three miles, each direction. She dressed in layers and grabbed walking sticks. “It was not easy going,” Ms. Goldman told the Seattle Times. “It was challenging.”<br />Did we mention she had a hip replaced last year? But a trek in the snow will be worth it for two great-grandchildren. “I can’t wait to be able to hold them,” Ms. Goldman told the newspaper. Now there’s an antidote to the articles about public skepticism of the vaccines. Polls last year showing hesitancy were noteworthy, but two months into America’s vaccination program, the story is about demand.<br />Here’s another one, though not quite as uplifting. In Florida, which is prioritizing people 65 and older, two women aged 34 and 44 went to an Orange County immunization site “dressed up as grannies,” an official said Thursday. That made national headlines, although it’s not clear whether it was exaggerated.<br />Body-camera video released Friday shows little disguise, but both of the women had face masks and glasses, and one was wearing a gray hat. That said, the women “had altered their years of birth on their vaccination registrations to bypass the state system,” the Orlando Sentinel reported. They apparently had already received a first vaccine dose but were denied the second and issued trespass warnings.<br />A heroic story and a malicious one. Yet both are good signs of vaccine demand, since ending this pandemic depends on getting millions more shots into millions more arms.</td>

      <td>The new U.S. Administration hopes giving up leverage will get Tehran to talk.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s stronger relationship with allies and partners could give him an advantage over Donald Trump in foreign affairs. But his Iran strategy will test whether appeasement with friends produces better outcomes than standing strong alone.<br />Mr. Trump upset Iran, and America’s European allies, by leaving the 2015 nuclear deal and embarking on a “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign. Mr. Biden has said Washington would return to the accord and lift sanctions if Tehran returned to compliance, while the Islamic Republic demanded the inverse. Someone has to blink.<br />The White House hasn’t given in entirely, but this week wasn’t encouraging. On Thursday Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. is committed to resurrecting the nuclear deal after a meeting with his French, German and British counterparts. Later, the U.S. accepted a European offer to mediate with the Iranians, who have yet to respond.<br />Tehran ran circles around Barack Obama’s negotiators, many of whom have returned to the Biden Administration, so it wouldn’t be surprising if Iran now agrees to talks. Some informal negotiations are inevitable, but this was an especially bad week for the U.S. to take the plunge.<br />After rockets hit a U.S. base in Iraq this week, killing a contractor and wounding nine others, including a U.S. service member, the State Department vowed that the U.S. would “hold accountable those responsible.” An Iran-backed militia, with Tehran’s implicit or explicit consent, is almost certainly to blame. Yet the U.S. has responded with a major concession on Iran sanctions that will help empower such groups. Tehran will reasonably think Mr. Biden is so eager for talks that he’ll ignore attacks on Americans.</td>

We are committed to the @LATimes.”<br />When Mr. Soon-Shiong acquired the Times, the San Diego Union-Tribune and a handful of weeklies from  Tribune Publishing Co. , then called Tronc Inc., in 2018, it was met with great fanfare from staff and media watchers after years of turmoil and downsizing at the publications. At the time, he said that the sale represented the beginning of a new era and that he intended to do what it took to make the business viable for the next 100 years.<br />He has since grown dissatisfied with the news organization’s slow expansion of its digital audience and its substantial losses, the people said. He also has increasingly come to believe that the Los Angeles Times and San Diego Union-Tribune—together known as the California Times company—would be better served if they were part of a larger media group, they said.</td>

      <td>To follow the pianist into his thoughts can deliver a view from ‘inside of the music.’</td>
      <td>Essay collections don’t get much honor in the book industry, but I have a weakness for them. A compendium of unrelated or loosely related essays by an author you admire allows you to read it when you feel inclined without the discipline of following a book-length argument. Miscellanies by musicians and music critics are a particular favorite of mine, but good ones are rare. The tenor Ian Bostridge published a fine collection, “A Singer’s Notebook,” in 2011, and the critic and composer Robin Holloway’s “On Music: Essays and Diversions,” from 2003, contains some terrific criticism. Before that there is Samuel Lipman’s 1992 “Music and More” and Andrew Porter’s several collections from the 1970s and ’80s.<br />I was therefore eager to read Stephen Hough’s “Rough Ideas: Reflections on Music and More.” Mr. Hough (pronounced huff), a British pianist and an accomplished interpreter of a wide array of classical works, is one of a very few gifted musicians who are capable of writing with clarity and wit.<br />“Rough Ideas” is a gathering of Mr. Hough’s writings on music and performance, and a few on religion. “Many of the reflections in this book,” he explains, “germinated from articles first published in newspapers . . . and magazines” and from blog posts at the Daily Telegraph’s website. Presumably as a consequence of this germination, the pieces include no reference to the place and date of their original publication—a slight annoyance. Indeed, many of the essays, he writes elsewhere, were “unfinished musings on scraps of paper or saved as files on the go on my iPhone” until he used them for this collection.<br />Mr. Hough reminds me a little of Saul Bellow’s character Moses Herzog, who can’t stop scribbling his thoughts about everything, day and night. Do we really need a squib about Mr. Hough’s elderly Russian landlady who made a wonderful meal of beef stroganoff but who wouldn’t give him the recipe because, as she claimed improbably, “General Stroganoff wrote it out for me himself”? Then again, maybe these ramshackle observations work; “Herzog” is a great book.<br />Part of what makes Mr. Hough’s writing on music so appealing is that he writes as a performer, as if somehow from the inside of the music. His recordings of Johannes Brahms’s piano concertos—he plays the Romantic repertoire cleanly and crisply, without any of the histrionic banging one gets from some other famous performers—and here he writes of these two great concertos with insight. “The Second is the better piece,” he writes, “but the First is the greater piece. . . . The Second is better constructed, better orchestrated; themes are better developed; harmonies are better judged; textures are better balanced—but for me the First has a greater burst of pure, utter, natural genius. Its flame flares with such intensity, and with such promise of more to come ([Brahms] was only twenty-five when he wrote it), that I find myself overwhelmed by it in a way I’m not by the Second, written twenty-two years later.” To me, a non-performer, this sounds exactly right.</td>

      <td>‘When we lower our standards to pretend we know what we don’t know, we diminish the work and misinform society,’ says Prof. John Staddon.</td>
      <td>Durham, N.C.<br />When Prof. John Staddon read the “Statement to the Community Regarding Anti-Racism” sent out by Duke University’s president this summer, he was alarmed. The president, Vincent Price, promised to require “anti-racism and anti-bias training for every member of our faculty, student body, and staff.” To Mr. Staddon, that sounded more like indoctrination than academic inquiry. He responded in an open letter.<br />Mr. Price declared: “I cannot as a white person begin to fully understand the daily fear and pain and oppression that is endemic to the Black experience.” Mr. Staddon’s rejoinder: “Your reassurance is fine as an expression of empathy. I daresay you feel better, and possibly your African American audience does as well. But feelings differ: Unless the discussion can be moved from feelings to facts, no harmony is possible. Empathy, guilt, and good intentions are a dodgy basis for sweeping resolutions.”<br />Mr. Price affirmed that the “hard work before us” requires the community to “take transformative action now toward eliminating the systems of racism and inequality. . . . That starts with a personal transformation and . . . must end in institutional transformation.” Mr. Staddon countered that “this phraseology will strike many as more like psychotherapy or a call to religious conversion than a policy prescription. What are these ‘systems of racism and inequality?’ How have they affected Duke and how is Duke involved in them? Or are they societal concerns and thus the responsibility not of a university but of government, the church, and civil society?”<br />This isn’t the first time Mr. Staddon, 83, a tall, English-born American, has challenged the dogma of his peers. A professor of psychology, neuroscience and biology, he is something of a modern Cassandra, warning for more than three decades of the corruption of academia by political activists. As America becomes woke, his scholarly critiques read like prophecy.</td>

      <td>Among other errors, 70% of the doses the government bought aren’t yet approved by its health officials.</td>
      <td>Toronto<br />If you’re impatient with the pace of Covid-19 vaccine distribution in the U.S., count your blessings. At least you don’t live in Canada. As of Wednesday, my country had administered only 3.52 vaccine doses per 100 people, according to the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data website. The U.S., at 17.00, was doing almost five times as well. The figures were 80.07 in Israel, 25.04 in the U.K. and 5.40 in the European Union.<br />Why is Canada such a laggard among developed nations? The government of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau didn’t negotiate contracts with established drug companies. Rather, it quietly approved a working relationship between Canadian researchers and a Chinese vaccine maker,  CanSino Biologics Inc.  CanSino abandoned its project in August after multiple failures. Ottawa then had to rush through agreements with  Pfizer ,  Moderna and other companies. “I would not have put all our eggs in the basket of China,” Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole told reporters.<br />When Canada and other countries experienced a significant spike in Covid-19 cases last month (which has now subsided), Pfizer reduced its shipment to my country by more than two-thirds for several weeks. Moderna announced that only three-quarters of its vaccines would arrive in Canada during early February.<br />Other options are off the table for now. Although Canada purchased 398 million doses in all, more than 70% are vaccines that haven’t received approval from health officials. The Liberals have pointed fingers at drug companies and provincial governments.</td>

      <td>The grid is designed to shut down, and we’re designing it to shut down more often.</td>
      <td>In 2011 an earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, killing 18,500 people, wiping away neighborhoods, depositing fuels, sludge and toxic chemicals across a considerable landscape. And yet all anybody wanted to talk about was a nuclear power accident that killed nobody. This selective focus may well have contributed to an ill-advised evacuation that led to premature deaths. Angela Merkel thereupon kicked off a world-wide retreat from nuclear power that likely put paid to any hope of meeting the greenhouse targets named in the Paris accord.<br />We may be suffering a similar neurosis now. A cold snap that touches all of Texas with subfreezing temperatures is a once-a-century event, if that, and yet our discussion about it is rapidly becoming a self-defeating mess.<br />Twenty years old is a debate about whether America’s grid resilience is in some kind of crisis. For most Texans, this week’s outages were measured in hours and intermittent. They weren’t the five- and 10-day outages experienced by my neighbors in Rob-and-Laura land three or four times in the past 12 years. Texas water shortages due to burst pipes also have a Northeastern parallel. Suburban New Yorkers who rely on electric well pumps were reduced to flushing their toilets with lake or stream water.<br />Federal data are not much help. From 2013 to 2018, routine interruptions were steady; those attributed to “major events” grew sharply in the final two years. But one thing we’ve long known. By design, U.S. systems generate a lot more downtime (as much as 90% more) than systems in many European countries, where population density makes it cost-effective to bury power lines, where hurricanes and tornadoes are unknown, where forests were tamed or removed centuries ago, and where their idea of wilderness is our idea of a suburb.<br />In covering this week’s Texas outages, the Economist magazine couldn’t decide whether the world’s “climate crisis” or “America’s infrastructure crisis” was the right headline. The reality is more prosaic. Significant freezing episodes led to blackouts at least seven times from 1983 to 2011. In Texas, politicians, utility executives and citizens have repeatedly been asked by nature: Do you want to winterize your grid against rare winter outages or do you prefer lower rates? Lower rates kept winning, at least till now.</td>

Mr. Manchin, a centrist who represents a state that voted twice for former President Donald Trump, is seen as a swing vote in the Senate.<br />“I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget,” Mr. Manchin said in a Friday statement. “For this reason, I cannot support her nomination.”<br />The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Manchin’s statement.<br />The Senate has so far confirmed seven of Mr. Biden’s top nominees, all with bipartisan support. If the White House were to pull Ms. Tanden’s nomination or it failed to reach the 51 votes needed for confirmation, it would mark the first time one of Mr. Biden’s nominees has been blocked.</td>

Whether he will remain a significant player politically or not, only time will tell. To say that he “won’t win another national election” is an assertion which I question and find too unsubstantiated to consider valid.<br />It is disturbing that President Biden has signed more than 30 executive orders already, many of them of a very radical nature as is his constant mentioning of systemic racism and white supremacy. In his Inauguration Day speech he claimed he would unify the country, but he’s doing the opposite. His destruction of many thousands of jobs by closing the Keystone XL Pipeline, not following the science and delaying the opening of public schools very clearly show that he is a puppet of the far left of the Democratic Party.<br />There are many millions of Trump followers who are law-abiding citizens, and many not-so-radical Democrats who are now beginning to understand what is going on and know that this radical agenda, woke culture and hypocrisy will get us nowhere good. That, plus the coming tax increases, the underperforming economy, which will come accompanied by a tremendous increase in regulations, will most likely, in a short time, despite the very biased media, make President Trump look good.<br />Abel A.

Or $60,584,” Page One, Feb. 12). This drives up the premiums paid by working Americans and has created the in-network, out-of-network nightmare. Until the government pays at least the full cost of care for patients, the rates charged to private insurance companies will never make sense.<br />Bessie Montesano, M.D.<br />Myrtle Beach, S.C.<br /><br />The “insanity” of U.S. health-care pricing is often the result of governmental intervention in markets. Allow an open and free marketplace in health care and pricing will rationalize. Historically, governmental involvement results in higher cost and less efficiency, for example, housing costs, K-12 education and, especially, college education and, of course, health care.</td>

      <td>Regarding Peggy Noonan’s “A Vote to Acquit Is a Vote for a Lie” (Declarations, Feb. 13): Hard to argue Peggy Noonan’s points, but what if the circumstances had been reversed and President Trump had won and those voters disappointed with the results stormed the Capitol? Think of the summer’s BLM rioters. How would the narrative have changed? Would they be called insurrectionists or American heroes democratically voicing their rights against an illegitimate president? The woman who was shot and killed, whom no one grieves for in the media, would be the new George Floyd. The officer who shot her would be under investigation and on administrative leave. The president would have been impeached for failing to protect the Capitol; the story would haunt us for four more years in the media. There is no excuse for what happened on Jan. 6, but a reason it happened is the double standard allowed for the left and the media.<br />Ed Jenkins<br />Camarillo, Calif.<br /><br />No country-club, genteel Republican will win national office again, only fighters like Donald Trump. Donald Trump left office with knives and arrows stuck in his back from Democrats, the media and Republicans alike. Yes, I want Republicans and conservatives who will stand up against the abuse sent our way. Donald Trump did that, whether Peggy Noonan approved or not.</td>

      <td>TIJUANA, Mexico—Hundreds of migrants crowded the pedestrian border crossing with the U.S. here Friday morning as the Biden administration let in the first handful who had been forced to wait in Mexico for their asylum claims to be resolved under Trump administration policy.<br />Biden administration officials had stressed in English and Spanish communications that only people contacted ahead of time would be allowed in Friday while others needed to register online and wait. A San Diego aid group set to receive the migrants said they were told by the government only 25 would be let in Friday.<br />The admissions are part of President Biden’s reversal of the Trump policy officially called Migrant Protection Protocols but generally known as Remain in Mexico. It required migrants seeking asylum, many of them families, to wait in Mexican border cities for their claims to be resolved, rather than in the U.S. as had previously been the case.<br />The waits have been prolonged by the Covid-19 pandemic that closed immigration courts handling their claims.<br />The administration announced last week that, beginning Friday, it would start allowing some migrants in the program to enter the U.S. The government said it is moving slowly because allowing in large numbers of people could pose a public-health risk.</td>

      <td>A new study on the impact of the Cuomo nursing-home order.</td>
      <td>Why did New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s Health Department work so  hard for so long to prevent accurate disclosure of Covid deaths among the state’s nursing home residents? The governor has presented the scandal as simply a debate about the way deaths were categorized, while rejecting the notion that his policies increased mortality. His position will be harder to maintain after Thursday’s release of a new study from New York’s Empire Center for Public Policy.<br />Readers will recall that the Empire Center is the think tank that spent months trying to pry Covid data out of Mr. Cuomo’s government, which offered a series of unbelievable excuses for its refusal to disclose. Finally on Feb. 10—six months after the Empire Center filed a request under the state’s Freedom of Information Law, five months after it sued the government, and one week after a state court ruled that the Cuomo administration had violated the law and ordered it to come clean—Team Cuomo finally started coughing up some of the records.<br />The Empire Center’s new analysis of long-hidden data suggests that  a key Cuomo policy had disastrous results in the spring of 2020. After reviewing the information on deaths in long-term care facilities, Bill Hammond and Ian Kingsbury of the Empire Center report:<br />The study clearly suggests that Cuomo policy cost lives, and not just a few of them. According to the authors:<br />The Empire Center’s findings directly contradict what the Cuomo Health Department was saying last July—even as officials refused to disclose the underlying data that would have allowed the public to evaluate Cuomo claims.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. officially rejoined the Paris climate change agreement on Friday as President Biden puts environmental policy at the center of his agenda and prepares to work with world leaders to cut global greenhouse gas emissions.<br />On his first day in office last month Mr. Biden took an initial step toward rejoining the global accord, which was a signature achievement of former President Barack Obama and from which former President Donald Trumpsubsequently withdrew.<br />Under the agreement’s rules, a country can formally re-enter the pact 30 days after it gives notice to the United Nations. Friday marks the end of that 30-day period.<br />“The work to reduce our emissions has already begun, and we will waste no time in engaging our partners around the world to build our global resilience,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote on Twitter.<br />Mr. Trump argued that the agreement’s terms weren’t fair to the U.S. because other major emitters weren’t doing enough to cut emissions under the pact. Though Mr. Trump repeatedly said during his presidency that the U.S. was no longer a party to the agreement, the withdrawal became effective in early November 2020, near the end of his term, because it took time to formally exit the pact.</td>

      <td>A prominent corporate lawyer who served one month in prison after admitting that he paid $75,000 to rig his daughter’s college-admissions test score won’t lose his law license permanently, a New York disciplinary body ruled this week.<br />Gordon Caplan, who served as co-chair of New York law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, was among the first parents to plead guilty in 2019 in the sprawling “Varsity Blues” college-admissions scandal. In all, 57 people—including parents, college coaches, test proctors and others—have been charged, and more than 40 have pleaded guilty, including the ringleader, William “Rick” Singer, who is awaiting sentencing.<br />Mr. Caplan pleaded to felony conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest-services mail fraud for paying Mr. Singer to have a proctor change answers on his daughter’s ACT score. In addition to the month in prison, a U.S. District Court judge in Boston sentenced him to 250 hours of community service and a $50,000 fine.<br />Felony convictions often result in the loss of a law license, but a New York appellate court on Thursday agreed with an earlier disciplinary decision that a two-year suspension was enough. Retroactive to around the time of his sentencing, Mr. Caplan can practice law again in November.<br />An attorney for Mr. Caplan, 54 years old, said he “is deeply appreciative of the treatment he has received by the court and is committed to making amends for his conduct.”</td>
