      <td>Golf legend Tiger Woods was injured in a roll-over traffic accident near Los Angeles early Tuesday and hospitalized after he was extricated from the wreck with the “jaws of life” by firefighters and paramedics, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said.<br />Woods suffered multiple leg injuries and was taken into surgery, his agent Mark Steinberg said in a statement. A lieutenant with the sheriff’s department said the injuries were not life threatening.<br />Woods was removed from the vehicle with emergency rescue tools and taken by an ambulance to a local hospital after the crash at 7:12 a.m local time, the authorities said in a tweet on Tuesday afternoon. The severity of his injuries is not clear at this time. No cause for the crash, in the Rancho Palos Verdes area, was given, and the vehicle in the single-car wreck suffered “major damage,” according to authorities.<br />While the full extent of Woods’s injuries aren’t known, the accident is the latest chapter in a long series of vehicular mishaps that in the past have knocked him off course in his quest to be golf’s greatest player ever.  His first car accident in 2009 kicked off a sex scandal, and eight years later he was found asleep at the wheel with painkillers in his system. These defined the epic downfall of an athlete who experienced a meteoric rise unlike few others, only for him to be back atop the golf world once again when he won the 2019 Masters.<br />Woods, 45 years old, said in January that he had recently undergone back surgery, the latest in a string of ailments that threw arguably the greatest golfer ever off course. He appeared on TV for an interview over the weekend at the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club in the Los Angeles area, which he hosts, though he didn’t say when he would be healthy enough to return. The car that crashed appeared to be a Genesis vehicle.</td>

The administration has been holding meetings with auto companies and suppliers.<br />The White House didn’t comment Tuesday.<br />A White House official previously said the administration had asked embassies to identify ways foreign countries and companies could help address the chip shortage. Among those involved are Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, and Brian Deese, Mr. Biden’s top economic adviser.<br />The official said a broad review is under way to look at critical supply chains “to identify vulnerabilities and take steps, such as spurring increased U.S. domestic production, to address gaps over the long term and support good paying jobs.”</td>

      <td>LONDON—By the middle of this year, all adults in Britain are due to be offered a Covid-19 vaccine in what is on course to be the fastest inoculation rollout in a major Western country. But disease modelers advising the U.K. government recently made a sobering projection: 56,000 more Covid-19 deaths by the summer of next year, even if the country tiptoes out of lockdown and the vaccines work.<br />The study points to the uncomfortable prospect that even with an effective vaccine, the virus will continue to take a toll on society and that some restrictions may have to be periodically reintroduced to control the coronavirus’s spread.<br />The conclusion: Businesses and governments around the world need to prepare to live with Covid-19, accepting that the virus won’t disappear but equally that lockdowns cannot go on forever once hospitalizations are brought down to manageable levels.<br />“We cannot escape the fact that lifting lockdown will result in more cases, more hospitalizations and sadly more deaths,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Parliament on Monday as he mapped out a slow and conditional route out of lockdown. “There is therefore no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain or indeed a zero-Covid world.”<br />The caution doesn’t undermine the value of a successful vaccine rollout. New data released Monday showed that Britain’s vaccination program—which has given at least one shot to more than a third of the country’s 53 million adults—has significantly lowered infections and cut serious illness by even more.</td>

      <td>Blow from Covid-19 pandemic to state’s fiscal health is smaller than feared</td>
      <td>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is proposing a $44.8 billion budget that boosts spending on education, economic-development programs and pension payments, as state revenue collections continue to outperform the dire predictions made at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The governor’s spending plan calls for about $200 million to help jump-start the economy with grants and loans for small businesses and other initiatives and an increase in education spending of more than $600 million. Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, also has proposed making a $6.4 billion pension payment for the fiscal year beginning in July, which would be the first full payment to the state’s underfunded retirement system since 1996.<br />In a recorded budget address released Tuesday, Mr. Murphy said the state needs to begin planning for its future beyond the pandemic.<br />“It is the time for us to also lean into the economic policies that will not just get us through the remaining months of the pandemic, but which will supercharge our re-emergence from it and the recovery that awaits on the other side,” said Mr. Murphy, who is up for reelection this year.<br />The Murphy administration will now begin budget talks with leaders in the Democratic-controlled state Legislature. State Sen. Paul Sarlo, the Democratic chairman of the Senate budget and appropriations committee, said Mr. Murphy’s budget plan was a “reasonable proposal that makes use of anticipated resources to address the expected needs of the people of New Jersey.”</td>

      <td>Soleil Moon Frye reprises her role in a reboot of the boundary-breaking sitcom.</td>
      <td>‘Punky Brewster,” the “Punky-Powered” sitcom of the mid-’80s starring the bubbly Soleil Moon Frye, had a relatively brief life on NBC, another in syndication and was the inspiration for a Saturday morning cartoon. The very phrase “Saturday morning cartoon” summons up the kind of nostalgia that Peacock’s rebooted “Punky Brewster” is intended to kindle. Rather than the fragrant recycling effort it actually suggests.<br />This is not the fault of the cast. Ms. Moon Frye—who was 8 years old when she made her debut as Punky—has maintained enough of a presence on various TV series that fans won’t be too shocked that she’s now playing a 40-ish divorced mom of three, living in the spacious Chicago apartment left to her by her adoptive father, Henry (who was played in the original show by George Gaynes; the late actor’s photo occupies a place of honor in the new, Punkified living room). She is a charming presence, and so are the young actors playing her kids—the teenage Hannah (Lauren Lindsey Donzis), the younger Diego (Noah Cottrell) and the even younger and evidently gender-curious Daniel (Oliver De Los Santos). Daniel and Diego are adopted; Hannah seems to be the biological child of Punky and her ex, Travis (Freddie Prinze Jr.), who, like Seinfeld’s neighbor Kramer, is given to barging in unannounced and often at inopportune times. Given that Punky’s resuscitated sex life is to be a recurring part of the storyline, this open-door policy could well lead to situations of the lowly comic and cringe-inducing variety. Likewise, the fact that Hannah and Punky are both dating, and even run into each other one night with their beaus in tow.<br />The overall tone of “Punky Brewster” redux feels like it’s been hidden under someone’s mullet since 1984. What distinguished the show from the competition then and now is the adoption angle, which is a significant one: The original “Punky Brewster” was a landmark of sorts, in that Punky had been abandoned by her mother at a shopping mall and became the first regularly scheduled prime-time network foster child (Henry adopted her in season 2). The new show’s prepubescent wild card, its element of conflict, its chief purveyor of precocious wisecrackery, is Izzy (Quinn Copeland), who has also been abandoned by her mother, and thus worms her way into Punky’s heart and home. Izzy has been the biggest escape artist at Fenster Hall—the same facility from which Henry had to extract Punky after she entered the system back in 1984—and has been under the jurisdiction of social worker Cherie (Cherie Johnson, of the original series), who apparently greases the bureaucratic wheels so Punky can immediately foster Izzy.<br />Unlike the old show, this “Punky Brewster” doesn’t make much out of the hard facts of foster care—it doesn’t make much of a deal at all about the fact that Punky’s mother calls her on the phone at the end of episode 1, after 36 silent years. (Mom goes all but unmentioned for several subsequent episodes.) Punky tells her indignant threesome that they don’t just need to make space for Izzy in their apartment, “you need to make space for her in your hearts.” Everyone groans, including the kids. But in both versions of the show, the catalyst is the relatively rare occurrence of outright child abandonment that situates their characters. The intentions are good—mainstreaming adoption and foster care in pop culture. But the real-life foster-care system is much more concerned with children separated from their parents over alleged negligence or abuse, which is often the result of poverty. It would be interesting to see a show tackle foster care from that angle. This is not that show.<br />It is, instead, a gently comic program in which every episode has a moral and which mines its own past in various ways—Punky’s unbridled color sense and her mismatched sneakers, for instance. But if viewers are looking for a blithe skip down Memory Lane, “Punky Brewster” trips on the untied laces of its pink and orange Converse. The incessant laugh track, for one thing, is a throwback to the general mediocrity of so many network comedies of the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, and is a means of strong-arming giggles out of its more vulnerable and sentimental viewers. It’s difficult to tell whether the dialogue by executive producers Steve and Jim Armogida (“School of Rock,” “Grounded for Life”) is as insipid as it seems or if that laugh track is just throwing things off balance and stifling the rhythm. Much of “Punky Brewster” would be funnier, and perhaps even endearing, if it weren’t trying quite so hard to be both.</td>

      <td>Move by Jair Bolsonaro to place army general atop oil giant seen as meddling in state firm</td>
      <td>SÃO PAULO—The financial future of Brazilian oil giant  Petrobras  hung in the balance Tuesday as its board met to decide whether to approve President Jair Bolsonaro’s controversial appointment of an army general to the company’s helm in an apparent bid to force the firm to subsidize fuel prices.<br />Mr. Bolsonaro’s nomination of Gen. Joaquim Silva e Luna, who served alongside him under Brazil’s 1964-85 dictatorship and has no experience in the oil industry, has roiled markets, wiping billions of dollars off Petrobras’s market value and raising fears about government meddling in the economy.<br />While the board meeting was scheduled to end late Tuesday, people close to the deliberations said the 11 members may delay the decision on whether to back the president’s move or defy him. A delay will only create more uncertainty, analysts said, prompting possible further losses at the company.<br />Petrobras’s shares on Tuesday climbed 8%, recovering some of the ground lost the day before, when they plunged roughly 20%, the second-biggest daily loss in market value since the early 1990s, according to Economatica, a São Paulo-based analysis firm. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stocks index rose 2% by Tuesday afternoon and the real strengthened slightly against the dollar.<br />The right-wing president’s intervention at Petrobras was widely seen among investors as a pivotal moment in his two-year-old administration, a sign that he was going to put politics above economics ahead of his 2022 re-election bid. Subsidizing fuel prices would likely cost the state firm billions of dollars a year, crippling its finances and diminishing its ability to find and produce more oil.</td>

Many residents also lost access to water, and 14.6 million were ordered to boil water to make it safe to drink. Power had been restored in most of the state by Tuesday morning, but 7.5 million people in 204 counties remained under boil-water orders.<br />So far, nearly 80 people have died a result of the storm and its effects, according to the Associated Press.<br />An 11-year-old boy was found frozen in his bed, his family told the Houston Chronicle. A grandmother and three grandchildren died in a house fire as they were trying to stay warm, the Chronicle also reported. At least six deaths occurred near the Abilene area, local media reported, including a patient who couldn’t get medical treatment due to a lack of water and three elderly men who were found dead in subfreezing homes.<br />Harris County, which includes Houston, has confirmed at least 15 hypothermia deaths and one fatal fall on ice, according to its forensics institute. Several others died from carbon-monoxide poisoning after taking unsafe measures to stay warm, according to the county’s top executive. In Travis County, which includes Austin, the medical examiner’s office is busy processing more than 80 cases from last week to determine causes of death, an official said.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia may be the most vocal Democrat sharing his concerns about the minimum-wage increase included in his party’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill—but he isn’t the only one with misgivings.<br />As the House prepares to pass the relief bill later this week and send it to the Senate, Democratic leaders will have to contend with the quieter but broader pack of Senate Democrats who have problems with the legislation. And in order for Democrats to pass the bill without GOP support, they can’t afford to lose a single vote within their own ranks.<br />Mr. Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona are the only two Democrats to say outright they oppose increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, up from $7.25 currently. But 10 other Senate Democrats haven’t signed onto stand-alone legislation increasing the minimum wage to that level, and some have voiced objections to the current structure of the pay boost, setting the stage for possible revisions.<br />“Everyone is going to have things that they want to see in the bill, and we’ll work hard to see if we can get those things in the bill, but job number one is to pass the bill,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) told reporters Tuesday.<br />The legislation, which is backed by President Biden and expected to pass the House later this week, would provide $400-a-week unemployment benefits through Aug. 29, send $1,400 per-person payments to most households, provide billions in funding for schools and vaccine distribution, expand the child tax credit, broaden child-care assistance and bolster tax credits for health insurance.</td>

      <td>Your editorial “Texas Spins Into the Wind” (Feb. 18) misplaces the blame for the rolling blackouts in Texas on its “frozen turbines.” Here in Michigan, we have more than a thousand wind turbines that operate without failure in far more severe winter weather than Texas has ever seen. The difference is that our wind turbines are equipped with optional cold-weather packages; apparently the turbines in Texas are not. This is an extra-cost option that wind-turbine manufacturers offer, just as auto makers offer optional cold-weather packages for the cars they sell. Michigan gas pipelines and power plants are also winterized, and continue to operate in severe weather. It isn’t the fault of wind-turbine technology that some of the wind turbines in Texas froze; it was the result of a cost-cutting purchase decision that backfired.<br />This isn’t the first time. Ten years ago, in February 2011, Texas had unusually cold weather that led to power plant failures (both wind and gas) causing 3.2 million customers to lose power. Then, as now, more power was lost from frozen gas facilities than frozen wind turbines; only 6% of their electricity came from wind at that time. There was an investigation, of course. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reported a key finding: “The lack of any state, regional or reliability standards that directly require generators to perform winterization left winter-readiness dependent on plant or corporate choices.” Texas power producers could have equipped their wind turbines and gas systems for this weather.

Meanwhile, the Senate confirmed Linda Thomas-Greenfield as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Tom Vilsackas agriculture secretary. Merrick Garland, Mr. Biden’s nominee for attorney general, is also expected to be confirmed with bipartisan support next month.<br />California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, Mr. Biden’s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, faced questions Tuesday from Republicans who said he is too liberal and lacks public-health experience. “I’ll say what I’ve said to him privately. I’m not sold yet,” said Sen.

Deb Haaland (D., N.M.), Mr. Biden’s nominee for interior secretary, at a separate hearing and wanted to hear more from her.<br />Mr. Biden’s nominees can win confirmation in the Senate without Republican votes as long as all Democrats support them. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) is undecided on both Mr. Becerra and Ms. Haaland, his office said, and he threw Ms. Tanden’s nomination to lead OMB into doubt late last week when he said he would oppose confirming her.</td>

What comes to mind is the contradiction between President Biden’s pronounced priorities and the real-world impact of his early achievements, such as they are.<br />Shutting down the Keystone XL pipeline works against his overarching desire to move toward full employment. In addition, the alternatives to movement of oil by pipeline will exacerbate our carbon footprint and global-warming concerns. The minimum wage of $15 per hour guarantees a net reduction in entry-level jobs across the country and has dire consequences for very small businesses. Strong statements on foreign-affairs matters that have nothing behind them diminish U.S. influence, don’t inspire “global admiration for U.S. values” and are a disservice to our allies abroad. Close affiliation with Black Lives Matter doesn’t send a positive message to the overall U.S. population. The actual implications of President Biden’s policies as currently advanced don’t enhance peace and prosperity. Notwithstanding his stated intentions, the impact of early initiatives have the Biden bus headed in the wrong direction.<br />Randal S. Scott<br />Fairfax, Va.</td>

      <td>In Netflix’s six-part documentary, historian interviews and bloody re-enactments tell the story of the country’s civil war.</td>
      <td>The ostensible subjects of “Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan” are dubbed “the mounted knights of old Japan” and while a properly romantic description, it falls a bit short: The sword-wielding martial artists of the feudal era (1185-1868) have not only taken up residence in the Western imagination but created ornate, interlacing connections between pop cultures East and West. Akira Kurosawa, for instance, who was a student of John Ford, portrayed his heroes like the gunslingers of the Old West, or even Prohibition gangsters. Detective novelist Dashiell Hammett’s 1929 “Red Harvest” was the basis for Kurosawa’s “Yojimbo,” which in turn inspired Sergio Leone’s “A Fistful of Dollars,” which inspired the Bruce Willis movie “Last Man Standing.” Beneath all the intersecting fictional mayhem lay feudal roots. Most of us samurai-movie fans just don’t know where or what they are.<br />The experts in “Age of Samurai” certainly do. And they tell far more than the average viewer is going to be able to consume over the six parts of the documentary series, which is devoted to the history, traditions and politics not just of the samurai but of Japan itself. It is as much about the “Age” as of the “Samurai” and follows a familiar path familiar to Netflix documentary viewers: Historians and other academics and authors comment on the story being retold, while dramatic re-creations follow it—often, in this case, to harrowing effect. According to one of the interviewees, samurai, a word that originally meant “servant,” were “probably the greatest warriors the world has ever known.” This is precisely the kind of unprovable hype that might turn a viewer off, though the dramatic portions of the program strive to make it seem so: The descriptions, accounts and dramatic re-enactments of the “melee combat” conducted with the legendary katana (samurai swords) result in geysers of blood, rolling heads and certainly are meant to impress viewers with not just the degree but the intimacy of the violence that occurred between rival clans, which used the samurai as their infantry.<br />It’s a fascinating narrative retold and begins here in 1551 with the death of Oda Nobuhide, head of the powerful Oda clan at a time when the central government of Japan had collapsed and incited civil wars across the country among the various power- and land-hungry daimyo, or warlords. The principal character, beginning with episode 1, is Oda Nobunaga, the unpredictable, bloodthirsty and ultimately brilliant son of Nobuhide who would become the first “great unifier” of Japan, but not before modernizing military strategies and introducing firearms into what was previously an arena of hand-to-hand combat.<br />“Age of Samurai” has an international cast of academicians, some quite captivating, on hand to deliver a historically substantiated account of the samurai and their emerging nation. They include the historian-authors Stephen Turnbull, David Spafford, Tomoko Kitagawa and others, all of whom seem to agree on almost everything that happened, which seems odd: Aren’t historians supposed to disagree? One might expect more clashing of academic katanas, but they are as unified as Japan would be, more or less, when the feudal bloodletting was over.</td>

      <td>Men whose style skews casual are zeroing in on the coziest things around: outrageously soft fleece trousers</td>
      <td>IF YOU BELIEVE that shlumpy, elastic-waisted sweatpants sit at the extreme end of casual wear, well, you are wrong. Push further into the realm of comfort and you will find fuzzy fleece pants, perhaps the most notable achievement in wearable coziness. Cut like a roomy sweatpant (often with a similarly accommodating elastic waist) but fabricated in a highly insulating plush material, fleece pants are like a Patagonia Retro-X jacket transplanted onto your legs. Could it get any cozier than that?<br />Fleece pants are not a recent creation. Back in the 1990s, Gene Han, the owner of Hatchet Outdoor Supply Co., a clothing shop with locations in Brooklyn and Los Angeles, recalls seeing fleece pants from labels like ACG— Nike ’s  techy, hiking-inspired sub-label. This winter, though, he’s witnessed an unprecedented demand for his shop’s stock of the teddy-bear-plush pants from nature-focused labels Gramicci and Manastash. “We are totally sold out….I wanted some for myself while I’m stuck at home and I couldn’t even pick them up,” he said.<br />It’s not just that they’re stupendously soft. Mr. Han (whose shop also sells sweatpants) considers fleece pants toastier and therefore “superior” to sweats. Converts concur. Fleece pants are “like wearing a blanket for each of your legs,” said Kyle Bevilacqua, 36, a New Jersey-based corporate tax attorney who bought a pair of furry fleece trousers from New York’s 18 East about a year ago. Mr. Bevilacqua, who is a runner, initially got the pants because he wanted “something super warm to wear” to winter races.<br />As a source of insulation, the fleece pants exceeded his expectations and have since infiltrated his daily winter wardrobe. He wears them with waffle-knit sweaters and, for maximum coziness, a fleece sweatshirt. On super cold days, Mr. Bevilacqua said, “they became this really great thing to throw on to run out and grab a coffee or just take a walk around town.” The highly textural trousers also provoke envying comments: “I’ve gotten a few ‘those look so incredibly warm.’”<br />Kendall Riley, 29, a software consultant in Lawrence, Kan., snags compliments, too, when he wears one of his three pairs of Gramicci fleece pants, which are cut a bit like a straight-legged five-pocket jean. “I had someone say that ‘they’re really fun,’” he said. Recently, he posted a photo of himself in the fluffy bottoms on Instagram and a friend’s mother messaged him to ask where she could get them for her son. Mr. Riley tends to pair the fluffy pants with simple fare like a navy sweatshirt or a matching tan Patagonia fleece.</td>

      <td>Cruise line shares are trading up on reopening hopes alone</td>
      <td>If you are confused by the savage recovery of so-called “reopening” stocks, you are clearly overthinking things. Yes, sectors like hotels, amusement parks and casinos are soaring, even as revenues remain severely depressed. But markets’ new mantra seems to channel the age-old design principle: “Keep it simple, stupid.”<br />Look no further than cruise stocks. Shares of the three major cruise lines are up an average of 53% over the past six months, even though there has been little in the way of an actual restart in the industry. As  Royal Caribbean  Group’s chief executive officer, Richard Fain, said on his company’s fourth-quarter conference call Monday, most of its ships are still sitting idle after almost a year, and most of its global operations have been suspended at least through April. Meanwhile, Carnival Corp. apparently has decided that if it can’t sell cruise tickets, it will just sell stock instead. The company said on Monday it was raising $1 billion in common stock, also indicative of strong investor demand for the sidelined industry.<br />Hope floats, apparently. Estimates compiled by Visible Alpha show analysts expect Royal Caribbean’s revenue to remain down from 2019 levels by 74% this year and not exceed pre-pandemic levels until 2023. UBS analyst Robin Farley argues that while bookings look to be down for the second half of this year on an absolute basis compared with a normal year, booking volume is likely to be well above service capacity, given cruise lines’ plan for a phased re-entry of select ships at a time. She also noted cumulative advance bookings for the first half of next year are within historical ranges and seem to be at higher prices, a sign of pent-up consumer demand.<br />An analysis of booking trends done by cruise review site Cruise Critic is also encouraging. The site said it saw a 40% increase in cruise shoppers in January versus December, with the majority of bookings for trips this year rather than next year. But future cruising may be contingent upon certain protocol being put in place: 81% of Cruise Critic readers polled in January and February said they would cruise if there was a vaccination requirement to sail. While it is still unclear at this point what the regulations will be for future passengers to cruise, Royal Caribbean’s Mr. Fain did refer to vaccines as “the ultimate weapon” on Monday.<br />Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Woronka argued in a note this week that historically it has “proven unwise to fight a thesis trade”—in this case pent-up demand for vacations—no matter what consensus expectations may be. The risk, he notes ironically, is that analysts’ forecasts will catch up to or even exceed those of investors. This would set the stocks up for disappointment if actual earnings fall short of estimates once cruising resumes.</td>

Andrew Cuomo did something wrong in his handling of Covid-19 in the state’s nursing homes, according to a poll released Tuesday.<br />The poll by Marist College Institute for Public Opinion found the Democratic governor’s job-approval rating had slipped below 50%. Of the 953 adults surveyed Feb. 15 to 17, 49% said they approved and 44% said they disapproved of the job he is doing. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.<br />“Cuomo’s approval rating, which was sky high in the summer, has returned to its pre-pandemic level,” Marist Poll Director Lee M. Miringoff said. “Should Cuomo decide to seek a fourth term, these results suggest it will be a challenge. That said, his current numbers are comparable to what they were when he faced the voters last time.”<br />It is the third poll released amid weeks of rising criticism of the way Mr. Cuomo’s administration delayed a fuller accounting of the number of New Yorkers who died at long-term-care facilities. Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Mr. Cuomo, said the results varied between polls, and two other surveys showed the governor’s job approval above 50%.<br />“We remain focused on fighting this pandemic, administering as many vaccines as possible, and safely and smartly reopening our state,” Mr. Azzopardi said.</td>

      <td>New research shows rampant loneliness among Americans, with young adults and mothers among the most vulnerable. Here are ways to help.</td>
      <td>The coronavirus pandemic has caused another kind of pervasive affliction, Harvard researchers say: loneliness.<br />More than one-third of 950 Americans reported feeling lonely at least “frequently” in the previous four weeks, according to a newly released survey by researchers at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, conducted in October. That’s higher than the quarter of respondents who recalled feeling serious loneliness in the two months before the pandemic, and 28% of respondents said they had experienced increases in the frequency of their loneliness. Young adults and mothers felt especially isolated, the survey reported.<br />Social disruption has hit people in myriad ways: A college student living back at home may feel disconnected from their normal social life, while an overworked parent may feel detached from their usual support system. And even people managing to cultivate an active Zoom-led social life may still feel disconnected.<br />But it is possible to take steps to reduce loneliness, says Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer in Harvard’s Graduate School of Education who directs the Making Caring Common project, which has studied community and interfamily relationships over the course of the pandemic.<br />Dr. Weissbourd spoke with the Journal about the rise in loneliness and what we can do about it.</td>

The fund employed so-called alternative strategies, including volatility and betting on and against stocks, according to disclosures.<br />Halting redemptions is an unusual move, since mutual funds offer freedom to cash out at any time, and it suggests severe problems at the firm. Third Avenue Management LLC halted redemptions in one of its credit funds in 2015, a move that shocked the market, left a black mark on the firm and spurred worries about the wider bond market.<br />Infinity Q said in a statement that the firm is “cooperating with the SEC investigation” and has cut off Mr. Velissaris’s access to trading.</td>

      <td>Senate Republicans are eager to get aid where it’s needed, reopen schools and encourage work.</td>
      <td>Democrats are anxious for any excuse to blow up the Senate filibuster, the last procedural hurdle to one-party government. Their latest is that Republicans oppose the president’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package. Despite having passed five bipartisan Covid-19 relief bills to date—including one barely seven weeks ago—they claim our opposition demonstrates historic intransigence.<br />No, it demonstrates that the $1.9 trillion bill is a clunker. It would waste hundreds of billions of dollars, do nothing meaningful to get kids back to school, and enact policies that work against job creation. The Congressional Budget Office’s recent analysis of the plan found that more than a third of the proposed funding—$700 billion—wouldn’t be spent until 2022 or later, undermining the administration’s claim that the massive price tag is justified for urgent pandemic-related needs.<br />The Biden stimulus is unsound economic policy. High unemployment isn’t the result of too little money in American pockets; it’s because of the pandemic. Sending out checks won’t get consumers back into restaurants, bars, salons, malls, hotels or airplanes. Near-record levels of savings are evidence that consumers are able to spend. When Covid is finally in the rearview mirror, they will come roaring back. Congress should target assistance to those who need it and help speed the delivery of vaccines—not borrow hundreds of billions more to check items off a political wish list, deepening the nation’s debt and risking inflation.<br />The bill is also filled with bad policies and sloppy math. It calls for $350 billion for states and localities. If you live in New York, you might think that sounds about right because the pandemic severely exacerbated your state’s existing financial woes. But New York is the exception. Florida hasn’t even had to dip into its rainy-day fund. California has a multibillion-dollar surplus. Utah’s revenues rose by double digits.<br />JP Morgan  found that 21 states had revenue increases in 2020. Other states drew on rainy-day funds—which is what they are there for. Only a few are in severe financial distress. The same is true of cities and counties: Some are hurting, but the great majority aren’t. Most local tax revenue comes from property taxes, which are far less volatile than sales or income taxes. Sending out hundreds of billions of dollars to states and localities regardless of need is both wasteful and harmful. It would create incentives for the mismanagement that got some states into fiscal trouble in the first place.</td>

      <td>Beijing is obsessed with viruses, but not biosafety. We are paying a high price for its lapses.</td>
      <td>The Chinese Communist Party is obsessed with viruses. Its army of scientists claim to have discovered almost 2,000 new viruses in a little over a decade. It took the past 200 years for the rest of the world to discover that many. More troubling is the party’s negligence on biosafety. The costs and the risk to world health are enormous, as evidenced by a novel coronavirus that escaped Wuhan. This situation can’t continue. The world must hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable and punish Beijing if it fails to uphold global biosafety standards, including basic transparency requirements.<br />The most recent example of this malfeasance is playing out around us. The evidence that the virus came from Wuhan is enormous, though largely circumstantial, and most signs point to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or WIV, as the source of Covid-19. In America, concern about the site is now broad and bipartisan. The Biden administration stated that it has “deep concerns” about the World Health Organization’s investigation into the early days of the pandemic, particularly Beijing’s interference with the investigators’ work.<br />The world has known for a long time that WIV poses a huge risk to global health. Two 2018 State Department cables warned of its biosafety problems. They even predicted that SARS-CoV-2’s ACE2 receptor, identified by WIV scientists, would enable human-to-human transmission. Yuan Zhiming, then director of WIV’s biosafety level 4 lab, warned, “The biosafety laboratory is a double-edge sword: It can be used for the benefit of humanity, but can also lead to a disaster.” He listed the shortfalls prevalent among China’s biology labs, including a lack of “operational technical support, professional instructions” and “feasible standards for the safety requirements of different protection zones and for the inoculation of microbiological animals and equipment.”<br />The Chinese public took note, with several bloggers alleging that WIV’s virus-carrying animals are sold as pets. They may even show up at local wet markets. After the Wuhan outbreak, one since-disappeared blogger asked a WIV researcher to debate the lab’s biosafety practices in public. The offer was ignored.<br />Beijing has a moral and legal obligation to take biosafety seriously, especially given the kind of research going on at WIV. In 2015, WIV’s Dr. Shi Zhengli co-wrote an article titled “A SARS-like Cluster of Circulating Bat Coronaviruses Shows Potential for Human Emergence” in which she admitted that her team had engineered “chimeric” and “hybrid” viruses from horseshoe bats. In a 2019 article titled “Bat Coronavirus in China,” Ms. Shi and her co-authors warned, “It is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China.” At the time, WIV housed tens of thousands of bat virus samples and experiment animals.</td>

That comes with one benefit: Every sign of life can be enough to keep investors on board.<br />Macy’s did have a better holiday season than expected. Net sales were down 18.7% in the quarter ended Jan. 30 compared with a year earlier, better than the 22.6% decline that analysts polled by Visible Alpha expected. But that was still a steeper revenue decline than the 14.4% drop that department stores around the country experienced over the same period, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.<br />The retailer also benefited from fewer product returns compared with previous holiday seasons—thanks in large part to customers buying less clothes. Home, beauty, jewelry and watch categories were popular this holiday season.<br />Net income was a positive surprise, coming in at $160 million compared with the $14.3 million analysts expected. That was mostly thanks to greatly reduced operating expenses. The department store chain reduced operating costs by $900 million for the full year and expects to keep expenses at that depressed level going forward. For the full year, Macy’s incurred a net loss of $3.9 billion.<br />It is important to remember that behind Macy’s cost reductions are expectations that it will sell less going forward. Macy’s thinks fiscal 2021 net sales will be 15.5% lower than fiscal 2019 levels at the high end of its guidance. That’s not a high bar: Sales also declined in 2019.</td>

The research showed that Black Americans feel underserved with news coverage choices, and that the community is an untapped driver of economic growth.</td>

      <td>Nasdaq was down modestly but on track to extend losing streak to six sessions</td>
      <td>Tech stocks bounced back from their worst open in months Tuesday, after prepared testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell cooled the rate fears that have fueled a late February rout.<br />Many major stocks were down but only modestly so.  Tesla Inc.  had fallen 2% after dropping as much as 12% in early trading, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1% after an early decline of 4% put it on track for its worst day since September. The index is down 6% from its peak Feb. 12, as rising U.S. interest rates prompt a broad re-evaluation of investor growth expectations, and on track for a sixth straight decline—its longest pullback in a year.<br />Tesla, whose 743% surge last year highlighted the tech-led market rebound from the coronavirus selloff, is now down for 2021 and has lost a quarter of its value since the electric-car maker said on Feb. 8 that it had spent $1.5 billion on bitcoin in an effort to boost returns on cash.<br />Other investor favorites were also recovering after being hit hard in early trading.  Moderna Inc.,  the maker of a major Covid-19 vaccine, was down 7% after falling as much as 13%.  Apple Inc.  dropped 2% and  Amazon.com Inc.  fell 1%.<br />The tech companies have emerged as favorites among small investors who have piled into stock and options trading over the past year, with the Nasdaq rising 44% in 2020. But the scale of the rally has prompted concerns that many of the stocks are overvalued, making them vulnerable to sudden slumps.</td>

      <td>Schools are getting billions they can spend over nearly a decade.</td>
      <td>Perhaps you’ve heard that the $1.9 trillion House spending bill is meant to provide “urgent” and “emergency” relief. But did you know that the Covid emergency in America’s schools will apparently last through 2028?<br />The House proposal showers K-12 schools with nearly $129 billion. That’s on top of the $13.2 billion allocated in last spring’s Cares Act and the $54.3 billion in December’s bipartisan splurge. According to the Congressional Budget Office, schools have spent only a fraction of that previous $67.5 billion. It’s hard to spend money when schools aren’t open for classroom instruction since unions have resisted returning to work in much of the country.<br />Because of this leftover cash, CBO estimates that a mere $6.4 billion of the new aid package will be spent for K-12 schools in the 2021 fiscal year. That’s right—only $6 billion of $129 billion will be spent during the pandemic emergency.<br />CBO estimates that $32.1 billion will be spent in fiscal 2022 on K-12 schools, $32.1 billion in 2023, $25.7 billion in 2024, $19.3 billion in 2025, $9 billion in 2026, $2.6 billion in 2027, and $1.3 billion in 2028.<br />In other words, this isn’t about Covid relief. School districts can spend the funds on a wide range of options—from sanitizing classrooms to “continuing to employ existing staff of the local educational agency”—and the money is fungible. This means that, after the pandemic eases perhaps as soon as this year, school districts are likely to use the money to pad their bureaucracies and teacher payrolls. One of the bill’s few limitations is that local educational agencies must spend 20% of their funds to address “learning loss” with interventions such as summer school or extended-day programs. This would require more money for teacher pay or additional hiring for union dues-paying positions.</td>

That was exponentially higher than the average price, which was $21.18 per megawatt hour in 2020, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or Ercot, the nonprofit that controls the grid.<br />Now power retailers and municipal utilities are trying to figure out how to pass on the billions of dollars in costs to customers, some of whom face bills in the thousands of dollars that may need to be stretched out over time.<br />In Denton, a North Texas university city that suffered outages and natural-gas supply shortages, city leaders are looking to borrow up to $300 million to cover fuel expenses from last week, which amounts to around $2,000 for each of the city’s 150,000 residents.</td>

Iran has rejected direct negotiations with the U.S., as long as American sanctions remain in place and the U.S. remains outside the 2015 deal. But European officials have warned Iran in recent days that it risks deepening its isolation if it misses the opportunity for direct talks with Biden administration officials, who would attend as guests in the informal meeting.<br />“These diplomatic contacts have to be discreet but I am reasonably optimistic” that Iran will join talks, the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said Monday.<br />Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei said Tuesday that Iran was “looking into the European side’s proposal of an informal meeting for a dialogue.”<br />Meanwhile, citing the U.S. refusal to lift sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, Iran on Tuesday followed through on a previous threat, saying it would no longer grant United Nations inspectors daily access to its nuclear facilities, or provide round-the-clock security footage of its activities at these sites. Iran will also bar the U.N. atomic agency from inspecting other sites where it suspects nuclear-related work might be taking place.</td>

      <td>Democrats’ $1.9 trillion relief package includes stimulus payments, jobless benefits, vaccine funding and more</td>
      <td>Democrats in Congress are racing to meet a mid-March deadline for President Biden’s coronavirus relief package before existing benefits like enhanced unemployment insurance expire. Here’s an overview of the $1.9 trillion legislation, which they are looking to pass with only Democratic votes. The package includes some elements, such as a $15 minimum wage, that might not survive intraparty negotiations or Senate rules.<br />The House and Senate passed a budget resolution earlier this month that allows them to craft a $1.9 trillion relief package. The size of the package has stayed the same since it was unveiled by President-elect Biden during the transition period, and after he rebuffed a proposal by a group of 10 Republicans who argued for a $618 billion bill.<br />The Biden administration says the package is the right size and that the economy needs relief on that scale in order to bring down real unemployment rates that the Federal Reserve estimates to be around 10%—accounting for misclassifications in government data and people who have exited the labor force—and to alleviate the economic hardship faced by millions whose lives and jobs have been disrupted.<br />“We think it’s very important to have a big package that addresses the pain this has caused,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently.<br />But Republicans have pointed to falling infection rates and unspent funds from previous relief packages as a reason to wait on any further stimulus. Meanwhile, many private economists have raised their growth outlooks for the year.</td>

      <td>Cryptocurrency prices fall sharply as enthusiasm for risky assets pauses</td>
      <td>This year’s furious rally in cryptocurrencies lost steam Tuesday, knocking prices for bitcoin and ether from recent highs, alongside drops in other risky assets including tech stocks.<br />Bitcoin fell 11% to $47,145 after hitting a record of $58,332 Sunday, according to CoinDesk. The decline lowered its market cap—the value of all bitcoin in circulation—to $878 billion, down from more than $1 trillion last week. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by total market value, fell almost 13% to $1,523.<br />A broad turn in markets toward caution, coupled with historically high prices, likely triggered the correction, analysts and investors said.<br />“The types of moves we were seeing in 2021 were parabolic,” said Joel Kruger, a strategist at cryptocurrency exchange LMAX Digital. “When you see moves like that, it’s obvious these markets are going to be due for a pullback.”<br />Assets—crypto or otherwise—that gained the most during the pandemic have slipped in recent days as investors bet on economies opening up. U.S. government bond yields have risen to their highest level in a year. When yields on safe bonds rise, that makes speculative assets, such as cryptocurrencies and shares in companies with profits far in the future, less attractive.</td>

      <td>A much-anticipated strategic update continues the bank’s frustratingly slow pivot toward Asia, only with lower shareholder returns</td>
      <td>Another year, another familiar-sounding strategic update at  HSBC .  The behemoth’s need to reiterate its pivot to Asia underlines what a slow, awkward process it is.<br />The London-headquartered, China-focused bank announced full-year results on Tuesday. As at peers, revenues were hit by lower interest rates globally and chunky allowances for pandemic-related loan losses. Unlike at investment-banking rivals, the bump in trading revenues from HSBC’s own trimmed-back business was a meager offset. A much-anticipated new strategy amounted to more of the same—except for lowered shareholders returns.<br />The shares fell in early trading, extending a year of underperformance. For much of the past decade the stock has traded at a premium to most European peers because of HSBC’s strong business in Hong Kong and mainland China, both profitable, fast-growing markets. But that gap has narrowed considerably in the past year, likely for two main reasons: Investors want faster organizational change, and they are concerned that HSBC’s trademark business model of bridging East and West is getting more difficult.<br />The bank broadly delivered on its 2020 targets. However, return on tangible equity or ROTE fell to just 3.1% from 8.4% a year earlier, and dividends were suspended at the British regulator’s request. The pandemic seems a valid excuse. The real disappointment was in its guidance for future returns. Target ROTE has been reduced and delayed, even with an additional $1 billion in cost cuts. Dividend expectations were pared back too: The growing quarterly payment has been replaced with a 40% to 55% payout ratio, possibly topped up with buybacks or special dividends.<br />Strategically, the bank is still focused on shifting more assets from Europe and the U.S. into Asia, as well as increasing its wealth management business and making its operations more digital. The direction of travel makes sense, but the pace remains frustratingly sedate, particularly as competition in the region is picking up. Discussions continue about long-mooted exits from retail operations in France and the U.S.</td>

Additionally, Tether agreed to publicly release quarterly statements detailing its reserves.<br />The attorney general’s office said the companies made several public misrepresentations, regarding the dollar reserves backing for tether in 2017 and a situation in 2018 when Bitfinex lost access to about $850 million of its customers’ funds that it had placed with an outside company.<br />When Bitfinex lost those customer funds, it borrowed money from the tether reserves to cover the loss, something it didn’t disclose publicly. That money has since been paid back, though Bitfinex is still trying to recover the original $850 million.<br />The settlement ends a long-running saga that had been keenly followed in the crypto industry. Both Bitfinex and tether are key cogs in the trading markets. If the attorney general’s office had charged them criminally, it could have had ramifications for the market as a whole.</td>

Several of the canceled projects fell within China’s world-wide infrastructure initiative, Belt and Road, which has disappointed several participating countries.<br />The shift is largely taking place in smaller European countries, adding to tensions within the European Union, where big countries still largely favor maintaining business links with China.<br />Romania and Lithuania are taking broad measures to exclude Chinese companies from certain public procurements. Other moves are more targeted. Authorities in Slovenia, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Romania have suspended public tenders involving Chinese companies for work on nuclear-power plants, highways, rail lines, security scanners and a shipping-container terminal.

Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Startups often offer stock as part of an employee’s pay. Wilson Sonsini created its own stock-plan software decades ago to help clients track the value of their employees’ holdings as companies matured from early-stage startups and raised outside money to finance their growth.<br />Morgan Stanley is pushing into stock-plan administration as an early entree into the financial lives of a new generation of customers. Some of those clients, the bank hopes, will turn to it for more lucrative services, such as advice, as their needs grow more complex. The digitization of finance has unleashed low- or no-cost services, such as commission-free trades and zero-fee investment funds, that money managers are deploying to attract new clients.<br />The Wilson Sonsini agreement aims to give Morgan Stanley a leg up in cementing connections with startups and their employees before a possible public offering. Some will become millionaires overnight; Google Inc., LinkedIn,  Twitter Inc.  and  Lyft Inc.  are among the companies the law firm helped take public.<br />Morgan Stanley paid $900 million to acquire Solium Capital Inc. in 2019, adding a platform that specialized in privately held firms and last year bought E*Trade Financial Corp., which manages stock plans for hundreds of companies, for $13 billion.</td>

      <td>Software vendor’s CEO, other tech executives to testify about breach that involved a tool used widely in the government and private sector</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Senators are expected to probe the origins and fallout of a devastating hack of federal government computer systems Tuesday, when the chief executive officer of the software vendor  SolarWinds Corp.  testifies about the compromise of his firm by suspected Russian agents in what officials have described as one of the worst U.S. intelligence failures on record.<br />The hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee is the first since the so-called SolarWinds hack was discovered in December. Sudhakar Ramakrishna, president and chief executive of SolarWinds, is scheduled to testify about his company’s handling of the breach, along with other technology executives whose companies and products were ensnared in the attack or have helped respond to it.<br />That hack is one of the most significant yet to be probed by Congress. Previous headline breaches in recent years, such as those at the Office of Personnel Management,  Equifax Inc.  and a spate of retail hacks at stores like  Target Corp. , prompted hearings but generally haven’t spurred Congress to pass substantive cybersecurity legislation.<br />Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the new Democratic chairman of the committee, has said he would make scrutiny of the SolarWinds episode a priority of his panel. He said he hoped the severity of the attack would reinvigorate debate on legislative and policy proposals, including a reconsideration of a national data breach notification law.<br />“We get these blips of interest in cyber and then it fades,” Mr. Warner said in an interview earlier this month. The SolarWinds hack raised broader questions about the security of software supply chains on which the government relies, Mr. Warner said. “We are still trying to learn how big, how broad, how much it is going to cost to remediate,” he said.</td>

      <td>Puerto Rico moved closer to resolving the largest municipal-debt default in U.S. history after creditors owed roughly $11.7 billion backed a settlement framework, the most Wall Street support yet amassed for a restructuring of the territory’s core public debts.<br />The proposed settlement released Tuesday would reduce roughly $18.8 billion in general obligation debt to roughly $7.4 billion, lowering interest payments to bondholders to levels that Puerto Rico’s financial supervisors believes it can support after years of population loss and economic decline.<br />Some bonds covered by the deal have gained value in recent months, buoyed by fixed-income investors’ appetite for high-yielding municipal debt and expectations that Puerto Rico’s court-supervised bankruptcy is nearing its end. The agreement marks the culmination of months of private talks between finance officials and creditors to assess the long-term damage to Puerto Rico’s economy stemming from Covid-19.<br />Investment firms that participate would exchange their claims for a mix of cash, restructured bonds and tradable securities known as contingent value instruments that only pay out if sales-tax collections exceed certain projections.<br />A sustained rally in high-yield municipal bonds, including Puerto Rico’s, helped to ease the deal, according to bondholders and advisers involved in negotiations. Yield-hungry investors have been drawn to risky municipal bonds in part due to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s commitment to ultralow rates.</td>

The bid came from private-equity firms Stone Point Capital LLC and Insight Partners.<br />That bid won out over a competing all-stock offer at a nominally higher value from  CoStar Group Inc.,  one of the world’s largest providers of commercial real-estate data and online marketplaces.<br />But CoStar wasn’t ready to give up. Last week, it boosted its all-stock bid to about $96 a share at the time, or around $6.9 billion. That represented a premium of 17% to CoreLogic’s share price before CoStar made its offer.<br />If CoStar prevails, the Washington, D.C.-based data giant plans to use CoreLogic to challenge  Zillow Group Inc.  for dominance of the multibillion-dollar online home-sales marketplace. CoStar last year made its first push into the home-sales market by buying Homesnap Inc. for $250 million.</td>

But the recent surge in home prices there raises the prospect that the city could reclaim its status as a desirable seaside getaway.<br />Atlantic City home prices rose 30% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, making the New Jersey city one of the country’s biggest gainers, according to the National Association of Realtors. Prices continued to rise in January, jumping 35% compared with a year earlier, according to data collected by real-estate brokerage Redfin. New Jersey gambling revenue, meanwhile, tumbled 17% in 2020.<br />Atlantic City home-price gains followed efforts by local officials and real-estate investors to transform the town from a place where gamblers would try their luck at table games to a place where more people wanted to live and work permanently.<br />“They want to build up the Atlantic City economy where it’s based off of businesses and activities that are not casino related,” said Joshua Garay, a New York real-estate broker. Locals have pushed to create more jobs in the cybersecurity industry and to add more family friendly offerings, including a recently announced plan for an indoor water park on the boardwalk.<br />Mr. Garay is working with the owners of the former Atlantic Club Casino Hotel, which closed in 2014, to renovate its hotel and potentially to develop new condominiums. Other investors have begun building or have plans for new apartments, restaurants, hotels and other family-oriented attractions.</td>

Irving and former Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger. Robert Contee, the acting chief of Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department, also will face questioning.<br />The hearing is part of a wider bipartisan probe into the security failures that resulted in the breach of the Capitol by a mob of Donald Trump supporters that included members of far-right extremist groups.

Gary Peters (D., Mich.) and Rob Portman (R., Ohio), the chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and by Sens.

      <td>Coming fourth-quarter results may mark the peak of investor appetite</td>
      <td>DoorDash  is a newly minted $65 billion public food-delivery company trading near its highs just as the coronavirus is beginning to wane and restaurants are opening back up. What could possibly go wrong?<br />The nearest catalyst could be deceiving. The company is set to dish out fourth-quarter results on Thursday, its first report as a public company. All signs point to a capstone end to a phenomenal year for the platform, which now commands a seemingly untouchable 53% of the market, according to data released Friday by Edison Trends.<br />The fourth quarter is seasonally strong for food-delivery players, given cold weather and holidays, but Covid-19 has made 2020 a particular boon. Earlier this month,  Grubhub  said it grew sales 48% year over year in the fourth quarter, while  Uber Technologies  said its Uber Eats business grew revenue 224% in the same period. It makes sense, then, based on competitors’ performance, that investors would be bidding up DoorDash’s stock ahead of its earnings.<br />Uber has yet to turn a profit, but its shares are up 70% over the past year on its food-delivery growth, even as its ride-share bookings were down 43% as of January. Similarly, DoorDash said it lost money in the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, though its revenue more than tripled. As revenue growth inevitably moderates with comparisons becoming increasingly difficult as 2021 goes on, investors’ patience will be tested. Estimates compiled by Visible Alpha forecast another two years of losses ahead for the company.<br />DoorDash’s “first-to-market” growth strategy in the U.S. suburbs and in ancillary categories like convenience delivery have certainly served it well. But competitors are moving onto this turf. Grubhub, for example, said its own restaurant inventory increased 75% in 2020 in suburban and rural areas. And earlier this month, Uber said it was paying more than $1 billion to acquire alcohol-and-convenience delivery platform Drizly. While these moves are validating to DoorDash’s model, they also imply growth may be more costly.</td>

      <td>The largest U.S. financial regulator has turned its focus away from private equity in recent years, but new agency leadership could mean tougher enforcement and heavier fines for buyout firms, attorneys and lobbyists say.<br />President Biden’s nomination of Gary Gensler to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission has Wall Street firms bracing for stricter oversight. Mr. Gensler, a former partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., gained a reputation as an aggressive enforcer while running the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 2009 through 2013.<br />Mr. Gensler, who taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management after leaving government, has made few public statements of his views on private equity, however, and it is unclear whether he sees reforming buyout-fund practices as a priority.<br />Regulatory experts see a likelihood that if Mr. Gensler is confirmed by the Senate, the SEC could return to large, headline-making fines against private equity, which became less common under Jay Clayton, who led the agency from 2017 through 2020. Mr. Clayton last week said he would join the board of buyout firm  Apollo Global Management Inc.  as a lead independent director.<br />Mr. Gensler “got a lot done because he made a big splash” leading the CFTC, said Joe Weinstein, head of the securities and shareholder litigation practice at law firm and lobbying group Squire Patton Boggs. “I do think he’s going to try to send a message to whatever subset of the industry he is focusing on.”</td>

      <td>Home Depot Inc.  logged strong sales growth year over year for the November-to-January quarter and raised its dividend, but the company’s finance chief said that the trend could flatten this year as the company faces comparisons from its robust 2020 results.<br />Home Depot’s revenue in the latest quarter was $32.26 billion, a 25% increase compared with $25.78 billion in the same three-month period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast revenue of $30.63 billion in the quarter.<br />Over the full fiscal year, the company’s sales rose by 20% to $132.11 billion. That growth follows a broader trend of people spending more on home-related goods during the pandemic, as lockdowns and telecommuting focused attention on the home. The public-health crisis has also shifted consumer behavior in retailers’ favor by weighing on services spending, such as on travel, leisure and restaurants.<br />In the latest quarter, the number of Home Depot customer transactions rose 12.8% to 416.8 million, and the average transaction size grew to $75.69, from $68.29 in 2019’s fourth quarter. The company finished the quarter with 2,296 retail stores.<br />Home Depot Tuesday posted fourth-quarter earnings of $2.86 billion, or $2.65 a share, compared with $2.48 billion, or $2.28 a share, a year earlier.

      <td>The latest market gyrations are being driven by “real” rates rather than simply by inflation expectations. Investors may need to reassess their portfolios.</td>
      <td>Bonds are selling off again, but for different reasons. Investors also need to behave differently.<br />In the U.S., yields on 10-year Treasurys have risen close to 1.4%. Optimism about vaccination campaigns, as well as positive economic and corporate data, have led derivatives markets to price in a chance that the Federal Reserve will—very slowly—start raising interest rates as early as 2023. Yields started moving up consistently in October, which started with them under 0.7%.<br />Despite all the talk in financial markets about higher growth begetting inflation, however, this month’s gyrations have little to do with expectations of rising consumer prices. Rather, it is inflation-adjusted yields—as measured by inflation-linked Treasurys, or TIPS—that are edging higher.<br />This is the opposite of what was happening before February. Earlier bond selloffs were driven by expectations that the Fed would allow inflation to be higher in the future. Even if the central bank acted to tighten monetary policy at some point, the belief that it would do so by less than inflation meant that financial conditions would actually get looser in “real” terms. This made stocks appear more attractive, particularly in high-growth sectors like technology.<br />The flip side is that equity markets are looking less appetizing now. The S&P 500 fell 0.8% Monday, and is down 1.5% since Feb. 12. Tellingly, technology stocks have fallen more than 4% over the same period. Shares of financial companies, which would likely benefit from higher interest rates, have gained about 4%.</td>

Twitter’s moves came after the government threatened the company with legal action, which could have resulted in a fine or imprisonment for Twitter executives, if it didn’t remove the handles.<br />Twitter finds itself in an awkward position, analysts say, as it publicly stands by its commitment to allow individuals to express opinions while also abiding by New Delhi’s increasing assertiveness over social media. Twitter’s balancing act highlights a growing conundrum for social-media companies as they run up against governments in key markets where they seek growth as developed countries become saturated.<br />“The problem they face is striking the right balance between ideology and being pragmatic,” said Ashutosh Sharma, a New Delhi-based vice president at research firm Forrester. “Should they be taking sides? They have to be consistent.”<br />Twitter said in a statement earlier this month that it remains “committed to safeguarding the health of the conversation occurring on Twitter, and strongly believe that the Tweets should flow.”</td>

      <td>Music-streaming giant’s new ventures in podcasting, advertising and artist promotion have a high bar, as valuation has surged</td>
      <td>Spotify  sees itself as much more than a music-streaming platform. Investors have long since gotten there.<br />The company laid out an ambitious vision Monday during a two-hour webcast, touting new and coming offerings for listeners, musicians, podcasters and advertisers. These include a new high-fidelity music-streaming service for subscribers, more tools for musicians and podcasters to expand their revenue streams and significant international expansion that will take the service into 85 new markets this year. For podcasting—which has been of particular interest to investors—Spotify has added a new eight-episode series with former President Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen.<br />A news dump, in other words. And one that pleased investors initially, sending Spotify’s stock price up 5% before a broad-based tech selloff pushed the shares back down into the red by the end of trading Monday. Spotify is still up more than 11% since the start of the year and about 138% over the past 12 months, well outperforming other hot streaming names such as  Netflix  and  Disney .  Shares of  Warner Music Group ,  which as one of the world’s largest record labels controls some of the most sought-after music Spotify’s subscribers listen to, have actually lost about 4% so far this year.<br />Opportunities beyond music streaming are a key draw for Spotify’s investors right now. The stock’s big surge over the past year has mostly come from hype over new podcast deals, with the likes of Joe Rogan, Kim Kardashian and DC Comics. Even the royal family is getting in on the action; Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made a brief appearance in Monday’s event to tout their own exclusive Spotify podcast, coming later this year.<br />But while the number of podcasts on Spotify tripled last year to 2.2 million, the company has yet to break out any financial details of the venture. The highly popular “Joe Rogan Experience” became exclusive to Spotify on Dec. 1, but the company would only say on its fourth-quarter call on Feb. 4 that the program “contributed positively to user growth on the platform.” In a note following the results, Brian Russo of  Credit Suisse  said the company’s outlook for the current year “does little to suggest this content is driving an inflection in the business.”</td>

      <td>Treasury prices rally, but traders worry about a reversal if inflation picks up</td>
      <td>The spread between the two-year Treasury yield and a key interest rate set by the Federal Reserve is the narrowest since the depths of the coronavirus market selloff, a potential sign of financial-system stress.<br />The two-year Treasury yield, which closed Monday at 0.113%, is 0.013 percentage point above the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER. It traded as low as 0.105% earlier in February. The Fed pays banks on the reserves held above and beyond those required by central-bank regulatory policy as part of its effort to maintain liquidity in the financial system.<br />When the coronavirus sent markets and the economy into a tailspin in March, the Fed cut IOER by 1 percentage point to 0.10%—alongside other interventions—to shore up short-term lending markets and support economic activity. The spread between IOER and the two-year yield has typically been above 0.05 percentage point since the Fed cut the rate to its lowest level ever in March.<br />Traders said the shrinking of this spread reflects appetite for short-term debt as investors gobble up safe assets and park their cash. It also highlights a key tension point in financial markets: to what extent is Fed support for markets taking asset prices to unsustainable levels, and how vulnerable does that leave bond markets and other areas exposed to sudden reversals.<br />Analysts have been watching Treasury auction results to gauge whether increased fiscal spending and a supply surge of Treasury bonds would push short-term Treasury prices down and yields up. So far, that hasn’t happened. But bond traders are concerned that inflation could rise in coming months and years as the government prints money to support the economy and cover future borrowing costs.</td>

      <td>Potentially misleading disclosures related to the pandemic attract closer scrutiny from regulators</td>
      <td>After its business was hit by the pandemic, retailer  Ulta Beauty Inc.  appears to have used some accounting cosmetics to add a gloss to its financial results.<br />Operating income at the once-fast-growing chain, which temporarily closed stores during the health crisis, plummeted to $13 million for the nine months through October, a fraction of the $613 million earned in the same period in 2019. Two coronavirus-related items affected the math: a $40 million impairment charge for the value of some stores that reduced the operating income, and $51 million of federal tax credits that increased it.<br />Ulta also reported a much healthier $98 million “adjusted operating income.” This tally, designed to strip out one-time items, added back the $40 million impairment cost, which boosted the adjusted number, but didn’t take off the $51 million of federal aid. If that aid had been removed, the adjusted-operating-income number would have been half of what the company reported.<br />About a year into the pandemic, regulators are ramping up their scrutiny of potentially misleading coronavirus disclosures by companies. A senior Securities and Exchange Commission official warned in December that companies should be consistent in positive and negative adjustments when showing the impact of the pandemic.<br />An Ulta Beauty spokeswoman denied cherry-picking data to flatter the adjusted metric. She said the impairment cost was a legitimate one-time charge caused by the impact of Covid-19 on some stores, not a direct cost of the pandemic such as cleaning supplies.</td>

      <td>California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is expected to face a tough confirmation hearing Tuesday as Republicans are set to argue that President Biden’s pick for Health and Human Services secretary is overly liberal and lacks public-health experience.<br />Mr. Biden’s nominee enjoys support from Democrats to lead the sprawling, $1.2 trillion agency that sets national health policy and plays a chief role in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats have praised Mr. Becerra’s past work defending the Affordable Care Act and abortion access.<br />Mr. Becerra’s hearing Tuesday with the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will be followed by a hearing Wednesday with the Senate Finance Committee, which must vote to advance the confirmation to the floor for a full Senate vote.<br />In the evenly divided Senate, Democrats can confirm Mr. Biden’s nominees without any Republican votes, so long as they don’t lose any votes among their own ranks. Vice President Kamala Harris can cast a tiebreaking vote.<br />“We must ensure people have access to quality, affordable healthcare,” Mr. Becerra said in prepared remarks released ahead of Tuesday’s hearing. “If confirmed, I will work with you to strengthen our Medicare and Medicaid lifelines, reduce the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, and ensure we are accountable, spending resources wisely and effectively.”</td>

      <td>Banks, owners offer cheap rates and sometimes require little money down to unload unprofitable hotels</td>
      <td>The lodging industry is under such stress that some property sellers are willing to lend to prospective hotel buyers the way auto dealers finance vehicle sales: Offer cheap rates and sometimes with little money down.<br />Banks and owners want to get rid of unprofitable hotels that offer little near-term prospect for recovery. But unloading them at bargain prices would lead to losses on their balance sheets. So some are turning to what is known as seller financing.<br />With the typical hotel purchase, a property buyer pays the seller the full purchase price upfront and finances the deal in part with mortgages. But these loans have been harder to come by with the lodging business struggling.<br />Seller financing is the real-estate equivalent of buying a car with dealership financing. A hotel buyer pays only part of the price upfront, usually between 25% and 50%. The rest is treated as a loan from the seller to the buyer, and interest rates are often far lower than for traditional mortgages.<br />For sellers, the practice avoids painful write-downs in the present, but it also risks merely delaying a reckoning. By lending to the new owner, they remain tied to the hotel and at risk of losses if the still-soft lodging market doesn’t recover soon enough.</td>

The benchmark stocks gauge on Monday fell for a fifth consecutive day, its longest losing streak since last February. Contracts for the Nasdaq-100 retreated 0.6%, suggesting technology stocks will continue to lead the market lower.<br />A sharp rise in yields on U.S. government bonds in recent days has sapped investors’ appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. Shares in technology companies, which have powered the broader market higher for much of the past year, are seen as particularly vulnerable. That is because many tech companies’ valuations are tied to their future earnings potential. Those profits are less valuable in today’s terms when investors apply a higher discount rate.<br />The rise in bond yields “naturally does cause investors and cause markets to re-examine the view on equities,” said Paul Jackson, global head of asset allocation research at Invesco. Investing in government bonds is beginning to look more attractive for the first time in months, he said.<br />But “the level at which bond yields become truly problematic for equities is a long way from where we are now,” Mr. Jackson added.</td>

He was 90.<br />Mr. Yamani, who suffered from poor health for years, died in London, Saudi state TV announced Tuesday. He is expected to be buried in his hometown of Mecca, his former colleagues said. His son Hani Yamani said he had died on Monday.<br />He served in the post for nearly 25 years, starting in 1962. At that time, the U.S.—not Saudi Arabia—dominated the global oil trade as the world’s biggest producer and consumer of the commodity. The Texas Railroad Commission regulated domestic oil prices, while American and British companies held sway over a chunk of overseas production.<br />When Mr. Yamani took over the oil ministry, Saudi Arabia was a middling producer in the oil-rich Mideast. But Saudi Arabia’s deposits, it turns out, were much bigger than its neighbors’, and soon the country’s output was soaring. Amid a wave of oil field nationalizations across the region, Mr. Yamani led talks to take control of the Saudi Arabia Oil Co., then a joint venture between the predecessors to  Exxon Mobil Corp.  and  Chevron Corp.</td>

The legislation is being widely watched globally and could offer a model for other countries to compel tech giants to pay for content.<br />Facebook got some changes to the legislation as part of the deal. That includes requiring an additional round of negotiation with media companies before binding arbitration kicks in, as well as more acknowledgment of any deals Facebook reaches with publishers on its own, a government statement and government officials said Tuesday. In return, Facebook planned to restore news pages to its platform in Australia in the coming days, the statement said.<br />In a news conference, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told him that the company intends to strike commercial deals with Australian media organizations to pay for content. It did that later Tuesday, when Australian television and newspaper company Seven West Media Ltd. said it agreed to provide news to Facebook, though it didn’t immediately provide any details of the deal.<br />“There’s no doubt that Australia has been a proxy battle for the world,” Mr. Frydenberg said Tuesday. “Facebook and Google have not hidden the fact that they know that the eyes of the world are on Australia.”</td>

HSBC last year supported China’s imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong, which the U.S. and British governments opposed.<br />“We plan to focus on and invest in the areas in which we are strongest,” Mr. Quinn said. As part of that, the bank wants to be a market leader in serving rich Asian customers. Other areas that HSBC consider core include retail banking in Hong Kong and Britain, cross-border trade, and facilitating trade and capital flows into and across Asia.</td>

That loose blade apparently then sheared off part of a second blade that was also fractured, said Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, in a news conference Monday evening.<br />Mr. Sumwalt said investigators are probing why an outer covering known as a cowling detached, as well as why the damaged engine remained on fire even after fuel had been shut off by the flight crew.<br />Last weekend’s incident was third in a string of failures involving the same engine and aircraft types in recent years. American regulators had previously ordered stepped-up inspections of fan blades after an earlier engine failure on another United flight on a Boeing 777 in 2018. Then in December, an engine failed during a  Japan Airlines Co.  flight to Tokyo, prompting the FAA’s fresh scrutiny.<br />The FAA said Monday it had been “evaluating whether to adjust blade inspections” following December’s incident, after reviewing maintenance and inspection records and conducting a metallurgical examination of a fan blade fragment to determine the cause of a fracture in the engine failure.</td>

For five years, as her husband was on the run and in prison, Ms. Coronel acted as Mr. Guzmán’s courier, sending instructions to associates that dealt with increasing heroin production, paying bribes, buying weapons, and trying to bust Mr. Guzmán out of prison, according to an arrest affidavit.<br />Ms. Coronel, believed to be Mr. Guzmán’s third or fourth wife, is charged with conspiring to distribute heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana in the U.S., according to the affidavit, signed by a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent. She couldn’t be reached for comment. Court records don’t list an attorney for Ms. Coronel.<br />The arrest of Ms. Coronel could add new friction to U.S.-Mexico relations. It comes months after the October arrest in Los Angeles of Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos, Mexico’s former defense minister, as he and his family arrived on a family vacation. A month later, U.S. officials dropped charges after Mexico complained that it had been kept in the dark about the U.S. investigation and threatened to cut off antidrug cooperation.<br />The former general was then returned to Mexico where he was eventually cleared of charges after Mexican prosecutors said the U.S. case was weak. The U.S. Department of Justice said it stood by its case.</td>

Its stock, trading around $40 in after hours trading Monday, implied a valuation for Lucid of more than $65 billion. That compares with the roughly $75 billion market capitalization of General Motors Co., which posted a pretax profit of $9.7 billion last year while selling approximately 6.8 million vehicles world-wide.<br />The deal shows the extraordinary appetite among stock investors for SPACs, particularly anything relating to electric vehicles. Amid the soaring value of  Tesla Inc.’s  shares in the past year, investors have rushed into startups in the sector, injecting hundreds of millions of dollars into new companies like  Fisker Inc.  and  Lordstown Motors Corp. —startups that announced deals to go public when they had employee counts in the dozens and had yet to create any revenue.</td>

      <td>The Supreme Court on Monday declined to rein in last year’s judicial rewrite of Pennsylvania election law, despite three dissenting votes. What a missed opportunity to prevent future mischief. President Biden won by enough votes in enough states that this case wouldn’t change the outcome. But it could have cut the odds of a meltdown next time.<br />“Changing the rules in the middle of the game is bad enough,” Justice Clarence Thomas writes in his solo dissent. “Such rule changes by officials who may lack authority to do so is even worse.” The Constitution gives state legislatures the power to decide the “manner” of elections, but courts and officials last year ignored black-letter law.<br />Pennsylvania legislators unambiguously said mail ballots were due by 8 p.m. on Nov. 3. Yet the state Supreme Court, gesturing at a vague guarantee of “free and equal” elections, ruled that late-arriving votes would be valid through Nov. 6, even without proof of when they were mailed. In total, 10,097 tardy ballots showed up, 669 lacking legible postmarks. That’s plenty to create havoc in a tighter election.<br />In Minnesota, a Democratic state official settled a lawsuit from a progressive group by agreeing to accept mailed ballots a week past the legal deadline. Five days before Nov. 3, a federal court ordered those ballots—2,460 arrived and were counted, plus 802 rejected for still being late—kept separate, in case they had to be tossed. In other states, deadlines were extended and reverted by different judges.<br />Voters might not know which instructions to follow. Both campaigns might declare victory, which is what happened in a Pennsylvania state Senate race amid a dispute over undated ballots, as Justice Thomas recounts. “The decision to leave election law hidden beneath a shroud of doubt is baffling,” he writes.</td>

      <td>Amazon bans a book as Democrats demand a wider media crackdown.</td>
      <td>Now that voters have turned the authoritarian GOP out of the executive branch and Congress, Americans should expect the open exchange of ideas to flourish again. Right?<br />Consider two events Monday. First, the conservative scholar Ryan Anderson announced that  Amazon  had purged his 2018 book, “When Harry Became Sally,” from its web store. The book criticizes recent progressive ideas about gender and especially the wisdom of sex-change procedures in children.<br />Amazon declined comment on the reasons for the ban, but comment is hardly needed. The tech companies have grown increasingly open about their ideological censorship.<br />Also on Monday, two Congressional Democrats wrote a stern letter to CEO Jeff Bezos about Amazon’s role in politics. If you took seriously the party’s promises to defend “democratic norms,” you might expect Democratic politicians would express concern about the world’s third-largest company by market capitalization trying to suppress a book on a contested political issue.<br />But the letter is a demand for more ideological censorship. “Our country’s public discourse is plagued by misinformation, disinformation, conspiracy theories, and lies,” write Reps. Anna Eshoo and Jerry McNerney. They quote a claim that right-wing media is “much more susceptible,” and demand to know why Amazon’s Fire TV carries certain conservative programs.</td>

      <td>Some states’ tax revenues, finances are better than officials had projected when Covid-19 pandemic first hit</td>
      <td>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is expected to propose making a full payment to the state’s chronically underfunded pension system for the first time since 1996, a sign that the blow from the pandemic to all states’ finances isn’t as brutal as officials originally feared.<br />Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, will call for a $6.4 billion payment to the pension system in his budget address Tuesday, senior members of his administration said. The Murphy administration has been ramping up pension payments and originally intended on making a payment of $5.76 billion for the fiscal year that begins in July.<br />In New Jersey, as in many other states, tax revenues have outperformed earlier projections. When the pandemic hit, states projected revenue would drop off significantly. State revenues ended up falling 1.6% in fiscal year 2020 and were 3.4% lower than projected before the pandemic, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. While states expect revenues to fall 4.4% in fiscal 2021, which ends on June 30 for most, 18 states are seeing revenues come in above forecasts.<br />Federal aid for businesses and households helped prop up incomes and consumer spending across the U.S. Unemployment fell and economic activity picked up much faster than expected.<br />State and local budget shortfalls have been at the center of discussions in Washington since last spring over what to include in another economic relief package.</td>

      <td>The Trump years left the U.S. ceding ground for its exports. Biden can regain it, with the help of allies.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s announcement that America is back—ready to engage in the diplomacy that has been a hallmark of our leadership for generations—was music to the ears of those who believe U.S. leadership is essential to global order. Unfortunately, trade didn’t make the cut when the president outlined diplomatic priorities. This merits rethinking.<br />The U.S. and China are engaged in a strategic competition that will determine the shape of global politics this century. But when it comes to trade, a critical dimension of that competition, America is ceding the field.<br />In recent years, the U.S. has imposed unilateral tariffs and trade barriers on allies and adversaries alike. Controls on the trade of technology, while important for national security, have been unnecessarily broad and often unilateral. The U.S. withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). And it has, through a mixture of negligence and obstruction, hobbled the World Trade Organization. These actions undermined America’s leadership of the global trade system, to the dismay of our allies and partners and to the detriment of our firms and workers.<br />At the same time, China has expanded its trade footprint. Already the world’s largest exporter, China is rapidly displacing the U.S. as the largest trade partner for much of the world. Ninety countries traded twice as much with China as with America in 2018. Last year China surpassed the U.S. as the largest recipient of foreign direct investment.<br />As part of its global campaign, China signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership last year, a trade agreement that includes U.S. allies such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. It signed an investment agreement with the European Union in December and has announced a customs initiative with Eastern European countries. Beijing is planning new trade agreements with countries in the Middle East and Africa, as well as a regional agreement with Japan and South Korea.</td>

      <td>The link between sports fandom and physical and mental health is well documented. But the greatest beneﬁt is an appreciation for fair play.</td>
      <td>The main message of Larry Olmsted’s informative “Fans: How Watching Sports Makes Us Happier, Healthier, and More Understanding” is that sports fandom is good for you. People who support a sports team are on balance less depressed, less lonely, less angry, less tense, more extroverted and more satisfied with their social lives. And this mental buoyancy is by no means the end of it. As Mr. Olmsted explains, fans are also smarter, richer, more educated and physically more active. By the end of the book I was starting to feel sorry for all the poor saps who can’t see the point of sport. How do they live?<br />Mr. Olmsted, a journalist and the author of “Real Food/Fake Food,” has plenty of scientific references to back up his claims. Still, as he is aware, it is not always clear which is the cause and which is the effect. Are the benefits due to the fandom, or the other way around? It isn’t hard to see how rooting for a team might raise your spirits—it enrolls you in a ready-made community and keeps you entertained through the long winter evenings. But in other cases the story is less straightforward.<br />Take the association Mr. Olmsted cites between fandom and higher academic grades. Perhaps watching sports does do something to quicken your wits. But it seems just as likely that a sharp mind is a requirement for signing up in the first place. Football, for instance, can be daunting in its complexity. As someone who did not grow up with the sport, I can testify to the commitment and study needed to appreciate its finer points. It is a wonderful game, but it is not designed to appeal to those with limited powers of analysis and concentration.<br />The same question about direction of causation arises with fandom and physical fitness. Mr. Olmsted describes how the Olympics and other high-profile sporting events lead to increases in the number of people who go running, cycling or skiing. But he doesn’t extend the argument to the main American spectator sports. One can see why. It is a curious quirk of history that the U.S. has ended up with leading sports that are not only intellectually demanding but simply too physically difficult for ordinary mortals to play. Perhaps it is true that football fans have above-average fitness. But that is certainly not due to their fandom’s moving them off their couches and onto the playing field.<br />The rest of the world provides an interesting comparison. Mr. Olmsted’s focus is by no means exclusively American, and he notes more than once that soccer and cricket are the dominant sports world-wide. But he fails to observe that, by contrast with American spectator sports, both soccer and cricket are open to anybody who is able-bodied, and are supported by huge pyramids of amateur leagues, with millions participating well into their middle years. It would have been interesting to know if any comparative data show that this international contrast matters to the connection between fandom and physical fitness.</td>

      <td>What if it had been up to Congress to choose the president Jan. 6?</td>
      <td>After the Jan. 6 riot ended, Congress proceeded with the formality of certifying the presidential election. But imagine how contentious the day might have been if Congress’s role had been more than a formality. If no candidate had achieved an Electoral College majority—because of either a three-party split, faithless electors or a 269-269 tie—Congress would have chosen the president.<br />Absent an electoral majority, the 12th Amendment requires the House (the newly elected one, seated on Jan. 3) to choose the president from among the top three finishers. But representatives don’t vote individually. Instead, each state delegation casts a single vote for president from the top three finishers, and a majority of states are needed—a constitutional anomaly, as it departs from the House’s democratic structure. In the current House, although the Democrats have a slim majority, Republican state delegations outnumber Democratic ones, 27-20 (the Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania delegations are evenly split). The current House would presumably elect a Republican despite its Democratic majority.<br />But if the House had more evenly split delegations—23 states have an even number of seats—it is entirely possible that no candidate could get the required majority of 26 states in the House. Likewise in a three-candidate race. If that came to pass, the vice president-elect—chosen by the Senate from the top two candidates absent an electoral majority—would become acting president on Inauguration Day.<br />This process poses potential conflicts of interest for congressional leaders. In an evenly split Senate, the incumbent vice president would cast the deciding vote. In eight of the past 10 elections, the vice president was on his party’s ticket. And if Congress fails to choose either a president or a vice president, the House speaker would become acting president on Jan. 20.<br />Another problem: What if the House elects a president of one party and the Senate elects a vice president of the other? The vice presidency was once an administrative backwater, but these days the vice president has an office in the West Wing and participates in the most intimate discussions of the administration as it develops policies. A partisan rivalry would likely prompt the president to exclude the vice president. But then the vice president wouldn’t be ready to take over if the president leaves office or is temporarily incapacitated.</td>

      <td>For progressives, Asian-American achievement is an embarrassment.</td>
      <td>The North Thurston Public Schools in Lacey, Wash., made headlines in November when their “equity report” classified Asian-Americans along with whites instead of as “students of color.” Apparently the Asian-Americans were doing too well academically to be students of color. After what the district said was “an overwhelming public response,” it admitted its “category choices” had “racist implications” and dropped the equity report from its website.<br />To normal Americans, it makes no sense. How are Asian-Americans not “people of color”? But give the North Thurston folks credit for following progressive logic to its conclusion. Modern progressive theory more or less divides the nation between the oppressors, defined as whites, and the oppressed, defined as everyone else. In this framework, achieving success puts you on the side of the oppressors and thus makes you white or “white-adjacent”—even if your family came from China or India.<br />Calling it progressive to send children of color the message that achievement is white is an irony lost on the woke. Bigoted laws such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 or actions such as the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II were once thought among the worst stains on American history left by anti-Asian racism. But these days the characterization of Asian-Americans as the “model minority” triggers the woke.<br />“Asian-Americans are caught in a bind—condemn the system of white supremacy and privilege along with other people of color or be ‘banished’ from the victim group as white-adjacent,” says Wenyuan Wu, executive director of Californians for Equal Rights. “The end goal here is to pit people against each other as if our hyphenated identities are bigger than our common destiny as Americans.”<br />The principal reason for this is the fact of Asian-American achievement. This is an embarrassment to progressives because it undermines the claim that structural racism dooms nonwhite citizens to the margins of the American dream. So Asian-American achievement must either be dismissed as somehow white or sacrificed at the altar of equity.</td>

      <td>As climate moves to the center of the world stage, activists will lose influence over policy.</td>
      <td>President Biden laid down a climate marker in his inaugural address: “A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear.” He returned to the theme in his speech last week to the Munich Security Conference, calling the climate crisis “existential.”<br />For environmentalists, those are welcome words. The Trump years saw the U.S. leave the Paris Agreement while pursuing aggressive deregulation at home. Climate change is now back on the national agenda.<br />There are two mistakes observers can make about this new era of climate diplomacy. The first is to think it won’t last or will be limited to rhetoric. Climate skeptics and fossil-fuel interests should brace themselves. The fight to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions and to shift the world’s energy systems toward much lower emissions isn’t going away. Key positions up and down the government bureaucracy will be filled by committed greens who have thought long and hard about how to use the powers of the regulatory state to achieve green goals. A host of new policies—and new regulations—are sure to come.<br />Those who dismiss ideas like the “green new deal” as mere left-wing fantasies miss the enormous appeal of these programs for corporations looking for new business opportunities. It isn’t only renewable energy companies looking for government mandates and funding. It’s major auto manufacturers dreaming of replacing every gasoline-powered car and truck on the planet with an electric vehicle—and reaping the public-relations reward of looking virtuous. It’s construction companies looking to replace the existing energy infrastructure.<br />But if skeptics underestimate the effect the climate movement will have on the world’s economy, greens are in danger of overestimating how much their efforts will help the polar bears. Paradoxically, as climate change assumes a more prominent place on the international agenda, climate activists will lose influence over climate policy.</td>

Mr. Neumann stepped down under pressure as CEO in the wake of the IPO debacle.<br />The negotiations have been rocky at times and there is no guarantee they will produce an agreement, but if there is one, it could be finalized in the coming days, the people said.<br />Should there be a settlement, it could be followed by another deal as WeWork is also in talks to combine with a special-purpose acquisition company, a move that would finally convert it into a public company.</td>

      <td>Seattle Mariners chief executive Kevin Mather resigned Monday after the public revelation of a disastrous appearance before a local Rotary Club, in which he disparaged foreign players for their English skills, potentially alienated top prospects heralded as the franchise’s saviors and insulted the team’s most veteran leader.<br />If that weren’t enough, Mather also incurred the wrath of Major League Baseball and the players’ union by admitting to what the Major League Baseball Players Association views as bad-faith tactics teams use to delay their top prospects’ free agency. That topic is a running hot spot in the tense relationship between the two sides, at a time when they are about to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement.<br />For that reason, the fallout from Mather’s virtual appearance at a Bellevue Breakfast Rotary Club event earlier this month will continue to reverberate long after he disappears from the sport. His remarks to the local Rotarians, which surfaced on YouTube over the weekend, provided a rare glimpse into the inner workings of MLB’s executive class at a perilous moment for the game’s future.<br />The Mariners sought to depict their highest-ranking employee as a lone actor rather than a representative of MLB’s values. “[Mather’s] comments were inappropriate and do not represent our organization’s feelings about our players, staff and fans,” Mariners chairman John Stanton said Monday afternoon. The Mariners have not made the playoffs since 2001, the longest drought in major North American professional sports.<br />As baseball gears up for its most contentious labor battle this year since the strike of 1994, the players’ union seized on Mather’s speech. It described his comments as  “a highly disturbing yet critically important window into how players are genuinely viewed by management “ that “represents an unfiltered look into club thinking.”</td>

A full House vote is expected Friday or Saturday.<br />The bill moving through the House would provide $400-a-week unemployment benefits through Aug. 29, send $1,400 per-person payments to most households, provide billions in funding for schools and vaccine distribution, expand the child tax credit, broaden child-care assistance and bolster tax credits for health insurance. It would also increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over four years, a point of division among Democrats.<br />“We are in a race against time. Aggressive, bold action is needed before our nation is more deeply and permanently scarred by the human and economic costs of inaction,” House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D., Ky.) said Monday before the vote. “We are going to pass this legislation and we are going to turn this pandemic and economic crisis around.”<br />In the past month, new Covid-19 cases have declined as vaccines rolled out to more Americans, and economists have upgraded their outlooks for the year. But officials including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have said the $1.9 trillion package is needed to dig out of the economic slump induced by the pandemic.</td>

A $2.5 billion bond due 2115 recently traded at 109.585 cents on the dollar, down from 113.530 cents Friday.<br />Petrobras shares and bond prices fell after Mr. Bolsonaro on Friday nominated an army general, Joaquim Silva e Luna, to take over from CEO Roberto Castello Branco. Shares pared declines but finished the session down more than 21% in Brazil—the second-worst trading day in data going back to September 1992—after reports that Mr. Branco intends to stay on in the job through the end of his official term on March 20.<br />Recent fuel-price increases have increased tensions between the Petrobras chief executive and Mr. Bolsonaro. Last Thursday, the company said it would raise the price of gasoline by almost 10% and the price of diesel fuel by almost 15%. Mr. Bolsonaro criticized the decisions and promised changes in the following days.<br />The move spooked investors.

      <td>New York’s governor did to the disabled the same thing he did to the elderly.</td>
      <td>At last, Joe Biden, Anthony Fauci and CNN are no longer presenting New York Democrat Andrew Cuomo as the model governor in pandemic response. The question now is how many lives were lost due to his reckless policy of forcing vulnerable populations to accept greater risk of infection—and then hiding the results. Nursing homes were not the only places forced to accept Covid-positive patients.<br />Maria McFadden Maffucci writes at National Review: “Cuomo’s edicts put another vulnerable population in inexcusable peril: New Yorkers with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) living in group homes.” Ms. Maffucci writes:<br />Guess how that worked out for disabled New Yorkers. As is Cuomo custom, the state government withheld crucial information from public disclosure. Therefore scientists and policy makers had to try to make sense of limited data. Ms. Maffucci says that researchers often had to rely on voluntary reporting from advocacy organizations.<br />The available data told another highly disturbing story. Last year a study in Disability and Health Journal titled “COVID-19 outcomes among people with intellectual and developmental disabilities living in residential homes in New York state” reported some dismal statistics:<br />If the Cuomo government ever allows a full accounting, perhaps researchers can estimate the precise impact of the directive to facilities on accepting Covid-positive patients.</td>

      <td>A new study shows an anti-inflammatory drug can help treat certain severe symptoms of Covid-19, and adds a tool for helping the sickest patients</td>
      <td>An anti-inflammatory drug can help reduce the risk of death in people hospitalized with Covid-19, a new clinical trial indicates, reviving hopes—and debate—about a medicine that many physicians had abandoned after earlier clinical-trial failures.<br />A U.K. study of more than 4,000 hospitalized patients showed that people who received the rheumatoid arthritis drug tocilizumab plus steroids had a 20% lower risk of death after 28 days compared with patients who received steroids and standard care only, according to preliminary results posted online this month.<br />The results haven’t been published yet in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, but U.S. scientists are paying attention to them because of the reputation of the University of Oxford researchers who conducted the study. In June, the same Oxford researchers were the first to prove that the cheap and widely available steroid dexamethasone significantly reduced Covid-19 deaths, a finding that led to the drug becoming a standard treatment for most hospitalized patients.<br />Researchers say Oxford’s study may have succeeded where others failed because it included a much larger number of patients, whose average age was about 63, and included only patients with high inflammation measured in lab tests and low blood-oxygen. The data could lead to the drugs becoming more widely used, especially if they are included as suggested or recommended treatments in guidelines crafted by influential organizations such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health or the Infectious Diseases Society of America.<br />“There have been a lot of studies before this one that suggested a possible benefit and others that seemed not quite as compelling,” said Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. “I think what we were waiting for was a really large scale, well-designed study—and I think we may now have that.”</td>

      <td>Safety agency issues new guidance for manufacturers following criticism over the pace of vaccine clearances</td>
      <td>The Food and Drug Administration said Monday it will quickly analyze any vaccine booster shots against Covid-19 variants such as those from South Africa and the U.K., and won’t require further large clinical trials of the new shots’ effectiveness.<br />The agency issued new guidance for vaccine manufacturers as it looks to establish speedier procedures to deal with virus mutations that could worsen the pandemic. Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement the agency is seeking “efficient ways to modify medical products that either are in the pipeline or have been authorized for emergency use to address emerging variants.”<br />The agency also announced new guidelines for makers of diagnostic tests and monoclonal-antibody drugs about how those companies can best adapt their products to address mutations now cropping up in the U.S.<br />Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s center for biological products, which evaluates vaccines, told reporters Monday the analysis of whether vaccines prevent the new strains of Covid-19 will involve a few hundred research subjects over a couple of months. That would be faster than vaccine trials, which so far have involved thousands of research subjects over several months, followed by an FDA analysis.<br />The federal agency has been criticized for taking up to three weeks just to analyze the clinical study of a new vaccine from  Johnson & Johnson .  J&J said its vaccine was 72% effective in the U.S. in preventing moderate to severe Covid-19 infection. This compared with 57% in South Africa, where the mutant strain has been prominently present.</td>

      <td>LONDON—The U.K.’s rapid vaccine rollout contributed to a substantial drop in infections, hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19, according to data that add to a growing body of evidence that the shots provide significant protection against the disease.<br />The new information from the U.K., published Monday, is preliminary and hasn’t been reviewed by other scientists, but provides reasons for optimism that vaccines offer a route out of a pandemic that has claimed at least 2.5 million lives world-wide and sickened tens of millions.<br />The data suggest vaccines are most successful in preventing hospitalizations and deaths, a top concern of health authorities. While vaccines also suppress new infections, the effect isn’t as pronounced.<br />The information appears to vindicate the U.K.’s policy of stretching limited vaccine supplies by delaying a second shot to up to 12 weeks after the first, while also emphasizing the extra protection that comes from a second shot.<br />The data include an analysis of the effect of vaccinations among the elderly, a study looking at infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare workers, and a broad look at vaccinations in Scotland that covered more than five million people.</td>

      <td>Spotify Technology SA  unveiled plans to vastly expand its global presence by launching in 85 more markets across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Caribbean and Latin America.<br />The streaming company aims to collect millions more music and podcast creators in addition to listeners with new programming as well as tools and functionality. Spotify will be available in 36 additional languages in adding markets that represent access to more than one billion people.<br />In a streamed event on Monday, the Stockholm-based company showcased top executives, artists and celebrities—including Billie Eilish, J Balvin, Prince Harry and former President Barack Obama—to outline its plans. The event touted its growth over the past decade and pointed to the opportunity to feed its “flywheel” with new content and new listeners.<br />“Superstars today are way bigger than they’ve ever been before, but also the number of new niches are extraordinary around the world,” Daniel Ek, Spotify’s chief executive, said in an interview after the event.<br />The expansion from 93 to 178 markets represents Spotify’s biggest market expansion since the company launched in Sweden in 2008. It said more than 80% of creators on its platform are heard outside their home markets. The new regions add to major launches in India, Russia and South Korea over the past two years. Spotify said the expansion will accelerate discovery of more music genres, such as reggaeton and K-pop.</td>

      <td>I might have agreed with Prof. Blinder if the problem today was one of inadequate aggregate demand, but that is not the situation.</td>
      <td>Regarding Alan S. Blinder’s “The Risks of Skimping on Covid Relief” (op-ed, Feb. 18): I might have agreed with Prof. Blinder if the problem today was one of inadequate aggregate demand, as it was in the 1930s and after 2008, but that is not the situation. His focus on traditional macroeconomic policy misses that today’s needs are to help the specific sectors impacted by the pandemic and the people suffering the greatest negative impact from it. It isn’t a problem of inadequate aggregate demand nor an issue of widespread, across-the-board unemployment. Look at the increase in savings rates and the all-time highs in the stock market to realize that sending checks based on prior years’ income with no attempt to target the aid to people who actually were hurt by the pandemic wasn’t the proper policy.<br />How can sending checks to a retired couple whose combined  income has remained steady at $150,000 a year in any way address the problems we currently are facing? A household with school-age children and adults who are now working at home and drawing the same (if not higher) salaries they did in 2019 would be much better served by programs aimed at getting schools reopened rather than receiving a stimulus check. There is no benefit to the travel-industry workers who have lost their jobs nor the restaurant workers whose places of employment close. These are the people who need help. Increasing aggregate demand won’t lead to more demand for air travel, rental cars and hotel stays as long as people are afraid to travel, nor will it increase restaurant employment as long as these places are precluded from being fully open due to health-department restrictions.<br />Bill Powar<br />Palo Alto, Calif.<br /></td>

      <td>The transportation sector currently represents more than 28% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.</td>
      <td>Holman Jenkins’s “EVs Are the Lowest Climate Priority” (Business World, Feb. 10) completely misses the mark. The transportation sector currently represents more than 28% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions per data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency—more than any other sector of the U.S. economy. Cars and light-duty trucks make up nearly 60% of those emissions, without any noticeable decrease in recent years. By way of contrast, carbon emissions from the U.S. power sector are at their lowest level in more than 30 years and continue to fall, as nearly 40% of our nation’s electricity comes from carbon-free sources.<br />Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time, and America’s investor-owned electric companies are well-positioned to continue to be part of the climate solution. This includes taking advantage of the great strides made from emissions reductions in the electric sector to help reduce transportation-sector emissions by increasing the number of nonemitting electric vehicles on U.S. roads. In other words, EVs are a top climate priority and an effective and proven lever to reduce emissions.<br />We look forward to leveraging our progress and to working with the Biden administration on policies that help drive electrification and reduce emissions from the transportation sector.<br />Tom Kuhn<br />President</td>
