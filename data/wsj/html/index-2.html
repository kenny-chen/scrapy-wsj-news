      <td>Pause announced on the president’s first day in office; judge says it violated Administrative Procedure Act</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the Biden administration’s 100-day pause on deportations, saying it likely violated the executive branch’s legal obligations for immigration enforcement.<br />U.S. District Judge Drew B. Tipton of the Southern District of Texas granted the request for a two-week temporary restraining order after the Texas attorney general sued the new administration last Friday to ensure deportations would continue to be carried out. Judge Tipton said his order applied on a nationwide basis.<br />The court order was the first legal setback to President Biden’s immigration agenda, which already is coming under attack from Republicans, much as former President Donald Trump’s policies were challenged by Democratic officials.<br />The Biden administration on its first day announced the 100-day deportation moratorium, which was pushed by immigration activists and Mr. Biden’s rival in the Democratic primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.). The Department of Homeland Security began enforcing the pause Friday.<br />Judge Tipton, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in 2020, issued the order after concluding that Texas was likely to prevail on some of its legal claims. The judge said he would soon consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction that would block the new policy for a longer period.</td>

Officials said they expect the additional doses to be delivered over the summer.<br />The purchases will provide enough supply to vaccinate 300 million Americans in a two-dose regimen over the summer.<br />Even with the increase in doses to states starting next week, supplies aren’t yet sufficient for what is needed, a senior administration official said.<br />“It’s going to take a number of months for us to be in a position for us to say to Americans it’s open season to sign up for vaccinations,” the official said.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The White House said Tuesday that President Biden held his first call as president with Russian President Vladimir Putin and raised concerns about issues including the detaining of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the massive SolarWinds hack and reports of Russia offering bounties on U.S. troops.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Mr. Biden reaffirmed America’s “strong support” for Ukraine’s sovereignty and addressed concerns about Russian interference in the 2020 election. The call also focused on plans to extend a U.S.-Russia nuclear arms treaty for five years.<br />Mr. Biden voiced criticism of Mr. Putin throughout his presidential campaign, and the call represented his first opportunity as president to seek to establish a break from the frequently warm rapport between former President Donald Trump and the Russian leader. Mr. Biden, who as vice president held a face-to-face meeting with Mr. Putin in 2011, has warned Moscow that it could face additional sanctions for election interference if it is confirmed by U.S. intelligence officials.<br />During Mr. Trump’s presidency, some Democratic lawmakers accused the administration of pulling its punches against Moscow, as Mr. Trump rejected intelligence findings of Kremlin election interference. But Mr. Trump countered that his administration had levied more sanctions against Russia than previous administrations.<br />In the days before Mr. Biden’s inauguration, the Trump administration sanctioned seven men, including several former Ukrainian officials, for allegedly interfering in U.S. elections as agents of Russia’s government by promoting theories about Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter.</td>

Those flags are blocking lenders’ ability to move forward second loans for the borrowers, after the program reopened this month.<br />“If you’ve got your fraud mitigation hat on, that’s not all bad,” said Tony Wilkinson, chief executive of the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders trade group. “But some of these businesses are hanging on by a thread and some of them needed the money yesterday.” Mr. Wilkinson said some of the flags are related to errors with basic data entry.<br />The SBA says it is working to remove the roadblocks. It is holding a national call Tuesday afternoon to help participating PPP lenders understand how to resolve the flags.</td>

Pittman said that by Jan. 4 the Capitol Police saw that the rally carried “strong potential for violence,” with extremists likely to attend.<br />“We knew that militia groups and white supremacists organizations would be attending,” Ms. Pittman told the House Committee on Appropriations, according to a copy of her testimony. “We also knew that some of these participants were intending to bring firearms and other weapons to the event. We knew that there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target.”<br />Ms. Pittman said on Jan. 4 her predecessor, Steven Sund, requested the Capitol Police Board, which oversees the department, declare a state of emergency and authorize a request for the National Guard to support the department’s officers.<br />The board denied the request, she said, and instead told Mr. Sund to contact the D.C. National Guard, which she said he did. Mr. Sund also coordinated with acting Police Chief Robert Contee at the Metropolitan Police Department, she said.</td>

      <td>President is expected to launch his health-care agenda by reversing two Trump actions, and is likely to seek expansion of health law</td>
      <td>President Biden on Thursday will begin shaping his health-care agenda by lifting certain restrictions on abortion funding and relaunching Affordable Care Act insurance sign-ups, moving swiftly to reassemble components of the health law weakened by the former Trump administration, according to a person familiar with the planning.<br />Mr. Biden will sign executive orders directing the reopening of enrollment on the ACA’s federal exchanges and rescinding a Trump administration policy that blocked federal funds to nongovernmental agencies that provide abortion counseling or referrals, the person said.<br />Mr. Biden will also initiate a review of a Trump administration decision that cut off federal funding for family-planning organizations such as Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the person said. The Trump administration cut off funding to organizations that refer patients for abortions, and Planned Parenthood left the program known as Title X. An action related to Medicaid, a federal-state program for low-income and disabled people, is also expected.<br />While Mr. Biden agreed with some of Mr. Trump’s health-care initiatives, such as ending surprise medical billings and some antitrust actions to curb market concentration in the industry, the actions coming Thursday are aimed at unraveling his predecessor’s stamp on health care. The moves are spurring criticism from conservative and antiabortion groups that have opposed the ACA and lauded restrictions on federal funding for abortion.<br />Mr. Trump had pledged to repeal the ACA and replace it with a better alternative but failed to do either. He supported key parts of a lawsuit from a coalition of Republican-led states to invalidate the ACA, which the Supreme Court is weighing.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Nearly all Senate Republicans voted to endorse the idea that impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump are unconstitutional, a blow to Democrats’ hopes of recruiting significant GOP support for conviction in the trial set to begin in two weeks.<br />In the 55-45 vote Tuesday to table, or kill, a procedural motion declaring the trial unconstitutional, five Republicans voted to table the motion, siding with all Democrats that the trial should proceed. The five were Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.<br />Forty-five Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, voted to support the assertion of Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) that the impeachment trial of a now-private citizen violates the Constitution and therefore is not in order.<br />A conviction at the conclusion of the trial would require 17 Republicans to join all 50 Democrats to reach the two-thirds supermajority required.<br />Mr. Paul wrote earlier this week that the impeachment trial was “a farce and should be dismissed before it is even allowed to begin.” After the vote, Mr. Paul said the roll call showed that there aren’t enough Republican senators willing to convict Mr. Trump.</td>

      <td>German auto giant is trying to overturn a lower-court ruling that could open the car industry to oversight from municipalities</td>
      <td>German auto giant  Volkswagen AG  is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that it says opens up car makers to a flood of emissions regulations from local governments that could clash with existing federal rules.<br />The request to the high court, filed last week and made public Tuesday, is the latest turn in litigation that has dogged Volkswagen since it admitted in 2015 to rigging 11 million diesel vehicles world-wide with software that allowed them to evade government emissions tests. The company has paid more than $30 billion in fines and settlements because of the scandal, including some $23 billion in the U.S.<br />At issue is a June decision by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that ruled two counties have authority alongside the federal Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the updates that car manufacturers make to emissions systems in vehicles after they are sold. Florida’s Hillsborough County and Salt Lake County in Colorado are seeking daily penalties of $5,000 per rigged diesel car for the local pollution they caused, with potential yearly damages of $11.2 billion.<br />Volkswagen argues it shouldn’t have to pay those fines because the court decision misinterprets the federal Clean Air Act, which it says gives sole regulatory authority over manufacturer changes to car emissions to the EPA and California. The company argues that the EPA approved a software update Volkswagen made to the cars before the diesel-emissions scandal broke, and that its move isn’t akin to something a county could regulate, such as a local mechanic tampering with emissions.<br />To date, the company has entered into $23 billion worth of civil and criminal settlements with federal and state regulators and drivers of nearly 600,000 U.S. diesel vehicles. Those agreements didn’t prevent some states and local governments from separately suing Volkswagen, lawsuits the company has won in Alabama, Tennessee and Minnesota.</td>

      <td>New strains of the coronavirus are prompting strict new rules for international travel, further complicating what was already a nearly impossible feat.<br />Global air traffic is severely depressed, in large part due to a maze of ever-changing travel rules around the world. International passenger demand in November was down 88% from year-earlier levels, according to the latest figures from the International Air Transport Association.<br />But as health officials worry that new coronavirus variants may be more contagious, more deadly or less responsive to vaccines, governments are taking measures ranging from outright bans on international flights to universal testing requirements in effort to contain further spread.<br />Jeffrey Ward, a travel adviser who helps people plan luxury trips, said the biggest fear for many travelers residing in the U.S is getting stuck abroad if they test positive for Covid-19, given new U.S. rules requiring passengers to test negative before boarding a flight. He has steered some toward Hawaii for their beach vacations instead of international destinations. The state requires a negative test to enter, but U.S. visitors won’t need a second test to return home.<br />“People are freaking out,” Mr. Ward said.</td>

      <td>President Biden’s record-setting first day of executive orders contributed to a foreboding sense that red-blue unity was possible only if conservatives moved far left.</td>
      <td>Your editorial “Biden’s Unity Address” (Jan. 21) gives President Biden the benefit of the doubt regarding his desire to bring red- and blue-state Americans together. Did anyone expect a call for disunity? As to whether skepticism is appropriate, recall that six months ago he declared unity with Sen. Bernie Sanders and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Mr. Biden’s supporters issued a 110-page set of mutually agreeable policy plans—or as National Public Radio called it last July, “a blueprint for a progressive presidency.” Sen. Sanders gushed that, “On issue after issue, whether it was education, the economy, health care, climate, immigration, criminal justice, I think there was significant movement on the part of the Biden campaign.” Some of us on the right suspect that policy plans halfway between Sen. Sanders and President Biden have zero unifying appeal to red-staters.<br />President Biden’s record-setting first day of executive orders contributed to a foreboding sense that red-blue unity was possible only if conservatives moved far left. For example, “noncitizens” in the U.S. (primarily people who crossed the U.S. border illegally) will be included in the census count used to apportion congressional representatives. The more noncitizens hosted by a state, the more power that state has in Congress and the more federal funds it is likely to receive. Priorities of the Biden-Sanders unity plan include massive investment in green infrastructure, a new public-health insurance option, Medicare-for-60 (instead of 65), installation of a half-billion solar panels and unionization of jobs in the clean-energy economy. If red-blue unity is centered on Biden-Sanders unity, no thanks. NPR concluded last July that a Biden presidency will arrive “with bold progressive ambitions.” Wrapping bold progressivism in red-blue unity garb is unappealing to about half the country.<br />Dana Davis<br />St. Augustine, Fla.<br /></td>

      <td>A flood of individual investors into the stock market has led to temporary outages at some brokerages</td>
      <td>Stock trading volume has surged in the past week, and Wall Street’s online brokers are struggling to keep up.<br />In recent days, clients of Fidelity Investments, E*Trade Financial Corp., Charles Schwab Corp. and Vanguard Group have encountered brief delays executing trades or temporarily lost access to vital account information. The service disruptions came during a period of frenetic trading, largely driven by individual investors.<br />“These outages generate annoyance among investors in the short term,” said William Trout, director of wealth management at Javelin Strategy & Research. “Longer-term, outages call into question the stability of these platforms, even if the need for greater capacity can be addressed.”<br />The outages also can take their toll on the markets themselves, especially at a time when individual investors’ interest in stocks has touched levels unseen in decades, he said. Robinhood Markets Inc. and other popular trading platforms experienced outages last spring, when concerns over the pandemic and its effect on the economy triggered the worst stock-market selloff since Black Monday.<br />The market snapped back almost as quickly, drawing in many first-time stock traders. And with many Americans transitioning to remote work, those investors had more time to pore over their brokerage accounts and place their bets. Their enthusiasm, along with efforts by brokers to beef up their platforms, so far has offset clients’ frustration with temporary outages. But repeated problems will test their patience and draw regulators’ attention, Mr. Trout said.</td>

      <td>Lawmakers turn toward process called budget reconciliation that requires simple majority vote</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats are weighing aggressive use of existing procedural steps to enact President Biden’s coronavirus relief plan as Republican opposition to the $1.9 trillion proposal hardens.<br />Republicans have balked at much of Mr. Biden’s plan, meaning Democrats are likely to eventually move to a process called budget reconciliation to pass at least part of the legislation with a simple majority in the Senate. Reconciliation typically limits a bill to tax and spending measures, which means that stimulus checks, the child tax credit and unemployment insurance in Mr. Biden’s proposal would almost surely fit within its restrictions.<br />But some in the party want to go further, exploring ways to stretch the rules and precedents that have historically constrained what policy provisions are allowed under the reconciliation process. Some see it as a way to pass party priorities like raising the minimum wage without ending the filibuster, the Senate rule that in practice means most legislation requires 60 votes to advance.<br />“Time is of the essence to address this crisis. We’re keeping all options open on the table, including using budget reconciliation,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Tuesday. Mr. Schumer said the Senate could begin the reconciliation process for Mr. Biden’s relief plan as soon as next week.<br />For now, the Biden administration is urging a bipartisan approach on the coronavirus relief bill, the sixth relief round Congress has taken up since the pandemic began. In a call with top White House officials Sunday, members of both parties said they favored a bipartisan agreement. Lawmakers discussed a narrower bill focused on money for vaccines as a possible area of agreement that could leave other items for a subsequent reconciliation bill.</td>

      <td>On Syfy, Alan Tudyk plays an alien set on destroying the Earth, but first he must disguise himself as a physician, learn to speak English and drink whiskey.</td>
      <td>As immigration stories go, “Resident Alien” isn’t exactly an argument for open borders. Harry Vanderspeigle has, after all, arrived in snowy Patience, Colo., with the express purpose of wiping out all of humankind. His orders from home instruct him to instigate a “full extinction event.” He’s not really interested in assimilation.<br />On the other hand, he’s not actually Harry Vanderspeigle: The real Dr. Harry (Alan Tudyk), an only occasional visitor to Patience, becomes an early casualty of intergalactic hostilities when he’s pitched out the window of his vacation cabin and into the lake by an his alien attacker who assumes the ice will keep the late doctor fresh, and hidden, at least until spring. That accomplished, our alien, who has crash-landed and lost his “device” (the bomb that will obliterate Earth), assumes Harry’s shape, learns human language from watching Jerry Orbach on “Law & Order,” and before anything else can happen is enlisted into public service in a town offbeat enough to assume its strange new physician-psychiatrist is simply, as they say, out there.<br />Based on the Dark Horse comics series co-created by Peter Hogan and Steve Parkhouse, “Resident Alien” carries echoes of many entertainments past, notably the old Peter Sellers movie “Being There,” in which the utterances of an idiot were presumed to be profound, and the erstwhile CBS TV series “Northern Exposure,” whose fish-out-of-water story also took place in a remote locale that needed a doctor and was eccentric enough to accept more eccentricity. Harry (Mr. Tudyk, naturally) is not just an oddball: Missions are subject to change, but his initial intent is to keep his identity secret, kill the one little boy (Judah Prehn) who can see the homicidal alien below Harry’s human disguise, find his device, blow up Earth, and do it all before the real Dr. Harry bobs to the surface.<br />The snag: The town’s regular resident doctor has suddenly turned up mysteriously dead. Harry, who in this case is not the killer, is dragooned by the belligerent Sheriff Mike Thompson (Corey Reynolds) into performing the autopsy. Which gets him far more involved in local events—and the local people—than is wise for a genocidal extraterrestrial.<br />Among all the secret weapons inhabiting “Resident Alien” the principal one is Mr. Tudyk, who often provides voices for animated series (“American Dad!” “Robot Chicken,” “Rick and Morty”) but can assume the otherworldly look, and charms, of a creature cut loose from his reality. I have an indelible memory of him in the original “Death at a Funeral,” as the fiancé who is inadvertently given a hallucinogenic and ends up naked on a roof. He is required, similarly, in “Resident Alien” to play much of Harry’s character straight-faced, though Mr. Tudyk’s face is never quite straight and he occasionally gets to be hilarious, such as when the infinitely patient-in-Patience nurse Asta Twelvetrees (Sara Tomko) and the bartender D’arcy (Alice Wetterlund) introduce him to alcohol. “I’ll say one thing about whiskey,” he tells himself a little later. “It’s allowing me to make smart, rational decisions,” at which point he breaks into the kid’s house and tries to kill him. “There’s an alien under my bed,” young Max tells his mom and dad (Meredith Garretson, Levi Fiehler), who smile indulgently, pooh-pooh the very idea and take him to sleep with them. Close calls are a regular part of life in Harry’s small-town America.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden on Tuesday signed a series of executive orders that are intended to advance racial equity, including action to phase out the federal use of private prisons.<br />“The simple truth is, our soul will be troubled as long as systemic racism is allowed to persist,” Mr. Biden said in remarks at the White House. “It’s corrosive, it’s destructive and it’s costly.”<br />“We’re also less prosperous. We’re less successful. We’re less secure,” he added. “We must change.”<br />Mr. Biden signed a mandate directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development to examine housing policies that disproportionately affect people of color. And he took action to end the Justice Department’s use of private prisons in a return to an Obama-era policy.<br />Then-President Barack Obama’s Justice Department in 2016 said private prisons had more safety and security problems than those run by the U.S. government and moved to phase them out. Former President Donald Trump’s administration reversed that policy, saying the Federal Bureau of Prisons needed to be able to contract with private companies to meet its future needs.</td>

      <td>Naomi Watts stars as a recently-disabled mother whose family takes in an injured magpie.</td>
      <td>Given the intoxicating vistas of “Penguin Bloom,” the romping children on endless Australian beaches, the couple in love and the wistful kid’s voice saying “Everything was pretty much perfect,” you can rest assured that everything’s going south in a matter of moments. And when a movie is “based on a true story,” you can also depend on certain elements being elastic, while the more implausible ones are absolutely true.<br />The unlikeliest aspect of “Penguin Bloom” is the title character, a magpie who will come to be known as Penguin after falling out of a nest and seizing the attentions of the three Bloom boys, Reuben, Oli and Noah (Felix Cameron, Abe Clifford-Barr, Griffin Murray-Johnston). This occurs despite—or more likely because—their mother, Sam (Naomi Watts), has broken her back: During a family vacation in Thailand, she leans on a rotten railing, plummets from a terrace and fractures what she describes as her “bra strap” vertebrae. This transforms her from a surfer mom who keeps an idyllic home in New South Wales into an invalid who, when not assisted by her devoted husband, Cameron (Andrew Lincoln), has to drag herself out of bed and into her wheelchair. She’s wondering why she gets up at all. Her boys are just confused, especially Noah, who blames himself for his mom’s mishap.<br />Based on a book by Cameron Bloom and Bradley Trevor Greive, “Penguin Bloom” isn’t particularly preoccupied with how the bird saves the family; the family really saves itself. But the film is visually lush, not only in the panoramic use of Sydney’s Northern Beaches but of the interiors of the Bloom household, which is ramshackle in a we-live-on-the-beach-but-have-help sort of way. The family keeps bees, which isn’t a plot point, but it explains the kitchen being so full of honey that it burnishes the light; when Sam, in a pique, knocks a jar off the counter to give her impossible mother, Jan (Jacki Weaver), something to do, the result is a syrupy mix of glass, light and the suggestion that beauty can be found in small, unlikely things, even if we viewers are the only ones seeing it at that particular time.<br />That said, “Penguin Bloom” director Glendyn Ivin doesn’t honey-coat the difficulties faced by Sam or her family, which is one of his film’s virtues. The physical trials of Sam are treated quite frankly. It’s probably true, and perhaps ironic, that an actress has to be quite physically fit to convincingly play someone with Sam’s sort of disability. Ms. Watts gives a memorable performance. So does the bird, for different reasons: The Blooms have certainly led a casual kind of existence, but the idea of a wild bird free-ranging it all over one’s home kept me distracted because one, it should have been messier, and two, when avian hygiene is in fact addressed, the kids never properly clean up after it.<br />But of course Penguin is meant as a distraction, for the Blooms and for us, as we all navigate the emotional journey of Sam, making her way to acceptance and finding new ways to live. “Penguin Bloom” is alternately despairing and inspiring—more of the former than the latter, I found, simply because of the production’s honesty, and the lifetime of difficulty the Blooms’ story suggests. “I consider myself the luckiest man alive,” Cameron says to Sam during one of her bluer moments, to which she responds “Oh, shut up,” which rings right and appropriate and certainly seems based on a true story.</td>

      <td>Congressional Democrats propose phasing in higher pay floor over five years</td>
      <td>President Biden wants to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, and Democratic allies in Congress released new details Tuesday on legislation to lift the wage floor in phases over five years. The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 an hour since 2009, with a patchwork of states increasing the wage floor above that minimum.<br />Here is what we know about the status of the $15 minimum-wage proposal:<br />Mr. Biden in two recent speeches called for a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, which requires action by Congress. A bill introduced by Democrats this week would increase the wage floor to $15 an hour in phases over five years, starting at $9.50 an hour the day a new law becomes effective. Annual increases would follow until reaching $15 an hour, then the rate would be reviewed annually and adjusted based on changes to median hourly earnings of all employees.<br />Democrats also proposed gradual elimination of subminimum wages for workers who are in part paid through tips. That minimum wage for adult workers is currently $2.13 an hour. The bill also eliminates separate subminimum wages for youth and disabled workers.<br />Democrats say raising the minimum wage will help lift the lowest-wage workers out of poverty and give them more spending power. The proposal matches a level long backed by labor unions.</td>

      <td>Adapting to life at sea wasn’t easy for L.A. comic Mike Siegel, then Covid sunk the cruise industry</td>
      <td>IN THE SUMMER of 2015, I performed stand-up comedy on a TV talent competition. The morning after it aired, the phone rang. The man on the other end was a Florida-based talent agent with a proposition: “Ever think about doing cruises?”<br />The truth was that I hadn’t thought about cruises much. I’d taken exactly one cruise in my life 30 years ago with some college friends on a weeklong booze-fueled lap around the Caribbean. Though I’m hazy on details, I do remember finding the cruise experience confining, overly structured and, I’ll say it, boring. Toss in my penchant for motion sickness, and I never returned to the open seas.<br />But work is work and the money being offered was decent. I took the gig, knowing it came with strings attached. Most cruise ships want clean, family-friendly acts: no swearing, politics, religion, or overtly sexual material. Such rules are the reason many comics won’t (or can’t) do cruises.<br />I’m considered a clean act in comedy clubs, but I still got reprimanded on my first cruise for material that would barely raise an eyebrow from “The Tonight Show” censors. It’s not uncommon to walk on a ship’s stage to see three generations of the same family in the front row, complete with dozing grandparents and restless toddlers. It’s the only time I envy clowns.<br />My seasickness was also a real concern at first, but I’m proud to say I never “fed the fish” in my four years of cruising. The massive size of most modern cruise ships helps considerably in reducing the motion of the ocean, but the smaller the ship, the rougher it can get.</td>

The sprawling investigation includes FBI agents who normally handle a range of other matters, including securities fraud, public corruption, drugs, and gangs, the filings show.<br />FBI field offices from Arizona to New York have fanned out to make arrests, search homes and interview witnesses, family members and associates. Homeland security agents and local law enforcement have also taken part in the investigation, according to the filings and people involved.<br />Current and former law-enforcement officials said the effort was comparable with some of the largest investigations in the FBI’s recent history, such as the Oklahoma City bombing and the Boston Marathon attack. The result has been a rapid-fire series of criminal complaints, arrest and search warrants, and grand jury indictments, with more arrests expected. The effort is aimed at deterring future efforts to besiege the capital and to root out dangerous groups, the officials said.<br />“The scope and scale of this investigation and these cases are really unprecedented not only in FBI history, but probably DOJ history,” said Michael Sherwin, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, which is overseeing the prosecutions. Speaking at a recent news conference, Mr. Sherwin said there were thousands of potential witnesses and likely hundreds of criminal cases.</td>

In recent years, the rule has gained traction in corporate America, particularly for boards of directors.<br />The commitments came about after the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, a union group, sent proposals to the banks in its capacity as a shareholder. The group owns shares through its reserve fund. That led to discussions and a series of agreements, according to Brandon Rees, deputy director of corporations and capital markets at AFL-CIO.<br />Banks say they already had interview policies to diversify their ranks, but the public agreements are meant to add an element of accountability for their progress. Over the summer, racial justice protests drew attention to structural barriers for people to color to advance in corporate America. At banks, where women and minorities have long struggled to ascend to the top ranks, attention turned to hiring practices.</td>

      <td>Johnson & Johnson  stock hasn’t yet caught the eyes of Reddit day traders. But the business outlook for the health-care giant is as bright as ever.<br />The company said Tuesday that it expects to book between $88.8 billion and $90 billion in 2021 sales, after adjusting for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign-exchange effects. That is good for a growth rate of about 8% from last year. Johnson & Johnson also expects adjusted earnings of about $9.50 a share, which would be nearly 20% growth. Shares rallied in morning trading.<br />A gradual return to normal in the medical-devices business segment is a big part of that formula: The onset of Covid-19 and resulting disruptions to elective surgical procedures led to a 10.5% sales decline in 2020 from a year earlier. That improved to just a 1.5% decline in the fourth quarter, however. There should be further upside ahead, as sales in some device categories like vision and orthopedics have been slower to recover. Finance Chief Joseph Wolk said in an interview that short-term weakness didn’t affect any long-term business opportunity, as research-and-development spending actually grew by $800 million in 2020 from a year ago.<br />Shares are trading at about 18 times this year’s adjusted profit forecast, a fairly sober valuation in a wild market.<br />The company’s guidance leaves other sources of potential upside. It certainly has the firepower to make a large pharmaceutical or medical-device acquisition should it choose to do so: Johnson & Johnson ended the year with $10 billion in net debt on its books, or half the free cash flow generated in 2020.</td>

In the first three episodes, the couple has gone from being perceived by neighbors and colleagues as suspiciously childless during the black-and-white, Dick Van Dyke era, to becoming parents of twins living a colorful life reminiscent of “The Brady Bunch.”<br />Ms. Schaeffer—whose screenwriting credits include “The Hustle,” a gender-reversed remake of “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels”—wasn’t obsessed by comics and superheroes as a girl. But when doors in Hollywood started opening wider for women, she found a place at Marvel.<br />“I came to learn pretty quickly that the sprawling mythology of [the Marvel Cinematic Universe] is the ultimate playground for storytelling,” she says.</td>

      <td>Consumer confidence in the U.S. rose in January as expectations for the economy and the labor market improved, according to data from the Conference Board released Tuesday.<br />The group’s consumer confidence index rose to 89.3 in January from 87.1 in December.<br />January marks the first uptick in consumer confidence after two consecutive months of declines for the index. However, it remains below the October level of 101.4, which was the highest since the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S., and February’s pre-pandemic level of 132.6.<br />The January increase was driven by consumers’ more upbeat outlook for the economy and jobs, suggesting they foresee conditions improving in the not-too-distant future, said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board.<br />“In addition, the percent of consumers who said they intend to purchase a home in the next six months improved, suggesting that the pace of home sales should remain robust in early 2021,” Ms. Franco said.</td>

      <td>More sensors, missiles and other assets in the region will help deter China from a costly island invasion.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration faces a stark reality: Over the next four years it’s possible that China will try to take Taiwan. For the first time since 1950, Beijing may reasonably think it has a viable military option to force what it regards as a renegade province to heel. President Xi Jinping has said Taiwan must be part of China—and has signaled he intends to do something about it.<br />The stakes for America are immense. Keeping Taiwan out of Beijing’s grip is crucial for denying China’s goal of attaining regional hegemony and eventually global pre-eminence. The island occupies a pivotal geographic position. If Taiwan falls, China would have the ability to project military power throughout Asia. Japan, the Philippines, Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands would all be more vulnerable to China’s military.<br />The U.S. has long opposed China’s belligerence toward Taiwan, and states in the region would read the U.S. response to an attack as a bellwether of American reliability. Forgoing Taiwan’s defense would seriously undermine America’s credibility among already nervous Asian allies and partners. For these reasons, the recently declassified 2018 Indo-Pacific strategy specifically ordered the Pentagon to implement a defense strategy that will make the U.S. capable of defending Taiwan.<br />But can America even defend Taiwan from a China that has become so powerful? The People’s Liberation Army is growing stronger at an astonishingly fast rate. The PLA Navy already has more ships than the U.S. Navy, its air forces are the largest in the region, and Beijing also boasts the world’s largest missile force. Beijing seeks to reach technical parity with America’s armed forces by the 2020s, and surpass us by 2030.<br />Despite all this, the answer is yes. Defeating a PLA attack would be far from easy or cheap, and being ready to do so will involve wrenching changes in the U.S. and Taiwanese defense establishments. But it is doable.</td>

Now, it is one of his trickiest management challenges.<br />Over the past 18 months, Google’s parent has waded through one controversy after another involving its top researchers and executives in the field.<br />In the most high-profile incident, last month Google parted ways with a prominent AI researcher, Timnit Gebru, after she turned in studies critical of the company’s approach to AI and complained to colleagues about its diversity efforts. Her research findings concluded that Google wasn’t careful enough in deploying such powerful technology and was callous about the environmental impact of building supercomputers.<br />Mr. Pichai pledged an investigation into the circumstances around her departure and said he would seek to restore trust. Ms. Gebru’s boss, Jeff Dean, told employees that he determined her research was insufficiently rigorous.<br />Nearly 2,700 Google employees have since signed a public letter that says Ms. Gebru’s departure “heralds danger for people working for ethical and just AI—especially Black people and People of Color—across Google.”</td>

      <td>People who didn’t get the full relief payments can get the remainder on their 2020 tax returns—if they qualify</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Internal Revenue Service is basically done sending out stimulus checks, after finishing a first round in the spring and summer and a second round in December and January. But there are still billions of dollars that some households can claim—through their 2020 tax returns.<br />Here are some key questions and answers:<br />No. The first round was $1,200 per adult and $500 per child and the second was $600 per adult and $600 per child. Anyone who received all of that money doesn’t need to do anything. And the stimulus payments aren’t taxable income.<br />There are several categories of people who might not have received their full stimulus payments. Because the payments were based on 2018 or 2019 income and household size, some people may be eligible based on their 2020 status—even if they weren’t eligible for an upfront payment.<br />That can happen if income changed. The payments start phasing out when income reaches $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples. So a single person who earned $125,000 in 2018 and 2019 and $70,000 in 2020 would have received no payments but would be able to claim both stimulus payments on the 2020 tax return for a total of $1,800.</td>

Mr. Orcel is suing the bank for €100 million, equivalent of $121 million.<br />Mr. Orcel had been keen on getting the UniCredit job, flying frequently to Italy from London over the past weeks to lobby for the position, according to people familiar with the situation.<br />Mr. Orcel couldn’t be reached for comment.

      <td>Ralph Hamers’s plans for the bank are overshadowed by a Dutch investigation into a money-laundering scandal at his prior employer</td>
      <td>UBS  is in less need of strong management than most of its European peers—which is fortunate given the awkward position of its new boss.<br />On Tuesday, the Switzerland-based bank announced excellent full-year results, with profits up across the group. Chief executive Ralph Hamers, who took the reins in November, also gave hints of a new strategy he hopes to announce next quarter.<br />His plans were unfortunately overshadowed by December’s surprise decision by the Netherlands to open a new inquiry into Mr. Hamers’ role in a money-laundering scandal at his former employer, ING. The matter was previously thought to have been settled before his hiring. The investigations, which typically take about 18 months, are an unwelcome source of uncertainty for UBS’s investors.<br />The bank’s strategy involves integrating wealth management, investment banking and asset management to serve high-net-worth individuals globally, with a special focus on growth in Asia. Any leader is likely to build on that successful formula rather than reinvent it. Mr. Hamers highlighted three focus areas: improving technology investment, re-evaluating subscale markets and forging a more unified, agile corporate culture.<br />The technology focus isn’t a surprise. Mr. Hamers was hired for his expertise in digital transformation, and all banks are investing in technology to cut costs and improve products. He won’t spend more money, but rather shift to shorter-term projects and quarterly, instead of annual funding decisions.</td>

      <td>Tired of being cooped up in an apartment and eager for a fresh start to the new year, Karen Fine, a schoolteacher in Chicago, is planning a family vacation…to Chicago.<br />Next month, Ms. Fine, husband Eric Fine and their children Asher, 8, Molly, 7, and Lucy, 4, will pack up the car and drive 2 miles away to a hotel downtown, where they spent Christmas Eve in December. Plans include swimming in the hotel pool and drinking hot chocolate while watching movies in their room. On Saturday they’ll do some window shopping on Michigan Avenue followed by an afternoon outing to a bowling alley.<br />“It will break up the monotony of waking up every day and it’s Groundhog Day,” says Ms. Fine, a 40-year-old Spanish teacher who spends most of her workday alone in front of a computer, leading virtual classes to mostly ninth- and 10th-graders. By going to a hotel, says Asher, the couple’s third-grader, “you get a break from your house.”<br />Right now, the pandemic--along with social and political unrest—have Americans going a little stir crazy. And January can be hard even in normal times. “There is a subconscious kind of depression we get coming off the high from the holidays,” says John Dick, chief executive of CivicScience, a Pittsburgh consumer-research firm. The company surveyed nearly 3,000 adults between Jan. 8 and Jan. 11, with 27% of the respondents saying they felt the “post-holiday blues” more than last year.<br />Some families have taken matters into their own hands, making plans for wintertime events and getaways to bring back the joy. On the list are celebratory gatherings with friends, neighbors and co-workers, as well as “some day” vacations for when it’s safer to travel. Even hotels are retooling their offerings, giving fidgety families special programs at weekday rates. Just having something on the calendar to look forward to can perk up spirits.</td>

      <td></td>
      <td>Malcolm Butler is the president and CEO of the Fiduciary Group in Savannah, Ga.<br />While awaiting the recent birth of my first granddaughter, I spent a lot of time thinking about the best possible gift I could give her. Ultimately, I decided that the ideal present for my grandchild was to give her parents–my daughter and her husband–a professionally drafted estate plan.<br />New parents can be overwhelmed with the incredible responsibilities associated with caring for a newborn, so they aren’t always thinking about the importance of drafting wills and other estate-planning documents. According to a 2020 Caring.com survey, only 16.4% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 and 27.2% of Americans between the ages of 35 and 54 have estate-planning documents. Dying without a will can lead to serious financial problems and burden surviving family members with avoidable stress. For example, if new parents don’t appoint a guardian in a legally binding will, a judge could ultimately decide who will raise their children in the event that the parents pass away before the children reach the age of majority.<br />In addition, given the financial demands associated with raising a child, new parents can be short on cash and tend to postpone spending money on expenses not seen as necessary and immediate. Investment-savvy grandparents should consider gifting an estate plan in order to make sure that their grandchildren are adequately protected in the event of the premature death of their parents.<br />High net-worth investors already understand the importance of strategy, planning and adhering to a long-term perspective. Those same principles apply when it comes to gifting an estate plan because you are, in essence, taking steps to prepare for various future contingencies and to ensure that your grandchild will be protected, both financially and personally, in the event of an unforeseen emergency affecting your adult child and his or her spouse.</td>

He urged companies to make clear how they were preparing for a global regime focused on “net zero” goals to emit no more carbon dioxide than it removes from the atmosphere by 2050, a priority in line with the Paris climate accord.<br />One of President Biden’s first acts in office was getting the U.S. to rejoin the climate accord, signaling the administration’s heightened focus on companies’ carbon footprint. Some regulators said that climate risks’s effects on the financial system need to be better understood.<br />“Better sustainability disclosures are in companies’ as well as investors’ own interests,”  Mr. Fink said in a letter released to chief executives of companies Tuesday. “I urge companies to move quickly to issue them rather than waiting for regulators to impose them.”<br />The company told clients it would flag companies that posed significant climate risk for potential selling from its actively-managed portfolios. It also planned to publish the proportion of its assets “aligned to net zero” and goals on that metric going forward.</td>

      <td>With spring training three weeks away, MLB owners want to delay opening day, while the players union prepares for a full season</td>
      <td>With coronavirus infections dipping nationwide, one might think Major League Baseball’s owners would feel a bit more optimistic about spring training starting in a few weeks. Instead, they want to delay or even shorten the upcoming season, hoping that widespread vaccine distribution would create safer conditions for players and allow fans to buy tickets to attend again.<br />The Players Association, however, argues that MLB has no legal grounds to deviate from the 2021 schedule that has been set since July without its consent and expects to push ahead with a full slate. The union has indicated that it has no intention of accepting a deal that results in players receiving anything less than 100% pay, after they received 37% of their salaries during last year’s 60-game campaign in empty stadiums.<br />The brewing conflict raises the prospect of Round 2 of a bitter pandemic dispute from last spring, which threatened to derail the entire season and further damaged the industry’s contentious labor relations. This time, the stakes are even higher: The current collective bargaining agreement expires on Dec. 1, with the reality of a work stoppage in 2022 becoming increasingly realistic as trust between the two sides deteriorates beyond its already-fractured state.<br />Internally, MLB recognizes that it has little recourse to unilaterally impose a schedule of fewer than 162 games. That’s why commissioner Rob Manfred has instructed teams to plan for camps across Arizona and Florida to open on time.<br />In a statement, MLB said it would “continue to consult with public health authorities, medical experts, and the Players Association” about whether any schedule modifications should be made. The MLBPA said, “While we, of course, share the goals of a safe spring training and regular season, MLB has repeatedly assured us that it has instructed its teams to be prepared for an on-time start.”</td>

Enrollment through the Actors’ Equity Association, which covers actors and stage managers, has already dropped by nearly a quarter, with 5,509 members covered at the start of this year compared with more than 7,200 at the end of 2019.<br />Officials estimate enrollment will continue dropping by about 10% monthly, with just over 4,000 members covered at the end of March, according to a spokesman for the Equity-League Benefit Funds, a separate organization that governs the union members’ benefit programs. Members need to work a minimum number of weeks to qualify for six months to a year of coverage, and in normal times performers often take on extra jobs to make sure they hit the threshold.<br />The fund receives 88% of its funding from employer contributions and officials project its reserve levels will decline to $30 million by the middle of the year if live performances don’t return to near-normal levels, compared with $120 million before the pandemic hit. As a result, trustees voted to increase premiums and raise the eligibility threshold for coverage.<br />“We understand that, without the ability to work, many participants may not qualify for coverage under any realistic benefit plan we could devise and financially sustain,” the funds’ trustees said in a statement. “Sadly, there is nothing the Health Fund can do to affect the course of the pandemic or to accelerate the safe reopening of live theater.”</td>

Net income is expected to jump by $1 billion to $12.6 billion, according to FactSet.<br />The remote work era has been a boon for Microsoft. In addition to its videogaming and cloud-computing products, the company has seen strong sales for its Surface laptops as people bought devices to work remotely and enable distance learning. And use of Microsoft’s Teams workplace collaboration software that includes text chat and videoconferencing, and has been a priority for Chief Executive Satya Nadella, has jumped during the pandemic. Microsoft shares have risen more than 37% over the past year.<br />Mr. Nadella’s bet on cloud computing has been pivotal to Microsoft’s multiyear run of year-over-year sales increases. Sales for the company’s Azure cloud-services have expanded rapidly however, before the pandemic hit, the pace of growth was slowing as the business gained scale. The remote work era arrested that decline. Azure sales increased 48% in the September quarter, up from 47% expansion in the prior three-month period.<br />Azure became a bigger source of revenue for Microsoft than its Windows operating system licenses in the September quarter, said Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Piper Sandler. Microsoft doesn’t break out Azure revenue, but the company is the world’s second-largest cloud-computing vendor after  Amazon.com Inc.</td>

      <td>KAMPALA, Uganda—Ugandan rapper-turned-opposition leader Bobi Wine pledged to continue his fight to oust longtime President Yoweri Museveni, after soldiers released him from nearly two weeks of home detention following January’s disputed election.<br />Dozens of chanting supporters, waving the brightly colored flags of Mr. Wine’s National Unity Platform party, thronged his residence outside Kampala, a day after a court ruled that his detention was unlawful. Mr. Wine, whose bid to unseat Mr. Museveni after nearly 35 years in power struck a chord with many young voters, called on them to peacefully march against the outcome of the Jan. 14 vote.<br />“Museveni is using the military and the police in a partisan manner to oppress his opponents and to suppress our rights,” said Mr. Wine. “We are standing for what is moral and what is just.”<br />Soldiers confined Mr. Wine and his wife at their home a day after the election, which took place amid a total internet blackout and heavy security. According to the official results, which Mr. Wine says were rigged, he won 35% of the vote, compared with 59% for Mr. Museveni. Mr. Wine’s party has until Feb. 5 to challenge the outcome in court.<br />U.S. officials have said the results were fundamentally flawed and, along with other governments, urged an investigation into the deadly violence that preceded the vote. On polling day, police arrested 30 election observers, hours after the U.S. called off its own monitoring mission when many of its observers were denied accreditation.</td>

But modest growth in consumer-health products also contributed to the sales boost in the latest quarter.<br />Alex Gorsky, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said that Johnson & Johnson would soon share data from its final-stage study of the coronavirus vaccine it is developing. Emergency approval from the Food & Drug Administration could follow, and would bolster the U.S. supply of shots aimed at ending the pandemic amid a rocky vaccine rollout.<br />If study results, expected by early next week, are positive and the vaccine receives U.S. authorization, J&J expects to provide about 100 million doses for use in the U.S. by the end of June, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said in an interview. The federal government also has options to purchase additional doses beyond that.<br />J&J tested its vaccine as a single dose. The vaccine can be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures, whereas the two vaccines authorized in the U.S. are given in two doses and must be kept at frozen temperatures, before being thawed for administration.</td>

      <td>Outlook has been buoyed by hopes for increasing vaccination and improved therapies to combat Covid-19</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The world economy is gearing up for a strong recovery from the pandemic in 2021 after shrinking considerably less than initially feared last year, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, though it warned that the outlook is subject to exceptional uncertainty.<br />Global output is projected to grow 5.5% this year, up from the IMF’s October forecast of a 5.2% increase. Last year’s estimated contraction of 3.5% was smaller than October’s forecast for a 4.4% contraction. China was the only major economy to grow last year, expanding by 2.3% amid effective containment measures and forceful economic support, the IMF said.<br />The outlook has been buoyed by hopes for increasing vaccination and improved therapies to combat Covid-19, which sparked widespread economic lockdowns last year. It assumes “broad vaccine availability in advanced economies and some emerging market economies in summer 2021 and across most countries by the second half of 2022,” the IMF said. That is faster than the multilateral lender expected when it published its previous set of forecasts in October.<br />Continued government spending measures in Japan and the U.S., where Congress authorized a $900 billion package in late December, contributed to the improved forecasts. The IMF expects the U.S. economy to grow 5.1% this year and Japan’s to expand by 3.1%. However, it lowered its forecast for the euro area to 4.2% growth from 5.2%. The IMF is the global lender of last resort to countries in distress.<br />The stronger-than-expected recovery masks significant disparities between high-skilled workers and their less-educated counterparts, the IMF’s chief economist, Gita Gopinath, said in a December interview. Similarly, rich countries are faring better than poor ones as the global pandemic nears its first anniversary.</td>

So they have been looking for companionship at remote co-living spaces, where tenants rent furnished rooms in big, shared homes.<br />These former vacation homes, farms or converted hotels offer a shared office space and a place to sleep for those who want temporary accommodation.<br />European millennials have been at the forefront of this trend. Coconat—short for community and concentrated work in nature—is in a village outside Berlin. The 5-acre property, based in a converted manor, includes shared offices, a sauna, a swimming pond, a yoga studio and 20 rooms for guests who get three meals a day and pay less rent than for a Berlin apartment.<br />“Every room is taken, and it’s surprising,” said co-founder Julianne Becker. “The people really want to get out of the cities.”</td>

AT&T Inc.  plans to report its fourth-quarter results Wednesday.<br />Verizon last year pulled its sales projections and braced for a wave of past-due bills as millions of Americans lost their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic. As the year wore on, revenue losses were limited by Verizon’s more affluent customer base and the must-have nature of cellphone and home-internet service.</td>

Taiwan is expected to report a 1.9% expansion for the year Friday, according to Fitch Solutions.<br />The Bank of Korea attributed South Korea’s relative economic durability during the pandemic to its large manufacturing industry, well-established online shopping base and strong pandemic-response measures.<br />“The recovery of global demand for our mainstream products like semiconductors in the second half of the year contributed to the economic cushioning,” said Park Yang-su, director general at the Bank of Korea’s economics statistics department.</td>

In hospital critical-care units, they were seeing more younger people and women with serious cases of Covid-19, a disease that previously inflicted its worst symptoms largely on older patients and men.<br />The shift—backed up now by statistical studies—is part of an urgent puzzle preoccupying British public-health officials as they race to understand a strain of the virus that is more transmissible and, some studies indicate, could be deadlier than earlier versions.<br />One early hypothesis, scientists say, is that one of the virus’s genetic mutations makes it better at invading a greater number of cells inside the body, leading to serious sickness in people who with previous Covid-19 variants would only have had mild or no symptoms.<br />David Strain, a physician and instructor at the University of Exeter’s medical school who is also treating Covid-19 patients, said initial research paints a picture of a virus variant that is like a burglar that has become better at breaking and entering—into vulnerable cells in this case, not houses.<br />“We think that’s why it’s making people sicker as well as being more transmissible,” Dr. Strain said.</td>

      <td>The frenetic trading of options by retail investors isn’t large enough to disrupt the primary purpose of equity capital markets</td>
      <td>Once upon a time, short sellers were the hotshot outsiders, energetically assaulting fusty old Wall Street. Now they’re on the ramparts looking down as armies of day traders use options to send the value of heavily-shorted stocks like  GameStop Corp.  surging.<br />Professional investors are worried: How can financial markets function when stock movements are so obviously disconnected from fundamentals, played by both sides like a videogame?<br />Those worries are understandable but overblown. Here, a little international comparison is helpful: Unlike some other major global equity markets, frenetic individual investors are far from the point where they are really disrupting the real purpose of equity markets—to help companies to raise capital.<br />Retail traders are associated with market inefficiency, because they’re considered more likely to trade on noise, accelerating surges and dips. Volatility isn’t good for companies that want a placid, reliable environment to raise capital in. That’s part of the reason special-purpose acquisition vehicles, or SPACs, boomed in popularity last year, with both investors and issuers looking to avoid a choppy stock market.<br />But there is a difference of degree internationally. Retail order flows have reached 20% of the U.S. stock market’s total, according to UBS research, twice what they were in 2010. Off-exchange trading, which includes but isn’t limited to retail, is up to a record 48% of the total, compared with 2019 levels of more like 35%. That is nothing though, relative to the over 80% that Chinese retail traders account for, according to recent research by U.S. and China-based academics.</td>

      <td>With the fate of next summer’s Tokyo Olympics still teetering, USA Swimming is cutting its blockbuster Olympic trials in half, an attempt to make the event safer and more manageable for the pandemic era.<br />Trials organizers, in an effort to space out the athletes at CHI Health Center Arena in Omaha, Neb., no longer will host more than 1,700 swimmers at one giant eight-day event, as happened in 2016. Instead, they’ll stage two separate meets at the same Omaha arena in June.<br />Wave I will be a kind of wild-card meet for 550-650 lower-seeded swimmers on June 4-7. The top two finishers in each event will advance to the Wave II meet and compete against swimmers already qualified by their faster times.<br />Wave II, the main event, will include about 750 swimmers and take place June 13-20. The top 50 or so finishers in that meet, including swimmers who qualify in multiple events, will represent Team USA in Tokyo.<br />“We figured out this was the best option, and that it still allowed all athletes to have a crack at the Olympic trials, which, for many athletes is the pinnacle of their careers,” said Mike Unger, USA Swimming Chief Operating Officer. “But it also then allowed us to pick the best Olympic team.”</td>

But as auto makers spend billions to build more plug-in models in the U.S., investors are increasing their bets on companies looking to expand the supply chain for batteries and related materials in North America—a region that has long relied on imports for such components.<br />Sila Nanotechnologies Inc., a Silicon Valley startup that makes silicon anode materials used in batteries, is among the latest to attract Wall Street backing. The company plans to reveal Tuesday that it has raised $590 million in new funding, Chief Executive Gene Berdichevsky told The Wall Street Journal.<br />Much of that money will be used to build a factory in the U.S. for making battery materials, he said. The location hasn’t yet been selected.<br />Other battery-focused startups, such as California-based  Romeo Power Inc.  and Canadian mining firm  Lithium Americas Corp. , which has U.S. operations, have also recently tapped public markets. Romeo went public late last year, while Lithium Americas said Friday that it sold $400 million of stock in a public offering intended to finance a lithium project in Nevada.</td>

      <td>UBS  Group AG’s focus on the world’s rich is helping it power through the coronavirus pandemic with some of the best financial results in global banking, but a cloud over new Chief Executive Ralph Hamers is threatening to throw Switzerland’s largest lender off course this year.<br />UBS on Tuesday ramped up a share buyback program after 2020 net profit rose 54% from gains in its banking and wealth management units. The bank said it is meeting all of its financial targets and is anticipating lower levels of bad loans from the pandemic than many rivals because of its safer lending to Swiss borrowers and the global rich.<br />The strong results were overshadowed by a criminal investigation into Mr. Hamers, who became CEO on Nov. 1 after a two-month handover period. Just over a month later, a Dutch court ordered a fresh probe into his role in a money-laundering scandal at his former employer, ING Groep NV. UBS has said it is backing Mr. Hamers in the probe, which is expected to take a year or more.<br />UBS seeks to bank the world’s rich and help them manage their wealth. It also competes with Wall Street banks in market trading and in advising companies on stock and debt deals, and mergers and acquisitions. Both areas had a bumper year as wealth clients rotated their investments and investment banking customers traded more and brought deals to take advantage of a rise in asset prices from government and central-bank stimulus.<br />The Swiss bank said its performance allowed it to set aside more capital in the fourth quarter to buy back shares and that it will purchase at least $1.1 billion worth of stock in the first quarter. It said it could buy back 4 billion Swiss francs worth of shares, equivalent to $4.5 billion, in the next three years.</td>

      <td>Wall Street is offering bargains to the commodities industry for going green.<br />Two of the world’s largest commodity traders, Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd. and Gunvor Group, have lines of credit from banks that give them cheaper rates to finance reduced-carbon production of everything from oil to aluminum.  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. has a deal with European energy giant  Enel  SpA that offers incentives for the company to meet certain environmental targets by the end of 2022—and a penalty if those targets aren’t met.<br />Those discounts help produce and deliver the raw materials that power the global economy in a more sustainable way, some bankers and traders said. Green assets are already trendy on Wall Street, which sells a growing number of products aimed at improving the world and producing higher returns through so-called environmental, social and governance investing. The lending also helps banks, increasingly under pressure from shareholders and regulators, meet their own green-investing targets.<br />“There is an incredible hunger for clean assets,” said Neha Coulon, global head of ESG solutions at JPMorgan Chase. “At the end of every year, I saw ESG investing becoming more mainstream, but I wasn’t prepared for 2020 to be such a big year.”<br />The push for sustainability has prompted shifts throughout the commodities industry. Trafigura built a desk dedicated to trading low-carbon aluminum to keep up with demand for a cleaner version of the metal. Lightweight, recyclable and used in everything from electric cars to solar panels, aluminum still requires a large carbon footprint to produce, mostly because smelting processes have remained little changed for more than a century, industry experts said.</td>

      <td>The apartment business has weathered the Covid-19 pandemic better than most of the real-estate sector. That is starting to change.<br />Owners of multifamily buildings are falling behind on loan payments. Banks view a greater number of rental loans as high risk, and fewer lenders are available to help struggling developers with financing. Eviction protections, lower rent collections and unprecedented declines in the asking rent in some urban markets are also taking their toll on apartment owners.<br />Niche corners of the multifamily business that were popular with investors before the pandemic are now some of the worst off. Ratings companies have downgraded bonds tied to senior-housing and student-housing properties, and some co-living companies, where tenants lease rooms in shared apartments, are also struggling. Earlier this month, the co-living operator Quarters closed all of its U.S. operations, filing for 10 bankruptcies.<br />But the traditional rental-apartment business is showing cracks, too. During the pandemic, the share of total apartment debt that banks place into their highest-risk categories has ballooned to 16.9% from 4.6%, according to a December report from Trepp LLC, a real-estate data firm that compiled risk ratings from more than a dozen major banks.<br />“A lot of this was driven by people being in stress,” said Russell Hughes, a vice president at Trepp. Landlords requested payment leniency on their loans, and this was a major factor in banks raising their risk assessments, he added.</td>

Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin reaffirming their opposition to its elimination. Their statements earlier in the day signaled that Democrats don’t have the votes needed to kill the filibuster unilaterally, since that would require all 50 of them, plus Vice President Kamala Harris, to vote as a bloc.<br />President Biden, who served 36 years in the Senate, said during his presidential campaign that he would prefer to preserve the filibuster, unless GOP resistance to his legislative agenda made eliminating it necessary. Asked Friday whether Mr. Biden still opposes eliminating the filibuster, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: “The president’s position hasn’t changed.”<br />The Democratic senators “agree with President Biden’s and my view that no Senate majority should destroy the right of future minorities of both parties to help shape legislation,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement Monday night. In his statement, he pointed to a 2001 agreement—the last time there was a 50-50 Senate—as a model for 2021.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) had previously embraced that approach, which gave the parties equal seats on committees and let nominees and bills advance to the floor even if a committee vote was tied.</td>

Their goal is to banish Mr. Trump from running for office again. The result may instead be his acquittal and political revival.<br />Democrats have already forced one impeachment trial, resulting in acquittal and no notable decline in his political standing. He lost the election due to his handling of Covid and its consequences. But now Democrats want to do it once more with feeling, after Mr. Trump urged his supporters to march on the Capitol on Jan. 6 with a goal of overturning the Electoral College vote for Joe Biden.<br />We’ve said Mr. Trump’s actions—and failure to act to stop the riot as it unfolded—were an impeachable offense and urged him to resign. But now he is out of office and no longer the “imminent threat” that House Democrats said justified their rushed impeachment. The question is what good purpose a Senate trial will serve, and that isn’t apparent.<br />The Democratic case is that Mr. Trump must be punished lest any future President try something similar in his final days. A conviction by two-thirds of the Senate would also open him to a majority vote barring Mr. Trump from running for public office again. But what if he is acquitted?<br />One problem is whether such a trial is even constitutional. We’ve run op-eds arguing pro and con. The language in the Constitution refers to impeachment against a President while in office, and Mr. Trump is now a private citizen. Chief Justice John Roberts doesn’t seem to believe he needs to preside over the trial because the Constitution stipulates that role for the Chief only for a President. Senior Democrat Pat Leahy will preside instead.</td>

He pulled out all the buzzwords that make Davosians swoon: “inclusive growth,” “green development,” “global governance” and “consensus building.”<br />The Davos website effused that this was a “historic opportunity for collaboration.” But Mr. Xi’s People’s Liberation Army told a different story over the weekend, menacing Taiwan with back-to-back military flyovers of more than a dozen planes. The provocation is a reminder that while the government has changed hands in Washington, it hasn’t in Beijing, which still sees extending sovereignty over Taiwan—possibly by force—as a priority.<br />Mr. Xi said in his speech that “the strong should not bully the weak,” but that admonition doesn’t seem to apply to his own government. “We should stay committed to international law and international rules, instead of seeking one’s own supremacy,” he added. Tell that to the people of Hong Kong who were promised autonomy through 2047 in a treaty Beijing signed with Britain but are now being arrested for even mild political dissent.<br />Judging from comments by Secretary of State nominee Tony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in their Senate hearings, the new Administration seems to recognize the importance of Taiwan’s independence and U.S. predominance in the Western Pacific.<br />Yet many in the Administration are also true believers in the types of global-governance values Mr. Xi claimed to endorse in his Davos speech, which they see as the best way to solve problems like climate change. Unlike Mr. Xi, they aren’t experienced in using those values as a shield to relentlessly push their own national interest.</td>

      <td>Even a federal bribe isn’t enough to get them back teaching in classrooms.</td>
      <td>The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) this weekend vetoed Joe Biden’s plan to reopen schools during his first 100 days by voting to continue remote learning indefinitely. The union is taking kids hostage to extract more money from Congress with no guarantee that it will release them if it does.<br />Chicago’s Board of Education had required K-8 teachers to show up at schools on Monday to prepare for a return to in-person instruction on Feb. 1. The union doesn’t care. Seventy-one percent of CTU voting members rejected a return to in-person learning until schools are “safe”—meaning whenever teachers feel like going back.<br />The district has installed air purifiers in classrooms, conducted ventilation tests, increased cleaning and procured rapid testing, among other things. It will begin vaccinating teachers next month. There’s no excuse for teachers not to return to classrooms.<br />“Students in over 130 private and parochial schools and over 2,000 early learning centers across the city have been safely learning in their classrooms since the fall, and we must provide that same option to our families who, through no fault of their own, have been unable to make remote learning work for their children,” Chicago Public Schools said. “We’ve seen grades, attendance, and enrollment drop significantly for many of our students in recent months, and the impact has been felt most by our Black and Latinx students.”<br />After the union vote, the district postponed teachers’ start-date until Wednesday to provide time “to resolve our discussions without risking disruption to student learning.” Haven’t district leaders read the children’s book “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie”? Accommodating unreasonable demands leads to more unreasonable demands.</td>

The man was beaten and cut with an unknown object, and suffered slashes to his head, torso and hand, the officials said. The suspects then took the man’s clothes and cell phone before fleeing in private vehicles, the officials said.<br />The victim, who is from Brooklyn, was transported to Manhattan’s Bellevue Hospital, where he was in stable condition.<br />A NYPD spokeswoman said Monday that investigators were still working to determine the motive of the suspects. The NYPD circulated a video of the incident over the weekend in an effort to identify the suspects.</td>

      <td>Spending packages need triggers to sustain aid when the recovery lags and cut it off when things improve.</td>
      <td>President Biden has proposed a bold and ambitious $1.9 trillion plan for economic recovery. The plan would benefit from one important change: It should be contingent on the pace of recovery. The Biden plan provides substantial support for the economy through the end of September but essentially ends on that date. It could be improved by including provisions that automatically continue assistance as long as the economy is weak and needs it. In exchange, these provisions could also phase out aid more quickly than Mr. Biden proposes if the economy rebounds faster than expected. Most important, this recession insurance should be made permanent to mitigate future recessions.<br />The economy is more than 11 million jobs short of where it should be, and important labor-market indicators have steadily worsened since the summer, including long-term unemployment and the number of unemployed workers not on temporary layoff. The supply-side constraints created by the virus are the biggest limit on the economy. Aggressive deployment of vaccines plus testing and other measures will likely solve the supply problem over the coming months.<br />A full recovery will require more than open restaurants. People must also be able to afford to eat in those restaurants. That’s where the demand side comes in: The Biden plan would provide relief for many of the households that need it most, including low-income families and the unemployed, turbocharging demand to meet the expanded supply.<br />Covid has had an unprecedented impact on both supply and demand. Anyone who ventures a confident prediction about the course of jobs, inflation or any other aspect of the economy may be wrong and is certainly wrong to be confident.<br />The pace and magnitude of virus mutations raise the concern that the virus will become immune to current vaccines. The ossification of unemployment could make the last phases of the recovery slower and more painful as people are unable to return to their old jobs quickly and may need to find new ones in different industries. Global events could disrupt the U.S. economy. For all of these reasons more rescue and relief may be needed long after September.</td>

      <td>In the race to vaccinate people for Covid-19, everyone agrees front-line health workers, the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions should get priority. But one vital group is being overlooked. Even worse, some are criticizing efforts to vaccinate them as some sort of effort to “cut the line.”<br />I’m referring to the thousands of people working to produce critical vaccines, medications and diagnostics for Covid-19. In addition to  Pfizer  and Moderna, my company,  Emergent BioSolutions ,  has been ramping up manufacturing of hundreds of millions of vaccine doses for partners like  Johnson & Johnson  and  AstraZeneca  in close coordination with the federal government.<br />Emergent’s employees are essential to the Covid-19 response, and we have gone to extraordinary lengths to protect them. Unfortunately, our strict safety protocols, like the use of personal protective equipment, disinfection of work areas and regular testing, are no guarantee against infection.<br />Over the past year, we have quarantined hundreds of team members—nearly one-third of our small on-site workforce. Some were exposed outside the workplace, but the primary cause of quarantine is potential exposure to an infected fellow employee. This situation puts a tremendous strain on our 24/7 operations. Absenteeism means other employees have to work multiple back-to-back shifts to avoid a manufacturing shutdown. So far, we’ve avoided delays in vaccine production, but the risk is real—we briefly had to slow down operations at another facility because of Covid-related absenteeism.<br />This situation also can create a national-security risk. In addition to Covid-19 vaccines, Emergent produces medical countermeasures for deadly threats like anthrax, botulism and smallpox. This manufacturing can’t simply be turned on and off. That’s why the Department of Homeland Security has designated Emergent as a part of America’s critical national-security infrastructure in cases of emergency.</td>

That was 40 years ago and I’ve loved every challenge the restaurant business has thrown my way—until now. I fear the work of four decades won’t survive the coming months without a plan that truly addresses my industry’s needs.<br />In April I sat down with my wife, 22-year-old daughter and 18-year-old son and told them we may lose some, or all, of the six restaurants and two bars we owned. In the same conversation, I told them there was also a strong chance we might have to sell our home.<br />Nearly a year into the pandemic, I have permanently closed two restaurants and a bar—leaving 52 people to have difficult conversations with their own families. For the first time in my career, I have to ask for help.<br />The pandemic is unfair. A tiny airborne particle threatens everything I’ve spent 40 years working to build. My teams have done nothing wrong. We work hard, we’re honest, we roll with the punches, and we always do our best to serve our customers and community.</td>

      <td>Nations decide which problems to solve through politics. Global elites already know what problems need solving. Just ask them.</td>
      <td>Refugee Run is an immersive theatrical experience at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which billionaires and other global elites pretend to be refugees for a little over an hour. In one promotional video, corporate executives wearing $1,000 loafers “escape” their “village” and make their way to a “refugee camp,” where they must “bribe” actors playing camp guards. Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg flashes on-screen to attest: “I found it incredible . . . that you can put yourself in a room like this and feel as much as you feel.” This focus on eliciting emotional responses from the wealthy and powerful at an Alpine ski resort, rather than providing material assistance to actual refugees, makes Refugee Run an appropriate charity for the Davos set.<br />The founder and executive chairman of the Davos forum is Klaus Schwab, a German engineer and former academic. Mr. Schwab is a prominent evangelist for the virtues of “stakeholder capitalism,” the belief that corporations answer notjust to shareholders—that’s ordinary capitalism—but to communities, marginalized minorities and society in general. This vision for capitalism has steadily become the dominant philosophy among Western business elites and even some Republicans.<br />Mr. Schwab argues in “Stakeholder Capitalism: A Global Economy That Works for Progress, People and Planet” that to make the world a better place captains of industry must work together to solve global problems. “Building such a virtuous economic system is not a utopian ideal,” he writes. “Most people want to do good. But what’s been missing in recent decades is a clear compass to guide those in leading positions in our society and economy.” Mr. Schwab believes that he possesses such a compass.<br />Unfortunately, his compass points in multiple directions. In lieu of mere profit, Schwab argues that businesses should pursue the four P’s: Principles of Governance, Planet, People and Prosperity. He offers no guiding principle for how these vague, expansive and competing interests ought to be weighed and weighted.<br />Like other stakeholder proponents, Mr. Schwab cherry-picks examples to support his claim that shareholder capitalism is somehow ignoble or prone to disaster rather than deriving his claims from the totality of available examples. He predictably invokes Enron but fails to mention Volkswagen, Wirecard or Wells Fargo—examples of large-scale fraud perpetuated by executives who long escaped scrutiny in part by ostentatiously championing fashionable social causes.</td>

      <td>California wants to do it, and Biden wants to help—even though it will violate the law and cost us all.</td>
      <td>President Biden can’t mandate that we all drive electric cars, but he’s opening the gates to an electric Trojan horse. In a day-one executive order, Mr. Biden began the process of rescinding a Trump administration rule, the first step toward greenlighting California’s electric car agenda. California and like-minded states plan to impose electric cars through production quotas—whether drivers want the cars or not.<br />California regulators call it a “zero-emissions vehicle” standard, but green propaganda shouldn’t obscure what’s really going on. Start with federal law. It requires the transportation secretary to set national average fuel-economy performance standards for car makers at the “maximum feasible” level without restricting consumer choice. Instead of mandating a given technology, federal fuel-economy standards allow car makers the freedom to decide how best to improve fuel economy at the lowest cost.<br />To promote efficiency, federal law broadly forbids state regulations “related to fuel economy standards.” Courts have held that this law forbids electric car quotas and similarly meddlesome command-and-control policies that seek to dictate how car makers should meet federal performance standards. The Golden State argues that a special exception made for California regulations in the Clean Air Act should also be read into the federal fuel-economy law. But that law’s text says no. It forbids fuel-economy regulation by any state—no exceptions.<br />Next, the policy. Congress pre-empted state laws in 1975 because sprinkling policies like state electric car quotas on top of federal fuel-economy standards makes no sense. An electric car quota in California would force car makers to meet national fuel-economy standards using one of the most expensive fuel-efficiency technologies, undermining consumer choice and increasing costs. One study from 2019 estimates that state electric car quotas will cost an extra $400 for every new car nationwide by 2025.<br />Those costs won’t be distributed equally. The zero-emission vehicle standard is in effect a hidden regressive tax paid by ordinary car buyers to subsidize luxury cars for the wealthy. It takes $400 from the wallets of low- and moderate-income car buyers and hands it over primarily to six-figure-income electric car buyers, who enjoy many other subsidies, too.</td>

      <td>Long Island City, N.Y.<br />Performance artist and director Elliot Reed, at MoMA PS1 as part of “This Longing Vessel: The Studio Museum Artist in Residence 2019-20,” offers a handsome array of his two-dimensional, three-dimensional and video work that can be viewed, four gallery-goers at a time, on the museum’s second floor. “This Longing Vessel” (which also includes work by E. Jane and Naudline Pierre and is associated with MoMA PS1’s multiyear partnership with Harlem’s Studio Museum) is promoted as presenting “the intersection between queerness and Blackness as a waypoint to yearn from, reach toward and leap beyond.”<br />For his part, Mr. Reed offers a gallery with two high-gloss aluminum signs, one emblazoned with the word “BLOOD,” the other with “NUDITY”; an empty track suit laid out on a bed of salt; and a five-screen video display with Mr. Reed at its center, flanked by the four musicians of the JACK string quartet. Mr. Reed gesticulates and recites a text, which can be read in full at mo.ma/elliotreed, in which he muses on both contemporary and historical criminal acts targeting Black victims—a “real-life horror story.” The musicians take their cues from some of Mr. Reed’s readings. And now, as launched on Saturday and continuing on Feb. 6, Feb. 20 and March 6, Mr. Reed is presenting a series of “Duets” in PS1’s converted school building, in places inaccessible to museum visitors.<br />Each excursion, streamed to video screens in the museum and on MoMA’s website, as well as to PS1’s Instagram account, will have Mr. Reed and an invited artist improvise an hour-long performance aimed at, according to MoMA’s online calendar, “reinterpreting COVID-19 precautions as a formal challenge.” In the first, Mr. Reed was joined by dancer-choreographer Raymond Pinto. The Feb. 6 duet will include choreographer Ishmael Houston-Jones; the one on Feb. 20, performance artist Ron Athey; and the final one a collaborator still to be decided.<br />The initial performance unfolded as gently poetic rather than strongly polemical. Except for passing references to asbestos and mesothelioma as Mr. Pinto and Mr. Reed maneuvered together under some insulated pipes of the museum’s furnace room, their duet was a mostly playful one in which the two men, in janitor-style coveralls explored their confines and exchanged thoughts while maintaining social distance in the lower reaches of PS1.</td>

Mr. Black paid Epstein a total of $148 million, plus a $10 million donation to his charity—far more than was previously known.<br />Mr. Black wrote in a letter to Apollo’s fund investors that he would cede the role of CEO to co-founder Marc Rowan on or before his 70th birthday on July 31 while retaining the role of chairman. In the letter, a copy of which was viewed by the Journal, Mr. Black detailed other governance changes he is recommending to the board, including the appointment of more independent directors and the elimination of Apollo’s dual-class share structure.<br />Mr. Black also pledged to donate $200 million of his family’s money to women’s initiatives.</td>

Unlike some of their ’90s peers, Foo Fighters has never embarrassed itself—there have been no ill-advised genre exercises à la Weezer, no indulgent multi-disc concept albums à la the Smashing Pumpkins. But Foo Fighters has never transcended down-the-middle rock, either. The group experiments within clearly defined parameters, which is both a strength and a weakness.</td>

Established and insurgent parties are struggling over Europe’s future, stable majorities are often elusive and leaders are searching for ways to overcome long-term economic underperformance—nowhere more so than in Italy.<br />Rome’s latest political breakdown is likely to cause concern in the capitals of Europe’s stronger economies, such as Germany, which last year agreed to underwrite a massive European Union investment plan for economic recovery from the coronavirus.<br />Italy, due to receive more than €200 billion in EU funds, the equivalent of about $243 billion, is the plan’s biggest beneficiary. But Italian leaders’ inability to agree on a coherent economic strategy reduces the chances that the EU’s third-biggest economy will use the funds effectively.<br />At stake is not just Italy’s chances of escaping from its long economic decline, and of stabilizing its sky-high national debt, but also the political trust between northern and southern Europe that the euro needs for its long-term viability.</td>

      <td>Moderna Inc.  said its Covid-19 vaccine appeared to protect against emerging variants of the coronavirus in laboratory tests, but as a precaution it would test whether a booster shot improves immune responses and develop a new vaccine targeting the strain first identified in South Africa.<br />The company said Monday its vaccine produced immune-system agents known as neutralizing antibodies that worked against the emerging virus variants tested, including strains first evident in the U.K. and South Africa.<br />That means the Moderna vaccine likely still protects against the emerging strains, but a weaker response to the South Africa variant suggests the hazards of a virus that could mutate in significant ways while countries race to vaccinate against it.<br />The new strains appear to spread more easily from person to person, and there are signs that the U.K. variant is more deadly than earlier forms of the virus. The strains appear to be spreading around the world, prompting U.S. health authorities to warn the variant first detected in the U.K. could become dominant by March.<br />The variant first found in South Africa hasn’t been detected in the U.S., Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top-infectious disease expert, said Sunday. To curb the spread of new strains into the U.S., President Biden on Monday restricted travel from South Africa and re-established a ban on most travel into the U.S. from Europe, the U.K. and Brazil.</td>

      <td>Redesign had been pushed by Obama administration but wasn’t completed during Trump’s tenure</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The White House said the Treasury Department was resuming efforts to put escaped slave turned abolitionist Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.<br />Putting Tubman’s image on the currency had been undertaken by the Obama administration but the work wasn’t completed during former President Donald Trump’s tenure. “We’re exploring ways to speed up that effort,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.<br />Ms. Psaki said it was important that the nation’s currency and notes “reflect the history and diversity of our country, and Harriet Tubman’s image gracing the new $20 note would certainly reflect that.”<br />The redesign of the bill would place a woman on the front of U.S. paper currency for the first time in more than a century and replace President Andrew Jackson, a slave owner, who would move to the back of the note.<br />The Treasury Department’s watchdog agreed in 2019 to review the agency’s plan after Democrats said the Trump Treasury Department had intentionally slow-walked the proposal.</td>

      <td>Between ‘The Marksman’ and ‘Honest Thief,’ the actor stars in two films that have hit No. 1 in Covid-hobbled theaters.</td>
      <td>In the last decade Liam Neeson has played a lot of grizzled loners who take out bad guys using grit and guns. Mining that vein has paid off in a new way for the 68-year-old action star during the pandemic. He has scored two No. 1 movies in the last three months, by supplying multiplexes with much-needed new releases and audiences willing to turn out for his brand of movie.<br />“Maybe these stories hark back to a simpler time of a man taking on evil people in a very basic, fundamental fashion,” Mr. Neeson said in an email.<br />In “The Marksman,” released Jan. 15, he stars as a hardscrabble Arizona rancher who protects a boy who crosses the border illegally with his mother to escape a Mexican crime cartel. Ticket sales were strongest in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Florida and Texas. The film, made for about $30 million, is now in its second week as the highest grossing movie, with total ticket sales of $6.1 million—in the one-third of domestic theaters currently open. A similar pattern played out in October (when more theaters were open) for the release of “Honest Thief,” featuring Mr. Neeson as a bank robber double-crossed by FBI agents. The movie grossed about $14 million domestically.<br /><br /></td>

      <td>Move by Inspector General Horowitz follows reports that Trump pushed DOJ to ask Supreme Court to invalidate President Biden’s win</td>
      <td>The Justice Department’s inspector general said Monday his office will investigate whether department officials “engaged in an improper attempt” to overturn President Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.<br />The announcement comes after news reports that former President Donald Trump considered moving to replace the acting attorney general with another official ready to pursue unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. The Wall Street Journal also reported that Mr. Trump pushed the Justice Department to ask the Supreme Court to invalidate Mr. Biden’s win.<br />Inspector General Michael Horowitz said in a statement that his office will probe “whether any former or current DOJ official engaged in an improper attempt to have DOJ seek to alter the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election,” adding only that the investigation will “encompass all allegations that may arise that are within the scope” of its jurisdiction.<br />Mr. Trump’s persistent efforts to involve the Justice Department in his attempts to undo the outcome of the November election failed due to pushback from his own appointees in the department, people familiar with the matter have said. The efforts have drawn sharp rebuke from Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), who announced Saturday that the Senate Judiciary Committee has initiated its own review of Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign at the Justice Department.<br />As part of that effort, Mr. Trump explored a plan to replace then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen with another senior Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, an ally who had expressed a willingness to use the department’s power to help the former president continue his unsuccessful legal battles contesting the election results, people familiar with the matter said.</td>

      <td>The comments come as the new U.S. administration prepares to rally allies to challenge Beijing on a range of issues</td>
      <td>NEW YORK—Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a veiled warning against the new Biden administration’s preparations to rally allies to challenge Beijing on a range of issues, urging multilateral coordination to tackle global challenges such as the pandemic.<br />“To build small circles or start a new Cold War, to reject, threaten or intimidate others, to willfully impose decoupling, supply disruption or sanctions, to create isolation or estrangement, will only push the world into division and even confrontation,” Mr. Xi told the World Economic Forum, which this year is convening online instead of in the ski town of Davos, Switzerland.<br />His comments—from his office desk placed in front of a rendering of the Great Wall, designed to deter foreign invasions—came days after President Biden took office in the U.S. The Chinese president said Beijing would continue to open its economy and honor its global commitments, but emphasized that each country had a right to blaze its own path.<br />In urging multilateral engagement to discuss disagreements, Mr. Xi offered no initiatives to address Western criticisms of Chinese policies in such areas as trade, human rights and the military.<br />Anger simmers in many capitals over China’s lack of transparency over the coronavirus outbreak since it first appeared in Wuhan and the government’s refusal to address scientific questions about the efficacy of its vaccine program.</td>

      <td>Ohio Republican says Washington gridlock influenced his decision not to run again</td>
      <td>Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), a longtime figure in the Republican establishment, said he wouldn’t run for re-election in 2022, creating an open Senate seat in a competitive state.<br />Mr. Portman said in a statement that gridlock in Washington informed his decision to not seek re-election. The former White House budget chief was among a bipartisan group of senators involved in crafting the $900 billion Covid-19 relief bill that former President Donald Trump signed into law late last year.<br />“I don’t think any Senate office has been more successful in getting things done, but honestly, it has gotten harder and harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress on substantive policy, and that has contributed to my decision,” he said.<br />Mr. Portman, 65 years old, is the second Republican from a competitive state to say he won’t run for re-election in 2022, when Republicans hope to take back control of the Senate. Sen. Pat Toomey, a spending hawk from Pennsylvania, also said he won’t run again.<br />The Senate is currently split 50-50, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tiebreaking vote.</td>
