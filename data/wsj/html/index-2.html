He was 93.<br />Mr. Mondale had died peacefully of natural causes, said Kathy Tunheim, a family spokeswoman. He had received numerous calls in recent days from past and present political leaders and enjoyed sharing memories with them, she said.<br />Mr. Mondale, the 42nd vice president, was credited with boosting the status of the office with his deep involvement in shaping policy, influencing administration appointments and conducting foreign policy negotiations.<br />“I was the first vice president to be in the White House working daily with the president,” Mr. Mondale said in a 2008 documentary about his life.<br />Before agreeing to be Jimmy Carter’s 1976 Democratic running mate, Mr. Mondale—known as “Fritz” to family, friends and many voters—wrote a memo outlining his expectations, should they win. Among Mr. Mondale’s demands was that he be invited to all cabinet meetings and that the two men would confer at least weekly.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration plans to make an additional 22,000 seasonal guest-worker visas available this year ahead of the summer season, according to people familiar with the decision.<br />This is on top of the current 66,000 visas now available annually to seasonal employers, including landscapers, resort owners and county fairs, which look to add staff for their busy seasons.<br />The decision comes just weeks after the Biden administration lifted a ban on the guest-worker visas and other work visas imposed by the Trump administration last June amid the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. A small number of the total additional visas will be set aside for applicants from the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, which together are sending the largest number of migrant families and children to the U.S. border seeking asylum, the people said.<br />It couldn’t be determined when the administration plans to announce the additional visas, or when they might become available to businesses.<br />The seasonal-worker program, known as the H-2B visa program, enables U.S. employers to hire as many as 66,000 temporary foreign workers a year, with the allotments split evenly between the winter and summer seasons.</td>

Maxine Waters, the House Financial Services Committee chair, might have poisoned the Derek Chauvin trial now reaching its conclusion in Minneapolis.<br />That’s the view expressed Monday by Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, who is presiding over the prosecution of Mr. Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd last May. Defense attorney Eric Nelson urged Judge Cahill to declare a mistrial after Ms. Waters made incendiary remarks to a crowd of protesters in Brooklyn Center near Minneapolis on the weekend.<br />Judge Cahill denied the request but said, “I’ll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned.”<br />The judge added that “I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function.” He’s right in his wish, and he could be right about an appeal depending on how the jury rules in the case.<br />Ms. Waters tried to rile up the crowd to protest an acquittal. “I hope we get a verdict that says guilty, guilty, guilty,” she said. “And if we don’t, we cannot go away. We’ve got to stay on the street. . . . We get more active, we’ve got to get more confrontational.”</td>

      <td>The Food and Drug Administration is under scrutiny for giving too much weight to risks over benefits in recommending to pause  Johnson & Johnson ’s  Covid-19 vaccine. This trade-off is also at the heart of another heated debate over whether the FDA should approve the first drug shown to slow the progression in Alzheimer’s disease.<br />The FDA has long been plagued by a culture of bureaucratic over-caution. But during the late Obama and Trump presidencies it showed more flexibility and accelerated new medicines. Doctors who favor more government control as under Europe’s health systems, however, say the agency is approving too many high-priced drugs.  Biogen ’s  Alzheimer’s drug aducanumab is now ensnared in this fight.<br />More than six million Americans suffer from Alzheimer’s, and the number is expected to soar as the U.S. population ages. The disease’s tragic symptoms are well-known—progressive memory loss, abnormal behavior, and inability to perform everyday tasks.<br />Brain scans show the buildup of amyloid plaque and tangles of tau proteins, which typically begins decades before patients show cognitive problems. Hypertension, obesity, diabetes, smoking, poor sleep and the APOE4 gene variant put people at higher risk. But scientists have yet to identify Alzheimer’s cause.<br />This has frustrated the search for treatments, especially since Alzheimer’s usually is diagnosed after irreversible brain loss. Some medicines can temporarily improve memory, attention or mood, but none slow the neurological and cognitive degeneration.</td>

      <td>How much will Biden trade away in exchange for empty promises?</td>
      <td>These columns noted last year that putting John Kerry in charge of climate negotiations with China was a recipe for coming home “dressed in a barrel.” After Mr. Kerry’s sojourn to Shanghai last week, the question is: What happened to the barrel?<br />President Biden’s climate envoy emerged from two days of meetings with counterpart Xie Zhenhua with a joint statement that says little new. The two sides say they “are committed to cooperating with each other and with other countries to tackle the climate crisis.” Both countries will work “to strengthen implementation of the Paris Agreement” limiting carbon emissions. Mr. Kerry didn’t make any big concessions to Beijing, and Beijing didn’t make any new promises about emissions limits it would break anyway.<br />In one sense that’s a relief. But all this empty hot air isn’t cost free in U.S. prestige and the missed opportunity to engage in more important talks. Making climate the sole focus of an early visit tells the Chinese that the U.S. puts that single issue above everything else in the bilateral relationship. China is happy to jibber-jabber about climate with the Americans if it means not having to engage on Taiwan, Hong Kong, Beijing’s repression of Uighurs in Xinjiang, the South China Sea, North Korea, or intellectual property theft.<br />But Beijing is clear that it will ignore any carbon-emissions commitments that might impinge on China’s economic growth. “Some countries are asking China to do more on climate change,” deputy foreign minister Le Yucheng said last week. “I am afraid this is not very realistic.”<br />Instead of triggering a rethink in Beijing, Mr. Kerry’s Shanghai jaunt gave China’s leaders a new opportunity to go on the public-relations offensive. “China welcomes the U.S. return to the Paris agreement and expects the U.S. side to uphold the agreement,” vice-premier Han Zheng told Mr. Kerry in a jab at Washington’s withdrawal from the pact under President Trump. Mr. Kerry also flattered Beijing by all but begging President Xi Jinping to join another global climate confab later this week.</td>

      <td>The union failure to organize an Amazon warehouse in Alabama shows the independence of modern workers. But never fear, President Biden’s infrastructure plan is here with stealthy coercion to aid Big Labor.<br />Mr. Biden wants $17 billion for ports, inland waterways and ferries—which could be beneficial amid port congestion. But note the fine print: “This includes a Healthy Ports program to mitigate the cumulative impacts of air pollution on neighborhoods near ports, often communities of color.”<br />What’s a Healthy Ports program? The Biden Administration hasn’t laid out its details. But at the state level the model has been used to force independent truck drivers into the Teamsters. A case study is the Clean Trucks program adopted by the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in 2007, ostensibly to reduce diesel emissions. The plan banned trucks made before 1989, phased in higher emissions standards, and imposed a new cargo fee.<br />But the Port of Los Angeles gave the real game away with a provision banning independent owner-operator truckers. Within five years only employees of big trucking companies would have had access to the port, on the fact-free claim that these firms would invest in cleaner trucks. The plan also required trucking companies to sign a “concession agreement” that essentially gave the port control over employment practices.<br />This was a gift to the Teamsters. The feds deregulated trucking in 1980, and it has become a thriving bastion of blue-collar entrepreneurship. Most drivers prefer the flexibility and opportunity of the owner-operator model, and an estimated 80% of truckers that service the LA and Long Beach ports are independent contractors. Unions can’t legally organize them. The ports’ ban was a bid to re-regulate the industry under the guise of environmentalism.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court appeared unreceptive Monday to arguments that federal law allows noncitizens to seek lawful permanent residency when they entered the U.S. illegally but were later authorized to remain because of disasters in their homelands.<br />Some 400,000 people from about a dozen countries have temporary protected status permitting them to remain in the U.S. Despite the program’s name, all arrived at least five years ago. And the vast majority have been in the U.S. for decades, as successive administrations extended the reprieves originally granted because of natural or humanitarian disasters, such as the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.<br />In general, federal law requires that noncitizens be “inspected and admitted or paroled" to the U.S. and maintain lawful status as nonimmigrants in order to later seek permanent residency. While temporary protected status means noncitizens can legally stay in the U.S., the issue was whether it also confers lawful admission to the country.<br />Justice Samuel Alito expressed his doubts. Why, he asked, would Congress “leave it to the courts to infer that ‘lawful status as a nonimmigrant’ necessarily means inspection and admission?”<br />“Some of those forms of lawful status, such as asylum, do not require admission,” said Amy Saharia, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs. “But Congress chose a form of lawful status, nonimmigrant status, in which admission is inherent,” she said.</td>

The sale of the roughly 10% stake valued Oatly at about $2 billion. In February, the oat-milk maker confidentially filed for an IPO in the U.S.<br />The retail value of the plant-based dairy industry in the Americas is expected to hit $7 billion by 2025, according to Euromonitor.<br />The growing appetite for plant-based alternatives has put pressure on dairy-milk companies like  Dean Foods Co. , which filed for bankruptcy in 2019. Meanwhile, companies focused on plant-based alternatives have seen demand from consumers and investors alike take off in recent years. For example, shares of plant-based food maker  Beyond Meat Inc.  have increased 441% since it went public in 2019.</td>

Messrs. Nordean and Biggs, who have pleaded not guilty, were charged earlier this year and have been confined to home detention.<br />Timothy J. Kelly, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., said the severity of the charges facing the two men swayed his decision to detain them. For close to an hour, Judge Kelly read from the men’s social-media posts and other evidence filed by prosecutors, which recounted how both men had allegedly organized members of the Proud Boys to come to Washington on Jan. 6 and eventually to riot inside the Capitol.<br />In his decision, Judge Kelly cited Messrs. Nordean and Biggs’ lack of apparent remorse and described their alleged actions challenging the election results in stark terms. “Our republic is threatened by such conduct,” Judge Kelly said.<br />An earlier Wall Street Journal investigation found that the Proud Boys, who describe themselves as a men’s organization for “Western chauvinists,” were key instigators of the riot.</td>

      <td>The problem isn’t only the overreaction to the virus but the diminution of every other problem.</td>
      <td>What are the lessons of Covid-19? It depends who you ask. Some believe politicization of the pandemic response cost lives. Others believe a stronger U.S. public-health system would have reduced Covid-19 deaths significantly. Still others say lockdowns should have been longer and more stringent, or that they were ineffective. But one lesson that should transcend ideological differences: Don’t put one illness above all other problems in society, a condition known as “Covid mania.”<br />The novel coronavirus has caused suffering and heartbreak, particularly for older adults and their loved ones. But it also has a low mortality rate among most people and especially the young—estimated at 0.01% for people under 40—and therefore never posed a serious threat to social and economic institutions. Compassion and realism need not be enemies. But Covid mania crowded out reasoned and wise policy making.<br />Americans groaned when leaders first called for “two weeks to slow the spread” in March 2020. Months later, many of these same Americans hardly blinked when leaders declared that lockdowns should continue indefinitely. For months Covid had been elevated above all other problems in society. Over time new rules were written and new norms accepted.<br />Liberty has played a special role in U.S. history, fueling advances from independence to emancipation to the fight for equal rights for women and racial minorities.  Unfortunately, Covid mania led many policy makers to treat liberty as a nuisance rather than a core American principle.<br />Covid mania has also wreaked havoc on science and its influence on policy. While scientists’ passion for discovery and improving health has fueled research on the novel coronavirus, Covid mania has interpreted scientific advancements through an increasingly narrow frame. There has only been one question: How can scientific findings be deployed to reduce Covid-19 spread? It hasn’t mattered how impractical these measures may be. Discoveries that might have helped save lives, such as better outpatient therapies, were ignored because they didn’t fit the desired policy outcome.</td>

      <td>How to create new jobs by the thousands while ameliorating climate change.</td>
      <td>As President Biden convenes the virtual Leaders Summit on Climate later this month, America has a unique opportunity to spearhead a breakthrough approach to reducing carbon emissions.<br />About 80% of the world’s energy-related carbon emissions come from three critical sectors of the economy: power generation, commercial transportation and industrial manufacturing. Meaningful progress toward achieving the world’s climate goals requires emission reductions from these sectors.<br />One of the proven technologies available that could play a major role is carbon capture and storage, or CCS, the process of sequestering industrial emissions and safely storing them permanently underground. CCS also promises the potential to reduce carbon emissions significantly at a cost competitive to other solutions, especially for the manufacturing sector.<br />For the past three years at  ExxonMobil  we have been studying the concept of creating multiuser CCS “hubs” in industrial areas. They would be located near safe geologic storage sites. A CCS Innovation Zone would bring together government incentives and private-sector investment.<br />The heavy-industry area of the Houston Ship Channel on the Gulf Coast of Texas is an ideal location to apply this concept. This area houses one of the country’s largest sources of industrial emissions and is close to the Gulf of Mexico’s vast subsurface storage potential, where the CO2 would be permanently stored in the pore space of the rocks, thousands of feet below the seafloor.</td>

He proposed that the one thing too great for God to have shown us when he walked on the earth was his mirth. This suggests that the idea of a blissfulness we can’t even imagine was important to Chesterton. The mere possibility it’s true, that one thing our mortal minds can’t begin to fathom about God’s nature is his joyousness, offers me consolation beyond measure.<br />It comforts me because it means that laughter—one manifestation of earthly joy I love to experience—is far from mundane. It can be sanctifying. In its edifying echo can be heard something important about the Divine, unreachable by reason alone, if only we listen. Rollicking mysticism that effortlessly makes your sides hurt: What’s not to like about that?<br />This hopeful insight makes me think differently about cheery laughter. Does humor reflect something about God’s loving creativity, conceiving of something good out of nothing? Or his perfect patience in playing the long game with us, his imperfect creations, which surely requires a sense of humor?<br />Chesterton loved paradoxes, so it shouldn’t surprise us that the best and wisest jokes often come from children. I experienced such a moment the other day. My 10-year-old son, Jack, and I simultaneously noticed that my wife, Devin, had conspicuously removed her engagement ring and placed it atop a paper towel on the kitchen counter.<br />Surely she was going to put it back on, but there it sat, for a moment as foreboding to me as a Dear John letter. And not only to me. Picking up on the disquiet, Jack looked up and deadpanned: “Well, I guess she played us both for fools.”</td>

      <td>The president’s labor agenda is the same one he brought to Washington in 1973.</td>
      <td>“I’m a union guy,” says Joe Biden. He’s been saying this since he kicked off his presidential campaign at a Teamsters hall in Pittsburgh two years ago, and he said it again at the White House recently when he launched his American Jobs Plan.<br />So when a union sought to organize the 5,876 workers at an  Amazon  warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., it came as no surprise that Mr. Biden lent his imprimatur to the effort. What did come as a surprise was the outcome. The employees ended up voting against the union by a margin of more than 2 to 1—a blow to Big Labor, a shock to the press, and a personal embarrassment for the president, who plainly thought it would go the other way.<br />Though Labor Secretary Marty Walsh shrugged off the defeat, it isn’t a hopeful sign for the Biden administration’s efforts to reverse the slide in private-sector union membership from a peak of 34.8% in 1954 to 6.3% today. This American Jobs Plan is the latest in a White House agenda whose scope and spending has the media chattering about a “transformative presidency” on the order of FDR. The president loves to talk about a gleaming new economy full of green, unionized and well-paid jobs, but if Mr. Biden really does succeed in transforming the American economy, it will be with an industrial policy that takes us back to the 1970s.<br />For Mr. Biden shares the old prevailing assumption that labor and capital are enemies. In this dynamic, a union is the only hope for better pay and job security. To be fair, it might have looked that way for much of American history, with big strikes that often turned ugly on both sides a regular feature of American life.<br />Much of the press implicitly accepts this template too. Maybe that’s why so many stories from Alabama presented Amazon’s warehouse as if it were a sweatshop out of “Norma Rae,” the 1979 union drama that won Sally Field an Oscar. Except that in the real-life sequel, rather than looking to a union as the key to their job security and well being, the Amazon workers weighed the risks and benefits and said no thanks.</td>

      <td>In a rage, Khrushchev started yelling and cursing and threatened to “nuke” the White House, calling JFK a “millionaire’s whore.”</td>
      <td>On Oct. 23, 1962, a delegation of prominent Romanians arrived at the Kremlin to meet Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. Their host was foul of mood. Boorish and suspicious by nature, the strongman had spent a sleepless night deliberating with the Presidium over what to do in the escalating crisis for which Khrushchev himself was responsible: his secret installation, across that summer, of nuclear-weapons systems and some 40,000 Soviet troops in Cuba.<br />Aerial reconnaissance revealed the installations to the Americans on Oct. 14, and President Kennedy, in a televised address eight days later, announced a naval quarantine to block delivery of additional weapons to the island. All sides—with the exception, perhaps, of Fidel Castro, who relished Havana’s role at the center of world events—feared that any display of aggressiveness, or miscalculation, could trigger an apocalyptic nuclear exchange.<br />At the reception in their honor, the Romanians watched Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Malinovsky approach his boss with bad news: The U.S. Navy was on high alert, readying the blockade. “Khrushchev flew into a rage,” Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, a Romanian communist leader, reported later to Romanian intelligence. The premier was “yelling, cursing and issuing an avalanche of contradictory orders.” He “threatened to ‘nuke’ the White House, and cursed loudly every time anyone pronounced the words America or American.”<br />The vast literature on the Cuban Missile Crisis has made it a case study across scholarly disciplines: intelligence analysis, nuclear brinkmanship, game theory, organizational psychology. To this literature, the Oct. 23 Kremlin outburst—which appears midway through Serhii Plokhy’s superb “Nuclear Folly: A History of the Cuban Missile Crisis”—would appear to mark a significant contribution: an eyewitness account of one of the saga’s two key decision makers exhibiting not only uncontrolled anger but delirium. Khrushchev’s threat to “nuke” the White House, his “avalanche of contradictory orders,” constitute the most troubling behavior we could imagine in a leader “managing” such a crisis.<br />And indeed, a review of some acclaimed previous studies, such as Michael Beschloss’s “The Crisis Years” (1991), Michael Dobbs’s “One Minute to Midnight” (2008) and the revised edition of Graham T. Allison’s 1971 political-science classic “Essence of Decision” (1999, co-authored by Philip Zelikow), finds none of them mentioning this shocking scene—nor the one Gheorghiu-Dej witnessed at breakfast the next day. This time the bad news came from the KGB’s Vladimir Semichastny: a cable reporting that Kennedy had canceled a trip to Brazil to oversee the quarantine. Mr. Plokhy, a professor of history at Harvard, provides this account, drawing on Gheorghiu-Dej’s report: “Khrushchev’s face grew red as he read the cable. He started ‘cursing like a bargeman,’ threw the paper on the floor, and stamped on it with his heel. ‘That’s how I’m going to crush that viper,’ he shouted, also calling Kennedy a ‘millionaire’s whore.’ ”</td>

Mr. Chauvin’s defense attorney repeatedly showed clips of Mr. Floyd struggling with officers to build his case that the use of force was necessary.<br />Including closing arguments, attorneys at the trial showed about 166 clips of video taken from bystanders, police body cameras, street cameras and convenience store surveillance footage over the course of the trial, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.<br />“This case is exactly what you thought when you saw it first, when you saw that video. You can believe your eyes,” said Steve Schleicher, a special assistant attorney general for the prosecution, focusing its case on the nine minutes and 29 seconds Mr. Floyd was held on the ground. “It’s what you felt in your gut. What you now know in your heart. This wasn’t policing. It was murder.”<br />Defense attorney Eric Nelson, who has argued that Mr. Floyd died of a heart condition and the fentanyl and methamphetamine found in his system, asked jurors to consider what a reasonable officer would have done to deal with a subject who wasn’t complying with orders, had thwarted their efforts to get him into a squad car and appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</td>

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives traced the two weapons used in the attack and found that Mr. Hole purchased the rifles legally in July and September 2020, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said.<br />Indiana has a red-flag law that allows police to seize a firearm from a suspect who is considered to be a danger to himself or others. Any seizure requires a court hearing within 14 days to determine the suspect’s threat level. A finding of dangerousness might lead not only to the seizure of the firearm but to a ban on obtaining others.<br />While Mr. Hole was on the radar of law enforcement as someone with mental-health issues and potentially violent tendencies, he never had such a hearing, said Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears.<br />In March 2020, his mother contacted law enforcement to report he might try to commit “suicide by cop.” Mr. Hole was temporarily committed at a local hospital for evaluation of his mental-health needs that month by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, and police seized a shotgun at his residence.</td>

      <td>The band’s new release does more than stave off extinction, maintaining its signature sound with extra poignancy.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />In his 2001 book, “Our Band Could Be Your Life,” journalist Michael Azerrad tells the story of the American rock-music underground in the 1980s by focusing on the stories of 13 important groups from the decade. This was the era after the initial wave of punk rock but before the explosion of what came to be called alternative rock in the 1990s. Scanning the list of chapters now, one realizes that most of the featured outfits either split up years ago—noise-rockers Big Black, Minneapolis’s Hüsker Dü—or, like the Replacements, stopped making records, forming periodically to make some money playing festivals or on reunion tours. It’s difficult for any band to keep it together for 30-plus years, but it’s even harder for those at the margins, living from one gig to the next.<br />One act from Mr. Azerrad’s book, however, is not only active but making some of the best records of its career: Dinosaur Jr., the Amherst, Mass., trio fronted by singer and guitarist J Mascis, returns Friday with its 12th studio LP, “Sweep It Into Space” (Jagjaguwar). The strong new collection continues the group’s unlikely second act and holds its own among late-’80s classics.</td>

      <td>Petitioners say Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s rulings shouldn’t be withheld from public without justification</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Civil-liberties organizations are asking the Supreme Court to give the public access to past decisions by a classified foreign-intelligence court that authorized the expansion of mass surveillance since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.<br />A petition filed Monday asks the justices to review rulings by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and its appellate panel that gave the executive branch unlimited power to decide whether those courts’ decisions can be made public. The appeal argues that the First Amendment provides the same right of access to surveillance-court decisions as it does to those of other courts, where information can be withheld from the public only upon specific showings, such as damage to national security.<br />“These opinions and orders address, among other matters, the lawfulness of bulk email searches, the government’s authority to surreptitiously install malware on Americans’ computers, and the use of warrantless internet surveillance for cybersecurity purposes,” the petition says. “Although the FISC’s rulings on these matters may have broad implications for the rights of Americans, the public has been entirely deprived of access to them without any judicial determination that such secrecy is justified.”<br />The groups seeking access include the American Civil Liberties Union, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and Yale Law School’s Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic. They are represented by Theodore Olson, solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration, which implemented the mass-surveillance programs. Mr. Olson has argued before the surveillance court’s appellate panel.<br />“This specialized court originally had a narrow role but today it routinely issues decisions that have far-reaching implications for Americans’ rights,” Mr. Olson said. “It’s crucial to the legitimacy of the foreign-intelligence system, and to the democratic process, that the public have access to the court’s significant opinions.”</td>

      <td>Companies are feeling pressure from younger customers and their own employees to take a position on voting rights, other issues</td>
      <td>Once upon a time, it was pretty simple to compose a political strategy for a big American corporation: Give some political contributions to mainstream Republican politicians who could be counted on to push agreeable tax and regulatory policies, find a few dollars for some moderate Democrats to provide a bit of bipartisan insurance, and then keep your mouth shut when political debates flared up.<br />Well, those were the good old days. Today, the strategy of writing the check and then crouching on the sidelines increasingly is being overtaken by corporate activism in the political arena.<br />The question is: Why now?<br />The signs of this new climate are pretty obvious, and widely noted. Some business leaders and their companies openly objected to Republican attempts to stop certification of the 2020 presidential election and cut off contributions to lawmakers who supported the effort. Coca-Cola Co. and Delta Air Lines Inc. publicly objected to a new law on voting procedures in their home state of Georgia.<br />Hundreds of business leaders and companies, including  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. and  Netflix Inc.,  last week signed onto a two-page ad in The Wall Street Journal and other publications declaring that they “defend the right to vote and oppose any discriminatory legislation,” an implicit rebuke of voting bills Republicans are pushing in dozens of states.</td>

      <td>A cryptocurrency that was created as a joke exploded into plain view on Wall Street on Monday, with a surge in dogecoin sending its 2021 return above 8,000%—more than double the gains on the S&P 500, including dividends, since 1988.<br />Dogecoin’s rise from a quirky meme into a widely traded asset worth over $50 billion—more than  Marriott International Inc.  or  Ford Motor Co. —is the latest act of financial alchemy by rapidly moving individual investors who have used access to no-fee trading platforms and a wave of government stimulus money to transform markets over the past year.<br />The cryptocurrency’s rise is reminiscent of  GameStop  Corp.’s  stunning advance earlier this year, an episode in which traders congregating on Reddit and other social-media platforms made a past-prime mall retailer into a stock-market superpower.<br />This time, dogecoin’s buyers have gone a step further, turning what was meant as a parody into a real asset, providing some traders who piled in early with unimaginable gains. The latest stage of the frenzy centers on Tuesday having been deemed “Doge Day” in online forums, a loosely organized bid to push the price of the cryptocurrency to $1, from about 39 cents on Monday and less than a penny in January.<br />Both episodes underscore the scale and potency of the current retail-trading environment, in which organized efforts in online communities can make a surprisingly large impact on market prices. They also reflect expectations that prices will continue rising, and as such they embody risks that these sudden fortunes will be wiped out when the winds of the markets shift.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden met with a bipartisan group of lawmakers about infrastructure Monday, continuing discussions about possibly narrowing the scope of his $2.3 trillion plan or altering its planned tax increases.<br />“I am prepared to compromise, prepared to see what we can do and what we can get together on,” Mr. Biden said in the Oval Office as the meeting got under way. “It’s a big package but there are a lot of needs,” he said.<br />The meeting is the latest in a series Mr. Biden has held with lawmakers in both parties about his proposal, which offers funding for improving transportation, expanding access to broadband, rebuilding schools and funding elder care, among other priorities. The plan also calls for raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and increasing taxes on U.S. companies’ foreign earnings.<br />Some Senate Republicans, critical of the corporate tax increases and the broad scope of Mr. Biden’s infrastructure plan, have started discussing making a counteroffer in the realm of $600 billion to $800 billion. Republicans have indicated that they would want to focus on spending money on building roads and bridges, along with expanding access to broadband, while excluding other parts of Mr. Biden’s plan, such as providing $400 billion for caring for elderly and disabled Americans.<br />Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of lawmakers who have helped kick-start previous negotiations held an initial meeting last week on infrastructure, agreeing to meet again this week.</td>

      <td>Attorney general cites current concerns in speech on anniversary of 1995 attack</td>
      <td>The Justice Department is devoting more resources to preventing and prosecuting attacks by domestic extremists, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a speech commemorating the 26th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, one of the first major terrorism cases he oversaw as a senior department official in the 1990s.<br />The attack, which killed 168 people including 19 children, solidified for Mr. Garland the urgency and complexity of the domestic terror threat, he said, and now is driving him as the Justice Department combats a rise in extremist violence. Timothy McVeigh, an antigovernment extremist, was convicted in 1997 and executed in 2001 for using a massive truck bomb to level part of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995.<br />“Although many years have passed, the terror perpetrated by people like Timothy McVeigh is still with us,” Mr. Garland told victims’ families and law-enforcement officials gathered on Monday at a memorial to the victims in Oklahoma City, in his first major trip since taking office. “The Department of Justice is pouring its resources into stopping domestic violent extremists before they can attack, prosecuting those who do, and battling the spread of the kind of hate that leads to tragedies like the one we mark here today.”<br />Mr. Garland is a central figure in the Biden administration’s effort to combat domestic extremism following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob that law-enforcement officials have said included members of antigovernment and militia groups. A member of the right-wing Oath Keepers militia pleaded guilty on Friday to federal charges stemming from the riot, becoming the first among the more than 400 people facing such charges to formally admit to wrongdoing.<br />Echoing President Biden, Mr. Garland has said he views combating such violence as a priority. U.S. intelligence agencies warned Congress in March that domestic violent extremists pose a heightened security threat this year and that more violence is likely due to conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 election, the Covid-19 pandemic and Capitol breach. White supremacists and private militias pose the most lethal domestic threat to Americans, the report concluded.</td>

      <td>While U.S. softwood-lumber duties clearly have made it more expensive for Canadian lumber producers to ship across the border (“Why Are Home Prices Soaring?” Review & Outlook, April 8), Canadian imports have declined for a different reason. More than two billion board feet of sawmilling capacity in British Columbia have been shuttered since 2019 due to timber losses caused by insect infestation and wildfire. The region has lost 15% of its total output capacity.<br />This decline occurred while annual U.S. demand for lumber has increased by more than 2.5 billion board feet. Builders in the U.S. can’t buy enough lumber to meet demand, irrespective of the prevailing tariffs. As demand has outpaced supply, lumber prices have broken $1,000 per thousand board feet. Most Canadian mills can produce lumber profitably at $400 per thousand board feet or less. The addition of 9% tariffs wouldn’t prevent them from matching or beating any price a U.S. producer would seek.<br />Chung-Hong Fu<br />Timberland Investment Resources<br />Brookline, Mass.</td>

Already, some were turning away patients and running low on oxygen and other supplies.<br />“I don’t say that the system has collapsed, but it has reached its limits,” he said.<br />The latest wave of cases has risen much faster than the country’s monthslong surge last year, moving the country to the center of a pandemic that has killed at least three million people world-wide. India has reported more than 200,000 new daily infections for five days straight, with the number surpassing 270,000 on Monday.<br />On Monday, Delhi reported 25,463 infections in the past 24 hours, nearly three times its biggest daily tally of 8,500 cases during a November peak.</td>

Since the Atlanta shooting last month in which six women of Asian descent were among eight killed, many Asian professionals have talked at company town halls about their experiences of racism and what it means to be Asian in U.S. workplaces and society. Some have pushed for donations from their employers toward issues facing Asian communities, while others have simply called for Asians to be more visible in the workplace.<br />“When you’re sticking out like a sore thumb, you try harder to blend in,” says Mr. Lai, 44. “But this is a new generation, and we feel like we do have a right to be heard.”</td>

      <td>Midcentury road projects displaced blacks and whites alike. Tearing them down now won’t help.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration claims that its proposed $2 trillion infrastructure program would accomplish everything from expanding mass transit to launching an era of green energy. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has articulated another ambitious goal recently: reversing the “racist” history of America’s highway system.<br />“Black and brown neighborhoods have been disproportionately divided by highway projects or left isolated by the lack of adequate transit and transportation resources,” Mr. Buttigieg tweeted in December. In an interview earlier this month, he reiterated that “there is racism physically built into some of our highways” and said the infrastructure program includes money “specifically committed to reconnect some of the communities that were divided by these dollars.”<br />The average American might not think of highways as relics of Jim Crow. But some urban planners claim that building the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s evolved into a plot to segregate black neighborhoods. The point of running new highways, the theory goes, was providing middle-class whites with a path into suburbia. Academic literature is filled with studies with titles like “Segregation Along Highway Lines” and “White Men’s Roads Through Black Men’s Homes: Advancing Racial Equity Through Highway Reconstruction.”<br />Activists now argue it’s time to right those wrongs, including by dismantling roadways in the same way vandals have been pulling down Civil War monuments. “Want to tear down insidious monuments to racism and segregation? Bulldoze L.A. freeways,” a Los Angeles Times opinion piece argued last summer. In New Orleans, activists want to tear down a section of the Claiborne Highway that crosses the traditionally black Tremé neighborhood of New Orleans.<br />The Congress for the New Urbanism, a nonprofit, has a list of their top 10 “teardowns” in places from Dallas to Tampa, Fla., to Denver. Supporters point to several dismantled roads as models, including a Milwaukee project that eliminated a mile-long freeway spur 20 years ago. In Mr. Buttigieg, activists have a transportation secretary who seems willing to commit federal money to the effort.</td>

      <td>While an apprehensive nation awaits the outcome of a Minneapolis police officer’s murder trial, it’s possible that the administration of American justice could soon be characterized by what future historians may come to call the Chelsea Handler standard.<br />As the trial of Derek Chauvin got underway a month ago, Ms. Handler, who has a day-job as a comedian but has branched out recently into the field of jurisprudence, issued a profound observation on  Twitter : “So pathetic that there’s a trial to prove that Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd when there is video of him doing so.”<br />You might think that more than 800 years after the Magna Carta and 230 years after the Bill of Rights, some notions of due process, presumption of innocence and protection against arbitrary justice might have embedded themselves in the minds of even our densest celebrities.<br />But while it’s easy to mock, we should be careful not to assume that this taste for summary conviction on the basis of popular sentiment is confined to unfunny comedians. It seems to be widely shared among the ideologues who now control the Democratic Party, the media and cultural elites.<br />Rep. Maxine Waters of California, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, joined demonstrations this weekend in Minnesota. She told supporters that if the Chauvin trial verdict goes the wrong way, “we’ve got to not only stay in the street but we’ve got to fight for justice.”</td>

      <td>The world’s leading suppliers of semiconductors are pushing to overcome the prolonged chip shortage that has hampered production of everything from home appliances to PCs to autos.<br />Chip makers are trying to eke out more supply through changes to manufacturing processes and by opening up spare capacity to rivals, auditing customer orders to prevent hoarding and swapping over production lines. The bad news is, there are no quick fixes, and shortages will likely continue into next year, according to the industry’s executives.<br />On top of a spike in demand, producers have been hamstrung by a series of freak events that have knocked out supply, while ongoing U.S.-China political frictions and concerns of a prolonged shortage have prompted some manufacturers to stockpile chips.<br />The current shortfall includes the less-advanced chips that the industry’s biggest players have been pulling away from to pursue higher-margin, cutting-edge chips. Building new production capacity usually takes years.<br />That could slow down the post-pandemic recovery for certain industries that use the chips that are looking to take advantage of rising consumer spending. It also feeds into inflation concerns as higher chip costs can stoke prices throughout the economy.</td>

      <td>With Covid-19 cases surging in some huge markets, Coca-Cola is right to be cautious about continued sales recovery</td>
      <td>Coca-Cola  on Monday threw a cold bottle of Dasani water on multinationals’ hopes for a rapid global recovery.<br />The beverage company reported decent quarterly earnings, saying organic revenue that strips out currency moves and portfolio changes rose 6% from a year earlier in the quarter ended April 2. However, this was against a miserable quarter in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic was spreading from Asia and Europe to the U.S. The resulting lockdowns have been punishing for Coca-Cola as they continue to curtail out-of-home sales in places such as restaurants and sporting venues.<br />Global unit case volumes in March of this year finally caught up with the same month in the pre-Covid-19 era of 2019, the company said. For all of 2021, the company left its prior forecast unchanged for high-single-digit organic revenue growth. Yet Chief Executive James Quincey warned analysts on a conference call Monday not to expect a straight-line recovery from this point, noting that confirmed Covid-19 cases globally hit a high last week.<br />While some countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. are making rapid progress on vaccinations and beginning to reopen, Mr. Quincey said, “you’ve got countries that are going in the exact opposite direction with cases shooting up and more levels of lockdowns.”<br />Mr. Quincey didn’t name any specific countries, but cases are surging in huge markets including Brazil and India. And the worries aren’t confined to the developing world: The governors of two major Japanese cities, Tokyo and Osaka, both have said in recent days that they are considering declaring new states of emergency due to the spread of virus variants.</td>

Meituan declined to comment.<br />The huge capital-raising is considerably bigger than the $4.2 billion Meituan raised in its 2018 initial public offering and suggests there is still a healthy appetite among investors for stock in Chinese technology companies, even though shares in Meituan and many peers have pulled back recently.<br />Earlier this month,  Prosus  NV raised $14.6 billion by selling down a small part of its stake in  Tencent Holdings Ltd. , the internet and videogaming giant.</td>

The union cited meetings that the company held with workers and a mailbox installed outside of the warehouse. More than 70% of workers who cast ballots in the election voted against joining the RWDSU.<br />The union alleges that Amazon, through company representatives, threatened employees with the loss of jobs or closing of the warehouse as well as possible loss of compensation and benefits, if the union were approved. The union also accused the company of targeting workers who asked questions at meetings by removing them from the gatherings, potentially scaring other employees.<br />The union’s complaint also focused on a mailbox, installed by the U.S. Postal Service at Amazon’s request outside the Bessemer, Ala., warehouse where the election was taking place. The union alleged that the mailbox could have coerced workers into incorrectly believing Amazon was conducting the election and thereby feeling compelled to vote against unionizing. The filing also accuses Amazon of electioneering by displaying a company campaign message near the mailbox.<br />“Amazon knew full well that unless they did everything they possibly could, even illegal activity, their workers would have continued supporting the union,” RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum has said. “We demand a comprehensive investigation over Amazon’s behavior in corrupting this election.”</td>

The activist had also consented to being prescribed “vitamin therapy,” they added, without detailing the nature of such treatment.<br />Mr. Navalny has been on hunger strike for about three weeks over what he has called poor treatment since he was incarcerated in February. He has accused authorities of lack of medical attention for what he described as debilitating back pain and numbness in his legs and one hand.</td>

That philosophy led to those designs being incorporated in more than 95% of the world’s smartphones.<br />British Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden on Monday asked the country’s antitrust agency to investigate the merger’s national-security implications and deliver a report by July 30. The digital secretary can clear the deal with or without conditions, or nix it.<br />The national-security review comes on top of the agency’s previously announced plans to probe the deal on antitrust grounds.</td>

Officials at some other transit systems around the U.S. said they have noticed an increase in quality-of-life concerns, including harassment, following a rise in those who are homeless seeking shelter on buses and trains.<br />Ms. Leibowitz, who is 48 years old, used to think nothing of taking the subway, day or night. She last dashed for a nighttime train at Prince Street in Manhattan in December, only to find herself alone in an empty car at 8 p.m.<br />She said she wondered what she would do if someone entered from an adjoining car and demanded money or her phone while she was trapped in a moving subway car. When she disembarked two stops later at Union Square, her heart was racing. “I have never felt that unsafe in my entire life,” she said.<br />MTA officials said riders’ fears are well founded. Instances of some serious crimes, such as robbery and felony assault, didn’t decrease last year even as ridership plummeted, they said. According to MTA data, felonies and misdemeanors per million riders were higher during the first quarter of 2021 than in 2017, 2018 and 2019.</td>

Interpersonal relationships are what fascinate her the most, and she describes herself as the ballast in her friend group whom others turn to when in need of support. “I’ve even had people assigned to me from other friends going, Please, Chelsea, can you please talk to this woman?” she says. “But right now I’m not taking on any new clients because of my podcast.”<br />Handler rose to fame in the mid-2000s hosting The Chelsea Handler Show, a sketch comedy series, and Chelsea Lately, a half-hour late-night comedy show, both on E!

It’s Me, Chelsea (which was turned into an NBC sitcom, Are You There, Chelsea?, in which she played the character of her sister) and My Horizontal Life: A Collection of One-Night Stands, a true-life story collection. In 2014, she signed a deal with Netflix to host a talk show, Chelsea, as well as reality-style documentaries. The talk show was canceled after two seasons and in 2018 Handler signed a first-look deal with NBCUniversal.<br />Last fall, HBO Max released Chelsea Handler: Evolution, Handler’s first stand-up special in six years, which she filmed during the pandemic. In it, she dives into more vulnerable material than usual. She shares the story of how her psychiatrist taught her how to develop a sense of empathy and how she continues to process the death of her brother, which happened when she was 9 years old. She also explored the experiences in her latest book, the 2019 memoir, Life Will Be the Death of Me…And You Too!<br />Here, she talks to WSJ. about the 21-day meditation challenge she’s been doing and learning how to say no.</td>

When the Journal visited the Tesla stand later on Monday morning, the company had beefed up security.<br />The protest at the Tesla booth, a rare public display of defiance in China, was picked up by state media outlets and quickly went viral on the Chinese internet. Within a few hours, more than 150 million people had viewed a hashtag of the incident on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform, remarking on how Tesla’s booth had become “a platform for rights defenders.”<br />Many users sympathized with her plight, with one accusing Tesla of “hoodwinking Chinese consumers” and others calling on the public to turn to Chinese competitors. Another user with more than 5 million followers who claims to have purchased three Tesla vehicles said in another widely liked post that he never had any problems with the braking system but offered up his own litany of complaints about other alleged glitches.</td>

Chris Vogelzang was an ABN Amro board member before Danske hired him in 2019. He held various positions at ABN Amro from 2000 to 2017, including as head of global retail and private banking.<br />In stepping down from Danske Bank, Mr. Vogelzang said he didn’t want speculation about his role at ABN Amro to get in the way of the Danish bank’s cleanup. Danske hired him following a massive money-laundering scandal of its own, disclosing in 2018 that its tiny Estonian branch had moved more than $230 billion from Russia and other former Soviet states over several years, undetected.<br />“I left ABN Amro more than four years ago and am comfortable with the fact that I managed my management responsibilities with integrity and dedication,” Mr. Vogelzang said.</td>

      <td>It is shaping up to be a stellar earnings season for stocks, particularly cyclical ones like banks and retailers. The problem is that the market may already be moving on.<br />Because the U.S. economy is emerging from the Covid-19 crisis, most analysts thought first-quarter numbers would be good. So far, they have been much better than good: By the end of Friday, S&P 500 companies that had already reported had beaten profit expectations by a combined 30%, according to FactSet, compared with a five-year average of 7%.<br />Were the earnings season to maintain this trend, it would be the highest number on record. The largest surprises have come from Wall Street’s big banks, which are the first blue chips to report— Morgan Stanley  shrugged off a $911 million loss from the Archegos implosion—as well as consumer-goods firms like  Lennar .<br />Optimism is reinforced by the latest economic data. In the U.S., retail sales for March were the strongest in 10 months. Even in Europe, where there has been less fiscal support for the economy, figures are coming in strong. This bodes well for the earnings season there as well.<br />But something strange is happening: While stocks are up across the board, those sectors beating expectations the most aren’t doing particularly well. The most glaring example is the KBW Bank Index, which actually fell last week.</td>

      <td>The war inside international soccer exploded into the open on Monday as the breakaway Super League led by 12 of the most powerful clubs in the game took legal action to protect its teams from being banned by the game’s established, but shell-shocked, governing bodies.<br />UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, had already threatened to suspend teams participating in the Super League, which hopes to begin play in 2022, from its competitions such as the Champions League. On Monday, it amplified the threat by saying that any player participating in the Super League would be excluded from the World Cup and the European Championships.<br />“This idea is a spit in the face of all football lovers,” UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said of the Super League proposal, which he called “a closed shop run by a greedy, select few.”<br />The wealthy clubs—including six in the English Premier League and top teams in Spain and Italy— had announced late Sunday that they intended to form a new pan-European competition for themselves and a few other teams. The move would further enrich those clubs and badly undercut the lucrative Champions League competition that is controlled by UEFA.<br />In a letter received by UEFA and FIFA, soccer’s world governing body, an unnamed representative of the Super League said that it had taken legal “protective steps” in response to threats that its clubs would soon be banned from domestic and international competition such as the Premier League and Champions League. The group did not specify where it had taken those steps.</td>

      <td>Financial industry pioneer Richard Sandor is ramping up his efforts to compete in the race to replace the London interbank offered rate, which helps set borrowing costs on everything from mortgages to business loans.<br />Mr. Sandor—who helped create interest-rate futures in the 1970s and launched his own replacement for the scandal-marred short-term interest-rate benchmark in 2019—is expanding offerings to include one-month and three-month borrowing rates. Ameribor is set on the American Financial Exchange, which was founded by Mr. Sandor and is where banks lend to each other through mutual lines of credit. Some small and medium-size lenders favor Ameribor because it changes with their funding costs.<br />The benchmark poses a challenge to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, the Libor alternative preferred by many Wall Street banks and regulators and which currently only offers an overnight rate. Major U.S. corporations and regional banks have been clamoring for longer-term rates before they choose a new benchmark.<br />Linked over decades to trillions of dollars of financial products such as mortgages and corporate loans, Libor is slated for replacement by the end of 2021. Finding a substitute poses a major challenge for the financial industry. Banks and companies want a reference rate that reflects the risks from short-term lending, supported by a market that behaves in a predictable manner, to ensure that loans are affordable for borrowers and profitable for lenders.<br />The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of large banks and investment firms convened by the Federal Reserve to find a substitute, selected SOFR in 2017. But corporations and banks have been slow to switch.</td>

      <td>Diplomatic campaign in response to alleged cyberattacks and election interference is raising borrowing costs for Russian government</td>
      <td>Russia’s markets reacted modestly to U.S. sanctions last week, but the country’s bonds have been weakening for months, indicating that for investors, geopolitical pressure is outweighing the country’s economic strength.<br />The sanctions announced April 15 bars U.S. banks and institutional investors from buying new Russian government ruble-denominated bonds at auction. The response to Russia’s alleged cyberattacks and election interference is part of a broader strategy by the Biden administration to pressure Russia financially. The U.S. in March released an intelligence report on the alleged election meddling and has stepped up trade sanctions for Russia’s alleged use of chemical weapons.<br />The new measures stopped short of prohibiting purchases of Russian government bonds in the open market, a step investors and analysts said would have had a much greater chilling effect. Still, the diplomatic campaign has coincided with an increase in Russian bond yields and a relatively modest decline in the ruble, boosting the Russian government’s funding costs.<br />The deterioration of Russia’s bonds and its currency bucked the expectations of some Wall Street banks, which had predicted that Russia’s strong balance sheet would help it outperform other emerging-market countries in 2021. Russia had low net debt relative to its gross domestic product, according to data from S&P Global Ratings, and analysts took comfort in the government’s commitment to conservative fiscal policy.<br />“The only reason any of the bonds trade with a risk premium is because of the risk of sanctions and the possibility they’ll escalate from here,” said Grant Webster, a portfolio manager who helps invest about $4.5 billion in emerging-market debt at  Ninety One PLC .  One of the mutual funds Mr. Webster co-manages reduced its allocation to Russian government bonds to 3.65% in February from 4.54% in January, according to data from  Morningstar Inc.</td>

      <td>With the pandemic keeping people hunkered down at home, doctors are seeing injuries related to renovation projects, imperfect work set-ups and exercise.</td>
      <td>For more than a year, some of us have been working in makeshift offices, hunched over computers on beds, floors or coffee tables. Stuck at home, we’ve taken on projects and have been climbing ladders, painting walls and using tools that once collected dust in the basement. Some of us stopped exercising entirely—or launched into fitness routines without proper preparation.<br />The result, doctors say, is more injuries among people hunkered down during the pandemic. “I’ve seen neck strains, rotator cuff injuries, low-back strains,” says Carlo Milani, a physiatrist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. That’s not all. Dr. Milani also is seeing “lumbar disc injuries, cervical spine disc injuries, pinched nerves in the neck, pinched nerves in the lower back.”<br />A November study in the journal Injury Epidemiology found that 26% of roughly 2,000 respondents reported a household injury between March and June 2020. That contrasts with a 2017 national survey in which 14% of people reported one in the three months before the survey, says Andrea C. Gielen, a professor in the Johns Hopkins Center for Injury Research and Policy and first author of the study. “That’s a big difference,” Dr. Gielen says. “More than a quarter of households experienced an injury.”<br />Falls were the most common, she says, making up 32% of injuries at home. Others include swallowing medications or household products, being scalded or burned, and being cut by something sharp or from running into something or someone.<br />Here, doctors weigh in on heading off common home injuries.</td>

      <td>Industry should be in a strong position long after the worst of the pandemic is over</td>
      <td>The business of healthcare looks as strong as ever. But lately, health stocks are a very different story.<br />Through Thursday, health stocks have returned about 7% so far this year. That lags behind the S&P 500 by about 5 percentage points. A broad index of small biotechnology shares is down so far this year, as other similarly speculative assets have surged. That underperformance belies the reality that the health economy, which accounts for nearly 18% of gross domestic product, is largely back to normal after a year of pandemic-driven disruption.<br />The first-quarter earnings season is off to a strong start.  UnitedHealth Group ,  the largest publicly traded U.S. insurer and an industry bellwether, said Thursday that revenue grew 9% from a year earlier in the first quarter and increased its 2021 earnings forecast. The company now expects to earn between $18.10 and $18.60 a share on an adjusted basis this year, good for roughly 9% growth from 2020. That forecast includes a pandemic-related hit to earnings of about $1.80 a share, resulting from factors such as extra Covid-19 testing and treatment costs, higher unemployment and the impact to patients of having deferred routine care in 2020.<br />Deal activity is still fairly strong: Life-science supplier  Thermo Fisher Scientific  announced last week a deal to purchase the pharmaceutical-testing company  PPD  for $17.4 billion in cash and stock, a roughly 24% premium. U.S. regulators gave the green light to drugmaker  AstraZeneca ’s  planned acquisition of  Alexion Pharmaceuticals ,  which was earlier than investors had expected. Alexion shares shot higher in response.<br />Healthcare investors should always be wary of changes to regulations governing insurance coverage, drug pricing and other key business factors. There is some uncertainty there—for instance, the Biden administration has yet to nominate a permanent commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Still, any wholesale change to the status quo seems unlikely in the near term, as the administration has focused on other priorities. Meanwhile, long-run industry tailwinds, such as an aging population, remain intact.</td>

Money managers are looking to gauge whether stocks’ high valuations are justified after the Dow and S&P 500 hit closing records last week.<br />“After a big move, you get a pause of breath and a bit of a reassessment,” said Caroline Simmons, U.K. chief investment officer at UBS Asset Management. “People are reassessing, waiting for newsflow that might indicate that growth and inflation remain on track.”<br />U.S. health authorities decided to recommend pausing the use of the  Johnson & Johnson  vaccine due to concerns about improper treatment of blood clots, The Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend.

It has sought permission for another 30,000.<br />Now, rival companies such as  Viasat Inc.,  OneWeb Global Ltd., Hughes Network Systems and Boeing Co. are challenging Starlink’s space race in front of regulators in the U.S. and Europe. Some complain that Mr. Musk’s satellites are blocking their own devices’ signals and have physically endangered their fleets.<br />Mr. Musk’s endeavor is still in beta testing but it has already disrupted the industry, and even spurred the European Union to develop a rival space-based internet project to be unveiled by the end of the year.<br />The critics’ main argument is that Mr. Musk’s launch-first, upgrade-later principle, which made his  Tesla Inc.  electric car company a pioneer, gives priority to speed over quality, filling Earth’s already crowded orbit with satellites that may need fixing after they launch.</td>

Orocobre runs the Olaroz lithium operation in northern Argentina, while Galaxy runs the Mt. Cattlin mine in Australia and has projects under development in Argentina and Canada.<br />Based on the companies’ closing share prices on Friday, a combined company would have a market value of 3.96 billion Australian dollars, equivalent to $3.06 billion.

      <td>As the pandemic’s weight shifts to the developing world, a huge gap in vaccinations is opening with rich nations</td>
      <td>Efforts to vaccinate the poorest countries against Covid-19 have slowed to a trickle, leaving many with weakened defenses against the coronavirus just as the weight of the pandemic shifts from developed to developing nations.<br />An initiative backed by the World Health Organization and rich countries to supply free vaccines to 92 low- and middle-income countries recently slashed the number of shots it plans to ship by the end of May. That initiative, called Covax, will deliver 145 million doses instead of about 240 million because India, its main supplier, has largely stopped exporting shots as it fights a surge in cases at home.<br />That is widening an already huge vaccination gap between rich and poor countries. While more than 200 million doses have been administered in the U.S., Covax has so far supplied fewer than 41 million of its planned two billion doses by the end of 2021.<br />Slow uptake of Covid-19 vaccines in developing countries could create problems for the rest of the world. Epidemiologists believe that failure to vaccinate much of the developing world could leave a large reservoir of the coronavirus circulating, giving it the chance to mutate and possibly spill over to developed countries.<br />Most of the Covax shots planned for the first half of the year were to be manufactured by the world’s biggest vaccine maker, the Serum Institute of India, which has partnered with  AstraZeneca  PLC to make the vaccine the company developed with the University of Oxford. The SII says its output has also been constrained by limits imposed by the U.S. on the export of key raw materials for vaccines, an attempt by Washington to speed up manufacturing at home.</td>

Some market participants said a further rally would require more clarity on Huarong’s financial health and any potential restructuring.<br />The bonds had tumbled after Huarong unexpectedly missed an end-March deadline to release its 2020 financial results, pending what it called a “relevant transaction,” and with little more information from Huarong or Chinese authorities. Investment-grade offshore bonds from other Chinese companies had also come under pressure.<br />On Friday, Chinese regulators broke their earlier silence, in a statement that investors said was positive because it showed authorities were engaged with the issues, even if it was brief and broad.<br />“From the current situation, the operation of several financial asset-management companies is stable, the main operating indicators, regulatory indicators are in a reasonable range.

      <td>New payment methods won’t transform a currency that foreigners don’t want to hold into one that they do</td>
      <td>Excitable commentators who say China’s digital yuan is a threat to the dollar should take the word of Chinese central bank deputy governor Li Bo, who said on Sunday that the country’s digital yuan isn’t an effort to displace the greenback.<br />The yuan’s digitization is fascinating in terms of its political implications and regarding the new economic levers it might give the government domestically. But it offers relatively little as a tool to boost the yuan’s limp international presence, let alone as a weapon to challenge the dollar’s supremacy.<br />As the currency of the world’s largest trading economy, the yuan punches far below its weight. According to an International Monetary Fund study published in 2019, data from 2016 suggests that around 93% of China’s exports and 95% of its imports were denominated in dollars.<br />Not much seems to have changed. In February the yuan’s share of global payments was 2.2%, compared with February 2016’s 2.45%, according to data from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Even that overstates its international use: A consistent three-quarters of its total global payments are conducted in Hong Kong.<br />Speaking to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission last week, Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that he has yet to see a convincing argument of how digitization really promotes global use.</td>

Executives say the service could become a new source of income when the industry is grappling with how to adapt to a lower-carbon economy.<br />Oil companies have long captured carbon from their operations, albeit mostly to produce more oil. Now they want to retool that skill as a service they can sell to heavy-polluting industries like cement and steel, burying their carbon in the ground indefinitely for a fee, rather than releasing it into the atmosphere. Yet critics question the environmental benefits and high cost of such projects.<br />Last month, Shell,  Total SE  and  Equinor AS A launched a joint venture to store carbon in a rock formation thousands of feet beneath the seabed off the coast of Norway. The state-backed Northern Lights project is set to be the first time companies outside the oil industry will be able to pay to have their carbon gathered and stored.<br />Exxon has said it plans to form a new business unit to commercialize carbon capture and storage, forecasting it could become a $2 trillion market by 2040.  Chevron Corp.  has formed partnerships on storage projects, while  BP  PLC is codeveloping storage projects in the U.K. and Australia.</td>

The emphasis on women’s role in educating children and caring for the elderly comes as birth and marriage rates drop, trends that may have dire economic consequences.<br />In the early years of Communist rule, Mao Zedong urged women to join the workforce to help build the nation and to hold off on marrying and having children. Later came edicts that couples could have only one child to avoid runaway population growth.<br />During Mr. Xi’s time in power, new party slogans emphasizing “family, family education and family virtues” or “pass on the red gene” have been coupled with efforts to censor voices on women’s rights.<br />In recent days, more than a dozen accounts used by women’s-rights groups were deleted from the Weibo social-media platform as well as cultural-discussion site Douban.com.</td>

      <td>Mail and absentee voting is the top issue among election-related bills filed by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers across the country, a Wall Street Journal analysis of nearly 1,800 bills found. It is also the top issue in states with single-party control, where passing legislation could be easier. Early in-person voting has also garnered attention, and proposed changes to voter registration, to election-day voting procedures and to the authority of state and local election officials have been prolific.<br />The Journal’s finding underscores how mail and early voting have become partisan flashpoints after the 2020 election, when more than 108 million people chose to vote before Election Day either through the mail or in person, according to state data compiled by the Associated Press.<br />Then-President Donald Trump spoke repeatedly against expanding mail-in voting during the election, a view now shared by many Republican voters. President Biden’s campaign and many Democratic leaders embraced the shift to mail and early voting during the pandemic, a strategy that led to mail ballots being overwhelmingly Democratic in several states.<br />That partisan pattern has carried through to state legislatures this year, the Journal found. Some Democratic lawmakers have proposed bills that would lock in changes made during the pandemic to make it easier to cast a ballot by mail or early in person. Republicans have sought to pare back some of the pandemic-year changes, including by requiring more verification of a voter’s identity when mailing in a ballot and curtailing a practice in some places in which election officials automatically mail out ballot applications to all voters.<br />In the 2020 election, about two-thirds of voters nationally who cast ballots by mail voted for President Biden, while the opposite was true of Election Day voters, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of 110,000 voters conducted in the days leading up to and on Election Day. Nationally, Mr. Trump edged out Mr. Biden among early in-person voters 51% to 48%, the survey found.</td>

      <td>A huge run-up in foreign holdings of Chinese government bonds has stalled, with international investors hitting pause on their purchases as China’s interest-rate advantage over the U.S. has shrunk.<br />International ownership of Chinese government debt declined slightly in March to the equivalent of $313 billion, according to the China Central Depository & Clearing Co. Holdings fell about 1% to 2.04 trillion yuan, from 2.06 trillion yuan a month earlier.<br />That was the first drop in foreign investors’ positions since February 2019. It came in a month when the yuan weakened more than 1% against the dollar, after strengthening more than 9% from June through February.<br />Meanwhile, prices for U.S. Treasury notes and other global government debt have been falling, pushing yields higher. That has shrunk the extra yield that China’s sovereign debt offers over international rivals.<br />This spread has narrowed to about 1.6 percentage points, after topping 2.2 percentage points throughout the second half of last year, data from FactSet and brokerage Tullett Prebon shows.</td>

Andrew Cuomo shouldn’t resign amid sexual-harassment allegations, but a growing number of voters view him unfavorably and don’t want him to seek re-election, a poll released Monday found.<br />Fifty-one percent of the 801 voters surveyed last week by the Siena College Research Institute said the Democratic governor shouldn’t resign, while 37% of the voters said he should. Even so, dozens of federal and state officials, including Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have called for him to step down.<br />The level of support for Mr. Cuomo to stay in office was highest among Black voters and voters over 55 years old, the poll showed. A Siena poll released on March 15 showed that 35% of voters thought the governor should resign and 50% didn’t.<br />But 57% of voters surveyed said they would prefer to vote for someone else in next year’s gubernatorial race, compared with 33% who said they would vote to re-elect Mr. Cuomo. The governor had previously said he was planning to run for a fourth term.<br />Five current and former aides to Mr. Cuomo have accused him of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior in the workplace. The governor has denied allegations of inappropriate touching and apologized if his workplace behavior offended anyone. He has asked New Yorkers to withhold judgment before an independent review overseen by Attorney General Letitia James is completed.</td>

Your guess is as good as mine.<br />Gossip, the thread of whispered conversation and conjecture that once flowed through the workplace, has dwindled in our new network of home offices and half-empty headquarters. Detached from many of our work friends, forced to type out most of our thoughts, we’re finding that gossiping feels risky, weird and hard.<br />Serendipitous run-ins with colleagues from other departments by the coffee machine—Did you hear what happened in sales? Did you know she’s leaving?—have been replaced by formal Zooms with little time for chitchat. Hybrid work schedules mean even when we’re in the office, many others aren’t. Stuck on calls with the same five teammates, sometimes it feels like there’s simply no new information to be had.<br />“We already know what everybody has to say,” says Joe Labianca, a management professor at the University of Kentucky’s Gatton College of Business and Economics.<br />The rosy and righteous among us might say good riddance. And surely at some employers there’s now less drama, and more time for whatever we were hired to do. But there’s a lot we miss. In a recent survey of 504 employees and business owners by law firm Seyfarth Shaw, the top thing people reported longing for after a year of remote work was “in-person and ‘grown-up’ workplace conversations.”</td>

Andrew Cuomo in next year’s statewide elections, adding he hopes for a consensus about his party’s candidates before year’s end.<br />“It is imperative that we get the ball rolling,” said Mr. Langworthy.<br />There are now more than twice as many Democrats in the state as Republicans, and the GOP hasn’t won a statewide office since Gov. George Pataki was elected to a third term in 2002. Republicans also lost control of the state Senate majority in 2018, hampering the state party’s efforts to raise campaign money.<br />U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, who represents a district in eastern Long Island, on April 8 became the first major GOP candidate to declare a gubernatorial bid. His campaign said he raised $1 million on its first day of operations. In January, Mr. Cuomo reported he had $16.8 million in his war chest.</td>

      <td>Raúl’s resignation as head of the ruling Communist Party changes nothing.</td>
      <td>Raúl Castro announced his resignation as chief of Cuba’s Communist Party on Friday. Many U.S. media outlets characterized the move as the “end of an era” of communist rule on the Caribbean island. This is false. For many years Cuba has not really operated as a communist or socialist state. Instead it has been ruled by a military dictatorship that concentrates its power within a cartel-like chain of command of hard-line Castro family members and loyalists and generals who fiercely shield their wealth and status—as well as each other.<br />Many analysts are focused on whether Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel will inherit Mr. Castro’s leadership position as party secretary, which—on paper, at least—is the highest office in the land. This is a distraction, as is Mr. Díaz-Canel, who was installed by Mr. Castro in 2018 as part of a faux transition of power. In Cuba, the Castro family leads with an iron fist, and the party and government follow suit. Even the Communist Party’s online motto, #SomosContinuidad—“we are continuity”—implies the regime is determined not to change.<br />The key figure of Cuba’s silent elite is Gen. Luis López Callejas, Mr. Castro’s former son-in-law and the father of his grandchildren. Mr. López Callejas leads Gaesa, a military-run conglomerate that controls about 75% of the Cuban economy, including hotels, construction companies, shipping companies, hard-currency transmitters and currency exchanges. In 2018, a former State Department official told a Senate subcommittee that Cuban military personnel under Mr. López Callejas’s command were “directly involved” in trafficking cocaine from Venezuela.<br />Another key figure is Mr. Castro’s son, Col. Alejandro Castro Espín, a powerful member of the Cuban intelligence apparatus. He maintains a close relationship with the Kremlin and was directing Cuba’s spy agencies at the time of the 2019 sonic attacks against U.S. and Canadian diplomats in Cuba, which are still unexplained.<br />These Castro family members and loyalists like José Machado Ventura, Ramiro Valdés and other Cuban military officials whose names most Americans have never heard are the real rulers of Cuba.</td>

      <td>Keynesians have it backward: Growth is driven by production, not consumption.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan has many economists excited for a return of old-school Keynesian splurging. “Fiscal policy is back,” Nobel laureate Joe Stiglitz cheered. “That will create more demand and that should give people more confidence to invest.” But economic growth—which even Mr. Stiglitz would likely agree is the best way to fight poverty—comes down to supply, not demand. And the Biden plan could stifle the innovation that drives it.<br />Whether public or private, spending doesn’t cause growth. Mr. Stiglitz and his allies have it backward: Consumption is downstream from production. Growth is about increasing the supply of goods over time; you can’t spend if the goods haven’t been produced. Production grows as technology and production processes improve. Such improvement requires saving and investing rather than consuming.<br />The early details on Mr. Biden’s infrastructure plan aren’t promising in terms of incentives for saving and investment. The bill includes significant tax increases on corporations, which would also hurt households and investors. The president and his team deserve credit for attempting to pay for the plan. But raising taxes, especially on businesses, weakens incentives to invest. The result is lost growth.<br />Mr. Biden’s plan also largely directs resources away from uses that would increase productivity. Improvements in roads and bridges may boost how much companies can produce, and hence growth, by making it easier to move labor and goods across the nation. But that’s a minority of the bill’s spending; other expenditures will have the opposite effect. Take the proposal to invest in expanding clean energy and electric-vehicle charging stations. This is a rather elastic interpretation of infrastructure, and a wealth-wasting one besides.<br />The government is not good at picking investments. President Obama promised smart green projects. What we got was the Solyndra debacle, which consumed hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars while producing little of value. Those dollars are resources that could have been invested elsewhere. What Mr. Biden proposes amounts to a great many Solyndras. That’s an enormous amount of productive capital to squander.</td>

      <td>Yuri Gagarin, the ﬁrst man in space, held symbolic value for the Soviet Union, which claimed to offer a better system than the U.S.</td>
      <td>Readers of Stephen Walker’s fine new account of how Yuri Gagarin, a 27-year-old Soviet air-force major (he was promoted from lieutenant while circling the Earth), became the first man in space will discover quite a bit about Gagarin the man, but a great deal more about the program that put him into orbit 60 years ago, on April 12, 1961.<br />Vasco da Gama, Gagarin was not. For all his skill, toughness, unflappability and courage, he was no explorer. In a way, he was merely the most important of all the fauna that the Soviets shot into space. The first astronauts had relatively little control over their capsules; the first cosmonauts had far less.<br />Gagarin’s value was primarily symbolic. He was not only the embodiment of humanity’s scientific progress, but a living demonstration that the Soviets offered a better, faster path to the future than the U.S. His mission was to return alive, uninjured—and sane. To that end, during his training Gagarin, like other aspiring cosmonauts, was subjected to almost every brutality—physical and psychological—that his doctors could think up.<br />Like their American counterparts, the first Soviet spacemen had to be advertisements for the system in which they were raised, but more so. They had to fit, not just literally (Gagarin, at 5-foot-5, was two inches shorter than the maximum height allowed), but politically and personally. With his dazzling smile, charm, cheerfulness and peasant background, Gagarin was picked as the first to fly, over his friend Gherman Titov, who was more cerebral, more of a loner, more independent-minded, the son of a teacher. As Mr. Walker notes in “Beyond,” “Gagarin knew how to cast iron. Titov knew how to recite Pushkin,” a “suspiciously bourgeois” display of erudition. What’s more, “Gagarin had two healthy daughters. Titov’s only infant child had recently died and now he had no children, a bleak narrative for a would-be supreme representative of the Soviet state.”<br />That said, the runner-up was, on balance, the stronger character, and thus Titov, though only 25, was thought more suitable than Gagarin to cope with the next mission—17 orbits rather than one (Gagarin’s flight was over in under two hours, Titov’s took more than a day). This may, however, have been a lesser ordeal than the one that Mr. Walker describes well: Titov’s lifelong burden of only having been second into orbit, forever Buzz to Gagarin’s Neil.</td>

High-voltage batteries like the ones used in Teslas can reignite after being damaged, even after firefighters have extinguished a fire, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.<br />As of Sunday, authorities still were investigating whether the front passenger airbag deployed and whether the vehicle’s advanced driver-assistance system was enabled at the time of the crash.</td>

      <td>President Biden’s budget proposal includes record spending for nearly every corner of government, but there’s one big exception: national defense. Even as global threats rise, notably from China, Mr. Biden is squeezing the Pentagon.<br />Few in the media have noticed, but the White House is proposing a fiscal 2022 Pentagon budget of $715 billion. That’s a 1.6% increase from 2021’s $704 billion, but it’s a cut in the military’s spending power assuming likely inflation of more than 2%. Non-defense domestic discretionary spending will surge 16%, with the Education Department rising 41%, Health and Human Services 23% and the Environmental Protection Agency 21%.<br />With Mr. Biden proposing a separate $2.3 trillion for “infrastructure,” you’d think the Pentagon would be included. Aircraft and naval ships are certainly more justified as public works than subsidies to buy Teslas. Mr. Biden is making a conscious statement about his party’s political priorities: butter and more butter, but less for guns.<br />This marks a return to the downward defense spending trend of the Obama years. Defense spending as a share of GDP fell to 3.1% in fiscal 2017 from 4.7% in 2010, even as the military’s missions increased. Shrinking defense led to a readiness crisis that was showing up in more accidents and deficiencies in deployable ships and air units.<br />The Trump Administration and GOP Congress stopped the decline, and 2020’s defense outlays were estimated at 3.3% of GDP before the pandemic shock. But the Biden budget will again force risky trade-offs between military readiness and investment in the technology and weapons of the future.</td>

He dared to recover in Germany after nearly dying after he was poisoned by government agents. But he bravely returned to Russia, where he was arrested and imprisoned.<br />Mr. Navalny has been on a hunger strike after being denied treatment for other ailments. “Alexey is dying now. Given his condition, it’s a matter of days,” Mr. Navalny’s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on  Facebook .<br />The White House warned Sunday that there would be “consequences” if Mr. Navalny dies, and President Biden said Saturday that his treatment is “totally, totally unfair.” But Mr. Biden sent Mr. Putin mixed signals last week by inviting the autocrat he has called a “killer” for a leader-to-leader summit even as Mr. Navalny’s health was weakening in prison.<br />The free world—if we can still use that locution in the Age of Woke—needs to find its voice again on behalf of courageous dissenters like Alexei Navalny and Jimmy Lai. They should become global household names, as Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov were during the Cold War. And let’s hope the White House is serious about “consequences.”</td>

Police said that the killings were an isolated domestic-violence situation and that there was no risk to the general public. Police shut down a portion of Highway 360 and advised residents to shelter in place as they searched nearby areas for the suspect.<br />Paramedics responded just before noon to the shooting, which left two Hispanic women and a Black man dead, authorities said.

Its use could have worsened the patients’ condition, the people said.<br />That night, the country’s top health officials agreed during a one-hour Zoom meeting to take the strongest step: publicly recommend pausing the vaccine’s use while probing the adverse-event cases, the people said.<br />Since the announcement, the Food and Drug Administration has been studying other reports of additional blood-clotting cases among people who received J&J’s vaccine, but hasn’t confirmed whether any reflect the same phenomenon, the people said. Yet officials are growing more persuaded, the people added, that the six total cases reported so far are related to the shot.</td>

      <td>Amid chaos back home, he received ‘temporary’ U.S. status—in 2001.</td>
      <td>Jose Santos Sanchez and his wife came to the U.S. illegally in the late 1990s from El Salvador. After severe earthquakes shook their native country in 2001, the U.S. granted Temporary Protected Status to let them stay and work. Two decades later, they’d like to get out of immigration limbo, and on Monday the Supreme Court will hear their case (Sanchez v. Mayorkas).<br />Mr. Sanchez has worked as a mechanic for a yacht manufacturer in New Jersey. The couple’s youngest son was born in the U.S. and is an American citizen. In 2014 Mr. Sanchez applied for permanent residency, along with his wife. But the government said his illegal entry all those years back had made him ineligible, because he’d “never been admitted into the United States.”<br />That verdict was upheld by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, in a unanimous opinion by Judge Thomas Hardiman. The statute book says certain aliens can apply for residency, provided they were “inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States.” Although Temporary Protected Status allows Mr. Sanchez to stay lawfully in the U.S., it isn’t the same thing. “A grant of TPS does not constitute an admission,” the court said. “As its name suggests, this protection is meant to be temporary.”<br />This legal analysis is persuasive, unlike a contrary 2013 opinion from the Sixth Circuit. That ruling couldn’t stand to quote the U.S. Code without admonishing in a footnote “that using the term ‘alien’ to refer to other human beings is offensive and demeaning.” It leaned on a provision saying that “for purposes of adjustment of status,” a TPS recipient “shall be considered as being in, and maintaining, lawful status.”<br />In the Third Circuit’s view, this language only makes a difference for TPS recipients who came legally and can clear the first bar of having been admitted. Imagine, say, a Syrian who arrived with a student visa and got TPS when a civil war broke out at home. In his Supreme Court brief, Mr. Sanchez argues that dividing TPS recipients by the legality of initial entry “makes little sense” and creates “arbitrary” outcomes.</td>

      <td>Indianapolis prayer vigil remembers the eight victims of Thursday’s attack</td>
      <td>INDIANAPOLIS—The gunman in Thursday’s shooting here legally purchased two semiautomatic rifles after being detained by authorities and having one other gun confiscated, police said, as they try to determine the shooter’s motives.<br />Brandon Hole, a 19-year-old former employee of  FedEx Corp. , killed eight people and injured several others, before taking his own life at the company’s ground facility here Thursday night, police said. He had worked at the facility for two months, from August to October 2020, according to FedEx.<br />Police have identified those who died in the shooting as Matthew Alexander, 32 years old; Samaria Blackwell, 19; Amarjeet Kaur Johal, 66; Jasvinder Kaur, 50; Sardar Jaswinder Singh, 68; Amarjit Sekhon, 48; Karli Smith, 19; and John Weisert, 74.<br />The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives conducted a trace on the two weapons used in the attack and found Mr. Hole purchased the rifles legally in July and September 2020, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said on Twitter.<br />Mr. Hole was on the radar of local authorities as having mental-health issues and risk factors for violent behavior. In March 2020, his mother contacted law enforcement to report he might try to commit “suicide by cop,” according to Paul Keenan, the special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Indianapolis field office. Mr. Hole was temporarily committed at a local hospital for evaluation of his mental-health needs that month by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, and police seized a shotgun at his residence, Mr. Keenan said.</td>

      <td>The new administration has changed the U.S. tone on Russia, but that’s worth nothing without action.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration brought a dramatic change in America’s tone toward Russia and Vladimir Putin. In March President Biden bluntly and accurately called Mr. Putin “a killer,” indicating he saw no need to be diplomatic about the leader of a regime that has repeatedly attacked U.S. interests—and, as last week’s sanctions announcements made clear, the U.S. itself.<br />But tone doesn’t count for much unless it’s backed by consistent action, which had been lacking. Mr. Putin is no master strategist, but he reads people well and senses weakness with animal cunning. Mr. Biden has to walk the walk after talking so much talk, or Mr. Putin will assume that the new U.S. administration is as feckless as the previous two.<br />On April 13, Messrs. Biden and Putin spoke on the phone for the second time. The White House readout includes Russian hacking and election interference and is strong on Ukraine, where Mr. Putin is again amassing forces.<br />Then comes the final sentence, like the twist in a horror movie. “President Biden . . . proposed a summit meeting in a third country in the coming months.” A summit? With a killer? In one stroke, Mr. Biden gave Mr. Putin exactly what he craves, equal status with the president of the United States. Even if it never comes to pass, the invitation sends the message that Mr. Putin is irreplaceable, still worthy of the support of the oligarchs and elites whose fortunes he guarantees. President Trump was rightly lambasted for granting Mr. Putin the 2018 Helsinki summit, which did nothing for U.S. interests and a great deal for Mr. Putin’s. This would be no better. Calling it diplomacy ignores that diplomacy is supposed to have a point.<br />The ending of the readout was also notable for failing to mention Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose health was deteriorating even before he began a hunger strike to protest his treatment in prison.</td>

      <td>Clear lines of authority would make it easier to resolve the Johnson & Johnson complications.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration made a reasonable decision last week to pause the rollout of  Johnson & Johnson ’s  Covid vaccine while it investigates reports of rare blood clots. But it was a surprise, and the path forward is cloudy. Regulators need a clear process for evaluating issues that crop up, and the Food and Drug Administration should lead it.<br />All drugs and vaccines have rare side effects, not all of which can be ferreted out in clinical trials. The FDA collects safety information after approval and is charged with making decisions about how to balance the risks and benefits of medical products. This is an essential part of the drug-safety system, and so is the FDA’s authority to make adjustments to a product’s recommended use.<br />But now it isn’t clear who will have the final word. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been thrust into a new and challenging role of judging a safety question, as well as how and when the vaccine should be restored to use. The discomfort of the CDC’s advisers seemed evident at an emergency meeting convened last week. The panel adjourned without a decision.<br />We need a thorough, predictable process to assess emerging data on vaccines and advise doctors on their benefits and risks. That’s the FDA’s historical mandate. Putting the issue before the CDC confused the process and slowed the decision.<br />Covid vaccines are under especially intense scrutiny, but it isn’t uncommon for the FDA to recommend narrowing or suspending use while looking into a safety issue. Sometimes the risks turn out to be remote or can be mitigated by changing how the product is used. This dynamic review process allows regulators to take new information into account.</td>
