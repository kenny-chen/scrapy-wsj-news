      <td>South Korean auto maker’s proposal would involve a multibillion-dollar investment</td>
      <td>Kia Corp.  has approached potential partners about a plan to assemble Apple Inc.’s long-awaited electric car in Georgia, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The proposal would involve a multibillion-dollar investment, according to people familiar with the matter, who stress that a deal hasn’t been completed. If successful, it would thrust the iPhone maker into the car business after several years of secretive work in which its engineers plotted to upend the 100-plus-year-old automotive industry.<br />The likelihood of a final agreement was thrown into question when Kia’s parent company,  Hyundai Motor Group ,  said last month, then sought to play down, that it was in negotiations with Apple to cooperate on an electric driverless car. Apple has never confirmed those talks, and its dalliances with other auto makers in the past have fizzled.<br />Hyundai has talked to Apple about investing more than $3 billion in a deal that would see its subsidiary Kia begin building cars under the tech company’s brand as soon as 2024, a person familiar with the matter said. Under such an agreement, up to 100,000 vehicles could be assembled in the first year in Georgia, where Kia has a factory, the person said. South Korean newspaper Dong-A Ilbo earlier reported the potential deal’s scope.<br />As reports of a deal have filled the Korean media, Hyundai and Kia shares have soared. Recently, Hyundai-Kia officials have been reaching out to potential partners in preparation for a deal going through. “We are hearing encouraging things,” said a person briefed on the matter in Georgia.</td>

      <td>U.S. employers added 49,000 jobs last month, returning growth to the labor market after a one month dip, while the unemployment rate fell to 6.3%.<br />The small January gain came after payrolls fell steeply in December, the first decline since the coronavirus pandemic triggered business shutdowns last spring.<br />Jobs grew strongly in business and professional services, the Labor Department said in its January report on U.S. employment. Many sectors, though, lost jobs last month. The leisure and hospitality sector lost 61,000 jobs in January, following a steep decline of 536,000 in December. Retailers, health-care companies and warehouses cut jobs in January.<br />The fall in the unemployment rate in part reflected the Labor Department’s annual update to population estimates used to calculate the unemployment rate and other measures. The new estimates show the civilian labor force was 200,000 lower than previously estimated, employment was 180,000 less, and unemployment 20,000 less.<br />The broader economic recovery stalled significantly this winter. Unemployment claims, a proxy for layoffs, have remained above pre-pandemic levels. Consumers cut back on spending, as some were wary of leaving their homes as virus cases surged. Others wanted to shop and dine out, but had limited options.</td>

      <td>Pared-back collections of clothes and accessories are simplifying women’s lives and eliminating daily ‘what to wear?’ stress. Here, how to build your own.</td>
      <td>IF YOU’VE GOT a closet full of clothes and nothing to wear, consider the benefits of a capsule wardrobe. Worn in combos, these tightly edited, pragmatic assortments of clothes and accessories can create many fail-safe outfits. The strategy can liberate you from the oppression of wondering “What should I wear,” simplify life and free your mind to engage in more meaningful pursuits, such as rereading “To the Lighthouse” or taking that raku pottery workshop.<br />Factors from Covid-19’s confinement lifestyle to Marie-Kondo culture have all fed the popularity of capsule wardrobes over the past year. Aren’t we all on a quest for control? But the capsule wardrobe concept has been around for decades. The term even merits its own relatively concise Wikipedia page, which credits the invention to Susie Faux who, in the 1970s, founded a London boutique called Wardrobe. Donna Karan’s mid-80s version, Seven Easy Pieces, changed the game for “Working Girl”-era women. And women’s magazines have trafficked in variations on “Five Ways to Wear It” or “10 Wardrobe Staples” for years.<br />For some modern-day apostles, it’s about putting your closet on a fashion diet. You can approach this by adhering to a preferred color palette or eliminating all but go-to basics—but rules help. Back in 2010, Courtney Carver, a 51-year-old in Salt Lake City, Utah, created Project 333, a 3-month challenge that required her to refrain from shopping and whittle her wardrobe to 33 items (underwear, sleepwear and workout gear don’t count). The process was part of a life-simplifying journey that began when Ms. Carver was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Once a self-described “adder,” she used to shop weekly to boost her mood. “It was ‘If I get this thing, I’ll feel happier,” she said. “It was never about the item. It was escape.”<br />Lee Vosburgh, 33, a blogger who runs the website Style Bee, created the 10 x 10 Challenge in 2015 as an antidote to her own shopaholism. Her call-to-action: Restrict yourself to 10 items, and style them into 10 outfits over 10 days. For her part, Jennifer Alfano, 52, a former Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar editor who now runs TheFlairIndex.com, doesn’t adhere to any magic-number methodology. She advocates eliminating excess by making “a list of what you have, why you have it and why you should keep it.” Next, reduce your closet to “an ultimate packing list” to identify essentials. Early last year, Ms. Alfano undertook an epic purge, parting with 281 items including her Hermès Birkin bag, which had sat unused for years. Among the keepers: an Yves Saint Laurent pea coat, Céline by Phoebe Philo sweaters and Manolo Blahnik shoes. She suggests selling your castoffs on sites like TheRealReal or recycling them through the service TerraCycle.<br />Over a 30-year career in fashion, which included executive posts at Lane Crawford and Net-a-Porter, Sarah Rutson, 51, had accumulated a world-class wardrobe…full of redundancies. “Did I have 30 black jackets? Yes,” she said. Now based in Los Angeles and working with brands and startups, Ms. Rutson has sold around 50% of her clothing. Her current capsule comprises such sharp but comfortable pieces as Birkenstocks, leather pants, crisp cotton shirts and statement rings.</td>

Textbooks are being rewritten to be more patriotic to China, and some images likely to antagonize Beijing are being removed, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Education is identified in the security law as a key area where greater government oversight is needed—along with the media and the internet. State media ascribed considerable blame for 2019’s social unrest to the city’s liberal school system and teachers. Thousands of students were arrested during monthslong protests, while many more formed human chains and chanted protest slogans in school yards.<br />China’s push to bring up future generations as dutiful citizens, however, is stoking concern among many teachers, students and parents, some of whom say it undermines long-cherished  principles of critical thinking and uncensored debate. Opposition groups say the clampdown is part of Beijing’s broader effort to stifle dissent in the city that has seen dozens of democratic politicians arrested and street protests stamped out.</td>

He makes microscopic movements, seemingly with a sixth sense for pressure. Then he quickly unleashes the football.<br />Patrick Mahomes has become the greatest quarterback of the next generation by reinventing the precise art that Brady mastered. He throws on the run, goes off script and weaponizes the entire football field against the defense.<br />This Super Bowl between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs is a window into an evolution unfolding in the NFL. The most important position in football is transforming. And the two most transcendent players in the Super Bowl are at the beginning and end of it.<br />Tom Brady defined how to properly play quarterback. Mahomes revolutionized it. They’ve both won the Super Bowl because of that. On Sunday, they will play the same position on the same field in the same sport—and play it nothing like one another. They’re peers who aren’t peers.<br />“[Brady] probably is the standard by which young quarterbacks could judge themselves as far as a pocket passer is concerned,” said Tom House, who trains NFL quarterbacks including Brady. “Mahomes is the prototype of the new school quarterback, where they basically are runners who can pass—or passers who can run.”</td>

      <td>Connected fitness company scrambling to improve deliveries as recovery from pandemic may alter its value proposition</td>
      <td>Peloton Interactive ’s  high-quality problem is getting to be an expensive one.<br />The purveyor of connected spin bikes and treadmills reported predictably strong results for its fiscal second quarter on Thursday afternoon. Revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $1.06 billion, with connected fitness subscriptions surging 134% to about 1.7 million. And Peloton’s appeal doesn’t even fully rest on those willing to shell out top dollar for its gear: Paid digital subscriptions to the company’s vast offering of virtual workouts soared 472% to about 625,000.<br />But some of those metrics are rather backward looking. Because Peloton doesn’t recognize revenue on its gear until it is in customers’ hands, revenue and subscriptions tied to those products essentially reflect what the company was able to get to customers who were patient enough to wait out production constraints. They haven’t seemed to ease: Peloton’s website still shows eight to 10 weeks of wait time to fulfill orders, even as the company says it has significantly increased its manufacturing output.<br />This has tested the patience of customers, many of whom have taken to Facebook and other social outlets to complain about the delays. Peloton might be the most famous game in town, but there are other makers of connected bikes doing brisk business. Peloton also saw a sharp slowdown in the growth of customer deposits and deferred revenue during the December quarter, which could indicate slowing demand. The company insisted on its conference call that this isn’t the case and noted that its growing use of delayed payment options will result in “a dramatically lower level of customer deposits” going forward. Peloton’s share price fell more than 7% Thursday evening following the report, though the stock remains a pandemic standout with a 12-month gain of more than 370%.<br />Peloton is focused on shrinking its wait times, but it won’t be cheap. The company said Thursday it is now investing more than $100 million in expedited shipping to boost its delivery speed. It also said it is delaying the U.S. launch of its new treadmill from April to late May. It is still working to boost its manufacturing. Its $420 million acquisition of Precor, announced in December, was primarily meant to add domestic manufacturing capabilities to better serve North American customers. Precor’s North Carolina facilities are expected to be producing Peloton equipment by the end of this calendar year.</td>

      <td><br /><br />Boeing Co. ’s newest jetliner is becoming its latest big problem, stretching out development, racking up a huge charge and complicating the plane maker’s bid to navigate the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />When Boeing decided to build the 777X in 2013, engineers designed it for airlines wanting to connect the globe’s major cities and carry some 400 passengers more efficiently than any of its earlier widely used jets. As the latest version of Boeing’s long-range jetliner introduced in the 1990s, it features two giant, fuel-efficient engines and big wings that fold so they can pull up to airport gates.<br />Boeing’s bet is souring, however. Unlike with some of its other airplanes, Boeing’s recent 777X woes aren’t directly related to apparent design missteps or quality lapses. The plane’s troubles stem from the pandemic’s hit to international travel and broader market fallout, and a stiffer regulatory posture following Boeing’s missteps tied to a hazardous flight control system that led to two fatal crashes of its smaller 737 MAX jets.</td>

      <td>New Chief Executive Jim Farley wants to invest more aggressively in electric vehicles, but he still hasn’t fixed Ford’s combustion-engine business</td>
      <td>Ford  is embracing digital technology, and talking about it loudly, in an effort to catch up with both Tesla and General Motors. The new approach is boosting the stock, but rising expectations don’t come for free.<br />The big news in Ford’s fourth-quarter results, reported after the bell Thursday, was a massive acceleration in technology investments. Just over four months into the job, Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley pledged $22 billion through 2025 to electric vehicles and the digital technology involved in connecting them to the internet, as well as $7 billion to autonomous driving. This was after the company on Monday inked a far-reaching partnership with Google also centered on “connected” vehicles and the reams of data they will produce.<br />Mr. Farley promised more detail in the spring, but hinted that the company might invest in battery production, as GM has done through a partnership with South Korea’s  LG Chem .  The car industry is currently struggling to produce as many vehicles as it would like because of a global shortage of semiconductors; Ford “cannot afford” to face the same problems with batteries, Mr. Farley told analysts.<br />GM CEO Mary Barra shifted her primary focus from cost-cutting and efficiency to investment and growth last year—the same move Mr. Farley is now making. The difference is that GM had already tidied up its once-sprawling global empire and improved profitability before changing gears. After years of cost problems, Ford’s core U.S. business is still in the repair shop, raising the question of how it will fund technology investments of $29 billion—a sum equivalent to almost two-thirds of its market value.<br />The good news is that 2020 will almost certainly mark the trough for Ford’s profits, which have fallen for three consecutive years. The company has just started selling a new version of the F-150, its most important product, and a credible competitor to Tesla in the all-electric Mustang Mach-E. Later this year comes the much-anticipated new Bronco sport-utility vehicle. The company expects between $8 billion to $9 billion of adjusted operating profit in 2021, up from $2.8 billion last year, though its guidance excluded a potential hit of at least $1 billion from the current global chip shortage.</td>

      <td>Both companies reported blockbuster fourth quarters but Snap’s guidance fails to inspire</td>
      <td>Snapchat parent  Snap Inc.  and  Pinterest  have broadened their influence significantly over the past year, but only one can be 2021’s top socialite.<br />Both companies reported blockbuster fourth quarters on Thursday afternoon. Sales for Snap and Pinterest grew 62% and 76%, respectively, year-over-year, as advertisers saw particular value in investing in platforms relatively insulated from last year’s election controversy. That was well ahead of the 33% pace that  Facebook  announced last week, though from a much smaller base.<br />Pinterest and Snap have had blazing share price returns over the past 12 months, with both more than tripling, eclipsing Facebook and  Twitter .  Their outperformance reflects the market’s acknowledgment of the significant revenue potential coming in fields such as e-commerce through augmented reality and video—big pandemic winners. Both companies, for example, are leveraging the ability for users to “try on” customers’ products through AR technology. Those users are increasingly coming to both platforms with buying intent.<br />But that might be where the similarities end. As far as near-term risks go, Snap seems more exposed. Its Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen noted advertising declines in January after the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. (Pinterest didn’t.) He also noted the potential for decreased ad demand based on coming iOS changes that Facebook has also flagged. Snap’s updates spooked investors, driving its shares down more than 7% after hours even as Pinterest’s moved higher.<br />Going forward, advertisers certainly have more to consider than political and platform uncertainty. Snap and Pinterest have very different user bases, owning their respective niches while working to expand them. Snap continues to report reaching 90% of 13- to 24-year-olds and 75% of 13- to 34 year-olds in the U.S., noting Thursday that its sway among that demographic in many of its established markets continues to grow. Chief Executive Evan Spiegel also cited a 25% increase in viewership on its Discover platform among users over 35. Meanwhile, Pinterest has long said that it reaches most U.S. moms and that it has more recently reported making progress with younger users and men.</td>

Its role in the suddenly booming sector has been a bright spot as the bank took $1.3 billion in unexpected charges last year and weathered a spying scandal and high-profile company frauds.<br />Spearheading the blank-check business is head of SPACs Niron Stabinsky, who was hired in 2015 from Deutsche Bank AG. He and Credit Suisse have built relationships with some of the most prominent SPAC founders, including venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, veteran deal maker and Vegas Golden Knights owner Bill Foley, and real-estate investor Barry Sternlicht.

      <td>‘We are hoping the treatment will lighten the burden of hospitalizing patients with serious symptoms’</td>
      <td>SEOUL—Late last year, South Korea’s prime minister called a homegrown antibody treatment that was nearing completion “a ray of light,” while the chairman of the pharmaceutical firm that was developing it boasted the medication could make the country free of Covid-19 by the spring.<br />But on Friday, even as South Korea’s drug regulators granted fast-track approval to  Celltrion Inc.’s  monoclonal antibody treatment, hopes that it could be an immediate game-changer have diminished.<br />The introduction of the new treatment was met with skepticism as previously approved antibody drugs have had limited impacts on aiding recoveries from Covid-19 before vaccines become readily available.<br />“We are hoping the treatment will lighten the burden of hospitalizing patients with serious symptoms,” said Kim Gang-lip, the country’s top drug-approval official. “It’s difficult to say how much [the treatment] will help in containing a surge.”<br />Celltrion’s drug, dubbed Regkirona, is intended for use with patients who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 and relies on lab-engineered versions of antibodies that simulate the body’s natural immune response to viruses. The class of therapies attracted attention after former President Donald Trump said a monoclonal antibodies drug helped him achieve a speedy recovery.</td>

      <td>Elevation of cloud boss to CEO role won’t change dependence on core e-commerce business</td>
      <td>Amazon.com ’s  new boss may come from the cloud. But the executive who helped pioneer elastic computing won’t be getting away from selling books, sweatpants and talking speakers soon.<br />Amazon announced earlier this week that Andy Jassy, current chief executive of the company’s AWS cloud division, will be running the whole company by the third quarter of this year. Mr. Jassy will succeed founder Jeff Bezos, and thus will be only Amazon’s second CEO in its 26-year history. Mr. Jassy has big shoes to fill, given Amazon’s place as the world’s second-largest public company by annual revenue, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.<br />Mr. Jassy’s role with AWS spawned the predictable avalanche of interpretations that the cloud is now Amazon’s most important business. But the numbers suggest that won’t be the reality even in the foreseeable future. Consider that Amazon’s direct retail revenue from its online and physical stores, plus its third-party selling services, exceeded $294 billion last year—more than six times what AWS generated.<br />Now throw in Amazon’s subscription revenue—mostly comprising the fees Prime members pay to guarantee free and fast shipping—and Amazon’s retail revenue last year rises to $319.2 billion. Retail actually outgrew AWS last year by 8 percentage points, thanks in part to the surge in e-commerce brought on by the pandemic. But more-normal growth going forward won’t change that picture much. Even if Amazon’s retail business stopped growing completely, and AWS maintained its 30% rate from 2020, it would still take the cloud eight years to overtake retail.<br />The cloud will most certainly remain vital to Amazon—especially in fueling its growing bottom line. And Mr. Jassy’s success with the venture has well earned him a shot at the top job. AWS on its own would now rank as the ninth-largest tech company in the S&P 500 by annual revenue. But retail remains key to Amazon’s future; AWS actually started as the company renting out the technical capacity it had built to service its e-commerce business. The new boss of the Everything Store will need to prove as proficient as his predecessor at doing everything.</td>

      <td>SMIC expects revenue growth to fall to single digits this year after a 17% jump in the last quarter</td>
      <td>HONG KONG—China’s largest maker of computing chips said restrictions placed by the Trump administration would crimp its pace of growth, despite the booming demand for semiconductors creating a global shortage.<br />Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.  in its first earnings report since it was added to a U.S. export blacklist on Dec. 18 on Friday said its revenue rose 17% to $981 million in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. The Shanghai-based company said it expects growth in revenue to slow to single-digit percentage points in the coming year.<br />SMIC executives lamented that if it weren’t for the U.S. restrictions, the company could have better capitalized on the global chip shortage that has benefited other manufacturers.<br />“After 20 years of independent technology development, market expansion, capacity building and the talent training, the company could have seized this year’s rare market opportunity and achieved rapid growth,” said Haijun Zhao, the company’s co-chief executive. If not for the U.S. actions and other risks, “SMIC could have maintained last year’s rapid growth momentum,” he said.<br />SMIC is one of China’s champions in the chip sector, an area in which Beijing has prioritized greater self-sufficiency. U.S. officials targeted the state-backed company with a raft of actions during the waning months of the Trump administration, alleging links to the Chinese military. SMIC has repeatedly denied military links.</td>

      <td>U.S. tech war to dent the Chinese chip maker’s ambitions even as orders soar</td>
      <td>China’s leading domestic chip maker is getting lots of orders at the moment due to the global semiconductor shortage. The tech war with the U.S., however, will dent its ambitions.<br />Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.’s  revenue for the quarter ended December fell 9.4% from the previous quarter, but that was already better than expected given that the Chinese made-to-order chip maker is at the heart of the U.S.-China technology war. Demand for chips from its less advanced mature nodes was strong due to semiconductor shortages across the board.<br />But SMIC’s gross margin took a hit: It was 18% last quarter, down from 24.2% in the quarter before. The Trump administration’s salvo against Huawei Technologies meant SMIC wasn’t allowed to supply one of its major customers, especially with its more advanced technologies. The higher depreciation charges from its 14-nanometer plants likely took a toll too, according to Bernstein. Its most advanced nodes accounted for only 5% of revenue last quarter, compared with 14.6% in the previous quarter. SMIC’s Hong Kong-listed shares fell 10.6% Friday.<br />SMIC expects gross margin to be in the midteens this year and revenue to grow by a mid-to-high single digit percentage from last year. But since the company’s more mature nodes are already running at close to full capacity, its long-term growth will depend on whether it can build more capacity.<br />SMIC has budgeted $4.3 billion for capital spending this year to expand capacity, mostly for its more mature technologies. That is a drop from the $5.7 billion spent in 2020, which came after the company was forced to slash the target to $5.9 billion in November from $6.7 billion as the Trump administration placed export restrictions on the company in September that made it very difficult to source chip-making tools, especially for more advanced nodes. The U.S. government then formally put SMIC on the entity list in December. This year’s capital expenditure depends on how the Biden administration handles the technology war with China—it is possible that the U.S. government may allow the export of less sensitive technology to SMIC, but that isn’t a sure thing either.</td>

      <td>Investors’ love for Opendoor suggests it doesn’t matter if you win or lose in iBuying, but how you game the game</td>
      <td>Opendoor Technologies  appears to have solved the elusive iBuying equation, but the math is still a bit hazy.<br />Since competitor  Zillow  made its big push into iBuying in early 2019, investors have struggled to understand how such a capital intensive business so dependent on market fluctuations can reliably make money. They have good reason: In the most recent quarter reported, Zillow said it lost roughly $7,500 on average for each home it bought and subsequently sold after interest expense, despite the surge in overall real-estate prices last year. Zillow hasn’t yet shown profitability in its iBuying business on that basis in any quarter and losses seem to be accelerating.<br />But things appear different at Opendoor. The company made about $5,000 per home after interest expense in the first quarter of last year, according to a November analyst day presentation. And, unlike Zillow, its contribution margin increased significantly as the year progressed, rising from 1.9% in the first quarter to 4.8% in the third quarter. Dividing its contribution profit by the total number of homes it sold shows that Opendoor made an average of just under $13,000 per home in the third quarter after interest expense.<br />Could Opendoor really be nearly three times better at making money in iBuying than a company with roughly 10 years more experience in online real estate? Investors seem to think it has at least some advantage: Opendoor’s stock has soared 56% over the last three months, outperforming Zillow’s 48% gain.<br />But it seems hard to believe that, in the algorithmic-based business of iBuying, a more established company could get outplayed in the data game. A 2019 analysis done by Mike DelPrete, a scholar in residence on real-estate technology at the University of Colorado at Boulder, found both Opendoor and Zillow purchase homes for just over 1% less than the value of the home as determined by a real-estate title insurance company. Indeed, Zillow’s own analysis published last month showed it is offering within 0.09% of what a home goes on to sell for on the traditional market.</td>

      <td>One year after hosting the last major tennis tournament with thousands of real live fans, the Australian Open is set to present a truly shocking event in 2021: a major tennis tournament with a full house of real live fans.<br />Some 30,000 spectators a day are expected in Melbourne for what is turning into one of the most ambitious sporting events of the pandemic era. There have been weeks of charter flights, massive quarantines, and impromptu tune-up tournaments, all designed to deliver an approximation of the year’s first major.<br />And for the most part, it has worked. Despite complaints about cabin fever and the quality of room service, the sport’s superstars are all where they’re supposed to be and ready to play two weeks of tennis. Nine of the top 10 women in the world (plus Serena Williams) are due to play, along with nine of the top 10 men; only Roger Federer is out as he recovers from knee surgery.<br />But organizers are constantly reminded of how fragile the whole operation is. After a security guard at a tournament hotel tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, hundreds of players and staff were once again locked down pending negative tests. All of Thursday’s matches at Melbourne Park were suspended and the main tournament draw had to be delayed.<br />If the reaction seems extreme, it’s because the Australian state of Victoria has the virus under relative control—and it intends to keep it that way. Organizers insisted that it wouldn’t impact the tournament.</td>

      <td>Americans usually rush out to buy things after an economic slump, but this time around there could be a surge in demand for services</td>
      <td>Here’s some advice for life after the pandemic: Make that restaurant reservation way in advance, prepare to pay up for that flight, get used to watching your team from the cheap seats and show up even earlier to the movie.<br />The slump caused by Covid-19 was unlike any other because consumer spending on services, which usually holds up well during downturns, cratered, and remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels. When the crisis eases—something that will with hope begin happening later this year, as more people get vaccinated—the recovery could be impressive.<br />Figuring out just how sharp that rebound will be is a matter of guesswork. While the limited experience the U.S. has with declines in spending on services suggests any rebound will be modest, Americans’ hankering to make up for all things they have missed out during the pandemic—and the ample savings many of them now have—suggests otherwise. The country could be on the cusp of a rebound in demand for services that will be hard for it to meet.<br />Whatever the actual outcome is, it will set the course for the economy. Spending on services amounts to about half of U.S. gross domestic product, while more than four in five U.S. jobs are in the service sector.<br />Usually, recessions are driven by weakness in spending on goods—items that run the gamut from socks to SUVs. That is because, even though Americans spend far more on services than on goods, big-ticket items in particular are easier to forgo when trouble starts. This downturn has been different not just because spending on services fell, but because, other than a brief period of weakness last spring, consumer spending on goods flourished as Americans bought items such as cars and washing machines in response to the pandemic. In the fourth quarter Commerce Department figures show that inflation-adjusted spending on goods was up 7.2% from a year earlier while spending on services fell 6.8% over the same period.</td>

      <td>Tech giant cites boost in pretax profit as reason for higher tax expense</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON— Amazon.com Inc.,  the company frequently cited by Democrats in their calls to raise corporate taxes, saw its tax liability jump last year as it prospered during the pandemic. But the technology giant, and others like it, could face even higher tax bills under the Biden administration’s plan for a minimum tax rate on profitable corporations.<br />Amazon reported $1.8 billion in current U.S. tax liability for 2020, a departure from the tiny or negative tax costs it posted in prior years. The company said a surge in pretax income last year led to the sudden rise in its reported tax expense.<br />In public-policy debates, Amazon’s taxes have often been reduced to allegations that it pays nothing, and that has long been an oversimplification. Still, Democratic control of the House, Senate and White House could matter a lot for the company. If President Biden’s proposed minimum tax had been in place for 2020, Amazon’s cash taxes would have been roughly double what it reported, according to an estimate from Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit publisher.<br />Amazon’s current U.S. tax expense, an accounting measure that is the closest approximation for its 2020 U.S. tax bill, was $1.835 billion on $20.2 billion of income, according to the annual financial statement filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That comes to a rate of about 9%, less than half of the 21% U.S. corporate rate but far higher than the equivalent 1.2% rate that Amazon reported for 2019 or its negative rates from 2017 and 2018.<br />The reason Amazon pays less than 21% stems, in part, from decisions by lawmakers. Amazon reported $639 million in tax credits, which companies can get for favored activities such as conducting research or investing in renewable energy. It also got $372 million from a break related to foreign sales from the U.S. and $1.1 billion in benefits from the way its workers’ stock-based compensation is treated.</td>

Diante Johnson, an organizer with Black Voices for Trump last year and a field organizer with Trump’s 2016 campaign, has told associates he may launch a challenge to Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R., Ill.), depending on how the district looks after Democratic-led redistricting in the state this year.<br />According to a person familiar with his thinking, Johnson is leaning toward launching a bid, motivated by Kinzinger’s vote to impeach Trump and his overall opposition to the former Republican president. Kinzinger has said he is at peace with the possibility that he could lose re-election over his Trump stance and launched a political-action committee to support fellow anti-Trump Republicans.<br />In Michigan, an Afghanistan War veteran has threatened to challenge first-term Rep. Peter Meijer, who succeeded another member, former Rep. Justin Amash, who was run out of the Republican Party for supporting Trump’s first impeachment. In South Carolina, a state representative plans to primary Rep. Tom Rice, a conservative stalwart who surprised many with his vote to impeach.<br />Rep. Liz Cheney, the highest-ranking Republican to vote for impeachment, has attracted the most attention for her vote, and has split the party between those who want her stripped of her position and primaried, and those who remain supportive of her continued leadership. She won the first battle in that fight Wednesday by keeping her GOP conference post.<br />PROTECTING CONGRESS after the Jan. 6 riot is a shared goal among congressional leadership and security officials, but the particulars have led to disagreements among stakeholders. A bipartisan group of lawmakers wrote last week to House leaders requesting more flexibility in how members use security funds, especially when they are away from Capitol Hill in their home districts.

      <td>Acting commissioner says agency will publish guidelines over the next few weeks, backs public transparency</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Food and Drug Administration plans to develop speedy means of evaluating possible booster shots for Covid-19 vaccines to ensure that they will work against new variants, the agency’s acting commissioner said Thursday.<br />Dr. Janet Woodcock wasn’t specific about what standards the FDA will use to assess the possible booster shots but said the agency will address these questions in published guidelines over the next few weeks.<br />“If variants emerge that the vaccines have poor efficacy against, we will need to go through these quickly,” she told reporters Thursday evening. She said that full clinical studies of 30,000 patients or more—the sort of large clinical trial used to authorize vaccines so far—would be too time-consuming.<br />Dr. Woodcock said there hasn’t been any determination that boosters will be needed.<br />“With current vaccines, we feel that, against any variants we have seen we have a fair amount of confidence they will provide good protection,” she said. But, she added, “We must prepare for all eventualities. The situation could change, and it could change pretty rapidly.”</td>

      <td>In Eleanor Burgess’s play, a routine meeting between a Black college student and her baby-boomer professor turns into a debate about race in America.</td>
      <td>One of the things theatrical webcasts have allowed me to do is catch up with well-received new plays whose brief off-Broadway runs I missed. Eleanor Burgess’s “The Niceties” had a month-long Manhattan Theatre Club engagement in 2018 and was subsequently taken up by regional companies all over the U.S., of which Madison’s Forward Theater is the latest. I can see why: “The Niceties” is a variation on David Mamet’s “Oleanna” in which the militant student (Samantha Newcomb) is a young Black woman and the benighted, condescending baby-boomer professor whom she seeks to bring down (Sarah Day) is a garrulous middle-aged left-winger who has never questioned her own wokeness. Like Mr. Mamet, Ms. Burgess has stacked the deck high, and the results feel less like an actual human transaction than a scripted, somewhat stilted debate with good-gal/bad-gal dramatic flourishes thrown in.<br />Jointly directed by DiMonte Henning and Jen Uphoff Gray, this production was filmed in what looks like an actual professor’s office. Ms. Day, whom I know from her work as a core-company member of Wisconsin’s American Players Theatre, America’s finest classical theater festival, gives a pitch-perfect performance—she always does—but Ms. Newcomb, who became one of APT’s apprentice actors in 2019, also leaves nothing to be desired. Would that “The Niceties” partook of even a part of the deeply layered ambiguities that drive the best dramas but it is as predictable as “Oleanna,” albeit in what is now a much safer way. Nevertheless, it is an effective vehicle for two first-class actors, and this production will definitely hold your attention.<br />—Mr. Teachout, the Journal’s drama critic, is the author of “Satchmo at the Waldorf.” Write to him at tteachout@wsj.com.</td>

      <td>The potential third vaccine could jump-start a slower-than-expected vaccination rollout</td>
      <td>Johnson & Johnson  asked U.S. regulators on Thursday to authorize the emergency use of its Covid-19 vaccine, setting the stage for a potential third vaccine to become available in the U.S. within weeks.<br />J&J’s move follows last week’s release of results from an international clinical trial showing that a single shot of the vaccine was 66% effective at preventing moderate and severe Covid-19 disease. In the U.S. portion of the trial, the vaccine was 72% effective at preventing disease.<br />The addition of J&J’s vaccine could jump-start a U.S. mass-vaccination campaign that has been choppy since it began in December. There has been a limited supply of the first two vaccines, from  Moderna Inc.  and  Pfizer ,  with its partner  BioNTech SE ,  and distribution roadblocks have caused a slower-than-expected pace of vaccinations.<br />J&J’s shot wouldn’t only boost the overall supply of Covid-19 vaccine doses, but also could simplify vaccinations for many because it is given in one dose. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are administered as two doses, three or four weeks apart. J&J’s vaccine also can be kept at higher refrigerated temperatures for a longer period than the first two vaccines.<br />The New Brunswick, N.J., company expects to have millions of doses available immediately upon authorization, federal officials have said. The company expects to make more than one billion doses in total this year globally. The U.S. government has purchased 100 million doses from J&J, which expects to supply that amount by midyear, a J&J spokesman said. The government has options to purchase more.</td>

Revenue slipped 2.6% to $2.41 billion, primarily due to the loss of contributions from its coupon-publishing unit, which was sold last year.<br />Chief Executive Robert Thomson said the latest quarter was the company’s most profitable in its current iteration, since it was split off in 2013 from the entertainment business, an entity now known as  Fox Corp.<br />He also said Dow Jones had its largest quarterly profit since News Corp acquired it in 2007, and that the long-struggling New York Post had achieved a profit. “That is the first profit in modern times, at the very least, for what was a chronic loss-making masthead founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton,” Mr. Thomson said.<br />The company’s book-publishing unit, HarperCollins Publishers, posted a 23% revenue increase to $544 million, while segment earnings jumped 65% to $104 million, led by such titles as Steve Doocy’s “The Happy in a Hurry Cookbook.”</td>

      <td>House Republicans fail to oblige the Democratic desire for GOP civil war.</td>
      <td>Nearly 70% percent of the House GOP voted to keep Liz Cheney in leadership on Wednesday. Meantime, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she regretted going down the rabbit hole of QAnon conspiracy theories. Not a bad 24 hours for Republicans trying to create a post-Trump future that could win back the suburbs.<br />Ms. Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, came under fire because she voted to impeach President Trump. She did not retreat. “Several Members have asked me to apologize for the vote,” Ms. Cheney told her colleagues, according to one source. “I owe you honesty. I owe you the truth. I cannot do that. It was a vote of conscience. It was a vote of principle—a principle on which I stand and still believe.”<br />Only 10 Republicans supported Mr. Trump’s impeachment. Yet the vote in favor of Ms. Cheney was 145-61. What a blow in particular to Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Trump wannabe who flew to Ms. Cheney’s home state last week to declare: “We are in a battle for the soul of the Republican Party, and I intend to win it.” Ms. Cheney still faces a potentially tough primary, but for now at least the GOP civil war is called off.<br />On Thursday, under pressure from all sides, Ms. Greene disavowed her past cuckoo rhetoric. “When I started finding misinformation, lies, things that were not true in these QAnon posts, I stopped believing it,” she said. School shootings are “absolutely real,” and 9/11 “absolutely happened,” she said. Her comments otherwise, Ms. Greene added, were “words of the past” that “do not represent my values.”<br />Democrats claimed Ms. Greene didn’t exactly say she was sorry, and she’s tweeting about her success online raising $175,000 by promising not to back down. Democrats on Thursday evening stripped Ms. Greene of her committee assignments on a largely party-line vote, 230-199, only weeks into her term.</td>

      <td>But the Republican Party still has a lot of work to do to counter radicalism and conspiracy theories.</td>
      <td>Liz Cheney won. She won’t lose her leadership position after her blistering statement supporting the impeachment of Donald Trump. The vote in the House Republican Conference Wednesday night wasn’t even close, it was reportedly 145-61. Her antagonists spent two weeks bragging they had it in the bag. She insisted on a vote and called their bluff. Suddenly people remembered: She was raised by a House whip.<br />What does it mean? It doesn’t turn the page on the Trump era in Congress but it does, tentatively, begin a new chapter. The pro-Trump group lost, and the We Exist in the Time After Trump forces won. The lopsidedness of the vote implies some sympathy for Ms. Cheney’s stand, or at least grudging respect for the idea of a vote of conscience. Some were likely glad to see someone stand up to a bully, even if they won’t. Some may have been thinking: Hmmm, maybe it wasn’t a good idea to offer quiet encouragement for an insurrection that left five people dead. Some no doubt worried Republicans would be seen as the party of knuckle-dragging louts if they removed the only woman in House leadership for doing what she thought was right.<br />The men who’d threatened her almost from the moment she backed impeachment were left looking like what they are—weak, emotional, spiteful and in the end incompetent. Rep. Matt Gaetz, who swanned around in his Elvis hair in Ms. Cheney’s Wyoming in an attempt to whip up a movement against her, looked especially silly, and left the conference meeting with no statement for the press. Which is exactly how Joe McCarthy left after Margaret Chase Smith gave it to him full in the face on the floor of the Senate 71 years ago.<br />Sometimes things repeat themselves neatly and in a way rich with meaning. (Though to be fair, Mr. Gaetz later tweeted and went on “Hannity,” but I’m sure McCarthy would have too if he could.)<br />Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, after letting Ms. Cheney twist in the wind for a few weeks, spoke forcefully in her support and called for unity. He didn’t relieve freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the QAnon-supporting conspiracist whose social-media accounts appear to have endorsed violence, anti-Semitism and denialism of historic events, of her committee assignments, which was wrong and a mistake.</td>

      <td>Whenever the government is in charge of allocating a scarce good in high demand, there will be rationing and political jockeying. So it is with vaccines as political brawls are breaking out in states over who should be next in line for shots.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended prioritizing shots based on occupation and health factors, but its guidelines are arbitrary and states don’t have to follow them. After nursing-home residents and health-care workers, the CDC says priority should go to those over age 75 and an expansive list of “frontline essential workers.”<br />Then come people 65 to 74 years old, as well as ages 16 to 64 with unspecified “underlying medical conditions which increase the risk of serious” complications plus “essential workers.” The latter include those who “work in transportation and logistics, food service, housing construction and finance, information technology, communications, energy, law, media, public safety, and public health.”<br />By that definition, who isn’t essential? The CDC says its guidelines are intended to “decrease death and serious disease as much as possible,” “preserve functioning of society” and “reduce the extra burden COVID-19 is having on people already facing disparities.” These are all laudable objectives, but the latter two involve political judgments.<br />Many states have already extended eligibility to anyone over 65 before other groups since seniors are at highest risk for severe illness. This has simplified the bureaucracy. Yet as seniors are taken care of and more shots become available, prioritizing people with certain health conditions or politically favored jobs will create a political morass.</td>

      <td>A Connecticut state Senator has a plan for mandatory voting.</td>
      <td>As states consider modifying their voting rules in the wake of the 2020 pandemic mess, the phrase “voter suppression” is being tossed around. To activists on the left, any loosening of election practices is a glorious expansion of the franchise, and any tightening, no matter how minor or politically neutral, is a cynical ploy.<br />What’s the limiting principle? That’s one question raised by a bill in Connecticut to make voting mandatory, on pain of a $20 fine. “Much like jury duty,” Will Haskell, a state Senator, argued in a co-written op-ed last month, “voting should be considered not just an opportunity but a patriotic obligation.”<br />Mr. Haskell has filed a bill to implement this. Here’s how it would work: Starting in 2024, every eligible Connecticut voter would have an obligation to cast a ballot, “with the option to leave such ballot blank.” Those who didn’t participate would later receive paperwork from the state, demanding an excuse. Accepted reasons would include “travel,” “illness,” and “conscientious objection.” Failing to give a good enough alibi would trigger the fine of $20, though the scofflaw could perform two hours of community service instead.<br />“The purpose of this policy isn’t to impose fines,” Mr. Haskell and his co-author said. Except that’s what it would do, dunning $20 from busy single moms, apolitical 19-year-olds, the homeless, or anybody who didn’t care about Election Day enough to remember it. Nonetheless, they argued, the plan “would obviously heighten turnout, moving us far closer to an inclusive and fully representative democracy.”<br />Hmmm. If some people are ambivalent about politics, it’s hard to see how coercing them into voting would improve democratic decision-making. But the attitude on the left is that turnout trumps all. Even basic voting requirements, like deadlines saying that mail ballots must arrive by Election Day, are now under fire for disenfranchising somebody.</td>

      <td>He revives the Obama policy of strengthening America’s enemies and harming its friends.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden implicitly campaigned on Warren G. Harding’s 1920 promise of “a return to normalcy.” But his administration is returning to Barack Obama’s abnormal Middle East strategy. A normal policy would respect the fundamental commandment of sound statecraft: Strengthen friends and punish enemies. It would distinguish between them by asking two simple questions: Which states have tended to shelter comfortably under the American power umbrella? And which have instead sought to destroy the American order? Israel, Turkey and the Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, have functioned as pillars of the postwar American order. By contrast, for the past 40 years Iran has tirelessly opposed the American security system.<br />Three details of Iran’s strategic position could make it more dangerous in the near future. First, the Persian Gulf contains five of the world’s 10 largest proven oil reserves, and Iran threatens to dominate the region. Second, Tehran is increasingly allied with both Russia and China. Third, outreach to Iran by the U.S. has deeply angered most of America’s Middle Eastern allies.<br />A normal policy would seek to contain Iran. Every president since Jimmy Carter regarded Iran as a threat—except Mr. Obama. His flagship policy was the Joint Cooperative Plan of Action, to which Mr. Biden is dedicated to return. The JCPOA won’t contain Iran. Its sunset clauses create a clear path for Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. By lifting sanctions, it supplies the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps with cash.<br />Mr. Obama also dispensed with traditional military deterrence. Tehran saw a green light to expand and arm its militia networks. By the time Mr. Obama left office, Tehran held substantial sway over four Arab capitals: Baghdad, Beirut, Damascus and Sana’a. Donald Trump returned to containment. While revitalizing deterrence and imposing sanctions, he also supported military and intelligence operations by allies, especially Israel, against Iran and its proxies. A new coalition of regional states developed and was formalized in the Abraham Accords.<br />Mr. Trump established significant leverage over Tehran. Mr. Biden appears intent on squandering it. Consider his Yemen policy. One of his first moves was to announce a review of the Trump administration’s designation of the Houthi movement as a terrorist organization. Iran is building up the Houthis as a Yemeni counterpart to Hezbollah. As Hezbollah threatens Israel with precision-guided rockets and missiles, so the Houthis are threatening Saudi Arabia. At the same time, the Houthis provide Iran with a perch on the Red Sea, which guards the approach to the Suez Canal from the Indian Ocean.</td>

If you’re one of the 323 million Americans who don’t live in Kansas City or Tampa Bay, you need to establish some kind of rooting interest. People have all sorts or reasons for how they choose a side, some as simple as liking the uniform colors.<br />My own tools are a bit more obscure, but they may help others provide a cheering rationale.<br />There is the Baconesque technique of rooting for a Chiefs win so that the Jets could indirectly be the best team in the National Football League because in the regular season they beat the Rams who beat the Seahawks who beat the Dolphins who beat the Raiders who beat the Chiefs. Voilà.<br />Some choose based on the city itself. Who doesn’t love a small-market team over Los Angeles, New York or Boston? No immense metropolises are involved this year, but the Tampa area is 50% larger than metro Kansas City. It is also unfairly warmer. Advantage: Chiefs.</td>

      <td>The announcement that Israel would normalize ties with Muslim-majority Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates might have been the highlight of an otherwise dismal 2020. Yet these groundbreaking accords still lack one important child of Abraham. Do Near Eastern Christians have a seat at this table? If not, who can help get them there?<br />Years of international anxiety over the slow demise of Christianity in its ancient homeland hasn’t translated into action. The situation in old bastions like Lebanon, Syria and Iraq is now catastrophic. Egypt, with the largest population of Jesus followers in the region, isn’t much better. That the region’s second most afflicted religious group—after the devastated Yazidis—has gained the least from a long-overdue peace is a painful irony not lost on its persecuted members.<br />Part of the problem is that the regional hostility being rolled back under the Abraham Accords was never a distinctly Christian problem. The centurylong animus between Muslims, the region’s largest group, and Jews, its oldest Abrahamic population and newest recipient of sovereignty, could only be rectified by Jews and Muslims. The relative lack of Christians in any the four Muslim countries that are part the Abraham Accords—Israel has as many as all of them combined—means that Christians simply haven’t been part of the discussion.<br />Another thorny problem is the imprisonment of the region’s most dynamic Christian communities in its other geopolitical axis: the resistance bloc controlled by Iran. Tehran’s belligerence is what first seeded the secret Arab-Israeli collaboration that now manifests as open solidarity. Trapped in the northern tier of Mesopotamia, sandwiched between Shiite and Sunni proxies of Iran and Turkey, these Christians dare not whisper a positive word about normalization with Israel.<br />One final problem is the general lack of Christian sovereignty in the Near East, which precludes them from an independent say on the matter. With the exception of Greece, Armenia and Ethiopia, local Christians—unlike local Jews, who gained independence in 1948—remain subservient players in an Arab conversation that is almost exclusively Muslim.</td>

His aim is to “explore how rethinking happens,” how we change our minds, how we persuade others, and how we build cultures of lifelong learning. “This book is an invitation to let go of knowledge and opinions that are no longer serving you well,” he writes, “and to anchor your sense of self in flexibility rather than consistency.”<br />“Think Again” is full of interesting asides culled from academic research. People who are good at math tend to be good at seeing patterns in data, unless those patterns contradict their views, in which case their intelligence becomes a “weapon against the truth.” The more clever people are, the less willing they are to admit the limitations of their thinking.<br />Mike Lazaridis, the precocious electronics wizard who founded BlackBerry, led his company to a valuation of $70 billion by 2008, only to lead it back into oblivion. He clung to the notion that email was the most important feature of a mobile device, even when the market was turning toward the all-in-one charms of the iPhone.<br />Mr. Grant’s answer to Mr. Lazaridis is that we must think more like scientists and less like preachers, prosecutors or politicians. We should be humble about our convictions and beliefs, curious about the alternatives, and open to discovery and experimentation.</td>

One inmate suffered an orbital wall fracture of her right eye from the attack, he said. Another inmate was beat and had a concussion, he said.<br />"Unfortunately, our investigators were delayed in part by false and misleading reports filed by officers—officers who attempted to cover up what they had done and the injuries they had caused,” Mr. Grewal said.<br />Sgt. Amir Bethea was charged with two counts of official misconduct and two counts of tampering with public records. Sgt. Anthony Valvano was charged with one count of official misconduct and one count of tampering public records. Law-enforcement officials said Sgts.

      <td>In the 1830s, Davy Crockett used it to mean both a gunshot and a torrent of speech; even earlier, a similar word meant rain or lightning</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />When a winter storm blanketed the Northeast this week, it shut down cities, snarled traffic and dumped as much as 30 inches of snowfall in parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. But was it a “blizzard?”<br />Not if you ask the National Weather Service. Their reports on the storm avoided the word “blizzard,” instead referring to it as a “large scale snowstorm and Nor’easter.”<br />The storm matched the general profile of a “Nor’easter,” since it moved along the East Coast with powerful winds blowing in from the northeast. But the weather service uses a specific definition of “blizzard” favored by meteorologists. For a storm to qualify, it must have sustained gusts of wind in excess of 35 miles an hour for at least three hours, with the blowing snow limiting visibility to less than a quarter of a mile.<br />This week’s snowstorm evidently did not make the cut—unlike, say, the twin blizzards in January and February 1978 that hit the central and northeastern U.S. with historic strength. This time around, the ingredients of a blizzard—the falling or blowing snow, the sustained winds, and the reduced visibility—may have all been in play individually but did not occur together for three hours.</td>

T-Mobile in January reported a net gain of 824,000 postpaid phone connections in the fourth quarter. Rival AT&T Inc. said it added 800,000 of those prime customers.

Volvo launched its first battery electric car last year, the XC40 compact SUV, and plans to launch another fully electric car this year.<br />The company said it sold 115,436 plug-in electric cars world-wide last year, about 17% of its total sales of 661,713 vehicles. In Europe, plug-ins accounted for 36% of total sales in the second half and 31% for the full year, driven by sales of the XC40 battery electric model, and the XC60 and V60 plug-in vehicles.</td>

The law empowers platforms to compete for users by creating a variety of forums—from kid-safe and family-friendly to the more provocative and disturbing. It gives small businesses the chance to meaningfully compete against larger companies by saving them from the threat of devastating legal fees. That means Section 230 fosters a competitive internet where all users can engage in forums that best meet their unique needs.<br />Trace Mitchell<br />NetChoice<br />Washington</td>

Friedman (Books, Jan. 30). I have always been taught that the Christian view of work is based on the doctrine of vocation. Martin Luther, studying scripture, came to realize that, while the work of the priesthood is of vital importance, the work of ordinary believers had a dignity of its own which is also honored, and those in ordained offices should not be viewed as being on a higher plane than secular professions and family life. Luther wrote in a 1522 sermon: “When a prince sees his neighbor oppressed, he should think: That concerns me! I must protect and shield my neighbor. . . . The same is true for the shoemaker, tailor, scribe, or reader. If he is a Christian tailor, he will say: I make these clothes because God has bidden me do so, so that I can earn a living, so that I can help and serve my neighbor.”<br />The scriptural basis for this is summarized in Colossians 3:23-24 which says, whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.<br />Matthew Henry (1662-1714) wrote regarding this passage: “It sanctifies a servant’s work when it is done as unto God—with an eye to his glory and in obedience to his command, and not merely as unto men, or with regard to them only.”<br />Duncan Merritt<br />Vestavia Hills, Ala.</td>

Like his friend James Madison, who wrote the First Amendment, Jefferson understood religious freedom as among those natural rights that governments are formed to secure, not to establish.

      <td>Democrats are calling for broad distribution, while Republicans have proposed a more-targeted approach</td>
      <td>Republicans have called for a more-targeted approach to a third round of stimulus checks, while Democrats have argued that broad distribution is necessary to cover gaps in other federal programs. Here is a look at the proposals, which differ both on the size of the payment and in who is eligible.<br />President Biden has proposed checks of $1,400 per person as part of his $1.9 trillion aid plan, effectively topping up the $600 payments from December to $2,000. Democrats promised that amount during the Senate campaigns in Georgia that gave them the majority, and Mr. Biden has shown no signs of budging on that.<br />The Biden proposal didn’t specify the income levels at which the checks would start shrinking, and officials said they were open to discussions on that. In the past rounds, the payments began shrinking once adjusted gross income reached $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples. But Democrats in recent days have talked about setting those levels at $50,000 and $100,000.<br />A group of 10 Senate Republicans has proposed scaling back the checks to $1,000 per adult and $500 per dependent adult and child. The Republican plan would reduce the size of the checks for individuals making $40,000 a year or more and phase them out entirely when income reaches $50,000. Married couples with a joint annual income above $80,000 would see smaller checks, going to zero when income reaches $100,000. The plan didn’t specify the phaseout rules for households with children.<br />The proposals mean that a married couple with two children would receive up to $5,600 from the Democratic plan and $3,000 from the GOP alternative. The Republicans estimate their proposal for the checks would cost $220 billion, less than half the cost of the Democratic plan that the House passed in December.</td>

      <td>In France’s Oscar entry, Martine Chevallier and Barbara Sukowa play closeted lovers looking forward to a new life together.</td>
      <td>‘Two of Us,” France’s Oscar entry, is set mainly in a quiet residential neighborhood in southern France—the unspecified locale is Montpellier and its environs. But the story plays out on a shifting border between grand amour and amour fou—a passion burns steadfastly bright while desperation opens the door to madness. And physical doors keep opening and closing; it’s as if a modern-day Feydeau had turned from farce to romance and impending tragedy. This debut film by Filippo Meneghetti, streaming on major digital platforms, is elevated by the beauty of its performances, and by its masterly technique, which would suggest a filmmaker at the height of his career, not someone directing his first feature. Most remarkably, though, the drama captures the timeless essence of unconditional, all-consuming love through a pair of unlikely heroines, two women in their 70s who maintain separate apartments across the hall from each other.<br />They met decades ago in Rome and have lived in France ever since, lesbian lovers still awkwardly and affectingly closeted because one of them, Madeleine (Martine Chevallier), could never bring herself to break away from her husband and family. Now, after the recent death of Mado’s husband, she and her partner, Nina, a Berliner by birth played by the distinguished German star Barbara Sukowa, have plans for a bright future—leaving France and living the life they’ve always dreamed of, together in Rome. (The film, in French with English subtitles, was originally called “Deux,” a better title that bespeaks the strength of their bond.) But Mado suffers a failure of courage, followed by a stroke that leaves her paralyzed, unable to speak and dependent on a caregiver who sees Nina only as the next-door neighbor, not her charge’s surpassingly significant other. Romance devolves into obsession, devotion into horror, as Mado grows increasingly isolated and Nina fights for every opportunity to be close to the woman she loves.<br />When movies are as memorable as this one, it’s seldom because the plot is stunningly original. Elements of this story have come forth in various combinations over the past few years. What gives “Two of Us” its singular power is the hurtling urgency of the storytelling and the brilliance of the acting. Mr. Meneghetti and his script collaborators, Malysone Bovorasmy and Florence Vignon, hedge no bets, observe no constraints. For the caregiver, Muriel, a drab yet paradoxically vivid woman played by Muriel Bénazéraf, Nina becomes an adversary in an undeclared custody battle. For Mado’s daughter Anne (Léa Drucker) and son, Frédéric (Jérôme Varanfrain), their mother’s friend and neighbor is inexplicably intrusive. (The siblings’ naiveté may seem equally inexplicable as described, but it’s believable as dramatized.) For Nina, meanwhile, proximity to Mado is nothing less than a matter of life or death.<br />Which is how the actress plays it. In the radiance of her youth Ms. Sukowa was the protégée and muse of the German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and later the star of hard-edged political films by Margarethe von Trotta. Her performance here is fearless, to say the least; it’s also fevered, frightening and transcendent, with no concern for clear boundaries, just as Nina’s behavior is, by turns, selfless, selfish, admirable, reckless and self-destructive. (Depending on the scene, the superb cinematographer Aurélien Marra makes Ms. Sukowa look shockingly haggard or startlingly beautiful; the truth of the moment trumps the aesthetics.)<br />And one great performance is reflected, and complemented, by another. Ms. Chevallier’s portrayal of Mado, so full of life at the outset, becomes of necessity a study in mysterious nuance. In Mado’s diminished state, how well does she understand what’s happening to her? What is she feeling as she sits in her wheelchair, gazing into an unfathomable mid-distance?</td>

      <td>FBI Agent Clarice Starling returns in a new CBS series.</td>
      <td>It would be best to temper any expectation of a horrorfest to come in “Clarice,” despite the title character’s prominent role in the Thomas Harris novels “The Silence of the Lambs” (1988) and “Hannibal” (1999), not to mention the 1991 “Silence” film starring Jodie Foster as FBI agent Clarice Starling. All the drama of this sharply written new tale is focused devotedly on Clarice, now portrayed with heart and intelligence by Rebecca Breeds.<br />Borne up by wit and an undeniable emotional punch, the CBS series has its beginnings in the early 1990s—roughly a year after the terrors that occurred in “The Silence of the Lambs.” Agent Starling—who had, many months earlier, rescued a young woman imprisoned in the basement of the monstrous predator known as Buffalo Bill—now finds herself the recipient of an urgent message from that young woman’s mother, Ruth Martin. Who, as it happens, holds the position of attorney general. The attorney general (an electrifying Jayne Atkinson) urges Agent Starling to join up with the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program, or Vicap (an actual FBI program). She’s needed to help solve the case of three new serial killings.<br />It’s not a surprising request. Clarice has, as she regularly proves, unique gifts as a crime analyst. One scene has her noting the psychological pretensions of one murderer. The killer was desperate to leave proof that he was impassioned, a man on fire, when in fact, Agent Starling concludes, he was “cold as hell. The wounds he made shows it.”<br />Starling will turn her attention to those three serial killings, but not without dismay. On no subject is she more opposed to the views of her superiors than in the matter of serial killers—which is the instantly agreed upon official answer when any mysterious murder takes place. This is intolerable to Clarice, who believes in much more detailed consideration of the evidence, and who is ever skeptical of received wisdom. She is, as well, unworried about contradicting others—whether her fellow agents or her FBI superiors. It’s the FBI superiors who give her trouble, but she’s been told more than once that her fellow FBI agents aren’t fond of her either—information that fails to trouble her. In this decidedly confident and glamorous character—the product of a far from idyllic childhood who has endured the most harrowing of experiences at the hands of psychopathic killers—the series has its social commentator: the one who understands the motives for everything going on. She’s quick to figure out, for instance, that the reason officials in the agency jump to the conclusion that the latest murder is the work of a serial killer has something to do with the attention the subject brings. It’s sensational news—the kind that attracts the press.<br />No event in the story available thus far (just three of the 13 episodes were provided for review) showed more potential for the sensational than the one in which Clarice and her FBI colleagues have to do battle with rogue militia types who make it entirely clear that they don’t recognize the authority of the U.S. government. Here they are also guilty of shooting a federal officer. The series takes considerable notice of the history of anti-government insurgents. There’s mention of Waco, Texas—site of the 1993 siege that lasted nearly two months at the compound of the Branch Davidians, a struggle that involved ATF agents, the U.S. military and Texas law enforcement, and ended with a toll of nearly 80. The mention of Waco is raised as a kind of warning and a pledge—whatever action the FBI of this series undertakes, it must not result in another Waco.</td>

      <td>A newlywed couple fears the worst in a pandemic that wipes people’s memories.</td>
      <td>The next-to-best reason to watch “Little Fish” (in theaters and streaming on demand) is that it’s an oddity—a small-scale film about a pandemic that finished shooting more than eight months before Covid-19 hit. The best reason, to be explored in a moment, is that it’s a really good movie. (Chad Hartigan was the director. Mattson Tomlin adapted the screenplay from a short story by Aja Gabel.)<br />In the fictional pandemic, a malady called NIA—neuro-inflammatory affliction—takes people’s memories, not their lives. One could argue, and the film does, that losing the former is as bad as losing the latter, but the emphasis at first is on the spread of the disease. A pilot forgets how to fly. A marathon runner forgets to stop running. A bus driver stops his bus, gets out and wanders off; he’s forgotten why he was sitting behind the wheel. Many of the resonances with our present circumstances are eerie: a frightened populace, learning to wear masks; the emergence of quack cures followed by conspiracy theories, one of which contends that the government has a real cure but is spreading NIA in order to limit personal freedom.<br />At the center of the encroaching chaos are newlyweds Emma (Olivia Cooke) and Jude (Jack O’Connell). She’s bright and lively, a veterinarian with a scientific bent. He is younger than his years, an earnest and tender musician who’s been pulling himself together after having put himself through hard times. They’re instantly likable, not least because they’re played by exceptional actors. In 2015 Ms. Cooke was Rachel, the terminally ill high-school student in “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” a lovely film you should see if you haven’t already, or see again if you have. Mr. O’Connell gave one astonishing performance in the 2013 prison drama “Starred Up,” then another, a year later, in “’71”; he played a bewildered young British soldier left behind in a botched attempt to control a street riot in Northern Ireland.<br />The dramatic strategy in “Little Fish” is a smart one. Working with a modest budget, the filmmakers have used the microcosm of a relationship to reflect the larger subject of the pandemic—echoes of “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” in counterpoint to a sort of “Invasion of the Memory Snatchers.”<br />Yet the result is better than smart, it’s stirring. With the NIA pandemic as a pretext, the essential subject becomes memory—its fragility, its wondrousness, its centrality to our existence as sentient beings. When Jude can’t recall what happened on their wedding day, both he and Emma instantly sense incipient tragedy. Who will he be—who will they be—if they can live only in the present tense? In one way “Little Fish” is just the latest addition to a growing genre, films about memory loss due to Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia. What makes it especially poignant, though, is the relative youth of its main characters. Emma and Jude don’t have long lives to look back on, vast arrays of experiences to savor. But the memories they cherish, and share, are no less precious for being limited in number. That’s all they’ve got. They are what they remember.</td>

      <td>A Tampa theater’s top-notch revival of John Patrick Shanley’s drama about a priest accused of sex abuse translates seamlessly to streaming.</td>
      <td>Some plays are so obviously well-suited to socially distanced webcasting that I can’t imagine why every regional theater company in America hasn’t taken them up. John Patrick Shanley’s “Doubt: A Parable” is a case in point. It has only four characters, none of whom is required to touch or closely approach any of the others, and it calls for no set pieces other than a door, a desk, a phone, two chairs and a couple of park benches. Nothing more is needed but appropriate costumes, atmospheric lighting and sound design, and a director and cast unafraid of the thorny ambiguities of Mr. Shanley’s 2004 study of a regular-guy priest suspected of molesting a child in his care by a hard-nosed nun who takes it for granted that he is guilty, notwithstanding the absence of hard evidence.<br />Even so, Jobsite Theater’s revival of “Doubt,” directed by Summer Bohnenkamp, is the first version I’ve seen online since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is also a memorably fine piece of work. I’ve reviewed many productions of “Doubt,” going back to the off-Broadway premiere and its Broadway transfer, and this one is as good as any version I’ve seen, not excluding the original. Shot onstage in an empty Tampa theater, it gets everything right, above all the cast. David M. Jenkins, Jobsite’s producing artistic director, plays Father Flynn, the likable priest; Roxanne M. Fay plays Sister Aloysius, the suspicious nun; Andresia Moseley plays Mrs. Muller, the mother of the effeminate black boy who has attracted Father Flynn’s attention; and Emily Belvo plays Sister James, a younger nun who cannot bring herself to believe that Father Flynn is capable of sexual misconduct. They are a fabulously well-matched ensemble, never stooping to the exaggeration that is a perpetual temptation in a play like “Doubt,” and Ms. Bohnenkamp has staged the play with transparent clarity, deploying her four actors like chessmen on a board and keeping them in perfect counterpoise.<br />“Doubt” was well filmed in 2008 with Mr. Shanley in the director’s chair and an all-star cast (Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Viola Davis and Amy Adams). But it works better in the theater, and Jobsite’s production conveys the intimacy of a theatrical staging so precisely and evocatively that it loses nothing in the translation to streaming video.

      <td>Two farmer brothers who haven’t spoken in 40 years must work together to save their sheep flocks in this Australian remake of the 2015 Icelandic original.</td>
      <td>You can’t unring a bell, and you can’t unsee an original—a truly original original—when you’re watching an inferior remake.<br />It was love at first screening when I discovered “Rams” at the 2015 Telluride Film Festival. A deeply affecting deadpan comedy from Iceland, the film, written and directed by Grímur Hákonarson, follows the lives of two sheep-farmer brothers, Gummi and Kiddi, who live on adjacent properties but haven’t spoken to each other for 40 years. The rest is not silence. When disease suddenly threatens their respective flocks, the brothers grapple with their existential crisis eccentrically but heroically.<br />Now a remake from Australia is upon us, playing in theaters and streaming on demand. It’s still called “Rams,” and the change in geography makes perfect sense, the Australian sheep-farming industry being a huge one. (The film is set in the arid vastness of Western Australia, east of Perth.) The basic plot is the same, with adjustments made for culture and temperament. One of the brothers, now called Les, is played appealingly by Michael Caton. The other, Colin, is played by Sam Neill, who by this time qualifies as one of Australia’s national treasures.<br />So far so good, and the fate of the sheep is just as heartbreaking as it was in Iceland. (Their eyes could melt the hardest hearts.) But the director, Jeremy Sims, and the writer, Jules Duncan, have no gift for, or interest in, comedic nuance. The first warning sign comes in the person of a government agent who shows up to enforce a death sentence decreed by the local department of agriculture; he’s a caricature of a bureaucrat, and a tedious nitwit. Mr. Neill struggles with the film’s laggardly pacing—not for long, since he’s a canny veteran with a trusty bag of tricks, but long enough to remind you that stars are as vulnerable to clumsy direction as anyone else. (Miranda Richardson is a pleasing but intermittent presence as an English veterinarian, working for the government, who finds Colin as attractive as he is elusive.)<br />This remake isn’t terrible, just tentative and too long by at least 40 minutes. That’s due to a climate-change subplot in which raging fires threaten to destroy everything in their path, meaning the town as well as the farms that surround it. The idea may have made perfect sense to the filmmakers; Australia has suffered terribly from recent fires. But the more the night is illuminated by flames, and the sun is obscured by smoke, the more you miss those sheep, with their formidable horns and sweet faces.</td>

The publisher didn’t release financial terms of the book.<br />Hunter Biden kept a relatively low profile during the presidential campaign, then appeared prominently at his father’s side when he declared victory and again on Inauguration Day. The release of his book is likely to return him further to the public spotlight.<br />The younger Mr. Biden, who turned 51 on Thursday, is an attorney and businessman. His service on the board of a Ukrainian energy during and after his father’s tenure as vice president has drawn wide criticism and was a central issue in the first impeachment of President Donald Trump. He faces a federal criminal tax investigation, for which he has denied any wrongdoing, and has drawn scrutiny for his business dealings with European and Chinese tycoons, some of whom were eager to be associated with the Biden family name.<br />The Wall Street Journal first reported in Sept. 2019 that Mr. Trump had repeatedly pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden, saying that he was engaged in corrupt activities. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump and his allies argued that Joe Biden, while vice president, had sought the removal of Ukraine’s top prosecutor to protect the gas company, Burisma Holdings, from investigation.</td>

      <td>Extra-virgin olive oil...grapeseed oil...sesame oil? Depends on how you use it. For frying, sautéing, dressings and more, these bottles are beauties.</td>
      <td>TURNS OUT even an ingredient that seems pretty basic can lead you down a rabbit hole. Take cooking oil. Some types are better for high-heat cooking; others are ruined by high temperatures, losing their delicate flavors and even turning rancid. What should you use and when? Here’s your guide.<br />The smoke point is the temperature at which oil will smoke and break down into free fatty acids. Refined oils, stripped of impurities and volatile compounds, have higher smoke points while virgin or raw oils burn more easily, said Harold McGee, author of the seminal “On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen.” A refined olive oil (often labeled “light”) has a smoke point of 485 degrees, while extra virgin’s is 410 degrees.<br />Oil heated past its smoke point may give food a bitter flavor, and some studies suggest it can be unhealthy. Still, these dangers are often overstated for home cooks: You’d have to inhale a lot of smoke and ingest a lot of oil to suffer toxic consequences. So consider smoke points but, for most cooking, let flavor and price be your guide. And no matter which oil you choose, store it in a cool, dark place.<br />Extracted from the pits of wine grapes, grapeseed oil has a clean, neutral flavor and a high smoke point (between 400 and 420 degrees) that make it extremely versatile. Use it for searing, frying, baking and for dressings where you don’t want the oil to outshine other ingredients. One to try: La Tourangelle Grapeseed Oil, $6 for 16.9 ounces, amazon.com<br />Conventional wisdom says this oil has too low a smoke point for high-heat cooking. But according to the International Olive Council, extra-virgin olive oil has a smoke point of 410 degrees, plenty high to sauté vegetables or meat. That said, save the highest quality oils for poaching, dressings or drizzling. Look for a harvest date——stored properly, a good oil can last about two years—and dark bottles or opaque tins, as sunlight will cause the oil to degrade. One to try: Olio Piro, $59 for a 16.9 ounces, olio-piro.com</td>

Passing the budget resolution will move Democrats forward with reconciliation, a process that allows the Senate to pass legislation with a simple majority. The House approved the budget resolution Wednesday.<br />Because the budget is nonbinding and never becomes law, the amendment votes are largely symbolic, a factor that can influence how much support they receive.

      <td>Ciara, Oprah, Shaq and Serena are among the celebrities companies are tapping as directors for their pop-culture expertise and as a marketing boost</td>
      <td>Pop star Ciara Wilson’s meteoric career has traveled a familiar arc—first a string of hits, then a fragrance brand and a fashion line.<br />Now the Grammy-winning singer is taking on a role that has become increasingly popular among entrepreneurial-minded celebrities: corporate director.<br />Announced Thursday, Ms. Wilson’s appointment to the board of Seattle marketing-tech company Amperity Inc. makes her the latest famous face to bring star power to a company boardroom. She also recently joined the board of  Bright Lights Acquisition Corp. , a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, focusing on entertainment, sports and consumer brands that went public last month.<br />From tennis star Serena Williams to Oprah Winfrey and basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal, more companies are recruiting athletes, entertainers and other celebrities to boards, executive recruiters and corporate-governance experts say. Their addition can bring valuable insight into cultural trends and consumer behavior, some CEOs say, while generating buzz for brands among coveted younger consumers. Along the way, the unconventional recruits often bring different experience and more ethnic diversity to boards, something more companies are seeking—and are under investor and, in some cases, regulatory pressure to achieve. (In California, for example, a new law requires greater diversity on public-company boards.)<br />When Amperity CEO Kabir Shahani thought of recruiting Ms. Wilson, a longtime friend, to the private company’s board, he asked a business contact: “Hey, is this crazy?” The board included corporate veterans such as Starbucks Corp. CEO Kevin Johnson and other executives who had built companies or developed technology.</td>

He was unhappy about how his boss, WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar, had surprised him with a reorganization of the company’s executive ranks, The Wall Street Journal reported.<br />The two executives have since patched up those disagreements, according to a person familiar with their relationship, who called the disputes growing pains.<br />“It’s great to have Jeff steering all things CNN in 2021,” Mr. Kilar said in a statement. “As I’ve said before, in my opinion, the two best things to happen to CNN have been Ted Turner and Jeff Zucker.”<br />Since Mr. Zucker didn’t agree to stay at the network beyond this year, WarnerMedia will soon need to contemplate who will fill his role.</td>

      <td>Covid restrictions for international trips are more complicated than ever. Before you dust off your passport, a few words of caution</td>
      <td>THE COVID-19 VACCINES have arrived. Does this mean we’ll soon be free to roam the world, guilt- and hassle-free? The short answer is no. While an inoculation protects you from getting sick, it’s not yet known whether the vaccines will prevent an asymptomatic person from passing the virus to others. The shots “are extraordinarily good at preventing symptoms if you contract the virus, but we don’t know if you can still spread the virus after vaccination,” said Matt McCarthy, associate professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.<br />Medical experts say that it will take months to reach the herd immunity—which some estimates put at 70% to 80% of the population—that will allow normal life to resume, much less normal travel. Most vaccines require two doses several weeks apart, and another month for the full benefits to kick in, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Bottom line: You’ll still need to follow guidelines on mask use, social distancing and Covid testing if you want to get out of Dodge.<br />Meanwhile, look for “immunity passports” to become the latest travel accessory, as tourist destinations gear up to reopen. United,  Lufthansa ,   JetBlue  and other airlines are already backing an app called Common Pass that allows carriers to verify your test results and vaccine status. The International Air Transport Association is testing a similar Travel Pass with  British Airways ,  Emirates airline, Singapore Air and several other carriers.<br />Australia on your bucket list? Flagship carrier  Qantas ,  which has been partially grounded since last March, plans to ramp up long-distance flights later this year but it’s considering only allowing passengers who can show proof of a Covid inoculation.<br />So, a vaccine passport might not be your Get Out of Jail Free card anytime soon. It’s “a nice idea but there are many logistic hurdles,” said Dr. McCarthy. “If someone was vaccinated in January, will they be immune in August? We don’t know.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she regretted past social-media comments embracing conspiracy theories, hours ahead of an expected vote by the House to sanction the freshman Georgia Republican by stripping her committee assignments.<br />In a speech on the House floor Thursday, Mrs. Greene said she regretted posts she made about QAnon, the far-right-wing, loosely organized network and community of believers who embrace a range of unsubstantiated beliefs. Mrs. Greene said she realized in 2018 that she was receiving misinformation and stopped believing it.<br />“I was allowed to believe things that weren’t true and I would ask questions about them and talk about them and that is absolutely what I regret,” she said Thursday, wearing a “Free Speech” mask. “If it weren’t for the  Facebook  posts and comments that I liked in 2018, I wouldn’t be standing here today and you couldn’t point a finger and accuse me of anything wrong, because I’ve lived a very good life that I’m proud of.”<br />Democrats criticized Mrs. Greene’s speech, saying her remarks fell short of an apology. “It was unpersuasive,” said Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D., N.C.). “It is so easy to say ‘I am sorry.’ Those are three important words in our culture.”<br />House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) opted Wednesday not to remove Mrs. Greene from her committees over her incendiary past comments, but urged her to publicly denounce them. Democrats said they would hold a vote to kick her off unless Republicans acted first.</td>

It recently hired new executives including Chief Financial Officer Jody Macedonio and Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Cristina Alesci.<br />“As we create the food company of the future, we’ll look at all options carefully to fuel our ambitious plans, especially with oatmilk and plant-based products,” Chobani founder Hamdi Ulukaya said in a statement. “An IPO is definitely one exciting direction but whether or not we’re public, we’ll keep disrupting and making things better.”<br />The IPO market has been on a tear, with high-profile debuts of companies including  Airbnb Inc.  and  DoorDash Inc.  late last year, and it has rarely if ever been more hospitable to new entrants. There has also been an avalanche of new special-purpose acquisition companies, with dozens of the so-called blank-check vehicles looking for targets to merge with.

CBP said the Biden administration will continue using what legal authorities it has to keep migrants out of crowded detention facilities during the pandemic.<br />Mexican immigration and foreign ministry officials said Mexico hasn’t ended its practice of accepting all returned migrants, but officials in some stretches of the border have made “adjustments” to accommodate a change in Mexico’s immigration law that bars officials from holding migrant children and their families in detention centers run by the immigration service. Those migrants must now be turned over to the DIF, Mexico’s social-service agency for children and families.<br />“The law says we can’t have minors in immigration centers, they must be taken to shelters run by the DIF, where they wait until their migratory status is defined,” said a spokeswoman for Mexico’s immigration agency.</td>

      <td>Tools for stopping variants are limited, and like masks and distancing, vaccines are not a panacea.</td>
      <td>Each stage of the American Covid-19 pandemic has been marked by a singular public-health message that crowded out all other perspectives. From early calls to “crush the curve” with shutdowns and pleas to stay at home, then to claims that face masks would end the pandemic, these messaging strategies have sowed unrealistic expectations and delayed public acceptance of reality. The most recent message is “universal vaccination,” an aspiration whose unattainability may further delay the country’s return to social and economic normalcy.<br />How did we arrive at this point in the pandemic? The media’s campaign to stoke fear about collapsing health systems, along with their portrayal of severe illness as the inevitable consequence of infection—despite a thousandfold difference in risk between old and young—contributed to an atmosphere of distrust. Animosity toward Donald Trump—justified or not—fueled this campaign. Health officials abetted the discord by abandoning longstanding public-health tenets that emphasize harm reduction and a nonjudgmental outlook. Instead, these experts promoted mandates for the healthy and public shaming of people who strayed from guidelines.<br />Now the fear and distrust have made a substantial proportion of the U.S. population unreceptive to a vaccine. While vaccine receptiveness might be expected to vary based on a person’s risk of illness, a January Gallup survey showed that a stronger predictor is political preference. More than 80% of Democrats are willing to be vaccinated, but only about 45% of Republicans are.<br />The long vaccination lines seen on television will eventually thin as Americans most worried about contracting Covid-19 receive their shots. Many of the estimated 100 million Americans who aren’t interested in vaccination are unlikely to change their decision voluntarily.<br />What also isn’t serving vaccination efforts: the lack of transparent communication from public-health officials that meets people where they are and sincerely acknowledges the concerns of millions who view Covid-19 vaccines with suspicion. Concerns have been dismissed or derided as “misinformation.” It’s true that serious adverse effects appear to be uncommon, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. But responding to these worries by insisting more loudly that the vaccines are safe isn’t an effective strategy. A wiser strategy is to address these concerns with data about what is known, and honesty and humility about areas of uncertainty—such as vaccination in pregnant women.</td>

Family-friendly features include a shallow, protected children’s beach, a sandy-bottomed kids’ pool and a kids’ club. Cultural stewardship is important here—the 32-acre property was an aquaculture site for ancient Hawaiians—and Mauna Lani offers nature walks and workshops in lei-making, ukulele, weaving, among other activities sure to outshine the more pedestrian quarantine pastimes (see: breadmaking).

He admitted cutting and pasting client signatures to divert money and make stock  bets without their knowledge, causing more than $150 million in losses, according to the Geneva criminal court.<br />The regulator, Finma, publicly censured Credit Suisse in 2018 for inadequately supervising and disciplining Mr. Lescaudron as a top earner, and said he had repeatedly broken internal rules, but it revealed little else about the bank’s actions in the matter.

According to NFIB:<br />Today’s NFIB report is consistent with numerous other readings showing a healthy U.S. economy at businesses both large and small. And the good news is happenings across various sectors. The Journal’s Paul Hannon and Gwynn Guilford report that “ IHS Markit  said its U.S. services index was 58.3, up from 54.8 in December and the second-sharpest increase in almost six years.” The Journalists add:<br />As for hiring, NFIB isn’t the only one sharing encouraging news. The Journal’s Hannah Lang reports:<br />The latest data should give Americans hope that the economic revival that began last summer is set to continue.</td>

      <td>Antioxidants are all well and good. But sometimes the real benefit is in the making. This recipe for a warming mugful of lemon, ginger and turmeric is as satisfying to make as it is to drink.</td>
      <td>YOU’LL READ the title of this cocktail recipe, see that it has ginger and turmeric and lemon in it, and think you know why I’m calling it healthy.<br />And you’ll be right. For thousands of years, people have used ginger to treat colds, arthritis, even migraines, and modern clinical research bears this out: Ginger has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; it can alleviate symptoms of nausea and aid cardiovascular function. Turmeric, ginger’s plant-family cousin, contains curcurmin, also a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. Lemons are a good source of vitamin C, cayenne pepper can help with digestion, unfiltered apple cider vinegar contains helpful bacteria, and honey is just delicious. The drink’s creator, Jim Meehan, calls it “a post snow-shoveling cocktail” and says it was loosely inspired by the Master Cleanse.<br />You’ll also note that there are no spirits in this drink. I’m not anti-alcohol, but there are benefits to taking breaks or otherwise moderating your intake. But there’s a less obvious benefit to consider, too.<br />Before making the Get Well Soon I hadn’t worked with turmeric root, which imparts an earthy, woodsy flavor and an incandescent carrot hue. Honestly, it’s difficult to peel and stains everything it touches, but even these are good reasons to use it. According to neuroscientist David Eagleman, when we face new tasks, especially frustrating ones, we build new pathways in our neural networks. “The best thing we can do as we get older is to keep challenging ourselves,” he said on Brené Brown’s “Unlocking Us” podcast.<br />And, hey, if you put in the work, you might even enjoy your drink more. “The IKEA Effect,” a 2011 study published by researchers from Harvard Business School, Tulane University and Duke University, showed that when participants assembled IKEA boxes, folded origami or built sets of Legos themselves, they valued the end product more highly than when others did the work. And effort without completion did not increase valuation, so stick with it, all the way down to the clove-studded lemon-wheel garnish. It’ll be good for you.</td>

A white plaster statue enters the scene—representing the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets—and buys up not one, but two cans of Guinness. “This is bad news for your hedge funds,” she says, waving the puppet to the camera.<br />Her series has drawn nearly three million views. “With something like short selling, it can sound like gibberish, quite theoretical and jargon-heavy. You get more and more lost with the more words you don’t understand,” said Ms. Parkins, a Dublin-based journalist for Ireland AM, in an interview.<br />As the Reddit-fueled rally and subsequent tumble took Wall Street by storm, people everywhere struggled to make sense of the market movements behind the headlines.<br />Rather than ignore the moment, the internet took it and swallowed it whole. Creators of TikTok videos, memes and other internet quips enlisted Beanie Babies, “Real Housewives” and Target dresses to shed some light on key financial concepts needed to grasp the situation—short selling, the short squeeze and how options work.</td>

It also helps Twitch, a platform mostly used by videogame enthusiasts, to broaden its reach.<br />Programming will feature intimate live performances from established and up-and-coming musicians, Mr. Wenner said. The channel will also air interviews of musicians by other musicians, shows detailing how famous songs came to be and news programming focused on music and culture.<br />The channel will primarily focus on selling advertising and sponsorships for its programs to finance operations, Mr. Wenner said. Rolling Stone has built a studio inside its Manhattan offices to use for the channel, although much of the content in its early days will rely on remote feeds from artists’ homes due to Covid-19 restrictions.</td>

      <td>Publisher posts flat fourth-quarter revenue amid advertising declines</td>
      <td>New York Times Co.  said 2020 was a record year for digital-subscription growth but the publisher posted flat fourth-quarter revenue, partly reflecting continued declines in advertising revenue during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The company said it added 2.3 million net digital subscribers last year, which Chief Executive Meredith Kopit Levien called “an outlier year for net subscription additions” during an investor call Thursday.<br />In the fourth quarter, the Times added 627,000 net new digital subscriptions compared with 393,000 in the third, the company said. Of those, 425,000 signed up to the paper’s core news offering and 202,000 for lower-cost digital products such as its cooking and crossword apps.<br />Ms. Kopit Levien said the company reached two milestones last year: Digital revenue overtook print revenue, and revenue from digital subscriptions became the publisher’s largest revenue stream. “Those two milestones,” she said in a news release, “mark the end of the first decade of The Times’s transformation into a digital-first, subscription-first company.”<br />Fourth-quarter revenue was basically flat, rising 0.2% to $509.4 million. Subscription revenue increased 15% to $315.8 million, but advertising revenue fell 19% to $139.3 million and other revenues decreased 12% to $54.3 million reflecting fewer episodes of its television series, and lower contributions from live events and commercial printing. Those declines were partially offset by higher affiliate referral revenue from Wirecutter, the company’s product-review website.</td>

      <td>After a huge 2020 for digital spending PayPal has momentum in a new realm, in-store payments</td>
      <td>PayPal Holdings  is breaking into stores across America.<br />For years, investors wondered if the digital-payment giant would cross over into the physical realm in a big way. The pandemic, which has been a boon for contactless tapped or scanned payments, seems to have gotten that ball rolling.  PayPal  on Wednesday said its payments with QR codes—digital scrambles that can be displayed by phones and scanned at checkout counters—are now accepted at more than 600,000 retail locations, and that in 2020 it had signed up 29 large enterprises such as  CVS  and  Macy’s  to offer them. PayPal did more than $20 billion worth of in-store volume across its payment types in 2020.<br />That is just a small piece of the nearly $1 trillion in total payment volume PayPal did last year—but it is important volume for investors to track. For one, volume growth in a new arena will be vital as PayPal tries to sustain the momentum built by the pandemic’s behavioral shift to digital spending. PayPal recorded 31% currency-neutral total-payment-volume growth in 2020, and says it expects this to slow only somewhat in 2021, to the high 20’s. Prior to the earnings report, analysts were expecting only 24% growth in 2021, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.<br />Plus, in-store transactions are relatively profitable for PayPal. For one, having a viable in-store option apparently pumps more volume through already-acquired users’ accounts: Last year, there was a 19% increase in payment volume for PayPal users who started regularly using QR codes. This helps PayPal more closely embed itself in users’ day-to-day lives, giving it further opportunity to offer its growing list of services, like buy-now-pay-later and bill payments. PayPal’s branded in-store transactions like QR codes also generally have better take rates, or how much of the volume ultimately becomes revenue for PayPal, than many kinds of online payments.<br />Volumes for pent-up digital spending like travel and events may also rebound this year, as consumer habits normalize. To keep surpassing investors’ already-high expectations for the shares, which are up about 110% over the past year, more growth in-store would be a big help.</td>

      <td>Nearly all senators belong to the party that won their state’s presidential contest in November</td>
      <td>The 50-50 Senate that is trying to find agreement on a coronavirus relief bill isn’t just evenly split. It is also operating under partisan pressures that, by one measure, are greater than ever.<br />Some 94 senators belong to the party that won their state’s presidential contest in November—a record-high level of party allegiance for at least 54 years, an analysis of data gathered by the Pew Research Center shows. That leaves a record-low six senators as political mismatches with their home state’s presidential choice: Three Democratic senators represent states that backed former President Donald Trump, and three Republicans come from states that President Biden won.<br />Just two weeks since Mr. Biden took office, it remains unclear how the dynamics of the divided Senate will affect his legislative agenda, which includes a proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.<br />With more voters siding with a single party, current and former senators say, it may mean many lawmakers have less flexibility to work with the opposing party to strike deals—a necessity in a chamber where 60 votes are needed to pass most legislation.<br />That presents a potential challenge for Mr. Biden, who has made calls for national unity a central theme of his presidency and has said he wants bipartisan support for his coronavirus response proposal and some other priorities.</td>

      <td>Germany’s largest lender will likely face tougher operating conditions as well as higher investor expectations in 2021</td>
      <td>Deutsche Bank  faces a new problem in 2021: higher investor expectations.<br />On Thursday, the German bank reported steady full-year results, buoyed by a stellar performance from its investment bank and lower credit losses. Despite the pandemic, management slightly over-delivered on its three-year transformation plans—a notable success after years of unfulfilled promises.<br />The investment bank capitalized on market volatility and actually gained market share in some businesses. And shareholders weren’t hurt by the European Central Bank’s ban on dividends, as they were at peers, since Deutsche Bank’s 2019 and 2020 dividends were already canceled as part of its turnaround plans.<br />But this year could be very different, as capital markets normalize and the economy is weaned off government-support programs. Although Germany performed relatively well in the first wave of the pandemic, its home-market economy still contracted 5% in 2020 and the country hasn’t been spared in the second wave.<br />Chief executive Christian Sewing highlighted that the bank’s credit losses were “significantly lower” than many peers. The group credits its high proportion of low-risk German mortgages and limited exposure to crisis-impacted sectors. However, ECB officials warned last month that European banks could be underestimating the credit trouble ahead.</td>

      <td>Republicans see political opportunity as teachers’ unions, which support the president, have pushed back on some reopening plans</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden’s pledge to reopen most K-8 schools in his first 100 days is being challenged by new fast-spreading coronavirus strains, a slow vaccination rollout, uncertainty over economic-relief legislation and clashes between state authorities and teachers’ unions.<br />Mr. Biden has made education a top priority and is pushing for more funding for schools to reopen. He and his fellow Democrats enjoy close ties to teachers’ unions, which have pushed back on many reopening plans around the country. And as angst over school closings grows, some Republicans think the issue could give them a political opportunity.<br />Given the federal government’s limited ability to influence the operation of local school districts, which falls chiefly to local and state governments, Mr. Biden’s school-return plan comprises principally of $130 billion in funds for K-12 schools in the $1.9-trillion Covid-aid plan he has proposed to Congress.<br />The money would go to school districts to pay for reducing class sizes to accommodate social distancing, improving ventilation, hiring more janitors and providing more personal protective equipment, according to the proposal. Mr. Biden has also issued an executive order calling for the development of federal guidance for safely reopening schools and is pushing for funding for expanded Covid-19 testing to support schools.<br />The fate of the aid legislation is uncertain, however, given Republican objections about the overall size of the bill and over the inclusion of state and local aid. A competing Covid-aid proposal from a group of 10 Republican senators includes $20 billion for K-12 schools. Democrats are pursuing passing a bill without GOP votes.</td>
