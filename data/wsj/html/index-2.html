      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden is scheduled to meet in the White House on Wednesday with senior labor union leaders, who are hoping to win commitments for a massive federal investment in infrastructure as well as efforts to create jobs in clean tech and alternative energy, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, will be meeting with the president and Vice President Kamala Harris in the Oval Office, and may be joined by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and other labor leaders, according to some of the people.<br />White House officials have been holding regular meetings with lawmakers and outside groups as the president prepares to unveil an economic recovery package that will focus on improving U.S. infrastructure and creating jobs. Last week, Mr. Biden met with a bipartisan group of senators, as well as mayors and governors.<br />When asked about Wednesday’s meeting, White House spokesman Vedant Patel said via email that the administration “will evaluate infrastructure proposals based on our energy needs, their ability to achieve economy wide net zero emissions by 2050, and their ability to create good paying union jobs.”<br />Late Tuesday night, the White House confirmed the president’s Wednesday meeting with union leaders to discuss infrastructure and the administration’s economic relief efforts, but didn’t provide any other details.</td>

But the prior relationship between Mr. LaPierre and the Brewer firm makes it “highly unlikely” that as the NRA’s counsel the Brewer firm would look into or advocate for any claims the group may have against him, the U.S. Trustee said.<br />“The statements in this legal filing, like others, reflect a misinformed view of the Brewer firm, its billings and its advocacy for the NRA,” said Charles L. Cotton, first vice president of the NRA. “I, and all the officers, fully support the work the firm is doing, the results achieved, and the value of its services. As we have stated before, this relationship has been reviewed, vetted and approved,” he said.</td>

Burgess Everett, Heather Caygle and Marianne Levine reported in Politico on what happened after senators agreed to call witnesses:<br />Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night could stay lawmakers from their solemn impeachment duty. But observance of a marginal unofficial holiday seems to have done the trick.<br />Whether or not one believes in a senatorial duty to honor the sanctity  of Valentine’s Day, James Downie of the Washington Post argued on Sunday that it’s a little early for Congress to be demanding time off. “Less than a full month into Joe Biden’s presidency, Congress is already entering a week in recess,” noted Mr. Downie.</td>

The pandemic turned this process on its head, but it’s not all bad. Networking chats have become easier to set up. When connecting means clicking “join meeting” rather than traveling to a coffee shop, people are much more available. Without the need for a subway ride or a sticky name tag from security, an open half-hour truly is 30 minutes long.<br />The downside is that there is no real opportunity for spontaneous meetings and connections. A virtual conversation with someone working from home has near-zero potential to lead to “hold on a second, I think Jess is in her office. You should meet with her, too.” The organic flow typically associated with building rapport and evaluating company culture is missing.</td>

      <td>How bad energy policy led to rolling blackouts in the freezing Lone Star State.</td>
      <td>Why are millions of Americans in the nation’s most energy-rich state without power and heat for days amid extreme winter weather? “The people who have fallen short with regard to the power are the private power generation companies,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott explained. Ah, yes, blame private power companies . . . that are regulated by government.<br />The Republican sounds like California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who lambasted private utilities for rolling blackouts during a heat wave last summer. Power grids should be able to withstand extreme weather. But in both these bellwether states, state and federal energy policies have created market distortions and reduced grid reliability.<br />Mr. Abbott blamed his state’s extensive power outages on generators freezing early Monday morning, noting “this includes the natural gas & coal generators.” But frigid temperatures and icy conditions have descended on most of the country. Why couldn’t Texas handle them while other states did?<br />The problem is Texas’s overreliance on wind power that has left the grid more vulnerable to bad weather. Half of wind turbines froze last week, causing wind’s share of electricity to plunge to 8% from 42%. Power prices in the wholesale market spiked, and grid regulators on Friday warned of rolling blackouts. Natural gas and coal generators ramped up to cover the supply gap but couldn’t meet the surging demand for electricity—which half of households rely on for heating—even as many families powered up their gas furnaces. Then some gas wells and pipelines froze.<br />In short, there wasn’t sufficient baseload power from coal and nuclear to support the grid. Baseload power is needed to stabilize grid frequency amid changes in demand and supply. When there’s not enough baseload power, the grid gets unbalanced and power sources can fail. The more the grid relies on intermittent renewables like wind and solar, the more baseload power is needed to back them up.</td>

      <td>As states weigh reform, a new project aims to collect best practices.</td>
      <td>Hundreds of bills to reform voting processes have already been introduced in state legislatures this year, but there’s plenty that the laboratories of democracy could learn from one another. To that end, it’s worth watching a new project of the Republican State Leadership Committee.<br />The RSLC, which is the umbrella group for GOP state lawmakers and secretaries of state, is launching a commission on election reform. “We want to find the best practices that are used in every state in the union, and make sure those are available for legislative bodies in the 50 states to consider as options,” says one of the co-chairs, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill. “We have a singular goal, and that is to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat—period.”<br />A call went out for ideas some weeks ago, and state leaders submitted suggested best practices on everything from signature verification to audit procedures to pre-election testing of voting equipment. The new commission’s role, Mr. Merrill says, will be to sort through that stack, and more, to “see how we can determine which ones need to be presented to legislative bodies across the nation.” The aim, he adds, is for the commission to have something substantive to release within weeks.<br />The potential here won’t be lost on anyone who followed the 2020 election mess. To take one example, voters amid the pandemic adopted mail ballots en masse, but some states don’t handle absentee votes until Election Day. Pennsylvania legislators considered allowing preprocessing but disagreed with the Governor on how many days were needed. That’s one small reason the Associated Press didn’t call Pennsylvania for Joe Biden until four days after Nov. 3. State law also lacks clear rules for signature verification, and counties diverged on whether to count undated ballots.<br />For states moving toward absentee voting, Mr. Merrill says, the model should be their peers like Colorado that have gone to mail ballots exclusively. “When you talk about mail-in,” adds the commission’s other co-chair, Michigan state Senator Ruth Johnson, “the devil is in the details, if you want to have that transparency and accountability and integrity. It’s not good or bad, necessarily, but the devil is in the details.”</td>

      <td>Senators explain why a stock exchange can’t impose social policy.</td>
      <td>Can President Biden’s regulators say no to progressives when they try to bend the law? An early test will come for Mr. Biden’s nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler. Nasdaq is seeking the SEC’s blessing to enforce new diversity mandates for corporate boards. But as Pennsylvania’s Pat Toomey and all 11 other Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee explain in a new letter to the SEC, the quotas run headlong into federal securities law.<br />Every company must have “one director who self-identifies as female,” and one “who self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+,” the stock exchange instructs. Alternatively, the company can publicly “explain why” it “does not have at least two directors on its board who self-identify in the categories listed above”—identifying itself as a Nasdaq pariah.<br />The Senators write that they “commend individual firms for the proactive efforts they have already made in recruiting, promoting, and maintaining diverse talent.” But they go on to say that Nasdaq’s mandates fail “to demonstrate that this proposed rule advances investor protection” or “is otherwise consistent with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.”<br />The diversity mandate conflicts with the law’s command that companies nominate board members who will serve the best interest of shareholders. The Senators observe that “religion, age, political affiliation, geographic location, educational background, veteran’s status, or physical disability” are also measures of board diversity. Yet Nasdaq ignores them in favor of categories that align with elite America’s political mood. That suggests the interests of investors aren’t the priority.<br />The Senators add that the Nasdaq rule also “violates the concept of materiality” in securities law. Materiality focuses disclosure on information that is critical to an investor’s decision. “The materiality doctrine prevents the development of an unstable, politicized securities regime that would be ripe for abuse of power,” they write. Securities law leaves “social policymaking for democratically elected representatives.” Nasdaq wants to make social policy by forcing disclosure of information that “would not help a reasonable investor evaluate a company’s performance.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Former President Donald Trump criticized Sen. Mitch McConnell in a lengthy statement following the Senate minority leader’s blistering condemnation of Mr. Trump’s actions leading up to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot by his supporters.<br />“Mitch is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack, and if Republican Senators are going to stay with him, they will not win again,” Mr. Trump wrote in a statement released by his political action committee. He later added: “The Republican Party can never again be respected or strong with political ‘leaders’ like Sen. Mitch McConnell at its helm.”<br />Mr. McConnell joined all but seven Republicans in voting Saturday to acquit Mr. Trump in his impeachment trial, but followed that with a speech that laid blame on the former president for stirring up a crowd, as the two Republicans and their respective allies engage in a broader fight over Mr. Trump’s future role in the party.<br />“They did this because they had been fed wild falsehoods by the most powerful man on Earth—because he was angry he’d lost an election,” Mr. McConnell said. “Former President Trump’s actions preceding the riot were a disgraceful dereliction of duty.”<br />While Mr. McConnell took the position that it was unconstitutional to put a former president on trial, he added: “We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one.”</td>

      <td>Washington should not tolerate foreign actors who wrongfully or unlawfully imprison U.S. citizens.</td>
      <td>As President Biden revamps many aspects of U.S. diplomacy and national security, he should adopt a policy that none of his predecessors had the courage or resolve to: zero tolerance for the unjust detention of Americans abroad. The wrongful detentions of some 40 to 50 U.S. citizens have been publicly reported, but the real number is likely much higher. The State Department in 2019 estimated that around 3,000 Americans are imprisoned abroad, but it has never looked into whether the detentions are just.<br />The U.S. government has increased its focus on freeing unlawfully or wrongfully detained Americans in recent years, but it hasn’t gone far enough. President Obama created an interagency system to assist families and coordinate government response. President Trump went further, securing the release of dozens of Americans from a variety of countries including Egypt, Turkey and Iran, as well as from terrorist groups such as the Taliban.<br />Yet the Trump administration’s efforts were uneven. It failed to secure the release of longtime American hostages such as Siamak and Baquer Namazi in Iran or Austin Tice in Syria. And it went strangely out of its way to assist some Americans whose detentions appeared to be legitimate, such as rapper A$AP Rocky, who was arrested in Sweden after a street fight, and three University of California, Los Angeles basketball players arrested in China for shoplifting.<br />Not every important change has come from the executive branch. Under a new provision, tucked into a law passed in late December, the State Department must review all cases involving U.S. citizens detained abroad and determine, based on 11 criteria, which are unjustly detained. When this determination is made, the case must be referred to the special presidential envoy on hostage affairs to develop and implement a strategy to secure their release. These collective efforts in individual cases will be presented in an annual report to Congress, creating greater visibility and focus on bringing them home.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken is off to a strong start in building on these efforts. At his confirmation hearing, he testified that “doing everything we possibly can to bring any American home who is being unjustly detained anywhere in the world or is a hostage” is a priority. This was an important warning to governments that wrongfully detain U.S. citizens.</td>

      <td>In my small Missouri town, we’re awaiting an exodus from the beleaguered cities.</td>
      <td>Tarkio, Mo.<br />I’ve read at least a dozen articles predicting a movement away from cities toward the hinterlands as urbanites flee crime, congestion and Covid for a simpler life. Remote work is the wave of the future, and we’ll all be doing our Zoom conferences from somewhere else. Manhattan and Silicon Valley will look like mining ghost towns, places where the mother lode has been exhausted. Even though Miami and Austin, Texas, seem to be the preferred destinations for the techno-refugees, U-Haul reports that Missouri is the seventh leading destination for people using its services.<br />In my northwestern Missouri town of some 1,500 people, we’re not exactly bracing for a population boom. Sure, we’ve got internet, I’ve done dozens of remote meetings in the past year, and I’m sure that some of the locals have discovered the joys of Robinhood, but young urban professionals are much likelier to leave New York or San Jose for Boise, Idaho, or the Hill Country of Texas. Tarkio isn’t on their menu.<br />That’s a shame. Tarkio has been declining since about 1900, but it’s not that bad. We’re close to the interstate, and the flooding along the Missouri is always at least 7 miles away. Riots are nonexistent, at least so far, but so is street life. Which has its advantages. You don’t need a bike lane when small animals can live out their life spans in the middle of Spruce Street, where I live, without being disturbed by traffic.<br />The biggest scandal in town is that this summer we had a rash of people blowing grass clippings into the streets. This, I gather from social-media posts, is dangerous to motorcycles. I’ve only ever seen one two-wheeled vehicle drive by my house. Billy, the local biker, has a bandanna, a T-shirt, a mullet and a motor scooter that tops out at about 30 miles an hour. He’s not exactly the Hell’s Angels, but if keeping grass out of the streets helps Bill, I’m in.</td>

      <td>Inventing words was once thought pretentious. Now it is considered an achievement, though it may still induce ‘coiner’s remorse.’</td>
      <td>The children’s author Theodor Geisel, otherwise known as Dr. Seuss, was often asked where he drew inspiration for his verbal inventiveness. Surely there had to be some enchanted source for the words he dreamed up—the ones that caught on, notably “grinch,” and the ones that might pleasingly have done so, such as “punkerish” and “flubbulous.” He would solemnly reply that in August each year he traveled to have his cuckoo clock serviced in a tiny Alpine village called Uber Gletch. “I wander around and talk to people in the streets,” he explained. “They are very strange people, and I get my ideas from them.”<br />Dr. Seuss is one of the heroes of “The Hidden History of Coined Words,” in which Ralph Keyes—the author of more than a dozen books, including “Euphemania” and “I Love It When You Talk Retro”—explores the byways of etymology. But, as this eloquent and instructive survey shows, the stories behind coinages are seldom so zany or romantic. Mr. Keyes makes clear how hard it is to create a word and get other people to adopt it—even if it has the virtues of brevity, vividness, a playful air and a memorable sound. Although new nouns, verbs and adjectives are forever coming into being, most make no impression. Some sparkle for a while, then fade from view. Only a few succeed, and they are “as likely to be created by chance as by intention.”<br />The first person to refer to “coining” words seems to have been George Puttenham, a 16th-century English courtier. Although quite a coiner himself—“insect,” “predatory,” “indecency”—he was ambivalent about the habit. For many of his contemporaries, new words were as unwelcome as bad smells, and 300 years after Puttenham complained about semi-educated students getting snared in new-fangled verbiage, it was still common to think that coining words was shamefully pretentious. Mark Twain was at pains to tell a correspondent that he’d never done it, though he conceded that he might have called attention to a few previously obscure terms. Theodore Roosevelt was relieved to think he bore no responsibility for any coinage. This from the man who minted “bully pulpit” and “lunatic fringe.”<br />Today it’s a different story. We prize the ability to give a phenomenon a catchy handle, and people’s coinages are regarded as part of their legacy. Take the New York Times obituaries of psychologists George Weinberg and Herbert Freudenberger, which even in their headlines identify the deceased as the coiners of important words: “homophobia” and “burnout,” respectively. But in many cases the person who takes credit for a word—or is awarded credit—isn’t the first to have used it. The term “emotional intelligence” wasn’t invented by Daniel Goleman, whose first book on the topic was so popular in the mid-1990s, and “tipping point” predates Malcolm Gladwell’s bestseller of a few years later.<br />Mr. Keyes admires several writers whose originative powers seem beyond dispute. One is the poet John Milton, who gave us “jubilant,” “depravity,” “echoing” and “fragrance.” Another is Milton’s contemporary Sir Thomas Browne, who came up with “suicide,” “ferocious” and “misconception.” But the abiding impression of Mr. Keyes’s account is that a coinage is a happy accident, often the result of a prank or a moment of whimsy—and that in most cases the person behind it will have left no other mark on the language.</td>

Answer: Shut up, denier.<br />Likewise because the weather inflicted painful blackouts on millions of voters, politicians hinted that market manipulation by energy traders may play a role. These manipulators will never be found. But shut up about that too.<br />Folks in the Northeast accustomed to weeklong outages may be surprised when Texans mostly have their power back in hours. Hundreds of downed power lines aren’t the problem as they are elsewhere. Texas winter blackouts come wholesale when generating plants trip offline due to conditions that will quickly be remedied when temperatures return to the 50s and 60s this weekend.<br />In fact, Texas has plenty of generation to keep its system from cracking even under summer air-conditioning demand, and more than enough in principle for a winter cold snap. Texas’ grid operator pledged to get to the bottom of why 34,000 megawatts nevertheless dropped offline, but we already know the answer because the same thing happened in 2011 and 1989.</td>

      <td>If the filibuster is a ‘Jim Crow relic,’ so is a policy designed to curtail the abundance of black labor.</td>
      <td>Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week that the House version of the next coronavirus aid package will include a $15 federal minimum wage, adding that “27 million people will get a raise, 70% of them women.”<br />In truth, Mrs. Pelosi has no idea how many people would see a raise because she doesn’t know how many people would keep their jobs. Employers may decide that they can’t afford to pay someone a $15 hourly wage, so workers could be let go or offered fewer hours as a result. A new Congressional Budget Office report estimates that 1.4 million jobs would vanish, and no one knows how many people would never be hired in the first place because they’ve been priced out of the labor force. Politicians gloss over these trade-offs, but they are basic economic facts of life.<br />Mrs. Pelosi’s reference to female workers is also misleading. Democrats have long held up single working moms as the typical minimum-wage earner, but that’s a myth. A 2014 analysis by economists Joseph Sabia and Richard Burkhauser found that the vast majority of workers who would benefit from a minimum-wage increase live in nonpoor households. According to Mr. Sabia, “only 13 percent of workers who would be affected live in poor households, while nearly two-thirds live in households with incomes over twice the poverty line, and over 40 percent live in households with incomes over three times the poverty line.”<br />Such findings would seem to underscore the limits of using minimum-wage laws to address poverty. Most workers who earn minimum wages are not a family’s sole breadwinner. They tend to be teenagers living at home or senior citizens working part-time to stay busy in retirement. According to Mr. Sabia, single mothers made up less than 5% of those who potentially would benefit from a minimum-wage hike.<br />What Democrats play down is that most minimum-wage earners aren’t impoverished, and most people who qualify as poor already earn more than the minimum. Poor families need jobs more than they need raises. And what teens and young adults most need are opportunities to accumulate job experience that can lead to higher pay and upward social mobility down the road. By reducing employment opportunities, minimum-wage laws can make inequality worse.</td>

It also lifted a stay from September that prevented the publication of the records.<br />A coalition of unions sued New York City in July seeking to block the release of officers’ disciplinary records in cases where claims against them are unsubstantiated, arguing that the publication of the records would harm the officers. A three-judge panel found that argument lacked merit.<br />New York public-safety agencies—including the New York Police Department—have long cited Section 50-a of the state’s Civil Rights law in decisions to keep secret the disciplinary files of officers. The statute said personnel records used to evaluate the performance of a public safety officer are deemed confidential and cannot be exposed without a court order or the written consent of the employee.<br />State lawmakers in June voted to repeal the law as part of a series of changes to policing that followed nationwide protests inspired by the May 25 killing of George Floyd. Mr. Floyd, a Black man, was killed in police custody in Minneapolis. Soon after the law was repealed, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, announced plans to create a public online repository of NYPD records. Subsequently, the unions brought their suit.</td>

      <td>Nico Muhly’s two-person opera inspired by the true story of Joyce Mitchell, a prison tailor who helped two inmates escape; a SOLO performance by John Holiday of an 1887 temperance poem set to music by Tyshawn Sorey.</td>
      <td><br />The pandemic shutdown has pushed opera companies to commission new works designed to be viewed on computer screens. Catapult Opera, founded by the conductor Neal Goren (formerly head of the now-defunct Gotham Chamber Opera), had planned to present its first-ever season live in 2020-21. Foiled by Covid-19, the company instead launched a digital commissioning program. The first result is “The Glitch,” a 22-minute, two-character opera by composer Nico Muhly and librettist Greg Pierce. As filmed by director Marcus Shields, performed by baritone Lester Lynch and soprano Krysty Swann, and conducted by Mr. Goren, the piece powerfully demonstrates how the small screen can make opera—often the grandest of art forms—truly intimate.<br />The characters are based on real people: Joyce “Tilly” Mitchell and her husband, Lyle. In 2015, Tilly, a civilian employee who worked in the tailor shop of a prison, helped two inmates escape by providing prison contraband. She had agreed to accompany them once the men broke out, and part of the scheme involved killing her husband. But at the last minute, she did not join the convicts on the run and Lyle was not murdered. The opera imagines Tilly’s conversation with her husband after she has confessed and gone to prison herself. (Readers might remember the story from the television series “Escape at Dannemora,” which dramatized the tale.)<br />Mr. Pierce’s trenchant libretto drills deep into the couple’s questions for each other and themselves, their motives and their bond. “How could you? Who are you?” Lyle asks. Tilly’s response, a romantic fantasy about the prisoner Richie and a dream of escape from everyday life, turns darker with her realization that Richie, a convicted murderer, might well have abandoned or killed her while they were on the lam. Lyle answers her erotic taunting with an invented dalliance of his own that Tilly knows almost instantly is a lie. And even though Tilly suggests that killing Lyle (whom the conspirators called the “glitch” in the plan) was her idea, not Richie’s, and that she wants to be rid of him even now, he insists that he will stand by her.<br />“The Glitch” delves so skillfully into the immediate emotional reality of these two people that you don’t even need to know the background. Mr. Muhly’s lyrical vocal settings and atmospheric piano accompaniment performed by Adam Tendler feel like natural expressions of emotion, be they rapturous imaginings or angry confusion. The singers are filmed with darkness around them, as if they are alone in the void with their feelings and each other; Mr. Shields astutely often shows the reacting partner instead of the singing one, so we hear the words and see their effect. The intensity of the voices—Mr. Lynch’s opulent baritone and Ms. Swann’s wiry mezzo—and both singers’ remarkable ability to act with their faces are such that their performances never seem oversized or artificial on the small screen. Instead, we are drawn into their worlds. The real power of opera is less in its grandeur than in its ability to express the otherwise inexpressible; “The Glitch” does that with extraordinary grace.</td>

AR-15 style rifles have been used in some of the deadliest U.S. mass shootings, including attacks at a concert in Las Vegas in 2017 and a high school in Parkland, Fla., in 2018.<br />The Canadian government said it plans to introduce a buyback program for the banned firearms in the coming months, and will make it illegal to transfer, sell or bequeath the weapons outside of that program.<br />The government said its buyback program will be voluntary. That means someone who decides not to turn in a banned military-style semiautomatic weapon can still store it as a collectors’ item but must abide by rules governing its storage and can never transfer or legally use the firearm.</td>

In the context of Ms. Baker’s oeuvre, this sound alone marks a major shift.<br />Her first album, 2015’s “Sprained Ankle,” a collection of shadowy folk numbers, almost exclusively featured her voice, acoustic guitar, and a bit of piano. On 2017’s acclaimed follow-up, “Turn Out the Lights,” she plugged her instrument into an amp and added touches of strings and woodwinds, but the record was drum-free and still spare in the extreme. Yet that organ chord on “Hardline” and the percussion that enters shortly after suggest that we’re in for a different kind of experience on album number three, one where instrumental color and sharper melodies share the load with Ms. Baker’s dark lyrics and expressive singing.</td>

      <td>In a Netflix series based on the Sarah Pinborough novel, coincidences lead a single mom to become entangled with a psychiatrist and his troubled wife.</td>
      <td>There’s no such thing as coincidence, people say, but those people have not seen “Behind Her Eyes,” which presents several whoppers of happenstance before it’s even warmed up. As readers of the Sarah Pinborough novel know—and unsuspecting customers will find out—mere terrestrial phenomena of time and place can’t hold a votive candle to the otherworldly avenues the storyline will follow, into what will no doubt be dead ends of epic eye-rolling and consumer consternation.<br />All of which is odd, because the six-part series, created by Steve Lightfoot, does what it does very well, as long as it remains rooted in the human. Louise (Simona Brown) and David (Tom Bateman) literally run into each other inside a London pub, requiring Louise to compensate for the drink spilled on David. He will thereafter smooch Louise when they’re saying good night on the sidewalk. She’s not entirely unreceptive, but he’s apologetic and flees into the night. And wouldn’t you know it? The next day, David turns out to be the new psychiatrist at the medical practice where Louise works as a secretary.<br />“What’re the odds?” Louise will say, to which a viewer might respond “You tell me.”<br />The divorced Louise has a son, Adam (Tyler Howitt), who is adorable; the married David has a wife, Adele (Eve Hewson), who is disturbed. How and why are the mysteries that propel the first couple of episodes. She seems to be a doting spouse. “They’re lucky to have you,” Adele says, as her husband leaves for his first day on the new job. “Like me.” He cringes. When she assures him that “I’ll be here” when he gets home that night, it sounds like a threat. Generally speaking, sex scenes are, all titillation aside, fairly useless. They tell you nothing about characters or motivations. But thanks to Norwegian filmmaker Erik Richter Strand, who directed this entire U.K.-based series, the one between Adele and David says almost everything about their relationship that needs to be said. It’s eloquent, as is one that comes later in the show, and contains all the joy the first one lacks.<br />There are tantalizing bread crumbs of psychological innuendo strewn all over the path from Scotland, where we meet a much younger Adele, to London, where she and David have only recently moved. They’ve had to relocate frequently over the intervening 10 years, it seems, and the reasons will become more and more evident after Louise, walking down the street, literally knocks Adele over. They’ve not previously met, but soon discover they have David in common. The chance encounters just keep coming.</td>

      <td>Jennifer Harrington’s smart horror film skewers social-media influencers—literally.</td>
      <td>That the horror platform Shudder is presenting “Shook” is appropriate enough: The streaming service is a virtual catalog of frightful content, and Jennifer Harrington’s feature is a connoisseur’s movie. An update on the slasher film, it takes the plot devices common to the classics of the form—the ultraviolence, the simple morality, the deserving victims, the emotionally tortured villains—and tweaks them into today. Most significantly, and humorously, Ms. Harrington uses social media the way “Halloween,” “Scream” and “When a Stranger Calls” used the land-line telephone—as a weaponized instrument of torment.<br />That director Harrington makes social-media influencers the victims of her mayhem—but not before making them ridiculous—is a guilty pleasure, and meant to be. When we first see Mia (Daisye Tutor) and her fellow stars of online marketing, they are being photographed at what appears to be a red-carpet event. Lights are flashing. Mics are waving. Enthusiastic crowd noise is percolating. Then the camera pulls back and we see the truth—the young women and their camera crew are inside an otherwise abandoned warehouse, with prerecorded sound pumped in and no one around but them. Which is spooky: On the loose in their Southern California community is a serial murderer of small dogs. Yes, dogs. But before the evening is over, said killer will have graduated to people, with one of the influencers impaled on her own stiletto heel.<br />It has to be said that several of Ms. Harrington’s forays into physical violence (she co-wrote the story with Alesia Glidewell) will make one wince, flinch and/or recoil. But such cringe-inducing content is hardly foreign territory within the genre being deconstructed. Nor are ambivalent characters. Mia, for instance, is a classically conflicted heroine/victim: Her late mother, who died of the hereditary “Livingston’s disease,” was cared for solely by Mia’s sister, Nicole (a terrific and funny Emily Goss), who asked Mia for help and was rebuffed. Needing to travel for her own medical care, Nicole asks Mia to babysit her dog, and for the first time Mia agrees to do it—but only because it’s good for her brand, given the ongoing dog murders. (No dogs are actually harmed in the making of this movie, but there are crime-scene photos…) Once she’s alone at Nicole’s, with the dog, Mia is besieged by threatening calls, from someone who at times seems to be inside the house.<br />One of Ms. Harrington’s ingenious moves is the demonization of the smart home, and the possible repercussions of living one’s life online. “How do you know Jade?” Mia asks her mystery caller, when he refers to one of her friends. How would he not know Jade? Everything about Mia’s life is available on the web, or courtesy of Alexa (renamed Diana here, after Nicole and Mia’s mother). Nicole’s house is set up with surveillance cameras (because of her invalid mom); Mia’s life is one long live feed. Her every thought becomes a text. The horror isn’t just about what’s going to happen to her, but the life she leads. At least for the time being.<br />“Shook” has the requisite twists to make it much more than a straightforward horror-shocker, and the sharp turns are sufficient to have viewers profoundly dizzy about where it’s all going to go.

      <td>Suit filed by NAACP, Rep. Bennie Thompson also names Proud Boys, Oath Keepers as defendants</td>
      <td>The NAACP, on behalf of Rep. Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against former President Donald Trump and his former personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, accusing them of conspiring to incite the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />The lawsuit also names two right-wing groups, Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, as defendants. Some members of each group have been arrested in connection with the attack, which left five people, including one police officer, dead.<br />The lawsuit, filed in Washington alleges that Messrs. Trump and Giuliani and members of the two groups conspired to prevent Congress from fulfilling its official duties to certify election results—which they allege violates the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act. That law, which targeted unrest after the Civil War, allows suits seeking compensation for civil-rights violations.<br />Lawmakers were in the process of certifying President Biden’s electoral victories on Jan. 6 when the rioters swarmed the Capitol, halting the process for hours. Lawmakers and aides were rushed out of the House and Senate chambers, huddling in office buildings and, in some cases, hiding for hours until law enforcement was able to end the riot. Videos played during the impeachment trial showed the mob coming close to finding aides hiding in the Capitol.<br />“January 6th was one of the most shameful days in our country’s history, and it was instigated by the President himself. His gleeful support of violent white supremacists led to a breach of the Capitol that put my life, and that of my colleagues, in grave danger,” Mr. Thompson said in a statement.</td>

A civilian U.S. contractor who was a Filipino national was killed and nine others were injured.<br />At least three other people were injured outside of the base, according to Iraqi officials. Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s self-governing Kurdish region, has long been an enclave of calm in a region still recovering from years of war.<br />The air base is located within a high-security complex that also includes Erbil’s civilian international airport. The airport is protected by multiple layers of security and managed to keep operating even when Islamic State forces came within mere miles of the city in 2014.<br />President Biden was briefed on the attack, a White House spokesman said Monday night, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Kurdistan Regional Government Prime Minister Masrour Barzani and Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi to discuss the attack, according to officials from both countries.</td>

The Denver-based company, which provides software focused on helping businesses as well as defense and intelligence agencies analyze data, saw its shares rise from a $10 debut in a direct listing in September to as high as $39 in late January, according to FactSet.<br />The stock has fallen since then and traded down about 12% to $28.05 Tuesday afternoon, as executives said they expect Palantir to generate revenue growth of more than 30% annually over the next five years. That rate could potentially be slower than the 47% gain it recorded for 2020 compared with 2019.<br />The company isn’t “focused on the day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, near-term focus that, quite frankly, destroys businesses,” said Chief Executive Officer Alexander Karp. “It’s one of the main reasons why so many of our businesses, especially in tech, are actually only serving Wall Street and not serving their clients,” he added.<br />Palantir plans to expand its sales team by triple-digit levels this year, operations chief Shyam Sankar told investors Tuesday.</td>

      <td>Exposure and frozen pipes threaten cattle; dairy farmers are forced to dump milk after plant shutdowns</td>
      <td>Bitter cold and power outages have created a crisis for some Texan farms and ranches, leaving livestock dead from exposure and raising fears that herds could run short of food and water.<br />Forced shutdowns of plants that process milk and make animal feed are disrupting the state’s agricultural supply chains, industry executives said. Some farmers are being forced to dump tankers of milk on fields because it can’t be processed, and state agriculture officials feared livestock may have to be euthanized if they cannot be watered and fed.<br />“No feed, no water, and no heat doesn’t make for a good situation,” said Sid Miller, Texas agriculture commissioner. Mr. Miller on Tuesday said he was urging state utilities to restore electricity to rural areas—some of which he said had gone without power for more than 30 hours straight—while fielding calls from cattlemen losing calves to the cold and poultry farmers struggling with frozen water pipes.<br />A rare winter storm over the weekend and record-low temperatures in some parts of Texas caused power demand in the state to outpace supply, as thermostats were cranked up. At the same time, freezing temperatures forced some natural-gas and coal-fired power plants offline, while wind turbines in West Texas froze and snow blanketed banks of solar panels. Texas power officials called for rotating outages to manage the shortfall, but in some parts of the state those measures have led to extended stretches without power.<br />The situation has turned into chaos for some producers in one of the country’s most livestock- and poultry-heavy states. Texas in December counted about 2.9 million cattle on feedlots, the most in the nation, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The state’s dairies house the country’s fifth-largest dairy herd with about 613,000 milking cows, and Texas is the sixth-biggest chicken producer, raising about 675 million birds for slaughter in 2019, according to the latest USDA figures.</td>

      <td>Aurora Flores hadn’t gone out much during the pandemic. But recently she forced herself to take a walk in New York’s Central Park to clear her mind and seek solace in the sound of birds and a waterfall. As she was strolling down the path, another woman approached, wearing a mask. Letting out a loud yelp, the woman flung a handful of birdseed in the air.<br />Suddenly, a flurry of titmice, cardinals, blue jays and robins appeared, as Ms. Flores stood there amazed. The stranger offered her some seeds, and Ms. Flores poured some on her gloved hand, holding it out in front of her. One by one, the birds began to land on her fingers.<br />“I was elated. I felt blessed,” says Ms. Flores, 67, a writer. “She saw me beaming, and I could tell she smiled. Then she went on her way.” Now, Ms. Flores says she is motivated to go outside almost every day.<br />Strangers can soothe and support us when no one else is around, or boost our mood with a smile or a laugh. They can distract us from the chatter in our own head and help expand our perspective. They can make us feel connected and remind us we are not alone.<br />Yet we’re missing out on many of these serendipitous moments during the pandemic. Social distancing, working from home and the disruption of normal activities have reduced our opportunities for casual exchanges with people we don’t know, or with whom we have only loose ties. Yet, if we work at it, it’s possible to generate those moments even now—and psychologists say we should.</td>

With backing from two-thirds of people under 56 years old, a majority of American adults say the government should actually annul all student debt. Even boomers, who by a slight majority oppose voiding any student loans, overwhelmingly want the government to insert itself into the marketplace and impose price controls on the cost of higher education.</td>

      <td>Regarding Sadanand Dhume’s “Rihanna Rallies to the Wrong Cause in India” (East Is East, Feb. 5): Greta Thunberg and Meena Harris would condemn India to feudal agrarianism if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi were to heed their calls and rescind his historic agriculture deregulation. Half of India’s workers toil as serfs in low productivity, undignified subsistence farming with the sector accounting for a paltry 15% of the economy. Compared with the average American farm plot of 440 acres, 86% of Indian agriculture holdings are less than five acres and are too marginal to ever achieve economies of scale. Indian crop yields consequently are half of those of the U.S. Due to rapacious government-backed wholesale cartels, the markup between prices remunerated to farmers and what consumers pay is 65% in India compared with 10% in other nations. Forty percent of India’s fruits and vegetables rot before reaching the marketplace because of anachronistic antihoarding laws that deter investment in refrigeration.<br />Mr. Modi’s audacious market reforms are vital for weaving together his country’s 4,000 fragmented agriculture markets into a national whole. McKinsey & Co. estimates that a robust decontrol of farming could raise cultivation output by $175 billion, doubling farmers’ incomes over eight years. Untangling farmers and supply chains from a morass of red tape, grain-storage limits and monopolistic middlemen—coupled with more private investment—is an eminently sensible policy regime, unlike the usual nostrums of bailouts and farm-loan waivers peddled by past Indian governments. Prime Minister Modi deserves accolades for launching the opening salvo against the agriculture license raj.<br />Nathan Punwani<br />Los Angeles</td>

He ponders whether this “trend” is real—but Mr. Riley needn’t look far for clarity.<br />That very same Times piece includes a poll from EdNext that found parents’ opinions of teachers’ unions have become more favorable during the pandemic. It also cites a poll from EdChoice that found that two-thirds of parents felt teachers unions had a “helpful” impact on student learning. Mr. Riley could have also noted a poll released last week from HuffPost/YouGov that showed far more parents of children in K-12 schools approve of how unions are handling the pandemic than disapprove.<br />The truth is no one knows better than teachers the limitations and deficiencies of remote learning. And no one has worked harder than teachers to secure the resources to safely reopen buildings. While charter schools remain closed, traditional public schools—in New York, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco—are reopening with protocols in place to mitigate virus transmission. This isn’t a binary choice: both in-school learning and safety are important. But rather than solve problems, Mr. Riley would prefer to embark on a fresh round of teacher bashing that has fallen out of favor with politicians and the public at large.<br />Randi Weingarten<br />President</td>

He played down the first-quarter results so far, saying they were “nothing more than what we see typically at the start of a new year.”<br />GE shares, recently up 10 cents to $11.83, are up 78% in the past six months as the company has posted improving results.<br />The Boston company booked $4.4 billion of cash flow in the fourth quarter, resulting in cash flow coming in positive by about $600 million for the full year.

The company wasn’t sure if the deals that helped boost results at the end of 2020 would close in time or if they would land in the first quarter instead, he said.</td>

      <td>For decades, Iran has built and operated a network of loyal armed groups around the Middle East that seek to expand Tehran’s military footprint and gain political influence in the region.<br />These groups often operate under the direction of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Founded after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the Revolutionary Guard seeks to defend the Iranian state and advance the model of Shiite Islam that underpinned the revolution.<br />This network of militias was long overseen by Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian commander of the Guards’ foreign wing, the Quds Force, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in January 2020. In recent years, Washington has accused several Iran-backed militias of killing American service members and has designated some as terrorist organizations.<br />In the wake of Gen. Soleimani’s death, new groups have emerged in Iraq, claiming responsibility for attacks targeting American interests. Not much is known about these groups, but many are believed to be splinters of bigger, long-established factions using new names in an attempt to shield their identity.<br />On Monday, a little-known Shiite militia group named the Guardians of the Blood Brigade claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on the U.S.-led coalition in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan, that killed a contractor and injured several others, including a U.S. service member.

      <td>A New York judge Tuesday dismissed the case against Amy Cooper, the white woman who falsely accused a Black bird-watcher of threatening her life, after Ms. Cooper completed a racial-education and therapy program.<br />In July, the Manhattan district attorney’s office charged Ms. Cooper with falsely reporting an incident in the third degree following a viral video of her calling the police in May on Christian Cooper, a bird-watcher who had asked that Ms. Cooper leash her dog in Central Park, as required by the park’s rules. Ms. Cooper, who isn’t related to Mr. Cooper, told the bird-watcher she would call the police and tell them “there’s an African-American man threatening my life.”<br />Prosecutors said Ms. Cooper told the police that Mr. Cooper tried to assault her and her dog, which wasn’t true.<br />Mr. Cooper’s video of his encounter with Ms. Cooper was cited as evidence that Black people often face law-enforcement scrutiny for everyday behavior.<br />During a court hearing Tuesday, Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi asked Judge Anne Swern to dismiss the case. “We offered her, consistent with our position on many misdemeanor cases involving a first arrest, an alternative, restorative justice resolution; designed not just to punish but to educate and promote community healing,” Ms. Illuzzi told the judge, according to remarks provided by the district attorney’s office.</td>

      <td>The proposed legislation heads to the French Senate amid criticism that it stigmatizes Muslims</td>
      <td>PARIS—France’s National Assembly approved a bill Tuesday that aims to strengthen government oversight of mosques and religious schools and crack down on other practices—from online hate speech to forced marriage—that President Emmanuel Macron says are rooted in Islamist separatism.<br />The proposed legislation passed the National Assembly, or lower house of Parliament, with a vote of 347-151, garnering support from lawmakers in Mr. Macron’s ranks as well as other centrist parties. It now heads to the Senate.<br />Mr. Macron and his supporters in Parliament have framed the bill as a response to the spread of “Islamist separatism,” which the president describes as an ideology that aims to build a parallel society in France where religious rules override civil laws. That ideology, the Macron government says, undermines the values of the French Republic—liberty, equality and fraternity—as well as laïcité, France’s strict separation of religion and state.<br />The proposed legislation requires religious associations and mosques to declare foreign funding of more than €10,000 ($12,000), and to sign a pledge to respect France’s republican values to receive state subsidies. The bill would also make it easier for the government to shut down mosques, associations and schools that are found criticizing republican values.<br />The proposed legislation would make it a criminal offense for anyone, in the name of ideology or religious extremism, to put pressure on civil servants and public-service providers to deviate from France’s secular values. Under its provisions, a man who refuses to allow a male doctor to examine his wife could face up to five years in jail and a fine of up to €75,000.</td>

      <td>Renewable energy and market design are easy targets during electricity failures but they are inadequate explanations</td>
      <td>Rolling blackouts in Texas during a historic winter storm are inviting scrutiny of everything from the grid’s reliance on wind energy to laissez-faire market design. The answer is actually quite simple: Texas isn’t used to the cold.<br />Just as observers blamed high solar penetration for California’s electricity blackouts last year, Texas’s bounty of wind power has been an easy target. Yet Texas counts on wind to meet only 10% of its winter capacity, according to the state’s  grid manager. Natural gas and coal make up the lion’s share, comprising 82%. Sure, some wind turbines glitched under cold weather conditions, but so did natural gas- and coal-fired power. That is partly because water intake facilities froze for these generators, just as they did in the last extreme winter seen in February 2011. At least some natural gas had to be redirected for heating rather than power, adding to the supply shortage.<br />Another point of criticism is market design. While other regional markets are designed to reward power plants for being on standby in case of unexpected demand peaks, Texas’s approach is fairly market-driven. That has meant the state historically has had a smaller cushion of electricity when demand has peaked, but this is no longer a problem.<br />Reserve margins—excess electricity generation capacity over demand—were dangerously low in 2018 and 2019 but bounced to 10.6% in 2020 and are expected to hit 15.5% in 2021. They clearly aren’t to blame in this winter storm’s failure: Winter peak demand hit a record 69,150 megawatts over the weekend, but up to 34,000 megawatts of supply were taken offline. Texas had no problem meeting a higher summer peak demand, which was 7% higher last year than this winter event.<br />Solutions will have to be nuanced and incremental. Winterizing all power plants would be unnecessarily expensive, and so would a complete overhaul of Texas’s market design, which is partly responsible for consistently low power prices compared with the rest of the country.</td>

      <td>Democrats want to impose federal rules on elections for president. Congress doesn’t have that power.</td>
      <td>House Democrats have made election “reform” their top legislative priority. House Resolution 1, styled the For the People Act, would vitiate existing state election laws, federalize the rules of congressional and presidential elections, and effectively do the same for state elections, which are often conducted on the same ballot. Critics have noted that the proposed rules are designed to benefit Democrats. They’re also unconstitutional.<br />The key problem is that the Constitution doesn’t give Congress the authority to regulate all federal elections in the same way. Congress has significant power over congressional elections. The Elections Clause of Article I, Section 4 provides that state legislatures “shall prescribe” the “times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,” but also authorizes Congress to “make or alter such regulations.”<br />Yet Congress has only limited authority over the conduct of presidential elections. They are governed by the Electors Clause in Article II, Section 1, which provides: “Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the United States.” Congress’s timing determination is binding on the states, as the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held last year in Carson v. Simon, which rejected Minnesota’s modification of its ballot-receipt deadline. (The Honest Elections Project sponsored the litigation, and Mr. Rivkin was the plaintiffs’ lead attorney.)<br />But the Electors Clause gives state legislatures plenary power over the manner of selecting presidential electors. It does not permit lawmakers to promulgate a comprehensive federal elections code. Nor does the 15th Amendment, which bars racial discrimination in voting, or the other amendments extending the franchise. Each grants Congress the power to enforce its guarantees through “appropriate legislation.” But as the Supreme Court explained in City of Boerne v. Flores (1997), “Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is.” None of these amendments guarantee the right to vote in any particular way—such as by mail versus in person—so Congress can’t rightly be said to be enforcing them through H.R.1. And none of them repeal the Electors Clause.<br />Although all 50 state legislatures have provided for popular election of presidential electors, the legislatures could change state law and appoint electors directly. H.R.1 violates the Electors Clause on its face, purporting to govern not merely the time, place and manner of congressional elections, but also regulating presidential elections in exactly the same prescriptive matter as congressional elections.</td>

      <td>The world is watching how he responds to an attack on U.S. forces.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden has said his Presidency won’t be a third Obama term, and he’ll have plenty of opportunities to prove it. The latest comes after a rocket attack against the U.S.-led coalition in Erbil, Iraq.<br />“Initial reports indicate that the attacks killed one civilian contractor and injured several members of the Coalition, including one American service member and several American contractors,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday. He added that he had told the leader of Kurdistan’s regional government that Washington would help “to investigate and hold accountable those responsible.” America’s adversaries will be watching, especially in Tehran.<br />An investigation is under way, but it’s hard to believe a Shiite militia allied with Iran isn’t behind the attack. The group Awliya Al Dam, or Guardians of Blood, has claimed responsibility. U.S. and Iraqi officials say smaller organizations like this have been linked to better known Iranian proxies such as Kataib Hezbollah. SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks extremist groups’ online activity, reports that Awliya Al Dam has vowed more violence after the latest incident.<br />Iranian proxies launched several rocket attacks on U.S. and allied forces in 2019 and 2020. Their goal is to drive out the roughly 2,500 U.S. troops that assist the Iraqi military, provide intelligence against a return of Islamic State, and limit malign Iranian influence in the country. Retaliatory strikes won’t put a complete stop to such aggression, but the right retaliation can degrade the militias’ abilities. Inaction could invite more brazen attacks.<br />Before Donald Trump ordered the retaliatory attack on Iranian terror chief Qasem Soleimani in January 2020, many warned such a response would lead to a full-scale war. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei tweeted that Mr. Trump “can’t do anything.” Mr. Biden doesn’t need to escalate to Mr. Trump’s level, but it’s worth reminding Tehran that he isn’t Barack Obama—and the U.S. can do something.</td>

      <td>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a stinging speech immediately after President Trump was acquitted in his Senate trial over the weekend. The speech has been seen as the opening salvo in Mr. McConnell’s effort to marginalize Mr. Trump’s influence in the Republican Party. It will be an uphill battle.<br />A Quinnipiac survey released on Monday found that only 11% of Republicans held Mr. Trump responsible for inciting the violence on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6. A mere 9% supported conviction. Only 16% would support even the symbolic rebuke of a censure motion. Not only do 87% of Republicans believe Mr. Trump should be allowed to hold office again; 75% want him to play a “prominent role” in the Republican Party.<br />What does such a role entail? A recent Gallup survey found that 68% of Republicans want the former president to remain their party’s leader. According to an Axios-Ipsos poll, 66% of Republicans believe that their party is better with Mr. Trump in it, and 57% favor him as their party’s 2024 presidential candidate. These sentiments may change over time. But for now, efforts to weaken Mr. Trump’s influence within the party will not succeed.<br />If anything, the opposite seems more likely. State and county Republican Party organizations across the country are censuring elected officials who broke with Mr. Trump to support his impeachment in the House and conviction in the Senate. The Trump base has anathematized even Trump loyalists such as former Vice President Mike Pence, who honored their oath of office. These supporters will not countenance anything short of unswerving fealty to Mr. Trump.<br />No doubt there are differences within the Republican Party between Trump supporters and party regulars. According to NBC, 87% of Trump supporters have “very positive” views of the former president, a sentiment shared by only 44% of party regulars.</td>

President Biden had earlier extended the moratorium, which had been set to expire at the end of January, until the end of March in a series of executive actions on his first day in office.<br />The Biden administration also said it would give homeowners more time—through June 30—to enroll in a program to request a pause or a reduction in mortgage payments.<br />The federal Cares Act signed into law last March by former President Donald Trump let borrowers postpone payments on federally backed mortgages for as long as 12 months.<br />Homeowners will now be able to receive up to six months of additional mortgage payment forbearance, in increments of three months, for those borrowers who entered forbearance before June 30, 2020, the White House said. Borrowers who enter into such plans can skip payments if they suffer a pandemic-related hardship but have to make them up later.</td>

      <td>Marriott International Inc.  Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson, who created the world’s largest hotel operator by acquiring Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. in 2016, died Monday. He was 62.<br />A Lutheran missionary’s son who was born in Japan and grew up in Minnesota, he became CEO of Marriott in 2012 and was the first person outside the founding family to head the hotel company. He was diagnosed with stage 2 pancreatic cancer in May 2019 but continued to serve as CEO.<br />The $13 billion acquisition of Starwood created a colossus with 30 brands—including Ritz-Carlton, Courtyard, W Hotels, Westin and Sheraton—and operations in more than 110 countries. Marriott prevailed over rival bidders including  Hyatt Hotels Corp.  and China’s Anbang Insurance Group Co.<br />Marriott coveted Starwood partly to gain more leverage with online travel agents and persuade them to take a smaller cut when customers choose a Marriott brand. Adding more brand choices might also induce more customers to go directly to Marriott’s website, cutting out the middlemen. “We think there are real advantages to size,” Mr. Sorenson told The Wall Street Journal when the purchase was completed.<br />Marriott said Tuesday that Stephanie Linnartz, the group president for consumer operations, technology and emerging businesses, and Tony Capuano, the group president for global development, design and operations services, will share responsibility for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the company. The two had assumed those duties when Mr. Sorenson stepped back earlier in the month.</td>

The total market value of bitcoin in circulation rose to $940 billion. Bitcoin later receded from its high, recently trading near $48,962.<br />The $50,000 level is an “emotional level for people in the space,” said Brian Melville, head of strategy at trading firm Cumberland.

The firm calculated that about 359,000 bitcoins were bought in the same period, and that imbalance has continued in 2021. “It’s a really important metric to watch,” he added.<br />That buying demand has brought not only a price rally, but growing acceptance and recognition of an asset that was once an object of derision for regulators and lawmakers.</td>

      <td>Competing acquisition offers for Coherent have pushed laser maker’s valuation to decade high</td>
      <td>Whoever ends up buying  Coherent  may have some explaining to do.<br />In a raging bull market that has left few apparent bargains to be had, the maker of laser components used in OLED displays, semiconductor manufacturing and many other applications likely looked like a steal. Its stock price had slumped 10% last year as sales continued their slide since late 2018. John Marchetti of Stifel downgraded the company following its fiscal year-end results in November, predicting a transition year ahead with limited upside as the company planned to expand its markets.<br />But in less than a month’s time, Coherent has gone from not to hot. The company landed its third acquisition offer in as many weeks on Friday.  II-VI Inc. —pronounced two-six—offered a cash-and-stock deal valuing Coherent at $260 a share. That was just days after  MKS Instruments  offered $240 a share in cash and stock, which itself topped a bid worth about $226 a share from  Lumentum Holdings  that Coherent agreed to on Jan. 19. Even the lowest of those bids values Coherent’s stock at its highest price since early 2018.<br />Coherent said Monday its board has decided to engage in discussions with II-VI, while it also evaluates the offer from MKS. It has yet to change its formal recommendation to shareholders approving the deal with Lumentum. Per the original agreement, Coherent would owe Lumentum a termination fee of $217.6 million if it calls off that deal in favor of another offer.<br />Any further offers would be in thin air. The current round of bids values the shares between 34 and 40 times forward earnings—a multiple Coherent hasn’t commanded since 2009, according to FactSet. That has cast a pall on all of the bidders. Lumentum’s share price fell nearly 17% between the date of the announced deal and the competing offer from MKS on Monday. MKS shares fell 8% when that company announced its own offer, while II-VI shares fell nearly 10% on Friday. Shares of Lumentum and II-VI—the two bidders most likely to succeed—were still down well below their preannouncement levels Monday morning.</td>

Relief measures cushioned the blow to consumers and businesses. But as vaccines are administered and countries start to loosen restrictions, the removal of support could expose weak points in the economy and hamper any bounce back.<br />“Withdrawing fiscal support too soon could exacerbate the effects of the economic crisis and put financial stability at risk,” said Claudia Buch, vice president of the German central bank and chair of the ESRB’s working group. “Maintaining fiscal support for too long would increase budgetary pressures” for governments and potentially foster the creation of zombie companies, she added.</td>

Then, during the fourth-quarter earnings presentation in late January, Chief Executive David Calhoun all but confirmed that the company’s next jet would indeed address the “middle of the market” between long international flights and short-haul domestic ones.<br />This appears to end speculation that Boeing could prioritize a replacement for the troubled 737 MAX, which is now flying again. It is a good call not to undermine MAX sales with talk of a substitute.<br />Last week, the buzz increased after trade journal Aviation Week reported that the new jet could instead be a two-aisle model, reviving the so-called New Midsize Airplane project that Boeing abandoned when Mr. Calhoun took over last year. This time, though, the program wouldn’t just have two variants seating 225 and 275 people, but also a third, smaller one.<br />Boeing has been here before. In 1982, it addressed the middle of the market with its 757 and 767 models. But the 200-seat 757 turned out to be too far ahead of its time: It never gained popularity, only ever finding a place as a repurposed trans-Atlantic jet in the 1990s.</td>

It owns labels including Atlantic, Elektra and its flagship Warner Records, as well as Warner Chappell Music, the world’s third-largest music publisher.</td>

He pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to the charges brought by the Financial Conduct Authority.<br />His brother, Suhail Zina, 33 years old and a former lawyer at Clifford Chance LLP, didn’t enter a plea and his lawyer declined to comment. Both were released on bail.<br />A Goldman Sachs spokesman said protecting client information is of paramount importance and that the bank isn’t part of the proceedings.

      <td>Small-business formation is surging in the U.S., and e-commerce company  Shopify Inc.  has been reaping the gains of that business boom.<br />More Americans are opening online stores and selling goods and services to make money as the effects of the pandemic have wiped out jobs and disrupted in-person activities like dining and shopping. The shift has brought a wave of new business to Shopify, which sells subscription services that enable people to put up websites, accept online payments, and ship and track orders to customers.<br />But Shopify’s business model carries risks. Analysts expect the surge in e-commerce that drove much of the company’s growth to taper as the pandemic ebbs. “There could be a material deceleration in sales growth,” said Tom Forte, an analyst with DA Davidson.<br />Another risk: Many of the startups that use Shopify’s services are more likely to fail than grow meaningfully, said Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “How can you get capital, and how do you scale up in this kind of environment and this kind of uncertainty?” he said.<br />Most of Shopify’s more than one million customers are first-time entrepreneurs, said Harley Finkelstein, president of the Ottawa-based company, which will report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. “Imagine a future where everyone is an entrepreneur. We’re moving in that direction,” he said.</td>

Tony Evers and the Republican-controlled legislature have had a running feud over mask mandates and other restrictions for much of the past year, triggering multiple lawsuits.<br />The state’s two largest cities—the Democratic strongholds of Milwaukee and Madison—have implemented tighter restrictions on bars and restaurants, while those outside the urban centers have faced fewer limitations. Some establishments along the state’s borders with Minnesota and Illinois, where rules are more stringent, have actually seen a boost in business.<br />In the most recent episode of dueling moves by the governor and legislature, Wisconsin residents experienced whiplash Feb. 4 when within the course of about an hour the state went from having a mask mandate, to not having one, to having one again.<br />“There is an inability to reach an agreement and move things forward,” said Charles Franklin, director of a statewide poll conducted by Marquette Law School. “What we have seen for almost a year now is legislative opposition to some of the governor’s actions, but then the legislature has not advanced its own proposal.”</td>

She was also accused of a second offense under a natural disaster management law, which has been applied in Myanmar against those who break pandemic-linked restrictions, the lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said.<br />Mr. Zaw wasn’t informed of the second allegation until he was briefed by the judge after the video proceedings, he said. A police spokesman didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />Protesters have been demanding for days that Ms. Suu Kyi, who commands immense popularity and was detained in her house in the capital, Naypyitaw, during the Feb. 1 coup, be set free. The coup ended a decadelong shift toward democracy, putting the military—which ruled for half a century before the transition—back in absolute control. Faced with international pressure and large street demonstrations, the generals have doubled down in recent days.<br />For the last two nights, they ordered near-total internet blackouts. In a show of force, tanks showed up in the streets of Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, on Sunday and Monday. Protesters familiar with military rule live in terror of nightly raids and arrests. Some neighborhoods have assembled teams to keep a watch and alert residents if security forces are sighted.</td>

They closed at 10,420 yen, equivalent to $98.96, which was almost double their price a year ago, and topped the old split-adjusted record of ¥10,111.1.<br />Much about the  SoftBank  of two decades ago would look familiar to investors today, starting with its guiding principle of betting big on the next tech revolution. Then, as now, global stock markets were on a tear, startups were listing at eye-popping prices, and SoftBank was building a huge stable of private companies.<br />“Structurally, we’re at the beginning of the AI [artificial intelligence] revolution, just as we were at the beginning of the internet revolution” in 2000, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said at a press conference in Tokyo last week where the company reported around $11 billion in quarterly profit.<br />The differences are important, too. Analysts say today’s SoftBank, known for its $100 billion Vision Fund, is more capable of withstanding market turbulence, even if stocks take a dive again.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—Nine veteran pro-democracy activists appeared together in court Tuesday on charges related to the mass protests that rocked the city in 2019, in a trial that stands out for the number and prominence of the defendants facing prosecution.<br />They include 82-year-old pro-democracy campaigner Martin Lee, newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai and seven others who face charges of illegal assembly that carry possible sentences of up to five years in prison.<br />While the prosecution of Hong Kong’s opposition has become increasingly commonplace, the defendants in the trial beginning Tuesday are a Who’s Who of an earlier generation of activists who have been fighting for core issues like the rule of law and political participation since before the U.K. returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.<br />Mr. Lee is a U.K.-trained lawyer who co-founded the city’s first pro-democracy party and helped write Hong Kong’s foundational legal document, the 1990 Basic Law. Others charged include Margaret Ng, a 73-year-old barrister; Albert Ho, a 69-year-old lawyer and activist; Lee Cheuk-yan, a 64-year-old labor leader, and Leung Kwok-hung, also 64, a longtime politician and activist known as “Long Hair.”<br />Police arrested the group last April in coordinated early-morning raids that surprised many in the city, since those targeted were generally associated with peaceful activism and running for elected office—not the often bitter clashes between young protesters and the police. For many, the arrests signaled that authorities intended to go beyond prosecuting protesters who committed violence to crush the democracy movement itself.</td>

There is also mounting evidence that some strains might be less susceptible to the vaccines currently authorized in the region, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.<br />The variant first identified in Britain accounted for 96% of viral samples examined at three major laboratories in England by early February, compared with just over a third at the beginning of December, according to the U.K. government.</td>

      <td>Crude prices have made up their pandemic losses, but further gains are clouded by questions regarding where all the excess barrels went</td>
      <td>Oil is on the move: Both Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices have broken the $60-a-barrel mark, taking the commodity’s price back to where it was before the pandemic. But a mystery still casts a cloud over its recovery.<br />The unsolved question has to do with what is commonly referred to as the case of missing barrels, or the amount of oil that is unaccounted for by the International Energy Agency. It is a mystery that resurfaces every couple of years, particularly when there is a shock in energy markets.<br />In the first half of 2020, for example, the IEA determined that, based on its estimate of oil supply and demand, there was a global inventory increase of 1.39 billion barrels. Out of this, it observed that roughly a quarter had gone into spare storage in countries that are part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, while 8% was in floating storage and in transit. The remaining 68% was unaccounted for.<br />There is always some oil that isn’t tracked, but the number has been growing in more recent oil-market shocks. Last year’s reached a record: The volume of missing barrels in the first half of 2020 was the largest recorded gap between observed and implied inventories since at least 1990, according to an analysis from Bassam Fattouh, Andreas Economou and Michal Meidan of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. In fact, it was almost 10 times as large as the imbalance seen in the second half of 2008 when the global financial crisis hit.<br />One common explanation for the discrepancy is that these barrels simply don’t exist and that it reflects imprecise measurement. Demand is observed with lags, and supply is observed imprecisely, particularly from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, as the Oxford Institute report notes. “The IEA collects data from the governments. So if the government data is off, they’re off,” notes energy economist Philip Verleger. He suggests that the jump in missing barrels could be due to rather mundane reasons: More employees have been laid off or are working from home during the pandemic, which could have led to flawed data collection from primary sources. If true, it is a potentially bullish scenario for oil prices—it means there is much less crude out there than thought.</td>

      <td>Regulation beefs up consumer protection on retirement accounts</td>
      <td>The Labor Department said late last week that it will build upon a Trump administration regulation governing advice that affects the trillions of dollars in retirement accounts, rather than replace it.<br />The measure, which goes into effect Tuesday, will cause many rollovers, in which hundreds of billions of dollars move annually from 401(k)s to individual retirement accounts, to be more heavily regulated. It also gives investors who feel they have been given bad rollover advice the right to file a lawsuit or arbitration claim.<br />Because investment fees tend to be lower in 401(k) plans than in IRAs, “financial firms have a strong incentive to get you to move money out of your 401(k) plan into an IRA, where they can manage it more profitably,” said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America.<br />“This is a signal from the Labor Department that they are going to continue to beef up consumer protections to ensure rollover recommendations are really in consumers’ best interests,” she said.<br />The regulation also will hold advisers to IRA owners to a higher standard when it comes to managing conflicts of interest, including those that arise in the sale of products such as variable annuities that pay commissions or other sales incentives, said Fred Reish, a lawyer who specializes in employee benefits.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is reviewing U.S. policy toward a pipeline designed to carry Russian natural gas to Germany beneath the Baltic Sea, under new pressure after construction on the $11 billion project resumed this month, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.<br />The undersea pipeline, Nord Stream 2, is more than 90% completed, with about 100 miles remaining. Construction resumed in earnest on Feb. 6, more than a year after it came to a halt in the face of opposition from the Trump administration and acts of Congress authorizing sanctions on companies and individuals involved in the project. The Biden administration hasn’t thus far imposed sanctions required by law.<br />The Biden administration has opened talks with Berlin on the future of the pipeline, including “threats of sanctions against companies involved in the construction of Nord Stream 2,” a German official said.<br />The administration on Tuesday faces a deadline to report a list of companies it deems in violation of the U.S. laws aimed at halting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Those companies would be potential targets for U.S. sanctions. The Biden administration could also waive the application of sanctions under a national-interest clause, placating Germany, a critical European ally, handing Russia a geopolitical victory, and crossing a bipartisan coalition in Congress.<br />“The arrival of Russian infrastructure into a NATO country puts all NATO members at risk,” wrote Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.), one of the principal authors of the sanctions legislation, and Jim Risch (R., Idaho), the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to the White House on Friday. “The U.S. relationship with Germany is a cornerstone of the transatlantic alliance. But allowing the completion of Nord Stream II is not a constructive path forward for this partnership.”</td>

      <td>Lumber prices have shot to fresh records, defying the normal winter slowdown in wood-product sales in a sign that the pandemic building boom is bowling into 2021.<br />Records have been set across species, products and grades, according to pricing service Random Lengths. It has never cost more to buy oriented strand board, known as OSB and used for walls, Southern yellow pine, which is favored for fences and decks, or ponderosa pine, which is popular in cabinetry and interior trim.<br />Many engineered wood products used in new construction, such as I-joists, are in short supply, and mills are backlogged with orders well into March, the pricing service said. Last week, its Random Lengths Framing Lumber Composite price rose to $966 per thousand board feet, exceeding the $955 high set in September.<br />Lumber futures have climbed 47% over the past three weeks, to within a few dollars of records set in September. Lumber for March delivery ended trading Friday at $982.10 per thousand board feet, more than twice the price a year earlier.<br />Many buyers have jostled into contracts for May delivery, which ended Friday at $830.90. The cheapest and most distant futures, for lumber in March 2022, start at $695, which is more than the pre-pandemic record of $639.</td>

But some investors say they are being compensated well for the risk—and Chinese companies are still less likely to run into financial trouble than their American counterparts.<br />As of Monday, yields on an ICE BofA index of Chinese offshore high-yield corporate bonds stood at 9.18%, a roughly 4.5-percentage-point premium over U.S. yields. That gulf has largely been driven by a rally pushing down U.S. yields and contrasts with an average difference over the last 10 years of 2.15 percentage point.<br />At the same time, about 2.5% of Chinese offshore high-yield debt by face value is likely to default this year, according to forecasts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. credit analysts led by SooChong Lim. The bank’s equivalent U.S. forecast is 3.5%.<br />“China high-yield is extremely cheap versus U.S. high-yield,” said Jean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging-markets fixed income for BNP Paribas Asset Management.</td>

For considerable periods over the past 32 years, an investor saving around 10,000 Japanese yen, the equivalent of about $95, per month would have been better off having kept it all in cash.<br />But right now, that stock investor would be sitting relatively pretty. A 10,000 Japanese yen investment in the MSCI Japan stock index each month since December 1989 would now be worth around 7.7 million yen—against around 4.4 million yen for the same money in a bank account offering a 1% interest rate.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—As ships with its coal remain stranded at sea because of a diplomatic dispute between Australia and China,  BHP Group Ltd.  showed another side of the trade relationship with its best underlying profit in seven years as it rode a rally in iron-ore prices.<br />BHP reported a $6.04 billion profit before exceptional items for the six months through December, up 16% compared with a year ago, as China’s big bet on infrastructure spending to drive its economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic stoked demand for iron ore. The company also declared a record half-year dividend of $1.01 a share.<br />Prices of iron ore, used to make steel, recently surged to a nine-year high of $176.90 a metric ton. That is well above the cost of roughly $10 to $20 a ton that most global miners incur in digging the commodity out of the ground.<br />For BHP, the higher price for iron ore, as well as for copper, helped to offset lower prices for crude oil and steelmaking coal. During the half-year period, BHP’s average realized price of iron ore jumped 33% year over year, and copper was up 28%.<br />Still, BHP’s statutory net profit fell by 20% to $3.88 billion in the half, from $4.87 billion a year earlier. The result was dragged down by exceptional charges totaling $2.16 billion, led by an impairment of BHP’s energy-coal assets and associated tax losses. Other charges were tied to the pandemic and BHP’s Samarco joint venture with Brazil’s  Vale SA,  which recently restarted operations after a 2015 fatal dam collapse.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, facing the prospect of campaigns from the pro-Trump wing of the Republican party, signaled his willingness to get involved in primary elections to improve the party’s chances of regaining control of the chamber in the next round of elections in 2022.<br />The key to GOP chances of retaking the Senate is “getting candidates who can actually win in November,” Mr. McConnell said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. “That may or may not involve trying to affect the outcome of the primaries.”<br />The carefully chosen phrasing reflects Mr. McConnell’s difficult balancing act as a de facto party leader after the party’s one-time standard-bearer, former President Donald Trump, lost the White House in November elections, and roiled the political world with unfounded assertions that the election was stolen. Extreme elements of Mr. Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, leading to an impeachment trial of the former president.<br />Mr. Trump, who was acquitted, is still enormously popular among many Republican voters. To regain power, Mr. McConnell must tap the considerable energy the Trump movement brings to the party while weeding out any extreme candidates that he worries would have little chance of winning a general election, despite support from Mr. Trump.<br />Some Republicans who are squarely in the Trump wing of the party might easily win even a general election in deeply conservative areas. But such candidates risk complicating the party’s efforts elsewhere in more moderate areas of the country. If Mr. McConnell moves too aggressively against a pro-Trump candidate he deems too close to the fringes of the party, he could invite a backlash from the base.</td>

Gen. Russel Honoré to lead a review of the security infrastructure, interagency processes, and command and control. In a letter to House members on Monday she said, “It is clear from his findings and from the impeachment trial that we must get to the truth of how this happened.”<br />The commission could satisfy Democrats who want to see Mr. Trump and others held to greater account for the Jan. 6 riot after the former president was acquitted Saturday in a Senate impeachment trial. Seven Republicans joined all 50 Democrats in voting to find Mr. Trump guilty of inciting the insurrection. That fell short of the 67 Senate votes needed to convict.<br />Some Democrats, however, have suggested—as did Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell in a blistering speech about Mr. Trump after Saturday’s vote—that the best venue is outside Congress.<br />“I think there’s grounds for further proceedings, both civil and criminal, against former President Trump,” Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos,” noting he supports a 9/11-style commission.</td>

American citizens tried to use terrorism to stop a democratic proceeding they disliked.<br />There is no question former President Trump bears moral responsibility. His supporters stormed the Capitol because of the unhinged falsehoods he shouted into the world’s largest megaphone. His behavior during and after the chaos was also unconscionable, from attacking Vice President Mike Pence during the riot to praising the criminals after it ended.<br />I was as outraged as any member of Congress. But senators take our own oaths. Our job wasn’t to find some way, any way, to inflict a punishment. The Senate’s first and foundational duty was to protect the Constitution.<br />Some brilliant scholars believe the Senate can try and convict former officers. Others don’t. The text is unclear, and I don’t begrudge my colleagues their own conclusions. But after intense study, I concluded that Article II, Section 4 limits impeachment and conviction to current officers.<br />Everyone agrees that “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors” exhaust the valid grounds for conviction. It follows that the list of persons in that sentence—“the president, vice president, and all civil officers”—likewise exhausts its valid subjects.</td>

      <td>Washington was a savvy packager of his own personal virtues. He knew that if you don’t engage in a bit of self-aggrandizement, you lose.</td>
      <td>Playacting is a necessary part of democratic politics, for good and ill. Just as a great actor by definition doesn’t appear to be acting, the successful politician must convince other people of his own virtue and competence without appearing to be concerned with what people think of him. To put the point brutally, you can’t win elections if you’re unable or unwilling to tell people, or somehow to communicate to them, how great you are.<br />I have often thought the great exception to this rule must be George Washington. He did not seek the presidency of the new republic but had to be implored to fill it. I was wrong. The nation’s first president, as David O. Stewart shows in “George Washington: The Political Rise of America’s Founding Father,” carefully cultivated his reputation with the aim of winning preferment at every stage of his adult life. Washington, writes Mr. Stewart at the midpoint of his subject’s public career, “had captured the holy grail for public actors, operating as a politician with extraordinary success while at the same time not seeming to be one at all, with all the negative baggage that the label has always carried.” After 16 years as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses and six as a county magistrate and town trustee, “almost no one thought of him as a political operator, nor would they in the future.”<br />I was prepared to dislike the book. What I suspected was that Mr. Stewart would present Washington as a canny careerist who failed upward—that is, who escaped accountability for his mistakes and rose to the top of Revolution-era political life by means of charm and guile. Again I was wrong. The book is nothing like that. Mr. Stewart has written an outstanding biography that both avoids hagiography and acknowledges the greatness of Washington’s character, all while paying close attention to his rarely voiced but no less fierce political ambitions. He does not flinch from the cruelty of American slavery and Washington’s part in it, but situates him in the time and place of his origins rather than in ours. Mr. Stewart’s writing is clear, often superlative, his judgments are nuanced, and the whole has a narrative drive such a life deserves.<br />Washington was not excessively handsome (although to be fair he was far better looking in his youth and middle age than the famous Gilbert Stuart portrait suggests) but his mien and gait were legendary. Innumerable contemporaries remarked on his graceful walk and gestures, which combined with his physical dimensions (six feet tall, broad shoulders) to make crowded rooms go quiet upon his entry. He refined that advantage by his attire: “In a memorandum for a tailor,” Mr. Stewart notes, “he specified the number of buttonholes in his coat, its length, and the width of the lapels.”<br />“The chief part of my happiness,” Washington wrote in 1755, “[is] the esteem and notice the country has been pleased to honor me with.” He had achieved that esteem and notice by his account—and an accurate account it was—of a battle in which his own side was defeated, partly as a result of Washington’s poor choice of ground, but in which he exhibited spectacular bravery and endurance. He met with little success in other battles of the French and Indian War, not always through his own fault, but he maintained an ability to inspire the troops under his command with trust and courage.</td>

It is also discovering that U.S. allies are not quite as happy with Mr. Biden’s Feb. 4 announcement that “America is back” as many Democrats might have hoped.<br />In Asia the administration’s Myanmar policy—imposing sanctions that signal displeasure without materially affecting the army’s ability to rule—has attracted little enthusiasm. On Feb 15, India’s foreign minister hailed Indo-Japanese cooperation on regional infrastructure projects that link Myanmar with its neighbors, a not-so-subtle signal that India intends to go on cooperating with Myanmar no matter what Washington wants. Simultaneously, the large portion of the Indian press that supports the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is aflame with resentment that Vice President Kamala Harris’s niece, Meena Harris, seems to be siding with protesters against BJP policies.<br />European leaders are also dismissive of American moralism. French President Emmanuel Macron denounced the importation of U.S.-academic and cultural wokeness as a threat to the French way of life, while pragmatists on the Continent are pushing to strengthen economic relations with Russia and China—virtually ignoring the Biden administration’s efforts to raise the pressure on human-rights abusers in Moscow and Beijing. With the U.S. trade representative’s recent announcement that Trump-era retaliatory tariffs on European wine, cheese and food imports aren’t going away soon, this has been one of the shortest and coldest diplomatic honeymoons on record.<br />In the Middle East, Iran is showing no eagerness to ease the administration’s path back into the 2015 nuclear deal. And both Israel and the conservative Arab states resent the American shift in that direction. As for restless NATO ally Turkey, Mr. Biden promised during the campaign to help President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s opposition. The new administration has so far criticized a crackdown on pro-LGBTQ student demonstrators and called on Ankara to release the dissident Osman Kavala.<br />Closer to home, the unceremonious cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline miffed Canadians. The Biden administration appears headed for a fight with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over deforestation in the Amazon basin—a sensitive issue for the Brazilian right. Mexico’s left-populist President Andrés Manuel López Obrador delayed congratulating Mr. Biden on his election, passed a law limiting U.S.-Mexican collaboration over drug trafficking, and offered political asylum to Julian Assange.</td>

      <td>Workers have more to fear from well-meaning pols than from capitalism.</td>
      <td>As these things always do, it started out with the best intentions. In January the City Council of Long Beach, Calif., adopted an ordinance requiring large grocery-store chains to pay employees an extra $4 an hour. The idea was to reward them for the risks they took by doing their jobs amid the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />It didn’t turn out that way. In response to the ordinance,  Kroger Co.  announced it would close two Long Beach supermarkets. Once again, workers were sacrificed to greed. As local union leader John Grant told the Washington Post, “it’s reckless capitalism run amok.”<br />But is it?<br />As one of the world’s largest retailers, Kroger makes an easy villain. But instead of blaming “reckless capitalism,” might the fault lie with the reckless politicians who passed this measure? Thanks to their intervention, instead of finding an extra $4 an hour in their paychecks, nearly 200 grocery workers will now have no paychecks at all unless they are transferred to another store or find another job. It’s but the latest illustration of economist Thomas Sowell’s dictum that whatever a government might set it at, “the real minimum wage is always zero.”<br />What happened to these workers is worth bearing in mind as Congress debates whether to raise the federal minimum wage. For though the Long Beach ordinance was called “hero pay” and meant to be temporary, it operated as a minimum-wage increase for the affected grocery workers. And just as the Long Beach City Council passed it unanimously and without much thought that it could end up doing more harm to these workers than good, those now pressing Congress to include the $15-an-hour federal minimum wage in its Covid-19 relief package ask us to believe the costs would be nonexistent or minimal.</td>

      <td>‘By far the most difficult challenge was reporting that Trump had gotten something right.’</td>
      <td>Alexander Nazaryan of Yahoo News writing for the Atlantic, Feb. 11:<br /><br />Covering the [Trump] administration was thrilling for many journalists, in the way that I imagine storming Omaha Beach must have been for a 20-year-old fresh from the plains of Kansas. He hadn’t signed up for battle, but there he was, liberating France. France, by the way, is where Trump called American soldiers who’d fallen in combat “suckers” and “losers.” When this magazine first reported those comments, Trump’s supporters denounced the Atlantic story as preposterous and offensive, even as outlet after outlet confirmed the reporting. They failed to realize that the preposterous and the offensive were the twin beacons of the Trump presidency. Journalists were merely going where he led. This was our Omaha Beach. . . .<br />By far the most difficult challenge was reporting that Trump had gotten something right. This had a surreal, faintly futile quality, like trying to narrate a traffic jam play by play. I am thinking, in particular, of Trump’s push to reopen schools throughout the spring and summer. The push was poorly thought-out, rushed, and ineffective. It was also worth fighting for, only woe to the journalist who argued as much, as the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof would discover. To simply point out that Trump had improbably managed to alight on the correct course of action was to have written a favorable profile of Osama bin Laden.</td>

Pilots involved in some of the accidents have expressed concern about potential problems affecting nose wheels.<br />All of the planes suffered damage after touching down on the runway, according to the NTSB spokesman; no fatalities or serious injuries were reported.<br />An informal group of M600 pilots involved in the accidents is pushing for government action, arguing the common link appears to be a nose-gear problem during otherwise normal touchdowns, causing the planes to veer from the center of the runway. Steering is controlled through pedals that also move the plane’s rudder, a vertical panel on the tail.<br />In two of the accidents, aviators at the controls said, efforts to control the direction of the nose failed as they careened off the strip, causing severe damage that resulted in scrapping aircraft that can cost about $3.5 million apiece.</td>

      <td>Study comparing two groups of 600,000 people also found vaccine recipients 92% less likely to develop severe illness</td>
      <td>TEL AVIV—New The latest data from Israel shows a 94% drop in symptomatic Covid-19 infections among 600,000 people who received two doses of  Pfizer  Inc.  and  BioNTech  SE’s vaccine, offering important new insights for other countries as they roll out their own campaigns.<br />The vaccinated group was also 92% less likely to develop severe illness from the disease, according to a study by Clalit, Israel’s largest healthcare provider. Clalit compared 600,000 people who got the shots with a group of the same size who didn’t in what was Israel’s largest vaccine study to date.<br />Clalit said the study, which was carried out with a team from Harvard University, included 430,000 people who were between 16 and 59 years of age, and 170,000 who were 60 or older. It was the first of its kind to show such a high level of efficacy for Pfizer’s vaccine for those aged 70 and over, due to the limited scope of the earlier clinical trials, according to the healthcare provider.<br />The study was done so that each vaccinated individual was tested against an unvaccinated person who had a similar profile, including their risk level for infection, risk level of developing serious illness and overall health.<br />“It is now unequivocal that Pfizer’s vaccine against the coronavirus is incredibly effective in real life one week after the second dose, just as was found in the clinical study,” said Ran Balicer, Clalit’s chief innovation officer and one of the study’s authors, in a Hebrew statement published Sunday with the study. The vaccine is even more effective two weeks after the second shot, he added.</td>

      <td>Health officials in Guinea are rushing to contain the first outbreak of the deadly Ebola disease in the region since 2016, days after authorities detected new cases of the hemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo, testing a continent that is already battling the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Guinea was one of the three most-affected countries during the 2014-2016 epidemic. The current outbreak began in late January, but was only identified as the Ebola virus on Sunday, health officials said, suggesting it may have spread substantially in the intervening weeks.<br />The outbreak four years ago left more than 11,000 dead across West Africa. The new outbreak comes as the continent grapples with a steady rise of coronavirus infection rates, driven at least in part by a more transmissible variant first detected in South Africa.<br />The outbreak also comes shortly after Congo, which has faced more Ebola outbreaks than any other nation in the world, also detected cases in the restive region of North Kivu. Health experts hope the availability of an Ebola vaccine will help bring the outbreak swiftly under control.<br />Guinea’s health minister Remy Lamah on Monday said the government was successfully identifying those at risk and was well prepared to combat a new resurgence. “The government calls upon the population in the affected areas to respect prevention measures,” he said.</td>

      <td>Power shortages show the folly of eliminating natural gas—and coal.</td>
      <td>Gas and power prices have spiked across the central U.S. while Texas regulators ordered rolling blackouts Monday as an Arctic blast has frozen wind turbines. Herein is the paradox of the left’s climate agenda: The less we use fossil fuels, the more we need them.<br />A mix of ice and snow swept across the country this weekend as temperatures plunged below zero in the upper Midwest and into the teens in Houston. Cold snaps happen—the U.S. also experienced a Polar Vortex in 2019—as do heat waves. Yet the power grid is becoming less reliable due to growing reliance on wind and solar, which can’t provide power 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<br />While Texas is normally awash in gas and oil, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees the state’s wholesale power market, urged residents this weekend to conserve power to avoid power outages. Regulators rationed gas for commercial and industrial uses to ensure fuel for power plants and household heating.<br />Texas’s energy emergency could last all week as the weather is forecast to remain frigid. “My understanding is, the wind turbines are all frozen,” Public Utility Commission Chairman DeAnn Walker said Friday. “We are working already to try and ensure we have enough power but it’s taken a lot of coordination.”<br />Blame a perfect storm of bad government policies, timing and weather. Coal and nuclear are the most reliable sources of power. But competition from heavily subsidized wind power and inexpensive natural gas, combined with stricter emissions regulation, has caused coal’s share of Texas’s electricity to plunge by more than half in a decade to 18%.</td>

      <td>Record label will be spun out of Vivendi by end of year—positive news for investors, with possible exception of Amsterdam listing</td>
      <td>The world’s largest music company is finally going solo, although not in the usual venue.<br />On Saturday, Universal Music Group’s French owner  Vivendi  said that it will spin off its music business and list it in the Netherlands later this year. It had already broached the idea of taking the record label that works with Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift public in 2022. Strong investor appetite for music assets since the pandemic began might explain the accelerated timeline. The news sent Vivendi’s share price up one-fifth on Monday.<br />Once the spinoff is complete, the French company steered by billionaire Vincent Bolloré will still hold one-fifth of Universal. Chinese tech giant  Tencent  will own 20% after recently exercising an option to up its stake in the music giant at a €30 billion—equivalent to $36 billion—valuation. The remaining 60% will be handed to Vivendi investors in a special distribution.<br />Shareholders have been pushing for the move as a way to unlock value in the music business for years. Vivendi’s shares have traded at an average discount of around 10% to its sum-of-the-parts valuation since late 2017, according to Barclays analysts. Soon, investors will be able to get exposure to Universal directly rather than having to buy shares in the sprawling French conglomerate.<br />Although organizers of live concerts are suffering during the pandemic, streaming services have benefited as consumers spend more time listening to music. Spotify grew its monthly active users to 345 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 27% increase compared with the same period a year earlier. Major record labels such as Universal and Warner are raking in more royalties from digital music platforms as a result. In the third quarter, Universal’s streaming revenue increased by 23%, the fastest growth it has recorded since early 2019.</td>

      <td>A group of mostly Western countries led by Canada have formed a coalition against the detention of foreign nationals for diplomatic leverage, taking aim at a practice that diplomats say has been used by Beijing and Tehran.<br />Fifty-eight nations, including the U.S., Japan, Australia and almost all members of the European Union, have signed a declaration that is nonbinding and has no tools for enforcement. The Canadian foreign ministry, which is launching the initiative publicly on Monday, says that it doesn’t target a single nation but is aimed at bringing diplomatic pressure to bear on the issue.<br />Canadian Foreign Minister Marc Garneau told reporters Sunday that he is seeking the support of other countries to join the effort to stop the “illegal and immoral” imprisonments. By joining with other nations, he said, “we believe we have a better chance of exerting pressure on those countries that do practice arbitrary detentions,” he said.<br />Western diplomats have accused China, Iran, Russia and North Korea in recent years of detaining foreign nationals as bargaining chips.<br />Officials from dozens of countries, including the U.S., U.K. and Germany spoke at a virtual conference hosted by Canada Monday morning to declare support for halting arbitrary detentions.</td>

      <td>A conventional letter grade for each course is recorded for every student at Reed College.</td>
      <td>Andy Kessler’s “Mediocrity Is Now Mandatory” (Inside View, Feb. 8) equates Reed College’s grading philosophy, which measures academic achievement by intellectual growth, with fragility and claims that Reed’s faculty “don’t even bother with meaningful grades.” Mr. Kessler cites the grading policy at Reed as evidence that diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives threaten to dethrone merit and promote a culture of mediocrity. This conjecture indicates a fundamental misunderstanding and mischaracterization of Reed’s approach to learning.<br />First, a conventional letter grade for each course is recorded for every student at Reed. In fact, Reed is renowned for an absence of grade inflation that reflects the rigor of our academic program and the high standards set by the faculty. This being said, it is true that letter grades are not shared with students unless requested. Instead, students receive robust ongoing feedback on their work, including lengthy comments on papers and exams. This practice fosters content proficiency, more creativity and intellectual curiosity, and stronger outcomes. Furthermore, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives actually lead to a more meritocratic society by giving more students access to top-quality education.<br />Demonstrating the power of our approach, Reed ranks fourth in the nation among colleges and universities in the percentage of graduates who go on to earn doctoral degrees. Bottom line, we know that when meeting the challenges of “real life,” the grades you received in college don’t matter if you didn’t learn the material.<br />Prof. Kathryn C.

      <td>JOHANNESBURG—The World Health Organization approved  AstraZeneca  PLC’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use on Monday, clearing the way for the first shipments of free vaccines in the West’s main effort to inoculate the world’s poorest nations.<br />Many developing countries rely on the WHO’s emergency-use listing—which signals that a vaccine is considered safe and effective and that its supply chain has been checked—to authorize the shots at home. It also triggers purchase orders that Covax, a WHO-supported initiative, made with vaccine manufacturers.<br />The Covax facility, which is financed mostly by Western governments and charitable groups such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, aims to supply some 2.27 billion vaccine doses this year to 145 countries, the majority free of charge. Doses produced by AstraZeneca and its manufacturing partners are expected to make up about a third of that effort, and more than half of the supply in the first half of the year.<br />“Today’s announcement…allows everybody to access vaccines,” said Deusdedit Mubangizi, who heads the WHO unit that approved the listing.<br />The initial approval covers doses produced by AstraZeneca and South Korea’s SK Bioscience. A separate emergency-use listing for the same shots made by the Serum Institute of India is expected to follow as early as Tuesday.</td>
