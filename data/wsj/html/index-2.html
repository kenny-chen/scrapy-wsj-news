      <td>Investigating the entire department will burden the crime-plagued city.</td>
      <td>Derek Chauvin awaits his murder sentence at a Minnesota Correctional Facility, yet the federal government spared hardly a moment before shifting its scrutiny toward his former colleagues. A new Justice Department probe of the Minneapolis Police Department is targeting the city’s officers in an effort to prove the Democratic narrative of “systemic” police racism.<br />Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday announced a pattern-or-practice investigation of Minneapolis police. Federal investigators in coming months will examine the department’s record and policing methods. If they find behavior they dislike, they have the power to force reform of the department through a consent decree. Mr. Garland referred to the process as a matter of straightforward oversight, saying “good officers welcome accountability.”<br />Yet Minneapolis police are right to suspect that Washington is probing them with a foregone conclusion. In his address after Mr. Chauvin’s conviction Tuesday, President Biden said his Administration’s next step would be “confronting head-on systemic racism and the racial disparities that exist in policing.” The man who drafted the 1994 crime bill that led to the arrest of countless black drug users is now claiming racism is endemic among American police.<br />Last May then-Attorney General William Barr launched a federal civil-rights probe into the death of George Floyd in police custody, and that investigation continues. But Democrats are now expanding the charge of wrongdoing to the entire department, seeking proof that Mr. Chauvin’s actions represent the culture of policing today. No matter that the Minneapolis police chief since 2017, Medaria Arradondo, testified for the prosecution in the Chauvin trial and has pushed to reform certain police practices like choke holds.<br />The weight of suspicion on police under pattern-or-practice investigations often leads officers under scrutiny to pull back on protecting public safety. A June 2020 study by economists Tanaya Devi and Roland Fryer found that federal probes after “viral incidents” similar to the Floyd killing decreased police actions by almost 90% in Chicago and 54% in Riverside, Calif. The authors estimate that such pullbacks led to nearly 900 excess homicides and 34,000 felonies across five cities in the two years after each Justice investigation began.</td>

      <td>A National Rifle Association board member said Wednesday that appointing a receiver to take charge of the organization—a tactic the NRA worried New York authorities would pursue before it filed bankruptcy—would spell the end of the 150-year-old gun rights group.<br />“It would be disastrous,” board member retired Lt. Col. Willes Lee testified during the third week of trial over the organization’s January bankruptcy filing and allegations of spending abuses by management brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.<br />The NRA has said it filed bankruptcy to prevent New York from putting the group into receivership. Ms. James sued to dissolve the NRA in August and is now seeking to either have the chapter 11 case thrown out or to bring in an independent trustee to take charge of the NRA in bankruptcy.<br />Lt. Col. Lee’s testimony kicked-off the NRA’s defense of chief executive Wayne LaPierre and his decision to file the chapter 11 in January. Lt. Col. Lee and fellow board member Tom King on Wednesday praised Mr. LaPierre’s character and his leadership. The NRA has argued Mr. LaPierre is critical to the group’s survival.<br />The NRA is seeking to keep control of its chapter 11 case so it can propose a reorganization plan and defeat a bid by New York authorities and its former ad agency Ackerman McQueen Inc. to wrest control of the bankruptcy from NRA management via a trustee.</td>

      <td>He knows life tenure isn’t meant to create a judiciary of pundits.</td>
      <td>How’s this for a potted display of the different progressive and conservative judicial temperaments? On Tuesday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in an immigration case. Imelda Lopez-Soto, a Mexican citizen who came to the U.S. illegally in 2000 at age 19, was contesting a removal order.<br />The three-judge panel was unanimous that the immigration court had not erred, and Ms. Lopez-Soto had not been denied due process. But the Sixth Circuit’s ruling, written and joined by two Bill Clinton appointees, reads in places like a newspaper op-ed. That prompted a short but notable separate opinion from Judge Amul Thapar, elevated to the bench in 2017 by President Trump.<br />“In an era in which it is difficult to find any issue upon which a large percentage of Americans agree, few people would dispute that our nation’s immigration system is broken and is need of a structural overhaul,” wrote Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey. “Admittedly, a not-insignificant number of Americans believe that any change to our immigration statutes should result in shutting our borders to almost all individuals, or at least to all potential immigrants who are not blond-haired and blue-eyed.”<br />Objection, your honor. Judge Daughtrey cited a 2020 survey in which 75% of Americans said they supported a path to legal status for people like Ms. Lopez-Soto. We count ourselves among that majority. But what does public polling have to do with the facts of this case? Life tenure isn’t intended to create a judiciary of robed pundits, and the insinuation of racism is especially inappropriate in a federal court opinion.<br />After that throat-clearing, Judge Daughtrey ruled against Ms. Lopez-Soto, saying the court’s duty “is to interpret the laws as they now are written.” But it’s not hard to see why a conservative judge, who views that as his sole job, would decline to sign on. Hence the brief concurrence by Judge Thapar, a son of Indian immigrants whose father, according to a 2016 profile in the Louisville Courier-Journal, “owns a heating and air-conditioning supply business.”</td>

      <td>The latest House Democratic power grab is unconstitutional.</td>
      <td>A week after the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee introduced legislation to pack the Supreme Court by adding four new Justices, the House is set to vote on a bill to pack the U.S. Senate by adding two new Senators. Unlike court-packing, the bill granting statehood to Washington, D.C., has majority support among elected Democrats and the official backing of the White House. But the impetus behind both measures is the same—to tilt the constitutional playing field and consolidate liberal power.<br />Fashioning an independent seat of government in a federal system while affording representation to its residents is a dilemma dating to the founding. The Framers provided in the Constitution’s Article I that Congress could, “by cession of particular states,” control a small area in which the federal government would operate. In 1790 part of the territories of Virginia and Maryland, two of the 13 states that ratified the Constitution, were delineated for federal control.<br />Advocates of statehood brush aside the constitutional concerns and frame their cause as a simple question of democracy. It’s true that the roughly 700,000 residents of the District don’t have the ability to elect voting Members of Congress. Many hold influence over the federal government as employees and contractors or in other positions, and in the Founding era proximity to the seat of power was itself considered a form of representation.<br />Yet the natural remedy for the imperfect status quo, if representation is the real concern, would be for Congress to do something it has done before—return part of the District to the state that ceded it in the first place. That’s what happened in 1846 when Congress reinstated Virginia’s control over the D.C. suburbs of Arlington and Alexandria.<br />We might similarly expect that principled advocates of representation for the D.C. residents would champion the return of most of the remaining territory to Maryland. That would grow Maryland’s congressional delegation by one seat and give current District residents a vote in Senate elections.</td>

      <td>His plan draws down private capital to fund current consumption, not actual infrastructure.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration’s $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan promises a revival of the nation’s infrastructure. But an infrastructure program should increase productivity and future wealth. That is, it should focus on investment, not current consumption. Over the long term, such a program would use federal funding to support aggregate demand, giving businesspeople further confidence in private investment.<br />The American Jobs Plan doesn’t do this. Worse, if passed, it will actually make future attempts to invest in the nation’s infrastructure more difficult.<br />The Biden plan proposes to spend only $115 billion on roads and bridges—much less than the $400 billion it earmarks for long-term care for the elderly and disabled. Even counting as infrastructure the plan’s $180 billion for research and development, the program spends far more on consumption than it does on investment.<br />This isn’t semantics. Productivity-enhancing infrastructure can be partly debt-financed and still be fiscally wise, as it adds to future wealth, private income and federal revenue. Particularly given the significant long-term U.S. fiscal imbalance, new spending on social programs—a k a consumption—should be funded by current tax revenue, not borrowing. Projected revenue from raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, and substantial further tax increases on U.S. multinational companies, won’t pay for the long-run additional social spending (even accepting a longer “window” for revenue increases than for the proposed spending).<br />Going deeper, the corporate tax increase as a funding mechanism is itself at odds with the goals of boosting investment and wealth through infrastructure improvements. Past infrastructure programs generally received support from user fees, as economists going back to Adam Smith have argued. By contrast, the corporate income tax reduces business investment and corporate capital. Higher taxes reduce the profitability of new investment, so you get less of it. Lower capital stock reduces productivity and wages. Workers suffer.</td>

      <td>A perception that’s long haunted Democrats—that they’re antipolice and weak on law-and-order—hurt them in 2020 and is likely to inflict even more damage on their electoral prospects in 2022.<br />Take Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D., N.Y.), who’s charged with protecting his party’s House majority as Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman. That’s a difficult job for any party in possession of the White House; since World War II, the average loss in the House for a president’s party in his first midterm has been about 28 seats. If that happens next year, Republicans will have 241 seats to the Democrats’ 194 and Nancy Pelosi will be out as Speaker.<br />But Mr. Maloney made his task more difficult during a recent interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” The host, a former GOP congressman who spends most of his airtime attacking Republicans, lobbed a softball. How would the DCCC chair “counteract” Republican charges that Democrats favor “defunding the police, cancel culture, socialism” and “packing the court”?<br />Mr. Maloney offered a three-word response: “lies and demagoguery.” He then veered off into hammering the need to emphasize racial justice, before calling Republican accusations “cheap political points” aimed at “whipping up white resentment.” The New Yorker finished off by decrying “racist voting laws” and saying we can’t go “back to the Jim Crow era.”<br />Mr. Scarborough was taken aback by Mr. Maloney’s inartful reply and asked again, “What do you say” to Republican arguments, for example, that “Democrats wanted to defund the police?” The congressman repeated that Democrats are “fighting for racial justice” while GOP favors what he termed “racist voting laws.” He triumphantly declared that Republicans “got their butt kicked in November,” and followed up with a diatribe about “the ugliest racism and Jim Crow era laws.” Mr. Maloney then demanded: “What the hell is the Republican Party doing?”</td>

      <td>If it really wants to transcend its founder’s eugenics legacy, it should disavow abortion due to a prenatal diagnosis of disability.</td>
      <td>Planned Parenthood is finally beginning to distance itself from the eugenics legacy of founder Margaret Sanger. But the belated acknowledgment is misleading at best. In an April 17 op-ed, Alexis McGill Johnson, the organization’s president, suggests Sanger distanced herself from the eugenics movement later in her career.<br />In fact, Planned Parenthood’s board overlapped with that of the American Eugenics Society for decades, even after Sanger’s retirement as president in 1959. In the 1960s, her successor, Alan F. Guttmacher, was the society’s vice president while also Planned Parenthood’s president. In 1952 Sanger helped secure a leadership position in Planned Parenthood’s German affiliate for Hans Harmsen, who had served as an officer in Nazi Germany’s Hereditary Health Court, which ordered mandatory sterilizations in the name of “racial hygiene.”<br />Sanger’s ideas about racial betterment—the elimination of “human weeds,” as she called them—weren’t merely the regrettably common views of “a different time.” She went further than most. In her proposed “baby code” of 1934, Sanger recommended that licenses to marry should be separated from licenses to have children. Article 4, meant to apply nationwide, stated: “No woman shall have the legal right to bear a child, and no man shall have the right to become a father, without a permit for parenthood.” Article 8 would have provided that “feeble-minded persons, habitual congenital criminals, those afflicted with heritable disease, and others found biologically unfit by authorities qualified [to] judge should be sterilized or, in cases of doubt, should be so isolated as to prevent the perpetuation of their afflictions by breeding.”<br />These lines were written not at the beginning of Sanger’s career but nearly two decades after she opened her first birth-control clinic in Brooklyn, N.Y. Coercion lay at the core of her strategy to stop the propagation of “the unfit.”<br />A 1991  New York Times article related the experience of Barbara Faye Waxman, a former employee at a Los Angeles Planned Parenthood clinic. “There was a strong eugenics mentality that exhibited disdain, discomfort and ignorance toward disabled babies,” said Waxman, who used a wheelchair and respirator because of a neuromuscular impairment. Planned Parenthood considered disabled infants to be “bad babies,” she said.</td>

      <td>A man who thought himself to be Francis Drake’s co-captain was tried for mutiny. The two men dined together on the night before his beheading.</td>
      <td>Francis Drake was the first sea captain to circumnavigate the globe—it took him three years (1577-80). In the course of his voyage, he boarded Spanish ships, raided Spanish colonies in South America, and made off with gold, silver and other treasure that Spain would have otherwise claimed. To the Spaniards, who called him “El Draque” (The Dragon), he was a pirate and plunderer. To the English, as one might imagine, he was something quite different: a hero. His voyage had been commissioned by Queen Elizabeth, to her great profit. She made him a knight, and, as Sir Francis, he became a member of Parliament. Later he was vice-admiral of the fleet that, with help from the weather, defeated the great Spanish Armada, a victory that was to have the same national significance—history entering into myth—as Nelson’s defeat of Napoleonic France at Trafalgar and the RAF’s Battle of Britain in 1940.<br />“In Search of a Kingdom,” Laurence Bergreen’s vivid account of the famous voyage, presents Drake for the most part in a heroic mold: bold, generous and often surprisingly humane. Drake had a lust for gold but not for slaughter. Though in early life he had been a slaver, serving with his cousin Sir John Hawkins, he was a devout, God-fearing Protestant who turned against the practice of slavery and established an alliance with the Cimarrons, escaped African slaves in Central America who had intermarried with the indigenous population. Drake became their “particular favourite,” Mr. Bergreen writes, and made one Cimarron his “longtime personal servant.”<br />Drake’s chaplain, the Rev. Francis Fletcher, kept a journal of the voyage that he would publish as “The World Encompassed.” Mr. Bergreen, whose previous books include voyage-centered chronicles of Columbus and Marco Polo, naturally draws on this journal, for it is the only authentic firsthand record we possess. It is thanks to Fletcher that we have a detailed account of the animosity and suspicion that developed between Drake and Thomas Doughty, who, probably mistakenly, believed himself to be a co-captain. Doughty opposed Drake’s plan to round South America and advocated a return home with the substantial booty already acquired. Drake accused him of mutiny and staged a trial before a jury he had picked, and Doughty was sentenced to death. Fletcher writes that Drake and Doughty then dined together “as cheerfully in sobriety as ever in their lives.” The next day Doughty was beheaded.<br />There may have been more than personal rivalry in the quarrel. Drake’s commission from Queen Elizabeth had been made secretly, lest the enterprise alienate Spain. But this secrecy—and the latitude it seemed to give to Drake—went too far for her cautious chief minister, William Cecil, and Doughty seems to have been his man, charged to keep Drake’s war on Spanish shipping within bounds. Such caution was not without reason. Spain was the great power in Europe as well as in South America. What led eventually to open war between England and Spain—and the launch and defeat of the Armada—was not only the support that England gave to the Dutch Revolt in the 1570s and 1580s but also, to a degree, Drake’s depredations on his voyage.<br />Mr. Bergreen is determined to argue that “Drake became the catalyst in England’s great transition from an island nation to the British Empire,” and he sees Elizabeth’s reign as the time from which that empire supplanted Spain’s. There is some truth in this, but it is still an exaggeration. Spain remained the great power in Europe for another half-century and was then supplanted by France, not England. What is more, Spain’s American empire survived until the 19th century. Conversely England, or rather the United Kingdom after the 1707 Treaty of Union with Scotland, didn’t become a great imperial power until the 18th century, even if English colonies had already been planted in North America and some West Indian islands annexed. In any case, Britain was never a dominant power in Europe in the way that Spain, France and Germany, in succession, proved to be.</td>

      <td>Such arrangements have worked in other countries whose economic and political woes seemed intractable.</td>
      <td>Lebanon is entangled in a web of economic and political crises. At its center is a currency crisis. It erupted in October 2019, when the “financial engineering” scheme employed by the Banque du Liban, the Lebanese central bank, finally collapsed. The Lebanese pound’s 22-year link of 1,507.5 to the U.S. dollar was broken at that time. Banking and political crises immediately ensued. By July 2020, Lebanon had defaulted on its sovereign debt and was engulfed in hyperinflation.<br />Today, Lebanon remains in a paralytic political standoff. The Lebanese pound has shed 86% of its value against the greenback since the crisis began. Inflation rages at an annual rate of 295%. The banking crisis deepens, with tight restrictions on depositor withdrawals. As a result, the economy collapses and poverty soars.<br />The Banque du Liban is at the center of the storm. It administers a bizarre concoction of multiple exchange rates and fuels a massive subsidy program. A year’s worth of these subsidies are four times as large as Lebanon’s entire 2021 budget. For most of the subsidized items—like fuel, medical supplies and wheat—importers who qualify are allowed to purchase dollars from the Banque du Liban at an 88% discount to the black-market rate. This allows the participants to sell those imports at roughly eight times what they had to pay for them.<br />Many subsidized products never find their way into Lebanese markets. They are often re-exported or smuggled into neighboring countries and sold for dollars. Others are warehoused in Lebanon, waiting for higher prices. Consequently, shortages of subsidized goods abound, select importers make a killing, and the Banque du Liban’s foreign reserves are drained and transferred to a privileged few.<br />If nothing changes, this doomsday machine will devour the country’s foreign exchange. Lebanon will become a bankrupt failed state—something like Venezuela.</td>

      <td>A portion of President Biden’s $2 trillion American Jobs Plan would fund roads, bridges and railways, but one essential piece of infrastructure is overlooked entirely: the U.S. shipbuilding base.<br />For years there has been a bipartisan consensus that the U.S. Navy should grow to 355 ships from 296. But a larger, more capable Navy needs shipyards to build and maintain the fleet. During World War II, the U.S. had 10 large Navy yards with drydocks and repair facilities, as well as more than 40 commercial drydocks. Today there are only four industrial Navy yards, in Hawaii, Maine, Virginia and Washington state. By my count, fewer than 20 commercial sites are certified for naval use.<br />There simply isn’t enough capacity to expand and service the fleet, which is why the Navy hasn’t grown much even as its budget has expanded. The production of Virginia-class fast-attack submarines and Burke-class destroyers has fallen six to 12 months behind schedule even as lawmakers say they want to buy more of these ships.<br />Maintenance has fallen even further behind. The USS Boise, a fast-attack submarine, was scheduled to start maintenance in 2015 at the Navy shipyard in Norfolk, Va. But Norfolk was backed up with other maintenance, and eventually the sub was moved to a commercial yard in nearby Newport News. The delay ate up more than three years, or about 10% of the ship’s service life, the Congressional Budget Office reports.<br />Things are likely to get worse. Only one of the Navy’s drydocks, No. 8 in Norfolk, is big enough to hold the new Ford-class aircraft carrier, which is scheduled to replace Nimitz-class carriers over the next few decades. Even worse, more than 50 ships need to be retired in the next few years, largely because the Navy has been unable to maintain them sufficiently over the past two decades.</td>

Cory Booker (D., N.J.) and Tim Scott (R., S.C.).<br />In March, the Democratic-controlled House again passed its bill, the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act, but it doesn’t have enough support in the Senate to advance. The legislation, among other steps, would reduce funding for state and local police departments that don’t ban chokeholds and create a public database of shared disciplinary records.<br />A rival GOP proposal from last year would collect more data around police practices, establish new training programs and widen the use of body cameras, among other proposals.</td>

      <td>Hertz Global Holdings Inc.  agreed to provide some value to equity holders when it leaves chapter 11, vindicating the individual traders who have insisted the company is worth something despite its bankruptcy filing.<br />Hertz proposed in a chapter 11 exit plan on Wednesday that current stockholders receive warrants to purchase up to 4% of the restructured business, the first time the company has said it is worth enough to distribute some value to its owners.<br />The shareholder distribution would amount to a recovery of 60 to 70 cents per share, a “material return to equity,” Hertz lawyer Thomas Lauria said during a court hearing Wednesday.<br />If approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., that outcome would make Hertz a relative rarity in corporate bankruptcies, in which equity ranks behind debt and most often is wiped out. Hertz shares closed at $1.74 on Wednesday, down 8.4% on the day but up 36% year to date.<br />The proposed distribution to equity is part of a restructuring proposal put forth by Dundon Capital Partners LLC, Centerbridge Partners LP and Warburg Pincus LLC, selected by Hertz earlier this month after a competitive process to finance the company’s exit from chapter 11.</td>

      <td>MINNEAPOLIS—Downtown remained largely boarded up the day after a jury found former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of murdering George Floyd, whose killing sparked a summer of unrest here and across the country.<br />Store windows along the retail district in downtown Minneapolis remain so thoroughly covered with plywood that finding the entrance to the few stores that remain open is challenging. The streets Wednesday were generally empty and fencing surrounded some government buildings. There were still national guardsmen in camouflage clustered in groups of four or five trying to keep warm in the 40 degree temperatures.<br />The National Guard had been called in and businesses and schools had been prepared for a new wave of unrest after the verdict. That didn’t happen. Instead, people spent Tuesday night celebrating. Some grilled hot dogs and others sold T-shirts. At a memorial to Mr. Floyd at the corner where he was killed, people danced as music blared long into the night.<br />Some businesses say they plan to keep safety precautions in place for several months. The funeral for Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man shot by a police officer earlier this month just outside Minneapolis, is Thursday. The anniversary of Mr. Floyd’s murder is next month, and the trial of the three remaining former officers who are charged with aiding and abetting Mr. Chauvin in second-degree murder is scheduled for later this summer.<br />“It’s credible for a building owner to say this is all so unpredictable, so we are just going to wait and see what happens,” said Jonathan Weinhagen, the president and chief executive of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber of Commerce. Riots last year sparked by Mr. Floyd’s murder caused damage exceeding $1 billion.</td>

      <td>Investors turn to banks, energy producers and other stocks as Covid-19 vaccines reach more people and economy picks up</td>
      <td>Biotech shares have slumped in recent months, stung by setbacks in clinical trials and a rotation away from growth stocks after a steep rally in 2020.<br />The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has fallen 10% from its Feb. 8 record, lagging behind the S&P 500, which has gained 6.6%, and the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite, which has slipped 0.3%, over that period. The decline has left the biotech index up 2.2% for the year, compared with respective gains of 11% and 8.2% for the other two indexes.<br />The disparity illustrates the heightened riskiness of biotech investing, where clinical trials and regulatory decisions can make or break a company’s value. Investors in biotech stocks are enticed by the potential for handsome gains that can follow scientific breakthroughs. But that prospect is often accompanied by stock-price volatility, since new treatments have no promise of success. Shifts in the economic outlook can also affect perceptions of the group.<br />Shares of  Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.,   Amicus Therapeutics Inc.  and  Frequency Therapeutics Inc.  are among the recent losers for biotech investors, having lost more than half their value so far this year.<br />“It’s felt like a kitchen sink in terms of the number of factors weighing on biotech sentiment in the near term,” said Andy Acker, who manages the Janus Henderson Global Life Sciences Fund. Among those are disappointing clinical trials, concern about the possibility of renewed focus on drug prices in Washington and the recent rotation into economically sensitive stocks.</td>

      <td>A Peacock comedy starring Ed Helms wades into the debate over removing historic statues, but the jokes sink fast.</td>
      <td>Created by Sierra Teller Ornelas, Michael Schur and its star, Ed Helms, the comedy series “Rutherford Falls” tackles two great American pastimes—giving offense and taking offense—without wanting to offend at all. Which does seem a waste. There’s a caustically funny show buried somewhere beneath “Rutherford Falls.” It might have to be made in Canada.<br />“It’s not a great time for people who love statues,” says the mayor of Rutherford Falls, Deidre Chisenhall (Dana L. Wilson), which is about as provocative as matters get. The statue alluded to is in the middle—literally—of the main thoroughfare of Ms. Chisenhall’s upstate New York town. Distracted motorists keep driving into it, because the otherwise unremarkable bronze monument occupies the center of a too-narrow street.<br />How did it get there? Was the road built around it? Was the town built around the statue? Viewers will wonder, and keep wondering. The point is that Lawrence Rutherford—the subject of the memorial—was not a slave-owning general. He didn’t massacre the indigenous Minishonka, whose descendants have grown up side-by-side with the white Rutherfordians and now take their money at the Running Thunder casino. He made his fortune selling toothbrushes to fur traders. Moving his likeness would seem to be a simple act of civic improvement, not politics. But to Nathan Rutherford (Mr. Helms), the most ardent and perhaps only defender of his family’s legacy, the proposal to move “Big Larry” is an affront, an outrage, a scandal. A slap in the face to everything American. “Respect history, that’s all I’m trying to say,” Nathan insists.<br />Insist away, Nathan. Everybody will get it. “Rutherford Falls” is not subtle, sly or especially amusing, especially given its trivializing take on current events. For all the watered-down particulars, the series is really about Civil War statuary, Christopher Columbus, reparations, political correctness, “cancel culture” and corporate blackmail: Rutherford Inc., a vast multinational that makes “everything from missile guidance systems to wet wipes,” was founded by Nathan’s forebears and still uses Big Larry as its logo. Whenever Nathan—a nonvoting member of the board of directors and a huge pain to the company’s PR department—puts his foot in his mouth, the corporation gags. And when the Minishonka decide to get litigious, Nathan is the ostensible target. But Rutherford Inc. is what they really have in mind.<br />Mr. Helms, who can do the obliviously nerdy like no one else, is playing a character rather finely wrought by the largely indigenous writers of “Rutherford Falls,” a staff apparently politically correct enough to do the politically incorrect. There are as many strivers, climbers, schemers and snobs among the Minishonka as there are clueless narcissists among their neighbors. Casino operator Terry Thomas (Michael Greyeyes) isn’t above using white guilt to his own ends, while kidding himself into thinking his intentions are motivated solely by historical grievance, rather than his own ego.</td>

The new examination will seek to determine whether Minneapolis officers routinely violate citizens’ rights through excessive force, discriminatory policing or other behavior.<br />The Justice Department already has begun reaching out to community groups and the public to learn about their experiences with Minneapolis officers, Mr. Garland said.<br />A state jury on Tuesday convicted Mr. Chauvin of murder and manslaughter in Mr. Floyd’s killing in May, which set off nationwide protests over policing in the U.S. and bipartisan calls for change.<br />“Yesterday’s verdict in the state criminal trial does not address potentially systemic policing issues in Minneapolis,” Mr. Garland said. “Building trust between community and law enforcement will take time and effort by all of us.

There won’t be bleachers where fans can gather and cheer this year. And the ranks of photographers and media for “Who are you wearing?” interviews will be considerably cut back.<br />To many stylists, the Oscars ceremony is a symbolic turning of a corner in the pandemic. “It’s a glimpse of returning to normalcy to people,” said New York-based stylist Chloe Hartstein, who will be in Los Angeles to dress best supporting actress nominee Glenn Close for the event. “It’s a little glimpse of our old lives.”</td>

      <td>At least one Michigan resident has had it with the state’s seemingly endless series of aggressive and ineffective restrictions and recommendations against individual liberty. And she just might inspire a nationwide revolt against Covid rules that continue to burden citizens in many states—even after the administration of more than 213 million vaccine doses nationwide.<br />David Eggert reports for the Associated Press on the plucky Michigander who was not about to let misguided state policy deny her a chance to visit a cherished family member. Gretchen Whitmer, a resident of Lansing, appears to have hit her personal lockdown limit sometime within the last several months. And haven’t we all? But what’s especially encouraging about her rejection of Michigan Covid policy is that she is its principal author. According to the AP report:<br />Now that Ms. Whitmer and her colleagues have joined the campaign against Whitmer policy, their example could be extremely powerful. The Democratic governor’s rejection of her own advice was eminently sensible. Her father, fortunate to live in the Sunshine State, where policy prioritizes the protection of senior citizens, had already been vaccinated at the time of her visit. Let’s hope their special time together wasn’t spoiled by some cranky family member insisting on masks even for the vaccinated.<br />Let’s also hope that Michigan residents outside the public sector will also be free to be with the people they love. The AP has more:<br />After fully embracing the Covid policy panic for most of the last year, perhaps the governor was able to gain a new perspective as she quietly travelled out of state. Perhaps the trip’s disclosure will hasten the day when Ms. Whitmer will  answer the question recently posed by Ingrid Jacques in the Detroit Free Press: When is the governor going to ”set Michigan free”?

Talks in Vienna are complicated by domestic politics in Washington and Tehran and by Iran’s refusal to meet directly with the U.S.<br />President Biden wants to return to the 2015 deal after former President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018. The U.S. decision to quit the deal and impose sweeping sanctions on Iran prompted Tehran to breach many of the key restrictions in the accord, making a return to the agreement’s provisions and limits difficult for both sides.<br />Senior officials in Vienna this week wrapped up five days of talks, with delegations returning home before negotiations resume next week. People involved in the talks say progress has come as the U.S. laid out more clearly the contours of the sanctions relief it is prepared to provide.<br />Many of the sanctions were imposed under Mr. Trump using U.S. terrorism authorities, and U.S. officials previously have said they are willing to consider lifting some of them.

It would be the latest in a series of efforts to unwind Trump administration policies that eased environmental rules.<br />California, the nation’s biggest car market, has long set emissions standards that exceed requirements set by the federal government, an exception that was allowed under a waiver to the Clean Air Act. As a result, California’s standards became the de facto national standard.<br />That became a source of conflict during the Trump years as auto makers asked the Trump administration for relief from a deal the Obama administration negotiated with California and the industry to increase fuel-economy standards.<br />The Trump administration moved to relax the Obama standards, saying easing the regulations would lower consumer costs and boost auto sales. To do it, the administration’s Transportation Department adopted a new policy that said California didn’t have the legal authority to set its own fuel-economy standards. The move kicked off a long legal battle that auto makers worried would complicate their planning for future models.</td>

Today, they have hit a sweet spot. Consumers are eager to buy cars but  manufacturing bottlenecks in things like semiconductors are limiting supply, lifting pricing for both new and used vehicles.<br />Both  AutoNation  and  Lithia Motors ,  which sell new and used vehicles, blew past Wall Street expectations on their top and bottom lines. First-quarter sales jumped 27% and 55% for the two auto dealers, respectively, compared with a year earlier. The two also beat expectations on net income. The numbers represent significant bumps even compared with pre-pandemic 2019.<br />Auto retailers have seen brisk business as they capitalize on tight supply for new cars. The average new-car price in March was 9.3% higher than a year ago, while used cars have gotten 14% more expensive, according to data from Edmunds. That is being reflected in the companies’ bottom lines: AutoNation’s gross profit per vehicle was 61.2% higher in the first quarter compared with a year earlier for new vehicles and 17.3% higher for used cars. The same metrics were up 33.6% and 9.3%, respectively, for Lithia Motors.<br />There is no time for dealers to rest on their laurels, however.

      <td>A hard year for Hollywood translates to a savory moment for people who indulge in Oscars schadenfreude. To those skeptics, the prestige and relevance of the Academy Awards has been in decline for a long time. Maybe 2020 came to finish the job.<br />Theaters were the wrong kind of dark. Would-be blockbusters, including some likely awards contenders, were wiped from the calendar. And awards telecasts got cut off at the knees by Zoom-dependent productions and the indifference of pandemic-fatigued audiences, with the most recent Emmys, Golden Globes and Grammys playing to their smallest TV viewerships ever.<br />The question, this trend suggests, isn’t if April 25 will bring a new bottom to Oscars viewership, but just how low it will be for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and ABC, which has a deal to broadcast the ceremony through 2028.<br />And yet, the Oscars presents a big opportunity to script the ending of this memorable chapter for the movies. Loosening Covid restrictions allow for a live, in-person affair from Los Angeles, along with hubs in London, Paris and other cities where nominees will join via satellite feed. Plus, the industry’s punch-drunk status gives producers license to reboot some aspects of the ceremony.<br />“We are just trying to create an experience that has the aesthetics of a film, as opposed to a TV show,” says Steven Soderbergh, the innovative filmmaker (and “Contagion” director) who is producing the telecast with Jesse Collins and Stacey Sher.</td>

Shortly after permission was granted, the submarine lost contact and couldn’t be reached again, the navy said.<br />The submarine may have lost control and descended to 600 or 700 meters, the navy said. Oil spills around the area suggested the possibility of fuel tank damage due to water pressure, it said.<br />Indonesian naval vessels with sonar capability looked for the submarine but were unsuccessful. The navies of Singapore and Australia answered a call for assistance with the search.<br />A rescue ship, MV SWIFT, was dispatched from Singapore, said Hadi Tjahjanto, Indonesia’s military chief. The ship is equipped with a submersible rescue vessel that can slip underwater, connect with a submarine and ferry crew to safety, according to information on Singapore’s defense ministry website.</td>

Credit institutions, including the large U.S. banks that have subsidiaries in the EU, would also have to comply. The bloc also unveiled its classification system that will define green investments, and said the taxonomy will apply from next year.<br />If passed, companies in the EU will have to start disclosing sustainability metrics, similarly to financial reporting. The taxonomy is expected to be used as a tool to cut down on “greenwashing,” a term that describes an exaggeration of sustainability claims. The initial version of the taxonomy labels bioenergy as green, but doesn’t include nuclear energy and natural gas, although this may be revised.<br />Sustainability has emerged as a hot topic in finance. It is commonly known by the acronym ESG, which stands for environmental, social and governance—three pillars on which companies are judged.</td>

      <td>Want great skin but lack the faintest idea of where to start? Here, three utterly simple steps to getting a healthy, hydrated visage, care of dermatologists—plus, the only three products you need.</td>
      <td>ASIDE FROM dutifully washing my face twice a day, I don’t have a true dedicated skin-care routine. A lot of men don’t. I spoke with several board-certified dermatologists across the country, and they noted that many of their patients do no more than scrub their faces with a slab of soap.<br />If you’re a dermatologic do-nothing just looking for a simple routine, you might find the knotty, modern skin-care market forbidding. Visit your local pharmacy and you’ll encounter shelves of serums, creams and other concoctions packed with “uh, what does that do?” ingredients like ascorbic acid and avocado extract. As I learned, however, you mercifully don’t need a painstaking, 12-product routine to cut down on splotches or look less oily. “It’s always surprising to people how little they actually have to commit to [in order] to see results,” said Dr. Corey L. Hartman, a dermatologist in Birmingham, Ala.<br />Most doctors I interviewed pointed to just three steps as the foundation of a successful skin-care regimen and suggested sticking with products you can find at any drugstore. You can safely ignore offerings that claim to be specifically “for men”: They may come in steely gray containers and smell musky, but they’ll yield the same end results as more blandly packaged, un-gendered options. As New York dermatologist Dr. Anthony Rossi said, your toothpaste isn’t gendered. Your moisturizer doesn’t need to be either. Here, the only three moves you need to maintain your skin.<br />Step away from the Dial. Dr. Thomas Rohrer of Chestnut Hill, Mass., explained that a “harsh” bar of soap will strip off “too much oil” which breaks down your skin’s natural barrier, leaving your visage vulnerable to irritation. (Dr. Rohrer also recommended that you wash with lukewarm, not scalding, water. Remember, you’re trying to gently rinse off a few oily smudges from a single day, not erase a century of soot.) Dermatologists endorsed using a mellower twice-daily cleanser instead of standard soap. If you have particularly oily skin—read: if your forehead glistens like a glazed doughnut—Dr. Rossi of New York recommended a face-wash with glycolic acid or salicylic acid, which will absorb into your oil glands, cutting down that shiny look. If you have dry skin or are susceptible to rashes such as eczema, try a mild cleanser that doesn’t contain blotch-inducing acids and has “non-comedogenic” ingredients that won’t clog your pores. These tender cleansers are marketed specifically toward us dermis dummies, with names that often contain the word “gentle,” as in Cetaphil’s “Gentle Skin Cleanser,” pictured here. Cetaphil Face Wash, $14, ulta.com<br />Even if you don’t have naturally dry skin, you should moisturize at least once—if not twice—a day. “Especially in the cold winter months, your skin gets very dry and irritated. To maintain that skin barrier, we need to use a moisturizer,” said Dr. Robert Anolik of New York. If your skin is exceptionally parched and crackly, reach for moisturizers with “humectant” ingredients like glycerin, which attracts and traps water on the skin’s surface, said Dr. Hartman of Birmingham. If, on the other hand, you have sheeny skin, employ a moisturizer that bills itself as “oil free,” like the Jack Black formula pictured here. This sounds obvious, but some of the most popular moisturizing products on the market like Vaseline and Aquaphor are sneakily oil-based and can cause bothersome breakouts if you’re acne-prone. Dermatologists also note that it’s particularly important to moisturize after shaving, when your skin is at its most exposed. As for the theory that you need a different moisturizer for morning and night, most dermatologists don’t split those hairs. The best moisturizer, they contend, is the one you’ll actually use.

But the organization that runs Hollywood’s most prestigious awards ceremony is on solid financial ground, with a growing collection of assets approaching $1 billion, according to the academy and its affiliates’ consolidated financial statements.<br />Most people know the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) for staging the Oscars. Thanks to some savvy investing and consistent annual revenue, the academy is also a wealthy nonprofit with influence extending far beyond one red-carpet event.<br />Sagging ratings haven’t hurt the revenues Ampas generates through its lucrative U.S. and international TV deals. The Oscars airs in more than 200 countries.<br />As the 93rd edition of the show takes place Sunday at 8 p.m. ET, here’s a look at some key numbers behind this organization:<br />Ampas’s annual awards revenues reached $131.9 million in 2020, capping a decade of robust growth anchored by its huge TV deals. The academy’s assets grew by more than $30 million last year. It posted $82.7 million in revenues in 2010.</td>

After I helped introduce him in 1995, Mundell became a rock star there for his advocacy of a fixed exchange rate. His policy prevailed for a decade, which saw China’s greatest economic growth. It ended the Asian financial crisis in 1997 when China refused to devalue. Mundell’s death was widely publicized in China.<br />By the 2008 financial crisis, China had abandoned the flip side of Mundell’s exchange-rate prescription, namely fiscal-policy adjustment, including privatization and an end to subsidization of industrial inputs. When Mundell had a stroke early in the Xi era, disabling his speech, China became the worse for it. Meanwhile, Mundell’s base moved from Beijing to Hong Kong, where he was befriended by its champion of free men and free markets, Jimmy Lai, who funded several of Mundell’s summer conferences.<br />Never let it be thought that Mundell flattered the Chinese leadership. During my decade in China I witnessed him speak truth to power publicly, which the leadership allowed him to do but never published. At a China State Information Center press conference in 2010, he was asked to rate Chinese credit-rating agencies. He said they would never merit more than a “C+” because financial markets require the free flow of information, which was prohibited in China.<br />Robert Blohm<br />Fort Erie, Ontario</td>

      <td>His intrinsic-value approach to investing was, in essence, a conservative way to build net worth.</td>
      <td>Regarding Philip Delves Broughton’s review of Justyn Walsh’s “Investing With Keynes” (“Cambridge Values,” Bookshelf, March 30): It is refreshing to find out that John Maynard Keynes, the patron saint of politicians eager to spend other people’s money to arrest an economic downturn, was a value fundamentalist when it came to his personal investment philosophy. His intrinsic-value approach to investing was, in essence, a conservative way to build net worth in impressive fashion.<br />Keynes’s ideas about fortunate seeds that produce inequality are germane today as the U.S. moves toward permanent Keynesian spending, regardless of economic conditions, to fix an alleged inequitable distribution of wealth. Democrats dismiss the “fortunate in abilities” side of Keynes’s wealth-building formula and focus exclusively on the “fortunate in situation” side. Much of the inequality is attributed to white privilege, and it is believed that only government can level that playing field. The income and wealth transfers desired by Democrats can’t be achieved without trashing merit and persuading people that financial success is unearned and unfair.<br />Keynes had net assets of about $30 million in today’s money when he died. His disciples running Washington today stoke resentment of people with that kind of money. Keynes was a white man of privilege making money in an unfair system in which merit was an illusion. Why, then, do his ideas merit such reverence here and now? Apparently any intellectual port is welcome in a progressive storm of government spending.<br />R. Riley Williams<br />Sarasota, Fla.</td>

      <td>ASML, which sells semiconductor-manufacturing equipment to the likes of Intel, expects to grow revenue by almost 30% this year and is ramping up capacity</td>
      <td>Good news for anyone looking for a new car: The microchip industry is mustering faster than expected to solve today’s crippling shortages.<br />ASML ,  which competes with  Applied Materials  to sell semiconductor-manufacturing gear to the likes of  Intel  and  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ,  on Wednesday more than doubled its growth forecast for the year and said it was increasing production capacity for 2022—a reassuring sign for any business that needs chips to make its products and any consumer waiting for them. The stock jumped 4%.<br />The Dutch manufacturer has grown to become Europe’s most valuable technology company, with a market value of $257 billion. That compares to just $118 billion for Applied Materials, even though the U.S. company has slightly higher revenue. One reason is ASML’s near-monopolistic position in a cutting-edge chip-making technology called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Intel’s new chief executive, Pat Gelsinger, last month said the company erred in not embracing EUV earlier.<br />ASML’s EUV revenue will grow 30% this year—that hasn’t changed—but it is working with its supply chain to ramp up output for next year ahead of its previous plans. The company also said it was looking at boosting capacity in more standard deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography. Given that the current shortage seems to be affecting basic chips as much as advanced ones, concrete steps here would be welcome.<br />That said, ASML’s DUV business will manage nicely this year with just existing capacity. Following big capital-spending announcements by TSMC, Intel and Samsung, the company expects to increase revenues by 30% in 2021, led by DUV machines. Its previous guidance implied growth of around 12%. Meanwhile, ASML’s first-quarter results were boosted by a more immediate response to the shortage as chipmakers bought software upgrades that increase the output of existing machines.</td>

      <td>An officer’s cruelty, a mob’s threats and a long, tragic history add up to a conviction for murder.</td>
      <td>George Floyd at his death was 46, two years older than F. Scott Fitzgerald when he died in Hollywood. Fitzgerald was born across the river from Minneapolis, in St. Paul. Both men had bad habits—addictions. Floyd was poor and black. Fitzgerald was white, privileged and occasionally rich; or anyway he consorted with rich people and dreamed about them. Both men were known to smash things up (as Fitzgerald wrote of Tom and Daisy Buchanan) and then to retreat into their “vast carelessness.” In the 1920s, Fitzgerald would get drunk at Gerald and Sarah Murphy’s Villa America on the Riviera and break their expensive crystal. Floyd served four years in prison for a 2007 robbery and home invasion.<br />It’s obviously absurd to compare Floyd to Fitzgerald. And yet why not compare them? Each has a place in America’s folklore—two sides of the nation’s coin. In each, you behold a complicated American life and a common denominator of tragedy and waste and relatively early death. And which of those two imperfect lives will prove to be more consequential? Which is more representative—or says more about their imperfect country?<br />Derek Chauvin’s trial became a melodrama of American themes: racial grievance, rage, rebellion, justice and injustice, revenge. It became historic American theater, up there with Sacco and Vanzetti, the Scottsboro Boys, Alger Hiss and O.J. Simpson—that last one a circus and a travesty and a showcase of the idea of jury nullification, the principle that appeals to what the pioneering black lawyer Dovey Roundtree called “justice older than the law.”<br />During the Chauvin trial, a rumbling of the idea of jury nullification—a huge, credible threat of mayhem if the jury didn’t deliver what President Biden called the “right verdict”—passed through the streets of nearly every city in the country. Mob nullification proclaims that it doesn’t matter what the law says, not when you come down to the fiercer basics. The Ku Klux Klan also embraced the tactic; it isn’t a principle that a country can afford to indulge very often. But Minneapolis stirred a memory of Nat Turner’s slave rebellion, too.<br />Smartphone videos were decisive in the Minneapolis morality play. Floyd had already established that he was claustrophobic. He was placed in a prone position on the pavement, pinned by knees on his neck and back, which intensified the symptom a claustrophobe most fears: I can’t breathe! That was the crux of it: the sadism—the gratuitous and, one might say, thoughtful cruelty. Maximize the suffering; test the helpless man’s limits. I once wrote a book about evil, and found that one of evil’s signature qualities is its weirdly intelligent and speculative gratuitousness, as if it were saying, “I wonder what will happen if I . . .”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Justice Department has formed a task force to curtail the proliferation of ransomware cyberattacks, in a bid to make the popular extortion schemes less lucrative by targeting the entire digital ecosystem that supports them.<br />In an internal memorandum issued this week, Acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin said ransomware poses not just an economic threat to businesses but “jeopardizes the safety and health of Americans.”<br />By identifying ransomware as a priority, the task force will increase training and dedicate more resources to the issue, seek to improve intelligence sharing across the department, and work to identify “links between criminal actors and nation-states,” according to the memorandum.<br />“By any measure, 2020 was the worst year ever when it comes to ransomware and related extortion events,” Mr. Carlin, who previously ran the Justice Department’s national-security division during the Obama administration, told The Wall Street Journal. “And if we don’t break the back of this cycle, a problem that’s already bad is going to get worse.”<br />Ransomware attacks, in which hackers cripple a software system until they receive a bounty, surged last year during the pandemic, along with financial demands, according to security experts and U.S. officials. The attacks have been around for decades but have flourished as society has become more dependent on technology.</td>

      <td>SEOUL—The Japanese government can’t be forced to provide fiscal compensation to South Korean women coerced into sexual slavery for Tokyo’s military during World War II, a Seoul court said, adding fresh legal uncertainties to a long-running dispute that diplomacy has failed to resolve.<br />Wednesday’s ruling by the Seoul central district court broke with a verdict for a similar case, heard in the same court, just months ago. In January, a different set of judges ordered the Japanese government to pay about $90,000 in reparations to a dozen Korean women.<br />The two verdicts disagreed on whether the Japanese government should enjoy state immunity, an international-law provision that protects sovereign countries from being tried in foreign courts. The January verdict concluded the atrocities against the South Korean victims were so severe that they superseded state-immunity exception.<br />On Wednesday, judges cited a 2012 ruling by the International Court of Justice, which tossed out a World War II-era case regarding Italian victims seeking reparations from Germany, using state immunity as the rationale. Nearly two dozen former sex slaves had sought roughly $2.7 million in compensation from Japan.<br />“This court does not disagree that the victims have the right to claim compensation,” the judges said in their ruling. “But as of now, suing a foreign country cannot be allowed.”</td>

      <td>Administration is looking to assert U.S. leadership on climate policy amid tensions with China</td>
      <td>President Biden is expected this week to call for cutting U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions roughly in half by 2030, according to people familiar with the matter, as he pushes to jump-start global efforts to tackle climate change.<br />Mr. Biden will release the new goal during a virtual summit at the White House on Thursday and Friday, part of an effort to assert global leadership on climate issues amid tensions with China. The new target seeks to reduce over the next nine years emissions by 50% from levels in 2005. Emissions last year were already projected to be down 21% from that 2005 baseline, due in part to a slowdown related to the pandemic. But this year, emissions are tracking higher again as the economy recovers.<br />Administration officials said 40 world leaders would participate in the event. Mr. Biden invited a group that comprises European allies and some autocrats from U.S. rivals that are among the world’s biggest emitters and fossil-fuel producers, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The White House has noted that invitees include 17 countries responsible for about 80% of all global emissions, an effort to supercharge ambitions going into negotiations scheduled for November to raise targets for reducing emissions.<br />There will be no bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the virtual event, administration officials said. The summit will feature discussions about climate finance, resilience and adaptation. Several high-level Biden administration officials will participate, including the secretaries of state and defense.<br />Some developing countries are expected to use the summit to urge wealthier nations to help finance efforts to reduce emissions and to adapt to the effects of a warming planet. Brazil has asked the Biden administration for $1 billion in exchange for it reducing deforestation by 40%. India, meantime, has also stressed to the U.S. the importance of industrialized countries making good on pledges to mobilize as much as $100 billion a year in support of similar efforts.</td>

      <td>An official finding that he died of natural causes doesn’t support earlier accounts that he died of injuries incurred during the Jan. 6 Capitol attack</td>
      <td>Washington’s medical examiner found this week that Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick died a natural death on Jan. 7, a day after he clashed with protesters at the Capitol. That official determination, coming months after the event, was at odds with earlier assertions by Capitol Police that Mr. Sicknick succumbed to injuries incurred during the Capitol riot. Here is how the account of Mr. Sicknick’s death unfolded.<br />Mr. Sicknick was part of a police line near a bike-rack barrier set up around 2:20 p.m. on the U.S. Capitol’s lower west terrace, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. At that time, rioters were descending on the Capitol to protest Congress certifying Joe Biden as the winner of the November presidential election.<br />As rioters started to pull on the bike rack, one of them allegedly sprayed three officers, including Mr. Sicknick, with a chemical spray, according to the FBI affidavit for the alleged assailant’s arrest. The officers were “temporarily blinded,” according to the affidavit, and were “unable to perform their duties for at least 20 minutes or longer while they recovered from the spray.” Mr. Sicknick also reported to his supervisors and colleagues that he had been sprayed in the face with a substance, the affidavit said.<br />Around 10 p.m. that night, Mr. Sicknick collapsed at the Capitol and was transported by D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services to a local hospital. Mr. Sicknick, 42 years old, died at 9:30 p.m. the following night.<br />The Wall Street Journal and others reported initially that Mr. Sicknick was “struck in the head with a fire extinguisher” during the unrest, citing a law-enforcement official. That official said Capitol Police officers had initially shared that description with colleagues.</td>

      <td>The island has faced a series of challenges lately but its essential charms—and blissful beaches—remain largely the same, reports one former resident</td>
      <td>ON A RECENT visit to a beachfront cultural center in Loíza, a Puerto Rican town with the island’s largest Black community, I heard Afro-Puerto Rican folkloric music blasting from a car stereo. A young man danced, another carved a ceremonial mask from a coconut and one more filled my glass with his homemade sugar-cane liquor flavored with guava fruit.<br />A cultural reawakening is under way in Loíza, a former slave enclave outside San Juan. One manifestation: the Bomba, a drum, song and dance tradition rooted in West Africa that has become an expression of Puerto Rican identity. “You must come back on Sunday,” said Wilfredo “Apex” Aponte, a community leader. “You’ll see dancing, singing, drumming, lots of people. We want visitors to see this.”<br />I moved to San Juan in 1990 and stayed five years, working first in film production and later as a journalist with the now-defunct San Juan Star. Now, 26 years after leaving, I returned with a close friend from those days, Larry Luxner. We sought out old friends and haunts, some of which were gone; others, such as El Batey, a graffiti-laden 1960s-era dive bar in historic Old San Juan, are waiting out the pandemic. We snapped selfies by the former Star building, now a decrepit, weed-strewn site.<br />That sad spectacle mirrors the island’s slow economic decline, spurred by its loss of a special industrial tax status, a U.S. Navy base closure and a series of hurricanes, earthquakes and other calamities including a debt crisis. In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans have moved to the mainland U.S. “These are challenges that hardworking, middle-class Puerto Ricans are trying very hard to overcome,” said Maritza González, an attorney, as we sat in Old San Juan’s San Jose Plaza by a 16th-century church. “I am an optimist by nature, which explains why I’m still living in my beautiful island.”<br />The “Isla Borinqueña,” as we discovered, still retains abundant charms, foremost its Spanish-colonial architecture, Caribbean-inflected food, infectious music, a scenic mountainous interior, and of course, warm weather and sandy beaches with clear blue waters.</td>

He said Russia would decide where that line should be drawn.<br />“We really do not want to burn bridges,” Mr. Putin said Wednesday. “But if anyone mistakes our good intentions for indifference or weakness and plans to burn or even blow up those bridges, they should know that Russia will respond asymmetrically, swiftly and harshly.”<br />Russia’s military buildup, mounting cease-fire violations and increasingly heated rhetoric between Moscow and Kyiv have raised concerns of an escalating conflict.<br />Western officials estimate that Russia has deployed between 80,000 and 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border, larger than the force the Russians deployed when they seized Crimea in 2014 and sent troops into eastern Ukraine.</td>

      <td>A powerful cabal of soccer powerhouses crumples amid outrage. Do fans have more power than previously thought?</td>
      <td>Here lies the Super League, a true fish bicycle, a lousy idea wrapped in a somehow lousier idea, a vulgar blast of hubris set to change the sports world as we knew it, only to go kaput after…well, I guess the whole deal lasted two days.<br />If you never got fully caught up: the Super League was a long-promised, finally-executed assembly of 12 name brand European soccer teams, whose leaders hated having to compete with smaller, riff-raff clubs for qualifications and earnings in the sport’s annual Champions League tournament. These clubs craved a fatter, guaranteed slice of the soccer economy, and so they decided, clandestinely, to extricate themselves from long-established league traditions to create a breakaway society, the Super League, that would bar the riff-raff, lock in the name brands versus the name brands, and tickle the wallets of media companies to make a select few richer, richer, richer.<br />As stunts go, the Super League was brazen, a nine-figure yacht with twin helicopter pads barreling into the harbor past the NO WAKE sign. Though the fan outcry was immediate, it appeared to have business momentum, because this is how things go in modern sports. Money, especially media rights money, guides all, and what a proper owner seeks is a plush environment in which the team wins not only when it wins, but also when it loses. The clubs signing on were behemoths: iconic outfits like Chelsea, Liverpool,  Manchester United ,  Barcelona, Real Madrid, AC Milan and more. There were questions about how it would all work, but the Super League seemed too rude to fail.<br />But then it failed. It failed fast and spectacularly, because while the disrupters surely expected pushback, they were shaken by the volume of outrage their idea inspired. This was not new Coke, or clear Pepsi, or another harebrained concept that could easily be ignored in the supermarket—the Super League had the potential to profoundly alter professional soccer, shutting off lesser clubs and stripping away the remote but essential quality of competitive chance. Soccer had long been overtaken by billionaires and oligarchs who’d choked the sport through unlimited spending, but part of what made an imperfect event like the Champions League work was that every team still had to earn its place, and every team could technically qualify.<br />The Super League would bypass the element of surprise for a clubby guarantee, and the people who loved the randomness of the game smelled something foul.</td>

Due to the threat of spreading coronavirus, Mr. Biden nixed the traditionally packed evening balls and other mass events in favor of a televised program featuring actor Tom Hanks and a large public fireworks display, among other festivities.<br />Still, top donors were offered perks including virtual events with Mr. Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and their spouses as well as sessions with top Biden advisers. The Tuesday filing with the Federal Election Commission by the nonprofit inaugural committee is the first full accounting of Biden donors and the amounts they gave.<br />Mr. Biden’s inaugural haul was lower than the record $106 million raised by former President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee in 2017, but it was higher than the $53 million raised for former President Barack Obama’s 2009 inaugural celebration.<br />About half of the money raised by the Biden inaugural committee came from wealthy individuals donating the most the committee allowed—$500,000—or from companies, labor unions and advocacy groups. Beyond large, lump-sum donations, the committee received $12 million, or about 20% of its total, from people giving $200 or less.</td>

One, median wage growth as tracked by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, was 3.4% in February, barely changed from before the pandemic. Another, the Labor Department’s employment cost index, shows earnings up 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with 3% a year earlier. In 2010, both measures of wage growth fell below 2%.</td>

      <td>After a renewable-energy investment binge, further progress depends partly on persuading power developers to keep building while the government still owes them money</td>
      <td>China’s renewable energy has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years, but that has also come with a price: unfunded liabilities. Unless Beijing fixes the problem, green-power stocks—and China’s towering clean-energy ambitions for the next five years—may remain grounded.<br />The country aims to have 16.5% of its power consumption from solar and wind by 2025, a rise from an expected 11% this year, according to a draft policy document released by the government this week. This is in line with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s goal of having a quarter of the country’s energy consumption from non-fossil fuel sources in 2030.<br />And China has been moving in stride toward that goal. It added 72 gigawatt of wind power capacity last year, nearly triple the amount added in 2019. New solar-power installations went up 60% in 2020. One reason for the surge is that the government is phasing out generous subsidies that have been helping the industry, and so developers were rushing to finish projects last year while they still qualified. New onshore wind farms, for example, won’t get any central government subsidies starting this year. With the cost of renewable energy plunging in the past few years, the government is encouraging projects to be cost competitive with fossil fuels.<br />There is a lingering problem with subsidies: a big portion hasn’t been paid out yet. The government has set up a fund to pay them funded by a surcharge on power consumption. But since growth in renewable-energy capacity has been much faster than power demand, the fund has been in deficit for years. The cumulative deficit amounted to 328 billion yuan, or the equivalent of $50 billion, at the end of 2020, according to Credit Suisse estimates.<br />Earlier this year, the government proposed companies write off part of the subsidies owed in exchange for quotas to build new projects. That triggered a selloff in renewable-power companies: China Longyuan Power, the country’s largest wind-power producer, lost a third of its value in four days. The latest policy draft this week doesn’t mention this proposal anymore.</td>

      <td>Plans for a soccer Super League are falling through, but a U.S.-style shakeup would be in the interest of both viewers and top clubs</td>
      <td>The audacious plan by Europe’s top soccer clubs to form their own U.S.-style tournament lies in tatters just days after it was launched. But that might not stop some eventual Americanization of the world’s most popular sport.<br />The six English clubs that had supported the new European Super League pulled out Wednesday, all but sealing its fate. The proposal for a “closed” league inspired by U.S. franchises, featuring weekly face-offs between powerful teams that couldn’t be relegated, would have torpedoed the existing Champions League run by European soccer’s governing body UEFA. It sparked immediate outrage from national leagues, clubs, fans and governments.<br />What the near-universal criticism glossed over is the inadequacy of the status quo—and not just for the most popular clubs’ billionaire owners. The collapse of the Super League might not take much pressure off UEFA to fix problems it has failed to address for decades.<br />Although soccer has a bigger fan base than any other sport globally, the National Football League, Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association all recorded more revenues than any European soccer competition in 2019. This is in part because the MLB and NBA have more matches per season. But the NFL still collected $60 million a game, compared with about $25 million for the Champions League.<br />More than half of that income comes from media companies like Sky—owned by U.S. giant  Comcast —paying for soccer broadcast rights. The Super League expected a more popular format to double the value of these rights, helping soccer clubs plug the financial holes caused by the pandemic.</td>

      <td>S&P 500 and Dow are on track for a muted trading session following two days of declines</td>
      <td>U.S. stock futures wobbled as the global Covid-19 infection rate and potential for new variants fueled concerns about the pace of economic recovery.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average wavered between gains and losses after two straight days of declines. Technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures slid 0.2%.<br />A new wave of Covid-19 infections is sweeping through a number of countries including India and Japan, raising the prospect of fresh hurdles to the anticipated global economic rebound. Health authorities are also warning that new variants may emerge that are resistant to the existing batch of coronavirus vaccines. Given those concerns, investors are putting the brakes to what has been a furious rally in stocks in recent weeks, leaving the major indexes hovering near record highs.<br />“There are still risks in this market, particularly as it relates to the vaccine rollout and virus mutations,” said Shoqat Bunglawala, head of international multiasset investments at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “We’re still likely to be in an environment with some volatility.”<br />Investors are also closely monitoring corporate earnings to see if the current valuations of expensive stocks can be justified.  Verizon Communications  and  NextEra Energy  are among a string of companies scheduled to report quarterly results before the market opens.  Chipotle Mexican Grill  will post earnings after the New York closing bell.</td>

      <td>The EU is proposing one of the first laws globally to regulate the use of artificial intelligence for ‘high risk’ applications like hiring and policing</td>
      <td>The European Union’s executive arm proposed a bill that would limit police use of facial-recognition software in public and ban the marketing or use of certain kinds of AI systems, in one of the broadest efforts yet to regulate high-stakes applications of artificial intelligence.<br />The bill proposed on Wednesday would also create a list of so-called high-risk uses of AI that would be subject to new supervision and standards for their development and use, such as critical infrastructure, college admissions and loan applications. Regulators could fine a company up to 6% of its annual world-wide revenue for the most severe violations, though in practice EU officials rarely if ever mete out their maximum fines.<br />The bill is one of the broadest of its kind to be proposed by a Western government, and part of the EU’s expansion of its role as a global tech enforcer.<br />In recent years, the EU has sought to take a global lead in drafting and enforcing new regulations aimed at taming the alleged excesses of big tech companies and curbing potential dangers of new technologies, in areas ranging from digital competition to online-content moderation. The bloc’s new privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, helped set a template for broadly applied rules backed by stiff fines that has been followed in some ways by other countries—and some U.S. states.<br />Wednesday’s proposal faces a long road—and potential changes—before it becomes law. In the EU, such laws must be approved by both the European Council, representing the bloc’s 27 national governments, and the directly elected European Parliament, which can take years.</td>

      <td>The price of the steelmaking ingredient has surged to a decade high, helping Australia as it navigates trade tensions with Beijing</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—A run-up in the price of iron ore to a decade high is blunting China’s pressure tactics in a major trade dispute.<br />China imposed a series of import restrictions and tariffs on Australian products including barley and beef last year, after being angered by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s call for an international investigation into the first outbreak of Covid-19 in China. But its reliance on iron ore from Australia meant the steelmaking ingredient wasn’t targeted by Beijing.<br />Now, China’s demand for iron ore to feed its steel mills and underpin its economic recovery has driven the industry’s benchmark price to its highest level since February 2011. That is providing a revenue boost to Australia, which accounts for more than 50% of global iron-ore exports, as it navigates tensions with its largest trade partner.<br />The price of iron ore—one of the world’s most traded commodities—rose to $187.75 a metric ton on April 20, according to S&P Global Platts. It has risen 17% over the past month, extending a rally that began when prices were below $100 a ton less than a year ago.<br />“It’s certainly good news for miners and the Australian economy,” said AMP Capital Chief Economist Shane Oliver. He predicted more large trade surpluses for Australia, while iron-ore miners will pay more in tax that will improve Australia’s budget deficit.</td>

Maybe.<br />Leveraged buyout bids measuring in the double-digit billions, a relative rarity since the financial crisis, have been showing signs of a comeback lately.<br />Earlier this month, private-equity firm  CVC Capital Partners submitted a proposal worth more than $20 billion for Japan’s  Toshiba Corp. , setting off a potential auction. Meanwhile, Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners and Sweden’s  EQT  AB have teamed up for a bid on  Royal KPN  NV that could value the Dutch telecommunications company at more than $15 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported.<br />And medical-supply giant Medline Industries Inc. has hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  to help it explore a sale, likely to one or more private-equity firms, the Journal reported. Such a deal could value the family-owned company at as much as $30 billion.<br />It is far from guaranteed that any of these transactions will be completed—and, indeed, on Tuesday Toshiba rebuffed the CVC proposal, but the fact that they are even under consideration is noteworthy. Between 2005 and 2007, private-equity firms inked 18 deals worth $10 billion or more, according to Dealogic. Since then, they have struck only 10, mindful that many of the precrisis deals didn’t work out as planned.</td>

      <td>Brazil’s government, widely criticized by environmental groups as a negligent steward of the Amazon rainforest, has made an audacious offer to the Biden administration: Provide $1 billion and President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration will reduce deforestation by 40%.<br />The proposal was made as the Brazilian president prepares for a virtual environmental summit with roughly 40 heads of state hosted Thursday and Friday by President Biden, who has made battling climate change a centerpiece of his administration. European governments and activists have publicly expressed misgivings with Mr. Bolsonaro’s proposals on the environment because he has trimmed funds for environmental protection agencies amid an increase in deforestation.<br />But supported by some influential scholars and Amazon dwellers, Mr. Bolsonaro argues that the only way to save the jungle is through carbon credits and by financing sustainable economic activities so people can make a living from fish farming, cacao production and other activities that don’t require the razing of trees. The theme has been central to talks Brazil’s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, said he has had in recent weeks with Biden administration climate officials.<br />The request is likely just among the first of many similar to follow as developing nations start to negotiate with industrialized countries about who pays for costly programs to address climate change. This fall, the nations of the world are to set new, more ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, and developing countries want their richer peers to make good on pledges from the original Paris climate negotiations to mobilize $100 billion a year in public and private financing for them.<br />Top Indian officials made that among their top requests to John Kerry, the Biden administration’s special envoy on climate change, when he visited earlier this month, according to the Indian Finance Ministry on Twitter. Officials from these countries, including Brazil, say industrialized nations must account for their historic contributions to climate change and the need for citizens in poorer countries to rise out of poverty.</td>

But, these projects—and their emissions—aren’t going away. Instead, they are being managed by smaller players that often face less environmental scrutiny.

But without the regular disclosures that investment firms typically make after they build up a sizable stake in a stock, those executives didn’t have a way to verify the ownership claim.<br />It might seem surprising that a company can’t pinpoint why its stock suddenly falls, but the Archegos meltdown shows how difficult it can be for executives to determine who owns their company’s stock and for what reason.<br />A chorus of companies and advocacy groups are now calling on regulators to revise financial-disclosure guidelines, particularly around loosely regulated family offices such as Archegos and around the use of derivatives, investor bets linked to stock prices instead of the stocks themselves.</td>

Its future customers would be able to integrate stock trading features into their mobile apps through Embedded’s APIs, or code that allows apps to communicate.<br />Still prelaunch, Vancouver, Wash.-based Embedded has already raised $20 million in several tranches of seed financing over the past 12 months, from investors including Bain Capital Ventures, Propel Venture Partners, Acrew Capital, Homebrew and Y Combinator, as well as venture capitalists Lachy Groom and Josh Buckley. Embedded was valued at $80 million in February, according to Mr. Giles, the company’s chief executive.<br />The startup is entering a complex, regulated business with high capital requirements. It has taken the better part of a year to clear regulatory hurdles required for Embedded to start operating its service. It plans to compete with the likes of Apex Clearing Corp. and DriveWealth LLC.<br />The importance of clearing firms, which hold customer funds as well as clear and settle trade orders, came to the fore when a huge influx in trading in some stocks caused market volatility in late January.

The decision to swiftly release the video was a departure from protocol as the force faces scrutiny from the public following a series of recent high-profile police killings that have led to clashes.<br />The 10-second clip begins with the officer getting out of his car at a house where police had been dispatched after someone called 911 saying they were being physically threatened, Interim Police Chief Michael Woods said at the news conference. The officer takes a few steps toward a group of people in the driveway when the girl, who was Black, starts swinging a knife wildly at another girl or woman, who falls backward. The officer shouts several times at her.<br />The girl with the knife then charges at another girl or woman who is pinned against a car.<br />From a few feet away, with people on either side of him, the officer fires four shots and the teen slumps to the ground.

      <td>Weak subscriber outlook means streaming giant will need a big fall season</td>
      <td>The shows  Netflix  has coming later this year had better be really good.<br />The streaming giant reported disappointing growth in paid subscribers for the first quarter on Tuesday. That alone should not have been a huge surprise; Netflix has missed its own subscriber forecasts about 44% of the time since it instituted its current projection methodology in early 2019. The company has also repeatedly warned that the breakneck expansion fueled by the pandemic last year pulled forward growth from this year.<br />Still, Netflix shares slumped nearly 9% in after-hours trading following the results. The company added slightly under 4 million paid subscribers in the first quarter and projected net additions of just 1 million for the second quarter. That means it could end the first half of the year nearly 6 million subscribers short of where Wall Street thought it would be by that time. Netflix would also require the addition of nearly 21 million subscribers in the second half of 2021 to reach analysts’ year-end target of 229.4 million. Over the past five years, Netflix has averaged about 12.4 million net new subscribers during the second half of the year.<br />In its quarterly shareholder letter Tuesday, Netflix blamed part of this year’s lag on a “lighter content slate” caused by last year’s pandemic-related production shutdowns. The company expects that situation to improve; the latter half of 2021 will see new seasons of “The Witcher” and “Cobra Kai,” and some expect a new season of the company’s blockbuster series “Stranger Things” in that period as well. Of course, the many Netflix competitors now in the market will be executing on similar plans. What’s more, rivals like  Disney  and HBO Max will be adding some movies to their streams on the same day as theatrical release.<br />Netflix did maintain its goal of breaking even on a free-cash-flow basis this year. The company even plans to start buying back stock for the first time since 2012; a $5 billion repurchase program gets under way this year. All are important steps for the undisputed streaming king after more than a decade in the business. But with streaming investors myopically focused on subscriber counts, Netflix will still need a lot of viewers to find their way back indoors later this year.</td>

      <td>Biden cancels offshore projects amid local political opposition.</td>
      <td>President Biden aims to build wind and solar farms from sea to shining sea to replace fossil fuels in the electricity grid by 2035. But his plans are already running aground off the coast of Long Island in New York, where his Administration last week canceled two offshore wind development zones.<br />Bureau of Ocean Energy Management officials said the zones off the island’s coast raised problems with maritime traffic, marine life feeding areas, and concerns over visibility from South Shore beaches. In short, they were a nuisance to fishermen, shippers and gentry with homes in the tony Hamptons area full of Manhattanites during the summer.<br />The feds are portraying the wind rescission as no big deal since other offshore zones between New York and New Jersey are still under review. But these may run into similar problems. Residents in the town of Wainscott have already sued to prevent a transmission line connecting a wind farm off the coast of Montauk from coming ashore on their beach.<br />None of this bodes well for the green energy agenda in New York or nationwide. Gov. Andrew Cuomo is forcing the Indian Point nuclear plant, which has historically provided a quarter of electricity for New York City and Westchester County, to shut down at the end of this month. Yet he’s blocked pipelines to deliver more natural gas to power plants.<br />So how does Mr. Cuomo plan to replace New York City’s nuclear power? Good question. The Governor has proposed building 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind and a 250-mile transmission line from upstate to power New York City with renewable energy. But these projects are sure to face opposition too and won’t be completed anytime soon.</td>

      <td>He unwittingly calls to abolish the corporate and estate taxes.</td>
      <td>Democrats from high-tax blue areas are asking President Biden to restore an unlimited federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), and here’s New York Rep. Jerry Nadler’s pithy pitch on  Twitter : “No one should ever be taxed twice on the same income. It’s not fair and it’s not just.”<br />Deal! Quick, shake on it, before he realizes what he’s saying. Conservatives have been making arguments about double taxation for years. We’re glad to hear Mr. Nadler thinks the death tax and the corporate-income tax are unjust and should be repealed. Also, it’s nice to see him pledge never to vote for any sort of wealth tax.<br />This is a joke, alas. In reality Mr. Nadler is simply trying to reframe the unlimited SALT deduction, which is a tax break for wealthy urbanites mostly in New York and California, as a matter of justice. What makes his complaint especially unpersuasive is that it involves overlapping taxes by different bodies: The federal government has an income tax. So does New York state. So does New York City.<br />This kind of thing happens all the time. Property taxes are assessed by cities, counties, school districts, fire districts and the like. The federal government taxes gasoline, as do states. When you buy a pack of gum, by Mr. Nadler’s logic, the local sales tax should be deducted on the receipt before the state sales tax is calculated.<br />More pernicious double taxation is when the same level of government takes multiple bites, which is what business profits face. Say you own part of a corporation that makes $1. Setting aside deductions and whatnot, the federal corporate tax on that money is 21%, and Mr. Biden wants to make it 28%. When the profits hit your tax return, the feds take another cut, with a top rate of 23.8% on capital gains or qualified dividends.</td>

But while European regulators seem to be learning from their mistakes, the Biden Administration looks to be repeating them.<br />Six cases of severe brain blood clots known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in  Johnson & Johnson  vaccine recipients prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration last week to recommend shots be paused. Similar strokes had been linked with  AstraZeneca ’s  vaccine, which uses similar technology.<br />The agencies said the pause was necessary to notify health-care providers how to treat the unusual clots and give regulators time to review cases. Fair enough. FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock said the pause would only be days, and the White House assured the public it wouldn't frustrate vaccinations. That’s not what happened.<br />The CDC convened a meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices—the same group that set vaccine group priorities—last Wednesday to review incidents and assess their significance. But this isn’t the CDC’s bailiwick, as Journal contributor Scott Gottlieb pointed out in these pages on Monday.<br />The FDA collects safety information after vaccine approval and makes decisions about balancing risks and benefits of medical products. It’s not clear why FDA officials were sidelined or why the CDC punted to a panel of outside experts, but Dr. Woodcock and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky may have been looking for political cover.</td>

      <td>The jury and the justice system again worked far better than political critics behaved.</td>
      <td>A Minneapolis jury on Tuesday convicted former police officer Derek Chauvin on all three counts in the death last May of George Floyd. Many Americans are relieved that justice was done for Floyd, while others breathed a sigh that there won’t be riots as some feared if there was even a partial acquittal.<br />Our conclusion is that the jury and justice system performed better than political critics predicted or behaved themselves as they condoned violent protests and demanded a guilty verdict from afar.<br />Most Americans saw at least some of the disturbing video of Floyd’s death while Mr. Chauvin and other officers restrained him beside a Minneapolis squad car. In convicting Mr. Chauvin of second-degree murder, the jury determined that his actions substantially caused Floyd’s death. They did not have to find that he did so intentionally, but rather that the death occurred in the course of a felony assault.<br />The encounter began when police arrested Floyd on suspicion of passing a fake bill to buy cigarettes. He appeared to be on drugs, and police tried to put him in the back of the police car. He resisted vigorously and asked to be put on the ground. The officers kept him on his stomach, applying pressure to his neck or upper back for more than nine minutes and keeping him there even after he went limp.<br />Expert witnesses differed over the cause of Floyd’s death. The police restraint was the most obvious culprit, but the defense pointed to Floyd’s severe heart disease and that he had recently consumed fentanyl and methamphetamines, which can interfere with cardiopulmonary function. But police witnesses for the prosecution said Mr. Chauvin had violated standard police practice.</td>

She has worked in national-security and law-enforcement jobs for nearly two decades, serving at the end of the Obama administration as the president’s homeland-security adviser after he considered her as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<br />As deputy attorney general, Ms. Monaco will oversee the Justice Department’s operations, including criminal investigations and prosecutions around the country.

      <td>Some Democratic lawmakers have pressed for a permanent change to the payments</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden told a group of lawmakers that he intends to propose a temporary extension of an enhanced child tax credit, rebuffing requests from some Democrats who favor making the new benefit permanent.<br />As part of a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package Democrats passed earlier this year, Congress raised the child tax credit to $3,000 from $2,000, setting it at $3,600 for parents of children under age 6 and making parents of 17-year-olds eligible. The credit, which scales down above certain income thresholds, is fully refundable and was designed to be paid in intervals, rather than in one lump sum.<br />But the expansion of the tax credit, which advocates said would slash child poverty in the U.S. in half, is only set to last through 2021, and some Democrats have sought to make it permanent. Mr. Biden had previously signaled he might also back a permanent expansion.<br />At a meeting at the White House on Tuesday with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Mr. Biden said that he expects that proposing a permanent expansion of the tax credit would run into trouble in the Senate, according to lawmakers at the meeting. When Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D., N.M.) said she asked Mr. Biden about making the expanded tax credit permanent, Mr. Biden said he planned to propose extending it by several years.<br />“He said ‘I’d love to do it permanent, but I’m not sure that I can get that through the Senate,’ ” Ms. Leger Fernandez said. “You could tell he was interested in making it permanent, that was the back and forth on that.”</td>

Instead of huddling at the judge’s bench, private conversations between attorneys and the judge were hashed out over headsets while white noise played to obscure the conversations from the jurors.<br />And instead of sitting close together in a typical jury box, the jurors were spaced out in what looked like school desks.<br />When the verdict was read, Mr. Chauvin sat motionless with a medical mask obscuring most of his face. Only his eyes were observable, darting back and forth as the judge read the verdict. His attorney Eric Nelson looked at Mr. Chauvin after the verdict was read but didn’t touch him before he was handcuffed and led away.</td>

Apparently I need to write something to encourage  AT&T ’s  board to get the company off its suicide mission.<br />At least, that’s the meticulously detailed thesis of Jonathan Chaplin, of the boutique analyst firm New Street Research. Legions of analysts have not bubbled with enthusiasm for AT&T’s foray into video entertainment, with its expensive 2018 acquisition of the Warner studios and HBO streaming network. But Mr. Chaplin makes a case that a charismatic megafauna of the U.S. corporate landscape is not merely a disappointment—it’s headed for disaster due to its distracted decision to underinvest in its core wireless business.<br />To buy his argument, you have to believe the 5G moment is finally arriving thanks to government auction that put midband spectrum into the hands of carriers. You have to believe a tenfold speed difference over sizable swaths of urban and suburban America will be apparent to customers, leading them to flee a carrier that doesn’t keep up as they once did hapless Sprint.<br />You also have to believe (the least speculative part) that a newly enlarged T-Mobile, which inherited Sprint’s remains, holds an exceptionally strong position, thanks to an underutilized network that it can fill with customers poached from  Verizon  and AT&T by offering higher speeds and lower prices.<br />“It’s the Olympics. The Russians are good, the Chinese are really good, but [AT&T] is fine as well,” says Mr. Chaplin, as long as it doesn’t show up “drinking a bottle of scotch and smoking three packs of cigarettes a day.”</td>

      <td>A little spending on the IRS could yield a lot of revenue that’s going uncollected.</td>
      <td>Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Charles Rettig told the Senate Finance Committee last week that the annual gap between taxes owed and taxes paid could be as much as $1 trillion. The so-called tax gap has doubled over the past decade, as IRS resources shrank. The number of IRS employees has declined by 33,000, with more than half of the decrease coming in the hard-pressed enforcement division. As a result, Mr. Rettig says, the IRS is “outgunned.”<br />Official statistics underscore the point, particularly on wealthy filers and corporations. Between 2011 and 2018, the share of returns audited fell by nearly half. For filers earning more than $1 million, audits fell by 74%; for corporations, 42%.<br />But it’s also too easy for taxpayers to underreport their income. Noncompliance rates are less than 5% when the IRS has information from, say, banks that it can use to check taxpayers’ filings. Without such information, only 45% of unreported income ends up taxed. In addition, the IRS is forced to rely on obsolete technology. For example, the IRS receives Schedule K-1 forms, which report income from partnerships and pass-through entities, but it doesn’t have the technology to match these reports to individual tax filings.<br />An additional $1 billion in funding would enable the IRS to hire nearly 5,000 more enforcement personnel. A multiyear program could replace its legacy information technology, among the oldest in the entire federal government. According to Mr. Rettig, such a program would help narrow the tax gap by at least 20%.<br />The principle underlying this initiative—individuals and corporations should pay what they owe—enjoys near-universal support across party lines. The extra revenues could fund much of President Biden’s agenda, without breaching his campaign pledge not to raise taxes on households making less than $400,000 a year or requiring Republicans to walk back their 2017 tax bill.</td>

But there’s an even more worrisome problem: Ships are getting too big.<br />The Ever Given was carrying some 20,000 TEU containers (to use the official term, which stands for “twenty-foot equivalent”) of every conceivable good. Dozens of 20,000-TEU vessels traverse the world’s waterways, putting to shame the 10,000-TEU ships that only a few years ago were queens of the ocean. In 1975, an average of 27 vessels traveled through the Suez Canal each day, carrying an average load of 242 tons. By 2019, 52 ships did so, with an average load of 3,307 tons.<br />Ships’ size is directly linked with consumer demand. Because shipping is cheap and globalization is lifting trade barriers, businesses bring components from various countries to be assembled in another country, then ship finished products all over the world. Consumers expect goods to be delivered at low cost. In the U.K., a South American orange sets the shopper back a mere 30 pence (41 cents). But with small profit margins, shipping companies have to make money on volume. “Bigger ships make shipping more efficient, which feeds global consumption, and when global consumption grows, ships have to grow even more,” said Cormac Mc Garry, a maritime analyst with Control Risks. For the past four years, so-called ultralarge container vessels have accounted for more than half of all ship orders. They serve consumers well—except when they get stuck in narrow canals.<br />Ports are becoming an even bigger concern. They have to expand as ships grow. Today China is home to seven of the world’s 10 largest container ports. Ports along the key Asia-Europe route can already handle freighters carrying 23,500 containers. The Port of Los Angeles, by contrast, is North America’s busiest but ranks only 17th internationally and can’t regularly receive 20,000-container vessels. It also lacks time and infrastructure to receive many more midsize ships.<br />This do-or-die race includes so-called feeder ports, the smaller ports to which cargo travels after arriving in megaports such as Rotterdam, the world’s 11th-largest. In the past a feeder ship typically carried 500 TEUs; now it often carries 1,000 or more. “If ports don’t expand, they lose customers to other ports,” said Nick May, a port expert with the global insurance broker Willis  Towers Watson .  “Today ports need to invest a lot of money to keep going. And if the vessels get any larger, what are the consequences?”</td>

      <td>Tablet and PC sales got a strong boost from the Covid-19 pandemic. Changed work habits should keep demand elevated.</td>
      <td>Apple Inc.’s  new iPad and iMac might seem a bit late to the game, but there is good reason to think they will still find their mark.<br />The two biggest news items coming out of Apple’s Spring Loaded event Tuesday involved updates to what have become the company’s smallest business segments. Apple updated the iPad Pro with its new M1 chip—effectively adding a PC-grade processor to a tablet that typically has been powered with the same chips used in the iPhone. The company also overhauled the design of its iMac for the first time since 2012, adding the M1 chip to its desktop computer lineup.<br />Investors seem unimpressed. Apple’s stock—already a weak performer this year—closed down 1.3% following the event. Indeed, while the Mac and iPad segments still generate annual sales well above $20 billion, they also both now rank below the company’s iPhone, services and wearables segments in size.<br />Both are also facing some rather tough comparisons ahead. The Covid-19 pandemic boosted demand for computing devices across the board as employees and students were sent home. Tablets and PCs enjoyed a strong 2020 overall. Apple’s iPad and Mac revenue jumped 28% and 18% respectively during the calendar year. But that might cool with the return to normalcy. Market tracking firm IDC warned in February that the tablet category “is not expected to retain this momentum in the long term,” as it still faces strong competition from PCs and smartphones. Apple’s iPad revenue fell for six consecutive fiscal years after peaking in 2012.<br />That return might be more gradual, though, when it comes to new working habits following more than a year of lockdown. Many employers are touting a hybrid approach to returning to the office, promising employees more flexibility in working remotely. That will likely keep demand for productivity devices elevated; IDC reported a 55% jump in PC sales in the first quarter of this year. Apple seems to tailor the new iMac especially for the Zoom age, adding a three-microphone array and a beefed-up camera. Wall Street expects both the Mac and iPad segments to boost revenue again for the current fiscal year that ends in September.</td>

      <td>MINNEAPOLIS—Derek Chauvin was convicted on all counts in the killing of George Floyd, a Black man whose death last May in police custody was captured on video that went viral and set off a summer of unrest over law enforcement’s treatment of people of color.<br />Mr. Chauvin sat impassively as Judge Peter Cahill read out the jury’s verdict that he was guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Wearing a mask, the former Minneapolis police officer was handcuffed and taken out of the courtroom after the judge revoked his bail and remanded him to the Hennepin County sheriff’s office.<br />The rare conviction of a police officer on murder charges came in a city on edge from the recent killing of another Black man, Daunte Wright, by a police officer in the suburb of Brooklyn Center. A large police and National Guard presence around government buildings and along commercial corridors across the Twin Cities has been in place for days.<br />Prosecutors built their case largely around a cellphone video that emerged a day after the May 25, 2020 killing. It depicted Mr. Floyd handcuffed and facedown in the street as former officer Chauvin, who is white, knelt on his neck and back for more than nine minutes. Mr. Floyd pleaded for his life, called out to his mother and eventually passed out. Police were responding to a report that Mr. Floyd had used an allegedly counterfeit $20 bill to purchase a pack of cigarettes.<br />Prosecutors were under considerable pressure from activists and politicians to win a murder conviction in the case, even though such verdicts against police officers are rare.</td>

      <td>Daniel Boone despised his reputation as an Indian ﬁghter. He was vastly more proud of his ability to endure the burdens of the huntsman’s life.</td>
      <td>Bob Drury and Tom Clavin together have given us a half-dozen elegantly written narratives of exhilarating episodes in American history, ranging from events in the Indian Wars of the American West to the Korean War. Among their outstanding co-authored works are “The Last Stand of Fox Company: A True Story of U. S. Marines in Combat” (2009) and “The Heart of Everything That Is: The Untold Story of Red Cloud” (2013).<br />For their latest collaboration, Messrs. Drury and Clavin have interwoven the life of the iconic pioneer Daniel Boone with the bloody and brutal early decades of the trans-Appalachian frontier to produce “Blood and Treasure: Daniel Boone and the Fight for America’s First Frontier.” This may be the authors’ finest work to date. Unquestionably, “Blood and Treasure” is among the most redolent of time and place. I felt myself immersed in the sights, sounds and smells of frontier life, as well as the lurking dangers and gruesome deep-forest clashes between grasping frontiersmen and Native Americans defending their country—such are the authors’ keen descriptive powers. Numerous excellent maps enhance the text.<br />Boone was far more complex than most frontiersmen. Unlike many of the thousands of settlers for whom he carved the eponymous Boone’s Trace through the Cumberland Gap and into Kanta-ke—the future Bluegrass State—Boone genuinely admired, and often emulated, the American Indians with whom he clashed, even living among them for a time as an adopted Shawnee. Messrs. Drury and Clavin excel not only in superb portrayals of Boone and his white frontier contemporaries, but also in the evocation of the Eastern Woodland Indians, their way of life and their heart-wrenching efforts to protect their land from white encroachment.<br />A self-aware Boone “had always despised, and would for the rest of his life, his outsize reputation as an Indian fighter,” the authors tell us. “He maintained that dealing with belligerent Native Americans, whether via combat or negotiation, was for the most part a matter of luck and instinct. . . .  He was vastly more proud of his ability to endure the burdens of a huntsman’s life with a seemingly preternatural stoicism.”<br />Boone lived a remarkably long and peripatetic life. The authors correctly choose to focus principally on the tumultuous years between Braddock’s Defeat in 1755 during the French and Indian War—a British disaster that Boone barely escaped with his life—and the end of the American Revolution in 1783. Although a reluctant rebel against Britain, Boone contributed greatly to preserving and ultimately expanding the American grip on the Kentucky country. “Blood and Treasure” offers an engrossing narrative of the Revolutionary War on the trans-Appalachian frontier, and the roles not only of Boone but also of George Rogers Clark, Simon Kenton, the Shawnee chiefs Blackfish and Black Hoof, and a host of other luminaries both Native American and white.</td>

The desire to view things in moralistic terms is so strong that many political commentators recast the past as full of men so evil they must be torn from history’s pages. By contrast, John Lewis Gaddis’s “On Grand Strategy” teaches how to live with their contradictions and understand the environments in which they operated.<br />Many of the freedoms we enjoy today were laid down by those who understood how to follow timeless virtues in the imperfect times in which they lived. Lincoln, in Gaddis’s words, “drew strength from contradictions, maybe because he contained so many. They gave him an amplitude.” If you want to achieve good in the world, or achieve any goal in life, you must learn to embrace your contradictions and those of the world around you, understand them, and power through.</td>

      <td>Voters didn’t always like Trump’s tone, but they broadly supported his strategy at the border.</td>
      <td>Out to lunch. That might be the kindest way to describe Joe Biden and Democrats these days on immigration. If they think they have a voter mandate to reverse restrictions advanced by the previous administration, even with the southern border effectively under siege, they’re kidding themselves.<br />As with other issues—taxes, climate, court-packing—the Biden administration is confusing the nation’s rejection of Donald Trump with an endorsement of a progressive agenda. But if voters wanted far-left policies, the Democratic House majority wouldn’t be so puny, the Senate wouldn’t be evenly split, and Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders would be president.<br />Beltway elites are reluctant to acknowledge it, but Mr. Trump had his ear to the ground on immigration. Voters didn’t always like his tone—and polling suggested they didn’t share his wall fixation—but his prioritization of border security resonated with millions, including many who typically vote for Democrats. Even Democratic strategists have acknowledged that deference to progressives, who by the way are now raising state income taxes to finance five-figure Covid-relief checks for undocumented workers, played a role in the party’s underperformance among Hispanics last year. Mr. Biden ignores all this at his peril.<br />By the time Mr. Trump left office, he had limited to 15,000 the number of refugees admitted annually to the U.S. In February, President Biden said that he would increase the cap to 125,000, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken later reduced to 62,500. Now the administration is having second thoughts about even that lower number, and for good reasons. The number of apprehensions along the southern border in March, more than 171,000, was the highest since 2006.<br />According to the Journal, “the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which runs a network of child-welfare shelters to house unaccompanied minors, has exhausted its $1.3 billion budget for this year as it copes with record numbers of migrant teenagers and children.” Quantitatively, this latest surge isn’t a blip, or something that “happens every year,” which was the initial White House spin. Rather, it’s a full-blown crisis, and it finally looked as if Mr. Biden was starting to treat it that way.</td>

      <td>The venerable term ‘batsman’ has been banished from an ESPN website.</td>
      <td>Many culture wars start as skirmishes in obscure corners of human interaction, sparked by a remark in a lecture at a small university or by an aperçu at a meeting of local officials. Yet the most passionate cultural tussles seem to begin in matters related to sports—as has just happened with cricket, a team game so venerable that even Oliver Cromwell refrained from prohibiting its play in the Puritan years when he governed England. (Cromwell banned other sports, as well as the theater, but halted cricket only on the sabbath.)<br />On April 16, cricket came under the scolding scrutiny of modern-day puritans when ESPNCricinfo.com, the oldest and most popular website dedicated to the game, published an announcement by its editor, Sambit Bal. Mr. Bal declared that his publication would battle “discrimination” by discontinuing the use of a word that has been part of cricket’s lexicon since at least the early 17th century—“batsman,” which, plainly enough, describes the player who uses a bat to hit a ball that’s been hurled at him. The equivalent for baseball is batter, the “gender neutral” word Mr. Bal intends to use instead. The term, he says, “will be updated across all areas of the site.”<br />Mr. Bal writes that “it can be argued” that the word batsman is “not overtly offensive.” When applied to male cricketers, “it is accurate,” just as using “batswoman” for female cricketers is “perfectly palatable.” The problem, he insists, “lies in the sovereignty of one term over another.” The word batsman, he suggests unctuously, sets up a linguistic default mode that is biased against women: Those who bat “are batsmen, unless specified otherwise.” So the word must go.<br />ESPNCricinfo has no official status in the game or its administration. It’s a private publication, owned by the  Walt Disney Co. , that is free to make its own lexical decisions. But with 20 million monthly visitors, it is a behemoth in the coverage of cricket, the only publication that has a sizable following in each of the dizzying range of countries—from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe—where cricket is a passion. Its ability to influence others is considerable.<br />The publication’s switch from “batsman” to “batter” can be said, fairly, to be gratuitous. There is no pattern of complaints from female players, no allegations of sexism. The body that oversees the laws of cricket—known as the Marylebone Cricket Club after the part of London where it’s quartered—undertook its last revision of the game’s rules in 2017. After consulting numerous female players and administrators—who accepted that it was an intrinsic part of the game—the MCC found no reason to do away with the word “batsman.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—House Democrats defeated an effort by Republicans Tuesday to censure Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) over her remarks related to the high-profile trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in the death of George Floyd.<br />In a party-line vote held shortly before Mr. Chauvin was convicted of murder, the House voted 216-210 to table a vote on a resolution censuring Ms. Waters.<br />The dispute centers on comments Ms. Waters made over the weekend at a protest in the Minneapolis area. Ms. Waters said she would urge a more confrontational approach over the U.S. legal system’s treatment of Blacks if the jury, which had begun deliberations in the case, doesn’t return a guilty verdict.<br />“We’re looking for a guilty verdict,” Ms. Waters told reporters. Asked what should happen if there wasn’t a guilty verdict, she said: “We’ve got to get more active. We’ve got to get more confrontational. We’ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.”<br />Ms. Waters later clarified her remarks. “I am nonviolent,” she told theGrio in an interview posted Monday. “I talk about confronting the justice system, confronting the policing that’s going on, I’m talking about speaking up. I’m talking about legislation.”</td>
