      <td>Speaker will appoint the chair and 13 members, with five in consultation with Republicans</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) on Monday introduced the legislative text needed to establish a select committee with subpoena power to investigate the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, in advance of an expected vote in the House on Wednesday.<br />The resolution, which mirrors the language used to create the GOP-led select committee on the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, gives Mrs. Pelosi the ability to appoint the chair and 13 members—five of them “after consultation with the minority leader,” a reference to Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.).<br />Mrs. Pelosi is considering including a Republican lawmaker among Democrats’ eight appointments, according to a Pelosi aide.<br />The speaker had said last week that she would establish a select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, after Senate Republicans blocked an earlier effort to establish a bipartisan independent commission. The bipartisan legislation to establish one passed the House with the support of 35 Republicans, but in the Senate, only six Republicans supported it, leaving the bill short of the 60 votes needed to advance.<br />Former President Donald Trump, along with Mr. McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), had urged Republicans to oppose the commission. The House impeached Mr. Trump in January for inciting insurrection against the U.S. government on Jan. 6, when his supporters stormed the Capitol to stop the ratification of President Biden’s Electoral College win. Mr. Trump was acquitted by the Senate.</td>

      <td>The guaranteed nature of Biden’s spending is the real threat to America’s economic future.</td>
      <td>Sen. Joe Manchin’s public support Sunday for at least $2 trillion in new spending in a partisan budget bill is a huge win for the political left. This means a giant tax-and-spend bill this year is likely, and the biggest expansion of the entitlement state since the 1960s is now possible.<br />The entitlements are by far the biggest long-term economic threat from the Biden agenda. Tax increases can be repealed by a future Congress. Spending on infrastructure will slow as funding falls. The courts may block his racial preferences. But entitlements that spend automatically based on eligibility are nearly impossible to repeal, or even reform, and they represent a huge tax-and-spend wedge far into the future.<br />The media won’t talk about this, and Republicans are so far missing in action. But Americans need to understand the stakes.<br />Hoover Institution scholars John Cogan and Daniel Heil document nearby the entitlement expansions of the Biden Families Plan. It’s an important piece that lists how far the progressive left wants to go in expanding government’s reach into American family life. Federal child care, government paid family leave, free community college, a $3,600 tax credit per child, a permanent expansion of ObamaCare premium subsidies, universal pre-K, permanent expansion of the earned-income tax credit to workers without children, and more.<br />We’d highlight two points. First is the dishonesty about costs. Entitlements always start small but then soar. The Biden Families Plan is even more dishonest than usual.</td>

      <td>A judge tells the agency to come back when it has proof of monopoly.</td>
      <td>What an embarrassment. Federal Judge James Boasberg Tuesday threw out the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit seeking to break up  Facebook  after finding the agency failed Antitrust 101: Demonstrating a monopoly.<br />The FTC sued Facebook in December under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which makes it unlawful for a company to “monopolize, or attempt to monopolize” a market. The lawsuit says Facebook acquired Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014) to neutralize future competitors. As evidence, the FTC cited statements by CEO Mark Zuckerberg such as “It is better to buy than compete.”<br />We said the FTC lawsuit was weak, not least because the FTC had approved Facebook’s $1 billion Instagram purchase in 2012. Most WhatsApp users are overseas, and Facebook’s own instant-messaging app still has four times more users in the U.S.<br />The more basic problem, as Judge Boasberg notes, is that the agency failed to show that Facebook has a monopoly in social media, which is step one in bringing an antitrust suit under Section 2. While the government claimed Facebook had a more than 60% market share in the “Personal Social Networking Services” market, it didn’t detail the metrics or methods it used to calculate this figure.<br />“Such an unsupported assertion might (barely) suffice in a Section 2 case involving a more traditional goods market, in which the Court could reasonably infer that market share was measured by revenue, units sold, or some other typical metric,” the judge writes. “But this case involves no ordinary or intuitive market.”</td>

Mr. Trump isn’t expected to be charged at this time, said his lawyer, Ronald Fischetti.<br />During virtual meetings last week and Monday with prosecutors, lawyers for the Trump Organization argued that charging companies for neglecting to pay taxes on fringe benefits was unheard of.<br />“In my more than 50 years of practice, never before have I seen the district attorney’s office target a company over employee compensation or fringe benefits,” Mr. Fischetti said in a statement. “Even the financial institutions responsible for causing the 2008 financial crisis, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, were not prosecuted.”</td>

      <td>The results of regional elections should worry President Macron.</td>
      <td>Since Emmanuel Macron trounced Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election, a 2022 rematch has appeared likely. But the final round of France’s regional elections this weekend showed that the old establishment still has some fight left in it.<br />Mr. Macron’s centrist party and Ms. Le Pen’s right-wing National Rally failed to win a single regional presidency. Traditional center-right politicians held on to seven regions, while the Socialist Party won five. Perhaps the only reassuring news for the President and his most prominent rival is that a record low 35% of voters took part in the second round, down from well over 50% in 2015.<br />The results shouldn’t lead to major policy changes, as incumbent parties were re-elected and regional governments powers are limited mostly to transportation and education. But after being wiped out in the 2017 legislative and presidential elections, these traditional parties have reason for optimism ahead of April’s presidential vote.<br />The center-right Xavier Bertrand, president of the northern Hauts-de-France region, dunked on Ms. Le Pen’s party in his victory speech. He also confirmed his presidential ambitions, saying the “result gives me the strength to go and seek the support of all the French.” He currently polls at third place with 16%, or about 10 points behind Ms. Le Pen and Mr. Macron.<br />French politics is unpredictable—Mr. Macron was relatively unknown a year before his 32-point victory over Ms. Le Pen—and the presidential runoff system can produce a big majority for a candidate with little enthusiastic support. In 2017 Mr. Macron benefited from the front républicain, or parties uniting behind him to keep Ms. Le Pen from power. But unease about Islam and immigration have moved the French electorate to the right.</td>

      <td>Undoing an 8% top rate, while flattening the tax code, is a big deal.</td>
      <td>This week Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey will sign a 2.5% flat tax, a moment that will define his legacy. The bill’s passage was worth the political drama and will go far to maintain Arizona’s competitiveness.<br />Arizona currently taxes income under a progressive rate structure, starting at 2.59% up to 4.5%. The ballot last November carried an initiative to add a 3.5% surtax on earnings above $250,000 for single filers. It narrowly passed, meaning the combined top rate was set to hit 8%, higher than all of Arizona’s neighbors except California. Nevada and Texas have no income tax.<br />Mr. Ducey’s budget will cut rates for all taxpayers. The Legislature can’t repeal the voter-approved surtax, so above the 2.5% flat rate, there will still be a second bracket on income over $250,000. But the budget also has a provision adjusting the flat tax downward for those Arizonans, so no one will pay a top rate above 4.5%. That’s the same as today.<br />Republicans control the Legislature by two seats in each chamber, so a single GOP defector could block the bill. The House split 30-30 on an earlier version of the budget, with one Republican voting no and arguing that the state should pay down more debt. A second attempt to pass the flat tax failed when Democrats decided not to show up, leaving the House without an in-person quorum, since some GOP lawmakers planned to dial in remotely.<br />The bill eventually passed the House last Thursday, after tweaks that won over the GOP holdouts. No Arizonan will have to pay the threatened 8% rate, since the provisions forestalling it are immediate. The 2.5% flat tax will be phased in by 2024, provided state revenue stays strong. Cities, which receive a cut of income-tax proceeds, will get 18% instead of the current 15%.</td>

      <td>For the first time in history, more than half of all Americans would be on the federal dole.</td>
      <td>The federal government’s system of entitlements is the largest money-shuffling machine in human history, and President Biden intends to make it a lot bigger. His American Families Plan—which he recently attempted to tie to a bipartisan infrastructure deal—proposes to extend the reach of federal entitlements to 21 million additional Americans, the largest expansion since Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society.<br />For the first time in U.S. history—except possibly for the pandemic years 2020 and 2021, for which we don’t yet have data—more than half of working-age households would be on the entitlement rolls if the plan were enacted in its current form. Contrary to Mr. Biden’s assertion that his plan “doesn’t add a single penny to our deficits,” his plan would add more than $1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.<br />The American Families Plan proposes several new entitlement programs. One promises students the government will pick up the entire cost of community-college tuition; another promises families earning 1.5 times their state’s median income that Washington will cover all daycare expenses above 7% of family income for children under 5; still another promises workers up to 12 weeks of federally financed wage subsidies to take time off to care for newborns or sick family members.<br />The American Families Plan would follow longstanding government practice and make temporary emergency programs permanent. In March, Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan, which expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies and refundable tax credits for child care and low-wage workers. The expansions were sold as temporary measures to combat the effects of pandemic lockdowns. A month later, Mr. Biden asked Congress to make them permanent.<br />These programs extend eligibility for benefits high up the income ladder. Two-parent households with two preschool-age children and incomes up to $130,000 would qualify for federal cash assistance for daycare. Single parents with two preschoolers and incomes up to $113,000 would qualify. And some families with incomes over $200,000 would be eligible for health-insurance subsidies. Other parts of the plan, such as paid leave and free community college, have no income limits at all.</td>

They also committed to buying tens of billions of dollars of their own stock.<br />Morgan Stanley  led the way, doubling its quarterly dividend to 70 cents a share and announcing plans to buy back up to $12 billion of its stock in the next 12 months. Morgan Stanley shares jumped 2.6% in after hours trading.<br />Citigroup Inc.  was the lone megabank not to increase its dividend, keeping it unchanged at 51 cents but leaving the door open for an increase. It didn’t announce a new buyback plan. Its stock, already trailing the other big bank gains this year, fell after hours nearly 1%.<br />The Fed last week said 23 of the largest banks had adequate capital to withstand a crisis, a necessary hurdle for banks to pass to return money to shareholders. The central bank had restricted shareholder payouts during the pandemic, asking banks to preserve capital in case the recession led to a wave of soured loans.</td>

      <td>He evidently decided a show of hatred was his only hope. But he proved unable to pull it off.</td>
      <td>The Democratic primary for New York mayor doesn’t have an official winner. But it has some losers, among them Shaun Donovan, who claimed 2% of the vote.<br />Mr. Donovan boasted quite a résumé. He attended the prestigious Dalton School before earning three degrees from Harvard: a bachelor’s in engineering, a master’s in public administration and a master’s in architecture. He was Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s housing commissioner and President Obama’s housing secretary and budget director.<br />Mr. Donovan tried to position himself as progressive yet competent and conciliatory. He didn’t get far. An email to supporters sums up his campaign nicely. The subject line: “Experts agree!” The first line of the email quotes the  New York Times : “Political observers agree that Mr. Donovan has the credentials of a top mayoral candidate.” The full sentence in the Times article, if you bothered to find it, read: “Many political observers agree that Mr. Donovan has the credentials of a top mayoral candidate, but still has not been able to connect with voters.”<br />I mention this to relate a bizarre episode from Mr. Donovan’s campaign, such as it was. The Journal’s editorial page editor invited several mayoral candidates to discuss their views and prospects. The exchanges were mostly lively and engaging. The meeting with Mr. Donovan took place on March 17 via Zoom. It was a polite discussion in all respects but one.<br />As the meeting began, the candidate expressed a need to preface his remarks with a denunciation of his hosts. Mr. Donovan told us he was “deeply concerned” about our “willful disregard for facts but also the willful turning a blind eye to the racist and un-American and not consistent with our values as New Yorkers as a city of tolerance that occurred over the past few years.” He falsely claimed the editorial board had endorsed Donald Trump’s use of the term “Kung Flu” and had therefore contributed “to the hate crimes we see even yesterday in Atlanta.”</td>

      <td>Repealing the SALT cap would direct money away from Washington and toward states and localities.</td>
      <td>Will President Biden seek to repeal the $10,000 cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes, known as SALT? Many conservatives say the SALT cap, part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, should remain in place because repeal would primarily aid high-income households in Democratic states. Open and shut case for Republicans, right? Not so fast.<br />For one thing, they should support any change in the tax code that reduces the burden on the rich. Precisely because they’re already wealthy, the rich are most capable of investing unspent wealth. By reducing their tax burden, repeal of the SALT cap would expand the capital base that matches commercial ideas with investment.<br />The standard argument against repealing the cap is that low-tax, mostly Republican-leaning states would end up subsidizing waste in high-tax Democratic ones. That’s one way of looking at it—the wrong way. It ignores that the top 1% of taxpayers account for around 40% of federal tax revenue. They, not their states, would receive the benefit of the SALT deduction.<br />At the same time, Republicans have long believed that the federal government should be limited in size and scope so that Americans exercise democratic choice at the state and local level. Cities and states, in this view, should be the laboratories for domestic policy.<br />Repealing the SALT cap might not restore that vision, but it would direct money away from Washington and toward states and localities. The SALT cap is manna from heaven for national politicians eager to expand the federal government, all the while shrinking the ability of cities and states to tax, and therefore to control their own policies. Basically the cap turns the Founders’ vision of a federal government with powers “few and defined” on its ahead.</td>

It seemed a good idea at the time, especially after the transformations of the dictatorships in Taiwan and South Korea into messy but functioning democracies. But as Joe Biden is now finding out, Chinese President Xi Jinping operates from a very different premise: that the West has had its day, and Beijing’s blend of Communist Party rule and state capitalism is the ticket to Make China Great Again.<br />He appears to be getting away with it. Under Mr. Xi, Beijing has carried out genocide against China’s Uyghur minority, threatened Taiwan with invasion, shut down a pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong, covered up the origins of Covid-19, and so on. Even so, China’s economy continues to boom—it grew more than 18% in the first quarter from a year earlier—and Friedman now looks to have gotten it colossally wrong about capitalism and freedom.<br />Or did he?<br />In reality Friedman was never as deterministic as sometimes portrayed. While he did maintain that a free society couldn’t exist without a free economy, he emphasized that the opposite didn’t hold: A free economy could exist without political freedom.</td>

      <td>The company’s founders developed a way to inhale nicotine without the tar. In risk-averse America, that wasn’t good enough.</td>
      <td>Two Stanford graduate students on a smoke break in 2004 had an idea: a less lethal cigarette. Adam Bowen and James Monsees knew that people “smoke for the nicotine but die from the tar.” The pair set out to deliver a nicotine buzz without combustion and the 70 carcinogens in cigarette smoke. The firm Messrs. Bowen and Monsees founded, known now as Juul Labs, is among the most reviled enterprises in the country, accused of hooking teenagers on nicotine and castigated by trial lawyers, politicians, anti-tobacco groups and affluent parents.<br />Jamie Ducharme’s “Big Vape: The Incendiary Rise of Juul” is a capably reported and readable account of the company’s origins and current battles. Public-health experts were split between harm-reduction enthusiasts and anti-nicotine fundamentalists. Juul’s potent, smooth nicotine salt “kept smokers satisfied,” unlike weaker competitors, but nonsmokers who were “experimenting” could take a heavy hit. There were no long-term studies about the health effects of “vaping,” or inhaling vapor instead of smoke. But a 2015 study from Public Health England, which Ms. Ducharme, a writer for Time magazine, mentions, found that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than cigarettes.<br />Messrs. Bowen and Monsees built the company in fits and starts, and Juul ran ads in 2015 that made its device “look like an object of desire” for cool young adults. Juul dumped the ads and started running testimonials from former smokers, but that didn’t stop anti-tobacco groups from accusing the company of pitching its product to teenagers. If Juul “had a target on its back,” Ms. Ducharme writes, that’s because “it had put one there.”<br />Juul committed $30 million to youth prevention, removed most flavored offerings from convenience stores, hardened online age-verification, left social media, and endorsed raising the buying age to 21. All of this was received by groups like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids as insufficient, insincere or both, and maybe it was. But what would have been enough?<br />At times, Juul was caught coming and going. The company resisted hiring people with experience in the regulated tobacco industry, ostensibly out of contempt for Big Tobacco. Someone with that background might have helped the company avoid its advertising blunders and better manage e-cigarette regulation the Food and Drug Administration was writing. But then “the disruptor” Juul became “the co-conspirator,” Ms. Ducharme says, accepting in 2018 a $12.8 billion investment from cigarette-maker Altria, designed in part to lend Juul regulatory expertise.</td>

      <td>Judge rules that Federal Trade Commission and states didn’t make valid claims that Facebook engaged in unlawful monopolization</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal judge on Monday dismissed antitrust lawsuits the federal government and most states filed against  Facebook Inc.,  a major win for the company before the cases even got off the ground.<br />U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington granted the social-media giant’s requests to dismiss lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general in December. The dismissals, which came in a pair of rulings, came before any pretrial proceedings had progressed.<br />Judge Boasberg said the FTC’s lawsuit was “legally insufficient” because it didn’t plead enough allegations to support monopolization claims against Facebook. The judge, however, said the commission can try again and gave it 30 days to attempt to file an amended lawsuit.<br />The judge dismissed the states’ case in its entirety, largely on the grounds that the attorneys general waited too long to bring their claims.<br />The rulings dealt a direct, early blow to bipartisan government efforts to pursue Big Tech giants on allegations they have unlawfully monopolized the marketplace. They also served as a reminder that antitrust cases—particularly against dynamic tech-sector firms that offer free, nontraditional products—can be difficult to win before federal courts that have narrowed the reach of antitrust laws over several decades.</td>

      <td>Tyler, the Creator celebrates and confronts his past on an album that hearkens back to the mixtape rap of the early 2000s.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />Early on, media-savvy rapper, producer and mogul Tyler, the Creator (born Tyler Okonma and raised in Los Angeles County), like so many musical artists before him, knew that controversy was a great way to get attention when no one knows who you are. Between 2007 and 2010, his mostly teenage collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, which included eventual stars like rapper Earl Sweatshirt and singer Frank Ocean, issued a string of influential homemade mixtapes. Much of the music coming from the camp featured shocking lyrics filled with homophobia, misogyny and violent imagery—the grisly B-movie stories of hip-hop’s horrorcore subgenre were a point of comparison—only some of which seemed played for laughs. Tyler’s full-length debut LP, 2011’s “Goblin,” picked up where the early work left off in terms of its grim subject matter.<br />Had he stuck with the shock tactics—Eminem was a major influence—Tyler, now 30 years old, probably would have remained a cult artist. But with each new release he has let more of his personality show, and his musical talent developed in parallel. His 2017 record, “Flower Boy,” was newly vulnerable and easily his best work to that point, and with 2019’s “Igor” he snagged both a Grammy and had his first No. 1 LP on the Billboard 200.</td>

Some of those laws are set to take effect on Thursday.<br />The NCAA move continues a period of furious change that intensified last week ago with a landmark Supreme Court decision in which justices unanimously said the NCAA had unlawfully limited schools from competing for player talent by offering better benefits, harming college athletes in the process.<br />In a meeting Monday to address the rapidly changing environment surrounding college athlete rights, the NCAA Division I Council proposed an “interim policy” for the association that would suspend a bylaw that prohibits athletes from monetizing their name, image and likeness. The proposals must be approved by the NCAA Board of Directors, which meets Wednesday.<br />“While opening NIL activities to student-athletes, the policy leaves in place the commitment to avoid pay-for-play and improper inducements tied to choosing to attend a particular school,” said the NCAA in a statement.</td>

The U.S. last month imposed sanctions on officials in Ethiopia, one of its key allies on the African continent, pointing to allegations of widespread atrocities against civilians in Tigray.<br />It was unclear how the Tigrayan forces would respond to the cease-fire declared by the government of Ethiopia’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.<br />There was also no immediate response from neighboring Eritrea, whose troops have been fighting alongside the Ethiopians and whose leader, Isaias Afwerki, has been a longtime opponent of the Tigrayan rebels.</td>

The company in March 2020 ceased publication in the U.S. of its print magazine, which had struggled with profitability for years.</td>

Wisconsin is a top presidential battleground and was narrowly carried by Mr. Biden in 2020. It is also home to Sen.

Some Republican senators had said that threat could undermine their support.<br />Underscoring the fight over the two tracks, in a statement Monday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Mr. Biden should push congressional Democratic leaders to also delink the fate of the bipartisan bill from the broader antipoverty plan.</td>

He said the firm had been forced to halt operations, and that the company would need “a substantial amount of time” to retrieve the missing funds. He urged investors to avoid taking legal action as that might delay the recovery of the money.<br />Investors quickly hired lawyers. One group retained a South African firm to try to figure out what happened to the tokens. Darren Hanekom, a lawyer at the firm, says he believes that Africrypt, or a syndicate of which it was a part, controlled a blockchain address that at one point held assets worth $3.6 billion but now holds nothing. Raees Cajee said Africrypt has never managed that much money for its clients.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court declined on Monday to consider a Virginia school board’s plea to exclude a transgender boy from the men’s bathroom.<br />The closely watched case centered on Gavin Grimm, who twice won decisions at the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Richmond, Va., after the Gloucester County school board imposed policies limiting him to the girls’ room or a stand-alone unisex lavatory.<br />The court, in a brief written order, said it wouldn’t consider the case. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito indicated they would have heard the board’s appeal.<br />“Being forced to use the nurse’s room, a private bathroom, and the girls’ room was humiliating for me, and having to go to out-of-the-way bathrooms severely interfered with my education,” Mr. Grimm said in a statement through the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented him in court. “Trans youth deserve to use the bathroom in peace without being humiliated and stigmatized by their own school boards and elected officials.”<br />A Gloucester County school board representative couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.</td>

      <td>Stock jumps on support from Broadcom, MediaTek and Marvell, but fate of Arm Holdings deal still a question mark</td>
      <td>It says something when investors seem genuinely surprised that not everyone is opposed to  Nvidia ’s  planned takeover of Arm Holdings.<br />Nvidia’s share price jumped 5% Monday afternoon following a report that  Broadcom ,   MediaTek  and  Marvell Technology  have voiced support for its proposed deal to buy Cambridge, Mass.-based Arm from  SoftBank Group .  The Sunday Times reported positive comments from Nvidia’s three fellow chip makers over the weekend. The deal is under national security review by U.K. authorities, with a report due July 30. Regulators in the U.S. and China also will have to clear the transaction for it to go forward.<br />Industry opposition has been seen as a major impediment to the proposed deal, which was announced last September. The acquisition would give Nvidia—now the world’s second-largest chip company by market capitalization—control over a key technology that powers the bulk of the world’s mobile devices and that also is making large inroads into markets such as personal computers and data centers.  Qualcomm ,  Google and  Microsoft ,  all of which use Arm-based chips in their products, are reportedly opposed to the arrangement.<br />Against this backdrop, positive comments from any peer qualifies as “a big step forward” for the proposed deal, according to Citi analyst Atif Malik. But that support seems lukewarm at best. Only MediaTek Chief Executive Rick Tsai was quoted as saying the chip industry would benefit from the combination. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan simply noted that “Nvidia has assured the industry” that it will grow its investment in Arm and continue licensing the technology on a fair basis. Marvell chief Matt Murphy told the paper he was counting on regulatory authorities to address the industry’s concerns, but that he “wouldn’t be sad” to see the deal blocked. However, in a statement sent to The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Mr. Murphy said he was supportive of the deal.<br />Support from others could still be forthcoming.  Apple  Inc.,  which uses Arm processors in its iPhones, iPads and now Mac computers, has yet to publicly comment on the transaction. But the deal still faces long odds given the need for approval from governments that are now approaching the semiconductor business with a more nationalistic bent. In a note to clients Monday, Citi’s Mr. Malik called China the biggest hurdle to the transaction, saying that country is “less likely to support a deal that would see them potentially losing access to Arm.” But he still raised his probability of the merger closing to 30% from 10%.</td>

      <td>After the FDA approved a controversial new Alzheimer’s drug earlier this month, doctors are fielding lots of questions about it from patients and their caregivers.<br />The drug, called Aduhelm, removes amyloid, a sticky substance in the brain that is a defining feature of Alzheimer’s disease. But some doctors say it’s unclear whether removing amyloid will actually slow the progression of the disease. Clinical trials yielded mixed results.<br />Alzheimer’s, a progressive brain disorder that affects memory and cognitive skills, is the most common cause of dementia. Its biological hallmark is sticky protein clusters—called amyloid plaques—in the brain, as well as tangles of fibers, composed of tau protein.<br />We asked doctors what patients need to know about the new drug—and what questions they should be asking their doctors.<br />Aduhelm, made by  Biogen ,  is a monthly infusion that can be done at an infusion center or a doctor’s office. It’s unclear how long patients would need to take it; the clinical trials ended after a year.</td>

Union leaders have said they would like to organize new battery plants and factories owned by electric-vehicle startups.</td>

The court also turned away notable cases involving work-from-home income taxes and marijuana.<br />In the excessive-force case, the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis had dismissed a lawsuit filed by Nicholas Gilbert’s parents, concluding that the officers acted reasonably after finding Mr. Gilbert apparently attempting to hang himself while in a holding cell.<br />Several officers responded, but Mr. Gilbert, 5’3” and 160 pounds, resisted, and a struggle ensued. Ultimately, officers shackled Mr. Gilbert and held him on his stomach.<br />“Three officers held Gilbert’s limbs down at the shoulders, biceps, and legs. At least one other placed pressure on Gilbert’s back and torso. Gilbert tried to raise his chest, saying, ‘It hurts. Stop,’” the court’s unsigned opinion said.</td>

      <td>Re-entering it will be harder than most people imagine. Here’s how to prepare.</td>
      <td>‘No deal is better than a bad deal,” then-Secretary of State John Kerry opined during nuclear negotiations for the Obama administration with Iran before ultimately clinching the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2015. Now, as discussions about returning to the JCPOA drag on, President Biden should prepare for a no-deal outcome.<br />Whether supportive of President Obama’s agreement or President Trump’s withdrawal from it in 2018, many assumed Tehran would rejoin some version of the deal, driven by a desire for economic benefits or diplomatic cooperation.<br />Yet getting back into the original agreement was never going to be so easy. Iran’s nuclear program has advanced much further than the JCPOA accounted for. The original deal has no provisions regarding Iran’s extra enrichment and centrifuge manufacturing facilities, nor the irreversible know-how Iranian scientists have gathered from operating advanced centrifuges in violation of the deal.<br />“The Iranian program has grown, become more sophisticated,” Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned last month. “Linear return to 2015 is no longer possible.” Tehran’s continued stonewalling of investigations into its nuclear weapons work will, “at a minimum, severely complicate” returning to the JCPOA, in the words of the Biden administration. Iran also insists it should be allowed to continue using advanced centrifuges for nuclear enrichment, well beyond what the JCPOA permitted. But the White House wants these machines destroyed.<br />Meanwhile, the U.S. has expanded its sanctions on Iran’s vital banking and energy sectors, as well as its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. These entities would remain blacklisted for ties to terrorism even if Washington lifts all the JCPOA’s nuclear-related sanctions. The Biden administration’s position that many U.S. sanctions—hundreds, according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken—will remain on the books is irreconcilable with Iran’s demand for total economic relief before rolling back its nuclear breaches.</td>

      <td>Some other banks are pushing for employees to return to the office</td>
      <td>UBS Group  AG  will allow around two-thirds of its staff to mix working from home and the office as an employment perk after determining it won’t hurt productivity.<br />The Swiss bank, a big employer in several countries including the U.S., told staff on Monday about its commitment to flexible working. It marks a departure from other major banks, including  Morgan Stanley ,   Bank of America  Corp.  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  that are pressuring employees to return to the office as coronavirus lockdowns and safety measures ease.<br />UBS in an internal announcement said staff whose roles, tasks and locations allow it will be offered the option of hybrid working from the office and from home. It is rolling the program out across countries in coming months. The bank said the flexibility would still be subject to other approvals, such as by line managers, and “doesn’t mean that you can work wherever and whenever you want.”<br />The bank looked into moving to a hybrid model in response to employees saying they wanted more flexibility on a permanent basis, and that the practice would make it a more attractive employer. It also said it already has reviewed which roles could be done on a hybrid basis and those that can’t, such as in-branch personnel and some regulated jobs.<br />The move is being championed by Ralph Hamers, who started as chief executive in November. After the onset of the pandemic last year forced many employees to plug in from home, UBS executives had said teams adapted quickly to interacting with each other and clients via video calls and other digital channels. Its executives were among those making early predictions that flexible working would be permanent.</td>

      <td>From scrappy DIY versions to extravagantly expensive designer models, once-mockable jorts are a big summer trend for men. Here’s why.</td>
      <td>IN THE WORLD of men’s fashion, what was once mockable is now covetable. The polarizing fanny pack, traditionally worn by cheesy tourists, has been elevated to a men’s “It Bag” on the runways at Prada, Fendi and Gucci. Crocs, the risible shoes favored by chefs and families vacationing along the Jersey Shore, have morphed into a hot-ticket item thanks in part to collaborations with Balenciaga and Justin Bieber. And now, jorts—those frumpy jean shorts worn by beer-clutching dads behind the barbecue—have wormed their way into style.<br />“Jean shorts are definitely making a comeback for summer 2021,” said Janine Chilton-Faust, the global VP of men’s design at Levi’s, which offers jean shorts in a range of fits from slim to baggy. Currently, the youth-leaning retailer Asos sells over 200 styles of men’s jean shorts online for as low as $10. Store-bought jorts (as opposed to homemade ones) can be either cleanly hemmed or tattered and frayed in the style of traditional cutoffs. If splurging on the latter is in the cards, consider an $850 gray-black pair from French haute-house Saint Laurent or a $595 wan blue pair with appliqued skeleton bones running up the side from Japanese label Kapital. Act fast on those Kapitals though—they’re low in stock on e-tailer Mr Porter.<br />Handup Gloves, an outdoor gear company in Chattanooga, Tenn., sells $40-ish jorts that “fly off the shelves,” according to head of marketing Troy Stewart. It was nostalgia that compelled Handup to create jorts. Mr. Stewart and his coworkers fondly recalled wearing jorts all summer back in the 1980s and ’90s “to cruise around the neighborhood,” he said. Despite being an outdoor company, Handup builds its cotton-blend jorts more for leisure than performance. “It’s not a pair of  Lululemon  shorts,” said Mr. Stewart. (With that said, jorts are actually a surprisingly popular choice for athletic activities. If you search #jorts on Instagram, you’ll uncover a lot of he-man gym rats bench-pressing in tattered denim cut-offs.)<br />Nostalgia is also what pushed Aaron Levine back to jorts. “They harken back to a simpler time,” said the 44-year-old menswear designer who until recently worked at  Abercrombie & Fitch .  Jorts are “a bit of a ’70s situation, worn with a Faith No More T-shirt or a big polo,” he said. Mr. Levine did stress that his chosen homemade cutoffs are a bit longer now than they would’ve been in the ’70s when Daisy Duke-esque skimpiness prevailed—even for men.<br />Mr. Levine recently wore his fraying jorts to dinner at the Odeon in New York City, a see-and-be-seen restaurant that sells $35 lobster rolls and $16 cucumber martinis. Yet, Mr. Levine didn’t hear a disparaging word about his fraying cutoffs from the management or otherwise. Instead, his dinner mates just asked where they could get a pair.</td>

      <td>Occasional airstrikes can’t make up for empowering Tehran.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s decision to strike Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria over the weekend was a necessary tactical move. But his strategy of empowering Tehran through nuclear negotiations muddles the deterrence message.<br />The early Monday morning strikes “targeted operational and weapons storage facilities” used by groups like Kataib Hezbollah that are targeting American personnel and facilities in Iraq, according to the Pentagon. “The United States took necessary, appropriate, and deliberate action designed to limit the risk of escalation—but also to send a clear and unambiguous deterrent message.” The militias’ use of explosive drones has become a particularly vexing threat.<br />The U.S. air strikes, and similar ones in February, won’t stop the Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria. The goal of these groups, which are financed by Tehran, is to drive the U.S. from Iraq, where about 2,500 American troops are helping to fight Islamic State at Baghdad’s request. But strikes can degrade the militias’ ability to launch attacks. The groups may be willing to absorb the damage, but inaction would invite even greater aggression.<br />The strikes come as Congress is moving to repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq. “As a matter of domestic law, the President took this action pursuant to his Article II authority to protect U.S. personnel in Iraq,” the Defense Department statement said. That’s sufficient legal justification, but it won’t satisfy anti-defense Democrats or isolationist Republicans.<br />Although it’s unwise for Capitol Hill to make battlefield decisions, a new authorization could be a healthy democratic exercise that enhances American security—so long as such legislation grants the President expansive power to strike these militias and respond to other threats.</td>

      <td>Battling extreme heat at the U.S. trials, more than 100 athletes qualified for the Games that start next month, where high temperatures are expected to be a factor.</td>
      <td>EUGENE, Ore.—As extreme temperatures at the U.S. track and field trials here provided a surprise preview of the sweltering conditions expected at the Tokyo Olympics this summer, blazing performances from freshly minted Team USA members showed they are capable of generating plenty of their own heat.<br />The huge squad that qualified for Tokyo over the past week, plus six marathoners, will likely make up nearly one-quarter of the more than 600 overall expected to head to Tokyo for Team USA, or more than 130 athletes. That would be the U.S.’s biggest Olympic track team ever, according to Olympic historian Bill Mallon. The full team will be named later this week.<br />The U.S. squad is headlined by a group of sprinters aiming to fill the giant void left by the absence of Usain Bolt. The retired Jamaican superstar will be absent from the Games for the first time since 2000, after winning the 100-meter and 200-meter golds at the last three Olympics.<br />That creates a lane for new stars like top U.S. women’s 100-meter qualifier Sha’Carri Richardson to grab attention. The 21-year-old Dallas native has previously raced with blue and red hair, and at the trials sported flowing, flame-orange locks. Richardson will bring to Tokyo the second-fastest time in the world this year behind two-time Olympic gold medalist Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce of Jamaica.<br />Trayvon Bromell is the fastest man in the world this year and clocked a 9.80 time in the trials’ 100-meter final. He finished eighth in the 100 at the 2016 Rio Olympics but later aggravated a heel injury and left the track in a wheelchair. Bromell, who turns 26 next month, has raced intermittently since then as he battled serious injuries.</td>

      <td>Economic recovery tops a good run for party, but inflation, coronavirus, a hungry GOP and political liabilities with working-class voters hold risks</td>
      <td>Almost six months into President Biden’s first year, some yellow warning lights are flashing for Democrats.<br />The president’s party has plenty to feel good about, to be sure. The economy’s recovery from the coronavirus slide is proceeding apace, and the stock market, which former President Donald Trump predicted would collapse upon his departure, actually is up 10% since the Biden inaugural. Mr. Biden’s approval ratings are solid, and the infrastructure deal struck last week with Senate Republicans has the potential to become a long-sought bipartisan achievement.<br />Yet Democrats control Congress by the narrowest of margins, and face a Republican congressional leadership intent, above all, on winning back control in next year’s midterm elections. They are probing for Democratic weak spots—and finding some.<br />Mr. Biden’s win last year masked Democrats’ continuing problems with working-class voters, the party’s traditional base. Despite his image as a working-class kind of guy, Mr. Biden actually won a lower share of the working-class vote, both white and nonwhite, than did former President Barack Obama in 2012, according to data compiled by Catalist, a Democratic analytics firm. Meantime, House Democratic candidates underperformed Mr. Biden slightly among white working-class voters.<br />Some new political currents threaten to continue that trend. Over time, Democrats have lost some working-class voters for cultural reasons, and the woke rhetoric among party progressives may exacerbate that problem. That’s why so many Republicans are using the spread of critical race theory—which advances the argument that America remains in the grip of systemic racism—as a cudgel against Democrats.</td>

The Miami-Dade Police Department released the names late Sunday of four more previously recovered residents who died in the collapse: Leon Oliwkowicz, 80 years old; Luis Bermudez, 26; Anna Ortiz, 46; and Christina Beatriz Elvira, 74.<br />Investigators pressed ahead Monday with efforts to identify the cause of the failure. Emails released by the town Sunday included correspondence from the condo board and town officials in recent years that show residents were concerned about the effects of nearby construction.<br />On Monday morning, streets were blocked and a section of beach was barricaded both north and south of the collapsed tower. The family reunification center was quiet, with a half dozen people milling about. The Federal Emergency Management Agency was opening a recovery center in Surfside to help victims access government benefits, which typically include housing, Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted.<br />Officials said six to eight squads of rescue workers were combing through the debris pile at any given time, with hundreds of additional crew members standing by to rotate in. They employed rescue dogs, cameras and sonar to try to find pockets of space and potential survivors.</td>

      <td>SEOUL—Kim Jong Un has shed some weight. Much of North Korea is now in tears.<br />Photographed recently at Workers’ Party meetings, Mr. Kim looks slimmer, prompting the regime’s carefully choreographed state media to run interviews with ordinary North Korean citizens. They voiced concerns about the country’s leader held across the impoverished nation.<br />“We were most heartbroken when we saw our dear General Secretary had become emaciated,” said a middle-aged North Korea man, wearing a straw hat and referring to one of Mr. Kim’s official titles. “Tears came out naturally.”<br />No topic inside highly censored North Korea is more verboten than the health of the ruling Kim leader. South Korean officials have recently said they noticed no significant change to Mr. Kim’s health. Those remarks followed a November spy-agency assessment that the dictator, despite chronic smoking and obesity, appeared to be fine.<br />But Pyongyang watchers sense Mr. Kim’s skimpier figure has potential political undertones, providing stark imagery that the Supreme Leader is suffering alongside his citizens who face food shortages and an economic crisis. Mr. Kim recently acknowledged North Korea’s food situation, and he urged the country’s leaders to resolve shortages resulting from lower agricultural output, which he attributed largely to crop failures caused by last summer’s typhoons.</td>

      <td>The British raincoat brand’s boss Marco Gobbetti is leaving to join Salvatore Ferragamo</td>
      <td>Monday brought disappointment for designer label  Burberry ,  and for deal makers in the world of European luxury goods. A top-level poaching incident may strike two of the most commonly cited listed takeover targets off the industry shopping list for a while.<br />Burberry said Chief Executive Marco Gobbetti will leave in December to join Italian shoemaker  Salvatore Ferragamo .  He has been in the job less than five years and is stepping down while the British brand’s turnaround is still only half complete. During Mr. Gobbetti’s tenure, Burberry’s shares have returned 9% annually, lagging bigger brands such as Hermès and Prada.<br />Burberry’s board, which only heard about Mr. Gobbetti’s plans over the weekend, must now hunt for a new boss as well as reassure investors that lead designer Riccardo Tisci won’t follow him out the door. The company’s shares fell 8% in morning trading in London.<br />Both Salvatore Ferragamo and Burberry have long been considered takeover targets, although the former is family-controlled. Some shareholders are betting that the pandemic will compel weaker brands to sell up to one of the large, cash-rich European luxury houses, such as Gucci-owner Kering. The hiring of one of the top CEOs in the business suggests that the Ferragamo family is serious about turning the brand around by themselves. The company’s shares fell 2% despite the positive hire.<br />The timing is bad for Burberry, which is most famous for its checked trench coats. Several years into a makeover, the brand was beginning to show signs of improvement. Sales fell 10% over the pandemic-struck 12 months through March, but the label has been selling more items at full price—a sign that its image is improving among shoppers. Now, investors must wait for a new boss to be found and see whether he or she changes direction.</td>

She took a fall on the balance beam. Biles pressed on and completed her floor routine with her usual high-powered tumbling, though less-than-polished landings, to easily clinch her spot at the top of the scoreboard and the U.S. Olympic roster.</td>

Importers have three months from the time a shipment is detained to prove the products are clean, under rules that trade lawyers and business groups said require a high burden of proof. Otherwise, the cargoes must be exported or abandoned.<br />“I have heard anecdotally that some shipments have been released but most have been either denied or have not been decided,” said Richard Mojica, a trade lawyer with Miller & Chevalier in Washington, D.C.<br />Trade lawyers and business groups expect more import bans and disputed shipments to come as Washington puts more emphasis on human rights in its intensifying rivalry with Beijing and CBP steps up enforcement.</td>

      <td>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may have been waylaid on their journey back to private hands. But the way things are moving, some big players in the mortgage business could end up in a better place.<br />The Supreme Court ruling last week that the government’s sweep of the housing giants’ profit didn’t exceed their regulator’s statutory authority and that presidents can readily replace the head regulator was a one-two blow to Fannie and Freddie’s shares, which are down more than 40% in the past week. It means the Biden administration can now appoint a new chief overseer rather than keep the holdover from the Trump administration, who was seeking to release the companies from government conservatorship during his term.<br />But many stocks in the broader mortgage sector actually traded higher. For them, Fannie and Freddie’s overhaul path under the prior administration wasn’t necessarily all that great for their economics.<br />Preparing the government-sponsored enterprises to attract private investor capital involved steps like raising their capital requirements, yet still needing to boost their returns. To many in the sector, that was a recipe for higher fees and tighter access to guarantees. In one illustrative moment last year, news of a pandemic-related fee bump sent mortgage originators’ shares down sharply.<br />Under President Biden, the GSEs’ regulator may try to roll back some of those measures, or put in place other initiatives with the primary aim of making mortgages cheaper and more widely available. If GSEs were to cut fees, or expand the types of borrowers or loans they back, that could increase the market size for the firms that originate many so-called qualified mortgages—the type that the GSEs buy—such as  Rocket  Cos.,  UWM Holdings  or  loanDepot .</td>

Those purchases, along with the Fed’s monthly purchases of $80 billion of Treasury debt, aim to hold down long-term borrowing costs to stimulate the economy as it recovers from the effects of the pandemic.<br />Fed officials at their June 15-16 policy meeting reaffirmed plans to continue holding short-term interest rates near zero and continue the asset purchases for some time. They also began discussing when and how to begin reducing, or tapering, asset purchases as an initial step toward weaning the economy off such support.<br />One option suggested at the meeting was to start scaling back the mortgage-bond purchases earlier or more quickly than the Treasury debt purchases, officials said. Call it a two-speed taper.<br />“There are some unintended consequences and side effects of these purchases that we are seeing play out,” Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said in an interview, referring to the mortgage-bond purchases, which he thinks are contributing to skyrocketing home prices. He had said previously that he was questioning whether the purchases are still needed. “I’ve shared my views” at the policy meeting, he said.</td>

The bug was spreading rapidly through his Tokyo daycare, said his mother, Miwako Tsukidate, 27, and the boy was hospitalized for oxygen treatment for a week.<br />By the time Toranosuke was discharged, his mother observed the beds around him filling up with children suffering the same ailment, which is usually more common in the fall. “I was surprised to see how it took off so quickly, and I was also surprised to see it spreading at this time of the year,” Ms. Tsukidate said.<br />At Perth Children’s Hospital in Australia, infectious diseases researcher David Foley isn’t surprised. His country experienced a similar out-of-season flare-up of the virus that infected Toranosuke—respiratory syncytial virus or RS virus—during the Southern Hemisphere’s summer months following an unusually quiet winter.</td>

Case in point: its relationship with VGI Partners, a global equity asset management firm based in Australia. VGI owns around 1% of the company, making up around 4.5% and 6% of its global and Asia-focused listed funds, respectively.<br />It is easy to see Yakult’s promise.

If those nominations succeed, the board will go from having two non-Japanese members—the legacy of a relationship with  Danone  that ended last year—to having none.

Rob Portman (R., Ohio), on ABC’s “This Week.” He added: “We were glad to see them disconnected.”<br />Said Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) on CNN’s “State of the Union”: “I do trust the president.”<br />The negotiations at the start of a summerlong legislative blitz represent the biggest test yet of Mr. Biden’s ability to achieve a bipartisan victory in the first year of his presidency. The former vice president has pointed to his three decades in the Senate as proof of his deal-making abilities at a time of deep partisan polarization, increasing the stakes for Mr. Biden, should the deal collapse.</td>

      <td>Its lawsuit against Georgia is weak on evidence and the law.</td>
      <td>President Biden has called Georgia’s new voting law a revival of Jim Crow. So it was probably inevitable that the Justice Department would file suit, as it did Friday, alleging that the state Legislature “intended to deny or abridge the right of Black Georgians to vote.”<br />The federal complaint is as transparently political as its argument is unconvincing. When Covid hit in the run-up to Georgia’s 2020 primary, state officials decided to send every active voter an unsolicited application for a mail ballot. The new law bans this practice. As proof of animus, the feds point to an interview by House Speaker David Ralston, who said that mass mail voting could “drive up turnout” and be “extremely devastating to Republicans.”<br />The lawsuit doesn’t mention that in the same interview Mr. Ralston cited “a multitude of reasons why vote by mail, in my view, is not acceptable.” One, security: “You send a ballot application into a home on a mass scale, as has been proposed to do, and you don’t know who’s going to vote the ballot.” Two, privacy, in case election officials mass-mailed ballots with “personal data” already filled out. In any case, last year’s emergency measures in a 100-year pandemic are not a reasonable baseline today.<br />The lawsuit’s argument on ballot drop boxes has the same problem. In 2019 they were illegal in Georgia. When the pandemic hit, the state temporarily approved them, and there were 38 in Fulton County, which contains most of Atlanta. If the Legislature had done nothing, the lapsing of the emergency authorization would have outlawed drop boxes again. Instead lawmakers made them permanent, albeit under tighter rules that let Fulton County set up only eight. Essentially, the feds are arguing that any retreat from Covid rules is racist.<br />Georgia’s new law no longer requires election workers to squint at voters’ signatures. Rather, someone applying for a mail ballot will supply a state-ID number or a copy of another identifying document, such as a utility bill. The feds say this is a burden on black voters.</td>

      <td>The bipartisan Senate deal finances Biden priorities with savings from unused jobless benefits.</td>
      <td>The more we examine the bipartisan Senate infrastructure deal, the worse its details look. Consider its plan to pay for new spending in part with unemployment-benefit savings from GOP states that are recovering faster economically and ending the $300 federal bonus.<br />The outline of the deal includes an estimated $25 billion in revenue from unused jobless benefits. In March Democrats extended the $300 bonus into September and expanded enhanced benefits by 53 weeks, plus an additional 13 to 20 weeks in states with persistent high unemployment. Workers in states like California (7.9% in May) and New York (7.8%) can qualify for 99 weeks of benefits.<br />But the faster economic recovery and early benefit terminations by some states are resulting in lower unemployment spending than the Congressional Budget Office forecasted in March. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, federal spending on unemployment benefits will likely be about $56 billion lower than CBO predicted.<br />Guess where most of those “savings” will come from? Answer: the 26, mostly GOP-led, states that have announced plans to end the bonus before its planned expiration after Labor Day. Florida, Texas, Georgia, Utah and Oklahoma stopped theirs on Saturday.<br />The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget notes that those 26 states have received a little over a quarter of the payments made under the March spending bill. That’s because they have smaller populations and much lower unemployment. The average unemployment rate in the 26 states was 1.4 percentage points lower in April than the national average.</td>

      <td>Joe Biden told the truth about Democratic strategy the first time.</td>
      <td>You have to hand it to Steven Ricchetti. The White House counselor to President Biden, and chief architect of the bipartisan infrastructure deal, has scrambled to clean up the political mess left by his boss last Thursday. His handiwork doesn’t change Democratic intentions, but the media and some Senators have already bought the spin.<br />President, er, Counselor Ricchetti, orchestrated a statement from Mr. Biden on Saturday that appeared to take back the blunder on Thursday when Mr. Biden threatened to veto the infrastructure deal he had endorsed a mere two hours earlier. That veto threat had caused a stir because Mr. Biden was insisting that a multi-trillion-dollar spending bill pass “in tandem” with the $1.2 trillion bipartisan bill. GOP negotiators were publicly humiliated—and privately furious.<br />At first the White House claimed this was no big deal, that everyone knew Mr. Biden wants both bills, and no one should have been surprised, as press secretary Jen Psaki explained on Friday. But that made the GOP negotiators and Democrats like Joe Manchin look as if they’d been taken for a ride.<br />Enter Mr. Ricchetti with his fire hose. “At a press conference after announcing the bipartisan agreement, I indicated that I would refuse to sign the infrastructure bill if it was sent to me without my Families Plan and other priorities, including clean energy,” Mr. Biden said Saturday in a statement released by the White House. “That statement understandably upset some Republicans, who do not see the two plans as linked; they are hoping to defeat my Families Plan—and do not want their support for the infrastructure plan to be seen as aiding passage of the Families Plan. My comments also created the impression that I was issuing a veto threat on the very plan I had just agreed to, which was certainly not my intent.”<br />Note that phrase “to be seen as aiding” the Families Plan. Mr. Biden’s statement Saturday changes nothing except the Ricchetti atmospherics. Mr. Biden spoke the real truth on Thursday. He knows, because Mr. Ricchetti tells him, that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer plan to jam through as much of the Families Plan as they can on a partisan vote.</td>

      <td>In Plessy v. Ferguson and other landmark cases, Harlan stood fast and, often, alone. When the law ﬁnally moved in his direction, he stood vindicated.</td>
      <td>If Justice John Marshall Harlan had written only one opinion, his legacy would still be secure. His solo dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), denouncing “separate but equal” racial segregation, is the greatest judicial dissent in American history.<br />But Harlan’s 30-plus years on the court were marked by other great opinions. As America retreated from Reconstruction and as the court resisted the Progressive Era, Harlan stood fast and, often, alone. Years later, when the law moved in Harlan’s direction, he stood vindicated.<br />In our own time, America finds itself grappling with the same questions that Harlan did: race, monopoly, the rule of law, and judges’ role in our constitutional republic. This is an ideal moment to study his opinions—and the principles that undergirded them. Peter S. Canellos offers both in “The Great Dissenter: The Story of John Marshall Harlan, America’s Judicial Hero.”<br />Harlan was born in 1833 to a prominent, slave-holding Kentucky family. His father named him after the great Chief Justice John Marshall, and raised him to revere Kentucky’s own great man, Henry Clay. He studied law and followed politics but, like so many of Clay’s acolytes, was left politically homeless in the 1850s after the Whig Party’s demise.<br />He won acclaim in 1855 with a statewide speaking tour. But his message of moderation, compromise and union, Mr. Canellos tells us, left him “preaching the virtues of a system that was collapsing under the weight of its own contradictions.” Two years later, Chief Justice Roger Taney and six other Supreme Court justices declared in the Dred Scott case that black people were not American citizens and that Congress had no power to prohibit slavery, and thus no power to enact the Missouri Compromise or other Union-preserving legislation. In 1859, while running for Congress in Kentucky, Harlan urged his countrymen to accept the Dred Scott decision, saying that it had settled the slavery question. But when Abraham Lincoln’s election spurred Southern secession, Harlan fought for the Union and nearly saw action at Shiloh.</td>

      <td>I learned teamwork, pacing and, most important, the value of education.</td>
      <td>I was 16 in the summer of 1954, when I worked my first job. My father believed I should be able to make some money to help with school costs, so I was hired by the largest construction company in New Haven, Conn., C.W. Blakeslee & Sons. I spent most days in a ditch with a pick and shovel. I learned a lot.<br />Each morning I took the bus from our home in suburban Hamden to the center of New Haven, where another bus took me west on Chapel Street to the Blakeslee offices and yard, where those of us hoping to find work waited until the crew bosses got their assignments and picked the men they’d need that day. A kid with no experience was last to be called, but there was plenty of work, so I regularly heard a boss point to me and say: “I need you today.” Off I would go, riding in the rear of a dump truck painted in what was known as Blakeslee Blue, headed to a dig a ditch.<br />Usually we were digging trenches for telephone cables along a city street. After a stop for coffee—which I drank for the first time on the job that summer—we were in the ditch.<br />On one of my early days in the ditch, I was working alongside an “old” laborer with a thick Italian accent. He was probably 40. As I dug furiously, he turned to me with obvious impatience: “Hey kid, slowa down. You go too fast. Take it easy. You finisha theese ditch, there gonna be another ditch.” Major lesson learned. I must not make my co-worker look bad. I was on a team, and the team had its rules.<br />The next lesson was related but subtler. After a few weeks on the job, I began to realize the value of pacing myself. On many mornings I—young and fit and eager—would work so briskly that by noon I was tired, and the hot summer-afternoon sun was looming ahead. I soon learned to set a pace I could hold throughout the long day. How I began to long for 3 o’clock, when I knew we had only one more hour to work.</td>

      <td>The country has lost faith in experts, but a thorough review free from conflicts of interest could help.</td>
      <td>The pandemic is on its way out, but how many Americans think the U.S. approach succeeded? More than 600,000 Americans died from Covid, and lockdowns have left extensive collateral damage. Trust in science has eroded, and the damage won’t be limited to epidemiology, virology and public health. Scientists in other fields will unfortunately also have to deal with the fallout, including oncologists, physicists, computer scientists, environmental engineers and even economists.<br />The first step to restoring the public’s trust in scientific experts is an honest and comprehensive evaluation of the nation’s pandemic response. Sens. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) and Susan Collins (R., Maine) have introduced a bill that would establish a Covid commission to examine the origins of the virus, the early response to the epidemic, and equity issues in the disease’s impact. Private foundations are also in the process of planning such a commission.<br />For a commission to be credible, it needs to be broad in both scope and membership. Members can’t have conflicts of interest. If the public perceives the commission is a whitewash, distrust in the scientific community will erode further. A commission must consider four major areas of the U.S. pandemic strategy:<br />• Public-health measures, including the closing of schools, businesses, sports, religious services and cultural events; other forms of physical distancing; protection of nursing homes; masks; testing; contact tracing; case counts; cause-of-death audits; decreased medical care; Cares Act payments to hospitals, and much more.<br />• The treatment of Covid patients, including prophylactics, therapeutics, ventilators, hospital care and crowding; ethnic and income disparities; an evaluation of federal agencies responsible for funding research on treatments.</td>

      <td>Too many bad laws are already on the books, and procedural roadblocks make them hard to repeal.</td>
      <td>Senate Democrats’ effort to abolish the legislative filibuster appears doomed to fail in this term, now that Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have made clear their strong opposition. That’s a shame. Conservatives benefit from the filibuster when the Democrats hold the majority, but they should support its repeal. It makes it harder to get laws enacted, but it also makes them harder to repeal. With all the noxious laws on the books, Republicans should be the party of repeal.<br />Getting legislation passed or repealed in America is like waiting for three cherries to line up in a slot machine. Absent veto-proof congressional supermajorities, one needs the concurrence of the House, Senate and president. The possibility of deadlock is magnified by the filibuster, which since 1975 has permitted 41 senators to block a vote on most legislation. Since 1979, no party has controlled all three branches and enjoyed a filibuster-proof Senate majority, save for a nine-month period in 2009-10.<br />That’s not a bad thing if the heightened barriers mean that good bills will survive and bad bills won’t. That was Hamilton’s argument for the separation of powers in Federalist 73. But measures that prevent bad laws from being enacted also impede their repeal. So the choice is between screening before a law is enacted in a presidential regime and the reversibility that is possible in a parliamentary one, in which a majority government can do what it likes, so that a single cherry from the one-armed bandit is enough.<br />Conservatives tend to think screening is more important. If fewer laws are passed, that’s fine with them. Progressives lament the brake that the separation of powers places on new legislation. They look back fondly to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s first hundred days in 1933, when the executive drafted bills, which Congress rubber-stamped without debate.<br />Now, however, conservatives ought to value reversibility. Imagine a new Congress and a new president elected in 2024 to reverse decades of wasteful interest-group bargains. As Mitch McConnell said in 2013, when the Democrats did away with the filibuster for nominations: “Just you wait!”</td>

      <td>It’d be better if more politicians disagreed with deficit spending.</td>
      <td>Political types often complain there isn’t enough compromise and cooperation in Washington. Fiscal conservatives—to the extent we still exist—think there’s too much. I’d argue that the only thing that’s truly bipartisan these days is spending money. Exhibit A is the bipartisan infrastructure bill that received President Biden’s blessing on Thursday.<br />For a while it was unclear if a deal could be struck. Lawmakers have primarily been scrapping over the so-called pay-fors, Beltway-speak for the measures that might, at least on paper, raise the money for new spending. This is a regular hurdle to agreements in Washington, but not because of any sense of fiscal responsibility. Democrats only want to raise taxes on whoever they currently deem “the rich”; Republicans don’t like raising taxes on anybody. And neither party has any appetite for reducing spending even to offset increases elsewhere.<br />But the dirty secret is that politicians really don’t have to pay for new spending. Indeed, they rarely do—and even when they make a token effort, it usually involves accounting tricks such as “pension smoothing” and “changes in mandatory programs.” (If you don’t have any clue what either of those things mean, don’t worry. Most members of Congress don’t either.)<br />Those of us familiar with the spending process saw a sign last week that an infrastructure deal was probably coming: Republicans suggested that they wouldn’t allow the pay-fors to prevent a deal. Instead, the discussions shifted to forming agreements on how not to pay for the bill: Democrats agreed to GOP demands not to raise the corporate tax, while Republicans abandoned proposals on gasoline-tax increases and fees on electric vehicles.<br />With that, the fix was in. Once negotiations in Washington turn exclusively on deficit spending, deals become much easier to accomplish. Plus, with 1,000 billion dollars to spread, there was plenty of money to satisfy everyone. No wonder that one high-profile lobbyist called the infrastructure deal “Christmas.”</td>

      <td>‘F9: The Fast Saga’ and other recent releases show moviegoers’ steadily growing appetite to return to theaters</td>
      <td>LOS ANGELES—The “Fast & Furious” franchise gave Hollywood its best opening weekend since December 2019 at the box office this weekend, offering further evidence that American entertainment industries are accelerating toward some semblance of normalcy.<br />“F9: The Fast Saga,” the ninth installment of the car-racing franchise, collected an estimated $70 million from domestic theaters. While that opening is only the sixth-best of the series so far, it comes after several releases that indicate a steadily growing appetite among moviegoers to venture back to the theater.<br />“This film establishes that we’re coming out of it,” said Jim Orr, president of domestic theatrical distribution at  Comcast Corp.’s  Universal Pictures, which distributed the film.<br />The opening of “F9” is the best of any Hollywood release since “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” in late 2019, and follows the encouraging openings of “Godzilla vs. Kong” in March and “A Quiet Place Part II” in May.<br />“F9,” however, offers the clearest test yet on the post-pandemic habits of moviegoers. The movie is the most-anticipated title released since the pandemic closed theaters and comes as about 80% of the auditoriums have reopened and major cities allow full-capacity seating inside them.</td>

      <td>SINGAPORE—At least 10 of the 26 doctors in Indonesia who died from Covid-19 this month had received both doses of the vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech Ltd., a medical association said, raising questions about the Chinese-made shot that is being used in many parts of the developing world.<br />The Indonesian Medical Association’s Covid-19 mitigation group is still working to verify the vaccination status of the 16 others, said Dr. Adib Khumaidi, who leads the group. According to the group’s latest figures, over a five-month period, at least 20 doctors who were fully inoculated with Sinovac’s vaccine died from Covid-19, accounting for more than a fifth of total fatalities among doctors during that time span.<br />The toll could rise further in the coming weeks as the country battles a surge in infections and hospitals across the archipelago fill up.<br />Epidemiologists say the deaths need to be properly investigated to determine whether factors such as poor hospital care or chronic underlying illnesses played a major role. They also say more data is needed, including on how many vaccinated doctors overall were infected with Covid-19, which Indonesia’s health ministry says it isn’t tracking.<br />Around 90% of Indonesian doctors—roughly 160,000 in all—have been vaccinated with Sinovac’s shot, according to the medical association, so the vaccinated doctors who died are only a tiny percentage of the total.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—More parts of Australia have been locked down as authorities try to locate workers from a remote gold mine linked to five Covid-19 cases thought to be of the highly infectious Delta strain.<br />The far north city of Darwin and two nearby areas were locked down on Sunday for 48 hours after officials failed to locate 15 of 211 workers who flew into Darwin from the Granites Mine in central Australia. The Northern Territory, which covers 548,000 square miles of mostly desert, reported four new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, all linked to a worker previously identified as positive.<br />“The safest thing to do is to assume the worst, assume they are positive and assume there are exposure sites,” Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner said.<br />Mr. Gunner said all cases at the mine, which is about 330 miles north of iconic Uluru, were highly likely to be of the Delta variant. He said the outbreak represented the biggest threat to his region since the pandemic began.<br />The first Covid-19 case from the mine was diagnosed on Saturday. About 750 workers are in isolation on site, while about 900 workers have dispersed across the territory and into neighboring Queensland and Western Australia states.</td>

      <td>Advocates and media circle the wagons and try to conceal the truth about a pernicious ideology.</td>
      <td>Critical race theory is the latest battleground in the culture war. Since the murder of George Floyd last year, critical race theory’s key concepts, including “systemic racism,” “white privilege,” and “white fragility,” have become ubiquitous in America’s elite institutions. Progressive politicians have sought to implement “antiracist” policies to reduce racial disparities, such as minorities-only income programs and racially segregated vaccine distribution.<br />The ideology has sparked an immense backlash. As Americans have sought to understand critical race theory, they have discovered that it has divided Americans into racial categories of “oppressor” and “oppressed” and promotes radical concepts such as “spirit murder” (what public schools supposedly do to black children) and “abolishing whiteness” (a purported precondition for social justice). In the classroom, critical race theory-inspired lessons have often devolved into race-based struggle sessions, with public schools forcing children to rank themselves according to a racial hierarchy, subjecting white teachers to “antiracist therapy,” and encouraging parents to become “white traitors.”<br />Alarmed state legislators have pushed back. In recent months, lawmakers in 24 states have introduced, and six have enacted, legislation banning public schools from promoting critical race theory’s core concepts, including race essentialism, collective guilt and racial superiority. Parent groups around the country have mobilized to oppose critical race theory in the classroom, arguing that it cultivates shame in white students and fatalism in minority students. According to a recent YouGov survey, of the 64% of Americans who have heard about critical race theory, 58% view it unfavorably, including 72% of political independents.<br />That’s a major liability for the political left. Sensing that they are losing control of the narrative on race, left-leaning media outlets have launched a furious counterattack. Liberal pundits at the  New York Times ,  Washington Post, MSNBC and elsewhere have begun spinning a new mythology that presents critical race theory as a benign academic concept, casts its detractors as right-wing extremists driven by racial resentment, and portrays legislation against critical race theory as an attempt to ban teaching about the history of slavery and racism. All three charges are false.<br />First, critical race theory isn’t an exercise in promoting racial sensitivity or understanding history. It’s a radical ideology that seeks to use race as a means of moral, social and political revolution. The left-leaning media has sought to portray it as a “lens” for examining the history of racism in the U.S., but this soft framing obscures the nature of the theory, which maintains that America is an irredeemably racist nation and that the constitutional principles of freedom and equality are mere “camouflages,” in the words of scholar William F. Tate IV, for white supremacy. The solution, according to prominent exponents of critical race theory such as Ibram X. Kendi, is to abolish capitalism and install a near-omnipotent federal bureaucracy with the power to nullify any law and silence political speech that isn’t “antiracist.”</td>

      <td>Remember the cringeworthy “Drill, baby, drill” slogan from the 2008 Republican Convention? Maybe they were on to something, but not what you think. We’re bombarded daily with calls for sustainable, renewable and carbon chewable technologies to meet our energy needs. But the solution may be just underfoot.<br />Dig deep enough and, no surprise, it’s hotter than hell down there. Isotope reactions in the mantle under the Earth’s crust generate 20 terawatts of constant heat flow. Typically, the temperature rises about 25 degrees Celsius for every kilometer, or 75 degrees Fahrenheit for each mile, and more the deeper you go. The steam wafting out of hot springs in Yellowstone National Park or Iceland, places where the Earth’s crust is thin, shows how much heat the mantle gives off.<br />We already have a good-sized surface geothermal industry in the U.S. For $15,000 to $30,000, you can hire someone to dig a few hundred feet and install a heat pump that circulates heated water to keep your house cozy.<br />But that’s just scratching the surface. There is huge upside to digging down miles and injecting water into underground reservoirs—think radiators—and then the heated water is pushed back out to generate steam and electricity. It’s carbon-free—clean, green and mostly unseen.<br />The trick is to get a large enough surface area to do the heat exchange. A typical vertical oil well might have 1,000 to 10,000 square feet of surface area. But it turns out that the same thing that’s been perfected over the past 30 years to make America energy independent can also increase that surface area—horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.</td>

Many took it a step further and said the event signified the true return of New York City, which has come alive in recent weeks with the easing of pandemic restrictions.<br />“Everything is busier and busier.

After graduation, he returned full-time to manage his alma mater’s network and website, eventually becoming its director of technology and information systems in 2014.<br />Then came the Covid-19 lockdowns and “a lot of time to reflect,” Mr. Bonner says. “It really prompted me to ask, ‘What am I doing?’ ”<br />His first inkling that he wanted a change came last summer, when the school called administrative staff back to campus after going remote in the spring. Mr. Bonner, who had overseen La Salle’s move to online operations, realized he preferred remote work and the security of knowing he was safe at home with his wife and toddler. “No one knew what was going on then,” he recalls.<br />Getting a taste of digital work life and virtual collaboration transformed how Mr. Bonner thought about his career. “That was a light-bulb moment of, ‘Oh, this is how some industries are. They’ve moved into the 21st century,’ ” he says. “In education, everyone was really excited to get back to normal, and I wanted to find a company that was like ‘No, this is the future, this is the way we want it to be.’ ”</td>

      <td>U.S. Catholic bishops would appear to be committing three sins, one religious and two political (“Bishops Advance Restriction on Communion,” U.S. News, June 19). The religious sin is the unwitting embrace of 17th-18th century Jansenism, condemned as heresy by Pope Clement XI’s 1713 papal bull “Unigenitus Dei Filius.” Chief among the 101 heretical errors so condemned was the belief that those receiving Communion must be morally pure. As Pope Francis has stated, “The Eucharist is not the reward of saints, but the bread of sinners.” Jansenism also was bound up with efforts to restrict papal authority more broadly, which might be counted as more of a political rather than a religious sin.<br />The more egregious political sin the bishops’ effort recalls, however, is the unintended affirmation of the charge leveled against John F. Kennedy by Protestant ministers, namely that the Roman Catholic Church would control Kennedy’s actions as president, though they had in mind the pope, not the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). Still, by weaponizing the Eucharist against Catholic politicians, with whose political views they disagree, are they not confirming an old anti-Catholic prejudice, which ought to have been dispensed with long ago?<br />Em.

      <td>Ad-tech player has built a formidable business that’s still seen as vulnerable to big tech’s whims</td>
      <td>The  Trade Desk  lives, but it can’t escape the cookie monster’s shadow.<br />When Google announced plans Thursday to delay its phaseout of third-party tracking cookies, Trade Desk’s stock jumped 16%, leading a strong uptick among other so-called ad-tech players. It was a nice bump that didn’t quite bring the stock back up to its level from before Google announced its original plan in early March. That news—with a plan to phase out cookies by early next year—cost Trade Desk about 20% of its market value over a two-day period.<br />While the recent change is good news for the company, the market’s stark reaction reflects the continued belief that Trade Desk is highly vulnerable to the whims of its massive rival. The ad-tech company, which helps other companies buy ads across the internet, has built a formidable business in its own right, with close to $900 million in trailing 12-month revenue and still growing at a strong double-digit rate. The vast majority of that business takes place on platforms such as connected televisions that lie outside of the search ecosystem that Google dominates. But the digital advertising business is a very big pond; eMarketer estimates the global market grew nearly 13% to reach about $378 billion in 2020. And Google is by far the biggest fish in that pond, with advertising revenue reported by parent company  Alphabet Inc.  now just under $158 billion a year.<br />That lopsided relationship means the search giant’s actions cause major ripples. Cookies—bits of code that follow users around the internet—have historically been a major tool for online advertisers to target their spending. But their poor image with privacy advocates also has made them unfashionable.  Apple Inc.  began blocking cookies with its Safari web browser in 2017, and Google has long teased that it will do the same with its Chrome browser. Those two together account for about 83% of the world’s browser market share, according to Statcounter.<br />Trade Desk has thus been working to build up an alternative solution. The company’s effort—an open-sourced initiative called Unified ID 2.0—uses email and artificial intelligence to help advertisers with their targeting. Analysts at ISI Evercore set a buy rating on Trade Desk in April—after Google announced its original cookie phaseout plan—citing the company’s strong position relative to peers “because brands trust them with their first-party data.” The Unified ID 2.0 program also has drawn the support of major advertisers such as Walmart, which sits on “one of the most robust sets of consumer retail data in the world,” ISI noted.</td>

That was a decade ago. Federer didn’t even consider it. The chase for major titles was just too special to give up, especially with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic hot on his heels.</td>

After meeting with senior administration officials on Thursday, the tax committee chairmen in Congress said lawmakers would make those decisions over the next several weeks.<br />“We’re going to build the plan, figure out what people want, what they’re willing to pay for, but also not to be deterred,” House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D., Mass.), said in an interview Friday. “There’s this moment, when we’re talking about Great Society achievements and we’re talking about New Deal achievements. This is it.”<br />Democrats raised taxes each of the last two times they controlled the government—in 1993 and 2010—after bruising political battles that drew objections from moderates inside the party.<br />Now, some Democrats are convinced that tax politics have changed and public concern about inequality and corporate tax avoidance make the issue less toxic. The goal: approach 1990s levels of taxes, as a share of the economy, without reversing middle-class tax cuts enacted since then or raising taxes directly on households making under $400,000, a level that covers all but 2% of Americans.</td>

      <td>ESG investing has come a long way in the past few years.<br />Once a niche investment sector, strategies that screen companies and other assets based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria are attracting more money than ever.<br />There are various definitions of—and approaches to—so-called sustainable investing. Some strategies seek to avoid investments in industries deemed harmful to society such as tobacco, while others aim to further environmental or social causes like climate change or workplace diversity. Regardless of the approach, interest in the category as a whole is growing dramatically.<br />At the end of 2019, about $17.1 trillion—roughly one-third of all assets under professional management in the U.S.—was being managed using some type of sustainable-investment strategy or by institutions that filed shareholder resolutions on ESG issues, according to the most recent data from the US SIF Foundation, a sustainable-investing trade group. That was a 42% increase from two years earlier, the group said.<br />In the first quarter of this year, meanwhile, a net $21.5 billion flowed into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that use ESG screens or some other type of sustainable-investing approach, a record amount and almost double the net inflows in the year-earlier quarter, according to a report from Morningstar Inc.</td>

      <td>According to statisticians, the official death count of 390,000 falls far short of the pandemic’s actual toll</td>
      <td>NEW DELHI—As coronavirus cases rose rapidly across India in April, a 70-year-old woman died at her home in the eastern state of Bihar. A rapid antigen test for Covid-19 had been positive, and a lung scan had indicated viral pneumonia and the “possibility of Covid infection.”<br />But Shila Singh’s death hasn’t been counted among India’s Covid-19 toll.<br />India has officially recorded more than 390,000 coronavirus deaths, but families who have lost loved ones, health experts and statisticians say that vastly undercounts the true toll. Families like Mrs. Singh’s have been left struggling to get compensation that some states have set up for Covid-19 victims.<br />India’s undercount has also left a huge gap in the world’s understanding of the impact of the Delta variant, which health experts believe helped drive one of the world’s worst Covid-19 surges in April and May. India was the first to detect the highly infectious variant, which has hopscotched around the world. It is fueling a surge in the U.K., and is expected to become the dominant variant in the U.S.<br />An accurate count of Covid-19 infections and deaths is “a very important part of understanding how big a threat new variants are,” said Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.</td>

      <td>When workplaces are only available part-time, it can get tricky deciding who gets to come in when</td>
      <td>When Kristi Fox, chief HR officer of a financial-services firm in St. Paul, Minn., helped prepare the office for in-person work in May, she and her colleagues came up with the idea to offer free breakfast and lunch in their cafeteria on Mondays and Fridays to encourage attendance. So far, it’s working—but only on Mondays. “Not a chance for Fridays. No one wants to come into the office then, if they can help it,” she says.<br />Their office allows their staff of about 3,000 to come in any day or days of the week they want, without reservations, and about 17% have opted in so far. The most popular days are Mondays and Wednesdays, which Ms. Fox believes allows workers to transition more smoothly into the weekend.<br />Divvying up days and teams in the post-pandemic hybrid workplace can be complicated. For one thing, few people want to come in on a Friday. Both experts and those who have prototyped their own companies’ return-to-work plans say that, perhaps counterintuitively, structure can be your best friend: Mandating schedules is usually better than endless choices, and a clear, unified message to all employees is essential.<br />A McKinsey survey of 5,043 full-time employees around the world between December and January found that people had diverse work-from-home preferences. Nearly equal portions of those surveyed said they’d prefer zero days of remote work per week (17%), three days (22%) or five days (19%). This suggests many workers are flexible—but that can be an issue in itself.<br />“What makes hybrid work kind of interesting is that it’s the only kind of work we don’t know how to do,” says Ethan Bernstein, associate professor of management at Harvard Business School. “People mastered working from home. In-person is the way things were. But there are so many ways to get hybrid wrong.”</td>

      <td>Vote provides early window into how voters are responding to the violence ahead of next year’s presidential election</td>
      <td>PARIS—Millions of French voters headed to the polls on Sunday for regional elections in a country grappling with recent terrorist attacks and tensions over the place of Islam in society.<br />Conservative candidates campaigning on anti-immigration and law-and-order pledges jumped out to a significant lead in the first round of voting a week ago, piling pressure on the centrist party of President Emmanuel Macron, who faces re-election next year.<br />Conservatives garnered an estimated 29.3% of the vote nationally last Sunday amid record-high abstention rates, while Marine Le Pen’s antimigrant National Rally took a lower-than-expected 19.1%. The Socialist Party and the Green Party won 16.5% and 13.2% respectively, while Mr. Macron’s party came in fifth with 10.9%.<br />On Sunday, turnout by midday was 12.66%, slightly up from last week’s record low of 12.22%, according to the French Interior Ministry. Turnout stood at 19.59% at the same time in the previous regional elections in 2015.<br />France has been buffeted by a string of terrorist attacks in recent years, including the beheading of a middle-school teacher by a Chechen refugee in October. That attack stunned the nation, with Mr. Macron describing it as an assault on France’s Enlightenment values and cracking down on mosques across the country.</td>

      <td>Mark Cavendish is closing in on Eddy Merckx’s 34 Tour de France stage wins and back in the race this year. And if Cavendish doesn’t catch him, no one ever will.</td>
      <td>No one was more shocked by Mark Cavendish’s return to the Tour de France than Mark Cavendish. The pre-eminent sprinter of his generation, now 36 years old, was firmly in the twilight of his career, thinking serious thoughts about retirement, when the call came on Monday.<br />But by adding him to the Tour roster, his Deceuninck-Quickstep team did more than give a veteran one more shot in the world’s most famous bike race. It also put the spotlight back onto one of the last untouchable records in sports.<br />Cavendish has won 30 Tour de France stages over his glittering career, just four short of the all-time mark. The reality is that he’s unlikely to match it at his age. And if Cavendish can’t do it, then it probably means that no one ever will. The 34 Tour de France stage victories, by cycling GOAT Eddy Merckx, can live on in a class with Joe DiMaggio’s 56-game hitting streak and Steffi Graf’s seven-plus years at world no. 1.<br />“I won 34 in my career and I never thought that the record would last, that I’d be the person with the most stage wins,” Merckx said in a phone interview from Belgium.<br />The reason Merckx won’t be caught any time soon is that he was the consummate all-rounder and pro cycling has become a sport of highly targeted specialists. Skinny climbers win in the mountains. Sprinters win flat stages. And masochists win time-trials. Claiming the yellow jersey at the end of three weeks isn’t so much about racking up stage victories as it is an exercise in relentless consistency, stealing a few seconds here and there from your closest rivals.</td>

      <td>Lumber, copper, other raw materials fall from recent highs, but investors still see reasons to buy</td>
      <td>Many commodities from copper to lumber have dropped from their peak pandemic prices, easing the most acute worries about an inflationary spiral. But investors remain bullish on many of them, arguing they still look cheap.<br />Copper is down 10% from a record it hit in March. Front-month futures for corn and soybeans are off their May highs by 13% and 19%, respectively. Hogs have lost 17% this month.<br />Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently said lumber’s dramatic arc showed how the sky-high materials costs that characterized the reopening economy were the result of supply bottlenecks and other factors that aren’t expected to last as the world’s economies move further from lockdown. Lumber futures have fallen 54% after shooting up to more than four times the average price during the most recent springs before the pandemic.<br />“A few months ago the consensus was that prices for commodities can’t go anywhere but up,” said Richard Dunbar, head of multiasset research at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “More recently, though, we’ve had a few reminders that prices don’t go up in a straight line.”<br />Despite the recent drop, lumber remains twice the typical price for this time of year. Copper, row crops and swine are still around their highest prices in years. Oil and natural gas, laggards of the reopening, have risen sharply to their highest levels since 2018.</td>
