      <td>Taxing the rich won’t come close to funding the new social spending the White House is proposing.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s first full budget, released last month, forecasts a large increase in social spending, paid for both by heavy increases in taxes and by big deficits and new public debt. The budget, which outlines major new spending initiatives in the American Rescue Plan, American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan, represents nothing short of a transformation of government’s role in the economy.<br />Many economists, including Lawrence Summers, have highlighted the risks of the budget’s fiscal profligacy, namely inflation. But going deeper, the budget creates structural fiscal risks by crowding out future spending on things unrelated to the Biden administration’s social agenda. It limits government flexibility to address future pressing needs without much larger tax increases than the budget proposes. And the plan’s focus on basic income rather than work is a step in the wrong direction. These risks can be addressed—and in a progressive manner—but this budget needs to return to the starting line.<br />To begin, the Biden budget would compromise the federal government’s ability to provide public goods and social insurance, handle crises like pandemics or financial panics, and address gaps in economic opportunity—all while handing a hefty debt-service bill to future generations that will benefit very little from today’s spending blitz.<br />Recall the maxim: “When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.” The Biden administration needs to put the shovels down. Permanent new social spending should be financed by incremental tax revenue so it doesn’t add to already elevated deficit and debt levels. Borrowing would be permitted for one-time expenditures that add to productivity and future wealth (and taxpaying ability)—for example, true infrastructure such as roads and bridges.<br />But the Biden budget doesn’t follow this advice. It spends more money on social causes and makes government larger without coming up with enough new revenue to pay for it. The budget proposes to spend 24.5% of gross domestic product on average over the next 10 years. The post-World War II record before the pandemic was 24.4% in 2009, and the 50-year average is closer to 20%. Meantime, revenues are projected to rise only to 19.7% of GDP by the end of the 10-year budget period, just below the record share of 20% in 2000 during the dot-com boom. The gap reflects additional pressure on deficits and debt even as rising deficits from the Social Security and Medicare programs pose a significant challenge.</td>

      <td>With simple majority rule in the Senate, politics would consume the lives of ordinary Americans.</td>
      <td>As Democrats clamor to end the Senate filibuster, they insist that the filibuster is an ancient relic that nobody needs, that serves nobody’s agenda and that improves nobody’s life. These political somebodies are right—but not in the sense they imagine. When our Founding Fathers set up the Senate, it was precisely the needs, the agenda and the lives of millions of political nobodies that they meant to protect.<br />Through the filibuster, Americans enjoy the unique freedom not to be politically active while remaining largely safe in their lives, liberty and property. The political nobodies are liberated to focus on improving their own lives and the lives of those around them.<br />That’s not how the political somebodies see things. They think they know how everything should work and what everyone should do. If they aren’t on TV telling you what to do, they are shouting in megaphones, demanding other political somebodies do this or that for some greater cause. Politics is their passion, and they want politics to be your passion. The filibuster blocks them from imposing their agenda and using your life for policy experiments every time they have a majority in the Senate.<br />The U.S. has far more political nobodies than somebodies. Maybe the nobodies don’t vote in every election or know the names of their elected officials, but they do know what is important to them. Their passion isn’t politics, it is their families, businesses, religion, careers, sports, arts, education and other personal pursuits. They do all the good and worthy things outside the political world. Yet their freedom to live as they want would fade without the silent sentry of the Senate filibuster.<br />The Senate’s cloture rule requires a supermajority of 60 members to end debate on most topics and move to a vote. That is no accident. It is a purposeful design to require broad consensus on important new legislative proposals.</td>

      <td>‘Yesterday’s radical firebrand becomes today’s tepid centrist; today’s moderate will be tomorrow’s reactionary.’</td>
      <td>Seth Barronwriting on New York City’s Tuesday mayoral primary in a special issue of City Journal:<br /><br />In New York, the primary election is usually the real contest, though the primaries produce even lower turnout than general elections. With no reason to be concerned about alienating centrist voters or activating the other side in November by being too extreme, candidates appeal to the party fringes. In New York, that means the far Left. . . .<br />With crime soaring and the quality of life plummeting, one would expect candidates to run on restoring law and order. But, in line with a seemingly inexorable national pattern, most of the candidates want to keep as many people out of jail as possible, even for serious crimes. In cities across the country, a coordinated effort is afoot to decriminalize supposed “crimes of poverty,” which means non-prosecution of “low-level offenses” that result from addiction, homelessness, or being poor.<br />A tough-on-crime candidate could run a no-nonsense campaign advocating for victims and safer streets, of course. But the nature of the Democratic primary system is that anyone who runs even slightly to the right of the field gets cast as a right-winger. The number of people in jail in Manhattan is at a historical low—but not low enough, say almost all the candidates. This is the logic of “progress” as a political principle: we aim at perfection, and since our previous efforts have been insufficient toward that goal, we must redouble our commitment. The nature of the dynamic encourages everyone to shift the median position further to the left. Yesterday’s radical firebrand becomes today’s tepid centrist; today’s moderate will be tomorrow’s reactionary.</td>

      <td>Gov. Ducey’s plan is being stymied by a few Republican holdouts.</td>
      <td>Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey is trying to pass a 2.5% flat tax, which is the stuff of Republican dreams. The hang-up is that the GOP controls the state Legislature with the slimmest of margins. The Senate is 16-14. The House is 31-29. So a single Republican holdout in either chamber can kill reform that is sorely needed.<br />Arizona used to be a relatively low-tax state, with a top rate on personal income of 4.5%. Last year voters narrowly approved a ballot measure to add a 3.5% surtax on residents earning $250,000 or more, in the case of single filers, with the money earmarked for teachers. That means next April the top rate will be 8%, the ninth-highest in the country, beating Connecticut, Illinois, and all of Arizona’s neighbors except California. Not good for the state’s competitiveness.<br />The Legislature can’t repeal the surtax approved by the public, but Mr. Ducey’s plan would reduce the economic damage: The Legislature is considering a flat tax of 2.5%. That would be a tax cut for everybody, since Arizona’s lowest rate today is 2.59%. There still would effectively be a second bracket, kicking in at $250,000, because of the voter-passed surtax.<br />Yet the bill would offer help there, too. It says that wealthy Arizonans couldn’t be charged a total income-tax rate above the old 4.5%. In other words, once the teachers collected their surtax of 3.5%, the state would only get to take another 1%. That would put Arizona back into contention: Excluding the states without income taxes, 4.5% is the fifth-lowest top rate in the country.<br />Two weeks ago the flat tax failed in the House on a tie vote. “We need not mirror the federal government and continue with the borrowing and debt,” said the lone GOP dissenter, Rep. David Cook. But Arizona has a $1 billion budget surplus, and a big point of Mr. Ducey’s plan is to undo the new 8% top rate before it can start to drag down the state’s economy. Another sticking point is the proposal’s effect on cities, which receive a 15% cut of the state’s income-tax revenue. The haggling has dragged on, with Republicans on both sides of the negotiation.</td>

      <td>KABUL—Every few hours this weekend, the Taliban released videos of triumphant insurgents inspecting yet another Afghan district headquarters that had been lost in battle by government forces or surrendered without a fight.<br />Some of these districts, a unit equivalent to American counties, are too remote or sparsely populated to warrant defending as the overstretched Afghan military, shorn of vital U.S. air support, refocuses on protecting the country’s major population centers.<br />Trained and equipped by the U.S. and Western allies for nearly two decades, the Afghan security forces, numbering roughly 260,000 men, should be strong enough to prevent the Taliban from seizing power in the immediate aftermath of the American military withdrawal that is nearing completion.<br />Yet, the seemingly never-ending succession of battlefield setbacks that suddenly accelerated this weekend is beginning to create a perception of inevitability about a Taliban takeover. It is a perception that, unless quickly reversed, risks snowballing into a self-fulfilling prophecy, Afghan officials warn.<br />Nearly two dozen of Afghanistan’s 387 districts were taken over by the Taliban, mostly in northern Afghanistan, on Saturday and Sunday, adding to some 30 others seized by the insurgents across the country since early May, according to local reports. The Taliban have also reached the outskirts of several provincial capitals.</td>

      <td>The debt crisis has grown far worse since 1994, when we headed a bipartisan panel.</td>
      <td>President Clinton asked us in 1994 to chair the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform to study the future of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and recommend measures to assure their long-term viability. Reforms of these popular programs were so politically fraught that finding consensus on solutions proved impossible during our tenure in the Senate.<br />But there was near unanimity within the commission on the scale of the problem. Entitlements were on an unsustainable trajectory. They consumed an ever-growing share of federal spending. In 1994 the budget deficit was $203 billion (2.8% of gross domestic product), and the national debt was $3.4 trillion (47.8% of GDP).<br />The crisis we identified 27 years ago seems negligible given where the debt stands today. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in January 2020 that annual budget deficits will exceed $1 trillion, and that the debt—then hovering at $17.2 trillion—would more than double as a share of the economy over the next 30 years. These numbers don’t take into account $65 trillion of unfunded liabilities for Social Security and Medicare. The CBO now projects that, under current law, the deficit will reach $1.9 trillion in 10 years and the debt will skyrocket from 102% to 202% of GDP within 30 years.<br />The words “current law” are critical as the CBO forecasts only what will happen should government make no changes in spending and tax policies. But President Biden has already proposed $5 trillion in additional spending over the next 10 years, much of it for new or expanded entitlements, labeled “infrastructure” and “investment.”<br />Beyond the numbers, the biggest difference between then and now is that in 1994 both parties worried about deficits and debt. Today, neither Democrats nor Republicans seem to care. Under President Trump, the national debt grew from 76% of GDP to 100%. Under Mr. Biden’s first budget proposal, the debt is expected to reach 117% of GDP by 2031.</td>

      <td>In 1921, a magazine writer proposed a scenic trail from Georgia to Maine. Today 3 million visitors hike some portion of the trail every year.</td>
      <td>Nobody knows exactly how long the Appalachian Trail is. It’s about 2,200 miles as the shoe walks, from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine, but the length changes constantly as the trail is rerouted in response to flood, fire and traffic. Official guides have variously given the length as 2,144 miles, 2,159 miles and “more than 2,150 miles.” In “The Appalachian Trail: A Biography” Philip D’Anieri, a lecturer in architecture and regional planning at the University of Michigan, provides deft, engaging profiles of a dozen people who were instrumental in the trail’s history. These range from Arnold Guyot, who literally put the Appalachian Mountains on the map, to Bill Bryson, whose bestselling “A Walk in the Woods” resulted in a 45% increase in “thru-hikers”—those who travel the entire length of the trail in a single trip. Not bad for a travel writer who walked only 10% of the trail.<br />It helps to remember that in one important aspect the Appalachian Mountains are less than 200 years old. For most of America’s history, the area was a white space on the map, unimproved land suited neither to agriculture nor industry. The roads and passes through the mountains, and not the mountains themselves, were what mattered when the country was young. What’s more, the physical isolation of the mountains was such that as recently as 1899 one writer wrote in the Atlantic Monthly that it was a longer journey from northern Ohio to Kentucky than from America to Europe, “for one day’s ride brings us into the eighteenth century.” There were local names for the various ranges—the Alleghenies, the Smokies, the White Mountains. There were no “Appalachian Mountains.”<br />Into this wilderness came Arnold Guyot, a Swiss divinity student turned scientist. Between 1848 and 1858 he measured, mapped and described hundreds of mountains, bushwhacking his way up and down many of them. If rhododendron thickets rendered forward progress impossible—a particular problem in the southern regions—he got down on all fours and followed bear trails. A small, wiry man, Guyot routinely walked bigger outdoorsmen into the ground. A friend who hiked with him up New Hampshire’s Mount Washington during a rain storm of hurricane-strength winds said that the experience was “about the hardest tramping in the woods I was ever associated with.” The indefatigable Guyot was the guy who filled in the white space.<br />People have always tended to see what they wanted or needed to see in the mountains. Before he succeeded in fashioning himself into the sage of the American outdoors, Horace Kephart, Mr. D’Anieri tells us, was at various times “a child of the prairies, an urbane East Coast scholar, a quiet St. Louis librarian” as well as “a drunken ne’er-do-well.” Kephart had been on track for a conventional life when he all but ditched his wife and family and took to the woods, establishing himself as the “Dean of American Campers.” The transformation took, but at a great price. “My father was not a normal man,” Mr. D’Anieri quotes Kephart’s daughter as saying. “So my mother in St. Louis became just a buffer between husband and babies.”<br />Kephart greatly exaggerated and simplified his metamorphosis into a woodsman. Nonetheless, his book “Camping and Woodcraft” (1906) contained notes on everything an aspiring outdoorsman needed to know, from fire-building to choosing underwear. Drawers, for example, should fit snugly in the crotch, be loose at the knee and not be so thick as to chafe. He recommended safety pins to hold up socks—this was long before elastic fabric—since garters impeded circulation. The book was a runaway bestseller in the U.S.—even among readers who had no intention of ever abandoning the city—and garnered letters of praise from as far away as England.</td>

      <td>Legal challenges to an extremely narrow vote are a fundamental part of democracy.</td>
      <td>During the Peruvian presidential campaign earlier this year, socialist candidate Pedro Castillo told voters that he would nationalize the assets of foreign investors. He did not say whether this would apply to Chinese corporations that own billions of dollars of Peruvian mining interests. But predicting that it won’t isn’t exactly going out on a limb.<br />Mr. Castillo is a rabid anticapitalist backed by Peru’s extreme left. He’s a perfect partner for Beijing, which doesn’t even pretend to care about corruption or human rights. China is eager to increase its political and economic influence in South America, and it made inroads into Peru when, in May 2019, then-President Martin Vizcarra—who was later impeached on corruption charges and removed from office—signed on to its Belt and Road Initiative.<br />The China card that Mr. Castillo is expected to play is one reason Peruvians, along with the U.S. and other democracies, have an interest in a transparent review of contested votes from the June 6 runoff presidential election. But it isn’t the only one.<br />The difference between vote totals for Mr. Castillo and his center-right rival, Keiko Fujimori, is extremely narrow. If Mr. Castillo is declared the winner he has threatened to use his slim majority as justification to tear up the country’s economically liberal constitution and replace it with something closer to Venezuela’s. It isn’t hyperbole to say that he believes that 50.1% of the vote entitles the winner to steamroll the rights of the other 49.9%.<br />This is no reason to deny Mr. Castillo a victory if he won fair and square. But it strengthens the case for maximum transparency, which can only be guaranteed by an impartial hearing for both sides. If Mr. Castillo can be taken at his word, Peruvian freedom is at stake.</td>

But scrapping roughly 950 flights from the schedule is the latest sign of how tricky it has been for airlines to scale up after a year of depressed demand. The changes also illustrate how companies are trying to adjust to the post-pandemic normal, with the rapid rise in travel pressuring vacation-rental operators and rental-car companies as well.<br />More robust schedules and fuller flights mean more difficulties when things go wrong. American is trying to avoid a repeat of its disastrous summer in 2019, when bad weather and a feud with the airline’s mechanics snarled operations, an American executive said.<br />Storms that hit some of American’s biggest hubs several days this month, causing delays and cancellations, contributed to the airline’s decision to cut back to have more breathing room when unexpected problems arise, the airline said.<br />While most customers will still be able to make it to their destinations the same day, some will be moved onto earlier or later flights, or connect over a different hub, and some might receive refunds if the new flights aren’t workable, the American executive said.</td>

Short-term rentals inherently attract the unruly, drunken, loud and obnoxious, and are the new “go to” for weekend-destination events at the former home next door. What your nonresident neighbor-owner neglects to tell you is that you will be his unpaid property manager, calling the police at all hours of the day and night.<br />This dynamic, encapsulated in “Nantucket’s Short-Term War” (Mansion, June 11), is the nightmare now dawning on homeowners who were long under the mistaken impression that single-family residential zoning meant no businesses allowed. This is exactly what short-term rental properties are—businesses.<br />What is most galling is the specious argument in defense of short-term rentals brought forth by many second homeowners who say they can’t afford to own a second home without the rental income needed to help pay the mortgage. What this truly means is that their neighbors will be subsidizing their lifestyle with the loss in value of their own homes and their inherent right to peaceful enjoyment. If this is what second homeowners are saying, then they can’t afford a second home.<br />Nantucket is one of countless communities fighting back against the wholesale gutting of residential zoning by revenue-hungry municipalities and the real-estate lobby. It is high time that homeowners move to take back their neighborhoods.<br />John Crow</td>

      <td>Those acting in the name of ‘economic justice’ need to pay more attention to basic economic indicators.</td>
      <td>Inflation, always a key economic metric, is especially important to watch now as it threatens to undermine, if not completely erode, the Biden administration’s gargantuan spending thus far on behalf of poor and working-class Americans—its “economic justice” agenda (“Inflation Jumps to 13-Year High,” Page One, June 11). The effects of inflation not only are greater, but disproportionately greater, for poorer people. Those with higher incomes often offset price increases (goods, services) with increased income. Furthermore, prices often increase more for basic needs than for luxury items, a phenomenon economists call “inflation inequality.” Simply put, low-income families’ budgets will stress and strain as they confront the coming rising costs of the essentials they need (food, energy, transport, child care).<br />The economic well-being of the most economically vulnerable Americans too often tends to be discussed as a matter of the latest Washington program or policy. Those acting in the name of “economic justice” need to pay more attention to basic economic indicators such as employment rates by demographic group, incomes and, yes, inflation, if we want to truly understand what’s happening not just to the economy in a general sense but specifically to the most vulnerable within it.<br />As coming waves of inflation will demonstrate, the fundamentals—and not the latest federal government initiative—will most directly characterize and affect the economic well-being of the most economically vulnerable in our country.<br />Prof. Todd L.

      <td>California finally opened up on June 15. We can actually set foot inside stores and restaurants without having to wear a mask. Freedom! And it’s about time. More than 70% of California adults have at least one vaccine jab. The state’s seven-day average number of daily coronavirus cases is down 98% from its peak in January. Herds can romp. It’s over—except, well, Gov. Gavin Newsom will keep his emergency powers.<br />In case he changes his mind about reopening, I made a trip to Trader Joe’s to stock up on Ultra Chocolate ice cream. And yes, I see the irony of buying the least healthy item in a store stocked with expensive organic bruised bananas and dairy-free cashew cheese alternative mozzarella-style shreds. The parking lot was practically a showroom for Teslas and Prii.<br />I counted 50 shoppers, 49 masked. Did these people not get the unmasking memo? I was the only one not wearing a mask, and I was loving it. California is operating on an honor system, and though I’m fully vaxxed, I wish I weren’t. That very same day, Mr. Newsom was at Disneyland doling out $1.5 million prizes (taxpayer money) to 10 winners of a California vaccine lottery. That beats President Biden’s “Get a shot and have a beer.” Lesson learned: Next pandemic, I wait to get paid.<br />Maybe those 49 maskers haven’t yet been vaccinated? The adage is: To find the next measles outbreak, find towns with Whole Foods supermarkets. Those places usually have high concentrations of antivaxxers. That adage could probably apply to Trader Joe’s, too.<br />But this vaccine is different. Statistics suggest red-staters are the ones declining the Covid-19 vaccines, not the usual dissidents inspired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I’d bet good money all 49 of my fellow shoppers are topped up with vaccine-induced antibodies. So who exactly are they protecting? Me? Thanks but no thanks.</td>

      <td>The Communist Party blunts its past criticism of Mao’s Cultural Revolution. America should push back.</td>
      <td>Xi Jinping‘s new history of Chinese communism has little room for criticism of Mao Zedong. In February Mr. Xi issued a revised version of “A Brief History of the Communist Party of China,” the official party history, in preparation for next month’s commemoration of the party’s 100th anniversary. This edition plays down Mao’s atrocities, in particular softening the party’s historic 1981 condemnation of the Cultural Revolution. That places Mr. Xi in the dubious company of dictators for whom “yesterday’s weather can be changed by decree”—a power George Orwell attributed in 1942 to Franco, Stalin and Hitler.<br />Many of the victims of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, a 1966-76 purge of “counterrevolutionary elements,” were respected party leaders who Mao feared might threaten his personal power. Mr. Xi’s father, who had previously been demoted from vice premier to deputy manager of a tractor factory, was jailed and beaten. The teenage Mr. Xi suffered as well, and his half-sister, Xi Heping, died after persecution by the revolution’s Red Guards.<br />It is striking that Mr. Xi would play down this crime that brutalized his family and him. Perhaps because he is now emulating Mao in seeking to become general secretary for life, he wants the Chinese people to know as little as possible about the chaotic final decade of Mao’s prolonged reign. The analysis of Mao’s mistakes in launching the Cultural Revolution, which likely left a death toll of more than one million, is largely replaced by a lengthy discussion of Chinese achievements in that period.<br />This sanitizing of history, reported by the party-affiliated Sing Tao Daily in Hong Kong as a straightforward news item, might not be obvious to the average noncommunist reader. Communist ideological debates are often deliberately obscure. But party members must pay punctilious attention even to small changes in convoluted language. Failure to do so can have serious consequences.<br />In April the party launched a telephone hot line and online platform for reporting “historical nihilists,” who fail to comply with the official party line. Since becoming president in 2013, Mr. Xi has condemned historical nihilists in the Soviet Union for repudiating Stalin and causing “chaos in Soviet ideology.” That history, and the Soviet Union’s eventual fall, informs his reasoning in revising Chinese communist history. The change is a warning to party members to avoid harsh criticism of Mao or the Cultural Revolution. Under Mr. Xi’s anticipated lifelong reign, there will be no Chinese equivalent of Nikita Khrushchev’s 1956 “secret speech” exposing the crimes of the Stalin era.</td>

      <td>Move by VF, which also owns Vans and Timberland, shows the difficulty in catering to Western consumers and China</td>
      <td>In late March, the maker of North Face jackets and Vans sneakers quietly took down a statement raising concern about allegations of forced labor in China’s cotton-rich Xinjiang region. Rival fashion company  H&M  had just been erased from China’s internet for a similar statement.<br />Three other big apparel companies also pulled or altered statements critical of Xinjiang from their websites in the days that followed the boycott of H&M, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. At Denver-based  VF Corp. , though, executives quickly convened to deliberate over what they felt was the right thing to do, according to a person familiar with the matter. Twenty-four hours after pulling its statement, the company posted a new, shorter statement reaffirming its stance.<br />The moves, previously unreported, show the mounting pressure facing Western companies doing business in China. The country has become one of the biggest and fastest-growing fashion markets in the world, and apparel companies have flooded in. But China’s government—and many of its shoppers—have become newly assertive in dumping brands they see as critical of Beijing.<br />Many big apparel companies, meanwhile, have made environmental and human-rights concerns central to their image in recent years, responding to demands by activists, governments and consumers in their home markets.<br />“Younger customers are more interested than ever in buying brands that reflect their values and represent a mission and purpose,” said Oliver Chen, an analyst with the investment bank  Cowen Inc.  “On the flip side, Western brands are searching for growth, and they don’t want to be locked out of the Chinese market.”</td>

      <td>What’s the best way to answer this thorny question during a job interview: How do you feel about working from home?<br />This question will almost certainly come up if the job you’ve applied for could conceivably be done remotely. Prepare as much as you can before the interview so you have a sense of what the company’s current policies are. And then approach the question with honesty and the expectation that, even if your preferences aren’t aligned with the employer’s policies, it might still be possible to find solutions that work for both of you.<br />“Employers know this is on people’s minds,” says Alexandra Carter, director of the Mediation Clinic at Columbia Law School and an expert in negotiations. “We just went through a pandemic that basically de facto renegotiated the standard employment contract.”<br />Around 35% of employed U.S. workers moved quickly to working from home as the pandemic spread in the spring of 2020. Now companies are starting to nail down remote-work policies for a future when vaccinations are widespread and fears about the virus recede. Many individuals have developed strong preferences, and they may be at odds with those of prospective employers.<br />Before going into an interview, do your due diligence. The more you know before you’re asked the question, the better off you’ll be, says Debra Wheatman, president of Careers Done Write, a marketing and branding company for individuals. “Speak to people who work there, look up news about the company, figure out what their culture is and how they operate,” she says. “For most people, because they don’t do that, that’s why mistakes are made.”</td>

      <td>Shopping online can feel like magic. A couple of clicks and a few days later, a box is on your doorstep. But it can also feel like playing a game of digital dodgeball. Shoppers must tread carefully to avoid the fake reviews, unsafe or mislabeled products, or counterfeit goods hiding behind legitimate-seeming listings.<br />That’s because we are living in the Marketplace Era. Third-party sellers peddle their wares via the digital bazaars of  Amazon ,   Walmart ,  Target—and now even Urban Outfitters and J.Crew. The deal could be seen as a win-win: Customers get a larger selection of products and retailers get a cut of more sales. The problem? It adds a layer of mystery for shoppers. Instead of buying from that site you know, you’re buying from a seller you don’t know, and often it’s a product whose brand you’ve never heard of.<br />Plus, policies for returns and refunds might be different than items sold directly by the site. Most don’t vet third-party products for quality. And the competition between sellers is so intense, many manipulate their listings to boost ratings.<br />After years of covering the ways in which marketplaces can be manipulated, I’ve developed three key tenets for shopping on the internet:<br />• Know who is selling what you’re buying.</td>

Not polite, enforced quiet, like tennis quiet, or library quiet, but shocked quiet—the abrupt hush that comes when a home crowd is confronted with precisely what it didn’t want to see.<br />Right up until then, it all seemed to be rolling Brooklyn’s way. This was Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, between the Milwaukee Bucks and the host Nets, and though the game had been anyone’s to take, and pushed into overtime, the arena swirled with confidence, if for no other reason than Brooklyn had him: Kevin Durant, the most fluid, ethereal big man in the sport, who somehow makes any shot look graceful, who had already swished a balletic jumper with time expiring in regulation to push the game to OT.<br />The arena exploded after that one. Durant thought he’d hit a 3-pointer to end it—“I thought it was a ‘Tracy,’ but my big-ass foot stepped on the line,” he said later—but the shot kept Brooklyn alive. The crowd screamed and hugged as security swarmed the sidelines, and it appeared like the room was levitating at the corner of Atlantic and Flatbush. Noise like this had been a Nets fantasy ever since the team alighted from the Jersey swampland, and after nearly a decade of meh-to-rocky seasons, it was actually happening.<br />It was in the stars: Brooklyn would win this Game 7. Then: it’d be onto the Conference Finals, and the Finals-Finals, and maybe the franchise’s first championship. Yes, these Nets were banged up, missing Kyrie Irving, playing with half of a James Harden, but Durant was there, and he’d get it done. Come on. He was Kevin Durant!</td>

Earlier this month, coal miner  Peabody Energy Corp. ,  offshore drilling contractor  Transocean Ltd.  and retailer  Express Inc. ,  all announced plans to sell stock, betting equity markets will support them despite heavy debt loads, recent losses and industry headwinds.<br />Selling stock isn’t the typical way for distressed companies to grab a lifeline.

But pulling off remote work in the Aloha state takes more than a plane ticket and a laptop.<br />The pandemic devastated the state’s economy. According to the Hawaii Tourism Authority, visitor arrivals fell 97.6% between August 2019 and August the following year. Employment in the state’s leisure and hospitality sector, which accounts for nearly one in five jobs, fell 53% between February and August 2020, according to the Pew Center.<br />Thanks in part to state initiatives—including pre-arrival coronavirus testing for visitors and marketing campaigns wooing remote workers—tourism is on the rebound. In April, visitors reached nearly 500,000, compared with roughly 4,500 in April 2020.<br />One program, called Movers and Shakas (named after the friendly Y-shaped hand gesture with extended thumb and pinkie that means “hang loose”), was launched in December with local business leaders. It offers free airfare to remote workers who commit to staying at least a month and participate in volunteer activities. The program’s 50 spots attracted 90,000 applications. Applications for the second round will open this month.<br />As it is elsewhere, reliable Wi-Fi is the litmus test for many. Some areas of the Hawaiian islands, especially rural regions, lack robust broadband or cellular infrastructure.

Then they pushed higher, ultimately powering the S&P 500 to a 16% gain for 2020.<br />This year, as the economy strengthens and vaccinations diminish the pandemic in the U.S., that synchronized march has broken down. Investors have broadened their sights beyond the familiar names whose technology businesses thrived as many Americans switched to working, shopping and socializing at home. With a re-energized economy creating opportunity across industries, money managers have options, as well as renewed scrutiny for stocks whose lofty valuations and widespread popularity could limit further upside.<br />While Alphabet Class A and Facebook shares are up 37% and 21%, respectively, other members of the group have weighed on the market. Amazon shares are up 7.1% in 2021, lagging behind the 11% rise in the benchmark S&P 500. Apple and Netflix have fared even worse, down 1.7% and 7.4% for the year.</td>

Ms. Le Pen has long blamed a string of attacks in recent years on what she considers soft immigration policies that she says allow radical strains of Islam to take root in the country and fuel violence—a link the Macron government rejects.</td>

      <td>Natural-gas prices are starting the summer air-conditioning season nearly twice as high as they were a year ago.<br />Demand for the fuel is picking up as the world’s economies reopen and as Americans dial down their thermostats for what is expected to be a hot summer. Meanwhile, U.S. producers have stuck to the skimpy drilling plans they sketched out when prices were lower, eliminating the glut that was keeping them depressed.<br />Natural-gas futures ended Friday at $3.215 per million British thermal units, up 96% from a year ago and the highest price headed into summer since 2017. Futures traded even higher—and regional spot prices jumped—when triple-digit temperatures baked the Southwest earlier this month. Analysts expect prices to be even higher later in the year when it is time to fire up furnaces.<br />It isn’t just in the U.S. where gas is running high. Dutch gas futures, a barometer for prices in Western Europe, have more than doubled over the past year—including a sharp rise since February—to multiyear highs. In Asia, imported liquefied natural gas is fetching more than five times what it did last June, beckoning tankers full of chilled shale gas across the Pacific.<br />More expensive gas has stoked demand in international markets for coal, with which gas competes to fuel power plants. Futures prices for thermal coal loaded at a terminal in Newcastle, Australia, have more than doubled from a year ago. The benchmark price has added 27% over the past month and hasn’t been so high in nearly a decade.</td>

      <td>Freight carriers have long resisted calls to make more room on their tracks for passenger trains</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Amtrak and the Biden administration have a $75 billion plan to transform passenger train travel across America—but aside from funding, the biggest challenge might be getting the nation’s freight railroads to get on board.<br />The nation’s seven major freight carriers have long resisted calls to make more room on their tracks for trains carrying people rather than coal, grain and steel. Current and former federal officials say the greatest impediment to Amtrak’s national expansion could be finding a way to work with freight carriers.<br />Amtrak owns most of the tracks where it currently offers its flagship service—the Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston—but it relies in most of the rest of the country on access to the tracks owned by freight railroads.<br />That arrangement is a result of Amtrak’s DNA. Congress created the company in 1970 as railroads faced financial ruin. Amtrak bailed the railroads out of the least profitable portion of their business: moving people from place to place.<br />By law, Amtrak trains can take precedence over freight when running over those networks. In practice, according to Amtrak, its customers frequently suffer delays caused by freight-train interference. The two sides have battled for years over new standards for on-time performance.</td>

      <td>The Islamic Republic of Iran isn’t a real democracy. But the result of Friday’s presidential election still reveals important truths about the government that the U.S. and Europe are trying to appease on nuclear weapons.<br />Ebrahim Raisi, the country’s chief justice, won the presidency with about 62% of the vote, according to preliminary results published Saturday. Sometimes discussed as a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei—who wields the real power in Iran, particularly over foreign affairs—Mr. Raisi had the race wrapped up before the polls opened.<br />The Guardian Council, Iran’s election watchdog, has long barred candidates not to the Supreme Leader’s liking. But past races have been competitive and even unpredictable, giving Iranians a small voice in deciding their future. Approved candidates are always loyal to the Islamic Republic and its revolutionary ideology. But some, like lame-duck President Hassan Rouhani, spoke the language of moderation and reform even as they followed the Khamenei line.<br />Iranians understand they live in a dictatorship but have often voted in high numbers to choose their least bad option. Initial results suggest this year’s race had turnout around 50%—down from more than 70% four years ago and the lowest of any vote since 1979. Millions decided to boycott this year’s election as the country’s already small spectrum of permissible views grew even smaller.<br />Last month the Guardian Council culled dozens of candidates, including many ostensible centrists or reformers. Of the seven candidates approved to run, three dropped out shortly before the contest—paving the way for Mr. Raisi, who is typically described as a hard-liner or ultraconservative cleric.</td>

Jared Polis signed legislation Saturday making Colorado the first state to repeal what is known as a pre-emption law. Previously the state was one of 45 that banned cities from enacting firearms regulations, according to a tally by the National Rifle Association.<br />The push for the repeal of the pre-emption law in Colorado came after a gunman shot and killed 10 people at a Boulder grocery store March 22. Ten days before the attack, a Boulder County District Court judge blocked the city from enforcing its 2018 ban on the sale and possession of semiautomatic firearms that it defined as assault weapons, as well as high-capacity magazines. The judge cited the state’s pre-emption law in his decision.<br />Mayor Sam Weaver said the legal case over the ban would most likely be dismissed under the new state law, putting the ban back into effect. If the city needs to take any other steps to enforce the ban, it will do so, he said. The law would apply to the city’s two gun shops, one of which is near a high school, he said.<br />“In theory, if we didn’t have this law, you could go buy an assault weapon, and then walk across the street and shoot a bunch of students,” said Mr. Weaver, a Democrat. “So we would like to have it in place to prevent rash actions with assault weapons in Boulder.”</td>

Lordstown, semi-truck maker  Nikola Corp.  and electric-car maker  Canoo Inc.  all have share prices that are in line with, or above, the prices from when they struck deals to go public by merging with special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, last year.<br />Nikola has a market capitalization of $6.5 billion, up more than 60% since it struck its deal to list last year. Months later, the company’s executive chairman resigned after a short seller accused the company of misrepresenting its technology. The company, which denied allegations of fraud, then scuttled multiple new types of vehicles it previously advertised as key to its business, and a partnership with  General Motors Co.  largely fell apart.<br />Canoo announced this spring it dropped numerous aspects of its business plan that it sold to investors months earlier, and its CEO, CFO and co-founder all left the company. It has a roughly $2.4 billion market capitalization, unchanged from when it struck the deal to list publicly. None of the three companies have begun commercial production of vehicles.</td>

They’re in billions of products with built-in electronics, including iPhones, personal computers and cars—all without any obvious sign they came from TSMC, which does the manufacturing for better-known companies that design them, like Apple Inc. and  Qualcomm Inc.<br />TSMC has emerged over the past several years as the world’s most important semiconductor company, with enormous influence over the global economy. With a market cap of around $550 billion, it ranks as the world’s 11th most valuable company.<br />Its dominance leaves the world in a vulnerable position, however. As more technologies require chips of mind-boggling complexity, more are coming from this one company, on an island that’s a focal point of tensions between the U.S. and China, which claims Taiwan as its own.<br />Analysts say it will be difficult for other manufacturers to catch up in an industry that requires hefty capital investments. And TSMC can’t make enough chips to satisfy everyone—a fact that has become even clearer amid a global shortage, adding to the chaos of supply bottlenecks, higher prices for consumers and furloughed workers, especially in the auto industry.</td>

      <td>Inheriting a set of golf clubs gave the author a way to connect with the man who abandoned him before he was born</td>
      <td>For most of my life, I had no interest in learning about my father. On a stateside leave from the German front in 1944, he had married my mother, impregnated her and returned to the war. He never came back. Until I was in college, all my mother told me about him was that he was “missing in World War II.”<br />Twenty years later, on a visit to my college dorm, my mother revealed that my father was still alive. In a few muttered words, she told me that he had been sending her $100 a month in child support and she now wanted to share the money with me. I was touched by her generosity but refused with murmured thanks, letting the revelation pass without further discussion or reflection. I remember feeling embarrassed by my mother’s implicit admission that she had hidden the real facts of my father’s disappearance for my entire childhood. She lived another 42 years, and we never brought up the matter again.<br />Why was I so incurious about the fate and whereabouts of my missing father? I suppose I didn’t want to open a cauldron of emotions that might disrupt the path I was creating for my life. As a child, I had sensed that the way my mother answered questions about my father signaled feelings other than simple grief at his loss. When I actually heard from her that he had abandoned us, I deduced that he was an irresponsible cad. As a college student still figuring out who I was, my instinct was to avoid identification with someone who could be a negative role model.<br />It was my own daughter, more than 40 years later, who finally introduced me to my father—not in person (he had been dead for 20 years) but as someone I could visualize (I had never seen a picture of him) and learn about. She had been searching online for records of “Philip Damon,” the grandfather she had never met, and uncovered an oral history of the United States Information Agency. A veteran diplomat was asked, seemingly out of nowhere, “When you were in Thailand, did you know Phil Damon?”<br />The diplomat answered yes, he did know Damon from their days in Germany and Thailand. My father had joined the Foreign Service in Germany after his discharge from the army and, having divorced my mother, soon married a “delightful” French ballerina, the diplomat said. In the 1950s he was transferred to the USIA branch in Bangkok, where he and his second wife became close to the king and queen. The diplomat also noted that my father was a “great golfer.”</td>

And when a global pandemic arrived, we found those traits outweighed the mobility benefits of phones and tablets, especially since we were usually on home Wi-Fi and plugged into the wall socket.<br />Computer sales had generally been in decline for the past decade, and those declines were expected to continue for the foreseeable future. During the pandemic, there were increases in PC sales of 50% or more a quarter, compared with the prior year, according to technology market research firm IDC.

      <td>With consumer prices rising sharply, central bankers are having to work hard to resist the temptation to lift interest rates. A real-estate boom could make the job even tougher.<br />Monetary policy is already being tightened. So far in 2021, there have been eight rate cuts and 19 increases, the latter by central banks in Russia, Brazil and Turkey among others, data by  Bank of America  shows. The anticipation of pandemic-era monetary stimulus coming to an end in rich nations too is weighing on investor sentiment. Stocks have taken a hit since Federal Reserve officials released projections Wednesday showing that rates could go up in 2023.<br />Then, on Thursday, Norway’s central bank all but guaranteed it will increase borrowing costs in September, placing it far ahead of the Fed and even the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which was the first to spook markets back in March. Developed countries have a lot more leeway to leave rates low than emerging ones, because they suffer far less from volatility in commodity prices and the U.S. dollar. But the Norges Bank said in a statement that it “placed weight on the marked rise in house prices.”<br />Residential property markets around the world are rallying. Norway’s looked frothy far before the pandemic and home prices have risen 12% from January 2020. In the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, prices are up 15%, 13% and 16%, respectively. In China, property is once again emerging as a key driver of economic growth.<br />In theory, central banks set rates based on inflation and, in the Fed’s case, unemployment. After the 2008 mortgage crisis, however, officials in many countries started taking financial imbalances into account as well.</td>

Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign, also supports Ms. Wiley.<br />Meanwhile, the two other top progressive candidates in the Democratic primary—Comptroller Scott Stringer and Dianne Morales—were rocked by turmoil and lost key endorsements. The Working Families Party announced it bumped up Ms. Wiley to its top choice after pulling its support for the other two.<br />Mr. Stringer’s campaign has been clouded by sexual-misconduct allegations, which he denies. Ms. Morales, a former nonprofit housing executive, has faced criticism after campaign staffers formed a union following complaints of toxic working conditions. Ms. Morales has said some of the staffers’ demands would violate campaign-finance laws.<br />A recent poll by PIX-11, NewsNation and Emerson College found that 23% of voters would choose Mr. Adams, followed by 18% for Ms. Wiley. That is a significant surge from the 9% Ms. Wiley scored in a May 25 poll by the same pollsters. Another candidate, former city Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, was a close third, at 17%.</td>

      <td>Look closely, and you’ll start to see packs of young women together wearing near-identical versions of this pricey, viral outfit</td>
      <td>Off Brand is a column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />ON A RECENT summer afternoon in the upscale Hamptons village of Sag Harbor, N.Y., a pre-teen girl holding her mother’s hand reverently approached the store LoveShackFancy. The shop looks as if it was decorated by a childlike empress on a sugar high—like its sister branches in Southampton, Dallas, Austin, Palm Beach, Los Angeles, Newport Beach, Calif., and Manhattan’s Upper East Side and West Village neighborhoods. It’s drenched in climbing ivy and fresh and fake flowers, and packed to the gills with dolls, vintage suitcases, gilded mirrors, chandeliers and more ruffles than high tea at Marie Antoinette’s Petit Trianon. As speakers piped in Rihanna singing, “We found love in a hopeless place,” a fit, frilly-dressed saleswoman hummed along. When the tween had made her way to the cult boutique’s true mecca—its “ribbon bar”—she FaceTimed a friend to consult on the best trimmings to personalize the brand’s ultra-popular dresses and miniskirts.<br />A LoveShackFancy minidress or skirt is the lynchpin of the tween and teen status look of the moment, which also includes bare legs, sneakers (often shabby-chic Golden Gooses or white Nike Air Force Ones) and sometimes hoodies by streetwear brands like Off White. The look’s Ground Zero is the area around the LoveShackFancy boutique in the Upper East Side, a privileged enclave where packs of private-school tweens parade down the streets in near-identical outfits. Thanks, however, to the democratizing effects of social media and rampant dupes, clones of those real-life Gossip Girls can also be found everywhere from Gothenburg to Grosse Pointe.<br />Jill Kargman, an Upper East Side resident and one of the neighborhood’s saltiest chroniclers, has clocked the trend both in her own adolescent brood and among tweens she sees out and about. “You see a gaggle approaching with LoveShack florals and ruffles with the Golden Goose sneakers...You just see packs on the street walking up Madison Avenue matching,” she observed. “It’s so funny.”<br />Ms. Kargman sees the look as a sweeter, more appropriate alternative to the previous tween status outfit: bodycon dresses. “I used to feel horrified when my 18-year-old was more of a tween, and....wearing those BCBG bandage dresses that look sprayed on. I used to say ‘four going on whore,’” she remembers. Although the LoveShackFancy hemlines are short, she said, they’re “tempered by the sweetness of the ruffles and the prints, so [the girls] don’t look like little skanks.” And the sneakers means the look is practical for walking around after school. “I almost think it’s kind of reverse Kardashian,” Ms. Kargman ventured.</td>

Lochte came up 2.7 seconds short in the 200-meter individual medley, his signature event, and failed to qualify for the Tokyo Games.<br />Lochte had been a Team USA sensation alongside Michael Phelps, the sport’s most decorated athlete. But Lochte’s last Olympics ended in disaster. In 2016, he dyed his hair silver and won a gold medal in the 4×200-meter free relay. He is mostly remembered, however, for a dust-up with Brazilian police as the swimming competition was winding down.<br />Lochte claimed that he and three other U.S. swimmers were robbed at gunpoint at a gas station, a story that became an international scandal. Over the course of several days, however, Lochte’s story disintegrated. It turned out that, after a night of partying, at least one of the swimmers had damaged property in the gas-station restroom before being confronted by armed security guards.</td>

      <td>Gov. Ron DeSantis fought to restart cruises, says ‘CDC has been wrong all along’</td>
      <td>A federal judge sided with Florida in its lawsuit over the federal government’s cruise-industry restrictions, a move that could ease the path for ships to resume sailing after a 15-month shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday in Tampa, Fla., on Friday granted the state’s request for a preliminary injunction barring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from enforcing a conditional-sailing order the agency put in place in October. In the order, the CDC set up a framework for cruise lines to restart operations by completing several phases, including test sailings—requirements the cruise industry said were overly burdensome.<br />In his ruling, Judge Merryday said Florida was likely to prevail in its claim that the CDC exceeded its authority in issuing the conditional-sailing order. He contrasted the shutdown approach the agency took with the cruise industry to the voluntary recommendations it has issued for other leisure and hospitality industries, such as hotels, casinos and sporting arenas. And he said decreasing infection rates and increasing vaccinations in the U.S. have reduced the risk of Covid-19 outbreaks aboard ships.<br />“The availability of vaccines and testing and the comparatively trivial incidence of infection on foreign cruises—all quickly identified and confined—commends optimism about the safe operation of sailing in the United States, which enjoys high rates of vaccination and greatly enhanced, onboard containment mechanisms,” Judge Merryday wrote.<br />The judge immediately stayed the injunction until July 18, at which point the conditional-sailing order will become nonbinding guidance for the cruise industry, similar to the tools the agency uses with industries like airlines and railroads. He gave the CDC an opportunity to propose a narrower injunction no later than July 2, and ordered the parties to continue with mediation.</td>

      <td>The Big Apple needs a turnaround—starting with crime control.</td>
      <td>There is much ruin in a city, to adapt Adam Smith, and Bill de Blasio has spent eight years trying to prove it. The progressive’s tenure as mayor has been a catastrophe for New York City in nearly every way, and the only saving grace is that he’s term-limited. The question as Tuesday’s primary approaches is whether voters will try to pull the city out of its downward spiral.<br />We wish the stakes were lower, and eight years ago they were. Mr. de Blasio inherited a prosperous city after 20 years of competent leadership. First Rudy Giuliani challenged the liberal status quo with reforms on crime and public order, welfare, education and regulation. Michael Bloomberg continued the crime reduction under Commissioner Ray Kelly and accelerated school reform under Joel Klein.<br />The city boomed, but voters forgot the bad old days, and the combination of public unions and the gentry left took charge of the political debate. Some progressives now want to disavow Mr. de Blasio, who has become a clownish figure and is deeply unpopular, but he has implemented their agenda.<br />Regulations have crushed small businesses. Bias against charter schools and substituting race for merit in admissions have reversed educational gains. A court ordered the city’s public housing authority put under control of a federal monitor. Wage and pension payoffs for public unions have left the city facing a fiscal crisis despite huge Covid cash infusions from Congress.<br />Above all, crime and disorder have returned amid progressive assaults on police and the anti-crime strategies that worked. Bail reform let repeat offenders free. The mentally ill homeless attack subway riders and pedestrians. The mayor had his police chief disband the anti-crime unit that searched for illegal guns, and shootings have soared. For New Yorkers of a certain age, the slide back to the 1970s is all too clear.</td>

      <td>Democrats know they can’t banish fossil fuels or impose carbon taxes democratically, so the Biden Administration is preparing a backup plan: use courts to impose the anti-carbon policies by decree.<br />Six years ago, progressive plaintiffs claimed to have discovered in the Constitution’s penumbra a right to a “stable climate system” free from “dangerous levels of anthropogenic CO2.” The U.S. government, they argued in a federal lawsuit, has failed to safeguard the youngest generation’s “fundamental constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property” and “essential public trust resources.”<br />The plaintiffs in Juliana v. U.S. sought a court order that required the federal government to develop a plan to “phase out fossil fuel emissions and draw down excess atmospheric CO2.” The Obama and Trump Justice Departments opposed the lawsuit. The Constitution nowhere mentions climate.<br />The plaintiffs also lacked standing to sue because they hadn’t suffered an injury that could be traced to the U.S. government and which courts could redress. Yet a federal judge refused to dismiss the lawsuit. After four years of litigation, a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel held the plaintiffs lacked standing and ordered the district court to dismiss the case.<br />The panel noted the plaintiffs’ injunction request “call[ed] for no less than a fundamental transformation of this country’s energy system, if not that of the industrialized world” and their demands could be met only “by the People’s ‘elected representatives, rather than by federal judges interpreting the basic charter of government for the entire country.’”</td>

But it seems to be evolving into another arm of progressive politics, like the teachers unions. See the AMA’s policy-making meeting this week.<br />Delegates spent much of the time discussing systemic racism in health care and adopted guidelines for workplaces to establish training requirements for explicit and implicit bias and microaggressions. AMA trustee Willarda Edwards called systemic racism “the most serious barrier to the advancement of health equity and appropriate medical care.”<br />Many doctors would disagree with that statement. But the AMA seems to want to enforce ideological conformity in its ranks, including on social media. Delegates also voted to encourage social-media platforms to “crack down on medical misinformation,” including by “altering underlying network dynamics or redesigning platform algorithms.”<br />Social-media platforms have been removing content by doctors who disagree with the progressive lockdown consensus or who suggest that the virus may have leaked from a Chinese lab. Many doctors say their videos recommending early treatment with repurposed antiviral drugs have been censored, including one from a Senate hearing.<br />Social-media censorship suppressed debate on important issues during the pandemic, and the AMA wants to extend the information control to other health subjects. The new AMA policy would ostensibly encourage  Facebook ,  YouTube and others to remove posts by doctors who question progressive orthodoxy on race and identity politics.</td>

The Justice Department claimed the book contained classified information and sought civil penalties from Mr. Bolton while initiating a criminal probe.<br />In June 2020, federal Judge Royce Lamberth refused to stop publication of the book, but condemned Mr. Bolton’s conduct and said the book likely contained classified information. Then in September, Ellen Knight, the head of pre-publication clearance for the National Security Council, gave her side of the story.<br />Through her lawyer, Ms. Knight explained that she worked extensively with Mr. Bolton to filter classified information from the manuscript without constraining his First Amendment right to comment on public affairs. When this process was over, the White House initiated an elaborate series of bureaucratic maneuvers to delay publication, likely because of pressure from Mr. Trump. It pressured Ms. Knight and had a political appointee review the manuscript under an erroneous standard.</td>

Evidence presented at trial, including by a cooperating witness, showed that the conspirators sought help from defunct German payment giant Wirecard AG and met with a former top executive there.<br />A bankruptcy administrator for Wirecard didn’t respond to a request for comment.<br />A lawyer for Mr. Akhavan declined to comment on the sentence.</td>

Mr. Salonen’s tenure was to have begun last fall with a host of inventive programming and a much-touted partnership with eight cutting-edge cultural figures. But the pandemic thwarted those plans.

      <td>No outcome of the Geneva summit was more eye-opening than Joe Biden’s claim to have presented Vladimir Putin with a list of 16 categories of U.S. cyber targets that must remain off-limits to attack.<br />Mr. Biden’s list almost certainly is the same as the one publicly posted by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency last year. It contains no state secrets. U.S. expectations that Mr. Putin will take a proactive hand against Russia’s for-profit hackers are also probably correspondingly low. It would impose costs and risks on Mr. Putin to interfere in a business that’s paying off so handsomely for some of his clients, including officials of his own security services.<br />But calling Mr. Putin’s attention to the list also calls the attention of Russia’s hackers to it, for whom surviving in business means being sensitive to the Kremlin’s ill-defined and often retroactive red lines.<br />Mr. Biden’s threat of retaliation would have been heard too and suggested to Russia’s hackers a new source of risk to their domestic immunity. Mr. Biden specifically mentioned Russia’s oil-field pipelines and elicited from Mr. Putin an agreement that such an attack would “matter” to him.<br />Admittedly this is speculative, but it smells like the U.S. is playing a three-cornered game with Mr. Putin and Russia’s hackers. If so, it fits what we know about how Russia operates. Mr. Putin is far from all-seeing and all-knowing. It also fits what we learned in the aftermath of the Colonial Pipeline hack that caused gasoline shortages in the Eastern U.S., when hackers believed to be part of the Russia-based group Dark Side conspicuously apologized for the collateral damage and pretended to dissolve their organization.</td>

The one that worked beautifully for a while—before it fizzled out in ignominy.<br />My father had only one major character flaw: He was an incorrigible practical joker. One of Dad’s favorite party gags was to soak his right hand under the faucet, then approach a newly arrived guest, hand outstretched. At the last minute, he’d feign a sneeze, covering his face with his right hand, then shake with the wet hand, to the disgust of the recipient, who was caught off guard. My mother or one of us kids had to explain the joke to the mortified guest.<br />Dad died in 2016, but his comedy career peaked in 1973. He was 45 and had aged just enough that he could convincingly pull it off. It didn’t take much squinting at all to see it—seemingly overnight, my dad had become the spitting image of Vice President Spiro Agnew. My father couldn’t resist the new-found celebrity that fate and middle age had handed him.<br />My parents and three other couples would go out to dinner every weekend at some fine Chicago restaurant. They’d take turns paying, and the paying couple would choose the restaurant and make the reservation. When it was my parents’ turn, my father would make the reservation under the name “Spiro” or “Mr. Agnew.” When they arrived at the restaurant, they’d gleefully watch the staff whispering that the vice president was in the house. It was a much simpler time—no omnipresent smartphones to expose the shenanigans. Before the night ended, my dad would fess up and everyone had a good laugh.<br />My dad’s impersonation was a source of great amusement until Oct. 10, 1973, when the real Agnew, embroiled in a bribery and tax-evasion scandal, resigned from office. All of a sudden, the party was over—my dad’s greatest practical joke was kaput. He looked nothing like Gerald Ford.</td>

      <td>Muhammad Ali’s namesake risked his career, wealth and life to promote emancipation.</td>
      <td>In an era of racial “reckoning,” the U.S. seems determined to obliterate statues and other public honors for those, such as Confederate generals, who fought to preserve slavery and racism. But there is no countervailing effort to remember or honor those who risked everything—career, wealth, prominence and personal safety—to promote emancipation.<br />Start with a towering figure who contributed significantly to the cause of liberation and union, Cassius Marcellus Clay. Born in 1810, Clay defied his slave-owning and influential Kentucky family when he became an abolitionist during his student days at Yale. A speech by William Lloyd Garrison, the fiery advocate for emancipation, struck him “as water to a thirsty wayfarer.” Returning home after graduation in 1832, he won four terms in the state Legislature despite his unpopular antislavery views. Clay’s second cousin (and occasional political sponsor) was the state’s most celebrated citizen: Henry Clay, the House speaker and longtime senator.<br />While other antislavery agitators fled the South to escape intimidation and violence, Clay used his inherited wealth to set up an uncompromising abolitionist newspaper in Lexington, named True American. After fighting off a mob of 60 who tried to smash his printing presses, Clay installed two cannons to protect his premises. He also funded Berea College, a Christian institution that became the first college in the South to welcome black students and women.<br />Though Clay might have continued in the role of philanthropist and humanitarian, his combative nature pushed him toward provocation and confrontation. Henry Clay’s biographers David and Jeanne Heidler wrote of Cassius: “A venomous pen was his first weapon of choice, a bowie knife his second, and because he was so effective with the one, he found it wise to have the other handy.”<br />After a heated public debate in 1843, a hired killer assaulted him and aimed a shot directly to his chest. While struggling to remove the bowie knife from the leather scabbard he carried on his belt, Clay unintentionally pulled up the sheath over his stomach. The would-be assassin’s bullet struck the scabbard and lodged itself into the silver blade, before Cash used the knife to slice off his assailant’s nose and an ear.</td>

The banks had been penalized for those actions in 2019 and 2021.<br />The banks that have been cleared will be eligible to work on future issuances and were informed on Friday, the European Commission, which is the trade bloc’s executive arm, said by email. “Their further exclusion from participation in syndicated transactions in EU bond issuances is not warranted,” it said.<br />The EU expects to sell up to €60 billion of long-dated debt this year and €150 billion annually through 2026, and plans to use the funds to support member states’ economic recovery through a mix of grants and loans. The program, the first major pan-European debt program, will eventually raise around €800 billion over five years.</td>

      <td>When President Biden signed legislation making June 19, or Juneteenth, a new national holiday, he set off a race inside corporations to figure out how to mark it and whether to allocate more paid time off to workers.<br />Employers from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and  Bank of America Corp.  to  Stanley Black & Decker Inc.  and Ohio State University were among the organizations around the U.S. that quickly rolled out new holiday policies for workers, with some allowing people to take Friday off with mere hours of notice.<br />A key question for many companies has been whether to grant more paid time off at all. This week’s legislation to create the first federal holiday in nearly four decades came together quickly, prompting companies to make decisions about whether to give time now—or later—or offer a floating holiday or no time off.<br />Some opted to make Friday or Monday a holiday, since June 19 falls on a weekend this year. Other employers said they would offer an extra flex day to take off later. Many more are still trying to decide how to respond.<br />Stanley Black & Decker said it would begin officially observing Juneteenth as a company holiday for all U.S. employees starting in 2022, but also quickly rolled out a companywide day off on Friday.</td>

The Fed’s projections released Wednesday pointed to the prospect of two rate increases in 2023, and Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Friday that the central bank could tighten policy as soon as next year.<br />The comments wrong-footed a market that had become obsessed with the threat of inflation. Volatility rose after slipping throughout the spring, and the asset class that many investors had bet was due to post the steepest drop, U.S. Treasurys, rallied.

      <td>When architects build for themselves, they’re doing more than making a home, or what Le Corbusier called “a machine for living in.” Knowingly or not, they’re writing an autobiography. Emerson said “an institution is the lengthened shadow of one man.” So is a house.<br />Prominent builders who were their own clients include Thomas Jefferson at Monticello and Sir John Soane at his London townhouse-library-museum. The 20th century produced Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin, Walter Gropius in suburban Boston and, the most theatrical, Philip Johnson, creator of the 1949 Glass House in New Canaan, Conn., a weekend escape from his busy Manhattan life. This iconic structure is simple and rich, and open to the public by appointment. It impresses visitors. It also makes them wonder whether they could live here. I doubt that Martha Stewart or any other doyenne of hygge could handle it. Perhaps only Johnson himself could.<br />The house overlooks a rolling, semi-rural landscape, which has grown from five acres to 10 times that size. Even the “Glass House” title has now come to stand, synecdochally, for a congeries of buildings in differing styles that sprang up over almost 50 years. These constitute a melting pot of postwar architectural motifs.<br />Johnson once claimed “I really am a landscape architect.” Everything here began with a site in the woods and a promontory overlooking a pond that enchanted him.<br />The project also had its start with an idea borrowed (if not filched) from a contemporary. Johnson had seen the plans for Mies van der Rohe’s as yet unbuilt Farnsworth House near Chicago. Mies’s asymmetrical glass house is framed by white steel beams and seems to float above the ground. Johnson anchored his own (symmetrical) cube, with its black steel girders and plate glass, to the earth. It is a single room, 54 by 32 feet. A brick cylinder containing the bathroom breaks the linearity.</td>

      <td>An exhibition at MoMA argues that the foundational painter of modern art produced his most groundbreaking work on paper.</td>
      <td>New York<br />Visitors to “Cézanne Drawing” at the Museum of Modern Art may be astonished to learn that critics once complained that the late 19th-century French artist could not draw. With about 280 graphite, ink and gouache drawings and watercolors—over a third of them from private collectors—and a handful of related oil paintings, the staggeringly beautiful show proves otherwise. Organized by Jodi Hauptman, senior curator at MoMA, and associate curator Samantha Friedman, it also argues convincingly that Paul Cézanne (1839-1906), a foundational painter of modern art, produced his most radical work on paper.<br />The exhibition, arranged in broad, thematic terms, opens with loose study sheets and pages from the artist’s sketchbooks. Cézanne drew almost daily over the course of his career, using standard studio materials, and produced more than 2,000 extant works on paper. Though they rarely served as straightforward preparations for his oil paintings, his drawings pull us directly into his potent creative orbit.<br />We glimpse Cézanne’s innovative techniques in his early “Studies of a Rower” (1867-69), where repeated sketches of a single athletic oarsman fill the page. Darkened, blunted and smudged graphite marks combine line and shading in vigorous repeated strokes, and exposed patches of softly shaded gray turn blank paper into highlights. Rather than simply delineating the figure’s contours, such drawings taught the artist how to think about form, movement, modeling and painting itself.<br />Cézanne’s powers of pictorial invention were likewise broached in drawings, as seen in his tiny (2 3/4 by 5 inch), ruthless and furiously painted sketch “The Abduction” (1867). In it, a nude male carries off a nude female and slashes of ink, dark pools of watercolor and opaque touches of gouache resonate with the violence of the scene. At times, it is not the kinship of subject and style, but the cohabitation of disparate images on a page that lends them a strangely unsettling air. In his “Study for The Eternal Feminine” (1870-75), for example—a theatrical picture-within-a-picture scene—the artist appears to be  thinking aloud: Vehement diagonals articulate its compositional thrusts; patches of shadow and light rehearse the role of color; figures tumbling through space or crouched in corners encapsulate the scene’s chaotic maelstrom; and a viewer (an artist?) peers around the corner to watch it all take shape. Far more than the preparatory study its title promises, it offers a window into some of Cézanne’s wildest narrative paintings, and establishes drawing as a quintessential medium for probing the depths of his fearless imagination.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is sharply reducing the number of U.S. antimissile systems in the Middle East in a major realignment of its military footprint there as it focuses the armed services on challenges from China and Russia, administration officials said.<br />The Pentagon is pulling approximately eight Patriot antimissile batteries from countries including Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, according to officials. Another antimissile system known as a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad system, is being withdrawn from Saudi Arabia, and jet fighter squadrons assigned to the region are being reduced, those officials said.<br />The redeployment includes hundreds of troops who are members of units that operate or support those systems. The move comes as the military plans a complete withdrawal from Afghanistan by this summer and after the U.S. last fall cut its force posture in Iraq by half—or 2,500 troops—because it said Iraqi forces could secure the country.<br />The latest reductions, which haven't been previously reported, began earlier this month, following a June 2 call in which Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin informed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of the changes, officials said. Most of the military hardware being removed is coming from Saudi Arabia, officials said.<br />The U.S. moved Patriot antimissile systems to Iraq after Iran in January 2020 fired missiles at the Al Asad base in western Iraq, where U.S. troops are stationed. The Iranian attack was a response to a U.S. drone attack that killed Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian military leader.</td>

More than 270 U.S. bishops were eligible to vote.<br />The bishops’ doctrinal committee will now proceed to draft a document on the Eucharist that will include a section on the conditions under which politicians may receive Communion. Some bishops want that section to state that politicians who support abortion rights must be denied the sacrament.<br />Proponents of the document originally planned to set forth a national policy on the matter, but scrapped that idea in deference to the Vatican, which warned last month that such a move would be divisive. Bishop Kevin Rhoades of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Ind., head of the doctrinal committee, has said that the document might instead include practical guidance for individual bishops dealing with politicians who support abortion rights. He also suggested that it might mention other activities—such as leadership of a white supremacist organization—that could disqualify one from receiving the sacrament.<br />Opponents of the document said it would inevitably be read as an attack on specific leaders including President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, both of whom are Catholic and support abortion rights.</td>

      <td>In the estate he gave his empress, the gardens were lavish. His life ended in a modest one he tilled himself.</td>
      <td>On June 25, 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte arrived at Malmaison, the late Empress Joséphine’s estate 7 miles west of Paris. His dream of holding on to the French throne had just shattered at Waterloo, costing the lives of tens of thousands. Five years earlier, he had divorced Joséphine because she hadn’t given him the heir his dynastic desires required. Now that she was dead, all he could think about was how much he missed her—how she used to walk under the trees she had planted, those cedars, cypresses and Japanese pagodas, how she would examine the flowers in her greenhouse or gather the roses she loved so much. The memory made Napoleon wince. “She was the most graceful woman I ever saw,” he told his stepdaughter Hortense. Too little, too late.<br />Joséphine, always “surrounded by colour and fragrance,” as the British historian Ruth Scurr’s beautiful new book describes her, was the gardener Napoleon never became. This is, indeed, how she appears in François Gérard’s 1801 portrait of her: languidly sunk into her sofa, a bouquet of freshly picked flowers by her side, her teeming garden behind her. Compared to Joséphine, Napoleon was at best a jardinier intermittent, an intermittent gardener, an epithet bestowed on him by a plaque installed on the small island of Île-d’Aix, where Napoleon is believed to have grafted an ash onto an elm (just as he, the native Corsican, had grafted himself onto native French stock).<br />It is an adjustment to think of Napoleon as a cultivator rather than as a conqueror, a planter rather than a planner. But such ambivalences are precisely Ms. Scurr’s métier: Her fast-paced biography of Robespierre, “Fatal Purity” (2006), accomplished the impossible—make the pinched embodiment of France’s Reign of Terror seem almost relatable. In “Napoleon: A Life Told in Gardens and Shadows,” a book so saturated with detail that the reader can hear the gravel crunching under her characters’ feet, Ms. Scurr now performs a similar feat for Napoleon. The mountain of biographies written about the “Little Corporal” must, at this point, be higher than the Alps he famously crossed in 1800, but her horticultural angle allows Ms. Scurr to tell the endlessly fascinating story of his life anew: not as a megalomaniac’s power-hungry ascent to temporary glory but as the constantly frustrated reaching for the plenitude and happiness that Joséphine’s found in her garden.<br />Napoleon’s botanical career, such as it was, began in military school in Brienne-le-Château, with a small plot he used to create an arbor so he could be by himself. It continued with attempts to salvage his father’s mulberry nursery on Corsica, and, as he cast his menacing shadow over much of Europe, culminated in a variety of designs for formal gardens at home and abroad, including a madcap scheme that would have turned the Roman Forum into a promenade. But even as Napoleon sought to reinvent himself as a modern amalgam of Caesar Augustus, Charlemagne and Alexander the Great, he kept finding himself sent back to islands, his fabulous empire shrunk to gardens of diminishing size and lushness. Napoleon’s last, scraggly garden was on Deadwood, aptly named, a rocky, mist-shrouded plateau on Saint Helena, one of the remotest islands in the South Atlantic.<br />Ms. Scurr’s intention is not to cleanse Napoleon’s contaminated legacy; we never forget the millions of mangled bodies he left on the battlefields of Europe, the mistresses he bullied, the cries of the men and women he re-enslaved. Yet, drawing on numerous accounts by contemporaries, the author successfully complicates our image of the man Tolstoy dubbed an “executioner of peoples.” Who knew, for example, that Napoleon, as a 16-year-old boy, barely out of military school, touting his math and artillery skills, sought to join the Comte de La Pérouse’s ill-fated expedition round the world? (What if . . .) Or that he, after his ignominious defeat at Waterloo, immersed himself in Alexander von Humboldt’s works, contemplating a new life as a naturalist-explorer? Like his military campaigns, Napoleon’s science was all about conquest and control, not about a deeper understanding of nature, which comes only from wondering about what one cannot, or doesn’t yet, know. Consider Napoleon’s meeting with the aging proto-evolutionist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who in his “Zoological Philosophy” (1809) had tried to untangle some of nature’s best-kept mysteries. Handing a copy of his new book to Napoleon, he was rewarded with the Emperor’s contempt: “What is that? Your absurd meteorology? . . . I only take it in consideration of your white hair.” Tears streamed down the old man’s face.</td>

      <td>To decide whether nationalism is good or bad for America, we first have to agree about what it is.</td>
      <td>On election night in 2016, the intellectual classes of Europe and North America were ready  to turn out books and think pieces on the inexorable advance of transnational progressivism. Instead they were obliged to write about a reinvigorated nationalism, and they were ill-prepared for it. I don’t know how many times over the past five years I’ve read breezy discussions of post-’16 politics that simply assumed racial bigotry and police-state thuggery to be necessary components of any sort of nationalism.<br />The subject was treated carefully and sympathetically from the right by Rich Lowry in “The Case for Nationalism” (2019). It was treated with similar care from the left by the journalist John B. Judis in “The Nationalist Revival” (2018). The latter work is now collected with two others by the same author in “The Politics of Our Time: Populism, Nationalism, Socialism” (Columbia Global Reports, 430 pages, $27.95). Mr. Judis begins with what should be, but among many allegedly smart commentators isn’t, the obvious point that  some nationalisms are healthy and some are pathological. “Abraham Lincoln and Benito Mussolini were ardent nationalists” is his terse summation.<br />Mr. Judis rejects the idea, tacitly accepted by many on today’s left, that transnational elites can be trusted to manage a globalized economy for the benefit of all. Accordingly he wants to “reclaim what is valid in nationalism . . . from both the cosmopolitan liberals who believe in a borderless world and from the rightwing populists who have coupled a concern for their nation’s workers with nativist screeds against outgroups and immigrants.”<br />Mr. Judis writes, as usual, with clarity and wit, and his knowledge of modern politics in Europe and North America is vast. As in his volume on populism, also collected here, he makes a strong economic case for the nationalist impulse and all but ignores cultural conflicts leading sensible people to vote for nationalist candidates. Put otherwise, he favors trade protections not because they are economically rational (I'm not sure he cares if they are) but because they bolster organized labor and foster social cohesion; and he regrets untrammeled immigration not because it changes the culture but because it exhausts the welfare state.<br />I remain unconvinced, however, that the rise of Donald Trump had primarily to do with economic circumstances. His candidacy was helped by blue-collar workers angered by closing factories and unchecked immigration, to be sure. But we have had anti-immigration and protectionist presidential candidates before, and they made little progress. Mr. Trump himself was one of those candidates in 2012, and his campaign, such as it was, fizzled early. He would have fizzled again in 2016 without the insane aggressions of cultural leftism: campus riots, militant political correctness, overt anti-Americanism in the media, transgender-bathrooms directives and all the rest. Liberals who interpret the 2016 election as a protest against economic globalization, “neoliberalism” and “post-industrial capitalism” may have a point, but they minimize the importance of Obama-era cultural radicalism—for the simple reason that they’re partial to it.</td>

      <td>Earlier this year, the Academy Award for best documentary feature went to “My Octopus Teacher,” which chronicled what filmmaker Craig Foster learned from his daily visits to an octopus off the coast of South Africa.<br />The film was beautifully made, but it also got the Oscar nod, one gathers, because it spoke deeply to our current cultural moment. At a time when various challenges threaten animal life around the globe, people seem more interested in gleaning insights from other species while they can. Stories about what animals can teach us abound these days, especially in book publishing. Recent surveys of the subject include Richard Louv’s “Our Wild Calling” and Caitlin O’Connell’s “Wild Rituals.” Personal memoirs of interspecies connection, such as Helen Macdonald’s “H Is for Hawk” and Marc Hamer’s “How to Catch a Mole,” provide intimate accounts of creatures few of us now experience up close.<br />Given those precedents, “Fox and I,” Catherine Raven’s story about her relationship with a wild red fox, is likely to find a receptive audience. But readers might also ask, given the well-trodden ground on this topic, whether there’s much new to say.<br />While not addressing the question directly, Ms. Raven, a former national park ranger who has a Ph.D. in biology, warns against glib generalizations when it comes to animals. The fox who visited within feet of her each day at her isolated homestead, a striking departure in a species generally known for its wariness, seemed a case in point, suggesting that foxes, like people, might encompass a good deal of variety. She quickly concedes that any assumption of kinship between foxes and humans can cause trouble for a scientist: “You don’t need much imagination to see that society has bulldozed a gorge between humans and wild, unboxed animals, and it’s far too wide and deep for anyone who isn’t foolhardy to risk the crossing. As for making yourself unpopular, you might as well show up to a university lecture wearing Christopher Robin shorts and white bobby socks as be accused of anthropomorphism.”<br />But for Ms. Raven, the greater risk seemed to be diminishing Fox, as her visitor came to be called, by reducing him to “data points.” Living in solitude after a troubled youth, she welcomed Fox’s visits each afternoon. Like Ms. Macdonald and Mr. Hamer, Ms. Raven had turned to nature as a salve for psychic wounds. She sporadically refers to her childhood within an abusive household, leaving when she was 15 and eventually securing work in the Park Service and advanced degrees. The author references her emotional scars with heartbreaking economy. “A long time ago,” Ms. Raven tells readers, “I had arrived at the prudent and logical conclusion that when your own parents don’t want you, no one else will.”</td>

      <td>A new exhibition shows how the ruling Medici family used artworks as propaganda in the 16h century.</td>
      <td>A bronze bust of Duke Cosimo I de’ Medici reigns over the first part of “The Medici: Portraits and Politics, 1512-1570,” a new exhibition opening June 26 at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. As befits a member of the family that dominated Florence’s culture and politics for centuries, the bust by Benvenuto Cellini is larger than life, showing the duke with an “almost frightening expression on his face,” says curator Keith Christiansen, who organized the exhibition.<br />Florence’s heyday as a European power came in the 15th century, when the Medicis made the city the capital of the Italian Renaissance, patronizing artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. In the period covered by the new show, its power was on the decline, as the armies of France and the Holy Roman Empire fought for control of Italy. In the 1520s, the city faced an 11-month military siege and two bouts of plague.<br />The Medicis continued to patronize some of the era’s greatest artists. The Met show includes Raphael’s 1518 portrait of Lorenzo de’ Medici, duke of Urbino, who ruled Florence in the 1510s. But it is dominated by slightly lesser stars—most remarkably Bronzino (1503-72), a butcher’s son who became one of Florence’s top painters, as well as Jacopo da Pontormo (1494-1557), Bronzino’s teacher, and Francesco Salviati (1510-63), famous for his frescoes and portraits. All three painters are associated in various degrees with Mannerism, a style that placed a premium on “art rather than nature,” says art historian Linda Wolk-Simon.<br />The exhibition emphasizes how the Medicis used art commissions as propaganda, making clear that Florence was still a power to reckon with. Cellini’s bronze bust of Cosimo (1546-47) is decorated with armor, lions’ heads and eagles—“imperial iconography,” as guest curator Carlo Falciani puts it. The bust stood for more than two centuries at a gate on Elba, an Italian island where Cosimo built fortifications. The long exposure to the elements hid one of the bust’s most striking aspects, eyes of silver that shoot a piercing gaze—now vivid again after a restoration.<br />Bronzino also painted Cosimo as a warrior in armor, and the Medicis ordered nearly 30 copies of the picture to send to powerful people in Italy and beyond. Raphael’s portrait of Lorenzo, by contrast, emphasizes the ruler’s wealth, showing him in “shimmering silk, crisp linen, heavy cut velvet, and wispy fur,” as the catalog puts it—a costume that Ms. Wolk-Simon calls “over the top.” This was a different sort of propaganda, meant to present Lorenzo as a suitable match for a distant cousin of the French king. The portrait went to France ahead of the groom.</td>

      <td>The great writer coped with pain and loss by getting back to work, not by withdrawing into ‘self-care.’</td>
      <td>Since the 19th century, Americans have looked to Ralph Waldo Emerson for wisdom on many subjects, from education to religion to politics. Today, surrounded by political storms and the sorrow and wreckage of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Emerson we need most is the prophet of resilience. Emerson’s ideas about resilience stand in potent contrast to our current cultural consensus on how to deal with suffering and loss. Instead of “self-care” and “healing,” he offers an aggressive affirmation of the will and of work.<br />Life compelled Emerson to become something of an expert on resilience. As a young man he lost the love of his life, his wife Ellen, to tuberculosis when she was just 19. His oldest son, Waldo—a joyful child who seemed to concentrate in himself what was most uninhibitedly life-loving in his father—died of scarlet fever when he was 5 years old.<br />Emerson’s remedy for sorrow, grief and depression was not to stay still. Don’t hold on to your pain and wait for it to work itself through—instead, get up and do something. Write your speech, compose your music, start your business or expand it; go at it, whatever it might be. In his essay “Self-Reliance,” he puts it this way: “Life only avails not the having lived. Power ceases in the instant of repose, it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim.”<br />In the essay “Power,” Emerson writes that we carefully watch children to see if they possess “the recuperative force.” Those who instinctively retire to their rooms in sorrow when they’re slighted, miss the prize or lose the game will be at a serious disadvantage in adult life. “But,” Emerson continues, “if they have the buoyancy and resistance that preoccupies them with new interest in the new moment,—the wounds cicatrize, and the fiber is the tougher for the hurt.”<br />When Waldo died, Emerson needed that kind of buoyancy and resistance to overcome the greatest sadness of his life. Writing in his journal two days after his son’s death, he seems overwhelmed by grief: “The morning of Friday I awoke at 3 o’clock, & every cock in every barnyard was shrilling with the most unnecessary noise. The sun went up the morning sky with all his light, but the landscape was dishonored by this loss. For this boy in whose remembrance I have slept & awaked so oft, decorated for me the morning star, & the evening cloud.”</td>

      <td>Brussels court ruling stems from EU accusations over delays of vaccines the company developed with Oxford University</td>
      <td>A Brussels court ruled that  AstraZeneca  PLC isn’t required to accelerate deliveries of its Covid-19 vaccine to the European Union and isn’t on the hook for big fines the bloc had sought to impose in a lawsuit over delivery delays.<br />Early this year, AstraZeneca disclosed significant manufacturing shortfalls of the vaccine and warned the EU that it wouldn’t be able to meet delivery commitments. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, took the company to court, asking a judge to force the company to deliver 120 million doses by the end of June, or pay 10 euros, or about $12 a day, for each dose it failed to deliver—representing potential fines in the hundreds of millions of euros.<br />The Belgian court, ruling on the lawsuit Friday, ordered AstraZeneca to deliver a total of just 80.2 million doses by September, a low hurdle since AstraZeneca has already delivered 70 million doses. AstraZeneca said it would meet the September target this month.<br />Both sides claimed victory. AstraZeneca said the court’s decision supported its claim that production problems outside its control hampered deliveries. The EU said the decision—while not forcing the company to expedite doses or face fines—showed AstraZeneca was in breach of its contract. Lawyers for the European Commission also said AstraZeneca would have fallen further behind in deliveries if it hadn’t taken legal action.<br />The battle between the EU and AstraZeneca has been going since January, when the company first warned it wouldn’t meet supply targets. At that time, Europe was depending heavily on the shot, developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, as it tried to jump-start a troubled vaccination launch.</td>

      <td>Covid restrictions seem less onerous from the standpoint of ‘expressive individualism,’ which defines the self in terms of ‘its will and not its body.’</td>
      <td>South Bend, Ind.<br />A marvelous review in these pages last November inspired me to read a new book by O. Carter Snead, “What It Means to Be Human: The Case for the Body in Human Bioethics.” It was published by Harvard University Press on Oct. 13. Covid-19 had begun its transformation of American life a few months before, and of course the book made no mention of it.<br />Yet Mr. Snead’s volume helped explain the bizarre and at times perverse response of prosperous Western nations to the pandemic: the long discontinuation of economic life, the belief that pixelated screens can facilitate human relationships, the prohibitions on ordinary social interactions, the fetishization of masks. These policies and practices weren’t handed down from the ether by Reason and Science but bore the weight of contemporary assumptions about—to borrow Mr. Snead’s title—what it means to be human.<br />His book isn’t about public health but “public bioethics”—the effort to make humane laws and rules for biotechnology and medical care. Mr. Snead’s premise and theme is that humans are embodied creatures, not mere wills and intellects. That premise stands in contrast with the dominant modern worldview, which he calls “expressive individualism”: the belief that the human self “is not defined by its attachments or networks of relations, but rather by its capacity to choose a future pathway that is revealed by the investigation of its own inner depths of sentiment. . . . Because this self is defined by its capacity to choose, it is associated fundamentally with its will and not its body.”<br />Mr. Snead is a law professor at Notre Dame and director of its Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture. On a recent trip to the Midwest, I drove to South Bend to ask what the pandemic year has revealed about our understanding of humanness.</td>

      <td>Arizona, Michigan and Texas are showing how to create resilient systems for government retirees.</td>
      <td>State and municipal debt has tripled since 2000, with unfunded public pension liabilities mostly to blame. After 20 years of inadequate funding policies, failure to meet overly optimistic investment return targets, and other factors, state and local government pension systems are now $1.5 trillion in debt.<br />That debt is ultimately borne by taxpayers, and like any debt, when unfunded pension liabilities rise, so do the costs of servicing it. As pension debt payments start to siphon money away from other government priorities, such as education and infrastructure, some lawmakers are now pushing for much-needed reforms.<br />In Texas, the state Legislature passed a major pension reform that tackles the Employees Retirement System of Texas’ nearly $15 billion in pension debt. The ERS serves more than 300,000 current and retired Texas government workers. But driven largely by rosy investment-return assumptions and a history of underfunding by the state, the system’s unfunded liabilities have skyrocketed. The ERS’s consulting actuary says the plan will be insolvent by 2061 even if it meets its lofty long-term investment return goals, and as early as 2047 if it doesn’t.<br />The reform legislation commits Texas to paying the bill for retirement benefits promised to workers by shifting the ERS to actuarially based funding and a fixed payoff schedule. The new law also enters all future employees into a new low-risk “cash balance” retirement plan that provides a guaranteed minimum 4% return on investment along with the portability of a 401(k). In short, the reforms would enable Texas to keep the promises made to current and retired workers but would stop making unsustainable pension promises to workers in the future.<br />The pension reform bill will become law this weekend if Gov. Greg Abbott doesn’t veto it, which he hasn’t indicated he will do. Texas will then join a growing list of states—including Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Colorado—that have created or expanded retirement plans that reduce financial risks for governments and can help avoid burdening future taxpayers with more unfunded liabilities.</td>

      <td>The pandemic made sloths of many of us. To shake off the inertia—and really get your heart pumping—book a vacation to a working cattle ranch and prepare to pitch in.</td>
      <td>ON A RECENT Thursday at Chico Basin, an 87,000-acre cattle ranch near Colorado Springs, Colo., I sat secure in my saddle atop a palomino horse named Butters, staring down on organized chaos. Dozens of heifers and calves passed by in a stream of horns, pounding hooves and glossy, reddish backs. They were following the lead of a big, jet-black cow, christened the Widowmaker, as we herded her to a mid-pasture pen. When she suddenly darted off toward open range, Butters and I sprinted to block her escape, then ran to help deter other cows trying to run past the pen gate.<br />This isn’t everyone’s idea of a vacation. But after my first-ever wrangling session, I felt thoroughly exhilarated. Better yet, I forgot all about Covid, emails piling up in my inbox and the rest of my everyday life. For one vigorous, immensely gratifying day, all I cared about was Butters and a herd of cattle.<br />The concept of the dude ranch first came about in the late 1800s. These tourist resorts introduced Easterners to a romanticized version of life in the scenic, undeveloped West. (At the time, “dude” was slang for an urban dandy.) Today they still provide attractive, often luxurious vacation options—socially distant refuges, in naturally soothing settings, whose popularity unsurprisingly spiked during the pandemic. But the experience at many of these built-for-tourist operations usually reflects few of the realities of ranch life. Chico Basin Ranch is emphatically not a dude ranch, but rather one of a small number of working ranches in the U.S. that invite a few paying guests to join the workdays. That can mean waking up at dawn, sharing homemade meals with ranch staff and spending hours on labor-intensive tasks, from tending vegetable gardens and feeding livestock to repairing fences and herding, even branding, cattle. In exchange, industrious visitors get a physically challenging getaway and a chance to participate in a great American tradition—minus the artifice of a deluxe dude ranch.<br />During my first day at Chico Basin, I didn’t just learn how to herd cattle but also how grazing rotations are modeled on the ways wildlife naturally behaves (leaving grasslands healthy and naturally resilient), why Chico’s managers prefers mostly smaller Beefmaster breed cows (which adapt well to drought and both hot and cold climates) and why they don’t dehorn their cattle the way most ranchers do (so the mothers can efficiently defend their calves from predators).<br />I also learned that Chico Basin’s open grasslands are, unexpectedly, a  refuge for more than 300 species of migratory songbirds and nesting birds. In between ranch work—or instead of them; guests are under no obligation to lift a finger—visitors can birdwatch, swim or fish in any one of four lakes, go horseback riding or simply hang out and enjoy the scenery. In late spring, when I visited, wildflowers dotted the verdant grassland. The ranch can welcome up to six guests in a historic adobe bunkhouse, which includes two rooms and a shared bath. During my stay, I shared the ranch with only two other guests, including Erika Broyles, an Air Force veteran from Louisiana and mother of three young children. An avid equestrian, she came to Chico Basin on a solo vacation, a gift from her husband. “I’ve been following them on Instagram for a long time, I love what they do here,” she told me, referring to the ranch’s focus on conservation. The trip, initially postponed by the pandemic, became a welcome antidote to months under lockdown at home, she said.</td>

That attempt at an injunction came after the Court of Arbitration for Sport initially rejected her appeal of her failed doping test.<br />“The court found that because the CAS has not released its reasoning for the decision they can’t know whether I am likely to succeed in an appeal,” Houlihan wrote in the statement. She added, “This ruling means that my goal of making another Olympic team is over for now. I can’t begin to find the words to express how disheartening this is. It absolutely breaks my heart to have my dreams and career taken away for something I did not do.”<br />She said she would continue her appeal to the Swiss tribunal once CAS issued its full decision. “I am told that appeals of this kind are difficult to win, but I continue to believe that the truth will prevail,” she wrote.</td>

      <td>STICK WITH ME. I’ll get to the soufflés. I’ve been thinking about a scene in “Mad Men” where the lead character, Don Draper, goes to watch his daughter in a school maypole performance. I’m not sure whether it was in the script or an actor’s choice, but the next moments capture desire and longing so evocatively. When Don (Jon Hamm) becomes aware of the beautiful, barefoot teacher dancing with her students, his gaze remains fixed on her. Suited up and hidden behind aviator sunglasses, Don imperceptibly reaches to caress the grass beneath his chair.<br />I guess I’m telling you this because over the last year, in lockdown, I often felt like Don. Stuck. Missing carefree moments and everyday pleasures that take me by surprise. I don’t have a maypole in my backyard, and I’m guessing you don’t either. So instead, I’ve been getting my hands in the dirt by tending to the nasturtiums I planted (that just keep growing all winter long in California, where I live), and baking them into soufflés. It’s not exactly running my fingers through warm blades of grass, but it’s helped.<br />I make different soufflés depending on the day and what’s on hand, but in the savory recipe pictured here front and center, salty feta, nutty Gruyère and sharp Parmesan work in tandem with the peppery nasturtium to create vibrancy. I pick the dew-kissed nasturtium leaves in the morning to make individual soufflés for breakfast.<br />When I want a sweet soufflé, I often jump the backyard fence (or make my husband do it) to get into the abandoned lot next door and pick the most aromatic lemons I’ve ever had. An excess of this exemplary citrus led me to start baking the luscious lemon soufflé saucy pudding at right.<br />The process of making a soufflé is not nearly as stressful as we’ve been led to believe. Follow a few bedrock tips, and you’ll be fine. Gently fold and cut whisked egg whites into the béchamel mixture or batter by adding the egg whites a third at a time. Use a large spatula to lift the batter from the bottom of the bowl and fold it over into the whites. Rotate the bowl continuously, slicing through the center of the batter often. Don’t stir or you will knock all the air out of the egg whites—the air that helps the soufflé rise. The first third loosens the mixture. Repeat with the remaining two thirds until you have a lovely, airy batter.</td>

The bipartisan legislation was signed into law by President Biden on June 17, giving Juneteenth the same status as Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day and other federal holidays.<br />Celebrated for decades through family gatherings and events such as parades and public readings of the Emancipation Proclamation, the holiday received more national attention in recent years—in particular after the global protests sparked in 2020 by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Rayshard Brooks, as well as a national conversation to rethink policing in America. Amid calls for racial equity, more companies, including  Nike Inc.,   Twitter Inc.  and  Spotify Technology SA,  moved to observe the holiday.<br />The holiday, also known as Emancipation Day, Black Independence Day or Jubilee Day, recognizes the date when news of emancipation finally reached Galveston, on June 19, 1865.<br />Nearly two months after the end of the Civil War, Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger, along with more than 1,800 federal troops, arrived to take control of the state, confirming the freedom of the last remaining slaves in the deepest parts of the South.</td>

      <td>Meme cash lets AMC go ‘on the offensive’ while other chains are shopping, but final impact unclear</td>
      <td>Far from killing the movie-exhibition industry, the pandemic may end up helping the big theater chains get even bigger.<br />Flush with money from sales of its soaring meme stock,  AMC  Entertainment has clearly indicated it is shopping around. When the company landed a deal on June 1 to sell about $231 million worth of shares to Mudrick Capital, Chief Executive Adam Aron proclaimed that it is time for the largest theater operator in the U.S. to “go on the offense again.”<br />He noted at the time that the company was in discussions with multiple landlords to take over some theaters formerly operated by ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific Theatres.<br />That deal may be near done. The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that AMC was nearing a deal for “key” Pacific theaters in the area. Two of the theaters were even listed on AMC’s site and ticketing app for part of the day before being taken down, the paper reported. They are unlikely to be the last, considering AMC’s acquisitive history and now bulging coffers.<br />Chief Financial Officer Sean Goodman told a Credit Suisse investment conference this week that the company will end June “in the ballpark” of about $1.8 billion in cash, according to the broker’s report of the conference. AMC had about $308 million on its balance sheet at the end of 2020.</td>

It expects to take a pretax loss of $2.3 billion on the sale, plus a further $700 million goodwill write-down.<br />Two decades ago, HSBC paid $10.6 billion to acquire Credit Commercial de France, as part of a broad growth strategy to expand its footprint to economies large and small around the world.<br />Its sale reflects the dire straits of European banks, with slow growth, negative interest rates and regulatory and political obstacles to consolidation.</td>

      <td>The need for higher returns can breed desperation for anyone with a portfolio—large or small</td>
      <td>At first glance, the Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System, one of the largest pension plans in the U.S., doesn’t sound anything like you or me. It commands $66 billion in net assets, spent $515 million last year on management fees, and has more than 40% of its net assets in exclusive investments like buyout, venture-capital and hedge funds.<br />Yet, at the most basic level, this gigantic retirement plan is just like you and me: It is struggling to raise returns in a low-interest-rate world.<br />That can breed desperation, and wishful thinking, for anyone with a portfolio large or small.<br />“The challenge we all face as investors is that the collapse in interest rates makes achieving historical rates of return very difficult,” says John Skjervem, chief executive of Alan Biller and Associates, an institutional investment consulting firm in Menlo Park, Calif. When cash and bonds yield close to zero, “stacking the traditional assets on top of that isn’t enough.”<br />For its part, the Pennsylvania school pension fund, also known as PSERS, for years has pumped billions into hedge funds and private equity. Those strategies purport to be able to thrive even when public markets lag. The giant fund had less than 25% of its assets in publicly traded stocks at last year’s end, even after some of the biggest bull markets in history.</td>

      <td>Richard Ernst’s parents worried about him. By age 3, he still wasn’t talking intelligibly in the Swiss German dialect spoken at the family home in Winterthur, Switzerland.<br />His language skills finally developed, and he showed promise playing the cello. Then, around age 13, he made a discovery in the family’s attic: A box of chemicals left by a late uncle. He began doing experiments and reading anything he could find about chemistry, an obsession that led to a career.<br />Dr. Ernst won the 1991 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his contributions in nuclear magnetic resonance, the technology best known today for its use by doctors in MRI scanners, allowing detailed views of the body’s interior. The technology also has applications in analyzing complicated molecules and the ways in which they interact with one another. It provides tools to develop drugs and vaccines or determine the molecular makeup of foods and other items. It can even be used to determine the origins of the olives used to make a particular batch of olive oil.<br />Dr. Ernst, who died June 4 at the age of 87, built on earlier work by scientists including Isidor Isaac Rabi, Felix Bloch and Edward Mills Purcell. The technology involves manipulating subatomic particles by exposing them to magnetic fields and radio waves. The particles’ movements in response to these stimuli produce radio waves that can be analyzed to reveal the structures of molecules and their motions.<br />In the late 1950s, when Dr. Ernst was introduced to early magnetic-resonance devices, they were too slow to be of much practical use. With an American colleague, Weston Anderson, in the 1960s he found that the use of short, intense radio pulses could provide much more detailed information about molecules. Dr. Ernst also applied a mathematical method, known as a Fourier transform, for rapid analysis of the subatomic wobbles set off by those pulses.</td>

      <td>‘Your character seems so real’ might be the ultimate compliment for a novelist—or a perfect nightmare.</td>
      <td>Gerald Andersen, the 61-year-old writer at the heart of Laura Lippman’s psychological thriller “Dream Girl” (Morrow, 310 pages, $28.99), has earned a rare and enviable success. Years ago, he published a novel, also named “Dream Girl,” that “ticked all the boxes and achieved that rare literary grand slam of prestige, sales, film rights, and zeitgeist.” Its perpetual royalties have bought him a duplex apartment in an ultra-modern building in his native Baltimore, as well as the freedom to live as he chooses (single, now, after three wives) and write only what he wants.<br />Not everyone is happy with what this self-centered author has achieved. Many people, he senses, “have been waiting a long time for Gerald Andersen to have a comeuppance.” His fall from grace starts with a literal stumble down his apartment’s floating staircase. Bedridden afterward, dependent on his young assistant and an indifferent nurse, Gerry starts receiving wee-hours phone calls from a woman insisting she is “Aubrey,” the heroine of his career-making book.<br />What does “Aubrey,” the supposed inspiration of Gerry’s most lucrative fiction, want? Lots of money—or she’ll tell the world Gerry’s best-kept secrets. But Gerry prides himself on being a good guy: “His conscience is clear. Clearish.” Yet his memory, now addled by medication, is spotty. Has he done some terrible thing he can no longer recall? Flashbacks revisit key episodes from Gerry’s past, times he’s behaved less than admirably.<br />“Aubrey” escalates her vexing activities, tweeting intimate gossip about Gerry. The author seeks help from a local private investigator: Ms. Lippman’s series detective Tess Monaghan, a reporter turned sleuth who made her first appearance in 1997’s “Baltimore Blues.” Straight-talking Tess turns the case down: “Obviously, the relationship between a PI and a client never works if the client lies to the investigator. But over the years, I’ve learned it also doesn’t work if the client is lying to himself.”<br />Eventually, Gerry is forced to deal with the aftermath of a fatal event that can’t be dismissed as a hallucination. The gifted Ms. Lippman, in this tale of a talented cad who more or less gets what he deserves, shifts between passages hard-boiled and satirical. “Dream Girl” offers a healthy dose of suspense and wittily skewers literary life. Gerry’s self-regard hasn’t instilled much empathy in those he pays to help him. He asks the nurse whom he’s taken into his confidence what he should do next. “You’re the writer,” she says. “Make something up.”</td>

      <td>A holiday offers time for peaceful reflection—or just a food fight with the kids</td>
      <td>Father’s Day is nearly here, and these two children who live in my home keep asking me what I would like to do for the holiday, because, apparently, I am their father. That’s what they’re saying, at least. They have offered to serve me breakfast in bed, “a day of relaxation,” as if two small children are constitutionally capable of offering that, and they’ve even asked me if I’d like a “special gift.”<br />I said sure, Your father would like a 1970 Ford Bronco, in reef aqua, low mileage, original interior, let’s see what you can do. The kids seem perplexed. They’re 8 and 6. I’m not sure if they’ve got the scratch.<br />It’s the thought that counts, however, even if those vintage Broncos are pretty sweet. I’m easy. I’m not interested in inflating Father’s Day into some kind of narcissistic tribute—I’m not one of those needy fathers who has to have marble statues of himself both inside and outside the house, or must slurp cheap Father’s Day champagne from a “No. 1 DAD” mug. Honestly, I’m not No. 1 DAD material. I’m more like a No. 11,119 DAD. Some days I might not even squeak into the Top 50,000.<br />Parenting, of course, is a low rumble of insecurity—you’re never quite sure how you’re doing and probably never will, at least until your kids grow up and write memoirs. I am trying, I care, I love them, I’m teaching them the important stuff—respect others, be truthful with your word, always split aces and 8s, never eat mini meatballs with your hands—but I’m only human. I occasionally eat mini meatballs with my hands. I’m not exactly a role model here.<br />What’s become clear to this father, over time, is that even when you try to cut your own path as a parent and trailblaze a new way, eventually, whether you like it or not, nature and nurture take over, and you simply turn into your own father. It’s an unavoidable metamorphosis. I loved my late father, but I wanted to parent a bit differently than he did, and yet more and more, I find myself mimicking things he used to do. I read aloud newspaper articles about obscure scientific discoveries; I complain about the traffic on family trips I’ve yet to take; and I tell my kids, with no factual basis, that Father’s Day is a holiday created by the golf and necktie industries. I have become my father, pretty much. The circle is complete.</td>

      <td>Selected by Barney White-Spunner, the author, most recently, of ‘Berlin: The Story of a City.’</td>
      <td>By Christopher Isherwood (1945)<br />1. The 1920s are sometimes described as Berlin’s golden age. It’s hard to see why. For most Berliners it was a time of poverty, hardship and loss sandwiched between two devastating wars. The decade did, though, produce some of Berlin’s most powerful literature, writers like Alfred Döblin, Bertolt Brecht, Georg Grosz, Erich Kästner, and Heinrich and Thomas Mann. But the writer who perhaps best captures the era is Christopher Isherwood, the British novelist who lived and worked in Berlin as the Nazis came to power. Isherwood, a homosexual who found that he was unable to live as he chose in London, wrote two novellas about his time in Berlin that are as witty and filled with spirit as they are, ultimately, sad. It was these works that provided the inspiration for the musical “Cabaret.”<br />By Walter Benjamin (ca. 1938)<br />Translated by Howard Eiland<br />2. Berlin has long had a thriving Jewish community. Some of the earliest graves found in the city are those of Jews who lived in the mid-13th century. Despite periodic vicious persecutions, Jews were, by 1900, well assimilated into Berlin society. Great dynasties like the Liebermanns, Mendelssohns and Rathenaus dominated industry and the arts. Walter Benjamin’s charming and evocative memoir portrays his comfortable and secure childhood in a rich Jewish family in west Berlin. At once moving and haunting, it was written in the 1930s as the Nazis were destroying the very world Benjamin so lovingly describes. Published posthumously, it remains one of the most evocative of Berlin books.</td>

      <td>St. Louis Fed President questions continued mortgage-bond purchases amid robust housing market</td>
      <td>The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said the economy is seeing more inflation than he and his colleagues had expected, and noted that while there is substantial uncertainty about the outlook, it could lead to a rate increase next year.<br />Speaking Friday on CNBC, Mr. Bullard said that when he submitted forecasts at this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, “I put us starting in late 2022” with the first move up from what are now near-zero short-term interest rates.<br />At the FOMC meeting earlier this week, central bankers opened the door to the option of paring back some of the massive stimulus they have been providing the economy since the pandemic last year. Officials projected a stronger economic outlook with notably more inflation this year, and penciled in two rate increases next year, compared with expectations of no change in their interest-rate target at the March policy meeting.<br />“The inflationary impulse, I think, is more intense than we were expecting,” Mr. Bullard said. “You could see even some upside risks to the inflation forecast, but that’s okay” given that the central bank had hoped to get inflation back up over 2% for a time to make up for extended periods of falling short of that goal, he said. At the Fed meeting, officials projected 3.4% inflation this year, up from the 2.4% forecast made in March.<br />Mr. Bullard also noted that Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door on Wednesday to a central bank debate on paring back on bond-buying stimulus efforts. The Fed is currently buying $80 billion per month in Treasury bonds and $40 billion per month in mortgage bonds to help smooth markets and provide stimulus beyond what its near-zero short-term rate target can deliver.</td>

      <td>In the world of Chirri & Chirra, a little rain can’t stop the magic.</td>
      <td>The arrival of a new “Chirri & Chirra” book is always a treat for those of us fond of deliciously illustrated tableaux in the books we read with children. Through six previous adventures, Kaya Doi’s pink-cheeked, bob-haired characters have traveled by bicycle under the ground, under the sea and through the seasons, and now they’re off on a damp and magical escapade in “Chirri & Chirra: The Rainy Day” (Enchanted Lion, 32 pages, $16.95), translated from the Japanese by David Boyd.<br />The joy of these books lies in the pure enchantment that they offer to children ages 2-8. There is no snark, no cynicism, no deceit or retribution in Chirri and Chirra’s world. All is kindness, softness, curiosity and good fortune. The two adventurers are forever coming upon dear little cafes and hotels run by friendly animals; each book finds them tucking into exquisite and surprising dainties.<br />On this excursion, for instance, Chirri and Chirra take refreshment at a tiny woodland shop that’s only open on rainy days. “Chirri orders the chrysanthemum tea with lemon marmalade and Chirra orders the peppermint tea with green-apple syrup. Their drinks come with bowls of frozen raindrop candy,” we read, devouring these delicacies with our eyes. When the friends—or siblings, it’s not clear—pedal away again, they feel a bit floaty and soon discover that they’re cycling above the rain, which falls beneath their wheels like a pretty blue curtain. How to get down at the end of the day? By blowing bubbles after eating “ripe and sparkling” gumdrops, of course. What did you expect?<br />It’s fun to read picture books with built-in sound effects. For parents, it keeps things playful; for toddlers, it’s gratifying to be able to chime in. “What Does Little Crocodile Say?” (Tundra, 40 pages, $17.99), written and illustrated by Eva Montanari, offers lots of scope for amusing noises. From the moment a little crocodile wakes up to the “ring ring” of an alarm clock, his day is full of sounds. At first, the mood is happy: “The tickle goes tee-hee. The water goes splash. The zipper goes zzzt.” But a note of worry enters the story as the door goes “wump” behind the little crocodile and his mother takes him to what appears to be the first day of preschool.<br />As readers ages 2-5 will see in Ms. Montanari’s simple and expressive colored-pencil drawings, by the time mother and child reach the classroom, the little croc’s apprehension is so overwhelming that he has to be carried. Fortunately, in the way of picture books about the terrors and joys of starting school, the mood improves. During the reading hour, “the book goes once upon a time,” and during snack time “the food goes nom nom nom.” By the end of the day, the little crocodile is so happy that he covers his mother with kisses: “Muah muah muah!”</td>

Long lines have emerged as airlines, airports and the Transportation Security Administration scramble to hire staff and accommodate the influx of passengers.<br />Airline and airport executives say they anticipated that vaccines and easing restrictions would stoke renewed appetite for travel, but the speed and magnitude of the resurgence has exceeded their expectations. Even without the return of most business and international travel, the number of people passing through U.S. airports has surpassed two million on some days, a threshold last reached in March 2020. July 4—typically the peak of the summer travel season—is looming.<br />U.S. carriers are scheduled to fly more than 88 million seats in July, a 32% increase from April. That is still well short of 2019, but airlines are adding capacity much more quickly than they have in the past. Over the same four-month period in 2019, airlines increased the number of seats in the market by just 9% to meet summer demand, according to Cirium, an aviation-data provider.<br />Demand has quickly absorbed the extra seats. Planes are 83% full on average, and even more packed during heavily busy periods. Last year airlines offered steep discounts and deals. Now airfare is on the rise. The Labor Department reported last week that its airfare index rose 7% in May after gaining 10.2% in April. Carriers say leisure fares are on track to meet or exceed 2019 levels this summer.</td>

Nuclear negotiations between the two countries have been stalled since 2019.<br />Administration officials reached out to Pyongyang early in Mr. Biden’s presidency to gauge the possibility of resuming negotiations. The U.S. leader has said he is open to diplomacy with North Korea, but Mr. Kim’s regime hadn’t yet responded in a meaningful way, U.S. officials have said.<br />“It had seemed like North Korea was keeping the door to diplomacy very close to shut,” said Wi Sung-lac, a former nuclear envoy for Seoul who has participated in negotiations with the Kim regime. “It now looks like the North Koreans have slightly opened the door, though not by a lot.”<br />The Biden administration conducted a policy review on North Korea, which it said in April had been completed. Since then, U.S. officials have said they would continue pressuring Mr. Kim to give up his entire nuclear arsenal, but wouldn’t seek a grand bargain as former President Donald Trump had.</td>

      <td>France midfielder N’Golo Kanté has defied soccer orthodoxy to become one of the most influential players in the game</td>
      <td>SURESNES, France—In the days before French midfielder N’Golo Kanté dominated World Cup matches and Champions League finals, his youth coach would drive him around the Paris suburbs trying to show off a subtle, yet crucial point about his game.<br />Kanté looks small, he would tell bigger clubs on the hunt for talent, but believe me, he’s not too small to be useful. It was a tough case to make considering Kanté is 5-foot-6 on a good day.<br />“Today he’s listed at 5-6,” said Pierre Ville, the former technical director here at JS Suresnes. “I’m not convinced he’s even that tall.”<br />A decade later, Kanté hasn’t grown, but his stature in world soccer is enormous and he is a key part of France’s bid to win the European Championship this summer.<br />At 30, he has won almost every other piece of hardware available: the World Cup, the Premier League, the FA Cup, the Europa League, and the Champions League. He was an essential piece of Leicester City’s 5,000-to-1 run to the English title in 2016. And last month, he was voted man of the match as Chelsea became European club champion.</td>
