      <td>Can the party incorporate some of his political positions while moving past his poisonous style?</td>
      <td>What is to become of the Republican Party? It will either break up or hold together. If the latter, it will require time to work through divisions; there will be state fights and losses as the party stumbles through cycle to cycle. But in time one side or general tendency will win and define the party. Splits get resolved when somebody wins big and nationally. Eisenhower’s landslides in 1952 and ’56 announced to the party that it was moderate. Reagan’s in 1980 and ’84 revealed it was conservative. The different factions get the message and follow the winner like metal filings to a magnet.<br />The future, according to this space, is and should be economically populist and socially conservative.<br />The future GOP, and the current one for that matter, is a party of conservatism with important Trumpian inflections. The great outstanding question: Will those inflections be those of attitude—wildness, garish personalities and conspiracy-mindedness? If so, the party will often lose. Or will the inflections be those of actual policy, in which case they will often win?<br />In terms of policy the future GOP will be more Trumpian, meaning more populist and nationalist. High spending will continue (and will not much be acknowledged!) but it will be high spending with a more conservative bent—more for cops, for instance. The party will be preoccupied neither by the capital-gains tax nor by what’s good for corporations. It won’t cut entitlements.<br />Skepticism about great international crusades will continue. The modern GOP has been internationalist and interventionist. (The Democrats too.) The future GOP will be internationalist up to a point—the world has a way of forcing you to think about it; trade deals need to be made. But it won’t be like it was, all flags unfurled.</td>

      <td>What did Labor Secretary Marty Walsh know about a union chief charged with sexually abusing children?</td>
      <td>Bostonians were shocked last summer when the former chief of the Boston police union, Patrick Rose, was arrested on 33 counts of sexually abusing children. The dismay has grown as it’s become clear that Mr. Rose’s behavior was known for years and that officials helped to keep it secret. That may have included Marty Walsh, the former union chief, former mayor of Boston and now U.S. secretary of Labor.<br />Mr. Rose served 24 years in the Boston Police Department before his arrest, including three years as the head of the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association. In 1995 he was criminally charged with sexually abusing a child and placed on administrative duty. The Boston Globe reports that prosecutors in 1996 dropped the charge when the accuser “recanted his story under pressure from Rose.”<br />Yet a subsequent internal affairs investigation that same year concluded that the charge “was sustained.” The Globe reports that state child welfare investigators also looked into the allegation and found “reasonable cause to believe” a child was abused.<br />It isn’t clear how the police department responded to those findings. But in 1997 an attorney for the police union sent a letter to the police commissioner complaining that Mr. Rose had been restricted to administrative duty for two years and threatened to file a grievance. Mr. Rose was then reinstated as a patrol officer and allowed contact with children. According to prosecutors, he went on to sexually abuse at least five more minors, including when he was union president from 2014-2017. Mr. Rose has pleaded not guilty.<br />Mr. Rose will get his day in court, but Mr. Walsh’s role needs more attention. Following Mr. Rose’s arrest last summer, the Globe filed requests for the officer’s internal affairs file, which included details of the 1995 charge, internal investigation and union response. The Walsh administration refused to release the file, saying the records could not be redacted in a way that would satisfy privacy concerns.</td>

      <td>The teachers union chief finally says schools can open—next fall.</td>
      <td>American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten on Thursday hopped onto the caboose that has already left the station. “There is no doubt: Schools must be open. In person. Five days a week,” the teachers’ union chief declared in a speech.<br />That’s nice of her to say now that nearly all school districts have announced plans to return to in-person learning five days a week next fall amid growing pressure from parents. Countless studies have shown that schools aren’t major causes of Covid spread, and younger children are unlikely to transmit the virus.<br />On the other hand, the learning losses from a year of virtual education have been significant, especially for lower-income children. School shutdowns and irregular schedules have also kept many mothers out of work.<br />Ms. Weingarten and her union friends who run big city districts have held children and parents hostage to obtain more money from Washington for higher salaries and pensions. The $1.9 trillion spending bill that Democrats passed in March includes $129 billion for K-12 schools, which was on top of the $13.2 billion allocated in last spring’s Cares Act and the $54.3 billion in the December Covid bill.<br />Schools haven’t had to reopen to receive any of the extra cash. The Congressional Budget Office projected that only $6 billion of the $129 billion would be spent in fiscal year 2021. Most of the booty won’t be spent until 2023 or later, and some not until 2028. Talk about a gift that keeps on giving.</td>

      <td>Missile defense again shows its military and diplomatic benefits.</td>
      <td>We’ve heard since the 1980s that missile defenses are a waste of money, but Israel keeps proving their value on the modern battlefield. The latest example is the success of Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defense system in reducing casualties and damage from rocket attacks.<br />A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces says that Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Iran-backed terrorist groups based in Gaza, had fired some 1,700 rockets against Israeli cities this week as of Thursday evening. But the defining image of the conflict so far isn’t Israeli infantry maneuvering into enemy territory. Instead it’s the night sky over Tel Aviv that lights up as batteries of Iron Dome missiles, using radar and sophisticated computer systems, track and shoot down 90% of the incoming weapons.<br />Israel and the U.S. have worked on missile-defense systems for decades, but most efforts have focused on shooting down long-range missiles. The Iron Dome is tailored to defend a small territory with threats concentrated along Israel’s borders. An Israeli firm, Rafael, developed the technology in the 2000s, and in the 2010s the U.S. pitched in for deployment and to acquire some of the systems. In 2020 the American firm Raytheon announced a partnership with Rafael to build Iron Dome in the U.S.<br />Iron Dome saves Israeli lives and property, but it also changes the propaganda calculus for Israel’s adversaries. The high rate of missile interceptions gives Israel’s leaders more flexibility in how they respond to the attacks.<br />Fewer Israeli casualties means there’s less political pressure for a full-scale invasion of Gaza or for indiscriminate air attacks that could kill civilians. Palestinian casualties are a propaganda coup for terrorists, and Israeli restraint saves lives and extends the window for its defense forces to act before they come under opportunistic condemnation from abroad.</td>

      <td>A Labor rule repeal to help unions will pinch contract workers.</td>
      <td>Employers are struggling to find workers as the economy recovers, but the Biden Administration continues to make it harder. The latest blunder from Washington is the repeal of a Labor Department rule that made it easier for companies to hire contract-based workers.<br />Last week Labor rescinded a rule that updated the government’s treatment of independent contractors. The Trump Administration enacted the rule in January to ensure that workers who set their own hours aren’t forced onto company payrolls. Many employers and workers value arrangements in which “the worker’s opportunity for profit or loss [is] based on initiative and/or investment,” as the rule’s text puts it.<br />The repeal is the Democrats’ latest shot in the union war over contract work, which includes app-based industries like ride-sharing and food delivery. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh says repealing the rule will “stop the erosion of worker protections.” That’s a reference to benefits like healthcare and retirement, often excluded from contractors’ compensation.<br />Yet the evidence shows most contractors accept the trade-off between flexibility and benefits. Company-sponsored surveys in 2020 showed that 82% of Uber and  Lyft  drivers preferred not to be classified as employees.<br />These workers often use their gigs for supplemental income. Sixty-one percent of Uber drivers in 2016 held other full- or part-time jobs, according to a Princeton University study. Having access to these workers’ spare hours has let employers expand rapidly and given consumers greater access to affordable services.</td>

      <td>A new rule requires them to make ‘living wills’ for surviving a downturn without taxpayer bailouts.</td>
      <td>This time last year, housing industry insiders were predicting that the market would collapse under the weight of the pandemic. The opposite happened. Even as the economy suffered its worst year since World War II, the housing market boomed.<br />But that doesn’t mean all is well. Rising prices have masked but not eliminated longstanding problems and vulnerabilities at the heart of America’s housing market. Most urgently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—the government-sponsored enterprises that own or guarantee roughly half the $12 trillion mortgage market—lack the capital to survive the next inevitable downturn in home prices.<br />The good news is that unlike the crisis in 2008, should the GSEs fail again, creditors, rather than taxpayers, can absorb the losses. That’s because the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which I direct, completed a new rule last month that creates a process to end taxpayer bailouts of the GSEs once and for all.<br />By requiring the GSEs to maintain credible resolution plans known as “living wills,” the new rule will enable a failing GSE to be restructured without risk to business continuity or America’s mortgage market. Similar to the requirements put in place by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. under the Dodd-Frank Act, the resolution plans will facilitate rapid and orderly resolution if necessary.<br />For the first time in history, the GSEs are required to demonstrate how, in the event of insolvency, core business lines and charters would be maintained to support the housing-finance system without extraordinary government assistance. By establishing the rules of the road in an insolvency, these living wills give future investors the information they need to price risk appropriately. This is a prerequisite for the GSEs to raise private capital, which is key to the housing market’s long-term stability.</td>

      <td>A modest plan would restore integrity to federal regulation.</td>
      <td>The New York Attorney General’s office announced an astonishing finding on May 6. Of the more than 22 million comments filed in response to the Federal Communication Commission’s hotly contested 2017 “net neutrality” repeal, nearly 18 million were fraudulent. A 19-year-old computer science student filed nearly eight million of them using automated software.<br />According to the Administrative Procedure Act, federal agencies like the FCC must give notice to the public when they propose to write new rules. Then the public can comment on those proposals. The agency must review all public comments before publishing an order detailing final rules, along with the legal and policy rationales for enacting them.<br />Parties that stand to gain one way or another pay to generate comments, as was shown in the New York report. To comment, you don’t need to use your own name, you don’t need to be American, and you can comment multiple times. Stuffing the regulatory ballot box is all too easy, and politicians love to say, “Millions of Americans have filed comments supporting my view.”<br />But there is a solution. Before the advent of electronic commenting, comments on proposed rules were submitted through the mail. The cost of mailing a letter served as a barrier to fraud. By introducing a small fee for electronic comments—say, the price of a postage stamp, currently 55 cents—agencies could reduce comment fraud.<br />In an ordinary rulemaking, all comments are considered. But when comments are tainted by massive fraudulent submissions, agency staff must choose which comments to consider and which to ignore. Those from groups that lobby an agency intensively are most likely to be considered. Other comments, both legitimate and not, are likely to be ignored.</td>

      <td>The company is expecting a travel rebound, but will likely need more hosts to meet demand</td>
      <td>The pandemic supplied  Airbnb  with lots of problems, but returning demand isn’t one of them.<br />Last summer, its Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky said Covid-19 wiped out nearly everything his company had built over 12 years in a matter of weeks. Now, with vaccines widely circulating, Mr. Chesky says we are about to have a travel rebound “unlike anything we have seen before.” He should be careful what he wishes for.<br />The home-sharing giant reported first-quarter topline results on Thursday that topped Wall Street estimates in a big way. Revenue of $887 million was 23% higher than analysts polled by FactSet had estimated. But the more telling comparison is relative to other online travel platforms: Airbnb grew revenue 5% year on year, while  Expedia Group ,   Booking Holdings  and  Marriott International  reported that their revenue fell by an average of more than 48% over the same period.<br />Average daily rates rose on Airbnb in the first quarter from last year given a shift in supply and demand for more desirable alternative accommodations such as single family homes. Furthermore, last year’s revenue number was significantly impacted by cancellations when the pandemic first hit.<br />Perhaps most impressive is that Airbnb said its gross bookings value grew by a whopping 50% in the first quarter from a year earlier and 3% over the same period of 2019, indicating that consumers have grown more confident in their ability to travel again. This level of consumer demand hasn’t been seen industrywide: Both Booking and Expedia reported declines in year-over-year bookings in their first quarter earnings results last week.</td>

      <td>The now-vilified friar offered a vision to overcome American acrimony.</td>
      <td>The San Gabriel, Calif., Fire Department and Archdiocese of Los Angeles recently confirmed what many had long suspected: The fire that almost destroyed Mission San Gabriel Arcángel last year was arson. John David Corey Jr., 57, was charged with the crime last week and faces up to 14 years in prison if convicted.<br />Founded in 1771 by St. Junipero Serra, Mission San Gabriel is a historic icon and a living community of Catholic faithful. Franciscan friars—America’s other founding fathers—built this magnificent building, the oldest in Los Angeles County. Beneath its bell tower lies a hammered copper baptismal font given to the mission by King Carlos III of Spain. The first baptisms of native Tongva children took place there, a tradition that continued until the fire rendered the mission unusable in July.<br />This is what the arsonist attacked: a physical manifestation of a centuries-long tradition, a rare achievement in sacred architecture, a monument to California’s Hispanic history, a vital contemporary place of worship, and a powerful testimony to the unity of all human beings made possible in Christ. The hope of achieving that unity brought St. Junipero Serra to California more than two centuries ago.<br />Like countless other Spanish Franciscans, Serra left his homeland not in search of gold or fame but to live in communion with America’s native peoples. An incurable leg infection hobbled the saint’s step but not his quest. The mission system that he extended up the coast of what is now California testifies to his efforts.<br />But over the past decade Serra has been caught in the crossfire of the divisive iconoclasm overtaking American culture. At least seven statues of him have been smashed or defaced since 2016. With the exception of those caught on tape trespassing onto Mission San Rafael Arcángel—in which case San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone pressed charges—none have been prosecuted.</td>

      <td>The business is rewarding but also volatile. Overwork and unstable employment are commonplace.</td>
      <td>When it was launched in December, “Cyberpunk 2077” was one of the most eagerly anticipated videogames in years. The role-playing game takes place in Night City, a violent dystopia full of hackers and mercenaries, and actor Keanu Reeves has a starring role. But the game’s developer, Poland-based CD Projekt Red, goofed the rollout. Players immediately reported that the game was plagued by glitches: characters randomly levitating, for instance. It emerged that, as “Cyberpunk” was heading toward release, staffers knew that it wasn’t ready for prime time. Bugs were being discovered even as management declared that the game could be pressed to discs.<br />Jason Schreier covered the debacle for Bloomberg News, and in “Press Reset” he draws a broader portrait of the volatile videogame industry. He follows the employees at a number of companies as they navigate the highs and lows of a rewarding yet frequently chaotic line of work. Mr. Schreier, whose “Blood, Sweat and Pixels” (2017) explored the process by which videogames are made, writes lucidly and entertainingly. For neophytes, “Press Reset” is a useful introduction to the business of videogames. For those who play, and who will inevitably recognize the titles and developers that Mr. Schreier discusses, the book may well prove compulsively readable.<br />The videogame industry, we learn, is rife with overwork and unstable employment. As Mr. Schreier shows, creating a videogame places heavy demands on the designers, programmers and other workers involved. He tells the story behind “BioShock Infinite,” developed by Irrational Games and released in 2013. The game, which stars a former Pinkerton agent and is set in the fictional airborne city of Columbia in 1912, was overseen by Irrational’s Ken Levine, a visionary but demanding boss. “Over the course of BioShock Infinite’s development,” Mr. Schreier writes, “the game changed constantly as Levine scrapped and overhauled ideas both big and small.” Mr. Levine would tell his staff to make major adjustments “seemingly at a whim. . . . Every cut or change Levine made had trickle-down effects. . . . It was demoralizing to put weeks of your life into something only to watch it get flushed down the drain.”<br />A number of senior staffers quit during the game’s development, fed up with the work environment. “BioShock Infinite” received rave reviews, but its creators were mentally exhausted. A year after the game’s release, Mr. Levine announced that he was quitting Irrational to start a new studio. A handful of people were selected to join him, but everyone else was laid off. As Mr. Schreier writes of the “BioShock Infinite” team: “They’d given up countless hours of personal and family time to finish it. Their reward for that was to lose their jobs? If just felt so unfair.”<br />One of the more surprising episodes in “Press Reset” concerns MLB pitching legend Curt Schilling. In 2006 he founded a videogame company called Green Monster Games, later renamed 38 Studios and initially based in Maynard, Mass. Mr. Schilling used his star power to secure a $75 million loan from the state of Rhode Island in 2010 in exchange for moving operations to Providence. One employee, art director Thom Ang, had bought a house in Massachusetts and then moved again to Rhode Island. Another, Andy Johnson, moved from Arizona to Rhode Island to oversee “localization” efforts—the work of getting games into different languages and countries.</td>

      <td>Colonial Pipeline Co. paid a ransom to the criminal hackers who caused the company to shut down the country’s largest conduit of fuel, according to people familiar with the matter, a payment that allowed the firm to obtain decryption tools to try to unlock its computer systems.<br />The company restarted pipeline operations Wednesday and said it was resuming service throughout its entire system Thursday after a cyberattack last week forced it to shut it down, leading to regional gasoline shortages and higher prices. It couldn’t be learned whether the ransom payment directly enabled Colonial to restart its 5,500-mile conduit, which runs from Texas to New Jersey.<br />Energy analysts said it would likely take days before gasoline supplies are returned to normal in affected states in the Southeast.<br />Bloomberg reported earlier Thursday that Colonial had paid the hackers a sum of nearly $5 million, and that the decryption tool ultimately wasn’t effective in restoring operations. Instead, Colonial was able to recover by relying on system backups, Bloomberg reported. The Journal couldn’t corroborate the amount of the ransom payment.<br />Colonial declined to comment on the ransom.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A sweeping overhaul of the military justice system has earned the backing of 61 senators from both parties, clearing a critical threshold needed to advance the legislation after years of resistance from the Pentagon.<br />The bill would change the way the U.S. military prosecutes sexual assault and other serious crimes by stripping commanders of their authority to decide whether to send such cases to trial. Instead, independent military prosecutors would make those calls.<br />Forty-one Democrats, two independents and 18 Republicans—including the majority of Senate Armed Services Committee members—have now signed on as co-sponsors of the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act, written by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) and Joni Ernst (R., Iowa). Co-sponsors span the political spectrum from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri to independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has supported previous iterations of the bill. His office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.<br />That level of support is enough to overcome the Senate filibuster rule, which requires at least 60 votes for most bills to advance. The bill would have to pass the House and Senate before heading to President Biden’s desk for his signature, but its supporters say they are optimistic that it could become law this year.</td>

Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.), a lead negotiator for the GOP on the package, said Thursday after an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Biden and five other Republican senators that the president “asked us to come back and rework an offer so he can then react to that and re-offer to us. So we’re very encouraged.”<br />Mr. Biden said after the meeting that he was optimistic the group could reach a reasonable agreement and planned to discuss a more detailed offer from the Republican senators next week. The group had previously released a two-page plan that called for unspecified user fees to cover its cost.<br />Mr. Biden has said he is open to a compromise on his $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal, which calls for new spending on roads, bridges, broadband, and boosting electric vehicles and semiconductor manufacturing. He has held meetings this week with congressional leaders and centrist Democratic senators.<br />Republicans have said they could support a narrower plan in the range of $600 to $800 billion but have rejected the president’s proposal to pay for it by raising taxes on companies.</td>

      <td>Loss in the first quarter narrows but misses analysts’ estimates</td>
      <td>DoorDash  Inc.’s  revenue tripled in the first quarter, showing sustained demand for food-delivery services even as coronavirus vaccinations picked up and the nation moved toward reopening.<br />The San Francisco-based company reported revenue of $1.08 billion for the three months through March, up from $362 million in the same quarter a year earlier, beating Wall Street’s forecast. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected revenue of $994 million.<br />“The negative impact that we were expecting in consumer behavior was smaller than we were anticipating,” Chief Financial Officer Prabir Adarkar said in an interview Thursday. The company’s better-than-expected revenue helped drive shares up nearly 8% in after-hours trading.<br />While DoorDash slightly narrowed its loss to $110 million from a loss of $129 million in the same quarter last year, the figure missed analysts’ projections of a $63 million loss. Mr. Adarkar said the company was focused on investing in growth and capitalizing on the shift in consumer behavior in the near term.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic served as an unexpected boon for DoorDash. The company gobbled up more than half of the U.S. food-delivery market in January, up from just over one-third a year ago, according to market research firm Edison Trends. Analysts say the company leapfrogged its rivals thanks to a strong footprint in the suburbs, a wider selection of restaurants and greater operational efficiency in delivering the food itself.</td>

      <td>The fight is on for lower-wage workers.<br />Some of the biggest U.S. employers of entry-level workers are adding tens of thousands of new positions as the economy roars back from the coronavirus pandemic. Many are raising wages or adding perks to entice workers away from other jobs or off the sidelines of the labor market.<br />Amazon.com Inc. said Thursday that it would hire 75,000 more workers and offer $1,000 signing bonuses in some locations, its latest hiring spree in a year of tremendous job growth at the e-commerce giant.  McDonald’s Corp.  said that it wants to hire 10,000 employees at company-owned restaurants in the next three months and that it would raise pay at those locations.  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.,  Applebee’s and KFC are among other chains seeking to hire tens of thousands of workers as they reopen dining rooms and seek to bolster staffing there.<br />Many companies have struggled to find enough available workers, though there are signs that more are entering the labor market to take some of those open positions. The Labor Department said Thursday that jobless claims had continued a several-week slide to new pandemic lows.<br />Demand for workers is so high that wages are rising, too. Average hourly earnings for private-sector employees rose by 21 cents to $30.17 last month, according to a recent Labor Department report. The gain is notable because strong hiring in the lower-wage hospitality sector would typically put downward pressure on average earnings, economists said.</td>

Enact said Thursday that recent market volatility meant that “current market pricing for the planned offering does not accurately reflect Enact’s value.”<br />The stock market, while still up for the year, has fallen sharply this week. The S&P 500 dropped 4% in the first three days of the week, its steepest three-day decline in seven months, though the index rebounded by 1.2% on Thursday.

Enact, a spinoff of  Genworth Financial Inc.,  was looking to raise about $500 million, according to regulatory filings.<br />The decisions to postpone the offerings are the latest signs of cooling for the U.S. IPO market, which has been hot for nearly a year.</td>

New York-based Apollo took the retailer private roughly two years ago for more than $1 billion, and sold its warehouse business to distributor  US Foods Holding Corp.  for $970 million last year.<br />The deal comes as grocery sales have grown robustly over the past year. More people stayed home and cooked after restaurants and bars shut down during the pandemic.

She said 89% of educators in her union have been fully vaccinated or want to be.<br />Ms. Weingarten’s message was part of a wide-ranging speech about the future of education following the once-in-a-generation disruption to school caused by the global pandemic. Along with reopening in the fall, schools should also use this moment to reconsider traditional ways of testing students, decreasing class sizes and hiring more teachers, counselors and school nurses, among other changes, she said. She also emphasized school as an important institution for children to grow emotionally and socially.</td>

      <td>Fed governor said officials need to see ‘several more months of data’ before determining when to adjust policy</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. economy is “going gangbusters,” but the Federal Reserve needs to see several more months of data on jobs and inflation before determining when to begin scaling back its easy-money policies, a central banker said.<br />Over the past week, official data have shown April job creation falling far short of economists’ forecasts, evidence of a shortage of available workers, and consumer prices rising much faster than expected, Fed governor Christopher Waller said Thursday. But he called for central bankers to remain patient.<br />“The May and June jobs report may reveal that April was an outlier, but we need to see that first before we start thinking about adjusting our policy stance,” Mr. Waller said in a speech. “We also need to see if the unusually high price pressures we saw in the April CPI [consumer-price index] report will persist in the months ahead.”<br />Since last year, the Fed has held interest rates near zero and purchased $120 billion of bonds each month to support the economy’s recovery from the pandemic-induced recession. Most Fed officials said in March that they expected to leave rates on hold through 2023. Policy makers plan to continue the current rate of bond purchases until the economy makes “substantial further progress.”<br />Data released Wednesday showed the consumer-price index surged 4.2% in April from a year earlier, prompting market participants to bet that the Fed will start raising rates sooner than officials expect.</td>

      <td>With the help of an eccentric academic and his associates, a Danish soldier, played by Mads Mikkelsen, seeks vengeance on the biker gang he believes killed his wife</td>
      <td>Usually the simplest part of writing about a movie is designating its genre. We all know the main ones, which is why they’re useful as shorthand guides—action, drama, thriller, comedy, romance and the like, often in combination. The most straightforward description of “Riders of Justice,” in Danish with English subtitles, is a drama with intense action elements and darkly comic overtones. But it might be described more accurately as a deliciously absurdist, fundamentally serious, even philosophical enterprise that uses a superheated revenge plot to address our common need for making sense out of life. This whatever-you-want-to-call-it, playing in a few theaters this week and streaming on demand next week, is also one of the most fascinating films I’ve seen in a long while.<br />Orson Welles ended “Citizen Kane” with the incineration of a child’s sled. “Riders of Justice,” which was written and directed by Anders Thomas Jensen, starts with the theft of a bicycle. It’s the first in a sequence of events leading a mother, Emma (Anne Birgitte Lind), and her teenage daughter, Mathilde (Andrea Heick Gadeberg), to a suburban train and a terrible accident that takes Emma’s life. The husband and father, Markus, is played by the great Mads Mikkelsen, barely recognizable behind a graying beard and lethal glower. A Danish soldier deployed in Afghanistan, Markus returns to Denmark to console Mathilde, a task for which the icy warrior is eminently unsuited; his idea of emotional support is assuring the stricken girl that she can banish her insomnia by counting backward from 500.<br />If truth be told, Markus is equally shattered by the seeming randomness of the tragedy. That changes when an eccentric academic named Otto (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) shows up at the front door. We’ve seen him before. He was in the same car of the ill-fated train, and gave Emma his seat. Now he has a theory based on his expertise in probability calculation. The crash, Otto believes, was not an accident but an elaborately orchestrated assassination of someone seated in the same car—a thug from a notoriously vicious biker gang, Riders of Justice, who’d been scheduled to testify against his buddies in a murder case. The theory seems so plausible to Markus that he, with help from Otto and a couple of his associates, mounts a vendetta against the gang in order to avenge his wife’s death.<br />All of that would suggest genre purity, a by-the-numbers letting of blood. But Otto is no ordinary academic, and “eccentric” barely begins to describe him, or the workings of his mind. He and his buddies are dulcetly nutso, and all of them are played by quicksilver-brilliant comic actors. Lars Brygmann is Lennart, a bright-eyed imp who still seems to be crazy after 4,000 hours of therapy (though not so crazy that he can’t pass in Mathilde’s eyes for a crisis counselor). Nicolas Bro is Emmenthaler, a hacker with a fragile psyche, a blimp’s physique, a fixation on computer-monitor resolution, and a doomed passion for playing the French horn.<br />They are three mad mice sniffing out statistical cheese. They’re so marvelously strange and funny that Mr. Mikkelsen’s stone-faced Markus starts to seem comical too in his pitiless prosecution of a mission based on questionable inferences and dubious suppositions. Others fill out the cast of memorable characters: Gustav Lindh as Bodashka, a sweet and hapless Ukrainian hustler; Albert Rudbeck Lindhardt as Sirius, Mathilde’s devoted boyfriend.</td>

      <td>The New Group’s unrelievedly bleak production of Samuel Beckett’s classic starring Ethan Hawke and John Leguizamo would have felt more relevant at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.</td>
      <td>What plays were best suited to home viewing at the height of America’s murderous pandemic? At first I hungered for the fizzing diversion of high comedy, but it turned out that what I really needed was deeply serious fare—though the play I most longed to see split the difference, a baggy-pants comedy about the meaninglessness of life that is one of the 20th century’s greatest works of theatrical art. Yet for more than a year, no one seemed to have thought to webcast a staging of Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot,” ideal though it was to the occasion, not only because of its subject matter but because it calls for only a small cast (four men and a boy) and the simplest of sets (a tree by a lonely country road).<br />So is it too late for “Godot”? That’d be like saying it’s too late for “Macbeth” or “The Iceman Cometh.” There is no time when such masterpieces do not speak resoundingly to all that is within and around us. But the New Group’s webcast version, directed by Scott Elliott, has surely missed its moment, if it ever had one: Not only does it feel pandemic-specific in a way that is already dated, but it simply isn’t very good. With the sole exception of an eight-minute star-turn monologue by Wallace Shawn, it’s draggily paced, portentous and—worst of all—not even slightly funny.<br />It often surprises people who know “Godot” only by reputation to discover that much of it is, in fact, wildly funny. The American debut was actually billed in newspaper ads as “the laugh sensation of two continents.” That’s a trifle misleading, but it is true that “Godot” is an assemblage of comic devices, many of them drawn from vaudeville and silent movies (Beckett even wrote a short film in 1965 in which Buster Keaton starred). Bert Lahr, who played the Cowardly Lion in “The Wizard of Oz” and starred in the play’s 1956 Broadway premiere, was no kind of intellectual, but he understood “Godot” on a different, identically valid level, telling his agent, “I know it’s supposed to be tragic, but there are lots of gags.” That was Beckett’s point: Faced with the absurdity of the human condition, what can we do but laugh, not bitterly but with our whole hearts? To this end, he gives us Vladimir and Estragon (played here by Ethan Hawke and John Leguizamo, with Drake Bradshaw, Mr. Shawn and Tarik Trotter in supporting roles), two bowler-hatted tramps sitting restlessly under a tree, hoping for the arrival of a mysterious man named Godot who never shows up, killing time by clowning around and exchanging pingpong-like repartée that is all too clearly meant to conceal their fear of the dark rendezvous that awaits us all.<br />A crepuscular Zoom-based production of “Godot,” which is what Mr. Elliott has given us, would have been on the mark a year ago, when Zoom felt like an electronic metaphor for the locked-down, terrified world in which we lived. But the best online theater has long since broken out of its cramped little boxes and become vastly more resourceful in staging and design, and “Godot” in particular would have benefited from being filmed in an empty theater or isolated outdoor location by a “bubble” of artists who could share physical space and interact directly with one another.<br />This “Godot,” by contrast, is rigidly conventional in its use of Zoom, which might have been at least tolerable had Mr. Elliott and his cast not stripped out every trace of the wit that is essential to the play’s dramatic effect. Mr. Leguizamo went so far as to claim in an interview with the Washington Post that he “didn’t feel the sadness, the pain, the anger, the hunger” in earlier productions of the play. To each, of course, his own, but anyone who found the uproarious 2009 Broadway revival of “Godot,” which starred Bill Irwin and Nathan Lane, to be lacking in any way in sadness and pain surely missed Beckett’s point.</td>

      <td>On Amazon Prime Video, director Barry Jenkins adapts Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel in a series both harrowing and beautiful.</td>
      <td>In his 2016 novel, “The Underground Railroad,” Colson Whitehead made a metaphor out of a metaphor, making the fabled fugitive-slave route of the antebellum South into a literal uptown subway, a mystery train to emancipation. He also made slavery into an allegory for slavery: His understanding with his reader was that no collection of facts could do justice to the history involved. But fantasy might.<br />No one familiar with the Barry Jenkins of “Moonlight” (Oscar’s Best Picture of 2016) or his James Baldwin adaptation “If Beale Street Could Talk” (2018) doubted that the writer-director would make Mr. Whitehead’s material his own. He does. The story moves at the director’s pace, and much of this 10-part Amazon series is deliriously, cinematically beautiful despite the context. In telling the story of Cora (South African actress Thuso Mbedu), her flight from a Georgia plantation, her various sideways journeys en route to freedom and her yearning for her runaway mother, he conjures visual poetry where there should be none, with all the consequent exhilaration that artistic aspiration delivers.<br />At the same time, the dominant quality of “The Underground Railroad,” especially in the early going, is terror. Two kinds of terror, in fact—the long-range dread of a hopeless future living under the thumb of psychopaths and the more immediate terror imposed by the whip, the chain and the auto-da-fé. I have to admit, I found myself resenting Mr. Jenkins for subjecting the viewer to some of the abominations depicted in episode 1. Then I snapped out of it. But let the prospective viewer be forewarned: Travel on “The Underground Railroad” is harrowing.<br />The hallucinatory images that introduce the series—a symbolic merging of the birth canal and the Railroad; Cora’s emergence; her mother, Mabel, burying the placenta and at some point fleeing—are followed by matters very real. Flashing forward, we’re shown Caesar (Aaron Pierre) pleading with Cora to run from the plantation and get on the Underground Railroad, which may be a myth, but as someone says “nothing in the world tells me this is not possible”: If slavery itself can exist, why not an Underground Railroad that carries the enslaved from station to station, from world to world? Cora resists at first, then relents, kills a young slavecatcher during a melee in the woods and thus has her future mapped out: She can never go back. Death or freedom are her only choices.<br />On her trail is Ridgeway (Joel Edgerton), another slavecatcher, who is nursing a Javert-like obsession with Cora—her mother, Mabel, was the only runaway who ever eluded him. Mr. Edgerton is a known quantity, but Ms. Mbedu is a revelation, playing Cora not as some idealized heroine but a hunted, haunted figure, one who more often than not is trying to make herself disappear to avoid the lash. Given a taste of liberation, she blossoms, as we see in episode 2. The glimpse of possibility is painful.</td>

      <td>Once again welcoming visitors, a new automobile museum in Jacksonville, Fla., with an impressive collection of Millers, Porsches and more race cars was open for only seven weeks before Covid-19 hit.</td>
      <td>Jacksonville, Fla.<br />If you’ve ever seen a race car stall at the starting line, you know how the Brumos Collection—a little gem of an automobile museum here—must have felt. Only seven weeks after opening in January 2020, in a red-brick building that’s an architectural homage to the long-shuttered local Ford plant, the museum had to close its doors because of Covid-19. Now Brumos has reopened and is getting a second chance to make a first impression. From May 20 through May 23, the museum will have two automobiles at the Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance. But visitors to that upscale car show an hour north of this city should check out the roughly 38 cars on view at Brumos itself, drawn from its total collection of 76 vehicles.<br />The 35,000-square-foot display progresses in chronological order, its horseshoe-shaped gallery space divided into two sections: Forerunners, largely featuring early Grand Prix and Indy race cars from the 1910s, and Frontrunners, which chronicles the cars and successes of Brumos Racing, which began in the 1950s, going through several iterations, and whose cars often sported the number 59. In fact, during the pandemic closure the museum kept interest alive through a YouTube series called “Inside the 59.”<br />The first cars that catch your eye in the Forerunners section are a pair of Peugeots. The 1910 Lion-Peugeot V2Y2 is a two-seat, open-cockpit touring car for the well-to-do of the era that features wide bucket seats, sculpted fenders and a green-gray paint scheme with distinctive pinstriping. It has a two-cylinder engine that produces some 16 horsepower and a top speed of 35 mph. Fast-forward four years to the 1914 Peugeot L45, the first car to sport a dual overhead camshafts engine, which the museum explains through its informative interactive kiosks would become the blueprint for high-performance engines for decades to come: With four valves per cylinder, the design moves more air into the engine, creating better performance, more power and higher speeds. It has a top speed of 111 mph, four-wheel brakes, and dominated the early years of European auto racing.<br />The museum also boasts one of the best collections of Millers in the U.S., named after American race-car builder Harry Miller, whose innovative vehicles won the Indianapolis 500 nine times. The most famous on display here is the 1920 TNT Special, one of the first ever built and the oldest surviving Miller, the museum claims. It has an inline four-cylinder, 166-cubic-inch, dual overhead cam engine that many speculate Miller “developed” after working on Peugeots in his Los Angeles shop. There’s also a 1923 Miller 122 Grand Prix car, dubbed “The Zborowski Miller,” that was built exclusively to race in Europe. It was driven in the 1923 Italian Grand Prix at Monza by Count Louis Zborowski. He was killed a year later, just 29 years old, while driving for Mercedes. Zborowski’s globe-trotting exploits inspired James Bond creator Ian Fleming to write the children’s book “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.”</td>

From 2012 to 2019, more than $500,000 of the children’s tuition was paid for with checks signed by either Mr. Weisselberg or Mr. Trump, the two children’s mother, Jennifer Weisselberg, told The Wall Street Journal. She is the former wife of Mr. Weisselberg’s son Barry.<br />Ms. Weisselberg said she told Manhattan prosecutors that she and Barry understood the tuition payments to be part of her ex-husband’s compensation package at the Trump Organization, where he worked. Former prosecutors not involved in the probe said the Manhattan district attorney’s office could be examining whether the Weisselbergs evaded taxes with the tuition-payment arrangement.<br />The subpoena marks a separate front in the investigation of Mr. Trump by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.’s office, which has for months been seeking Allen Weisselberg’s cooperation, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Weisselberg has worked for the Trump Organization for decades and is regarded as Mr. Trump’s confidant and his company’s financial gatekeeper. Mr. Weisselberg hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing.<br />Prosecutors often seek the cooperation of someone possibly involved in a crime to obtain confidential information and provide a potential road map to records or documents. Typically, prosecutors offer a potential defendant leniency in exchange for their help. Putting pressure on a possible defendant’s family is one way to encourage cooperation.</td>

      <td>I’ve got beefs with the Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame and those ‘best place to live’ lists.</td>
      <td>Vote recounts are much in the news today, but there’s no good reason they should be limited to politics. This is where Jethro Tull comes in.<br />Tull was a fabulously successful band that sold tens of millions of records in the 1970s and ‘80s. Yet, for some mysterious reason, they’re still not in the Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame. Yes, they were arty and pretentious, but so were Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Pink Floyd and Yes, and those bands are in the Hall. It doesn’t add up.<br />One possibility is that the voting for new inductees has deliberately been rigged to keep Tull from entering the Pantheon of the Immortals. One theory I’ve heard posits that the ballots submitted by rock critics are replaced in the dead of night by bogus ballots shipped in by jealous fans from places like Hawaii and Idaho, where there are no great rock bands. There is an easy way to settle this controversy: Check the ballots to see if they smell of taters or pineapple.<br />An honest recount of Hall of Fame ballots would also ensure that heavy metal titans Iron Maiden—just snubbed again this week—finally get the honors they so richly deserve. I personally suspect that lots of the ballots cast in favor of those stars were altered by miffed fans of bands like Echo & the Bunnymen and the Psychedelic Furs because they loathe headbangers. And only widespread ballot tampering can explain why the great ‘60s band Paul Revere & the Raiders is not in the Hall. Talk about getting taken for a ride.<br />Recounts would be warmly welcomed in other areas where fame—or infamy—is the issue. Historians routinely vote for James Buchanan as the worst president ever. That’s because Andrew Johnson aficionados always stuff the ballot box. And they get lots of help from Warren Harding and Herbert Hoover supporters. Yes, Buchanan was awful, doing nothing to prevent the Civil War. But Johnson was worse, deliberately undermining everything the Civil War was fought to achieve. He was a racist and a coward and nobody liked him. A recount is long overdue.</td>

      <td>OTTAWA—Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau didn’t violate the country’s conflict-of-interest laws when his Liberal government awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to a charity with financial ties with his family, according to the results of an investigation released Thursday.<br />Tumult over the contract to WE Charity, a Toronto-based organization that in the past paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Mr. Trudeau’s mother and brother to participate at its events, dogged Mr. Trudeau and Liberal officials for much of last summer.<br />The uproar prompted Bill Morneau, then Canada’s finance minister, to step down last August and leave politics and focus on becoming the new head of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. He didn’t get the OECD job.<br />The WE Charity affair marked the third ethics probe targeting Mr. Trudeau since he came to power over five years ago, although the first in which he was cleared of wrongdoing.<br />“Although the connection between Mr. Trudeau’s relatives and WE created the appearance of a conflict of interest, the appearance of conflict is insufficient to cause a contravention” of Canada’s conflict-of-interest laws, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion said. “I am satisfied that there was no opportunity to further Mr. Trudeau’s own interests or those of his relatives from WE’s role” in running a student-volunteer program, valued at nearly 1 billion Canadian dollars, or the equivalent of $820 million.</td>

      <td>The Indian leader’s vanity, governing style and focus on politics made the crisis worse than it had to be.</td>
      <td>Is Narendra Modi to blame for the carnage that Covid has wrought in India? It may be too soon to predict how voters will respond, but it’s not too soon to assess the evidence. Any prime minister would likely have struggled to cope with the pandemic’s brutal second wave, but Mr. Modi’s overweening vanity, overly centralized style of governance, and relentless focus on electoral advantage made him particularly unsuited to the task. His Bharatiya Janata Party’s Hindu nationalist ideology—which makes it loath to alienate “godmen” who are at odds with modern medicine—didn’t help either.<br />On Wednesday, India recorded nearly 363,000 Covid cases and 4,120 deaths, about 30% of deaths world-wide from Covid that day. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle estimates the true number of cases at more than 20 times the official figure, averaging between seven million and nine million a day since mid-April.<br />Experts say India is vastly undercounting deaths as well. Earlier this week, Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, estimated that at least 25,000 Indians are dying from Covid each day. Murad Banaji, a mathematician at London’s Middlesex University who tracks the pandemic in India closely, says the real death rate is three to eight times the official figure—or between 12,360 and 32,960 deaths on Wednesday alone.<br />Anecdotal evidence supports these grim estimates. Every day, journalists report new horrors: corpses floating in the Ganges River, oxygen shortages leading to mass deaths in hospital intensive-care units, funeral pyres taking over parking lots for lack of space in crematoria. Anxious Indians flood social media with pleas for oxygen, lifesaving drugs and hospital beds for their loved ones. In Mumbai and Delhi it’s hard to find anyone who hasn’t lost a friend or family member to the disease. The world has launched a massive aid effort to help India, but for many people this won’t make up for their own government’s failures.<br />With crowded cities, abysmal air quality and a rickety healthcare system, India was always at risk from the pandemic. But Indians also had reason to hope. The country produces more than half the world’s vaccines and 20% of generic medicines. Public-health experts hold up its successful mass vaccination program against polio as a model. As of Wednesday, however, India had managed to vaccinate less than 3% of its population fully. (About 10% of Indians have received at least one shot.) Amid shortages, the vaccination program has slowed from a high of 4.3 million shots a day in early April to 2.2 million shots on Wednesday.</td>

      <td>IT’S BEEN A BUSY year for Portland, Ore., chef Gregory Gourdet. For five months, at the height of the pandemic, he ran Kann, a Haitian-inspired pop-up and outdoor yurt village. He also entered a pod of 180 people to film the Portland-based 18th season of “Top Chef,” in which he appeared not as a cheftestant, as he has in seasons past, but in the role of guest judge. Just this week, he published his first cookbook, “Everyone’s Table: Global Recipes for Modern Health” (Harper Wave).<br />The recipes reflect Mr. Gourdet’s culinary CV as well as the way he eats at home. He earned his chops cooking light, bright, cosmopolitan fare in a number of star-chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s restaurants, and he draws inspiration from the assertive flavors of Haiti, where his family is from, as well as other cuisines. After overcoming addiction several years ago, Mr. Gourdet took up an intense commitment to physical fitness and a paleo diet to fuel it. The recipes in “Everyone’s Table” contain no gluten, dairy, soy, refined sugar or legumes. They are ideal for the modern family that likely accommodates at least one “dietary distinction”; Mr. Gourdet refuses to think of them as restrictions. The 200 vibrant, satisfying dishes—from tamarind barbecue ribs to luxurious slow-cooked salmon—stand out for how much flavor they pack in, not what’s “missing.” “You wouldn’t notice, and that’s the point,” writes Mr. Gourdet. “All you’d see is food you want to make.”<br />The kitchen tool I can’t live without is: my spice grinder. I just use a $20 coffee grinder. And my small digital scale. And my Microplane, because I love zesting citrus with it, mincing ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon sticks. It’s really handy. I tested my book with the worst blender in the world just to make sure that no matter what type of blender you have, you can make the recipes. But investing in a high-wattage blender is definitely something I encourage. It makes life so much easier.<br />The cookbook I turn to again and again is: “Thai Food” by David Thompson. I read that book a lot. And “Zahav” by Michael Solomonov and Steven Cook—it’s very comprehensive. Another one of my favorite books is “American Seafood” by Barton Seaver. I love “The Food Lab” by J. Kenji López-Alt because of the science behind it, and it has such perfect basic techniques. And “Jubilee” by Toni Tipton Martin, for the history and culture and stories behind the food.<br />My pantry is always stocked with: a vast array of chiles, from Thai chiles to chipotles, guajillo, ancho, chile flakes, chile oil. Alternative flours too: almond flour, coconut flour, tapioca starch. And alternative sweeteners: maple syrup, honey, coconut sugar, palm sugar. Fish sauce. Also olive oil, coconut oil and avocado oil.</td>

      <td>Amazon.com Inc.  is hiring 75,000 workers and offering $1,000 signing bonuses in some locations, the latest hiring spree in what has been a year of tremendous growth.<br />The retail and tech giant said the new roles—representing nearly 8% of its U.S. workforce—are offering average pay of $17 an hour, an increase over the company’s typical starting wage of $15 an hour.<br />The company in April said it was raising wages for more than 500,000 hourly employees by between 50 cents and $3 an hour, an investment of more than $1 billion. Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky has said that competition for employees will rise.<br />“The economy is starting to open up, and there is a lot of need for new employees for a lot of different industries,” he said last month. Elsewhere Thursday,  McDonald’s Corp.  said it would raise pay for employees at company-owned restaurants in the U.S., one of the latest companies to bolster wages and benefits in the hunt for workers.<br />Amazon said Thursday the new jobs are for its warehousing network across the U.S. It said some areas with the most open positions include California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington and Michigan.</td>

They made it political, so let’s respond politically. One of the favorite bludgeons of the left is to use disparities in market participants as proof of bias (disparate impact). By this definition, clearly there are huge disparities (proof of bias, according to Democrats) in the political leanings of university professors and administrators—estimated at upward of 90% self-proclaimed Democrats.<br />In the name of fairness I propose that if any university wants to benefit from federal loans to finance its student body, it would be required to ensure that conservative values aren’t marginalized by the progressive majority. Those applying for employment at the university (professors, adjuncts and administrators) who identify as non-Democrats should be first in line to be hired until the political imbalance is rectified. Would the Democrats sacrifice their disparate-impact argument to protect their captured universities?<br />Michael W. Kenworthy<br />Chester, Vt.<br /></td>

      <td>Regarding Heather Mac Donald’s “Anticop Movement Wants Road Anarchy Too” (op-ed, April 23): Politeness can go a long way during a traffic stop. The majority of cops are doing a very good job protecting the public. Many are understandably nervous. And why not? Too many of them are getting killed in the line of duty. Effective law enforcement must be a partnership between the citizens and the police.<br />During a traffic stop the cop is in control, but you set the tone. Nobody likes getting pulled over, and truth be told, most cops don’t like making traffic stops, because they are dangerous. Don’t go very far when pulled over, because that will raise red flags. If it’s dark, turn on the interior lights, roll down your window and sit still with your hands on the steering wheel and be patient. The cop knows nothing about you. While there are some angry cops out there, most are good-natured and amiable. They react to what goes on around them. Start by being polite and answering the officer’s questions. If you are carrying a gun, let the officer know. The officer coming up to your window has no idea what is going to happen next. Help him make the right choice. It isn’t worth losing your life over a traffic stop.<br />Dan Nathan<br />Westlake Village, Calif.</td>

During the Obama years the group Acorn “registered” my college-age daughter. When she showed up at her precinct to vote they told her she wasn’t registered and therefore couldn’t vote. Do you think maybe Acorn “lost” her registration because she registered as a Republican?

      <td>McDonald’s Corp.  said it would raise pay for employees at company-owned restaurants in the U.S., one of the latest companies to bolster wages and benefits as they struggle to hire workers.<br />The burger giant said Thursday it would increase wages for more than 36,500 hourly workers by an average of 10% over the next several months. Nonmanagerial workers at the chain’s roughly 660 company-owned restaurants in the U.S. would earn at least $11 to $17 an hour at entry levels after the increases, McDonald’s said. Supervisors would earn an hourly minimum of $15 to $20. Nonmanagerial employees at company-owned stores earlier this year earned an average of nearly $12 an hour, McDonald’s said, and supervisors earned some $16 to $18 an hour.<br />McDonald’s owns a fraction of its 13,900 U.S. restaurants, around 95% of which are operated by franchisees. Owners have said they are reviewing pay and benefits at their stores. The National Owners Association, a group representing U.S. franchisees, said in an email to its members on Sunday that strong sales should allow operators to raise menu prices if they choose to compensate for higher spending on pay and benefits.<br />“We need to do whatever it takes to staff our restaurants and then charge for it,” the association said.<br />A shortage of workers across the U.S. economy has prompted some employers to boost pay and benefits as they hunt for workers.

It filled my helmet with a lot of wrong thoughts, shameful thoughts, that years of therapy were supposed to cure. I again feel a love that dare not speak its name, around my house anyway: motorcycle.<br />Not just any motorcycle, but a long-legged, stouthearted, perfectly balanced Italian sport tourer (max 33.9-inch seat height) brandishing rock plates and crash bars, with two-up seating and ride-height adjustable suspension, (optional) heated grips and two-position seat heaters, and a six-speed semiautomatic gearbox whose clutchless shifts are sweeter than angels’ kisses. I think in Kentucky it’s legal for us to get married.<br />While the Multistrada’s variety of Automatic Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is commonplace in automobiles, this is the first application on a series-production motorcycle. I’m a big fan. Relying on front and rear-mounted radar emitter/sensors integrated into the fairing, and answering to a clever switch array built into the left grip, the Multistrada’s ADAS functions are easy to set, easy to use and easy to rely on, from 18.5 to 99.4 mph.<br />When traffic ahead slows, the bike winds down the throttle, in sync, even brushing the brakes to keep a preset distance. As traffic speeds increase or the lane ahead clears, the bike will roll on the gas, signaling for upshifts, as necessary. Ghost rider requesting a tower flyby.<br />The adaptive system will automatically disengage if riders touch the brakes or hold in the clutch, if they lean over more than 50 degrees, or if they let speeds drop below the minimum. So they don’t fall over on their scarlet jock rocket.</td>

      <td>Congress should revive the ‘letter of marque’ and authorize companies to defend against hackers.</td>
      <td>After the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, the Goodyear blimp Resolute was put into service spotting enemy submarines. There’s a lesson for 21st-century cyberwarfare.<br />The Constitution gives Congress the power to issue “letters of marque and reprisal”—essentially licenses authorizing private parties to wage war on the government’s behalf. Congress issued letters of marque liberally until the end of the War of 1812, and they were particularly useful during the First Barbary War (1801-05). The fledgling U.S.’s fleet of six frigates couldn’t stem piracy alone. Letters of marque enlisted U.S. merchantman as far away as the Mediterranean, where Barbary states often provided pirate ships with safe harbor. In the typical 19th-century use, Congress issued letters of marque to schooners and sloops, giving their operators the authority to sink or capture pirate ships by force.<br />The Resolute was the first and only privately owned U.S. craft to operate under a letter of marque since then. The blimp was flown by a civilian crew out of Los Angeles. If letters of marque could be adapted for flying machines, why not computing machines? Recent destructive hacks have proved that federal action alone can’t protect the cyber infrastructure. The time has come to grant letters of marque to enlist and arm private corporations to defend their interests and America’s.<br />Today’s pirates sail the cyber seas searching for loot, by ransom or theft. Like their 19th-century maritime counterparts, they respect no sovereignty and disrupt commerce and daily life. This weekend’s Colonial Pipeline hack and the recent  SolarWinds  attack demonstrate the growing danger and sophistication of such assaults. Like the Barbary pirates, hackers frequently receive haven or direct support from hostile states like Russia or China.<br />Hackers routinely exploit private corporations as an entry point to lucrative private assets or national-security vulnerabilities. The SolarWinds hackers launched attacks from systems run by  Microsoft  and Amazon. The National Security Agency, which has primary responsibility for protecting cyberspace, is legally barred from monitoring and collecting intelligence from U.S. entities. Tom Burt, Microsoft’s vice president for security, told the Journal in March: “This is a sophisticated actor that apparently took time to research legal authority. It knew that by operating from servers in the United States, it could evade some of the U.S. government’s best threat hunters.”</td>

Message boards for the stock are mostly filled with banter about the cryptocurrency, not the company.<br />“We’ve definitely seen a massive increase on a percentage basis in mistaken activity on the Ethan Allen stream,” says Rishi Khanna, Chief Executive Officer of social investing site Stocktwits.<br />The confusion persists despite ribbing by other posters. On Yahoo Finance, for example: “$ETH to the moon!—give us something to sit in when we get there!” And: “In the year 2030, all transactions will be settled digitally with Ethan Allen interiors stock.”<br />With some novice investors buying first and asking questions later, it might even have spilled over into actual purchases. Turnover for Ethan Allen in the past month is 56% above its five-year average. That might not be a bad thing.

But now its decades-old struggle with the Palestinians has come to the fore once again.<br />Officials from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco—all countries that normalized ties with Israel in 2020—have criticized Israeli policies this week. Even proponents of the accords recognize the deepening challenge for Israel to win acceptance in a region where its occupation of Palestinian territory is deeply unpopular.<br />“Israel right now is putting its friends and partners, including the U.A.E., in a difficult situation, an awkward position,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a prominent Emirati political scientist. “I think this will take us back to square zero.”<br />When entering the Abraham Accords last year, Gulf officials had argued that new diplomatic relationships would give their countries more leverage to convince Israel to change its policies toward Palestinians. Even Saudi Arabia was edging toward recognizing Israel as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmansecretly met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But the current crisis has called that argument into question, observers say.</td>

      <td>COUNTLESS MONUMENTAL acts of nature roost within the Rocky Mountains. If you’re pressed for time but eager to gorge on scenic beauty and intriguing mountain towns, we’ve devised a three-day road trip setting out from Denver and ending in Grand Junction. A few pointers: Some of the best spots sit at the end of rocky roads; opt for four-wheel drive. Cellphone reception can’t cross over every peak; make sure your maps are printed or downloaded in advance. This region can be highly seasonal; visit between now and the end of September before some places flip from bustling to boarded-up.<br />Breakfast from Crema Coffee House (cremacoffeehouse.net) fuels the 2-hour-15-minute launch out of Denver’s orbit and into the mountains toward Buena Vista (“BYOO-nuh Vista” if you want to blend in). Along the Arkansas River, the town is a jumping-in point for kayakers, white-water rafters and stand-up paddleboarders (which is why you see so many signs asking you “SUP?”). If the rapids look too rapid, stroll instead along the banks in South Main, a meticulous neighborhood of gabled homes and shops that feels slightly staged but nonetheless stylish. Pop into the bar at the Surf Hotel, which anchors the area, for a refreshment on the wraparound balcony that overlooks the river (surfhotel.com).<br />Bid goodbye to Buena Vista and head south on Highway 285. Turn west toward Mount Princeton Hot Springs Resort for a creekside geothermal soak (mtprinceton.com; day passes available). Next up: the ghost town of St Elmo, a late-1800s mining community that dried up when the railroad did, leaving behind a row of weathered wood structures fit for a Spaghetti Western.<br />Plan to bunk down for the night farther south in Salida at the Amigo Motor Lodge, a chic update of a ’50s roadside motel that brought in a few refurbished Airstream trailers (from $115 a night, stayamigo.com). After checking in, head to the town’s brick-and-mural-lined historic district, stopping for Howl Mercantile and Coffee’s cabin-cozy ceramics (howlmercantile.com) and the Museum of Authenticity, with its exceptional collection of Greek folk art and works by Colorado artists (museumofauthenticity.org).<br />Show no restraint when selecting your breakfast items at Salida’s Little Red Hen Bakery (littleredhensalida.com). The drive west over Monarch Pass offers a panorama of the Sawatch mountain range as you cross the Continental Divide, the boundary that decides whether a river flows east or west. Continue on to Crested Butte, carved with plenty of hiking and biking paths. During the Crested Butte Wildflower Festival, July 9-18, local guides lead walks to the lushest spots, including the Rustler Gulch and Beckwith Pass trails (crestedbuttewildflowerfestival.org). Back in town, brightly painted buildings along Elk Avenue host convivial places such as Secret Stash (secretstash.com), which serves cheeky pizzas like the Booty Call (a heap of meat).</td>

      <td>Chinese e-commerce company has managed to come out of an eventful year in a good shape, but the competition is hot on its heels</td>
      <td>Chinese regulators recently slapped a $2.8 billion fine on Alibaba. But the company actually has a larger problem: maintaining its lead over the competition.<br />The Chinese e-commerce giant reported an operating loss of $1.2 billion for the quarter ending in March. The loss was mostly because Alibaba booked the $2.8 billion fine for anticompetitive behavior in that quarter. Excluding the fine, Alibaba’s operating profit would have risen 48% from a year earlier. Regulators say the company forced merchants to sell goods exclusively on its platform instead of those of its rivals, in a practice called er xuan yi, meaning “choose one out of two.”<br />It was a difficult year for Alibaba regulator-wise—its finance affiliate Ant Group saw its initial public offering derailed—but it has been a great year for business. Alibaba’s e-commerce and cloud businesses benefited from the pandemic. Revenue last quarter grew 64% from a year earlier. Partly that was due to the addition of Sun Art, a supermarket chain Alibaba acquired last year, but even excluding that, its sales grew 40%.<br />But the company needs to invest more to fend off the competition. With the latest regulatory scrutiny, it might also need to spend more to keep merchants happy. The company’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which excludes the one-off fine, grew only 18% year-over-year—implying shrinking margins. Alibaba has been putting money into food delivery and grocery e-commerce. The latter in particular faces strong competition from others as all Chinese tech giants see this as a chance to get their hands on relatively untapped rural areas. The business is unlikely to be profitable in the near future.<br />Apart from usual rivals  JD.com  and Pinduoduo, Alibaba could face competition from Tencent. Tencent’s  WeChat  has increasingly become a platform for shopping through its mini-programs, basically apps within the chat app. Merchants and even e-commerce platforms like JD.com can do their businesses through these mini-programs. Tencent said in January gross merchandise sales for physical goods on mini-programs last year grew 154% from a year earlier, without indicating the actual amount.</td>

      <td>TEL AVIV—Israel struck more targets in Gaza on Thursday in what officials said was a campaign against Hamas militants, as the government scrambled to contain escalating communal violence within its own borders.<br />Since Monday, Israel has struck 600 targets that it described as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad weaponry and infrastructure, and killed more than 30 militants, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman. Of those, more than 10 were senior leaders in the group, he said.<br />Among the recent targets were several Hamas buildings, including what it said was an intelligence office in the upscale Rimal neighborhood, the home of a battalion commander and two branches of Hamas’s main bank. Israel also struck a squad operating antitank missiles, the military said.<br />The strikes have killed more than 83 people in Gaza, including 17 children, according to Palestinian officials. Six Israelis, including one child, have been killed in the rocket fire from Gaza, while one soldier was killed by an antitank missile, according to Israeli authorities.<br />Col. Conricus said Israel is also advancing plans for a ground maneuver for later review by Israel’s political leaders, but no decision has been made yet.</td>

      <td>Public opinion surveys ahead of the 2020 presidential election were the most inaccurate in 40 years, according to an expert panel convened by the main trade group for pollsters, which said its work hadn’t yet pointed to a way to correct the error.<br />In the aggregate, the panel said, polls overstated support for Democratic nominee Joe Biden by 3.9 percentage points in the national popular vote in the final two weeks of the campaign. That was a larger error than the 1.3-point overstatement in 2016 surveys for Hillary Clinton, who won the popular vote but lost in the Electoral College.<br />It was the most substantial error in polling since 1980, when surveys found it hard to measure the size of Ronald Reagan’s impending landslide and overstated support for President Jimmy Carter by 6 percentage points.<br />The 2020 polls overstated Democratic support “in every type of contest we looked at: the national popular vote, the state-level presidential vote as well as senatorial and gubernatorial elections,’’ said Joshua D. Clinton, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University who led the review for the American Association for Public Opinion Research.<br />“This was true no matter how respondents were polled. It didn’t matter whether you’re doing online or telephone polls. A similar level of error was pervasive,’’ said Mr. Clinton.</td>

      <td>White House is lobbying companies to back Biden’s plan, but many of them want the administration to find other ways to pay for it</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—In private talks with dozens of business leaders, Biden administration officials are pitching the president’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal as an investment they will benefit from, emphasizing support for new job-training programs as much as better roads, officials and executives say.<br />Some have suggested alternative ways to fund infrastructure projects, while others haven’t offered specifics. Several executives and business groups have said they are eager for Mr. Biden to fulfill a pledge to seek compromise with Republican lawmakers—some of whom have proposed a narrower infrastructure package funded by gas taxes and other user fees, not corporate tax increases. Several Senate Republicans are meeting with Mr. Biden at the White House on Thursday to explore a possible deal.<br />“It’s sort of confusing to me what the policy goal is here,”  Eli Lilly  & Co. Chief Executive David Ricks said in an interview. “Industry drives a huge amount of capital spending and private infrastructure. Taxing that seems like a bad idea when we try to recover the economy.” A spokesman said the company is waiting to see more details on the plan before further comment on how it should be paid for.<br />Following the 2017 corporate tax cuts, Indianapolis-based Lilly boosted its capital spending in the U.S., including construction of a new drug plant in North Carolina. Lilly said it is the company’s first new U.S. plant since 2006 when it built facilities in Puerto Rico and Indiana. “Now we have to reconsider all those things if they raise the rates,” Mr. Ricks said.<br />The issue was a common topic on earnings calls in recent weeks.</td>

      <td>Issues like the semiconductor shortage are pushing up prices. Investing in production can be a better way to deal with inflation than interest-rate rises.</td>
      <td>Does inflation always lead to high interest rates? Washington’s semiconductor ambitions point to a more logical policy response.<br />Inflation is back. The U.S. consumer-price index surged to a 13-year high of 4.2% in April, official data showed Wednesday. The eurozone’s figure is a weaker 1.6%, but still a two-year high. The global bond market isn’t panicking yet. The pandemic led many distressed companies to slash prices in 2020. Investors always knew that, as the economy reopened, some year-over-year increases would be huge.<br />The prices of most products haven’t changed much. CPI gyrations are mostly down to a few items particularly affected by lockdowns and travel restrictions, such as airfares and restaurant prices, as well as commodities. Excluding food and energy, U.S. inflation in April was just 3%.<br />One inflation driver stood out in Wednesday’s data: The global shortage of semiconductors. Partly because it is impairing production of new cars, the prices of used autos jumped 10% in April from the previous month—accounting for over a third of the all-items increase.<br />To cool the used-car economy by raising rates and inflicting pain elsewhere would make little sense. Instead, the Biden administration seeks to fix the chip shortage by investing $50 billion in onshore semiconductor production capacity. The plans will take time and are still underfunded, but they help understand that the best way to fight chip inflation is to make more chips.</td>

      <td>The move to suspend patents on Covid-19 vaccines opens up a major risk to the way the drug industry does business</td>
      <td>The decision by the Biden administration to support a temporary waiver on patents for Covid-19 vaccines might not end up costing the drug industry a dime, but investors who make that assumption are playing a dangerous game.<br />It remains uncertain whether the World Trade Organization will approve the vaccine waiver, not least because the European Union has been cool to the idea. At a minimum, though, U.S. support for the waiver reignited debate over a popular drug-industry talking point: The regulatory environment in the U.S., characterized by the defense of intellectual-property rights and the absence of government price controls, helps attract funding for drug research and engenders scientific breakthroughs.<br />That engenders controversy in Washington, but there is no doubt that the current regulations help make the industry attractive in the eyes of Wall Street. After all, new drugs that reach the market enjoy years of exclusivity before cheaper competitors are allowed to arrive. Drugs that fill a significant unmet medical need can make patients healthy and investors rich:  Moderna  shareholders have earned about five times their money since March 2020, thanks mainly to its successful Covid-19 vaccine development. Moderna said last week that it expects to book nearly $20 billion in vaccine sales in 2021. In the first quarter, it reported a profit margin of about 63%.<br />The industry faces its share of pitfalls as well. The vast majority of experimental drugs never reach the market due to safety or efficacy issues—a risk that can’t simply be legislated away. What is more, development is expensive and even successful drugs usually take several years to reach the market in a non-pandemic environment. Government funding can help underwrite some drug research, but large pools of private capital are still required.<br />Lone blockbuster medicines make up a large share of sales even at the biggest companies. Sales of the anti-inflammatory drug Humira accounted for 38% of  AbbVie ’s  top line in the first quarter, while sales of the cancer drug Keytruda made up a third of total revenue at  Merck  & Co.</td>

      <td>TOKYO— SoftBank Group Corp.  is pulling back from an investment unit it set up last year whose bets on publicly traded technology stocks were so large they earned the Japanese investor the nickname “Nasdaq whale.”<br />The unit, named SB Northstar, had been investing billions of dollars in stocks like  Facebook Inc.  and  Amazon.com Inc.,  sometimes using derivatives called options to increase the size of its bets. For a time, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son personally directed the trades himself, using a $20 billion pot of cash.<br />But the unit ended up losing money and was roundly booed by investors. During the fiscal year ended in March, it lost the equivalent of $5.6 billion on its derivatives transactions, according to a SoftBank financial filing. On Wednesday, after SoftBank reported a record $46 billion in profit, Mr. Son told investors on earnings calls that the company would scale back SB Northstar and direct investment firepower instead to SoftBank’s latest startup fund, Vision Fund 2, according to people familiar with the calls.<br />“The majority of my heart and soul is in the Vision Fund,” Mr. Son said, according to one of those people.<br />Mr. Son didn’t say how much SoftBank would reduce SB Northstar’s fund size. As of the end of March, the unit was holding nearly $20 billion in stocks including  Microsoft Corp. , Facebook and Amazon. It had around $1.6 billion in derivatives tied to roughly $13 billion worth of shares, according to SoftBank filings.</td>

      <td>Latest census results signal that Beijing faces the risk of declining growth unless it makes changes to policies discouraging births and immigration</td>
      <td>The results of a once-a-decade census present China and its president, Xi Jinping, with a stark choice: Unwind party controls on family planning and immigration, or stick with the policies and risk declining economic growth.<br />On Tuesday, China’s government said births dropped for a fourth consecutive year in 2020 and the overall rate of population growth slowed to a near halt, with the total number of people edging up to 1.41 billion. Nearly 20% of citizens are age 60 or over.<br />Wang Feng, a sociology professor at the University of California, Irvine, expects China’s population to begin to fall within five years. “It’s going to be a decline that sees no end,” he said.<br />Stagnating population growth, even for crowded China, translates into fewer younger people to generate economic power as rising numbers of elderly represent a net drain on finances. It is the reverse of the demographic profile that underpinned China’s economic miracle, essentially a surge in productivity driven by an endless supply of cheap labor.<br />Demographers for years have called on China’s political leaders to eliminate controls on family size, including a two-baby limit, and push back retirement ages that can be as low as 50 for women and 60 for men. Welcoming young foreign immigrants could create a pool of labor and fresh growth impetus. But China has resisted immigration, and controls over people’s individual lives are hallmarks of Communist Party rule. It was a monumental climb down for the party in 2015 when it eased the one-child policy set by then-leader Deng Xiaoping more than three decades earlier and widely regarded as outdated.</td>

Instead, a decade ago the NCAA handed off its sponsorship program to CBS and Turner Sports as part of the broadcasting deal for the men’s basketball tournament.<br />CBS and Turner make a fixed annual payment—currently $850 million—to the NCAA that increases each year. The networks make most of their money from that deal by selling ads for the men’s basketball tournament.<br />But they also control the rights to sell sponsorships for all NCAA-run sports championships—a sideline that this year brought in roughly $211 million, according to an estimate by the IEG Sponsorship Intelligence Database. As stipulated in the NCAA contract, CBS and Turner keep that sponsorship revenue.</td>

Investors should take a second look now that they are in the bargain bin.<br />After a resilient 2020,  Poshmark  and luxury consignor  RealReal  are experiencing brisk business this year. In the first quarter, RealReal saw gross merchandise value, a measure of total sales through its platform, grow 27% compared with a year earlier and 8.6% compared with the prior quarter. Poshmark reported on Wednesday that its gross merchandise value grew 43% compared with a year earlier or 14% compared with the prior quarter. Both exceeded consensus analyst estimates, according to FactSet.<br />In the first quarter, Poshmark saw its customers seek aspirational items, as they dreamed of a more normal summer. Top-performing search categories in March included crop tops, which saw searches double compared with a year earlier, and bikinis, which are seeing searches up 87%.<br />Luxury buyers seem to be moving at a slower pace: RealReal said in its earnings call that shoppers continued to buy a higher mix of wardrobe staples such as handbags, watches and fine jewelry rather than apparel in the first quarter. That has weighed on RealReal’s profitability because the company takes a lower cut of sales on those items compared with apparel. Partly because of that, gross profit per unit was flat at $85 in the first quarter, the same as a year earlier.<br />Despite the better-than-expected top line performance, both companies’ shares took a beating after their results. RealReal’s shares dipped 19% on Tuesday after its Monday afternoon earnings release. Poshmark’s shares were down 11% in after-hour trading following its earnings call on Wednesday. Both companies’ shares have roughly halved in value since their respective market debuts.</td>

The Bloomberg Short Term Bank Yield Index competes with the alternative preferred by regulators including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.<br />The transaction between the two large Wall Street firms marks a shift in the yearslong plan to move away from the troubled rate underpinning trillions of dollars in financial contracts, with some analysts now saying multiple benchmarks are likely to replace Libor instead of just one. Libor underpins trillions of dollars worth of financial contracts and is scheduled for replacement at the end of 2021 in the wake of a manipulation scandal.<br />The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, consisting of major banks, insurers and asset managers working alongside the New York Fed, have been rallying investors and companies to move to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. While large banks and mortgage lenders like Fannie Mae have started actively using the benchmark, some large U.S. corporations and other borrowers held off, seeking a benchmark that could fix rates over longer time spans.<br />Bankers said clients are using the Bloomberg index because the ARCC has been slow to roll out those forward-looking reference rates.

We will start to see more hiring.”<br />Higher vaccination rates, fiscal stimulus and easing business restrictions are converging to support stronger spending across the U.S. But job growth isn’t keeping pace. U.S. employers added a modest 266,000 jobs in April, far short of the one million that economists had forecast and the weakest monthly gain since January.<br />Many employers say they cannot find enough workers to meet surging demand, in turn limiting production. Economists cite several factors keeping workers on the sidelines, including expanded $300 unemployment benefits, individuals’ fear of contracting Covid-19 and child-care burdens due to school closures.</td>

      <td>The indiscriminate slump in Taiwan’s stock market demonstrates that sometimes flows overwhelm fundamental analysis, an increasing risk as stock buyers take on more leverage</td>
      <td>Taiwan boasts the best-performing stock market of any MSCI index in either the developed or emerging-market universe since the beginning of 2020. This week a sharp selloff brought it close to losing that crown.<br />The plunge is a classic story of exuberance and leverage, with lessons for investors in the U.S. and beyond.<br />The immediate cause was apparently Taiwan’s worst outbreak of Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. Sixteen locally transmitted cases blotted a largely stainless record of keeping the island basically quarantined from the rest of the world.<br />The market boom since March last year has encouraged ever more investors to take on margin debt, which has risen to its highest level in around a decade. Margin debt magnifies selloffs, because investors whose brokerage accounts are displaying losses are asked to post more collateral—a margin call—and have to sell more stocks to raise the cash in response.<br />That explains the breadth of the selloff on Wednesday in particular. At one point, the Taiex index was down by around 9%, taking with it pretty much every company regardless of its exposure to the domestic economy. Take the case of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chip maker, which has been an enormous beneficiary of the massive demand for semis world-wide. It nonetheless tumbled by a similar amount.</td>

He will be permitted to testify about matters referenced in the public portion of Mr. Mueller’s report.

It is also likely to ease frustrations among airlines that had planned to use their 737 MAX planes as travel demand picks up, following a sharp decline due to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Once the electrical fixes are completed, the 109 affected jets, or about a quarter of the global MAX fleet, will be able to return to passenger service after being grounded since early April, according to industry and FAA officials. The fixes outlined in service bulletins to airlines are expected to take a few days per plane to complete, Boeing executives have said.<br />U.S. airlines have been hoping to have their grounded MAX jets flying again by Memorial Day weekend, in time for the busy summer travel season, industry officials said.<br />Late Wednesday, a Boeing spokeswoman said the company would work with airlines to complete the repairs while it prepares to resume deliveries.</td>

Here is what you need to know about the bankruptcy case, and next steps the NRA may take.<br />When the NRA filed for bankruptcy in January, it said the chapter 11 case was part of a broader strategic plan to reincorporate in Texas, a friendlier jurisdiction for gun rights advocacy where the nonprofit has a significant number of members.<br />The bankruptcy case was filed months after the New York Attorney General Letitia James sued the NRA in August, seeking to dissolve the organization and accusing Mr. LaPierre and other top officers of corruption and financial mismanagement, allegations he and the NRA have denied.<br />Although the NRA is based in Virginia, the organization has been domiciled in New York since its formation in 1871, and is regulated by that state’s nonprofit laws and authorities.<br />When the NRA filed for chapter 11, the group said that it was doing so “to exit what it believes is a corrupt political and regulatory environment in New York.” Lawyers for the New York attorney general pointed to that statement during the bankruptcy trial as evidence the NRA filed bankruptcy in bad faith and to gain an unfair advantage in their litigation. NRA officials also admitted on the witness stand that they didn’t believe New York courts were corrupt.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden on Wednesday ordered U.S. agencies and software contractors that supply them to boost their defenses against cyberattacks that officials say pose a growing threat to national security and public safety.<br />The president signed an executive order that establishes baseline cybersecurity standards for U.S. agencies and their software contractors, including mandates to use multi-factor authentication and data encryption, and that requires federal information technology vendors to disclose certain data about hacks.<br />The order also establishes a cybersecurity safety review board, to be led by a mix of government and private-sector cybersecurity experts. The board will be empowered to investigate significant cyber intrusions and publish security recommendations. The board is modeled loosely on the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates airplane crashes and other transit failures, officials said.<br />The new order is intended to reorient the federal government’s approach to cybersecurity around prevention rather than crisis response, a senior administration official said. It came as Colonial Pipeline Co. restarted its 5,500-mile conduit—a major source of fuel throughout the East Coast—late Wednesday afternoon. The pipeline was taken offline on Friday in response to a cyberattack.<br />The order was written largely before that hack was disclosed and doesn’t specifically address critical infrastructure cybersecurity, like the energy grid or gas and oil pipelines.</td>

Its shares have fallen nearly 38% from where they opened on the company’s Feb. 11 initial public offering. Wednesday’s first quarter results didn’t do much to rekindle investors’ love: The stock traded flat after hours after losing 6% on the day.<br />On paper, things look pretty enchanting: Bumble said revenue for both its namesake Bumble app and Badoo came in above Wall Street’s expectations for the quarter, as did total paying users. Second quarter and full-year guidance for revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization at the midpoint also beat analysts’ forecasts.<br />Taken on its own, those numbers sure make it sound like a keeper. But online dating is all about the next best swipe and, at 11 times forward sales, the case for Bumble still looks overvalued, even at a slight discount to its more mature peer  Match Group .<br />It comes down to shots on goal. While it operates the number two dating app in the world in Bumble, the company has just two dating apps. Match has more than 10 brands under its umbrella, including Tinder, the highest grossing dating app in the world; Pairs is the largest dating app in Japan, and Hinge tripled its revenue last year and is on pace to double it again, according to Match.<br />Ultimately, if you are betting on dating as the world opens up, Match simply has a larger grip on the market. It also beat Wall Street’s forecasts for the first quarter, even while one of its most significant markets in India remains highly challenged due to a recent spike in Covid-19 cases.</td>

U.S. officials have linked the attack to a criminal gang known as DarkSide.<br />“Colonial will move as much gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel as is safely possible and will continue to do so until markets return to normal,” the company said in a statement.<br />It previously said that it had restarted some smaller segments of the pipeline system by operating them manually, while its main line remained shut down.

No one was injured, and the flight landed safely.<br />The progress in developing a fix for the engine covers comes as  United Airlines Holdings Inc.  hopes to return to service certain Boeing 777 jets that are powered by Pratt & Whitney engines. Boeing’s fix is expected to include metal components that would strengthen the engine covers, people familiar with the matter said.<br />United took 24 of the jets out of service after the Denver incident, and U.S. air-safety regulators ordered immediate inspections of those engines’ blades for cracks that could potentially lead to failures and their covers detaching. United has said it had another 28 of the jets with Pratt & Whitney engines in storage. Other carriers that operate 777s with those engines include South Korean and Japanese airlines.</td>

      <td>The Fed Chairman wanted higher prices. Lets hope it’s ‘transitory.’</td>
      <td>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s inflation ship has come in, albeit more rudely than he probably wanted. The consumer price index rose a remarkable 4.2% at an annual rate in April, and 3% in the core measure that excludes food and energy. Mr. Powell wanted more inflation, and now he’s got it.<br />The surge in prices won’t surprise most Americans, who have been paying more everywhere from the grocery store to cars to the housing market. Prices in April rose across the board, but especially for goods and services in lower demand during the lockdowns. Hotel prices increased 8.8% for the month and 8.1% year-over-year. The monthly increase of 0.9% less food and energy was the largest since 1982.<br />As vaccines roll out, more people are going out and spending their savings and stimulus checks. Demand is increasing at the same time supply problems frustrate businesses. Used car and truck prices jumped 10%, which accounted for a third of the month’s CPI increase. One reason: New car production has slowed amid a global computer chip shortage. But that’s no consolation to middle-class Americans who buy used cars. The rich buy new Teslas.<br />Commodities have also been surging and are feeding into consumer prices. Corn prices are up 50% this year and some 125% year-over-year. Overall food prices climbed 0.4% from March and 2.4% over the past 12 months. Fresh produce and meat prices rose even more.<br />A worker shortage is also pushing up wages—average hourly earnings rose 0.7% in April—and may be starting to feed into higher consumer prices. Many small businesses were reluctant to pass on their increasing cost of goods and labor when demand was lower. But that may now be changing as consumers are spending more freely.</td>

The post doesn’t require Senate confirmation, but it can play a role in election-related investigations and enforcement.<br />Ms. Hennessey made her name as a commentator by hyping Russian collusion allegations. A former National Security Agency lawyer, she bestowed phony credibility on the Steele dossier after the 2016 election. In 2017 she wrote that the unlawful leak of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador “posed a countervailing set of extraordinary circumstances.” She tweeted in 2019 that the decision to drop charges against Mr. Flynn was “an astonishing assault on the rule of law.”<br />Ms. Hennessey has an undisguised partisan interest in the Russia probe, which is still being investigated by U.S. Attorney John Durham. After the 2020 election, Ms. Hennessey tweeted that Mr. Durham’s work was “partisan silliness.”<br />Then there’s the investigation of Rudy Giuliani, who was recently the target of search warrants, apparently over dealings in Ukraine. Leaks to the press—perhaps from Justice—claimed falsely that the FBI had briefed him on a Russian disinformation campaign. Ms. Hennessey is the wrong person to be anywhere near these investigations, or anything that involves her miles-long list of people she loathes.</td>

      <td>Ousting Liz Cheney doesn’t end the GOP’s 2022 election problems.</td>

They can’t win without his voters, but they also will struggle to win if the former President dominates the party and insists on re-fighting the 2020 election for the next four years.<br />Ms. Cheney was purged on a voice vote that was so overwhelming that no one even asked for a recorded tally. Her offense was challenging—too vocally for GOP comfort—Mr. Trump’s claims that the 2020 election was stolen and that the attempt to overturn the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6 was constitutional and warranted.<br />Many Republicans privately agree with Liz Cheney on both points, but they don’t want to get into a public fight with Mr. Trump. They want House leaders to focus on resisting the Biden agenda, and they think Ms. Cheney’s insistence on publicly rebutting Mr. Trump’s falsehoods was a distraction. She can now say what she wants as a backbencher.<br />But the GOP problem is less that Ms. Cheney won’t let Mr. Trump go than that Mr. Trump won’t let 2020 go. He can’t accept that he lost, so he’s busy rewriting history to convince everyone he was cheated. He’s making that claim a litmus test for GOP leaders or for candidates who want his endorsement.<br />That may please the Trump base but it won’t appeal to the swing voters the GOP needs to retake the House and Senate. Mr. Trump’s claim that he was cheated in November is the main reason the GOP lost two Georgia Senate seats in the Jan. 5 runoff. Trump voters stayed home after Mr. Trump told them their votes didn’t count. The pre-election polling and voter turnout couldn’t be clearer about this. Joe Biden’s agenda would be stalled now if Mr. Trump had put the party first after his defeat.</td>

      <td>Biden considers another waiver, but the real answer is to sink it.</td>
      <td>Every time America suffers a disaster that harms fuel distribution, we get a fresh reminder of the high price America pays for the 1920 Jones Act. So it is with the gas shortages caused by a cyber attack that last Friday shut down the Colonial Pipeline, which supplies roughly 45% of gasoline and oil for the East Coast. On Wednesday the Biden Administration said it “stands ready” to consider requests from shippers for a Jones Act waiver to allow more ships to transport fuel where it’s needed.<br />The Jones Act is a protectionist’s dream, requiring that any vessel transporting goods between U.S. ports must be American-built, manned and owned. The result is higher costs for everyone, and perverse inefficiencies such as making it cheaper for New England to import liquefied natural gas from places such as Trinidad and Tobago rather than from the Gulf Coast.<br />That’s why in a crisis Presidents rely on waivers. George W. Bush granted a waiver after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Barack Obama did it after Hurricane Sandy. Donald Trump did it after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.<br />The obvious question is why the U.S. keeps the law if it has to be suspended so often. The higher costs and inefficiencies don’t go away when the crisis does. The answer is that, like most protectionist legislation, the few who benefit want to keep it this way.<br />Mr. Trump found this out the hard way. At one point after Hurricane Maria he was considering a request from the Governor of Puerto Rico for a 10-year Jones Act waiver for LNG shipments. He abandoned the idea after a meeting with Republican politicians who vigorously opposed it.</td>

Cory Booker (D., N.J.) made a few big mistakes when he asked Tuesday, “Will we let today’s Republican Party revive Jim Crow, seize partisan control over how elections are run, and impose permanent undemocratic control of government?”<br />First, it dishonors those who fought real Jim Crow laws to suggest GOP voting reforms are synonymous with the effort—perpetrated by many white Southern Democrats—from the 1870s through the mid-20th century to wipe out black voting rights through poll taxes, literacy tests, and often violence and intimidation.<br />Second, Mr. Booker’s interest in election law is curiously recent. He never made voting reform a priority in any of the eight campaigns he’s conducted since 1998, though New Jersey has long had one of America’s more restrictive election regimes. Only this fall, for instance, will the Garden State start allowing in-person early voting, and for about half as many days as Georgia will.<br />Mr. Booker’s behavior seems to be the rule, not the exception, among Democrats these days. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also attacked Republicans Tuesday: “We are witnessing an attempt at the greatest contraction of voting rights since the end of Reconstruction and the beginning of Jim Crow,” he said. Hmmm. New York allowed early voting for the first time in 2020, but only for nine days, again about half the minimum period required in Georgia. And the Empire State hasn’t yet finally approved universal no-excuse mail-in ballots. Like the senator from New Jersey, Mr. Schumer never made his state’s restrictive voting laws a focus in any of his 16 campaigns since 1974.<br />But back to Mr. Booker. His accusation that the GOP wants to take permanent control of government undemocratically is a classic example of projection. That’s exactly what congressional Democrats seem to be trying to accomplish with S.1, the so-called For the People Act.</td>

      <td>BlackRock and others bill the cost to middle-income investors, in the form of lower returns.</td>
      <td>Workers with pensions or 401(k)s trust financial institutions to make the best investments for their retirement incomes. An increasing number of portfolio managers say they maximize returns with their Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance, or ESG, investment criteria. But is that true, and is it the proper role of financial institutions?<br />A recent analysis by Scientific Beta disputes “claims that ESG funds have tended to outperform the wider market.” Sony Kapoor, managing director of the Nordic Institute for Finance, Technology and Sustainability, a think tank, told the Financial Times that the research “puts in black and white what is only whispered in the corridors of finance—most ESG investing is a ruse to launder reputations, maximize fees and assuage guilt.”<br />BlackRock ’s  former chief investment officer for sustainable investing, Tariq Fancy, appears to understand this. He recently wrote in USA Today that he was concerned about portfolio managers exploiting the “E” of ESG investing because “claiming to be environmentally responsible is profitable” but advancing “real change in the environment simply doesn’t yield the same return.” Mr. Fancy criticized “stalling and greenwashing” in “the name of profits.”<br />This is a tacit admission that ESG investing upends the fiduciary duties portfolio managers owe their clients. As Mr. Fancy acknowledged, “no matter what they tout as green investing, portfolio managers are legally bound” to “do nothing that compromises profits.” As former Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia wrote on these pages last year, under the federal law that protects retirement assets, known as Erisa, “one ‘social’ goal trumps all others—retirement security for American workers.”<br />No one should be surprised when portfolio managers pay lip service to ESG investment criteria while in practice looking for companies that will generate higher profits. To the extent portfolio managers use ESG to justify investing in companies that are less profitable than alternatives, they are imposing a tax on their clients in the form of reduced returns. But shareholders don’t agree to pay this tax, and most have no idea the extent to which it’s being imposed.</td>

      <td>Savvy bargaining has gotten them handsome benefits and six-figure salaries.</td>
      <td>Being a lifeguard isn’t easy, but in Los Angeles it can be lucrative. Auditors at OpenTheBooks.com found 82 county lifeguards earning at least $200,000 including benefits and seven making between $300,000 and $392,000. Thirty-one lifeguards made between $50,000 and $131,000 in overtime alone.<br />After 30 years of service, they can retire as young as 55 on 79% of their pay. The Los Angeles County Lifeguard Association makes all this possible. Since 1995 the union has bargained for better wages, hours, benefits and working conditions.<br />Over the past five years, lifeguard captain Daniel Douglas brought home $630,000 in overtime alone. His total employment costs in 2019 were $368,668—$140,706 base bay, $131,493 in overtime, $21,760 in “other pay” and $74,709 in benefits.<br />In 2009 the city of Santa Monica signed a 10-year, $25 million contract with the county for lifeguard services. In 2019 the city extended the contract for five years and $17 million. There were no identified competitors and the contract wasn’t put out for bid.<br />To be sure, being a lifeguard isn’t all fun in the sun: Some are EMTs and paramedics, and some are part of an underwater recovery team and participate in diving operations. Some are marine firefighters with specialized training for fireboat operations. Some are on duty for 24 hours at a time—though they’re allotted eight hours for sleep, and if they have a call that interrupts their slumber after five hours or less, “the entire 24-hour period shall be counted as hours worked,” the contract states.</td>

      <td>Representing a young nation, the ship descended on Antarctica. The crew made 20 landings before getting stuck in the ice.</td>
      <td>On Aug. 16, 1897, 20,000 Belgians lined the wharves of Antwerp to wave off the Belgica, a 113-foot three-masted steam whaler. She was departing for Antarctica, still a land of fable in the last years of the 19th century. Belgium had declared independence from Holland only 67 years earlier, and with the voyage of the Belgica, writes Julian Sancton, the young nation “was staking a claim to the next frontier of human exploration.”<br />“Madhouse at the End of the Earth” tells the story of the Belgian Antarctic expedition. Mr. Sancton, an American journalist who visited Antarctica for his research, structures his tale around three main characters: Adrien de Gerlache, a Belgian naval officer and the expedition’s leader; Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian polar explorer who served as the Belgica’s first mate; and Frederick Cook, the voyage’s “lone Yankee,” a New York doctor with a “peninsula of a nose.”<br />De Gerlache’s expedition “was sold as a scientific mission, but at its core it was a romantic endeavor.” The Belgian’s goals were to chart the uncharted; collect data on the region’s flora, fauna and geology; and locate the South Magnetic Pole, then thought to lie around the 75th parallel. Only three expeditions had ever sailed south of the 70th. The Belgica made stops in Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo, Uruguay, in October and November, before the men first sighted the Antarctic Peninsula, which extends toward the southern tip of South America, in January 1898. Over two months the crew discovered what is now the Gerlache Strait and made 20 landings, more than all previous expeditions combined. Then the ship traveled southwest and spent more than a year trapped in the Bellingshausen Sea.<br />Cook had joined the Belgica in Rio, having offered his services as the expedition’s doctor. He had been in Greenland with the American explorer Robert Peary in 1891-92, and was “famous among polar enthusiasts worldwide.” With Cook on board, the Belgica carried 14 Belgians, 11 foreigners and two cats. Before the expedition reached the ice, desertions and dismissals tipped the balance in favor of the non-Belgians.<br />Mr. Sancton conjures the fug of pipe smoke and unwashed men in the unventilated wardroom, the taste of kjøttboller—spongy canned meatballs resembling “soft, colorless gobs”—and the pearly sheen of fluted icebergs. Cook, who took a genuine interest in the well-being of every man aboard, quickly became “the most popular member of the expedition.” Mr. Sancton is pro-Cook throughout these pages, even when the man’s records are unreliable.</td>

Model 3 on Interstate 80 in the Bay Area. Mr. Sharma couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.<br />Police said they had received 911 calls about the driver. The officer in Wednesday’s arrest saw the driver, the lone occupant of the car, seated in the back seat, police said. Mr. Sharma moved to the driver’s seat and stopped the car on the shoulder of the interstate, where he was arrested, the police said.<br />Mr. Sharma was charged with two counts of reckless driving and disobeying an officer. He also was cited with using his vehicle in a reckless manner last month, the police said.<br />The incident is the latest to raise questions about how some Tesla drivers use their vehicles, including the advanced driver-assistance features the company offers.</td>

That figure is 38% higher than the 2019 average rate of 8.2 incidents of force per 100 inmates. Just over half of the incidents had either procedural errors or involved avoidable or problematic force, according to the report.<br />While some use-of-force tactics have been curtailed, the report said, the federal monitor Steve Martin and his team were concerned about the overall state of reform within the city’s Department of Correction, which runs the Rikers Island jail complex and other city detention centers. “The pervasive level of disorder and chaos in the Facilities is alarming,” the report said.<br />Mr. Martin was appointed a monitor to oversee overhaul efforts at city jails as part of a 2015 settlement of a civil-rights lawsuit over alleged abuses at the jail complex.<br />As part of his appointment, Mr. Martin is tasked with producing reports on efforts to improve jail conditions. His latest report, submitted to a federal judge on Tuesday, was the 11th about city jails.</td>

      <td>When do big concerts return? It’s a complicated picture right now as some musicians sell out shows and others postpone them yet again. Just last week, Travis Scott’s fall Astroworld Festival sold out quickly, while Justin Bieber delayed his tour to 2022.<br />This summer, the concert business is expected to re-open gradually, thanks to vaccination efforts in the U.S. and U.K. But bigger concerts in arenas and stadiums could take until late summer and fall to gain  momentum. Here’s a guide to what to expect:<br />As more Americans get vaccinated and lockdown restrictions ease, concert tickets are selling briskly, in-person events, often socially-distanced ones, are proliferating and tour announcements are coming in fast. On Tuesday, Phish announced a 2021 tour that launches in July.<br />During an earnings call last Thursday, Michael Rapino, chief executive of  Live Nation Entertainment ,  the world’s biggest concert promoter, said that since February “our confidence has increased for our key markets,” including the U.S. and U.K. He pointed to “artists’ increasing confidence in performing this summer,” noting tours by Dave Matthews Band and Luke Bryan.<br />Just because a date is listed on your favorite performer’s website doesn’t always mean the show will happen.</td>
