      <td>U.S. airlines had their worst year ever in 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, and a rebound in travel remains elusive for now.<br />Southwest Airlines Co.  lost nearly $3.1 billion last year—its first annual loss since 1972, the year after the Dallas-based carrier began flying. The airline lost $908 million during the fourth quarter.<br />American Airlines Group Inc.  reported a record $8.9 billion loss last year, and lost $2.2 billion during the fourth quarter. But losses at both American and Southwest were narrower than analysts expected.<br />Investors sent American’s shares on a wild ride Thursday. Shares soared by more than 80% before the market opened, but later pulled back and ended the day up 9.3% at $18.10. The company was named Wednesday on Reddit’s popular WallStreetBets forum, where retail investors have encouraged one another to pile into stocks with high levels of short interest, prompting extreme share price increases.<br />Shares of Southwest, which hasn’t attracted the same attention from short sellers as American, rose about 1% to $44.60.</td>

Companies are able to save money that in a more traditional IPO would be shelled out to investment banks. This option to go public isn’t as common as traditional IPOs.<br />Data-mining company  Palantir Technologies Inc.  and streaming platform  Spotify Technology SA  both went public through direct listings.<br />Coinbase was started in 2012 and is the biggest exchange for cryptocurrency in the U.S. The San Francisco-based company was recently valued at around $8 billion and has more users than  Charles Schwab Corp.’s  platform.</td>

      <td>An HBO documentary looks under the hood at the life of Elizabeth Carmichael, a transgender woman who launched a fraudulent auto company.</td>
      <td>If the four-part documentary “The Lady and the Dale” were someone you met at a post-pandemic cocktail party, it would be sidling up and saying, “Want to hear a crazy story?” It seems that during the gas shortage of the 1970s there was a woman, see, who came out with a three-wheeled car that got 70 miles to the gallon—it was such a big deal they gave one away on “The Price Is Right.” Of course, the car wasn’t all it appeared to be. For that matter, neither was the woman.<br />Directed by Nick Cammilleri and Zackary Drucker, “The Lady and the Dale” is a lot of stories—about fraud, flight, FBI manhunts, transgender politics, selective prosecution, bias in the media and corruption in the courts. If it were a car, episode 1 would barely be opening the hood. Always in the driver’s seat, however, is G. Elizabeth Carmichael, entrepreneur, who was born Jerry Dean Michael, future career criminal. From kiting checks to counterfeiting U.S. currency, her life as Michael indicated a personality constitutionally incapable of legitimate enterprise. As Carmichael the stakes were higher and the goals more ambitious, but the illicit nature of her efforts was consistent. The series—new episodes of which appear on consecutive Sundays—quite smartly questions why a highly intelligent transgender woman would choose a life of crimes both high and low. It just as smartly answers its own question: When society casts you in the role of outlaw, that just might be how you choose to perform.<br />The Dale, which occupies some but certainly not all of the narrative in “The Lady and the Dale,” was the creation of engineer Dale Clifft, who attached the rear end of a motorcycle with a two-stroke engine to a plastic housing with two front wheels—mostly, he said, so he could ride in the rain. Carmichael saw it as the answer to the OPEC-inflicted gas crisis of 1973 and the instant popularity of smaller, more fuel-efficient automobiles. Evidently brilliant, and audacious, Carmichael didn’t concern herself with the messy details of car manufacturing—or the illegalities involved in collecting deposits on cars never to be built. This led to a sensational nine-month jury trial in Los Angeles in 1976-77. But the series involves much more, and saying almost anything about “The Lady and the Dale” seems like a spoiler, especially as laid out by Mr. Cammilleri, a documentarian, and Ms. Drucker, a transgender artist and LGBT activist.<br />Carmichael’s early story, as Jerry Michael, would make for a tantalizing road movie/caper film. He marries young Vivian Barrett (her brother, Charles Richard Barrett, is one of the series’ more forthcoming interview subjects) and together they lead a life on the lam while raising five kids. The children included Candi Michael, whose recollections are not just astounding, but delivered with no trace of bitterness or regret for not having had a more traditional upbringing—or one in which her family wouldn’t have had to drop everything and flee at the hint of police at the door, something they did routinely. Cataloging the many scams of her dad—whom she eventually came to call mom—Ms. Michael recalls a Jacuzzi-like unit that was supposed to attach to a bathtub and which someone eventually developed legitimately and advertised on television. “That could have been us,” Ms. Michael remembers thinking, “if my father hadn’t been a criminal.”<br />The Michael story becomes the Carmichael story, and with it comes a more sobering assessment of Carmichael’s treatment by the criminal justice system and the L.A. media of the mid-’70s. She’s not an admirable character, except in her brazenness and audacity, but historian Susan Stryker and lawyer Mia Yamamoto argue her position of importance in the cultural and legal history of trans life. The visual approach of “The Lady and the Dale” is a questionable one—the series-long use of cutout animation, aka the stop-motion technique of combining photographs and other visual media to create naïve, collage-like action. It’s an approach too flippant for the subject matter. The filmmakers were likely looking for some way to break up the interview and archival news footage, and create re-enactments without actors. But their use of cutouts ultimately becomes tiresome.</td>

The moves have captivated Wall Street as individual investors take on hedge funds that wagered on declines in those stocks, and big swings in the silver market could add to the frenetic trading.</td>

      <td>Denzel Washington and Rami Malek play cops tracking a serial killer in John Lee Hancock’s grim thriller.</td>
      <td>‘The Little Things,” in theaters and streaming on HBO Max, takes its title from advice that a veteran cop played by Denzel Washington gives to a young homicide detective played by Rami Malek: “It’s the little things that are important, Jimmy. It’s the little things that get you caught.” But the big things are important too—like giving the audience something pleasurable, enjoyable or minimally entertaining to relieve the encompassing gloom and the bilious palette. John Lee Hancock’s crime thriller, set in 1990, is steadfastly glum, a two-hour-plus tour of eroded souls, nighttime freeways, sinister streets, dark alleys, fetid rooms and female corpses perforated by stab wounds. Daylight intrudes from time to time, and a person of interest, played by Jared Leto, finally appears toward the end of the first hour—he’s interesting because he’s eerily playful as well as potentially criminal. For the most part, though, consider this a case of serial crime and unusual punishment. It’s almost no fun at all.<br />That’s more than a disappointment, it’s a bafflement. Why have we been hurled back into David Fincher territory? Not Mr. Fincher’s recent “Mank,” which is drawing-room comedy by comparison, but his definitively dark and intensely memorable “Se7en,” with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as a veteran and a rookie tracking down a depraved serial killer. In fact those tonal resemblances are misleading. Mr. Hancock wrote the first version of this script in 1993, a couple of years before “Se7en” was completed. All the same, what may have been bleakly original way back then isn’t now. It’s hard to watch Mr. Washington, in particular, trying to find some of his usual buoyancy as his character, a world-weary sheriff’s deputy, Joe “Deke” Deacon, pursues a secret agenda with relentless purpose and a heavy heart.<br />The story starts in Kern County, north of Los Angeles, where Deke is working far beneath his talent grade in a rural area near Bakersfield. A local robbery may be connected to a recent crime in L.A., so Deke’s captain sends him down to collect physical evidence after it’s been used in an preliminary hearing. Other connections emerge. Five years earlier Deke, then an L.A. County deputy, worked a murder case so obsessively, a former superior says, that “he got a suspension, a divorce and a triple bypass, all in six months.”<br />Now he’s mostly a pariah in the department, though it isn’t clear why; by all accounts he was a wizard at profiling serial killers. Mr. Malek’s detective, Jim Baxter, feels threatened when he senses Deke’s obsessive interest in his own case, a series of grisly assaults with multiple victims, all of them prostitutes, and no suspect. At the same time Deke, with his deep experience, is a source of wisdom and procedural knowledge, so the relationship develops along predictable lines. Wariness turns to partnership and, eventually, friendship. (John Schwartzman did the cinematography. Thomas Newman wrote the music.)<br />How fascinating you find the premise depends for much too long on your tolerance for hauntedness—Deke is more obsessed than Jimmy can know. He suffers from serial flashbacks, all of them shot in clammy darkness, to an old crime scene that continues to haunt him. He communes with—talks with, at mawkish length—some of the recently discovered corpses, the point being that cops must never, and cannot ever, forget the victims: “They’re your lifelong responsibility, Jimmy. You own them.” I owned a deep sense of discomfort (which the movie means us to feel) that gave way to increasing boredom until the search led to an appliance repair store in a seamy area of the San Fernando Valley, and to one of its employees, Albert Sparma, the suspect played by Mr. Leto.</td>

      <td>In his best performance yet, Justin Timberlake plays an ex-con who finds himself the surrogate dad to a struggling kid.</td>
      <td>The accidental parent is so reliable a character in fiction that one can think of multiple examples without making any effort at all (“Silas Marner,” “The Kid,” “A Perfect World,” “Horton Hatches the Egg”). But what “Palmer” indicates, aside from Justin Timberlake being a terrific actor, is that time and the proper talent can make a clichéd premise into something classic.<br />Directed with a sensitive hand by Fisher Stevens, “Palmer” begins with that old standby, the introductory aerial shot, this one carrying us across bridges and bayous and into watery, exurban Louisiana. The shot might be a joke: Ex-con Eddie Palmer (Mr. Timberlake) doesn’t fly anywhere. He takes the bus, in this case home from years in prison for something we’ll learn about later. Short on small talk, shorter on job prospects, Eddie, who prefers to be called Palmer, settles in with his grandmother Vivian (the always memorable June Squibb), who makes him go to church. His parole officer makes him look for work.<br />The creation of screenwriter Cheryl Guerriero, Palmer is the personification of regret, humiliation, frustration and considerable anger, which he keeps contained, at least until he witnesses the treatment of Sam (Ryder Allen), the nonbinary kid next door. Sam’s mother, Shelly (Juno Temple), who resides with her son in the trailer behind Vivian’s house, is a drug addict apt to disappear for weeks on end. Adding to the boy’s woes—though Sam is refreshingly stoic regarding just about everything—is his affinity for tutus and tea parties. “Boys don’t play with dolls,” says Palmer, to which Sam replies, “I’m a boy and I do.” Argue with that, neighbor.<br />What Ms. Guerriero has fashioned so honestly, with Messrs. Stevens and Timberlake making it tangible, is how Palmer regards the child. He isn’t inclined to be open-minded about Sam’s gender identity: Palmer grew up in the same place, and with the same attitudes, as his buddies, many of whom treat Sam like a freak. So do many of the kids at school (where Sam’s few allies include Miss Maggie, Sam’s teacher and Palmer’s paramour-to-be, played by the terrific Alisha Wainwright).<br />But Palmer knows what it’s like to be an outsider; he carries his pariah status around, albatross-like, which is a reason the head custodian (Lance E. Nichols) goes to bat with the school in getting Palmer hired as his assistant. It’s a dicey setup already, but when Shelly disappears for what seems like forever—it’s not; that’s how these stories work—Palmer becomes Sam’s surrogate dad and their relationship is the most endearing thing in a film with no shortage of virtues, or first-rate acting.</td>

      <td>Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan star as the duo behind a major archaeological discovery, a real event that astounded British scholars on the eve of World War II.</td>
      <td>Every now and then a film comes along—not a great one, necessarily—that makes you deeply glad. It’s how I feel about “The Dig.” This modest and quirky feature, set in rural England immediately before World War II, dramatizes one of the most important archaeological finds of the 20th century, a pair of medieval cemeteries, one of them containing an Anglo-Saxon ship filled with magnificent artifacts. I’m glad it got made—not a sure thing at all in a relentlessly commercial market—and made with such intelligence and respect for the factual details of the discovery by people who obviously loved what they were doing; glad it’s available to a wide audience on Netflix; and glad to have gained from it a heightened, and lengthened, sense of human history that the filmmakers convey in a style that’s the antithesis of grandiose.<br />The dig in question has come to be called Sutton Hoo, after its site on the banks of a tidal river in Suffolk. The film, directed by Simon Stone and adapted by Moira Buffini from a John Preston novel about the discovery, plunges us into the adventure by following an unassuming gent named Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) as he bicycles his way to the fairly imposing house of Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan), a widow eager to investigate a mysterious group of mounds on her property. The project calls for an archaeologist—not Indiana Jones, necessarily, but someone with more extensive training than Basil, who was, in real life, the man who made the discovery, and who describes himself here with with laconic pride as a lifelong excavator. Yet the nation is preparing for war, no archaeologists are available and Basil will have to do.<br />Thus does “The Dig” deftly address issues of class—Basil knows more about the history and texture of Suffolk’s soil than any credentialed expert a museum might have sent—while giving us a prime example of an archetype dear to English films, the calmly eccentric self-taught scholar (who of course smokes a pipe). Mr. Fiennes is superb in the role—you’ll be glad to watch him digging away with his shovel, and you’ll be thrilled, as I was, when, after digging for a good while, he shows up at Edith’s door and says, his voice quivering with emotion, “I think you’d better come and see.” (The emotional spectrum of the cinematography, by Mike Eley, ranges from solemn to ecstatic.)<br />The whole cast is superb. Ms. Mulligan brings a muted radiance to Edith, whose vitality is limited by disease. Archie Barnes is Edith’s young son, Robert; he devours sci-fi tales of the 25th century in his well-worn copies of Amazing Stories while a scientific tale of the sixth century unfolds around him. Ken Stott is Charles Phillips, an archaeologist from the British Museum who first sees Basil as little more than an annoying rustic. Charles comes around, as you might guess, announcing grandly that, on the basis of Basil’s discovery, the Anglo-Saxons “were not just marauding barterers. They had culture! They had art! They had money!” Basil is more eloquent, in his plain-spoken way. “From the first human handprint on a wall,” he says, “we’re part of something continuous.”<br />Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com</td>

      <td>The EU blows its rollout and blames a pharmaceutical firm.</td>
      <td>As the European Union fumbles its vaccine rollout, officials in Brussels are looking for villains. They think they’ve found one in vaccine-maker  AstraZeneca .<br />Rather than letting countries negotiate their own vaccine contracts, the European Commission handled procurement for the entire bloc in the name of solidarity. Brussels botched the process, and now the union’s members are lagging together.<br />Europe, the U.S. and U.K. have orders or options for roughly the same number of doses per capita. But the U.S. and U.K. moved faster to secure contracts, which made it easier for pharmaceutical companies to prepare. Washington and London also spent about seven times as much on development, production and procurement per person, according to the British analytics firm Airfinity. Some U.S. states face distribution challenges like many European countries, but American and British regulators approved vaccines faster than their EU counterparts.<br />The results are already clear. By our deadline Thursday, the U.K. had administered doses to more than 11% of residents, while the U.S. was approaching 8%. Denmark was a European success story at 3.7%, while France and Sweden languished around 2%.<br />This hasn’t inspired much reflection in Brussels. EU mandarins spent this week admonishing AstraZeneca after the firm announced that issues with production at a European factory meant it would delivers tens of millions of doses fewer than expected this quarter. The European Commission ordered a raid on AstraZeneca’s production site in Belgium on Wednesday.</td>

Vehicles that run on fossil fuels and emit pollution account for roughly 98% of GM’s sales today and all of its profit. The large pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles that are the company’s biggest money makers are also among its least fuel-efficient vehicles.<br />The nation’s largest auto maker by sales called the 2035 date to eliminate all tailpipe pollution an aspiration.

The federal government and many states offer tax credits to buyers to help offset the higher cost of plug-in cars.</td>

      <td>WHEN I FIRST laid eyes on the 2021 Genesis GV80’s grille—a handsome pentagonal broadshield with a chain-mail gusset—it reminded me to call my friend Rob. He’s a trademark attorney.<br />I mean, do we not all see the resemblance to a Cadillac’s front acreage? How does that happen? The shapes and legally defined geometries of what are called down-the-road graphics represent car brands’ most sacred intellectual property, typically defended by attorneys with chain saws and hockey masks.<br />Genesis, Hyundai’s six-year-old premium/luxury brand, even minted the phrase “Crest Grille’’—you know, as in the Cadillac Crest, the standard of the world? And the worst part is, the GV80 looks great. That’s going to leave a taste in GM’s mouth like cat-turd toothpaste.<br />The GV80 ($48,900-$70,950 MSRP, plus $1,025 delivery) is a midsize, two- or three-row people-mover, sharing the company’s rear/all-wheel platform with the superb 2021 G80 sedan, as well as many engineering details: a choice between two engines—a 2.5-liter, 300-hp turbo-four; or a 3.5-liter, 375-hp twin-turbo V6—an eight-speed automatic transmission; and an optional rear-biased AWD.<br />In my review in December, I compared the G80 3.5T Prestige ($68,050, as tested) to a nuclear Godzilla of value, throbbing with Cherenkov radiation, stomping Stuttgart and Munich to fiery flinders (paraphrasing there). Meanwhile, Genesis’ warranty and routine maintenance coverage are outstanding.</td>

      <td>Shares of  Qualtrics International Inc.,  a spinoff from  SAP  SE, rose roughly 38% in its public-markets debut amid a surge of investor interest in the enterprise-software sector.<br />Qualtrics ,  which makes software for businesses to track customer interactions, brands and employees, opened at $41.85 Thursday afternoon, compared with its initial public offering price of $30 a share. The opening price values the company at approximately $24.5 billion. Qualtrics is trading on the Nasdaq under ticker symbol “XM.”<br />The company arrives on the public market during a pandemic that has amplified a digital transition many businesses are undertaking as they adopt tools to boost interaction with customers online and to better run internal processes. That focus on digital operations has heightened the importance of Qualtrics’s products, the company’s chief executive, Zig Serafin, told The Wall Street Journal.<br />Investors have rewarded companies that support digital commerce. Shares of companies such as  Salesforce.com Inc.,  whose software helps businesses manage customer relationships, and  Square  Inc.,  a digital-payments company, have surged over the last 12 months. Others such as  Snowflake  Inc.,  a data-warehousing company, have preceded Qualtrics in launching successful pandemic-era IPOs.<br />SAP, based in Germany, maintains a controlling stake in Qualtrics following Thursday’s offering, owning 84% of the company’s common stock and 98% of its voting rights. SAP acquired Provo, Utah-based Qualtrics for roughly $8 billion in early 2019. Qualtrics had been on the verge of going public by itself at the time.</td>

      <td>Thanks to twistable spines and loose skin, canines and other animals can efficiently spin water off their bodies.</td>
      <td>Physicist Helen Czerski explores the complex science behind familiar phenomena. Read more columns here.<br />I’m increasingly envious of the dogs in my neighborhood. I can’t swim at the moment because all U.K. sports facilities are closed, and even now, in the cold depths of winter, the local river and lakes look more and more inviting. As I gaze longingly, in the full knowledge that I hate freezing water and so a swim is just a dream, there’s inevitably a woof and a splash as a very happy dog just launches itself straight in. After some goofy frolicking, it will clamber out, shake itself off and trot away to investigate a nearby squirrel as if nothing had happened. The thing I’m most envious of is the drying process—four seconds and it’s done. How is that possible?<br />The first thing to know is that it’s not just dogs. In a 2012 paper, David Hu and colleagues at the Georgia Institute of Technology looked at 16 species that shake themselves dry, including mice, bears, kangaroos, sheep, and a lion, and laid out the foundation of what’s going on. (The researchers coyly admitted that they were unable to measure the lion’s body directly, demonstrating that discretion really is the better part of scientific valor.)<br />When a wet dog is standing still, the water is pulled downward by gravity and drips from the hair on its belly. It’s a slow process, but you can speed it up by creating a force that effectively boosts gravity, which is what a spin dryer does. As the drum spins, it pushes inward on the clothes, making them go around in circles and creating a centrifugal force that pulls the water outward, where it can escape through the holes in the drum. My home spin dryer can generate an effective force 800 times stronger than gravity, and drags water out of clothes pretty quickly.<br />Evolution doesn’t need a spinning drum because mice, dogs and bears can twist their spine, oscillating their body round and back to produce an effective force outwards. This is what they’re doing when they shake themselves dry.</td>

The pain is largely being caused by the broad market turmoil and not one specific stock.<br />Candlestick Capital Management, a roughly $3 billion Greenwich, Conn., hedge fund started by former Citadel portfolio manager Jack Woodruff, was down in the low- to midteens for the year through Wednesday, said a person familiar with the fund. It was up 26% in 2020, its first year.<br />D1 Capital Partners, a top-performing fund in recent years founded by former Viking Global investment chief Dan Sundheim, was down about 20% for the year through Wednesday. Its substantial portfolio of investments in private companies has buffered the fund from a bigger loss. D1 managed $20 billion at the start of the year.</td>

      <td>Facebook Inc.’s  independent content-oversight board issued its first five rulings Thursday, overturning four instances where it found the company unfairly infringed upon users’ speech on the platform or misapplied vague rules on content that could cause imminent harm.<br />Among the board’s decisions were a determination that Facebook’s algorithms were wrong to remove a post about breast cancer identification that featured a woman’s nipple, and a finding that Facebook had been too strict in removing a French user’s post praising hydroxychloroquine, a once widely discussed treatment for Covid-19 that medical authorities have generally found not to be effective.<br />The group also said Facebook erred in taking down a post from a user in Myanmar with photos of a drowned Syrian Kurd child with text that said Muslims were too focused on insults of the Prophet Muhammad and appeared unconcerned about the treatment of Muslim Uighurs in China. The post also stated that there was something psychologically wrong with Muslim men and “seems to imply the child may have grown up to be an extremist,” the board wrote.<br />Oversight-board members determined the post didn’t reach the level of hate speech that justified removal, despite Myanmar’s recent history of social-media-fueled violence against Muslims—which the United Nations has described as an example of ethnic cleansing.<br />The oversight board’s decision was faulted by a group of prominent Facebook critics who have dubbed themselves “The Real Facebook Oversight Board” as well as Muslim civil-rights organizations.</td>

      <td>The short answer is the Margaret River region of Western Australia. But, after some searching, our wine columnist found a few delicious and affordable Cabs from California, too.</td>
      <td>TWO YEARS AGO I wrote a column describing my search for good Pinot Noirs under $20 a bottle. It wasn’t easy: Pinot Noir is a notoriously fickle grape, requiring just the right conditions to thrive, and the wines are both more difficult and more expensive to produce. Cabernet Sauvignon is a much easier, hardier grape. And yet, as I discovered in reporting this column, finding good, reasonably priced Cabernet can be just as hard, perhaps even harder.<br />Native to Bordeaux, France, Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the world’s most popular and most commonly planted grapes. It’s found just about anywhere winemakers are looking to make their mark—or lots of money—and produces both lofty and lousy wines. The former are made from grapes grown in great sites and carefully tended vineyards, fermented and aged in expensive French oak. The latter come from high-yielding vineyards, machine-harvested grapes fermented with oak chips and worse.<br />Mega Purple, for instance, is one of many additives that makers of commercial brands use to make the wine appear dark and suave and help mask green or herbaceous aromas of underripe grapes. But I wasn’t interested in featuring wines made from a confected combo of oak chips and sugar but, rather, from grapes grown to physiological ripeness, unmasked by excess oak. That eliminated the majority of the most popular Cab brands on the market today.<br />I started my search with an upper price limit of $20 a bottle but soon increased it to $25 when the pickings proved slim. I bought 17 bottles from various wine regions in California and Washington State as well as Australia, Argentina, Chile and even one wine from South Africa. Sadly, this example, the 2017 Stark-Condé Cabernet Sauvignon from the Stellenbosch region ($17), proved a disincentive to further South African Cabernet research.<br />Four Chilean Cabernets proved even more disappointing. I remember when Chilean Cabernets were pretty good, or at least not as aggressively herbaceous and weedy as the wines I bought. The 2017 Lapostolle Cuvée Alexandre Cabernet Sauvignon ($20) had an aromatic overlay of tobacco and dill. The 2017 Los Vascos Grande Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon ($12) and 2016 Montes Alpha Cabernet Sauvignon ($19) were equally stemmy and green.</td>

A recommendation from the European agency not to use the shot in older people would upend national vaccination plans that are tilted toward protecting those most at risk of dying from the disease.<br />In a sign of the urgency spreading across the continent, German Chancellor Merkel will hold a national vaccination summit with representatives of manufacturers on Feb. 1 in an effort to resolve the shortage of vaccines, her office said late on Thursday.<br />Europe is already lagging behind the U.K. and the U.S., which have vaccinated 11.3% and 7.1% of their populations respectively, according to data from Oxford University. By comparison, the EU has vaccinated just 2.2 % of its 450 million people.</td>

That group offers a right-wing alternative to Mr. Netanyahu for the coming election on March 23, the fourth parliamentary ballot in less than two years.<br />Unlike Israel’s elections over the past decade, where Mr. Netanyahu fended off challenges from the left and center, Mr. Saar is mounting a serious leadership challenge to his former mentor from the right.<br />That poses a significant threat to Mr. Netanyahu, who faces criticism over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his corruption trial. If Mr. Saar can continue to siphon off support from Mr. Netanyahu among right-wing parties in parliament, he could block the prime minister’s return to office.</td>

      <td>He’s ordered a review of a Trump policy against settlement payouts to favored third parties.</td>
      <td>Buried in the Biden administration’s flurry of early executive orders is a potential challenge to the core legislative function: the power to tax and spend. Under the proposal, the Justice Department may revert to using its enforcement power to force companies under investigation to give billions of dollars to outside interest groups—a common practice before June 2017. Implicitly, this amounts to a federal appropriation unauthorized by Congress.<br />After the 2008 financial crisis, for instance, the Obama administration’s Justice Department extracted multibillion-dollar settlement deals from major banks. These agreements directed the banks to send almost half the settlement dollars not to the Treasury or the actual victims of corporate misconduct but to “consumer relief” payments directed by administration officials. Among these payments: funding for new “affordable housing” developments, as well as gifts to government-sanctioned community-development, legal-aid and housing activist groups.<br />Although the Obama Justice Department was unusually aggressive in using threats to make implicit appropriations, it didn’t invent the approach. Under George W. Bush, Justice entered a deferred prosecution agreement with  Bristol Myers Squibb  that required the company to endow a professorship at Seton Hall University’s law school—alma mater of Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney overseeing the settlement deal. The professorship? A chair in business ethics.<br />Early in the Trump administration, Attorney General Jeff Sessions put an end to such practices. Under the policy Mr. Sessions adopted, “any agreement on behalf of the United States in settlement of federal claims or charges” couldn’t direct or provide for “a payment or loan to any non-governmental person or entity that is not a party to the dispute.” There were exceptions, as codified last year in a final rule—among them, restitution to actual victims, lawyer fees and “payments expressly authorized by statute.”<br />Mr. Sessions was right. Law enforcement necessarily generates some revenues from private parties. Money flows to the U.S. Treasury from statutorily authorized fines. In some cases, defendants should pay restitution to victims of civil or criminal misconduct. Yet that’s different from reallocating fines or restitution payments to unrelated third parties.</td>

Ironically, though, a misplaced target of their ire was Robin Hood, a New York charity that most definitely helps the poor. It was forced to respond over and over again to angry traders on Twitter.<br />Also ironic is that the escapades of Robinhood’s brokerage clients probably made a dent in the fortunes of some of the eponymous charity’s donors. The charity organization’s board includes hedge-fund stars David Einhorn, Paul Tudor Jones, Larry Robbins and David Tepper. Steven A. Cohen, an emeritus board member, certainly took a financial hit this week as his Point72 Asset Management was forced to come to the assistance of his former protégé at Melvin Capital Management, which made disastrous short bets on GameStop.<br />It is all fun and games until someone loses a charitable deduction.<br />Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com</td>

      <td>Historian Amanda Foreman searches the past for the origins of today’s world. Read previous columns here.<br /><br />Nowadays, all it takes for a person to be condemned to internal exile is a  Twitter  stampede of outrage. The lack of any regulating authority or established criteria for what constitutes repentance gives “cancel culture,” as it is popularly known, a particularly modern edge over more old-fashioned expressions of public shaming such as tar-and-feathering, boycotts and blacklists.<br />But the practice of turning nonconforming individuals into non-persons has been used with great effectiveness for centuries, none more so than the punishment of excommunication by the Roman Catholic Church. The penalties included social ostracism, refusal of communion and Christian burial, and eternal damnation of one’s soul.<br />The fear inspired by excommunication was great enough to make even kings fall in line. In 390, soldiers under the command of the Roman emperor Theodosius I massacred thousands in the Greek city of Thessalonica. In response, Bishop Ambrose of Milan excommunicated Theodosius, forcing him to don sackcloth and ashes as public penance. Ambrose’s victory established the Church’s authority over secular rulers.</td>

      <td>Sotheby’s sold Sandro Botticelli’s circa-1480 portrait of a “Young Man Holding a Roundel” for $92.2 million to a Russian-speaking collector during a live-streamed online sale Thursday, breaking the Italian Renaissance artist’s sales record and reaffirming a global appetite for trophy art following a tough year in the art market.<br />The portrait was estimated to sell for around $80 million, but a pair of anonymous telephone bidders vied for the work, with an Asian bidder losing quickly to a Russian-speaking bidder. The competition lacked the typical sizzle of a blockbuster sale moment, though.<br />Still, the work easily surpassed the artist’s previous record of $10.4 million when in 2013 Christie’s sold his “Madonna and Child with Young Saint John the Baptist,” also known as the Rockefeller Madonna because of its ties to the banking family.<br />The portrait also marked the year’s first major test of the art market and may go some way toward shoring up collector confidence in blue-chip masterworks—after collectors largely retrenched to lower-priced art amid the pandemic. Christie’s didn’t auction off a single work of art for over $80 million last year; Sotheby’s sold one work, a Francis Bacon, for $85 million. Overall, Sotheby’s sales fell 12% to $5 billion last year.<br />It may have helped that the Botticelli was being sold by the estate of New York real-estate developer Sheldon Solow, who spent decades amassing an enviable collection of Egyptian antiquities as well as art by Pablo Picasso, Alberto Giacometti and Vincent Van Gogh. Mr. Solow, who died last November, paid $1.2 million for the Botticelli in 1982.</td>

      <td>Social network’s forecast suggests Apple’s upcoming privacy update will have little impact</td>
      <td>It isn’t every day that  Facebook  can claim to be under someone’s thumb. The social network giant may be overplaying its hand.<br />Facebook, currently the sixth most valuable company in the S&P 500, used its fourth-quarter earnings call late Wednesday to step up its case against  Apple Inc.,  the benchmark index’s most valued enterprise. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg mentioned the iPhone maker more than half a dozen times in his opening presentation, describing Apple as “one of our biggest competitors,” and one that has “every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own.” For good measure, he also criticized the security of Apple’s highly popular iMessage service.<br />The source of his ire is a coming update to Apple’s iOS operating system that will require users to opt-in to ad-tracking features used by Facebook and many other internet advertisers. Apple confirmed Wednesday that the update—known as App Tracking Transparency, or ATT—is coming this spring, after having delayed its original plan to include the feature in its first release of iOS 14 last September.<br />The change has companies across the internet advertising space worried. Google on Wednesday warned its ad partners in a blog post that Apple’s changes “will reduce visibility into key metrics” that will affect how advertisers bid on ad impressions. “As such, app publishers may see a significant impact to their Google ad revenue on iOS after Apple’s ATT policies take effect.”<br />Facebook’s outcry was louder. With no sense of irony, a company that generated more than $84 billion in advertising revenue last year is casting itself as a champion of the little guy. Mr. Zuckerberg said Wednesday that the change means “many small businesses will no longer be able to reach their customers with targeted ads.” And he accuses Apple of acting in its own competitive interests. Advertising was indeed the second-largest driver of Apple’s service revenue that jumped 24% year over year to nearly $15.8 billion in the December quarter.</td>

      <td>Policyholders from  Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.  will now be able to take photographs of their damaged cars and almost instantaneously generate a repair estimate.<br />The new offering is thanks to a partnership between  Hartford Financial  and London-based Tractable. The startup is at the forefront of a growing number of technology firms trying to help car insurers use techniques such as artificial intelligence, computer vision and machine learning to speed up claims processes. Founded in 2014, Tractable already is working with big insurers in Japan and Europe.<br />The collaboration with  Hartford Financial  signals that artificial-intelligence activity is heating up in the U.S. car-insurance market, industry executives and consultants said. Among other strategic efforts, giant car insurer USAA has been working since 2019 with  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google Cloud unit to develop a photo-based estimating program for its policyholders.<br />Under Tractable’s approach, computers study the damage in photographs, which can be taken by policyholders while still at the wreck site or later. To produce estimates, the algorithms tap into data from a provider of parts and labor data.<br />Once the estimate is generated, policyholders can select a recommended body shop and get the repair work started.</td>

      <td>The fourth quarter’s growth was concentrated at the start of the quarter, leaving the economy in a weak position now</td>
      <td>The U.S. economy ended last year with a whimper. It is no sure thing that it will end this year with a bang.<br />The Commerce Department on Thursday reported that gross domestic product grew at a 4% annual rate in the fourth quarter from the previous, after growing at a 33.4% rate in the second quarter. These annualized figures show what would happen if the quarterly change lasted full a year. In actual terms, GDP grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 7.5% in the third—not enough to take the economy out of the hole the Covid-19 crisis put it into in the first half of the year. GDP last quarter was 2.5% lower than a year earlier.<br />More worryingly, the fourth quarter’s gain in GDP from the previous quarter came about because the fourth quarter started so well. Monthly GDP estimates from IHS Markit show that GDP in October was up about 0.6% from September, and was 1.4% higher than its third quarter average. But November was worse, with rising Covid-19 cases stifling consumer spending. And though Thursday’s report suggests that the economy recovered a bit of ground in December (IHS’s December estimates aren’t available yet), it looks as though GDP was below its October level.<br />Mechanically, that makes it harder for GDP to register growth in the first quarter—if it began the fourth quarter on third base, it began the current quarter in the batter’s box and behind in the count. Still, thanks in large part to the $900 billion relief package that passed late last year, economists are forecasting GDP will post modest growth in the first quarter. Then in the second quarter, with another relief package expected and vaccines more widely available, they expect growth to be much stronger.<br />Beyond the mechanics, the weakening in GDP in the fourth quarter brings home how the economy remains in the pandemic’s grip. While a tailspin like last spring’s isn’t in the cards, renewed caution and restrictions can still stifle growth. Moreover, while there is plenty of reason to hope vaccines will bring the coronavirus under control later this year, there are also reasons for caution. The emergence of mutations that current vaccines may not be effective against, such as the variant believed to have emerged in the Brazilian Amazon, raises the possibility that in a year’s time the country will still be hobbled by Covid-19.</td>

      <td>WARSAW—Thousands of women took to the streets of Polish cities after an extensive ban on abortion took effect, three months after a court ruled that it was unconstitutional to terminate pregnancies because of fetal abnormalities.<br />A rights group called Women’s Strike led crowds of people into the streets of Warsaw, Krakow and other cities as the law took effect at midnight, after it was upheld by Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal. The ruling, more than 200 pages long, said that allowing abortion because of congenital defects violated the Polish constitution, which protects all human life.<br />Further protests are planned this week, reflecting broader concern among younger Poles over the conservative policies of Poland’s government, which is allied with the Catholic Church and has tried to tighten Poland’s already-strict abortion laws since coming to power in 2015. Similar protests last fall drew tens of thousands of people in Warsaw alone.<br />Many demonstrators say they are concerned over the way the ruling Law and Justice party previously purged members of the Constitutional Tribunal and replaced them with conservative judges, drawing criticism from the European Union and elsewhere.<br />Anita Czerwińska, spokeswoman for the Law and Justice party, said it is still studying the court’s judgment before commenting. The party has said that the court is responsive to the wishes of Polish voters, who have repeatedly handed Law and Justice majorities in Poland’s parliament.</td>

      <td>Right now, there may be no greater gift for a company than dismal finances.<br />On Thursday, shares of  American Airlines  rose almost 30% at the open, reaching an 11-month high. American beat analysts’ profit expectations for the final quarter of 2020: Earnings per share came in at a negative $3.86, whereas the median forecast had them at $4.11.<br />But that doesn’t explain the pop. What does is that the numbers were still really bad in absolute terms—a $2.2 billion quarterly loss is one of the company’s worst results ever—justifying bearish Wall Street bets against it. In today’s topsy-turvy market, this all but guarantees stock gains.<br />Over the past week, swarms of individual investors, coordinating ithrough websites like Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, have taken on professional speculators, aggressively using options to unravel hedge funds’ preferred short bets. By squeezing the derivatives positions of banks, they have managed to engineer crazy rallies in the shares of troubled firms like  GameStop ,   BlackBerry ,   AMC  and  Nokia .<br />American Airlines was the perfect next target. It is the most-shorted major U.S. carrier, with 25% of its shares outstanding currently sold short in bets against it, according to FactSet data. Even better for Reddit-fuelled speculators, the company is disliked for very solid, objective reasons.</td>

      <td>A castle in Umbria, a palace in Lisbon, a maximalist retreat on Paris’s Left Bank. When Europe opens to Americans again, these buzzy new hotels will be worth pouncing on.</td>
      <td>WHILE MUCH of the world has been sticking close to—if not literally confined to—home this past year, some of Europe’s most inspired hoteliers have spent the pandemic following Voltaire’s sage advice for troubling times: tending their gardens (while patiently awaiting travel’s return). In the pre-Covid travel boom, many new projects got under way and several have already opened, like the NoMad London, the design firm Roman and Williams’s version of plush neo-Edwardian digs in the former Bow Street Magistrates’ Court. Across the continent, other hotels have also come on line or will soon. For those eager beavers ready to flit off to Europe as soon as they get the all-clear, file away these inviting newcomers:<br />Last September, Madrid’s hotel scene ascended a few rungs on the luxury ladder with the opening of Spain’s first Four Seasons Hotel, set in a landmark former bank building in the middle of the city. Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, and the art museums along the Paseo del Prado are just a short stroll away. The suites are massive, the views impressive and the spa and fitness center take over four floors. On a rooftop terrace, chef Dani García, has been luring the locals with his fabulous but informal restaurant Dani (from $660 a night, fourseasons.com/madrid). By the end of 2021—when, with luck, the pandemic will be behind us—the hotel will face more top-of-the-market competition: the newly renovated Mandarin Oriental Ritz next to the Prado and Rosewood’s overhaul of the Villa Magna in tony Barrio de Salamanca.<br />Among the hotels that saw their spring 2020 launch stymied by Covid was Lisbon’s Hotel Palácio Príncipe Real. Respecting the floor plan of a 19th-century palace that has been in the same family for a century, the hotel features 26 rooms, each decorated in a style best described by hotel owner Gail Curley as “pared-down palatial.” A jacaranda tree shading the exuberant garden inspired the decoration of several rooms as well as the color of the pool towels (from about $300 a night, palacioprincipereal.com).<br />When it opened last January, the J.K. Place Paris unleashed a maximalist Milanese design in the midst of the quaint Left Bank. While the lobby, bar and skylit Casa Tua restaurant are urbanely eclectic (modernist furniture meets African fabrics, 18th-century Chinese screens, and oodles of contemporary art), a quieter story plays out upstairs where the rooms might be too restrained, limited to subtle tonalities of gray and white. Good thing that, especially in Paris, one ought not spend much time in a hotel room (from about $775 a night, jkplace.paris).<br />After 15 years spent converting two dozen abandoned farmhouses on his family’s 3,700-acre Umbrian estate into luxury villas, Count Benedikt Bolza has now restored the estate’s 11th-century Castello di Reschio into a 36-room hotel. Guests can flop by the swimming pool or explore the miles of rolling hills surrounding the castle on foot, bicycle or horseback(from about $915 a night, reschio.com). In Sicily, the Relais & Châteaux Il San Corrado di Noto brings a new level of 21st-century luxury to a region better known for its fusty baroque style and vast acres of agriculture. The new resort features 26 suites set among a restored 18th-century manor house, stables and olive groves. Chef Ciccio Sultano (his restaurant, Duomo, in nearby Ragusa Ibla, has two Michelin stars) designed the menu to highlight the cultures that have informed Sicily’s evolution over the millennia (from about $725 a night, ilsancorradodinoto.com).</td>

      <td>Germany’s stock-market regulator said Thursday that it filed a criminal complaint with prosecutors against one of its employees over suspected insider trading linked to  Wirecard AG , raising fresh questions about the supervisor’s handling of one of the country’s biggest corporate scandals.<br />BaFin, the regulator, said the employee sold structured products linked to Wirecard on June 17, the day before the company said its auditors couldn’t confirm the existence of some $2 billion in cash. Shares of the fintech company crashed, and days later it filed for bankruptcy. Prosecutors are investigating allegations ranging from accounting manipulation to money laundering.<br />BaFin said it found out about the suspicious trading during a special audit, and that it reported the employee to the Stuttgart public prosecutor’s office Wednesday. The unnamed employee, who has been suspended, isn’t senior staff, a person familiar with the probe said.<br />German lawmakers have criticized BaFin for failing to act earlier on red flags over Wirecard. The regulator drew criticism last year after admitting it allowed its staff to trade the company’s shares while it was investigating it, something many regulators around the world forbid. Amid the backlash, BaFin in October decided to ban most of its staff from trading shares and other securities from financial companies.<br />The head of another German regulator—Apas, which oversees auditors—disclosed in December that he had also traded shares of Wirecard while he oversaw a probe of the company’s auditor, Ernst & Young GmbH. He has since been suspended.</td>

Separate U.S. sanctions, levied against Iran under authorities targeting terrorism, ballistic-missile development and human rights abuses, weren’t part of the nuclear deal.<br />“If Iran comes back into compliance, we would, too,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was confirmed to his post by senators on Tuesday, testified last week.</td>

Consumers in the U.K.-based company’s largest market are drinking more at home during the pandemic. They are also returning to trusted brands such as Baileys, which has helped Diageo to gain around 15 basis points of market share since July.<br />Buoyant demand in the U.S. made up for much harsher conditions elsewhere. Sales in Europe and Turkey, the company’s second-largest market by revenue, fell 10%. Although recovering, the region will be under pressure until bars and restaurants can reopen. Unlike Americans, Europeans tend to do more of their drinking outside the home.<br />Business in Asia is suffering from the sharp fall in airport duty-free sales. In Latin America, consumers are starting to trade down to cheaper brands as their disposable incomes are pinched. Overall, Diageo’s sales increased by just 1% over the six months through December, beating expectations of a decline.<br />The American market has been a bright spot for most drinks companies since Covid-19 went global. Tonic-water maker FeverTree, which also reported results Thursday, said its U.S. sales increased 23% in 2020. But Diageo is also reaping the rewards of a recent effort to tidy up its portfolio. In late 2018, it sold 19 lower-priced brands to privately owned Sazerac and has focused instead on fast-growing and higher-margin categories like gin and tequila.</td>

      <td>THE ONLY child of a tobacco tycoon, Doris Duke had tripled her inheritance to $1.2 billion by the time she died in 1993 at age 80, leaving most of it to charity. No surprise that displays of wealth dot her personal bathroom at Rough Point—the 39,000-square-foot estate in Newport, R.I., in which she summered. Blingy light fixtures illuminate gilt French antiques. But unlike, say, a “Real Housewives” McMansion, the décor avoids nouveau riche peacocking thanks largely to the earthy, leaf-strewn wallpaper, which clambers from floor to ceiling. The pattern evokes the extensive grounds that Duke’s pet Bactrian camels, Princess and Baby, roamed during her summer sojourns.<br />“It’s so wonderful, like Irish heather,” said decorator Carleton Varney of the wall covering. The powder room is a favorite spot of Mr. Varney, who worked with design luminary Dorothy Draper from 1962 until 1969, and bought her namesake company. From offices in Palm Beach he carries on her mission of merrily undercutting the predictability of fairly traditional furniture with juicy-hued patterns and jolting contrasts.<br />Rough Point, built in 1891 for Frederick W. Vanderbilt, is now a museum, with this room exactly as Duke left it: the simple, checkered marble floor grounding the sort of sparkle Mr. Varney believes the house demands. Here, he offers ways to approximate that old-money balance.<br />Duke brought a bit of Paris home with her in the form of a souvenir chandelier that dates to the 1750s, festooned with glass rosettes and gilt faux candles. Though fanciful, its emerald-glass leaves align visually with the down-to-earth wallcovering. Hang a comparable—though admittedly less glittery—French 19th-Century Painted Tôle Three-Light Chandelier with Flowers and Vines. $2,950, 1stdibs.com<br />The classic checkered black-and-white marble floor moors the room. “Ms. Draper always said every room needs a touch of black as an anchor,” Mr. Varney said. Woven into the similarly grounding wool rug: sea horses and circles that echo the dolphin taps and the motif on the tub. (The graphic on the marble tub also adds structure; for a similar touch on your own tub, Mr. Varney would use masking tape to prep the pattern, then spray paint it.)

They go sort of hand-in-glove.”<br />Many Republicans and some Democrats have balked at the cost of the administration’s proposal and suggested there would be bipartisan support for a smaller package focused on vaccine distribution, potentially a third round of direct checks and some other measures.</td>

Measured from the fourth quarter to the same quarter a year ago, the economy shrank 2.5%.<br />The coronavirus and related business disruptions put in place early in the pandemic upended the U.S. economy early last year, triggering business and school closures, a steep drop in demand for goods and services and record job losses. The economy rebounded in the second half of the year as it reopened, with sharp gains in employment and consumer spending over the summer that were helped by trillions of dollars in government aid.<br />While the recovery has slowed this winter, economists expect it will pick up again later in 2021, once the pandemic is under control, though the coronavirus remains a threat to the global economy.</td>

The selloff has taken place amid wild swings in individual stocks including GameStop and AMC Entertainment, fueled by a battle between day traders and hedge-fund professionals.<br />“There is some over-excitement in the market,” said Olaf van den Heuvel, chief investment officer for Aegon Asset Management in the Netherlands, pointing to the surge in GameStop shares as one example. “It was bubble territory.”</td>

Abraaj before its fall had said it managed almost $14 billion for investors including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Bank of America Corp., the World Bank and the U.S. and U.K. governments. Mr. Naqvi is accused of taking hundreds of millions of dollars from the firm.<br />Mr. Naqvi was arrested at London’s Heathrow Airport in April 2019 as he returned from Pakistan, where he was born. He faces a prison sentence of up to 291 years if found guilty of all the charges from the Justice Department. He is currently under home confinement in London while out of custody on bail.<br />Judge Emma Arbuthnot announced her decision to allow Mr. Naqvi’s extradition in a London court Thursday. His lawyer last year argued that extradition would violate Mr. Naqvi’s human rights because U.S. jail conditions are so bad they raise the risk of making him suicidal if he was detained ahead of his trial. The case is now referred to the U.K. home secretary, and Mr. Naqvi will be able to appeal the decision, the judge said.<br />“His unshakable conviction is that he is entirely innocent,” Mr. Naqvi’s lawyer Hugo Keith said in court last year. Mr. Keith won a concession from the U.S. government last year that his client wouldn’t be detained ahead of trial in Manhattan’s Metropolitan Correctional Center, where Jeffrey Epstein died.</td>

      <td>The number of workers seeking unemployment benefits dropped last week, indicating a recent easing in the pace of layoffs though the labor market remains mired in a winter slowdown.<br />New jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, declined to 847,000 in the week ended Jan. 23, down from a revised 914,000 the week before.<br />The weekly tallies have remained for months well above the pre-pandemic peak of 695,000 and are higher than in any previous recession for records tracing back to 1967.<br />“The virus is in the driver’s seat—there’s no getting around it,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist and data scientist at Glassdoor, a company-ratings and job-listings website. “Until we control the pandemic, we can’t hope for a full recovery economically.”<br />Weekly jobless claims are volatile but have generally trended higher since November, when they were below 800,000, to 926,000 during the week of Jan. 9. They point to a slowing economic recovery, as surging coronavirus case numbers, fresh safety restrictions and colder weather hamper the labor market’s recovery from the initial shock of the pandemic last spring. Employers cut 140,000 jobs nationwide in December, with gains in many industries more than offset by losses at restaurants, bars, hotels and other businesses related to leisure and tourism.</td>

      <td>Consumers may be rushing back to their favorite restaurants as the pandemic eases, but convenience should continue to deliver for DoorDash</td>
      <td>Food-delivery platform  DoorDash  is now trading nearly 90% above its initial public offering price just as vaccines are being broadly distributed in the U.S. and restaurants in some of its largest markets are poised to reopen outdoor dining. So why isn’t this stock a screaming short?<br />The answer may be more about convenience than taste. In addition to restaurant delivery, DoorDash has been building up its market share in third-party delivery for other goods, such as those from the likes of 7-Eleven, Wawa, Circle K and CVS. Post-pandemic, those ancillary opportunities could prove to be more central to DoorDash’s growth thesis than bearish investors are appreciating.<br />The bulk of DoorDash’s appeal heading into its December IPO was how quickly it was able to go from 0 to 60 in food delivery. The company says it had just 17% U.S. market share in terms of total sales in January 2018 but that its share had grown to 50% as of last October—nearly twice that of its next-largest competitor, Uber Eats. Now it turns out that in more nascent markets like convenience delivery, DoorDash has been growing even more quickly.<br />A report out from Edison Trends Thursday shows DoorDash now owns 58% of U.S. convenience-store spending via third-party delivery apps, more than twice that of its next-largest competitor, goPuff. Last January, Edison Trends had DoorDash’s share at around 5% and goPuff at 70%. For all of Uber’s talk of leaning strongly into auxiliary delivery services, Uber Eats’ market share in third-party convenience goods is now just 8%, according to the report.<br />For DoorDash, the convenience market may be more than just icing on the cake. Based on Edison Trends’ analysis, overall online consumer spending at convenience stores grew nearly 350% in 2020, nearly three times faster than online restaurant consumer sales. DoorDash customers increased their convenience-store spending by 162% sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter, according to EdisonTrends’ data—a good sign for DoorDash’s first earnings report as a public company coming up late next month.</td>

      <td>The decadeslong decline in U.S. cigarette sales halted last year as people in lockdown lit up more frequently and health concerns around e-cigarettes caused some vapers to switch back to cigarettes.<br />Before the pandemic, U.S. cigarette unit sales had been falling at an accelerating rate, hitting 5.5% in 2019, as smokers quit or switched to alternatives like e-cigarettes. The pandemic put the brakes on that slide. In 2020, the U.S. cigarette industry’s unit sales were flat compared to the previous year, according to data released Thursday by Marlboro maker  Altria Group Inc.<br />People had more opportunities to smoke because they spent more time at home and had more money to spend on cigarettes because they spent less on gas, travel and entertainment, Altria said. At the same time, some e-cigarette users turned back to combustible cigarettes because of increased e-cigarette taxes, bans on flavored vaping products and confusion about the health effects of vaping, consumers and industry officials say.<br />U.S. cigarette sales were even stronger last year than they were in 2015, when many consumers switched back to cigarettes after trying first-generation vaping devices. Those early products didn’t deliver nicotine effectively enough to satisfy some addicted cigarette smokers. But e-cigarette sales took off again in 2017, spurred by the popularity of a new vaporizer called Juul.<br />E-cigarette sales were booming in the fall of 2019 when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, investigating an outbreak of a mysterious lung illness, warned consumers not to use any vaping products. Sales took a nosedive. The illness later was linked to vitamin E oil in marijuana vaping products, but the public’s perception of e-cigarette safety hasn’t rebounded and neither have sales.</td>

Several eurozone banks are due to report their annual results next week.<br />The true health of eurozone borrowers has become harder to track due to the amount of financial support from the ECB and the region’s governments, which includes payment holidays on existing loans. In Italy, for instance, over a quarter of loans to businesses are under payment moratoriums. In Portugal, half of the credit to companies in the hospitality and restaurant sectors are under the program.</td>

      <td>Oil refiners and ethanol producers’ collective pain hasn’t done much to align their interests</td>
      <td>In the tug of war for former President Donald Trump’s favors, oil refiners won some surprising victories over ethanol producers. Their fortunes are about to flip under President Joe Biden’s climate-driven administration.<br />The fate of U.S. oil refiners and ethanol are inextricably linked through the so-called Renewable Fuel Standard, which sets annual quotas for the quantity of ethanol and biodiesel that must be blended into transportation fuels. The burden of meeting the blending requirements falls on those that refine or import oil. Those unable to meet any given year’s quota must fulfill it by buying Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) in the open market from those who have blended gallons to spare.<br />But sometimes the price of those RINs becomes excessively burdensome. Much to the ethanol industry’s chagrin, the Environmental Protection Agency issued 85 exemptions for refiners unable to meet the required blending requirements under the Trump administration—a big jump from the 23 given out during Barack Obama’s second term (prior to that, small refiners were automatically exempted). Exemptions are granted if refiners can prove they were unable to meet obligations without running into “disproportionate economic hardship.” The issue came into focus in 2018 when refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions went bankrupt, partly blaming Renewable Fuel Standard-related payments. That same year refiner  CVR Energy ,  owned by former Trump adviser Carl Icahn, also got a valuable exemption.<br />The next four years are likely to be tougher for oil refiners seeking relief. For one, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in January 2020 that the Environmental Protection Agency wrongly exempted three refineries from renewable fuel requirements. Its ruling also narrowed down the number of refiners that would qualify for future exemptions. Since that ruling, RIN prices have skyrocketed, fetching about 10 times what they did a year ago, according to data from S&P Global Platts. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to take up the case after two refiners appealed the decision.<br />The Biden administration has signaled climate issues as one of its priorities. New leadership at the EPA will be in charge of determining blending obligations for 2021, which the previous administration didn’t set by the Nov. 30 deadline. The new volume obligations likely won’t emerge until the second half of the year. Corey Lavinsky, director of global biofuels at S&P Global Platts, notes that Biden’s EPA is likely to set strong mandates for 2021 and 2022 and to enforce them.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Government debt around the world shot up last year to approach levels last seen in the aftermath of World War II, as nations stepped up spending to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic fallout, the International Monetary Fund said Thursday.<br />Public debt as a share of global gross domestic product surged to 98% by the end of December from 84% at the end of 2019, before the pandemic struck, the IMF said in an update to its semiannual Fiscal Monitor report. The IMF is the global lender of last resort to countries in distress and tracks debt levels closely. The total dollar value of global debt, which includes central and state government debt, came to $89.6 trillion at year’s end.<br />The increase was particularly large among advanced economies, which can easily borrow at low interest rates. The debt-to-GDP ratio among those nations rose to 123% by December from 105% in 2019, and it is expected to grow to 125% this year.<br />“From 2021 onwards, debt stabilizes at a high level and stays elevated well above the pre-Covid-19 level up to the end of” 2021, said Vitor Gaspar, director of the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department.<br />The IMF said governments should emphasize measures to combat the pandemic and cautioned against prematurely dialing back on spending.</td>

ATM thefts increased more than 50% in 2018 and 2019, based on surveys by the ATM Industry Association. The trade group said it didn’t do a 2020 survey due to the pandemic.<br />Several police departments and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said they don’t track attempts to steal money from ATMs as a category.<br />A bank machine can hold a couple-hundred-thousand dollars, industry executives say. Smaller ones at convenience stores often have up to $20,000. During last spring’s pandemic lockdown, ATMs that normally held $50,000 might have contained $100,000, said 3SI Marketing Director Lisa Moughan, because banks and credit unions urged customers to use the machines for withdrawals when many branches temporarily closed.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Bullish day traders have rallied together to buy shares of  GameStop Corp.  in recent weeks, driving up the price more than 10-fold and prompting complaints that the frenetic activity is manipulative.<br />The frenzy has played out on public websites such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets, where small investors brag about their gains and exhort others to buy more shares and options. That transparency could make it easier for regulators to levy claims of manipulation, which historically has been a difficult offense for regulators to prove.<br />“If they are all egging each other on using a social-media platform, they are effectively engaged in a crowdsourced pump-and-dump scheme,” said Daniel Hawke, a partner at Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP.<br />The traders “are making no effort to conceal their apparent intent to manipulate the price of the stock,” added Mr. Hawke, a former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s market abuse unit.<br />The two-week rally in shares of GameStop, once one of the most heavily shorted stocks, has captivated the stock market. The winners have been smaller investors whose feverish buying has also pushed up prices of  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  and  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.  The losers have been some hedge-fund managers and other contrarian investors who had bet against the future of the struggling videogame retailer.</td>

      <td>PARIS—When President Biden announced the U.S. was rejoining the Paris climate accord, one of the first world leaders to welcome him back was President Emmanuel Macron of France.<br />The French leader had been a persistent critic of former President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the agreement, calling on world leaders to “Make Our Planet Great Again,” in an apparent riff on Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan.<br />In France, however, Mr. Macron is discovering how hard the agreement is to implement without imposing painful changes on the way people live in developed economies. France is falling behind the rest of Europe in reducing emissions, and Mr. Macron hasn’t settled on a strategy to meet the country’s pledges under the Paris accord.<br />Mr. Macron created an assembly of everyday citizens to come up with a sweeping plan to place France on a trajectory to become carbon neutral by 2050. But the assembly’s plan—which ranges from curbs on domestic flights to taxes on SUV sales—has now run into opposition from Mr. Macron himself.<br />“We need to make some adjustments,” said a close presidential aide, adding that some of the proposals were unacceptable to the public. Mr. Macron recently told the youth-focused news website Brut that the government needed to study the proposals’ economic impact, adding that it wasn’t up to the assembly to “anticipate everything, think of everything.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden plans to end a policy that prohibits federal funds from going to foreign-aid groups that perform abortions or provide related services, one of several moves likely to spark renewed debate over abortion access.<br />Mr. Biden can make some of his intended changes quickly, but others will likely run into hurdles in Congress, where Democrats hold narrow majorities. Echoing many Democrats and abortion-rights advocates, he has said he backs ending a provision in spending bills known as the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funds from being used for abortions except in limited cases. But many Republicans say they will oppose any spending bill that doesn’t include the amendment.<br />The White House said Mr. Biden on Thursday will issue a “Presidential Memorandum to protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health care,” as part of a series of health care-related actions. Among its effects will be to reverse a rule known as the “Mexico City policy”—or, to critics, the “global gag rule.” The policy bars foreign nongovernmental groups that get U.S. funding from providing abortions or abortion information. Recent Democratic administrations have ended the policy, and Republican administrations have reinstated it.<br />The memorandum will also direct the Department of Health and Human Services to consider rescinding regulations under the federal Title X family-planning program. The Trump administration implemented one that cut off federal funding for organizations such as Planned Parenthood Federation of America.<br />“It is a good down payment, absolutely,” Ilyse Hogue, president of Naral Pro-Choice America, said of Mr. Biden’s anticipated early moves, adding that advocates of wider abortion access know the hurdles facing a repeal of the Hyde Amendment.</td>

Staple menu items sold by the burger company boosted U.S. sales, McDonald’s said.<br />But tightened restrictions on businesses and indoor dining, particularly in Western Europe, dragged on business abroad, McDonald’s said. Fourth-quarter sales at international restaurants that McDonald’s runs were down 7.4% from a year earlier, improving on the previous quarter’s 10.1% decline.<br />But overall, McDonald’s said costs related to the pandemic, including spending on safety equipment and marketing, ate into profit during its latest period. The company reported earnings, adjusted for one-time items, of $1.70 a share for the quarter, missing analysts’ expectations of $1.77 a share. Revenue of $5.3 billion for the quarter also came in slightly below projections.<br />A surge in Covid-19 cases depressed sales across many consumer sectors late last year. For restaurants, the impact was especially acute in places that required them to shut their dining rooms again.</td>

Diageo said sales in its largest market were also buoyed by a continuing shift among drinkers from beer and wine to spirits, and by a rush from distributors to restock.<br />Net spirits sales in the U.S. grew 15% in the last six months of 2020 on an organic basis, which strips out currency movements, driven by an 80% jump in tequila net sales as Don Julio and Casamigos were embraced by drinkers staying in. Tequila now accounts for 7% of Diageo’s global net sales, up from 1% five years ago.<br />Diageo said consumers in the U.S.—following the early days of lockdown when they stocked up on large bottles of booze—have been reaching for pricier liquor as they look to replicate a bar experience at home.<br />The company reported a 12% rise in U.S. sales for Baileys, which Chief Executive Ivan Menezes said reflected the company’s efforts to market the drink as a year-round treat rather than just a winter dessert liquor. It pushed the brand as a baking ingredient for banana bread during lockdown and launched a seasonal apple pie variant to cater to the home baking trend.</td>

That would make it subject to higher capital requirements and probably dramatically slower growth.<br />What is happening is emblematic of two trends. The first is Beijing’s desire to get a tighter grip on China’s booming online financial services industry.<br />Ant has had a revolutionary impact on Chinese consumer finance—creating what was at one point the largest money-market fund in the world—helping expand access to loans for small borrowers. That’s not without drawbacks, however, including serious financial stability concerns. Ant’s capital-light model of originating loans for banks for a fee without taking on much risk itself created a clear potential for abuse.<br />But the second trend is a political culture that can’t brook alternative centers of influence.</td>

Her research on labor markets, education and discrimination fits squarely with President Biden’s priorities of rebuilding a labor market that has lost nearly 10 million jobs during the pandemic and addressing racial and income disparities.<br />“It’s an excellent nomination,” said Greg Mankiw, who chaired the CEA under President George W. Bush and taught at Harvard when Ms. Rouse was working on her economics doctorate there. “I’m not expecting to agree with her on everything, but given what President Biden was looking for, he hit a home run with Ceci.”<br />Ms. Rouse, 57 years old, served as one of three members of the CEA during the first two years of the Obama administration and on President Bill Clinton’s National Economic Council in 1998 and 1999. She is dean of Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs.</td>

Now, with the competition moving fast, it is time to spend to make sure the company can stay on the leading edge of the semiconductor and consumer-electronics industries.<br />The South Korean technology company had a strong 2020: Operating profit rose 30% year over year as the Covid-19 pandemic drove demand for memory chips, both in personal computers and data centers. The boom, however, now seems to be losing momentum. Operating profit last quarter dropped 27% from the previous quarter on a strong won and declining memory prices. The company expects profit to weaken this quarter.<br />The company has been building up dry powder: Net cash at the end of 2020 stood at 104.5 trillion won, equivalent to $93.4 billion, a 61% rise from 2017. Samsung announced a special dividend Thursday as well as raising its regular dividend in the next three years.<br />Samsung should also try to put some of that cash into growth. And the company has hinted that it could soon do exactly that. During the earnings call Thursday, it said it is optimistic about meaningful mergers and acquisitions in the coming three years.<br />Samsung hasn’t made a major acquisition since 2017. Acquiring a non-memory semiconductor or communications technology could help the company diversify away from the notoriously cyclical memory-chip business. More than half of Samsung’s operating profit last year came from its semiconductor division, mostly from memory chips.</td>

Earlier this month,  Tesla Inc.  started delivering its locally built Model Y—the second vehicle after the Model 3 produced at its Shanghai factory.

The companies, all listed in the U.S., together delivered nearly 45,000 vehicles in China in the October-December quarter. NIO recently unveiled a new electric sedan, its fourth production model.<br />EV sales are expected to grow strongly in China. The government is targeting to sell around 5 million EVs annually by 2025, or a fifth of total vehicle sales. There were 1.11 million electric cars sold in China last year, according to the China Passenger Car Association, accounting for nearly 6% of the country’s car market.</td>

Revenue rose to 61.55 trillion won from the prior year’s 59.88 trillion won.<br />Analysts had forecast about 6.74 trillion won in net profit and 61.21 trillion won in revenue, according to estimates from S&P Global Market Intelligence.<br />Like other technology companies, Samsung has fared well in the pandemic on the strength of demand for most consumer electronics and displays, though economic pressures squeezed smartphone sales in the first half of last year. The company is closely watched in the technology world, as a major manufacturer of appliances and computing devices as well as a critical supplier to other electronics firms.</td>

      <td>Reddit’s popular WallStreetBets forum briefly went dark late Wednesday, stunning users who had been flooding the community with posts all week amid a frenzied stock rally.<br />A message on the forum’s landing page initially said WallStreetBets had been taken private by its moderators because of technical difficulties on an “unprecedented scale as a result of the newfound interest in WSB.”<br />About an hour later, the forum was made available to the public again.<br />It wasn’t immediately clear why the forum was opened again. A post from one of WallStreetBets’ moderators noted the team had struggled to keep up with the influx of comments and posts submitted to the forum in recent days.<br />WallStreetBets has been the subject of growing fascination and scrutiny as once-unpopular stocks ranging from GameStop Corp. to  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  have drawn significant interest from individual investors, helping catapult their share prices to eye-popping highs. Much of the discussion surrounding these shares has originated on WallStreetBets and then was amplified across the internet.</td>

      <td>Disappointing fourth-quarter earnings highlight the reality that Elon Musk’s car company will struggle to justify its valuation</td>
      <td>The furious rally in so-called Reddit stocks has captivated Wall Street and the general public. While the attention is elsewhere, a much more familiar mania is still worthy of investor scrutiny.<br />Tesla Inc.  reported fourth quarter sales of $10.7 billion and earnings of 24 cents a share on Wednesday, its fifth straight quarter of profits, according to generally accepted accounting principles. The car company also said it would increase production by at least 50% in 2021 from last year, when it delivered nearly half a million vehicles. Shares sold off after hours, but faithful Tesla shareholders barely felt a scratch: Buying the stock in May 2019 and holding on to it would have earned more than 22 times the initial investment.<br />That fact should alarm shareholders as much as it delights them: Tesla is sporting a market cap of $800 billion, which is more than seven times the combined sum of  Ford  and  General Motors .  That valuation is paired with a minuscule share of the global auto market. Faith in Chief Executive Elon Musk to work magic evidently goes a long way.<br />Granted, Tesla vehicles have proven to be enormously popular with Mr. Musk’s devoted fan base, and competition from established auto makers has been slow to roll out. Yet to assume ever-growing market share in perpetuity would be a mistake. Tesla had about 13% of total electric car market share in Western Europe last year, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. That lagged behind  Volkswagen  by about 10 percentage points.<br />Competitive concerns aside, the stock changed hands at 1,371 times trailing earnings as of Wednesday. Even that cartoonishly large multiple provides false comfort: In the fourth quarter, Tesla earned $270 million in net income but sold $401 million in regulatory credits to other auto makers needing to meet emissions mandates, primarily in Europe. Before tax, those revenues carry 100% profit margins. Tesla’s credit sales have significantly outpaced net income for five consecutive quarters, and those credits might become less valuable over time, as more manufacturers step up electric car production.</td>

      <td>American Financial Group Inc.  on Wednesday said it agreed to sell its annuity business to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. in a $3.5 billion cash deal.<br />The acquisition will deliver new ways for the giant Springfield, Mass., company, one of the nation’s oldest life insurers, to sell its products. MassMutual has long had one of the biggest fleets of career agents in the U.S., and the deal will add opportunities to sell through banks, independent broker dealers and independent agents, analysts said.<br />American Financial said the transaction will mark its exit from the market for fixed and indexed annuities, which are popular retirement products with conservative savers. It will focus more tightly on its property-and-casualty insurance operations.<br />The Cincinnati-based insurer is the latest U.S. insurer to divest annuity operations, as ultralow interest rates pressure companies’ abilities to earn healthy profits on the product line.<br />The transaction is the third life-insurance-industry transaction in a week and one of many over a decade of frenzied industrywide activity, as insurers have been narrowing their focus and divesting product lines, much of it motivated by the low interest-rate environment. Insurers invest customers’ premiums until needed to pay claims, so low rates make many products challenging to profitably sell.</td>

Burning cash at a rate of roughly $100 million a month, AMC last month began selling stock to the public with a bankruptcy warning attached, saying that a failure to raise enough capital could mean chapter 11.<br />On Monday, Chief Executive Adam Aron said the risk of an imminent bankruptcy was “off the table” after investors poured in $917 million in debt and equity financing, though AMC cautioned investors that its future cash needs are still uncertain as no one knows for sure the future course of the coronavirus and its mutating strains.</td>

      <td>Tech stocks’ gyrations and several looming challenges left the social network’s investors unimpressed with a strong quarter and encouraging near-term trends.</td>
      <td>Investors who could pry themselves away from Reddit on Wednesday afternoon found  Facebook  much more soothing—the company’s results, that is.<br />The social-media giant reported monster fourth-quarter results. Total revenue grew by 33% year-over-year—well above Wall Street’s estimate—driven by advertising revenue growth of 31%. Given easy comparables as a result of the pandemic, the company said that it expects year-over-year growth rates to remain stable or to accelerate modestly in the first half of 2021. They will appear less flattering, however, in the second half of the year—a time when the company says it also could face pressure from ad targeting and regulatory headwinds.<br />Facebook has lagged behind the Nasdaq Composite Index and social-media competitors  Twitter ,   Snap Inc.  and Pinterest over the last year as such risks loomed. But the company should find relative shelter in its diversity. Analysts are expecting daily active users on the platform to continue to grow sequentially in the first quarter, alleviating some investors’ concerns of attrition following the platform’s January suspension of former President Donald Trump. That makes sense: Analysts forecast the U.S. and Canada will account for only about 10% of Facebook’s daily active users world-wide in the first quarter, according to Visible Alpha. Advertisers should continue to find superior value in Facebook’s platform relative to competitors.<br />Investors also have worried for months now about the revenue impact of  Apple ’s  impending iOS update, which will hamper advertisers’ ability to track users’ data in order to market themselves and monetize their ads on Facebook’s platform. But  Morgan Stanley ’s  Brian Nowak argues that Facebook’s breadth and differentiation will soften the blow. He estimates the iOS change would amount to just a 1% to 3% revenue loss in 2021 for Facebook, and he also notes that all platforms affected by Apple’s update will see their advertisers’ return on investment take a hit. Facebook, in other words, isn’t alone. Yet another concern is possible antitrust suits from regulators, but here Facebook also has company, and such suits can take years to play out.<br />Meanwhile, the fundamentals look promising: Truist’s Youssef Squali says Facebook’s more-than-8-million advertisers will help it “absorb some of the shock from negative externalities” such as the pandemic, future ad boycotts and regulatory and platform changes. Wall Street is expecting Facebook to grow ad revenue at an average pace of more than 29% year-over-year in the first and second quarter, according to FactSet, leaving room for upside based on the company’s guidance.</td>

      <td>Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s recently ascended leaders said Wednesday that the global casino operator’s future will hew closely to the vision of company founder Sheldon Adelson, who died earlier this month.<br />The company will continue to invest in its Singapore and Macau casinos, which generate most of the company’s revenue, and consider expansion opportunities in the U.S. in New York and Texas, company officials said on a call with Wall Street analysts Wednesday.<br />“The DNA of the company that Sheldon founded will be ever present,” said Sands Chief Executive Rob Goldstein, who was named Mr. Adelson’s successor this week.<br />Sands reported a 67% decline in revenue for the quarter that ended Dec. 31, the first such report since Mr. Adelson’s death. The casino magnate died Jan. 11 from complications of treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 87. The company began when Mr. Adelson and partners bought the old Sands Hotel casino on the Las Vegas Strip in 1989.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic has roiled the casino industry with temporary shutdowns, reduced travel and limited occupancies under social-distancing. Hopes for a recovery this year depend on how many tourists and business travelers will return as vaccines are distributed.</td>

Justice Department officials said the charge may be the first of its kind.<br />Douglass Mackey—whose alleged alias, Ricky Vaughn, was behind a highly trafficked alt-right Twitter account—is accused in a federal complaint in Brooklyn of working with others to design and distribute tweets telling people they could vote by texting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s name to a telephone code. Around Election Day 2016, at least 4,900 unique phone numbers texted Mrs. Clinton’s name or some derivative to a number provided by the alleged misinformation campaign, prosecutors said.<br />The criminal complaint charges Mr. Mackey with one count: conspiring to deprive people of their right to vote. Department of Justice officials described the charge as unusual, and a department spokesman said Mr. Mackey may be the first defendant to be charged with election-interference crimes stemming from social-media posts.<br />The complaint doesn’t identify Mrs. Clinton by name, referring to her instead as “the Candidate,” but a person familiar with the investigation confirmed it referred to the former senator and secretary of state.<br />Mr. Mackey, 31 years old, was arrested in Palm Beach on Wednesday and was released on $50,000 bond after an appearance in federal court in Florida. A court-appointed lawyer for Mr. Mackey declined to comment.</td>

      <td>Job losses in 2020 were far higher in states that loved lockdowns.</td>
      <td>Recall the political panic after the Labor Department reported 140,000 job losses in December? Well, the government’s state employment report released Tuesday shows those losses were largely related to state lockdowns, and jobs are rebounding rapidly in less restrictive states.<br />Despite the virus surge, employment increased in 15 states last month including Texas (64,200), Georgia (44,700), North Carolina (33,600), Wisconsin (15,100) and South Carolina (14,600). But these gains were more than offset by losses in Michigan (-64,400), California (-52,200), Minnesota (-49,800), Pennsylvania (-37,600) and New York (-37,200).<br />Democratic governors of the latter states shut down indoor dining (and outdoors in California), so not surprisingly nearly all of their job losses were in leisure and hospitality. Yet most states added jobs across industries, especially trade and transportation, and some including Georgia and Texas even added thousands in leisure and hospitality.<br />This underlines that the economy and jobs were recovering in most states before Congress passed its $900 billion relief bill and Joe Biden became President. The states that are struggling most imposed excessive business shutdowns, which didn’t control the virus any better than states that allowed business to operate with social distancing.<br />Note the nearby table that shows 10 states with the largest employment declines from December 2019 to December 2020: Hawaii (-13.8%) has suffered from unique tourism losses, but how do you explain Michigan (-10.9%), New York (-10.4%), Massachusetts (-9.1%) and the others if not by the degree of their lockdowns? Most lost jobs were in leisure and hospitality, as well as health care, education and manufacturing.</td>

      <td>President Biden wants to give states $130 billion more in Covid relief, but he may need more after Wednesday. The oil and gas lease moratorium on federal lands that he announced will erase thousands of blue-collar jobs—and billions of dollars in revenue that states use to fund education.<br />The feds split mineral royalties with the states, many of which rely on the revenue to balance their budgets. Some states also impose general receipts taxes on oil and gas production. Wyoming state superintendent Jillian Balow notes that her state depends on some $150 million a year in oil and gas federal royalties to fund K-12 schools.<br />A University of Wyoming study last month estimated that a federal leasing moratorium could cost states on average $1.6 billion annually in tax revenue. New Mexico ($946 million), Wyoming ($304 million), and North Dakota ($136 million) would be hit hardest, though Colorado, Alaska, Utah and Montana would also lose tens of millions of dollars.<br />Because state, private and federal lands are interspersed in a checkerboard pattern, as the study notes, Mr. Biden’s ban will effectively limit production on much private and state land too. Job losses will also reduce income and sales tax revenues.<br />Notably, Mr. Biden’s order exempts Native American tribal lands and says “The Secretary of the Interior shall engage with Tribal authorities regarding the development and management of renewable and conventional energy resources on Tribal lands.” States also have sovereign rights under the Constitution. Why isn’t the Administration engaging with them?</td>

      <td>Record-breaking quarter comes as stock has already reached a record high valuation</td>
      <td>$100 billion should feel better than this.<br />Apple Inc.  crossed that milestone by generating $111.4 billion in revenue during its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 26. That is not only a record for the tech giant, it was nearly 8% above Wall Street’s targets and represented a gain of 21% from the same period last year—Apple’s best growth rate in more than five years.<br />That growth can be credited to strength across the company’s product segments with the latest iPhone updates leading the way. Revenue for the smartphone line rose 17% from a year earlier to a record-high $65.5 billion. Service revenue jumped 24%, a notable acceleration from the midteens growth seen in the last several periods. And despite launching new iPhone designs packed with expensive 5G radio chips, Apple’s bottom line exploded. Operating income jumped 31% year over year to $33.5 billion, producing an operating margin above 30% for the first time since late 2015.<br />A stellar quarter, in other words, especially against the backdrop of a global pandemic that worsened significantly during the quarter. But investors seemed unimpressed: Apple’s share price slipped nearly 3% in after-hours trading following the results and conference call—one in which Apple continued to refrain from giving a forecast for the current quarter, citing continued uncertainty created by the continuing pandemic.<br />Part of the tepid reaction may be because of dynamics beyond Apple’s control, such as a newfound love among retail investors for beaten down names.  BlackBerry ,  the once-mighty smartphone maker that was nearly vanquished by the first iPhones, has seen its share price more than double in the past week. But Apple’s been a hot stock in its own right, with its shares surging 84% over the past 12 months. That has put them at a record-high multiple of around 35 times forward earnings. And the passing of the holiday quarter and iPhone launch naturally brings questions about what Apple might do next—an area the company is always  to discuss. So investors just have the most recent quarter to act on, and that blockbuster was already well priced in.</td>

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.<br />On Monday Mr. Schumer called for President Biden to declare a national climate emergency, which would give the new Administration sweeping authority to circumvent Congress. This echoes Donald Trump’s declaration of a phony immigration emergency in 2019 to divert money from other federal accounts to build his wall on the Southern border.<br />“Now, Trump used this emergency for a stupid wall, which wasn’t an emergency,” Mr. Schumer said on MSNBC. “But if there ever was an emergency, climate is one. So I would suggest that they explore looking at climate as an emergency, which would give them more flexibility.”<br />By “flexibility,” Mr. Schumer means unilateral power to redirect federal funds for climate projects and subsidies, block oil exports, suspend drilling projects and perhaps stop the transport of all fossil fuels. All of this would be illegal in our view without explicit Congressional approval, and would be challenged in court, but the “emergency” strategy has been emerging on the left for some time.<br />We warned Republicans that Democrats would cite Mr. Trump’s use of emergency powers as a precedent for their policies. And now here we are.</td>

Susan Collins (R., Maine) and Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.) comes a day after just five Republicans sided with Democrats in a vote testing lawmakers’ stances on whether the trial was constitutional. The trial is set to begin in earnest in February, and Democrats would need support from at least 17 Republicans to convict Mr. Trump.<br />Tuesday’s vote showed it is “extremely unlikely that President Trump would be convicted,” Ms. Collins said. “It seems to me that there is some value in looking at an alternative to proceeding with the trial.” Ms. Collins was one of the handful of senators to side with Democrats in the vote.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) rejected the suggestion that the Senate should set aside the trial and said Wednesday that the Senate would proceed as planned. “Make no mistake—there will be a trial, and the evidence against the former president will be presented in living color,” he said. He said the constitutional objections to the trial were an attempt by Republicans to avoid having to cast judgment on Mr. Trump’s actions.<br />Mr. Trump’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</td>

Mr. Biden was celebrated for beginning the “healing,” punching plenty of “reset buttons” and extending a much-needed “olive branch.”<br />His inaugural address was “grand and deeply intimate,” a “balm for a wounded nation.” Mr. Biden “met the challenge” simply by appearing at his swearing-in “at a moment of profound national vulnerability.” One veteran observer admitted it left him “in a bit of a swoon.” I’m sure it did.<br />It’s understandable that so many in the media hailed Mr. Biden’s ascension to the Oval Office.

But looking beyond the paeans, the new president is off to a soggy start, with too many discrepancies between declared intentions and subsequent actions.<br />Mr. Biden frequently calls for bipartisanship, but that will require his leadership. He will have to work with Republican leaders to find areas of agreement before surfacing legislation. On Covid-19 stimulus, the president did nothing of the sort. Instead, he laid out his initiative without consulting Republicans and included several provisions and a $1.9 trillion price tag he knew were unacceptable to GOP lawmakers. Now, rather than quickly passing a bipartisan bill that strengthens vaccinations and gives the new administration an early victory, we hear talk of Democrats ramming Covid relief through on a party-line vote using the reconciliation procedure.</td>

      <td>Cliff Levy is promoted to deputy managing editor, will develop procedures for vetting audio content in interim role</td>
      <td>The  New York Times  said it assigned a top editor to develop procedures to vet stories from its audio unit, a part of the business that is growing quickly but has drawn criticism recently over its “Caliphate” series.<br />Cliff Levy, who has been the news outlet’s Metro editor since 2018, was promoted to deputy managing editor. He will provide guidance on an interim basis to Sam Dolnick, who oversees the paper’s audio unit as well as its film and television projects, and executive audio producer Lisa Tobin.<br />Mr. Levy said in an interview that “bringing newsroom sensibilities” to the audio group is part of the reason for his new assignment. Addressing the problems related to the “Caliphate” series, which caused the Times to issue a major correction in December, “is one part,” he said.<br />The Times has made audio a focus in its digital expansion efforts, as podcasts grow in popularity with listeners and advertisers. U.S. ad spending on podcasts was up 14.7% in 2020 to nearly $1 billion, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.<br />The Times’s flagship podcast, “The Daily,” is regularly among the most-downloaded podcasts. The publisher doesn’t break out its audio unit’s financial results. The unit generated about $29 million in revenue in 2019, a person familiar with the matter said, about 11% of overall digital ad revenue that year. The revenue figure was earlier reported by Business Insider.</td>

      <td>The losses from finding new servers will be dwarfed by the gains from all the free publicity.</td>
      <td>The coordinated actions of Big Tech against Parler, a free-speech competitor to  Twitter ,  have attracted much attention and debate. Some argue that deplatforming Parler was necessary to stop further violence after the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Others see political discrimination at work, given that  Facebook ,  YouTube and Twitter also host bad actors. Everyone seems to agree that the actions by Big Tech caused great harm to Parler.<br />On the contrary, there are strong economic reasons to think Parler will benefit in the long run. The value of the free publicity will ultimately far outweigh the loss of revenue from being shut down for a few weeks. Parler has become a household name. It was a company; now it’s a cause.<br />The attack on Parler follows a long history of incumbent monopolies trying to raise costs on new rivals. Once Parler gets new servers up, however, using a phone to sign up or log on through a browser rather than an app is a small barrier to entry. Many highly profitable websites have no apps.<br />The benefits to Parler from Big Tech’s actions come in the long haul. The value of any company stems from the present value of its future earnings. An investment raises this present value when the up-front cost is dwarfed by the gains in future earnings. Big Tech has made an implicit investment in Parler by imposing a short-run cost that is smaller than the more lasting future gain in earnings enabled by the free marketing campaign.<br />The growth in future users doesn’t have to be large to raise the value of Parler. It seems safe to assume that the number of users will be larger in March this year than it would have been without the Big Tech effort. And the growth doesn’t have to be huge to make a big difference. Losing 100% of a month’s earnings to switch servers is easily made up by a long-run gain of a few percentage points of monthly users afterward. Such a small gain seems more than likely given the multiples of 100% growth in Parler users after Twitter’s suppression of stories about Hunter Biden’s business dealings.</td>

      <td>‘The number of Americans who need to be deprogrammed is in the ‘millions.’’</td>
      <td>From a Jan. 26 New York Sun editorial:<br /><br />Following are the procedures for deprogramming The New York Sun. We offer them in light of Katie Couric’s swipe at Trump supporters. “The question,” she told Bill Maher, “is how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump.” The Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson reckons the number of Americans who need to be deprogrammed is in the “millions.” . . .<br />Step 1. Disconnecting the Republican solenoid. This device was installed after the Civil War by the Sun’s new proprietor, Charles Dana. Before the war, Dana had been fired from the Tribune by that jackanapes Horace Greeley, who’d endorsed Southern secession, to which Dana’d objected. Whereupon Dana got hired by Abe Lincoln to cover the war for one reader — the president. . . .<br />Step 2. Lifting out the gold core. This system of measuring value was installed in the 19th century, when William Jennings Bryan ran for president on a platform of inflation. . . . The Sun sided with gold.</td>

      <td>In the face of extinctions, a writer’s call to cherish the voices that make a symphony out of the natural world.</td>
      <td>For half a century, philosopher Kathleen Dean Moore has written about the natural world, her work shaped by the homes she’s made in Corvallis, Ore., and Chichaghof Island, Alaska. It’s also indebted to the conservationist and writer Rachel Carson (1907-1964), best known for “Silent Spring,” the landmark 1962 book in which she envisioned a world eerily hushed by pesticides. “I imagine,” Ms. Moore writes of Carson, “she called the book ‘Silent Spring’ . . . because it was the loss of the birds’ music that would grieve her the most.”<br />Ms. Moore adores birdsong, too, though in “Earth’s Wild Music: Celebrating and Defending the Songs of the Natural World” she details the threat of a broader quiet across the planet if humanity fails to heed warnings about the extinction crisis and other environmental challenges before us. “In the fifty years that I have been writing about nature,” she laments, “roughly 60 percent of all individual mammals have been erased from the face of the Earth. The total population of North American birds, the red-winged blackbirds and robins, has been cut by a third. Half of grassland birds have been lost. Butterflies and moths have declined by similar percentages. As individual numbers decrease, species are being lost, too. As many as one out of five species of organisms may be on the verge of extinction now, and twice that number could be lost by the end of the century.”<br />Given its subject matter, “Earth’s Wild Music” is necessarily a serious book, but its moral insights are occasionally leavened with humor. Ms. Moore is a fervent nature lover, sometimes comically so. She finds it grand when a woodpecker rat-a-tat-tats her roof in the wee hours of an Alaskan morning, breaking her sleep, though the author’s sister suggests earplugs. Ms. Moore grieves when a new roof proves less welcoming to the noisy critter and devises largely fruitless expedients to lure him back. She overcomes a fear of caves and enters one in Arizona, and, on a desert campout, she not only accepts the presence of rattlesnakes but goes out looking for them—at night. And while others might be put off by the spines of a saguaro cactus, Ms. Moore thrums them like a guitar. “If a person is patient in her plucking,” she notes, “she can play music” on the prickly plant.<br />The straight man for Ms. Moore’s quixotic adventures is her husband of many years, Frank Moore, a retired neuroendocrinologist whom she affectionately describes as “tall and strong . . . ruddy as a ponderosa pine.” He’s also dying of a cancer working “quietly behind the scenes.” The mere thought of his absence, she mentions in a passage that brings a lump to the reader’s throat, brings what she calls “anticipatory loneliness.”<br />Ms. Moore considers the possibility of an even wider loss—the souring of seas, the withering of forests, and the wholesale disappearance of many kinds of life, which she regards as a form of spiritual impoverishment, too. “My nightmare is that before we lose the Earth’s life-sustaining systems, we will lose its soul-sustaining system—the Earth’s wild music,” she writes.</td>
