      <td>Confirmation secured with fewer votes for any Fed governor since at least 1980</td>
      <td>The Senate confirmed one of President Trump’s picks Thursday to a vacancy on the Federal Reserve’s board of governors in a vote that reflected increased partisan tensions over issues related to the looming change in presidential administrations.<br />Christopher Waller, the research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, was confirmed on a 48-47 vote to a term that runs through January 2030. He has attended meetings of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year in his capacity at the St. Louis Fed. He headed the University of Notre Dame’s economics department before joining the regional Fed bank in 2009.<br />Analysts said the largely party-line confirmation vote may have had less to do with specific objections to Mr. Waller’s qualifications, but showed Democrats’ broader frustrations with how the Trump administration has managed financial-policy and personnel issues during the lame-duck period. For example, the Treasury Department last month declined to renew emergency Fed lending facilities that will expire on Dec. 31.<br />Five of 12 Democrats had voted in July to advance Mr. Waller’s nomination out of the Senate Banking Committee, but he received no backing from Democrats on Thursday. One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, also opposed his confirmation.<br />The confirmation marked the first time the Senate had seated a governor in a lame-duck period that follows the November election before the president’s term ends in January, according to Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania.</td>

      <td>Luminar Technologies Inc.,  which produces sensor technology for self-driving cars, started trading publicly Thursday and made its 25-year-old founder and chief executive a billionaire.<br />Austin Russell began Luminar in 2012 at age 17, when he left Stanford University and accepted a fellowship from the foundation of entrepreneur and venture capitalist Peter Thiel to develop the company. Mr. Russell will retain 83% of the voting power in Luminar and serve as its chairman.<br />Luminar “spent a huge amount of time just figuring out what was possible,” Mr. Russell said. “In some ways, it’s awesome and surreal to be a part of this, going public. In other ways, it just makes a lot of sense.”<br />The company makes lidar scanners, which use pulsed lasers to sense distances to nearby targets. In self-driving cars, the technology helps onboard computers create a picture of surrounding obstacles such as other cars and pedestrians in order to avoid collisions. The technology has notable critics—including Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk—but Luminar has said it sees its total addressable market growing from about $5 billion currently to $150 billion by 2030.<br />Luminar is another example of a company making its market debut after getting acquired by a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which are publicly traded shell companies formed to pursue deals. Luminar was acquired in August by Gores Metropoulos Inc. Other companies that have gone public via a SPAC this year include  Nikola Corp. ,  DraftKings Inc.  and  Fisker Inc.</td>

      <td>Andrew Abela says that success of a corporation “cannot be reduced solely to profitability.” And why not?</td>
      <td>In “Woke Capitalism in a Secular World” (Houses of Worship, Nov. 27), Andrew Abela says that success of a corporation “cannot be reduced solely to profitability.” And why not? Mr. Abela claims that corporations should be driven by “principles” derived from faith or “some other lasting, existential commitment” instead of the latest progressive causes. But the principles of faith, at least as understood in 2020 America, are subjective, subject to shifting social mores and the differing beliefs of individual corporate executives. Profitability has the benefit of being more objective while, as any student of Milton Friedman knows, providing the most social utility.<br />Anthony Kroger<br />Houston<br /><br />Mr. Abela laments the Business Roundtable’s redefined purpose of a corporation as having been hijacked by a woke movement that has companies becoming politically active. He suggests that companies should not be engaging in political activism, but instead should “work on the good that they were established to do.” But the more important point not mentioned is that companies and their CEOs are likely substituting these actions for the more substantive ones that the Business Roundtable recommended: “Rather than simply working in the interest of shareholders, the organization affirmed that companies also should commit to delivering value to customers, investing in employees, dealing fairly and ethically with suppliers, and supporting local communities.” The Business Roundtable’s principles were abandoned in the 1970s when American corporations embraced Milton Friedman’s pronouncement that businesses’ main purpose is to make as much money as possible for its shareholders. Had they not pursued Friedman’s policy, it is likely that we would not even be having a discussion of “woke capitalism” today.</td>

      <td>Ohio has done the right thing in cleaning up its voter rolls as an effective method of ensuring fair and honest elections for all its citizens.</td>
      <td>Jana Morgan’s letter “H.R. 1 Will Make America More Democratic” (Nov. 25) is typical of progressives’ demonization of those who disagree with their plans to corrupt election protocol. She accuses Kimberley Strassel of making a partisan attack on “any effort to improve our election system” (“Harvesting the 2020 Election,” Potomac Watch, Nov. 13). Ms. Morgan has made the classic error of conflating any attempt to criticize her pet bill with resisting any attempt at reform. She has the gall to criticize Ohio’s “purge” of its voter rolls. Shortly after voter rolls were updated there, Ohio voting patterns moved in a conservative direction. After the mess of this Nov. 3 election in Democratic-controlled states, I must conclude that the progressives’ desire to “count every vote” really means “count every vote that lands in a ballot box” regardless of its chain of custody or the legality of its arrival there. Ohio has done the right thing in cleaning up its voter rolls as an effective method of ensuring fair and honest elections for all its citizens.<br />Jim Cox<br />Xenia, Ohio<br /><br />Ms. Morgan responds to Ms. Strassel’s column on voter-integrity legislation proposal H.R. 1 by including the assertion that the bill would outlaw purging of voter rolls in any state of the names of those who have died or moved, including to another state. She states this as if that represents a prima facie improvement to election laws. If having a long-dead person’s name listed on active-voter rolls aides vote integrity, it certainly isn’t apparent why that is. If that condition helps potential cheaters, that appears obvious. Her assertion indicates a chasm in thought that leaves me baffled.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden is under pressure from several groups within the Democratic Party as he weighs more cabinet picks, with Black and Latino lawmakers discussing coordinating efforts to try to sway his selections for top jobs.<br />Members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus have been in touch with Mr. Biden’s transition team to encourage him to increase diversity at the highest levels of the government. Some of those members are now discussing tactics to elevate their preferred contenders, including possibly aligning their endorsements. They haven’t reached an agreement on their strategy, according to people familiar with the discussions, but one approach would be to choose one Black or Latino candidate to recommend for a handful of top remaining positions.<br />"The African-American and Latino communities rallied behind this administration and their expectations are to be included at all levels,” said Rep. Bennie Thompson (D, Miss.), who has spoken with the Biden transition team.<br />The efforts underscore the pressures Mr. Biden faces as he builds out his administration. In addition to demands that he increase the diversity across his cabinet nominees, Mr. Biden is navigating the party’s progressive base and his pledge to govern as a consensus builder. Some of the candidates being pushed by Black and Latino groups don’t have the backing of progressive groups, and vice versa.<br />Mr. Biden’s team so far has included a number of firsts for women and minorities. They include his choice of Alejandro Mayorkas, who is Cuban-American, to be the first Latino and first immigrant to lead the Department of Homeland Security, and Cecilia Rouse, who would be the first Black chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Biden named another Black woman, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, as his nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, and has appointed more than a dozen people of color to senior White House roles.</td>

It couldn’t be learned when Mr. Biden would make the announcement.<br />Mr. Biden’s transition team declined to comment, and Mr. Zients didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />The Democratic president-elect is expected to fill health-care positions in his administration as coronavirus cases continue to surge across the country. The number of Covid-19-related deaths reported in a day hit a record in the U.S. this week, and newly reported infections were at their second highest level, surpassing 200,000 for the second time in less than a week.<br />Mr. Zients, a business executive, led the National Economic Council during much of then-President Barack Obama’s second term. Before that, he was a senior official and acting director at the White House Office of Management and Budget. He also played a lead role in helping to fix problems with the administration’s health-care website.</td>

      <td>Falling demand for U.S. coal during the coronavirus pandemic continues to take a heavy financial toll on the industry, tipping two more coal production companies into bankruptcy.<br />White Stallion Energy LLC and Lighthouse Resources Inc. filed for chapter 11 protection Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. The companies, which own mines in Illinois, Indiana, Montana and Wyoming, blamed the bankruptcy filings largely on low thermal coal prices and declining coal consumption at U.S. power plants.<br />The chapter 11 filings are the latest in a string of defaults by American coal companies, highlighting how a downturn in coal markets exacerbated by Covid-19 is straining an industry that was already in decline.<br />The U.S. power sector consumed 30% less coal in the first half of 2020 than during the same period last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The coal industry also has been facing competition from natural gas, a lower-cost fuel alternative, and the continuing retirement of coal-fired power plants.<br />Evansville, Ind.-based White Stallion said in court papers it is idling its mining operations and had terminated all of its roughly 260 employees just before filing for chapter 11, citing a severe cash crunch. Before filing for bankruptcy, White Stallion obtained a $10 million Covid-19 relief loan through the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program. The company is among hundreds of businesses that have gone into bankruptcy after obtaining a PPP loan.</td>

      <td>LOS ANGELES— AT&T Inc.’s  Warner Bros. will release its entire 2021 slate of theatrical films simultaneously in theaters and on its HBO Max streaming service, the studio said Thursday, taking the most drastic step yet in eliminating the exclusivity theater chains have enjoyed for decades.<br />Warner Bros. movies will play on HBO Max during their first month of theatrical release before leaving the service while staying in theaters.<br />The hybrid model will apply to all of Warner Bros. films next year, from smaller-scale releases to big-budget movies that traditionally require gargantuan box-office sales to turn a profit. That includes the science-fiction adaptation “Dune,” a movie version of the musical “In The Heights” and a new installment of the “Matrix” franchise.<br />Warner Bros. last month said it was going to release “Wonder Woman 1984” on HBO Max Christmas Day for a month at the same time the movie went into theaters. The announcement Thursday covers 17 films that are scheduled for release next year.<br />“It’s threading a needle in the middle of a pandemic,” said Carolyn Blackwood, the studio’s chief operating officer. “We weren’t comfortable sitting on our hands or punting these movies into oblivion.”</td>

It claimed that the collection and counting of absentee ballots in two populous and heavily Democratic counties, Milwaukee and Dane, were marred by systemic violations of state election laws, and that around 220,000 of 3 million votes cast statewide should have been excluded from recount totals.<br />Thursday’s ruling follows a string of unsuccessful lawsuits elsewhere and comes after battleground states have certified results showing Mr. Biden won the election, leaving Mr. Trump with no known path to reversing the outcome in the courts. It also came as a Dec. 8 deadline approaches for states to finalize election results and choose electors ahead of a meeting of the Electoral College a week later.<br />Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday said the Justice Department hasn’t found evidence of widespread voter fraud that would alter the outcome of the election.</td>

      <td>Smaller celebrations still demand good wines. Scaled to suit this moment, half bottles offer other benefits, too. Here, our wine columnist’s top 5 smaller-format picks.</td>
      <td>ARE YOU an optimist or a pessimist by nature? Your feelings about wine in half bottles might offer a clue. Some consider half-bottles a disappointment: They hold only half as much wine. Others see a low-risk means of trying something new. After tasting a trove of wines in tinyish bottles, I think I fall somewhere in between the two types.<br />Half bottles are a conundrum. They offer oenophiles the opportunity to try a wine for much less money—even if, often, half bottles cost more than half the full-bottle price. They can give a preview of a vintage, since wine in half bottles ages more rapidly. (The amount of air trapped between cork and wine is the same in both sizes, so the ratio of air to wine is higher in a half bottle.) This makes half bottles more readily drinkable but less valuable, too, since ageability is a hallmark of a collectible wine.<br />Still, half bottles might be the right size right now. People are drinking alone thanks to pandemic-related restrictions on gathering at restaurants or bars, or at home with friends. And during the holidays, this size suits smaller groups of celebrants too.<br />Retail sales figures released by Nielsen last month show that retail sales of wine in half bottles were up 45.5% in the 4-week period ending Nov. 7 over the same period last year. Full-size bottles saw a 19% increase in the same time period.<br />More people are buying half bottles, but until I went out hunting bottles for this column, I was not among them. If I really like a wine, I’ll always opt for the full-size alternative. And the choice of wines in half bottles tends to be much more limited; many producers don’t make half bottles at all.</td>

      <td>The screen adaptation of the recent Broadway musical has a full dance floor of star power but is far from a night to remember.</td>
      <td>Seldom does a show-stopper also serve as a show-starter. That’s what happens in “The Prom,” but it’s no cause for celebration, even though this Netflix version of the recent Broadway musical has been equipped with an exceptional cast that includes Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman and James Corden. For much of its 130-minute running time the production, directed by Ryan Murphy, suffers from excessive self-delight, chronic glee and a surfeit of joyishness, along with splotches of sentimentality, and doesn’t start to come alive with unforced energy until one of its stars launches into a song-and-dance number that lasts for four truly delightful minutes.<br />The main action begins with an open-and-shut case on Broadway. A couple of aging stage stars, Ms. Streep’s Dee Dee Allen and Mr. Corden’s Barry Glickman, open in “Eleanor!”—a would-be rollicking musical about Eleanor Roosevelt. The reviews are so brutal that the show closes the same night, with the most withering critical scorn directed at the actors themselves—not for choosing a ludicrous vehicle but for being insufferable narcissists.<br />How, then, can they revive their careers? By becoming celebrity activists, they decide in a flash, and finding a cause to champion. Their vague notion quickly turns specific when Dee Dee and Barry learn that the head of the high school PTA in a small Indiana town has forbidden a student from bringing her girlfriend to the senior prom. Mission identified. The fallen stars will journey to the American heartland with two other friends whose careers are on the rocks—Angie Dickinson, not the actress but a dancer played by Ms. Kidman, and a Juilliard-trained thespian, Trent Oliver (Andrew Rannells)—and they’ll support the beleaguered girl with all the well-publicized selflessness they can muster.<br />The premise is a good one because it sets up a collision between the smug Broadway liberals and the resolutely conservative locals, with the earnest lesbian student caught in the crossfire. (Her name is Emma Nolan and she’s played appealingly by Jo Ellen Pellman. Ariana DeBose is Emma’s closeted girlfriend, Alyssa Greene. Alyssa’s mother, the PTA lady, is played by Kerry Washington.) But there are challenges as well, starting with the need for a sharp but generous take on the actors’ vanity and condescension. I didn’t see the well-received Broadway show, but I have the word of my colleague Terry Teachout who, in his review, wrote that Dee Dee, Barry and the others were “drawn with wicked exactitude.”<br />Many words could be used to describe the movie’s approach, but exactitude isn’t among them. Untethered exuberance comes closer. The stars are obviously having great fun in their roles, and we’re up for sharing it: Who doesn’t want to see a cast like this succeed? Yet the characters and situations are oversold from the opening scenes, and it’s not a problem of technique—these virtuosos can do anything that’s asked of them—but of directorial choice in a movie that still has one foot on a theater stage. The performances are many sizes too big for the camera, notwithstanding Matthew Libatique’s elegant lighting and cinematography.</td>

      <td>By episode 3 of “Your Honor,” Bryan Cranston’s beleaguered Judge Michael Desiato is sitting in a New Orleans dive, drinking whiskey and listening to Leonard Cohen—worse, discussing Leonard Cohen with the only other barfly in the place. Do we feel sorry for him? One of the distinguishing characteristics of “Your Honor” is how little sympathy we’re meant to feel for anyone, other than the dead being left behind.<br />Motives, miscues and the best intentions gone horribly awry provide the dramatic momentum of this 10-part thriller, created by the U.K.’s Peter Moffat, whose characters here are all morally amorphous entities doing what they think is best and making up for it later. Everyone is calculating his or her next move; nothing is casual. The reason Michael goes to that New Orleans bar at all is in pursuit of the questionable objective he’s had all along: preventing his son, Adam (Hunter Doohan), from being revealed as the culprit in a horrific hit-and-run that claimed the life of a young motorcyclist named Rocco (Benjamin Hassan Wadsworth).<br />Michael knows that he and Adam should go to the police. But before they can, he realizes who the dead kid was—the child of Jimmy and Gina Baxter (Michael Stuhlbarg and Hope Davis), vicious mobsters with tentacles everywhere in the city’s underworld. The judge knows what will happen if the facts come out. He has to save his son. So he constructs a wobbly tower of lies and misdirection that threatens to crush the lives—professional, political and otherwise—of everyone he knows.<br />“Your Honor” is complicated, but good complicated: The impulses of the players are understandable. And even though the means are ruthless and the ends seemingly inevitable, one can still be startled by how things play out. The introductory calamity itself, foreshadowed luxuriously by director Edward Berger (who handles several episodes), is a stomach-churning convergence of bad luck, bad timing and vehicular malpractice: On the anniversary of his mother’s murder, the unsettled Adam is en route to the cemetery when he has an asthma attack, drops his inhaler, tries to retrieve it and collides with Rocco—who goes tumbling across an empty intersection. Adam stops. Rocco expires. Adam panics. Adam flees.<br />Without giving much away, not that I can (only four episodes were available for review), Michael looks at the situation and his son’s pathetic attempts to cover his tracks and asks his old pal, local congressman Charlie Figaro (a terrific Isiah Whitlock Jr.), to make the damaged car disappear. Charlie, who’s about to run for mayor, can make such things happen, and Michael tells him only that the car holds bad memories—it belonged to his wife. Charlie arranges for a street-gang-allied kid, Kofi Jones (Lamar Johnson), to steal the car; Michael, trying to create a plausible timeline for Adam, tells a detective friend, Nancy Costello (Amy Landecker), that the car was stolen the day of the accident. Everyone is so uncannily efficient at what they do that Kofi is arrested before the day is out, a motorcycle part falls from the car’s undercarriage, and the boy is hung out to dry. All this by the end of episode 2.</td>

      <td>Mads Mikkelsen stars in a Danish comedy about a group of friends who try to better their lives by tweaking their blood-alcohol levels.</td>
      <td>‘Another Round” is the bland English title of a brilliant Danish comedy originally called “Druk.” That means drink, or drinking, and it goes more directly to the essence of a story about four friends, all of them middle-aged high-school teachers, who transform their lives with alcohol consumed in the course of a cockeyed pseudo-scientific experiment. Yet drink, drinking or binge-drinking—there’s some of that too—can’t begin to convey the wild beauty and emotional depth of this film, which stars the great Mads Mikkelsen and was directed by Thomas Vinterberg from a script he wrote with his longtime collaborator Tobias Lindholm. It’s also the first feature, as far as I know, to display its characters’ real-time blood alcohol levels on screen.<br />Mr. Mikkelsen is Martin, a history teacher at a laid-back private school. The bright-faced seniors in his class are perfectly open to the proposition of learning about the past, but Martin is chronically unfocused in the present and his students are on to him—so much so that one young man stands up and walks out of the classroom in disgust. (Playing now in virtual theaters, the film goes to digital platforms on December 18.)<br />If you’re a James Bond fan you may remember Mr. Mikkelsen from his role as Le Chiffre, the villainous banker who bleeds from one eye in the 2006 “Casino Royale.” If you’re a devotee of superb acting you’ll remember him from the 2013 “The Hunt,” another Vinterberg-Lindholm collaboration, in which he plays a blameless kindergarten teacher accused of serial child-molestation. Denmark is a small country, but Mr. Mikkelsen looms large among the leading screen actors of our time. His wit is quick, his timing impeccable, and his characters always seem to have a rich inner life; he has a gift for suggesting who they were before they got to be who they are.<br />The Martin we see at the beginning of the film isn’t a drinker. He’s depressed and lost in lassitude—not quite a full-time tenant of his body. Yet we sense that he must have been formidably charming as a younger man, and that’s before we’re told by one of the friends in his group that he had been the best of them, a gifted scholar with a promising career.<br />The friend who conveys this information, an amiable psychology teacher named Nikolaj (Magnus Millang), is the one who proposes the drinking experiment in the course of a party the others have organized for his 40th birthday. The experiment, the teacher says, is based on the work of the Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skårderud, who has famously argued—this part is fact, not fiction—that humans are born with a blood alcohol deficit of 0.05%.</td>

      <td>Set in a pre-pandemic Toronto hospital, NBC’s series features an appealing cast and a healthy dose of hospital-drama clichés.</td>
      <td>Nurses deserve a show called “Nurses,” especially right now. Whether they deserve this particular “Nurses” is another story. Still, one can imagine an exhausted health-care worker coming home, grabbing a bite and curling up with the beautiful, beleaguered characters who populate the show’s Canadian hospital, where the pre-pandemic, single-payer problems will seem like so many common colds. Can you drift off to sleep while rolling your eyes?<br />Like NBC’s “Transplant,” another imported hit from up north, “Nurses” begins in normal times, in a normally chaotic Toronto hospital called St. Mary’s, where a diverse quintet of nurses arrives for its first day on the job. In a nod to tradition, the de-facto lead character is the blond, blue-eyed member of the group, Grace Knight (Tiera Skovbye), who also has the most ornate story: She was fired from her last job, under circumstances she’d rather not discuss, and is romantically involved with man who already has a fiancée. It will require further examination, but it appears the lover is involved in an arranged marriage-to-be, perhaps of the Indian variety.<br />Also Indian is Nazneen “Naz” Khan (Sandy Sidhu), daughter of a Bollywood star, who has never had a job before and yet has somehow landed in a prestigious facility where her shortcomings begin with not knowing how to make a bed. The pampered Naz is trying to get herself into the real working world, but she’s a natural target for the older, hardened staffers who’ve seen it all, and done it all, and quite obviously resent her for the way she makes her scrubs look like they came from Lululemon.<br />The others principals are the young, naïve nurse-with-a-secret Wolf Burke (Donald MacLean Jr.); former college football star Keon Colby (Jordan Johnson-Hinds); and the somewhat abrasive Ashley Collins (Natasha Calis), who when a white supremacist neo-Nazi comes under their care—after he’s driven into a crowd of pedestrians and filled the emergency room—seriously considers not treating him at all. “I wouldn’t be topping off his morphine drip,” she mutters. This is emotionally satisfying in the moment, but it does call into question the crew’s understanding of medical ethics.<br />The young, intrepid health professionals are all likable and played by very watchable actors who are saddled with dialogue that echoes hospital shows of every era. They’re also characters of somewhat amorphous definition—the doctors treat them like medical waste, yet they’re often smarter than the doctors and willing to contradict them or bail them out in the event of a misdiagnosis. Or nondiagnosis. The more experienced Grace bails out a young surgeon who freezes up in the operating room. In another case, she correctly guesses that meningitis is behind an ER patient’s wildly erratic behavior, which is initially written off to drug abuse or mental illness. Would we have drawn the same conclusion if he were white, she asks? Well, the guy was acting crazier than a rat in a can, so most viewers will be guessing yes, while appreciating the show’s interest in championing oppressed minorities, the most prominent of which is the nursing class itself.</td>

The company previously proposed stock sales in September and November, filing two separate shelf registrations to sell 30 million and 20 million shares, respectively.<br />Despite reopening the bulk of the company’s more than 1,000 cinemas world-wide, AMC is burning cash as capacity restrictions limit movie attendance and major Hollywood theaters delay big-ticket flicks or, increasingly, send them straight to streaming.  AT&T Inc.’s  Warner Bros. studio pushed back the release of “Wonder Woman 1984” until Christmas, while MGM Holdings Inc. has delayed the release of “No Time to Die,” a James Bond film, to April 2021.</td>

Tony Cárdenas to chair the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee, which oversees the strategy for the party’s House elections.<br />The vote total was 119 for Mr. Maloney and 107 for Mr. Cárdenas.<br />The soon-to-be five-term lawmaker campaigned on courting voters whom the party failed to reach in the 2020 cycle, including more conservative voters, saying he was aptly positioned to do so because he represents a district that President Trump won in 2016. He also plans to appoint people to look at Latino outreach and recruiting women to run for office.<br />Mr. Maloney has analyzed the party’s losses before. When Democrats were shocked at Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016 and other party losses that year, Mr. Maloney analyzed the DCCC’s operations.

      <td>A romance blossoms between an English fossil hunter and her unexpected guest in this film starring Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan.</td>
      <td>Instead of getting blood from stones, Mary Anning, the English paleontologist played by Kate Winslet in “Ammonite,” gets fossils, insights and wisdom. And behind the heroine’s stony visage lurks ardor that’s unfulfilled until another woman comes into her life. Francis Lee’s film, which co-stars Saoirse Ronan, is many things, all of them remarkable: a queer romance that finds passion in austerity; a biopic that strips away most details of Anning’s career while honoring its spirit; and a portrait of genius thwarted by gender—a scientist whose lonely existence is sustained by love of learning, even though, as a woman in the mid-19th century, she has achieved only a small fraction of the recognition, let alone fame, that she deserves. (The film, which has been playing in select theaters, is newly available on premium video on demand.)<br />The title derives from Mary’s work, cracking open ancient rocks to see what’s inside. She is far from ancient herself—Ms. Winslet gives her an outwardly calm beauty born of physical strength—but she could hardly be more closed off when we first meet her. An angry eccentric within sight of middle age, she is living with her elderly mother in a coastal town in West Dorset and supporting herself with a little shop where she sells tourists fossils of no scientific interest that she has found in the nearby cliffs. (She has already made a spectacular discovery, an ichthyosaur skeleton that is displayed in the British Museum, but her name on the label has been replaced by that of the man who purchased the fossil and donated it.)<br />Mary’s life changes when a young married couple show up at her shop. The husband, Roderick Murchison, is a geologist at the beginning of a European tour; he knows of Mary by reputation and declares his pleasure in meeting her. The wife, Charlotte, played exquisitely by Ms. Ronan, would have a classic pre-Raphaelite radiance if she weren’t suffering from what her husband calls mild melancholia and seems to be serious depression provoked by a miscarriage. Whatever the case, a fairly abrupt plot turn sends Roderick off on his tour while Charlotte remains behind to convalesce in Mary’s care.<br />That may suggest prompt bonding and a rapid thawing of Mary’s demeanor, but the opposite is true. In keeping with the spareness of the film as a whole, Mary’s bewilderment at her attraction to Charlotte gives way only gradually to her awakening. Their love starts as a mother-child relationship. When it finally opens out into physical rapture there’s still an anguishing realization on Mary’s part that Charlotte, once recovered, will go back to her husband in London, and to whatever world she can make for herself. Or will she? If there’s any fault to be found with “Ammonite,” it’s in the film’s deliberateness. Every step of the way is plotted with a clear purpose, and color-coded in Stéphane Fontaine’s cinematography, which is oppressively bleak until it warms and brightens in keeping with Mary’s evolution. Yet the ending isn’t clear at all. It’s a marvelous moment in which the only clarity comes from knowing that whatever may happen next, Mary will remain her own singular woman.<br />Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com</td>

The airline had pledged to avoid those measures this year. But in October the company told unions that the company would need them to agree to the equivalent of a 10% pay reduction to offset overstaffing costs. Without that, the company said, job losses in 2021 would be inevitable.<br />Russell McCrady, Southwest’s vice president of labor relations, said the notices were necessary as negotiations with unions have stalled, but added that the company would be willing to pick talks up again. “Our absolute goal is to preserve every job at Southwest Airlines,” he said in a statement Thursday.<br />Leaders of unions that represent Southwest’s pilots and flight attendants said they believed the notices were meant to pressure employees. “We see it as a heartless and cutthroat negotiating tactic,” said Jon Weaks, president of the union that represents Southwest’s pilots.<br />Rival carriers have furloughed tens of thousands of workers as the industry continues to bleed cash and executives believe it will take years for travel demand to return to the same levels as before the pandemic.</td>

For much of the labor force, the idea of checking off goals set during the comparatively rosy close of 2019 now seems quaint. Many markets have shifted dramatically, teams have been redeployed, and workers are often doing the jobs of departed colleagues in addition to trying on the role of teacher or caregiver for a chunk of the workday.<br />In response, some companies are scrapping parts of their performance-management systems, like mid-year reviews and numeric ratings. Others are lowering sales quotas and instituting a sort of performance-score inflation, urging bosses to avoid doling out that dreaded “does not meet expectations” label.<br />It’s all part of a pandemic-driven management style called empathetic leadership. To be sure, some bosses remain unmoved, expecting things to march on as if nothing has changed. But many say these days they are recognizing—and evaluating—the employee as a whole person and not just a worker bee.<br /></td>

      <td>BEING HOME for the holidays is bound to feel different this year: Nearly 75% of Americans plan to do their best to celebrate with family and friends virtually according to a recent OnePoll survey conducted for Asurion Home+—with 93% of respondents blaming Covid-19.<br />But even if you spend the holiday season alone, you needn’t feel lonely. The dumpster fire that is 2020 has yielded at least one upside: The widespread adoption of social tech has made everyone more-or-less comfortable with shared digital experiences, from work meetings to big family meals and, implausibly, weddings.<br />Virtual communing is no longer limited to Zoom calls with relatives who can’t quite master unmuting: New app features offer an interactive e-gathering experience, which can be more meaningful than lifeless video chats said Jeremy Birnholtz, director of the Social Media Lab and associate professor of communication studies at Northwestern University. “Assuming you’re going to get the exact feelings out of online interactions as an in-person one isn’t realistic. But online interactions can help preserve relationships.”<br />Bradley Keys, a Santa Monica, Calif., marketing director, was worried that his annual Christmas Eve viewing of “The Polar Express” with family and friends would be ruined by the pandemic. Then he found a way for them to join his celebration from wherever they happened to be holed up: “This year, we’ll be using the Rave to watch together from a distance,” he said. The Rave app lets users sync up their  Netflix ,   Amazon  Prime and YouTube screenings and text or voice chat during the show.<br />To take his family’s annual Yuletide game nights virtual, Tal Shelef, co-founder of a real-estate listing site in Toronto, turned to the Houseparty app. “We’ve celebrated Game Night as a family tradition since I was a kid,” he said. “It keeps family gatherings exciting, diffuses tensions and helps everyone relax.” Houseparty lets up to eight people per “room” share face-to-face video as they play.

Some of the claims grew out of a sweeping corruption scandal in Brazil that focused on bribery of officials at state-controlled  Petróleo Brasileiro SA,  also known as Petrobras.<br />The deal includes a deferred-prosecution agreement that allows Vitol to escape charges if it stays out of trouble for three years. The company will also pay an additional $45 million in a coordinated settlement with Brazilian authorities, according to U.S. prosecutors.<br />The investigation of Vitol, accused of paying millions in bribes over a decade, also involved the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The fine paid to the CFTC, a civil regulatory agency, wasn’t disclosed at Thursday’s court hearing.<br />Vitol, a private company, trades 8 million barrels a day of crude oil and also manages upstream assets and refineries, according to its website.

But it wasn’t until Covid-19 sent millions of people home to work remotely that Salesforce came to terms with the app maker—agreeing to pay more than 50% above Slack’s closing price the day before The Wall Street Journal broke news of the talks.<br />Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Bret Taylor, one of the architects of the $27.7 billion deal, including cash and debt, said that how its customers and the wider business world reacted to the health crisis, by more rapidly adopting digital tools, drove the two companies together.<br />“The technology that Slack made felt more relevant than ever before. That really motivated us to get into these discussions now,” Mr. Taylor said in an interview.<br />The deal will transform Salesforce into one of the largest players in business software, and, analysts say, help turn it into a more formidable opponent against  Microsoft Corp. , which has been pushing its Teams software suite—which includes Slack-like functions—as a new operating system for companies.</td>

      <td>Dollar General and Dollar Tree see a bright future in the treasure-hunt shopping experience</td>
      <td>Earlier this year, consumable goods like food were what was driving sales growth at dollar stores. Now these discount retailers are raising their sights to higher-margin items such as party goods and home accessories.<br />Take  Dollar General ,  which said Thursday that net sales rose 17% and net income expanded 57% in the quarter ended Oct. 30 from a year earlier. Home products sold particularly well. That has helped boost Dollar General’s gross margins, which have been expanding for six consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. On an earnings call, Chief Executive Todd Vasos said it was the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in non-consumables sales.<br />The greater profitability of these items makes for a strong draw. Rival  Dollar Tree  has two brands, its namesake brand, which sells discretionary items for a dollar each, and Family Dollar, which is more like Dollar General in selling a mix of goods at value prices. The former’s gross margins came in at 34.9% in its latest quarter, while the latter’s were 26.8%. Dollar General’s gross margin is somewhere in between, at 31.3%.<br />Dollar General had already started introducing more discretionary goods through an initiative it started last year to add more assortment. It is really leaning in now with a new store concept, Popshelf, carrying discretionary items under $5. The discounter is betting that the treasure-hunt experience will appeal to a suburban audience of higher-income customers. It has opened two new stores near Nashville, which have performed better than the company’s expectations. Dollar General plans to have 30 Popshelf stores by the end of 2021.<br />Dollar Tree, too, said in its most recent earnings call that it will roll out 500 higher-priced stores—with goods priced between a dollar and $5—beginning next spring.</td>

David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in the Jan. 5 runoffs, which will determine control of the Senate. Mr. Perdue is facing Democrat Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, and Ms. Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock, a pastor.<br />White House officials and Trump campaign aides say they know the president could go off script to criticize GOP Gov. Brian Kemp and other Republican officials—as he has repeatedly—at Saturday’s rally in Valdosta. They know he could fixate on his complaints that the election was rigged, even though Georgia has certified President-elect Joe Biden as the winner of the state’s 16 electoral votes. No evidence of widespread voter fraud, in Georgia or elsewhere, has emerged.<br />But they remain hopeful that Mr. Trump will deliver the agreed-upon message: Republicans must vote, so they can keep both senators in office and ensure a Republican Senate majority that can protect the president’s accomplishments.<br />“I’m not sure what he’s going to say,” one Trump adviser said. “He’s super pissed.”</td>

On Thursday, European low-cost leader  Ryanair  confirmed that it would exercise the option to buy a further 75 units, on top of 135 previously ordered.<br />Shares in the Chicago-based plane maker, which has estimated the cost of the MAX debacle at around $20 billion, rose almost 8%. To meet scheduled production rates, the company needs to ship out the 450 MAX planes it has in storage, about 100 of which no longer have a prospective buyer and need to be remarketed.<br />Yet it shouldn’t be a surprise that the plane is selling again.<br />Because aircraft aren’t consumer products, even the biggest scandals are unlikely to push a model out of the market. The infamous McDonnell Douglas DC-10 carried passengers for decades after being grounded. Airlines facing any customer backlash could probably get away with subtle rebranding in fuselages and onboard safety cards. Ryanair labels its custom high-capacity MAX the “737-8200.”</td>

We know where we agree. We can do this.”<br />Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. McConnell spoke on Thursday afternoon, according to Mrs. Pelosi’s office.

I oversee the intelligence agencies, and my office produces the President’s Daily Brief detailing the threats facing the country. If I could communicate one thing to the American people from this unique vantage point, it is that the People’s Republic of China poses the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War II.<br />The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the U.S. and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically. Many of China’s major public initiatives and prominent companies offer only a layer of camouflage to the activities of the Chinese Communist Party.<br />I call its approach of economic espionage “rob, replicate and replace.” China robs U.S. companies of their intellectual property, replicates the technology, and then replaces the U.S. firms in the global marketplace.<br />Take Sinovel.

The theft resulted in the U.S. company losing more than $1 billion in shareholder value and cutting 700 jobs. Today Sinovel sells wind turbines world-wide as if it built a legitimate business through ingenuity and hard work rather than theft.<br />The FBI frequently arrests Chinese nationals for stealing research-and-development secrets. Until the head of Harvard’s Chemistry Department was arrested earlier this year, China was allegedly paying him $50,000 a month as part of a plan to attract top scientists and reward them for stealing information. The professor has pleaded not guilty to making false statements to U.S. authorities. Three scientists were ousted in 2019 from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston over concerns about China’s theft of cancer research. The U.S. government estimates that China’s intellectual-property theft costs America as much as $500 billion a year, or between $4,000 and $6,000 per U.S. household.</td>

      <td>How does an unstable nucleus ‘know’ when it’s time to decay? The answer may lie in the fabric of space itself.</td>
      <td>Nobel Prize-winning physicist Frank Wilczek explores the secrets of the cosmos. Read previous columns here.<br />In 1935, the physicist Erwin Schrödinger invented a thought-experiment to test whether quantum theory fully describes reality. Known as “Schrödinger’s Cat,” the experiment asks us to imagine a cat in a sealed box, together with a vial containing poisonous gas and a mechanism that can shatter the vial. The mechanism is triggered when an unstable atomic nucleus decays, breaking the glass and killing the cat.<br />According to quantum theory, however, the nucleus can be in different states, unchanged or decayed, at the same time. Only when it is observed do the possible states “collapse,” making it definite whether the nucleus has decayed or not. Thus the poor cat somehow hovers between life and death, waiting for somebody or something to collapse the nucleus’s state (and thus its own). This weird situation suggested to Schrödinger that quantum theory is missing something. With all respect to him, however, I think that the weird part of the setup isn’t the cat; it’s the behavior of the unstable nucleus.<br />To see why, consider radioactive dating, a marvelous technique for determining the age of objects. It is used in archaeology, to date human artifacts; in geology, to date stones and strata; and in astrophysics, to date distant stars and gas clouds. The accuracy of radioactive dating is undisputed, yet the principle behind it is deeply strange.<br />Many objects contain some nuclei that are unstable, meaning that they will eventually decay, changing into a different isotope and emitting energy in the process. In every equal interval of time, a fixed proportion of the unstable nuclei in a sample will decay. The amount of time it takes for half of them to decay is known as the isotope’s half-life.</td>

      <td>Legislation differs from House version, leaving prospects of new law unclear</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Senate unanimously passed a bill late Wednesday aimed at clearing a backlog of green cards for primarily Indian immigrants, after more than a year of wrangling following House passage of a similar bill in 2019.<br />The bill lifts caps on the number of permanent-residency permits, commonly known as green cards, awarded to immigrants from any one country who come to the U.S. with job offers. That would allow people who have waited in the backlog the longest—primarily Indian immigrants on H-1B high-skill visas—to receive green cards first under a revamped system.<br />The bill was approved under a procedure known as unanimous consent, which allows legislation with no opposition to pass without moving through the normal process of roll-call votes and hearings. Considerable differences exist between the Senate and House bills, and the short window for consolidating them in the current session of Congress clouds the prospect of a law taking effect soon.<br />Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), the bill’s sponsor, has attempted to bring up the country-caps bill on four previous occasions in the last year-and-a-half, though each time a different senator objected, forcing Mr. Lee to alter the bill to meet specific demands. As a result, the bill that passed contains a small carve-out intended for nurses from the Philippines—a key demand from hospital groups backed by Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.)—and provisions imposing restrictions on companies that employ half their workers on H-1B visas.<br />The most recent objection came from Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.), who inserted two measures backed by the White House. The first would impose a new cap of sorts for the next decade on the overall number of immigrants on H-1B visas who can receive green cards. The second could severely restrict future immigration from China.</td>

The agency said the meat can be sold in Singapore as an ingredient in Eat Just’s nuggets product.<br />Eat Just said the approval followed two years of discussion and review. It opens the way for the first commercial sales of such cell-cultured meat, which uses self-replicating animal cells to grow muscle tissue that can be harvested as meat.<br />Developers have said the technology still is in its infancy, and producing meat in bioreactor tanks from animal cells remains far more expensive than raising and slaughtering chickens, cattle and hogs. The technology has drawn investments from major meatpackers like Cargill Inc. and  Tyson Foods Inc.,  as well as such investors as Bill Gates and Richard Branson.<br />Proponents say the method can ease the environmental impact of producing meat for a growing world population, though farmers and ranchers have been skeptical of consumers’ appetite for hamburgers and chicken breasts developed in laboratories.</td>

After her family Thanksgiving was canceled, Ms. Finnegan, 37, a chief customer-experience officer for RiteAid in Los Angeles, will spend the holiday with her parents on Long Island after quarantining. “I see us making a bigger deal out of it than usual,” she said. “Everything’s riding on those two days—you want to make it more fun.” Same goes for her holiday wardrobe. “I’m excited to get something new and to feel special.” She’s open to both tartan and glitter.<br />With Covid cases spiking, the holidays barely resemble themselves—goodbye family trips and awkward office parties, hello outdoor dinners and equally awkward Zooms. What does that mean for jolly dressing? Some women, like Ms. Finnegan, are compensating for months spent in athleisure by decking themselves out. Others, like 33-year-old Julie Webman, are forgoing the fuss. “I’m not dressing up. Comfort is leading my decision-making process,” said Ms. Webman, an activewear merchant in New York. For Hanukkah video calls, she’ll rely on cashmere joggers, a sweater and minor concessions to merriment. “I’m going to put on hoops and blow-dry my hair. But I’m not putting on shoes.”<br />Caroline Maguire, fashion director of e-commerce site Shopbop, advises Zoomers to elevate an at-home look with an idiosyncratic sweater—like the knit at right. “We can’t keep them in stock,” she said of the site’s intarsia and Fair Isle options. If that feels like a generic gesture toward cheer, she suggests layers of necklaces.<br />Celebrating outdoors? “I would do a bright-colored puffer jacket,” said Ikram Goldman, co-founder of Chicago boutique Ikram. “And there’s no question that you should be in a funny hat.” While we do have a few questions (just how funny?), we’ll concede that quirky accessories help fuel dinner chat. For defiantly festive cocooning, Ms. Goldman specifies “dresses with a lot of detail,” like the knot-embellished satin Rabih Kayrouz style she’s planning to wear indoors. Another contender: the bowed Khaite number at right.<br />While spending Christmas Eve at home with her husband and twin boys, Chicago’s Eboni S. Gates plans to wear decadent black silk pajama bottoms and a blouse. “I want to be relaxed, happy, cozy and luxurious,” said the 46-year-old head of VIP relations at Expo Chicago. “It’s been an emotionally tense year. I feel like I need to pamper myself a little bit. I think we all do.”</td>

      <td>The company is pushing back against claims it isn’t doing enough to protect its users</td>
      <td>Facebook Inc.  updated its misinformation policy around the coronavirus crisis to include vaccine-related content, as the company looks to continue its fight against claims that it isn’t doing enough to protect its billions of users.<br />The social-networking giant said Thursday that over the coming weeks it would start removing false claims and conspiracy theories about Covid-19 vaccines that have been debunked by public health experts on Facebook and Instagram.<br />“This is another way that we are applying our policy to remove misinformation about the virus that could lead to imminent physical harm,” Facebook said in a blog post, adding that the effort will take time to implement and may change based on guidance from public-health authorities.<br />The company said the policy update reflects anticipation of vaccines becoming available soon. Earlier this week the U.K. became the first Western nation to grant emergency-use authorization for a Covid-19 vaccine. A shot developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and Germany’s  BioNTech SE  could be distributed in limited quantities imminently.<br />Facebook has come under fire in recent years by government agencies, politicians and others for its handling of the spread of misinformation. With additional Covid-19 vaccines expected to gain approval from regulators world-wide, the company is sharpening its focus on public health-related misinformation. Health experts say inoculations are critical to help end the pandemic, yet surveys show many people are hesitant or opposed to getting vaccinated.</td>

Ryanair chose to exercise the option it had to buy additional aircraft on top of 135 it had previously agreed to buy from Boeing.<br />The Ryanair deal is a reprieve for the struggling Chicago-based aerospace giant, which has lost hundreds of MAX orders amid a nearly two-year grounding following two fatal crashes of the jet——and is now struggling amid a pandemic that has sapped demand for air travel. The U.S. last month approved the MAX for passenger flights again, issuing a set of safety directives and notices to airlines globally.<br />Michael O’Leary, the airline’s chief executive, said it would accelerate its delivery schedule for the jets, saying the order would help the airline’s growth as travel demand returns. “We’re proud to buy them. We’re proud to fly them,” he said.<br />As of last month, airlines and aircraft-leasing firms had canceled about 10% of Boeing’s outstanding MAX orders this year. Boeing has said it believes hundreds more of its remaining more than 4,000 orders could be in jeopardy because of the financial health of some customers.</td>

These products aren’t meant for consumers. Rather, they are designed for the merchants and vendors that do business with Stripe’s customers.<br />Among the early adopters of Stripe’s new banking services is  Shopify Inc.,  which, starting early next year, will offer Shopify Balance accounts to many of the hundreds of thousands of merchants that use its software. Shopify Balance accounts will be held at Memphis, Tenn.-based Evolve Bancorp Inc., but Stripe is also partnering with Goldman in the U.S. and with Citigroup and  Barclays  PLC internationally to store and move customer funds.<br />Digital banks like  Square Inc.’s  Cash App and startup Chime Financial Inc. have recently earned big followings—and multibillion-dollar valuations—by providing consumers with alternatives to checking accounts. Stripe, on the other hand, is focused on automating business banking, specifically for platforms that themselves have existing ties to scores of other businesses.<br />A number of financial-technology companies offer banking and lending services alongside their signature products. Square, for example, offers commercial loans to users based in part on signals about creditworthiness gleaned from processing payments, a business that Stripe also entered last year.</td>

Across the country, dry-ice makers are planning to boost production of the frigid storage material needed to ship hundreds of millions of doses to hospitals, pharmacies and physicians’ offices.<br />Brad Dunn, vice president of Cee Kay Supply Inc., which makes dry ice at three Missouri plants, said he has fielded calls from public-health departments, medical-supply and logistics companies planning to take part in what  Pfizer Inc.  has called its biggest vaccination campaign ever.<br />Pfizer is expected to have the first Covid-19 vaccine cleared by U.S. regulators, kicking off a mass vaccination drive that will eventually include other shots. The drugmaker expects to distribute 25 million doses in the U.S. this year and another 1.3 billion globally in 2021.<br />Few pharmaceutical products have required such low temperatures for storage and transit. Pfizer’s vaccine must be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius to remain stable and effective. The temperature of dry ice is around minus 78 degrees Celsius. A vaccine  Moderna Inc.  is developming must also be stored at cold temperatures, though not as low as those Pfizer’s shot requires.

      <td>A recent Vogue photoshoot showing the singer in a full-length frock nearly broke the internet—underscoring the almost unprecedented influence he has over young men’s fashion decisions</td>
      <td>HARRY STYLES wore a dress. You may well know that already even if you don’t follow fashion or music closely. Photos of the British singer in the custom Gucci frock—snapped for the cover of Vogue—swarmed the internet a few weeks ago, sending his brigade of fans into a tizzy. Scads of tweets and online articles recycled the images. And while most of the coverage lauded Mr. Styles for his beguiling, gender-bending outfit, some conservative pundits including Candace Owens predictably wrung their hands, interpreting the hubbub as a death knell for the so-called “manly man.” The cover itself was a landmark: Mr. Styles is the first man to grace the cover of Vogue solo. Think of the instantly collectible issue as a coronation of sorts, confirming that the 26-year-old singer is now officially style-royalty.<br />Mr. Styles, who rose to fame as a member of the boy band One Direction before going solo, has been a fashion provocateur for several years now. A muse to Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele, he consistently wears the label’s rather unisex wares such as tapestry print trousers, lithe loafers and pussy-bow blouses. (Representatives for the artist did not respond to a request for comment for this story and, through a representative, his stylist Harry Lambert declined to comment.)<br />On Instagram, feverish fan accounts like @Hsfashionarchive (which has over 100,000 followers) vie to identify whatever Mr. Styles is photographed wearing, from whimsically wide floral pants by British designer Steven Stokey Daley to a candy-colored necklace by New York jewelers Eliou. This year Mr. Styles topped the “Power Dressers” list on Lyst, a fashion-focused search platform, reflecting the strong correlation between his clothing choices and what online shoppers seek. Camilla Clarkson, communications director at Lyst, noted that Mr. Styles’s “non-binary style” helps drive his popularity, particularly with a younger generation that liberally shops across gender lines.<br />Some older observers, however, regard Mr. Styles’s fashion choices through a “been there, seen that” lens. “It’s kind of like this year’s version of rock-star packaging or something,” said Vincent Boucher, 67, a lecturer at Parsons School of Design in New York. As precursors, Mr. Boucher pointed to Kurt Cobain, Mick Jagger and David Bowie, all of whom donned dresses decades ago, nimbly crossing gender lines. (I’d add to that list the lesser-known, openly gay disco singer Sylvester, who frequently vacillated between men’s and women’s clothing—see the video for his 1978 number-one hit, “You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real).”)<br />Mr. Styles’s Vogue cover elicited little more than “a shrug” from Andrew Groves, 52, a fashion professor at Westminster University in London. As Prof. Groves pointed out, when Bowie wore a dress in the early ‘70s, it was “really provocative because it was outside society’s norms.”</td>

Increased volatility before and after the election fueled much of the surge, along with growing adoption of electronic trading, the company said.<br />“The vast majority of folks inside Tradeweb and at our clients are working remotely, and that change in environment provided an opportunity for firms like us,” said Lee Olesky, Tradeweb’s chief executive. “You don’t have anyone sitting next to you, and you don’t have as many screens and data sources. Having a good digital source of information and ability to execute is key.”<br />The boom in electronic bond trading comes amid a wave of growth and consolidation among providers of financial data and services.  S&P Global Inc.  announced on Monday a planned purchase of  IHS Markit Ltd. , a deal valued at $44 billion that would form one of the largest financial data providers in the world. Tradeweb’s share price has risen about 27% this year, according to FactSet.<br />Competitor  MarketAxess Holdings Inc.  reported on Wednesday a 37% increase in credit trading in November.

They might worry more about 2022.<br />Even as Western nations struggle to contain another jump in Covid-19 infections, most S&P 500 sectors are now up year-to-date. Yet equities didn’t get much of a boost Wednesday when the U.K. approved for use the vaccine made by  Pfizer  and  BioNTech .  The power of good news about the pandemic seems to be subject to diminishing returns, raising the question: Is the profit rebound mostly priced in?<br />Wall Street is factoring in a 22% increase in S&P 500 earnings per share for next year. This seems reasonable, even cautious, following the expected 15% fall this year. This summer showed that consumption can return very quickly when restrictions are eased, and global trade and manufacturing already seem to be on a steady path to recovery. In 2010, after the global financial crash, profit growth was 40% as a result of a dismal 2009.<br />But forecasts for 2022, the first “normal” year after the crisis, say more about what the market is thinking. Those expectations look less grounded.<br />As of now, S&P 500 earnings per share are seen expanding another 17% in 2022. This is in line with what happened in 2011, when they rose 15%. Back then, however, profits were far less elevated because the downturn had lasted longer: Relative to their 2007 peak, they were up only 11% in 2011. Current expectations of 2022 earnings place them 21% above 2019 levels. Consumer-cyclical companies such as auto makers and hotels would be up 35% overall.</td>

Our guest this week, a 2020 Land Rover Defender 110 P400 SE, is about six months late to my party due to delays in production, trans-ocean logistics and overland delivery. The new Defender can climb a wall but it can’t get over Covid-19.<br />Four-door 110 models are now arriving at U.S. dealerships, but production of the two-door 90 models at Nitra, Slovakia, has been set back. Making matters worse: The 90, on a shortened wheelbase, is the cutest damn thing you ever did see—funky fresh and coltish, the SUV preferred by Serengeti game wardens who are also boy-band heartthrobs.<br />The new Defender is a triumph of industrial design, a big, beautiful box of postcolonial nostalgia, if not amnesia, evoking the primitive overlanders of empire while being nothing like them internally. It is to the old what  BMW ’s  New Mini (circa 2000) was to Sir Alec Issigonis’ postwar tobacco tin. Defender’s heritage cues—the blocky volumes, the upright windshield, chamfered horizontal shoulder lines, shoebox greenhouse, white-capped roof with alpine windows—have all been redrafted here in a kind of eight-bit, Minecraft modernity.<br />The anatomy is familiar. Defender shares engines and drivetrain components with the Discovery and other Jaguar Land Rover products; the chassis comprises heavy-duty versions of JLR’s long-travel multi-link suspension, adaptive dampers, and ride-height adjustable pneumatic springs. Defender does get its own, new and prodigious platform, a bonded aluminum monocoque that feels like it could shake off a land mine.<br />It’s easier to list what’s lovable about the Defender—hose-able floors, sharkskin-like cabin trim, optional frontbench seating—than to explain why, exactly, anyone would buy one, especially in the first year. I’d be terrified. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) products have some of the worst reliability scores in the industry; and some Defenders already in-country have manifested serious problems.</td>

Among the biggest beneficiaries: Canadian banks, which have avoided major loan losses and boosted deposits.<br />The biggest Canadian banks,  Royal Bank of Canada  and TD Bank Group, reported earnings growth during their fiscal fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, boosted by lower provisions for loan losses.<br />Canada’s federal and provincial governments spent 382 billion Canadian dollars on virus-related relief this year, equal to almost $300 billion, and accounting for roughly one-fifth of Canada’s total economic output in the third quarter. The money included funding for income and wage supports for people who lost jobs or worked fewer hours during the pandemic, zero-interest-rate loans for small businesses, and loan guarantees.<br />Bolstered by those supports, Canadians have continued making loan and credit-card payments they may have otherwise missed. The relief has been coupled with bank-led deferral programs that let homeowners delay mortgage payments, and the net effect has allowed banks to avoid writing off big chunks of their lending books.<br />TD Bank, which owns the 10th-largest bank in the U.S. by assets, reported on Thursday it provisioned C$149 million less in its Canadian retail unit during the fourth quarter than it had a year ago, and attributed the decline to bank and government assistance programs.</td>

      <td>Marc Agronin is a geriatric psychiatrist at Miami Jewish Health and the author of “The End of Old Age: Living a Longer, More Purposeful Life”<br />Stay-at-home orders and continuing social distancing have increased virtual communication among many extended families during the coronavirus pandemic. Most notably, some older adults who once viewed themselves as technological Luddites have learned to log into Zoom chats as frequently as the average teenager on Instagram or TikTok.<br />And with the coronavirus pandemic on track to get much worse before it gets better, all this Zooming is likely to continue for a while. So how can an older person get the most out of these virtual connections with family, friends and health-care professionals?<br /><br />First, we should acknowledge that for many seniors, video calls and meetings on Zoom and other platforms typically have a small sensory field, limited by the size of the screen being used, the volume of the speakers and the integrity of the connection. As a result, it can be a struggle for someone with vision or hearing loss. Some people try to compensate by getting closer to the screen. Poor internet connections exacerbate sensory deficits, leading to frustration and sometimes a premature end to the call.</td>

During his time as president, from 1974 to 1981, France lowered its voting age to 18, allowed divorce by mutual consent and legalized abortion, a fight spearheaded by his health minister, Simone Veil.<br />“The directions he set for France still guide our steps,” said French President Emmanuel Macron in an overnight communiqué, ahead of a televised speech planned for Thursday evening, in which he described his predecessor as a “servant of the state, politician of progress and freedom” whose his death is a cause of “mourning for the French nation.”<br />Mr. Giscard d’Estaing embodied of a style of politics that would later shape the thinking of centrist leaders such as Mr. Macron. He worked across borders to develop multilateral institutions that would allow Western allies to coordinate in fighting global crises and cooperate in setting economic and foreign policy. He deepened France’s alliance with Germany; was an architect of the European Monetary Union that paved the way for the euro; and shepherded annual summits of wealthy nations that eventually grew into the Group of Seven.</td>

      <td>New applications for unemployment benefits fell last week after a recent jump, an indication that the labor market recovery is navigating through new virus-related restrictions in some states.<br />Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits, a proxy for layoffs, fell by 75,000 to a seasonally adjusted 712,000 in the week ended Nov. 28, the Labor Department said Thursday. That follows two consecutive increases and comes amid evidence that the economy continues to recover from the spring’s shutdowns, but at a slower pace. The previous week’s level was higher than any recorded before this year, but well down from a peak of nearly 7 million in late March.<br />The weekly claims data, which policy makers and investors have relied on throughout the pandemic for timely information about the labor market, came under scrutiny this week after a government watchdog said the data were flawed. The Government Accountability Office said in a report that states have provided inconsistent data to the Labor Department and incidents of fraud have distorted the numbers.<br />The Labor Department agreed to clarify how jobless claims are counted in the weekly jobless-claims report, but an agency spokeswoman said the department didn’t anticipate any changes in methodology.<br />Other recent data, from the Commerce Department, suggest the economic recovery from the spring’s shutdowns has continued. Consumer spending and retail sales both rose in October, though at a slower pace compared with prior months. Sales of newly built homes in October remained near their highest level in more than a decade.</td>

Nasdaq-100 futures edged 0.2% higher, pointing to a muted advance in tech stocks after the opening bell.<br />Trading has been choppy this week as November’s explosive rally in global stocks lost steam. The S&P 500 has repeatedly eked out fresh records on the back of investors’ optimism that Covid-19 vaccines will accelerate the economic rebound next year. But rich valuations for stocks and elevated infection levels are tempering some of that cheer, leading to a more subdued move upward in recent days.<br />“Markets have been driving higher, seeing 2021 as the year economies will snap back,” said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank. “There is concern a lot of the good news is already priced in, so I don’t expect markets to go shooting into the stratosphere any time soon, but we could see a general grind higher.”<br />Ahead of the market open, Tesla gained over 4%. A Goldman Sachs analyst upgraded the stock’s rating to buy and raised the price target. Tesla will be added to the S&P 500 later this month, which would prompt passive funds that track the index to add the stock to their portfolios.</td>

It previously said it would spend $19 billion to $22 billion a year through 2024 before the pandemic, while returning as much as $80 billion to shareholders over that period.<br />The reductions by the U.S. oil giant follow those announced this week by rival  Exxon Mobil Corp. , which on Monday said it was reducing its yearly capital spending by about $5 billion to $10 billion each year through 2025. Exxon, which has lost more than $2.3 billion over the first three quarters of this year, also said it would slash the book value of its assets by up to $20 billion.<br />Chevron has lost nearly $5 billion this year, but unlike Exxon has managed to avoid taking on large amounts of new debt due to a relatively strong balance sheet. The company’s share price is down about 5% over the last six months and closed at $89.87 Wednesday.<br />“Chevron remains committed to capital discipline with a 2021 capital budget and longer-term capital outlook that are well below our prior guidance,” Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth said.</td>

Developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ,  rollout could start next week. Regulators in the U.S. and other countries are now evaluating the new two-shot vaccine and other candidates before authorizing them for distribution. Over 3,000 people were reported to have died from Covid-19 in the U.S. on Wednesday, the highest figure since the pandemic began. Pfizer has already begun shipping shots to distribution sites in anticipation of gaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration, which is planning to review the vaccine on Dec. 10 and could authorize its use soon after.<br />However, criminals would face the same logistical challenges as the drug companies in shipping and storing the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and another candidate produced by  Moderna Inc.</td>

Officials organized test runs to refine the logistics of delivering a shot that, in the case of the vaccine developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ,  has to be stored at an ultralow temperature. The government changed the law to allow student doctors, physiotherapists and dental workers to administer the jab. Scientists advising the government have drawn up a provisional list of who should get vaccinated first.<br />The scale and urgency of the task is such that the NHS, already under enormous pressure because of the pandemic, has appealed for retired doctors and nurses to rejoin the service and for thousands of volunteers to train as vaccinators and support staff.<br />The project will be “the biggest vaccination campaign in our history,” NHS Chief Executive Simon Stevens said Wednesday.<br />One major help: Vaccine skepticism is lower in the U.K. than in many other Western countries. A survey by Ipsos in October showed 79% of Britons would get Covid-19 shots if available, compared with 64% in the U.S. and 54% in France.</td>

Creative Director Alessandro Michele—hailed as a visionary for eclectic, pop-culture infused designs that ignited up social media and attracted millennials and Gen Z—is shifting to more subtle designs that play on the brand’s decades of heritage.<br />“They are going after the largest, yet most neglected, segment of luxury buyers—baby boomers,” said Pauline Brown, professor at Columbia Business School and former head of the North American division of LVMH Moët Hennessy  Louis Vuitton  SE, one of Gucci’s major rivals.<br />“Older consumers not only have the means to buy their products, but they’re living longer, healthier, more fashionable lives,” she said.<br />Executives at Gucci and its parent,  Kering SA,  say they are counting on the new aesthetic to broaden the label’s client base and drive growth, following a four-year run from 2015 when revenue more than doubled. That plan has grown more urgent since the pandemic, as revenue plunged and flocks of tourists from abroad—avid Gucci customers—stayed at home. When a second wave of lockdowns swept the West, brands across the luxury sector scrambled to replace the tourist revenue.</td>

A United cardholder for roughly 15 years, Ms. Moore traveled often. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit and Ms. Moore, 53 years old, scaled back her spending and canceled travel plans.<br />Ms. Moore, a senior director at a national health care organization in Washington, D.C., decided to keep the card after JPMorgan offered her a $200 statement credit. But she has barely used the card since, and is instead mostly using debit cards.<br />Nearly nine months into the pandemic, banks and airlines are scrambling to rescue their airline rewards cards.

The result is that while Europe’s largest economies are likely to contract in the final quarter of the year, the recovery in Asia’s largest economies is set to continue.<br />Data firm  IHS Markit  Thursday said its Purchasing Managers Index for the eurozone’s services sector fell to 41.7 in November from 46.9 in October, its lowest level since May.

Prosecutors said the national-security investigation is continuing and opposed bail for the 73-year-old, according to local media. Magistrate Victor So Wai-tak declined bail while setting the next court appearance for April 16, meaning Mr. Lai will be held for 4½ months in prison.

Fellow activists Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam were also given prison sentences.<br />The indictment against Mr. Lai and Next Digital senior executives Chow Tat-kuen and Wong Wai-keung alleges that a property leased by an Apple Daily-affiliated company from a Hong Kong government entity hadn’t been used as intended, and the trio were in breach of the lease.

On Black Friday, electronics stores saw almost four times as much revenue from online credit-card purchases as they did in 2019.<br />Other data trackers say U.S. shoppers are spending less than last year.

So what happens when mask sales, which are already on the decline, go away? Early holiday sales data are encouraging, suggesting Etsy could continue to climb, buoyed by more-sustainable categories and a defensible business model.<br />In its third-quarter report, Etsy said masks’ percentage of gross merchandise sales had dropped to 11%. It cited a steady monthly deceleration, expecting mask sales to be substantially lower in the fourth quarter compared with a quarter earlier.<br />Still, data from Edison Trends show that Etsy expanded online customer spending on Cyber Monday by 73% year-over-year—well ahead of top retailers such as  Target  and  Amazon ,  at 43% and 19%, respectively.<br />Since it is unlikely that masks were a big holiday gift draw, Etsy’s recent growth seems to imply broad interest in nonmask products that can continue after the coronavirus pandemic subsides. Etsy says that “personalized gift” has actually been the most-searched term on its site this year and that top sellers throughout its recent cyber week sale included such things as custom ornaments and blankets.</td>

Investors have voted with their wallets: BioNTech’s New York-traded shares have rallied more than 30% over the past month, while Moderna’s stock has more than doubled over that same period.<br />That reaction makes some sense: After all, initial doses will be sold directly to governments at fixed prices, which means that huge profits are likely next year. And the success of the vaccine programs bodes well for other treatments the companies are developing that rely on similar technology.<br />Still, investors expecting that these two companies will dominate this huge market indefinitely are getting ahead of themselves. Key questions about the long-run value of each vaccine program are yet to be resolved.</td>

      <td>A season poised for disaster instead has Spurs at top of the league ahead of the North London Derby against rival Arsenal</td>
      <td>Early in his tenure as manager of Tottenham Hotspur, José Mourinho sat down the most lethal English striker of his generation to tell him he wasn’t famous enough. The problem, he lectured Harry Kane, was that people didn’t believe the sport’s truly elite players belonged at a club like Spurs, in a league like England’s.<br />“They still think that movie stars of football belong to other places,” Mourinho told him in 2019, while being filmed by  Amazon ’s  “All or Nothing” documentary crew. “We have to build your status in that direction.”<br />Luckily, Mourinho added, he could help. Mourinho was already a soccer movie star.<br />José Mourinho has been playing the role of José Mourinho for so long now that it’s hard to tell where the veteran soccer manager ends and the rule-breaking, smirking caricature begins. Especially when Mourinho does things like hold an illegal workout in a London park during Britain’s spring lockdown. Or lose a bet to one of his players and shell out $650 for an Iberian ham.<br />The act can be grating to fans of any club that he isn’t currently coaching. But Mourinho is reminding them why he gets away with it nearly two decades after he first shook up European soccer. Underneath the caricature, there remains a serial winner. Ten games into the season, he has Tottenham at the top of the Premier League and mounting a genuine title challenge.</td>

It couldn’t be determined when the court would resume hearing the case.<br />Despite the uncertainty over how the case would unfold, the crowd appeared energized as 27-year-old Zhou Xiaoxuan emerged from the court, according to video clips circulating online and people on the scene. After roughly 11 hours of proceedings had concluded, she said she would continue to fight her case.

He has denied the claims, filing a defamation lawsuit against Ms. Zhou and Xu Chao, a woman who shared her account with a wider online audience on China’s  Twitter -like social-messaging site Weibo.

There have been concerns raised about the speed with which Covid-19 vaccines have been developed,” Dr. Hahn said. “This will meet our gold standard of safety and efficacy that the American people have come to trust.”<br />Dr. Hahn’s comments came on the day that British regulators cleared the Pfizer vaccine for general distribution.

Their stated grounds is that Ms. Shelton is a threat to Fed independence. That argument is worth addressing, especially as the Biden Administration prepares to take power.<br />“I oppose the nomination of Judy Shelton because I am not convinced that she supports the independence of the Federal Reserve Board as much as I believe the Board of Governors should,” Sen. Lamar Alexander said in a recent statement. “I don’t want to turn over management of the money supply to a Congress and a President who can’t balance the federal budget.”<br />Mr. Alexander is retiring at the end of this Congress and on Wednesday he gave a wise and entertaining farewell address (see nearby). But on Ms. Shelton and Fed independence, we’re sorry to say he has it backward. The Fed needs Ms. Shelton’s voice because the Fed is already sacrificing its independence.<br />Take Mr. Alexander’s point about Congress and the President failing to balance the budget. True enough. But the Fed has willingly become the chief enabler of that failure. By keeping interest rates near zero for most of the last 11 years, and buying Treasury bonds and mortgage securities in the trillions of dollars seemingly without end, the Fed is reducing the cost of financing federal debt.<br />This policy has sometimes been warranted—notably in the financial panic and recession of 2008-2009 and again amid the pandemic. But is it always warranted—and for as far into the future as the Fed can see? That’s close to the view of current Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed governors who have said they won’t change monetary policy until 2023.</td>

It concluded that census officials have identified at least 15 anomalies in the data that affect more than one million census records. It said the bureau needs until Feb. 3 to transmit data the president called for in a memorandum requesting that unauthorized immigrants be excluded from the count.<br />State population totals are required by law to be delivered to the president by Dec. 31. He must deliver them to the newly elected House within a week of its opening, which normally occurs Jan. 3.<br />Signs that the timeline would slip emerged last month. Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham said in mid-November that anomalies had been discovered in processing. If Mr. Trump can’t relay the figures before he leaves office Jan. 20, President-elect Joe Biden would handle it.</td>

      <td>The more we think about the new racial, gender and LGBTQ mandates for corporate directors that Nasdaq announced on Tuesday, the more absurd they seem.<br />How is a company supposed to find out if a board candidate is gay if that isn’t already known? Is it supposed to hire private detectives to look into it? Once that person joins the board, does the company then have to broadcast his or her sexual orientation in the annual report so progressives can be satisfied that the quota is met? We could go on.<br />For a dose of sanity, we thought readers might enjoy Warren Buffett’s views on what he looks for in a director. The following is from the legendary investor’s 2006 letter to shareholders in  Berkshire Hathaway ’s  annual report:<br />“In selecting a new director, we were guided by our long-standing criteria, which are that board members be owner-oriented, business-savvy, interested and truly independent. . . .<br />“Charlie [Munger, Berkshire vice chairman] and I believe our four criteria are essential if directors are to do their job—which, by law, is to faithfully represent owners. Yet these criteria are usually ignored. Instead, consultants and CEOs seeking board candidates will often say, ‘We’re looking for a woman,’ or ‘a Hispanic,’ or ‘someone from abroad,’ or what have you. It sometimes sounds as if the mission is to stock Noah’s ark. Over the years I’ve been queried many times about potential directors and have yet to hear anyone ask, ‘Does he think like an intelligent owner?’</td>

So when Hong Kong police picked him up Wednesday on dubious fraud charges, China was sending a clear message: If you oppose us anywhere in the world, we will crush you.<br />In Mr. Lai’s case the decision to arrest him over the terms of a business lease sends the additional message that any charges will do. Though the fraud charge is not as serious as some of the others he already faces, especially on national security, its purpose is to dirty him up before he goes to trial on the others.<br />It’s no coincidence he was detained the same day three other pro-democracy champions—Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam—pleaded guilty and were sentenced to prison for participating in 2019 protests against a proposed extradition law. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rightly denounced the sentences as “appalling.”<br />We trust Joe Biden is paying attention. No doubt he’s not eager to start trouble with China. But Chinese leader Xi Jinping has his own priorities. He is testing whether a Biden Administration—especially one seeking a climate accord—will look the other way on China’s behavior in Hong Kong and elsewhere.<br />The Trump Administration, in particular Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has spoken up for Mr. Lai. The Administration has also sanctioned Chinese and Hong Kong officials for “undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy and restricting the freedom of expression or assembly of the citizens of Hong Kong.”</td>

      <td>Thanks to the underlying strength of the Trump economy on the eve of this pandemic, America’s economic recovery to date has exceeded even the most optimistic forecasts. With several mass-produced vaccines now in sight, it is essential that Congress provide a timely, targeted and temporary fiscal bridge to ensure that American households and firms have the support they need to keep the recovery on pace.<br />This year the U.S. economy was hit by the worst macroeconomic shock in almost a century. Real gross domestic product in the second quarter fell 31.4% at an annual rate. Unemployment jumped to 14.7% between February and April as more than 20 million Americans lost jobs.<br />Thanks to unprecedented action by the Trump administration and Congress, the unemployment rate is now 6.9%. Real GDP growth is on pace to end the year down by about 2 percentage points. While substantial, that would be a smaller contraction than in 2008, and only one-fifth of the drop predicted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.<br />This robust recovery notwithstanding, the U.S. still faces significant headwinds from the pandemic, which has restructured transportation, entertainment, hotels, restaurants and commercial real estate. Adding to these structural woes is the prospect of renewed lockdowns across the 50 states.<br />Timely, targeted relief would do more than sustain the swift recovery of the labor market. It would also help realign federal receipts and outlays more quickly, as nothing blows a hole in long-run fiscal sustainability like a large, persistent output gap.</td>

      <td>Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.), who is retiring at the end of this term, speaking on the Senate floor Dec. 2:<br /><br />More than ever, our country needs a United States Senate to turn pluribus into unum, to lead the American struggle to forge unity from diversity. . . . Divided government offers an opportunity to share the responsibility—or the blame—for hard decisions, such as controlling the federal debt.<br />Now, some advocate another way to operate the Senate. End the filibuster, the Senate’s best-known tradition. Don’t worry about working across party lines. Pass everything with a majority vote.<br />Let the passions of the people roar through the Senate. If you’re a Democrat: Abolish right-to-work laws. Repeal limits on abortion. Pass restriction on guns.</td>

      <td>Sens. Perdue and Loeffler are the last line of defense for conservatives.</td>
      <td>America’s political attention is now focused not on Washington but Georgia, 700 miles south, where a Jan. 5 runoff election will decide that state’s two U.S. Senate seats—and with them, which party controls the upper chamber.<br />These runoffs are required by Georgia law because no Senate candidate received 50% of the vote in November. Since Republicans on Jan. 3 will have 50 Senate seats while Democrats will hold 48, the GOP can take control of the chamber by winning one of the seats. But it appears there will be little ticket splitting. Both seats are likely to go to the same party.<br />If Democrats win both, they will control the Senate, since Vice President Kamala Harris can break the 50-50 tie. If Republicans win both, they will keep the Senate and be in an excellent position to halt the Biden administration’s more extreme proposals.<br />What little polling there is suggests it will be close. Each party’s base is motivated, and while turnout will be down from November, it will still be large. Both sides will also have enough money. (As chairman of the Georgia Battleground Fund benefiting Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, I’m working to ensure Republicans do.)<br />Democrats have some advantages going into the runoff. In November their presidential candidate carried Georgia for the first time since 1992. Their defeated gubernatorial candidate from 2018, Stacey Abrams, has built a formidable get-out-the-vote operation. And the state’s demographic changes favor Democrats.</td>

      <td>I’ll take a fallen tree over water damage or a fire anytime.</td>
      <td>Lakewood, Ohio<br />An enormous oak fell onto one of the apartment buildings I own. There was no water damage or burst pipes at the building. That was the beautiful part. Also, nobody was hurt. Eighteen windows were knocked out, plus there was extensive roof and gutter damage. The building is a 1920s brick cube, most likely constructed by immigrant Italian masons. The building took the tree hit like Marciano.<br />My commercial property insurance has a $5,000 deductible. That’s unfortunately high. “Unfortunately” as in “Unfortunately, this was an act of God.” That’s what the insurance adjustor told me.<br />She also said the cleanup and repair were all on me, even though the tree had fallen from my neighbor’s property—a former funeral-home mansion turned office building. The owner of that building followed up: “Because of the gale force winds, this is labeled an Act of God. In Ohio that means the property the tree lands on is the property responsible for damages and cleaning it up.”<br />I thought to myself, “God has an Ohio policy?” I was screwed. The building needs brickwork along the roof parapet wall, gutter work, the 18 new windows, tree removal and emergency board-up.</td>

      <td>Portugal’s strongman didn’t go in for bombastic display or ideological extremes. Franco thought his only fault was his modesty.</td>
      <td>If Americans know of António de Oliveira Salazar at all, most do so unwittingly—and thanks to “Casablanca.” Although never mentioned by name in the film, the Portuguese dictator was its hero. His Portugal was stubbornly neutral during World War II, which is why two of the movie’s characters risked their lives to fly from a colonial outpost of Vichy France to the safety of Lisbon. As the Nazis overran Europe, the Portuguese capital became a sanctuary from which refugees escaped to America.<br />Salazar came to power in 1932, aged only 43, in an era when Europe bristled with dictators. The Portuguese strongman was the lone “benevolent autocrat” in a cohort that comprised Hitler, Mussolini, Franco and Stalin. So reckons Tom Gallagher in “Salazar: The Dictator Who Refused to Die,” a learned and lively biography of a man who governed Portugal for 36 years, running it “very much like a punctilious head butler in charge of a sprawling country estate.”<br />Salazar’s end came not from an uprising but from an accident, in 1968. In one of those cosmic blows that can descend on men who lead lives of obsessive caution, a deck chair in which he was sitting (awaiting a haircut) buckled and collapsed. His head hit a stone floor, and he never fully recovered his faculties. He died two years later, probably unaware, Mr.Gallagher tells us, that he was no longer ruling Portugal.<br />Franco, his Spanish counterpart, believed that Salazar’s “only defect is probably his modesty.” Mr. Gallagher, an emeritus professor of politics at the University of Bradford in the U.K., confirms this trait, without ever casting it in a negative light, describing Salazar as “self-effacing, dedicated to his duties, shunning uniforms or bombastic displays.” Unlike Franco, who could be a panjandrum, Salazar was sober and scholarly—and had he not been quite so dapper might even be considered a nerd. Although he enjoyed the company of women, he never married. Whispers that he had a sexual relationship with his housekeeper of five decades—Maria de Jesus Caetano Freire, or “Dona Maria”—could be said to have been silenced after a postmortem examination in 1981 revealed that she died in a virgin state.<br />Salazar attended a Catholic seminary as a young man, but with his passion for politics, Mr. Gallagher writes, he had doubts that he could “maintain the humility that the church demanded of its shepherds.” He went to the University of Coimbra, Portugal’s pre-eminent educational institution, and rose to become a professor of economics, serving for four years as finance minister in a government that had come to power in a military coup in 1926. If ever a coup were needed, this was the time: Portugal’s monarchy had been toppled in 1910, and the chaotic Portuguese republic saw 44 governments come and go in the space of 16 years.</td>

      <td>The U.S. has long battled Beijing’s resistance to overseas inspections of Chinese companies’ audits</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The House unanimously approved legislation on Wednesday that threatens a trading ban of shares of Chinese companies such as  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  over concerns that their audits aren’t sufficiently regulated.<br />The bipartisan measure passed the Senate in May and could quickly become law with President Trump’s signature. The fight over China’s resistance to allowing overseas inspections of its companies’ audits has lasted for years but reached a fever pitch during the Trump administration.<br />Under the measure, Chinese companies and their auditors would have three years to comply with the inspections before a trading prohibition could take effect. If a breakthrough looked unlikely, the companies would probably respond ahead of a ban by either going private or moving their listing to a non-U.S. exchange.<br />U.S. regulators are working on another proposal that could allow Chinese auditors to comply with the inspection requirement without violating their home country’s laws, which limit the sharing of information. The Securities and Exchange Commission could issue such a proposal this month, although it wouldn’t immediately take effect.<br />Chinese firms have raised money from U.S. shareholders for years, but their auditors violate a fundamental investor protection: China typically won’t allow American regulators to check their work. Chinese companies including  Luckin Coffee Inc.  have imploded in accounting scandals over the past decade, raising awareness of the audit-inspection gap.</td>

      <td>Michael Morell’s views about interrogation tactics prompt criticism, and a new candidate emerges</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Some Democratic senators have privately expressed concern to Joe Biden’s transition team about the president-elect’s consideration of intelligence veteran Michael Morell to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, citing Mr. Morell’s defense of the spy agency’s interrogation tactics after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Within the past two weeks, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) and Sen. Martin Heinrich (D., N.M.) voiced reservations about Mr. Morell, a former acting director of the CIA who had been widely seen by lawmakers and former officials as a top contender for the job, these people said.<br />Their doubts add to those publicly expressed last week by Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who said he would oppose Mr. Morell’s nomination for the post, which has been left unspecified even as Mr. Biden has moved quickly to name other senior national-security personnel.<br />The behind-the-scenes outreach came as other names have emerged as potential picks for the job, including David Cohen, a former top Treasury Department official who later served as deputy CIA director under President Barack Obama and is being actively considered by Mr. Biden, according to a person familiar with the matter. Unlike Mr. Morell, Mr. Cohen isn’t seen by progressives as someone who has defended the interrogation program.<br />Mr. Cohen, a partner at the WilmerHale law firm, spent much of his government career specializing in sanctions and financial intelligence, overseeing efforts at Treasury to counter money laundering, halt terrorist financing and craft sanctions regimes on Russia, North Korea and other entities. He joined the CIA in 2015, long after the interrogation program ended.</td>

      <td>In White House address, the president again said he won the election, even as states move forward certifying Joe Biden’s victory</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Trump delivered a lengthy speech from the White House on Wednesday in which he insisted that he won the election and again declined to concede to President-elect Joe Biden less than two months before Inauguration Day.<br />The address—which wasn’t on Mr. Trump’s public schedule and which he called “maybe the most important speech I’ve ever made”—marked the latest rhetorical escalation by the president as he continues to contest the results of an election he lost.<br />Mr. Biden, meanwhile, is moving forward with planning for the White House. He has announced key cabinet officials and his team has begun coordinating with the Trump administration. Mr. Biden’s transition team didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />“If we are right about the fraud, Joe Biden can’t be president,” Mr. Trump said in the 46-minute recorded speech from the White House Diplomatic Reception Room as he ticked through a slew of statements that have been proved false or that his campaign hasn’t substantiated in court.<br />Mr. Trump asserted that he won the election “without question,” even though the Associated Press said Mr. Biden would receive 306 Electoral College votes, well over the 270 needed to secure the presidency. The six most hotly contested battleground states have all certified their results for Mr. Biden, and Mr. Biden’s lead in the national popular vote currently stands at nearly seven million.</td>
