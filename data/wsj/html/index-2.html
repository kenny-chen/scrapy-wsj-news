      <td>With storage space running out, prime minister says move is safe, but fishery groups fear reputational damage</td>
      <td>TOKYO—Japan said Tuesday it would release water with low levels of radiation from the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into the sea despite opposition from a local fishing industry struggling to recover from the impact of 2011 meltdowns.<br />The plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., is running out of storage space for more than a million cubic tons of the water, which contains a radioactive isotope of hydrogen called tritium.<br />Government officials said the level of radiation was a tiny fraction of what people are exposed to in everyday life and Japan’s move followed standard practice among other global nuclear operators.<br />Dealing with the water “is an issue we cannot avoid in proceeding with the decommissioning of Fukushima Daiichi,” said Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga in announcing the move. He called the water release a practical solution and said the government would “ensure safety far in excess of standards.”<br />Representatives of the fishing industry expressed concern about the reputation of seafood caught near Fukushima. “It is nearly certain that there will be damage from rumors,” said Hiroshi Kishi, head of the national fisheries cooperative group, after meeting Mr. Suga on April 7 to discuss the plans.</td>

Both would be the first women to serve in their roles, if confirmed by the Senate.<br />Ms. Abizaid, who goes by Christy, has discussed a role with the Biden administration since December, a person familiar with the matter said. She previously served for nearly a decade as a counterterrorism intelligence officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency and worked on the National Security Council staff under President Barack Obama. After leaving government, Ms. Abizaid joined  Dell Technologies ,  where she currently serves as an executive in operations.<br />Ms. Wormuth previously served as undersecretary of defense for policy during the Obama administration and as the senior director for defense policy on the National Security Council. She is currently director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the RAND Corporation.<br />While the National Counterterrorism Center traditionally has focused on foreign terrorism, under President Biden it is expected to take on a greater role addressing domestic threats, working alongside other federal agencies, current and former officials said.</td>

      <td>The La Soufrière volcano on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent began a series of explosive eruptions on April 9, sending clouds of hot ash some 20,000 feet into the air, blanketing much of the island in ash and causing water and electricity outages.<br />The latest and biggest eruption so far took place early on Monday, April 12, when the volcano sent deadly clouds of hot gas, ash and stones down the mountainsides, according to Richard Robertson, professor of geology at the University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre.<br />“I suspect that the buildings and the structures that are on the mountain are destroyed, damaged, mashed up,” said Mr. Robertson in an online interview with St. Vincent Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves. “I shudder to think if any living creatures were on that mountain. Because anything that was there, man, animal, anything…they are gone.”<br />So far, there are no reports of deaths or injuries. Some 16,000 residents near the volcano were evacuated a day before the eruptions began, as scientists grew concerned about growing activity on the volcano, which killed an estimated 1,600 people during a violent 1902 eruption. But an unknown number of residents have declined to be moved, according to island officials.<br />The explosions at the 3,864 foot volcano could continue for days or weeks, according to the UWI Seismic Research Centre.</td>

I am here in a different bloc—the bloc that voted for me to serve my people,” Mr. Abbas said in a speech a few days after the vote.<br />Yohanan Plesner, president of the Jerusalem-based Israel Democracy Institute, said Mr. Abbas’s willingness to support Mr. Netanyahu or another contender is a potential game-changer for Israeli politics. Until now, Arab-Israeli parties have largely focused on the historic conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and have been reluctant to play a role in any Israeli government.

Mr. Lasso, who is 65, has the challenge of digging his country out of its worst economic crisis in a generation, product of a Covid-19 pandemic that has killed more than 17,000 people.<br />“Lasso, if nothing else, is very pragmatic, and in Ecuador today that demands close relationships with the United States and also China,” said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy group. “The country is in dire straits, and taking sides or excluding one of the countries is not realistic.”<br />Ecuador is now so saddled with debt to Beijing that public coffers are nearly empty, forcing the country to restructure debt with private creditors and take a $6.5 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.<br />Under President Rafael Correa, who served until 2017 and guided his country away from the U.S. and toward China, Beijing’s largess built everything, from dams to mines and hospitals. The debt load is huge—$18.4 billion, the third highest in Latin America and behind two far bigger countries, Brazil and Venezuela, according to the Inter-American Dialogue.</td>

      <td>Biden’s ‘infrastructure’ bill is really a plan to remake the economy.</td>
      <td>Candidate Joe Biden emphatically denied that he supported the Green New Deal. As with so much else, President Biden is now a convert. His $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan contains enough spending and industrial planning that it amounts to the Green New Deal in disguise.<br />Listen to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who two weeks ago claimed maternity for the President’s plan. “As much as I think some parts of the party try to avoid saying ‘Green New Deal’ and really dance around and try to not use that term, ultimately, the framework I think has been adopted,” the progressive heroine from Queens boasted. The details prove her point.<br />Mr. Biden is pitching his plan as having a big economic return on federal investment—and better roads, bridges and ports could increase productivity. But more than half of his plan is dedicated to reducing CO2, with a goal of eliminating fossil fuels with a mix of federal spending, subsidies and regulation. This is a political project with suspect returns.<br />• Start with $213 billion to build and retrofit two million energy-efficient homes and buildings. These putative “upgrades” would be financed by federal grants, tax credits and the economically inefficient Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).<br />A 2018 study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics of the WAP in Michigan found that its upfront investment costs are about twice the actual energy savings. “Even when accounting for the broader societal benefits derived from emissions reductions, the costs still substantially outweigh the benefits; the average rate of return is approximately −7.8% annually,” the study found.</td>

An invasion to grab more Ukrainian territory is also possible. The U.S. Navy has dispatched two ships to the region.<br />On Monday the U.S. also joined the other G-7 foreign ministers asking Mr. Putin to cease and desist: “These large-scale troop movements, without prior notification, represent threatening and destabilizing activities. We call on Russia to cease its provocations and to immediately de-escalate tensions in line with its international obligations.”<br />Mr. Putin has never been one for “international obligations,” so don’t expect the G-7 to scare him—even when the foreign ministers also demand, as they did, that he follow “the procedure established under Chapter III of the Vienna Document.” International law: Such a lovely fiction.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken was somewhat more forceful Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press”: “So the question is: Is Russia going to continue to act aggressively and recklessly? If it does, the President has been clear there’ll be costs, there’ll be consequences.”</td>

Mr. Chauvin, 45, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter.<br />Prosecutors are expected to formally rest their case on Tuesday, a spokesman said. Eric Nelson, Mr. Chauvin’s attorney, will then try to raise reasonable doubt in the jurors’ minds, presenting evidence that he has said will show that Mr. Floyd died of a drug overdose and a heart condition.<br />Judge Peter Cahill said he expected closing arguments would begin on Monday.<br />In the final day of prosecution testimony, the team led by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison touched on the two main pillars of its case. A cardiologist said Mr. Floyd died of a lack of oxygen, and used the video and medical evidence to rule out other factors, including his drug use or a heart attack. A law professor who studies police use of force testified that Mr. Chauvin faced a limited threat from the handcuffed Mr. Floyd that fell to zero after he stopped breathing even as Mr. Chauvin continued a dangerous type of restraint.</td>

      <td>Pritzker shows Mayor Lightfoot that public unions are his priority—school reopening, not so much.</td>
      <td>Most fights in one-party states are internecine. In Illinois, the Democrats who control Springfield have all but declared war on Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who is trying to prevent her city’s further decline.<br />The Chicago Teachers Union is threatening to walk out—again—over the school district’s plan to reopen high schools next week. “Critical sticking points include accommodations, high school schedules that minimize virus transmission, remote work—particularly since the majority of students will remain remote—and vaccines for high school students and their family members,” the union said Monday.<br />The union would rather not reopen at all this school year. And thanks to legislation signed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker, the district can’t require it. The statute repeals part of an Illinois law that had restricted the teachers’ right to strike over subjects other than wages and benefits.<br />Now teachers can walk out over schedules, remote learning or even child-care subsidies. While the union fought reopening elementary and middle schools earlier this spring, teachers risked having their pay docked if they struck. Now if the district pushes to reopen high schools, the union can call a strike with impunity and shut down all schools.<br />Ms. Lightfoot strongly opposed the bill. “Now is not the time to change the rules of engagement,” she wrote to legislators. “CPS and CTU agreed on a 5-year contract in 2019. It would be unprecedented for the General Assembly to make substantial changes to the bargaining relationship during the terms of this agreement.”</td>

      <td>New York could replicate Success Academy’s winning model, but standing up to the bureaucracy will take courage.</td>
      <td>New York<br />It would be comic if it weren’t so tragic. A 2019 University of California, Los Angeles study awarded New York City’s public schools first place in segregating black students and second in segregating Latino students. How is this possible? How could the schools in a city dominated by the left and led by Mayor Bill de Blasio, a progressive standard-bearer, be more segregated than those in states where Jim Crow laws once reigned and Confederate monuments still stand?<br />The answer isn’t that New Yorkers are especially prejudiced but rather that we have a shortage of good schools. At most of the city’s public schools, a majority of students either aren’t proficient in reading and math or fail to graduate with the skills necessary to succeed in college. Understandably reluctant to send their children to such schools, affluent families find better options either by moving to neighborhoods zoned for excellent schools or paying to prepare their children for admissions tests at selective schools. And this results in segregation since these affluent families are disproportionately white.<br />Predictably, Mayor de Blasio’s solution is redistribution: Spots at good schools must be redistributed from the “haves” to the “have nots” by using new admissions criteria reverse-engineered to produce the required result. What this ignores is the supply problem. If you don’t create additional good schools, restricting access to the existing ones will merely force well-off families out of the public school system altogether.<br />The challenge is that New York’s pre-K programs are weak, so children enter school with wildly varying levels of academic preparedness. This makes it hard to create racially and economically diverse schools that meet the needs of all students. But it’s not impossible. I know because I’ve done it many times over.</td>

But the patients hospitalized with B.1.1.7 didn’t die at higher rates or have worse outcomes overall.<br />The findings add to scientists’ understanding of B.1.1.7’s impact, which has become especially important now that the strain has come to dominate cases in the U.K., U.S. and some other countries.<br />“If you need hospitalization, you’re not worse with this variant compared to the previous virus strain,” said Eleni Nastouli, a clinical virologist and pediatrician at University College London and senior author on the paper.<br />“Of course, if you’re requiring hospital admission for Covid, that is a worry,” she added. “But it’s not more than the previous strain.”</td>

      <td>His definition of the term  is not what the American people think it means.</td>
      <td>During his Monday Oval Office meeting with Republican lawmakers to seek GOP support for his $2 trillion infrastructure bill, Joe Biden pushed back on the idea that the meeting was no more than bipartisan “window dressing.” The president calls his plan “a historic investment” that will redress America’s “crumbling infrastructure” and says he’s willing to negotiate. But a recent slip by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg reveals that what the Biden administration means by infrastructure is not at all what the American people think it means.<br />Mr. Buttigieg is one of the five cabinet secretaries the president has designated to sell the plan to the American people. In an interview last week with TheGrio.com, he declared “there is racism physically built into some of our highways,” and that this racism was a “conscious choice,” not “just an act of neglect.” If this is truly what Mr. Buttigieg and the administration believe, the trillions they are about to spend will almost certainly end up going less to actual infrastructure needs than some as-yet-to-be defined measure of “equity.”<br />Perhaps Mr. Buttigieg has a case. If so, he and the president should be more forthright in detailing exactly what the administration means when it says the American Jobs Plan “prioritizes addressing long-standing and persistent racial injustice.” Is this limited to targeting “40 percent of the benefits of climate and clean infrastructure investments to disadvantaged communities”? What other agendas might they be piling on here?<br />Because when most Americans hear the word infrastructure, they think of physical structures—roads, bridges, airports, power lines—with clear operational benefits. Infrastructure projects of this sort are popular because people can at least see something tangible for their tax dollars. The administration understands this, which is why, even though roads and bridges are only a fraction of this bill, whenever its salesmen get in trouble pitching it, that’s right where they run.<br />Mr. Buttigieg’s appearance on “Fox News Sunday” is a good example. Host Chris Wallace opened by hammering the secretary for not being “straight” with the American people in claiming the U.S. is ranked 13th globally for infrastructure. (He later also forced Mr. Buttigieg to concede that his estimate that the bill would create 19 million new jobs is not true. The honest estimate is closer to 2.7 million.)</td>

      <td>Former House Speaker John Boehner doesn’t understand why House Republicans went mad. Maybe it had something to do with him.</td>
      <td>John Boehner, the long-serving Republican congressman from Ohio, once had Nancy Pelosi’s job, though neither her ruthlessness nor her high profile. He left politics after serving almost five years as House speaker and now lobbies for marijuana legalization. His memoir is a mildly entertaining collection of homespun reminiscences of a middle-class upbringing, madcap anecdotes about Washington political life and profane barbs aimed at former adversaries. Mr. Boehner isn’t remembered as an effective House leader, but he was among the most plainspoken and least pretentious lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In any case, it’s hard to dislike a man who embraces his reputation as a chain smoker. There must be few quicker ways to make oneself repellent to the nation’s well-heeled political class, and yet he smoked his way all the way to the top legislative office in the land.<br />Unless I’m mistaken, Mr. Boehner wrote this book himself. He could have used a ghostwriter. Every page is heavy with stock phrases, and the author is constantly remarking on things he’ll “never forget as long as I live.” Occasionally the writing is dreadful. Recalling an episode in which Mrs. Pelosi essentially took a committee chairmanship from the legendary powerbroker John Dingell, Mr. Boehner remarks that she “gutted Big John Dingell like a halibut she found floating around San Francisco Bay.” “His entrails were left on display for everyone in the House of Representatives to see,” he goes on. Still, “I don’t think Nancy relished mounting Dingell on her wall.” Later, the reader will be glad to know, the author sees Mrs. Pelosi’s “iron grip on power backfire.”<br />The Washington press corps never cared much for Mr. Boehner, who had the misfortune of leading the Republican House during the tenure of the beloved Barack Obama, but the former speaker has attracted lavish media attention for “On the House: A Washington Memoir.” He has done this by the simple expedient of saying about the GOP what the news media says of it every day: namely, that it has become extreme and perverse and inhabited by “crazies” and “kooks.” That thesis is not without evidence, but Mr. Boehner does little more than state it in several different ways.<br />By “crazies” and “kooks”—or “nuts,” “far-right knuckleheads” and “the freak show set”—he is referring mainly to Republicans who first won office in 2010 and afterward, especially members of the conservative Freedom Caucus. Mr. Boehner took the speakership in 2011 and found himself between a fractious House majority and an administration that barely hid its contempt for Republicans. It was always going to be a difficult job, and it was made impossible by a coterie of House conservatives who badly overestimated their bargaining power. In 2013, for example, Freedom Caucusers and their correlatives in the Senate said they would vote to raise the debt limit only at the price of repealing ObamaCare, which was obviously never going to happen. Mr. Boehner rightly calls it “a dumbass idea.”<br />Mr. Boehner’s criticisms of his former antagonists on the right have almost exclusively to do with tactics, not with substance. He fails to acknowledge the distinction, although he insists repeatedly that he agreed with their stated goals. “I was one of the biggest evangelists for fiscal discipline there was,” he claims. How is it, then, that he can brand both the Freedom Caucus and the “Squad” as “political terrorists”? What distinguishes the members of the Squad, foremost among them Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, isn’t their willingness to pursue traditional Democratic goals by immoderate methods but their embrace of radical progressivism. The media buzz surrounding Mr. Boehner’s book has happily ignored this distinction and presented “On the House” as more evidence that the GOP has moved dramatically to the right. In fact, the party hasn’t moved much at all on policy, but it has become far more aggressive on tactical questions. Nor does Mr. Boehner exhibit the slightest curiosity about why, as he puts it, “the crazies came to town.” They just did, in his telling.</td>

      <td>It’s imprudent to weigh in on issues that don’t directly affect the company.</td>
      <td>A few CEOs have expressed their point of view about the new Georgia voting law. They have issued statements indicating their opposition on the basis that the law will suppress voting. Other senior executives, retired and active, have joined them. I know most of them by reputation and some personally. They are people of goodwill, who sincerely care about the nation, their companies and their employees and customers. Most have done excellent work as leaders of their companies. All have my respect and I believe have earned the respect of the public. But I believe they are wrong to take public positions on this law.<br />I believe both that voting ought to be relatively simple for citizens and that verification of eligibility to vote should be strict as a matter of principle. It is clear that any verification of ballot integrity will increase difficulty. In my view, the Georgia law reaches a reasonable trade-off between those two objectives.<br />But the reason I think CEOs should be silent on this issue isn’t because I disagree with their judgment on the merits. It’s because I think it is wrong for executives to take a company position on public-policy questions that don’t directly affect their business, for four reasons.<br />First, while these CEOs have the right to their own opinions, they can never speak merely as individuals; they always speak for and represent the companies they head. As CEOs they have the right, and perhaps the obligation, to speak out on matters affecting their organizations, but unless they have asked their boards for approval before speaking, they don’t have that right on unrelated matters.<br />Second, inevitably their announcements on purely political issues will alienate many of their employees and customers. Those positions will always lead to unintended consequences. In the Georgia situation, it immediately prompted Major League Baseball to move the All-Star Game to Denver, which then brought on charges of hypocrisy because of baseball’s close ties to two dictatorships—Cuba and China. It also generated calls to boycott two major Atlanta-based companies. This won’t be the end of the backlash.</td>

      <td>Federal Reserve Bank of Boston leader Eric Rosengren on Monday said monetary policy is in the right place for the challenges now facing the economy and that it will be some time before the Federal Reserve will need to contemplate a change on that front.<br />“Being too precise about exactly when lift off is going to be, I don’t think we have that foresight to be quite honest,” Mr. Rosengren said in a Wall Street Journal interview following a virtual speech earlier in the day.<br />When it comes to when the economy has recovered enough for the Fed to contemplate raising rates, “I think we’re two years away from when that likely is going to become a much more important question,” Mr. Rosengren said.<br />“We still have a lot of labor market slack, the [labor force] participation rate is still quite low relative to prior to the pandemic, and the unemployment rate is still at 6%. So we need to get rid of the slack, have a sustained inflation rate, before we need to worry about raising rates,” he said.<br />In his formal remarks, Mr. Rosengren said that, “I expect a return of the economy to pre-pandemic levels will likely take longer than many private forecasters expect,” adding “my perspective is that the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is appropriate.”</td>

      <td>The Soviet-Japanese pact signed 80 years ago today was part of Stalin’s plot that led to Pearl Harbor.</td>
      <td>On April 13, 1941, Japan’s foreign minister, Yosuke Matsuoka, and the Soviet commissar of foreign affairs, Vyacheslav Molotov, signed a neutrality pact, valid for five years. Although less notorious than the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviets and the Nazis, which plunged Europe into war, the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact had similar consequences in Asia.<br />As the London News Chronicle observed in reporting on the agreement: “What better guarantee [for Stalin] against Japanese hostility than that Japan turn south and cross swords with the United States? Moscow will feel secure in the Far East only when the Japanese and American navies engage.” Matsuoka and Stalin vowed Japan and the U.S.S.R. would “annihilate Anglo-Saxon ideology” and build a “new world order.” Matsuoka, a nationalist surprised to have signed a treaty with Japan’s Communist archenemy, later called Stalin’s neutrality pact an “act of diplomatic blitzkrieg.”<br />For years, there had been a tug-of-war in Tokyo between army and navy over strategy. The army’s “strike north” scheme envisioned a rapid conquest of Siberia to eliminate the Communist threat. Japan’s admirals, by contrast, war-gamed seizing resource-rich U.S. and European territories in Southeast Asia, in case Japan was ever cut off from American resources—especially oil—in retaliation for its 1937 invasion of China.<br />While many historians view the attack on Pearl Harbor as the inevitable outgrowth of U.S.-Japanese tensions, until April 1941 Japan’s factions remained in delicate balance, as did its relations with the Soviet Union, Britain and the U.S. Matsuoka’s brief on his European trip was to ascertain Hitler’s intentions: Would he invade Britain across the English Channel, or turn east and attack Soviet Russia?<br />Had Hitler told Matsuoka the truth and asked for help, it is likely that Japan would have attacked Siberia in coordination with Germany’s Operation Barbarossa, sparing Pearl Harbor. By refusing to trust Matsuoka but letting Ribbentrop drop hints about his plans, Hitler gave Matsuoka motivation to betray him by agreeing to a deal with Stalin, almost out of spite. Matsuoka was drinking heavily with Stalin when he signed the neutrality pact and was still sozzled when Stalin saw him off at the Moscow train station: Witnesses noted that Matsuoka “laughed with glee.”</td>

The conference has now been postponed until a later date.<br />The administration had hoped the Turkey talks would yield a cease-fire agreement and an interim government that included the Taliban, enabling U.S. and NATO allies to withdraw their troops after 20 years. The talks were designed to replicate the format of the conference held in Bonn, Germany, where senior Afghans selected a leader for Afghanistan after the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001.<br />In an article posted to its English-language Voice of Jihad website, which often reflects the thinking among the group’s members, the Taliban denounced the U.S. proposal for an interim government and said similar efforts had failed.</td>

Dubbed Grace, after the famed computer scientist Grace Hopper, the chip is based on technology developed by Arm Ltd., a U.K. chip designer that Nvidia is in the process of buying for around $40 billion.<br />The new chip puts Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia, known for its speedy processors that power videogaming hardware, squarely in competition with Intel, which dominates the global market in supplying chips to data centers, according to Mercury Research. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is a distant second in chips for data centers.<br />Nvidia last year overtook Intel as the largest chip maker by market value. Its stock has soared in part because of Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s bet on some of the hottest fields in tech, videogaming and artificial intelligence.<br />The company said that the Grace chip aims to be able to handle a targeted segment of computing where processors need to analyze vast sets of data quickly, a process that requires fast computing performance and massive memory. It can be used for such tasks as language processing and artificial intelligence.</td>

A new narrative may soon be at hand. In a recent interview with comedian Jimmy Kimmel, the president’s 51-year-old son offered an intriguing claim about his business career. And it could be very useful to the corporate communications staff at China-based BHR, as well as the good folks at Ukraine’s Burisma and other overseas outfits that have paid him implausibly large sums.<br />Mr. Biden is still not claiming to be an expert in Chinese finance or Ukrainian energy or Romanian corruption statutes or Russian real estate. But in defending his lucrative arrangement with Burisma during an appearance on the Kimmel show, Mr. Biden said that he had “expertise in corporate governance.” And what would foreign oligarchs do without corporate governance experts?<br />If true, this new Biden claim suggests at least the possibility that all of the millions of dollars he’s collected overseas really were legitimate. Maybe the foreign tycoons were not simply renting a Biden for purposes of Washington influence.<br />This sure seems like news, and tailor-made for media folk who still enjoy offering rebuttals against Donald Trump even though he has left public office and is not even allowed to speak on social media.<br />Yet for whatever reason, even though Hunter Biden is on a book tour, the press seems largely uninterested in his story.

Revenue rose 13% to $268 billion, while spending increased 161% to $927 billion—the third-highest total on record, after June and April of last year.<br />The government’s spending surge has provided some cushion to the economy from the pandemic’s devastation, but it has also sent the federal debt soaring to levels not seen since the end of World War II as a proportion of the economy. Weaker tax revenue has contributed to the budget shortfall.<br />“While much of the borrowing of the past year was unquestionably warranted, we are now becoming dangerously numb to the trillions in debt that are piling up,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “We need to start paying for what we spend.

      <td>How long does protection from Covid vaccines last? It’s a question that’s becoming more important as some of the first people to be vaccinated approach four months post-inoculation.<br />The short answer is: We don’t fully know yet. But more data is coming in that provides clues. Here’s what we know so far.<br />Recent data from  Pfizer ,  the manufacturer of one of the three vaccines available in the U.S., indicates that protection lasts at least six months. The results showed minimal antibody decline. Recipients of the Moderna vaccine also had robust levels of antibodies more than six months later, according to a recent study published in NEJM.<br />Some people have incorrectly concluded that means that those vaccines offer only six months of protection, says Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. “That’s false,” says Dr. Hensley. “We only have six months of data...Six months from now it’s likely we’ll learn we have one year of protection.”<br />The vaccines will likely provide at least some degree of protection for a long time because there are so many layers of immunity, says Deepta Bhattacharya, an associate professor of immunobiology at the University of Arizona in Tucson.</td>

The review will look at whether the company provided good value for taxpayers and how its contracts were secured.<br />Greensill’s implosion has spread damage across the world of finance, hitting its financing partner Credit Suisse Group AG and its biggest outside investor, a fund managed by  SoftBank Group Corp.<br />Greensill’s tight connections with the world of politics have also raised concerns about its relationships with government actors in the U.K. and elsewhere.<br />A representative for Greensill, which filed for bankruptcy last month after it lost credit insurance that was crucial to its business, declined to comment. Greensill had a contract to provide supply-chain financing, used by companies to stretch out the time they have to pay their bills, to the government-funded National Health Service.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden called for a bipartisan push to strengthen the U.S. semiconductor industry during a meeting with auto and tech executives that he used to pitch his $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal.<br />“I’ve been saying for some time now, China and the rest of the world is not waiting,” Mr. Biden said Monday afternoon. “And there’s no reason why Americans should wait. We’re investing aggressively in areas like semiconductors and batteries; that’s what they’re doing and others, so must we.”<br />Mr. Biden spoke during a meeting between top administration officials and senior executives of  Ford  Motor Co.,  General Motors Co. ,  Intel Corp. ,  Alphabet Inc.  and others to address the global chip shortage that has led to production slowdowns with auto manufacturing and other industries. The executives appeared via video.<br />Chips are used across an array of industries—in autos, software is used to control everything from brakes to air bags—and supply has dwindled with growing demand for products as Covid-19 has shifted work and entertainment habits.<br />Mr. Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal includes $50 billion for the American semiconductor industry, whose lobbying efforts have gained momentum amid the shortage and fears that China might be overtaking the U.S. in a critical technology. The president said semiconductors, along with things like expanding broadband, are critical infrastructure.</td>

The vessel was moored off the coast of northwest Saudi Arabia by the proposed futuristic city of Neom, a signature of the crown prince’s efforts to modernize the country.<br />The painting’s fate after its $450 million sale in 2017 has captivated the art world. The work hasn’t been seen publicly since, with some art-world insiders alleging it was being stored in a warehouse in Switzerland. A person who saw the artwork displayed in the Serene last year said he was “very surprised it was not in Switzerland as others believe.” Others knew it was in Saudi Arabia but didn’t know exactly where.<br />The crown prince’s sleek, black-and-white yacht—which he bought in late 2016 after it was outfitted in 2011 with two helipads, three swimming pools, a dozen luxury cabins and an indoor climbing wall—is now in a Dutch shipyard for maintenance. Shortly before the Serene left for maintenance, the painting was moved to a secret location inside Saudi Arabia, two people familiar with the situation said.<br />Rumors about the painting’s whereabouts have been swirling since art dealer Kenny Schachter wrote on Artnet.com in June 2019 that it was whisked away in the middle of the night and relocated to the yacht.</td>

It could also dent the swelling coronavirus-skepticism across East and Central Africa that was led by the late president and has been flourishing in the region’s most impoverished states.<br />To shift the policy, however, she must walk a political tightrope. She needs to address the public-health risks of the disease, which many think killed not only Mr. Magufuli but thousands of Tanzanians, while retaining the support of the majority of the country’s religious conservatives who have strongly backed the late president’s position.<br />Ms. Hassan, whose rise to power makes her Tanzania’s first female president and Africa’s only elected female leader, now appears to see a change in her country’s stance on coronavirus as vital. There is increasing concern from health experts that an uncontrolled outbreak has been raging across Tanzania, with cases also rising among travelers to the East African nation, ordinarily popular with tourists.</td>

Now this offseason will feature a new kind of turmoil: a huge wave of players who are rushing to change which team they play for.<br />Just one week after the season officially ended with Baylor cutting down the nets to win the national title, 1,296 players have indicated a desire to transfer by entering the NCAA’s “transfer portal,” a national database introduced in 2018 that lets players broadcast their intention to leave without first obtaining permission from their current school. That is more than double the 600 or so who switched schools via the transfer portal last season.<br />That means that more than 28% of the more than 4,500 Division I scholarship men’s basketball players could be on the move this offseason.<br />“It’s like a big game of musical chairs. And the interesting thing to me is going to be when the music stops,” said Tad Boyle, the coach at Colorado, where six of the 18 players have indicated they intend to transfer.<br />The huge uptick in players transferring comes as players are anticipating that the NCAA will soon change its rule that requires athletes in some sports, including basketball, to sit out a year if they choose to transfer. Some conferences have already enacted such rules.</td>

Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip were the guests of honor, there presumably to bear witness that, after a couple of centuries, the unfortunate business over the repeated injuries and usurpations inflicted by one of her ancestors had been quietly forgotten.<br />The ambassador rose to give the not-so-loyal toast.<br />He began with the inevitable nod to the two nations’ divergent histories, noting that some time earlier, in their great wisdom, his compatriots had decided to go it alone.<br />“Oh yes!” cried the prince from a sedentary position, fortified, no doubt, by a couple of glasses of the embassy’s very good wine. “And how’s that working out for you?”<br />It was a good question then, and it’s more apt than ever now given America’s current predicament. The people that once boldly threw off the tyranny of a distant monarch now seem to be meekly submitting to the diktats of a regnant class and ideology that tolerate less independence of thought and action than King George III did.</td>

      <td>Nobody in Washington seems to care about the long-term burdens of debt and dependency.</td>
      <td>Where has all the money gone? Where will all the money go? No one really knows. Few seem to care.<br />I left the private sector in 2010 to campaign for the U.S. Senate. I began serving in 2011, when the country’s total national debt was $14 trillion. At $28 trillion, it is now double that, with trillions more guaranteed to be added over the next few years.<br />In the private sector, we often have to remind ourselves to celebrate success because competition forces us to focus on solving problems and striving for continuous improvement. In government and politics, members of both parties love to celebrate bipartisan spending boondoggles, but few are willing to question—much less accept responsibility for—the harmful consequences: financial dependency, deficits and debt.<br />Emergency spending bills in the midst of crisis provide the best examples. The $800 billion American Recovery and Jobs Act of 2009 wasted money on gems like Crescent Dunes and Solyndra ($1.2 billion between the two, with zero jobs created). President Obama famously touted this bill, saying it would fund “shovel-ready projects” and create millions of “green” jobs. Later, Mr. Obama sheepishly admitted the projects weren’t very shovel-ready. Probably less than $100 billion of the $800 billion total was spent funding “infrastructure,” even using the most generous plausible definition of the term.<br />I have no doubt that President Biden’s 100% partisan $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and $2.25 trillion American Jobs Plan will be similarly unproductive. But like roosters taking credit for the dawn, Democrats will claim credit for a strong economic recovery in 2021 that will happen with or without these tax-and-spend blowouts. What Democrats won’t accept responsibility for is the harmful effects of growing dependency, long-term reduction in opportunity, and a future debt crisis.</td>

      <td>Researchers warn that the variant, now detected in the U.S. and more than 60 countries, may spread faster and could reduce the efficacy of vaccines</td>
      <td>A fast-spreading strain of the coronavirus, first discovered in South Africa, has been detected in at least 60 countries, including the U.S. The variant appears to make some Covid-19 vaccines less effective and has raised concerns that people who already had the disease could get it again from the new strain.<br />It is normal for viruses to mutate, and most mutations observed so far in the coronavirus sweeping the globe have made little difference to how it functions. The South African variant, known as B.1.351 or 501.V2, has worried scientists because of its unusually large number of mutations, especially in the spike protein, which the virus uses to attach to and infect human cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus targeted by Covid-19 vaccines and antibody treatments.<br />The discovery and spread of the variant in South Africa coincided with a powerful surge in infections in the country, although new cases have dropped sharply since peaking in January. South African researchers have said that B.1.351 may be around 50% more contagious, based on the much faster rate of Covid-19 transmission since its emergence and biological studies of changes to the structure of the virus, which appear to make it easier for it to attach to and infect human cells. The new strain quickly crowded out other versions of the virus circulating in South Africa and drove major waves of infections in several neighboring states. But it hasn’t become a major source of new infections outside the southern African region, likely due to limited travel during the pandemic. South African researchers say that the variant doesn’t appear to lead to more severe cases of Covid-19.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says only around 0.5% of Covid-19 infections in the U.S. since the beginning of the year are due to the B.1.351. That is far fewer than those caused by a separate variant, known as B.1.17, that was first detected in the U.K. and has now become the dominant strain in the U.S.<br /></td>

      <td>Acquisition of Nuance Communications adds to AI capabilities but represents high price for struggling business</td>
      <td>Microsoft ’s  deal makers finally landed on a target they can hit. They sure aren’t getting a bargain.<br />The past several months have seen the software giant reportedly go after TikTok,  Pinterest  and videogame social network Discord. The first two would have been the company’s most expensive deals ever, with Pinterest talks in the range of $51 billion, according to the Financial Times. In that light, Monday’s announcement of a $19.7 billion agreement with  Nuance Communications  might seem tame, though it still ranks as Microsoft’s second-largest acquisition behind the $26 billion spent for LinkedIn in 2016.<br />Nuance, though, is a notable departure from the previously rumored deals. TikTok, Pinterest and Discord all would have put Microsoft deep into the social networking space, where it currently has little presence. Nuance plays more in the company’s existing corporate technology wheelhouse, with speech recognition and artificial intelligence capabilities targeted at the healthcare market. Nuance’s systems are used in about 77% of U.S. hospitals, and Microsoft said in its announcement Monday that Nuance’s healthcare cloud revenue grew 37% in its fiscal year ended in September.<br />Nuance’s other businesses have struggled, though. Overall revenue has fallen over the past four years, mostly due to sharp declines in the company’s traditional software licensing business. But the stock is still up 168% over the past 12 months prior to Monday’s announcement, with a big jump after the company’s fiscal-year results in mid-November when it announced the divestiture of its medical transcription and electronic health record services. That put the stock in a record range of about 60 times forward earnings even without Microsoft’s offer—earning Nuance a place on a list of “Expensive Tech Stocks With Low Quality Scores” compiled by Bernstein Research last month.<br />With more than $75 billion in net cash, Microsoft has the third-largest war chest in tech after Google parent  Alphabet  Inc.  and  Apple  Inc.  Its strong record in cloud computing also earns the company some benefit of the doubt. Microsoft said Monday that it expects Nuance to add to adjusted per-share earnings for the fiscal year ending in June 2023, the first full year after the deal is expected to close. And compared with chasing a high-profile social network, purchasing Nuance will be much less likely to buy Microsoft a new kind of trouble.</td>

And an Oura Ring that also measures heart-rate variability along with resting heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature. “Yeah, I’m a little crazy on the devices,” says Ms. Cajide, director of strategy and operations at consulting firm Clareo.<br />She’s got good reason. After returning to competitive figure skating four years ago, she won a national championship. Then last September, she broke her leg while landing an Axel jump. Ms. Cajide, who is 44 years old, competes again in eight weeks—against many skaters half her age.<br />She is trying to override nearly nearly two decades as a “sedentary adult,” working in tech and investment banking. “I’m trying to make up for lost time. It’s me against time,” she says. “The sensors and data allow me to optimize for getting the most mileage out of my body.”<br />There is no escaping the Quantified Self movement. Measuring biomarkers used to be the preoccupation of extreme athletes and extreme geeks. No more.<br />“I think the attitude is shifting. The seriousness of the pandemic has made people realize that gosh, isn’t it a good idea to have a sensor,” says Michael Snyder, chairman of the department of genetics at Stanford University’s School of Medicine, whose research, among other studies, indicates data from smart watches—alterations in heart rate, steps and sleep—can be used to detect Covid-19 as early as nine days before symptoms.</td>

      <td>The much-buzzed launch of Mschf and Lil Nas X’s unsanctioned ‘Satan Shoes,’ pegged to the release of the artist’s single ‘Montero,’ was just one example of a slew of imaginatively remixed sneakers of late.</td>
      <td>By now, you’ve likely heard of the “Satan Shoes,” black-and-red modified  Nike  Air Max sneakers whose maker, a company called Mschf claimed they contain a drop of human blood in the sole. Released on March 29, the demonic-looking shoes were not—as was commonly misreported—an official Nike release. They were bootlegs created by the rapper Lil Nas X in partnership with Mschf, a controversy-baiting product design firm in Brooklyn. Within a week, the unauthorized shoes drew a blizzard of publicity, and Nike obtained a temporary restraining order against Mschf.<br />Last Thursday Nike and Mschf settled out of court, with Mschf agreeing to buy back the sneakers from customers at their original $1,018 price—Mschf claimed that 665 of the 666 pairs it produced had been sold. In a statement following the settlement, Nike reiterated that it “had nothing to do with the Satan Shoes,” and that “the parties are pleased to put this dispute behind them.” In an emailed statement, the lawyer at Debevoise & Plimpton representing the design studio, David Bernstein, wrote, “MSCHF recognized that settlement was the best way to allow it to put this lawsuit behind it so that it could dedicate its time to new artistic and expressive projects.”<br />The “Satan Shoes,” while particularly sensational, are in fact just the latest in a number of highly creative, highly unapproved bootleg sneakers that riff on well-known Nike designs. These shoes are not your traditional cheapo copies that knock off the exact look of an existing Nike model. Instead, they take a popular silhouette like the Air Jordan 1 or the Nike Dunk Low and rejigger the codes of the shoe, spicing it up as a DJ would remix an existing song.<br />This latest bootleg bonanza began in 2019, when Trevor Gorji, a 22-year-old college student at the University of Southern California, released his “One in the Chamber’’ sneakers under the brand name Fugazi. They looked like traditional red-and-white Jordan 1 high-tops, only the Swoosh was replaced by a revolver and the perforations on the toe resembled bullet holes. After that came fellow Californian Warren Lotas’s Nike Dunk lookalikes in 2020, which featured a Swoosh embellished with the face of the fictional “Friday the 13th’’ slasher Jason Voorhees. Those shoes were too close for comfort for Nike, and the Oregon sneaker titan sued Mr. Lotas. The two companies reached a settlement agreement late last year and Mr. Lotas has since issued more Dunk riffs, minus the conspicuous Swoosh. Warren Lotas didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />In more recent months there’s been a steady trickle of bootlegs by small sneaker makers. Orée, a New York startup, created the “Empire City Highs” which look like a pair of leather Jordan 1 shoes with a horizontal Statue of Liberty sitting where the Swoosh would go. Vandy the Pink, a Virginia and New York-based clothing customizer, created the “Burger Shoes,” with sesame-bun details and a fry replacing the Swoosh. And Plessume in Charlotte, N.C., has sold the “Slam High,” a black-and-cream Jordan-esque shoe with a blockier hockey-stick-looking Swoosh. Plessume, Vandy the Pink and Orée confirmed that Nike hadn’t contacted them about their designs while Mr. Gorji of Fugazi declined to reply whether Nike had reached out to him about the sneakers. Although it didn’t comment on specific examples or brands, Nike said it “will continue to act to enforce its rights in its trademarks and designs.”</td>

      <td>The woke’s mea culpa isn’t beating their breasts but beating ours for us.</td>
      <td>In his “Yes, Boycott Baseball” (Wonder Land, April 8), Daniel Henninger states: “Liberals have given in completely to the narcotic pleasure of total guilt.” I totally agree with “narcotic” and pleasure” but disagree with “guilt,” as explaining the woke phenomenon guilt is a painful act of self-incrimination. But this isn’t the feeling expressed by St. Augustine, who, looking at his past, couldn’t get over his youthful transgressions. The better reference to modern wokism is Augustine’s “City of God,” whose invisible citizens are divided into those who are and those who are not going to be saved, and whose diverging identities only God knows. But in the modern version, wokes already know they are going to heaven and are looking down on the rest of us, who are not so regretfully slated for the other place. In their minds, their easily acquired enlightenment has already saved them. Hence, if you noticed, their mea culpa isn’t beating their breasts but beating ours for us. They are not scourging themselves, but triumphantly administrating the whip to the backs of us sinners. No, this isn’t guilt. It is pride. Which, if we are to follow the religious analogies, comes before the fall.<br />Jack Kaczorowski<br />Los Angeles, Calif.</td>

      <td>Republicans have been proclaiming for several years now that they have become the party of the working class, and with some justification. Working-class voters have indeed been marching into the party.<br />There has been a problem, though. Many of these voters became Republicans for cultural reasons, turned off by Democrats’ drift leftward on social issues. But their new party, the GOP, didn’t have much in the way of actual economic policies to appeal to them.<br />In fact, quite the opposite: For ideological reasons, many conservative Republicans opposed the kinds of government programs to benefit working-class families that Democrats have long championed. To some extent, working-class voters had arrived in a party that at times appeared somewhere between indifferent and hostile to their economic needs.<br />Now, that is changing. Starting a couple of years ago, and increasingly since the coronavirus economic downturn, there has been a sprouting of new-wave conservative proposals designed to help working-class families, even if those plans required ditching traditional free-market economics and concerns about budget deficits.<br />A few examples:</td>

      <td>Semiconductors shortage is worsening, but might need to drag out indefinitely to have a greater impact on auto stocks</td>
      <td>The great car-chip shortage is bad for the auto industry, but only temporarily. The real losers are consumers who need wheels to get back to work.<br />General Motors said last week that it would suspend or reduce production at three plants previously unaffected by the global undersupply of semiconductors. Most big auto makers have now reduced output. Auto microchips are short because of order cuts made at the onset of the pandemic and very strong demand from other industries.<br />Lower production hits auto makers’ results because they book sales upon shipping inventory to dealers. In February, GM and  Ford  forecast that the impact on their 2021 operating profit would run into the billions of dollars. The semiconductor shortage has since worsened, so the estimated impact could be even greater when the companies report first-quarter results in this month.<br />Yet investors seem indifferent to the problem. This isn’t as crazy as it sounds, at least not yet.<br />For now, the bottlenecks remain temporary. A couple of months ago car makers hoped they would make up lost production in the second half of the year. That may now be optimistic. Still, as long as the problem doesn’t show signs of stretching out indefinitely, manufacturers should be able to regain most of the lost profits—and certainly their profit-generating potential—within 12 or 18 months. If investors can “look through” a global pandemic, they are unlikely to get hung up on delayed profits while semiconductor makers increase their capacity, even if it takes some time.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—Australia expects its Covid-19 vaccination campaign to be delayed by months because of concerns over side effects from the  AstraZeneca  PLC vaccine and supply-chain issues, in a setback that threatens to extend its border closure and weigh on its economic recovery.<br />Australia’s leaders had planned to have 4 million people vaccinated against the coronavirus by the end of March. But nearly two weeks into April, authorities have vaccinated only about 1.2 million people, or roughly 5% of the population. They had previously said they would aim to vaccinate its entire population by October but now aren’t sure when that might happen.<br />“Rather than set targets that can get knocked about by every to and fro of international supply chains and other disruptions that can occur, we’re just getting on with it,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Monday in a video posted to  Facebook .  Over the weekend, Mr. Morrison said he now hoped Australians could get a first dose before the end of the year, but he didn’t commit to that date and said the government wouldn’t set a new target.<br />Australian officials were relying in large part on the AstraZeneca vaccine because it can be produced locally. But they have blamed the slow rollout on a delay in shipping AstraZeneca vaccines from Europe, which was supposed to boost early vaccination efforts as Australia ramped up its ability to make the vaccines domestically.<br />The bet on AstraZeneca ran into further challenges last week when Australia’s drug regulator said the vaccine should be given only to people over 50 because of the risk of rare but sometimes deadly blood clotting. That forced Australian officials to restrict the rollout of the vaccine, with other countries taking similar steps.</td>

      <td>A Supreme Court decision that threw out the fraud convictions of two political aides to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is rippling through other white-collar cases, possibly buttressing appeals by other defendants who say federal prosecutors have become too aggressive in using antifraud laws to go after dishonest conduct.<br />In the New Jersey scandal known as Bridgegate, the high court ruled last year that a political-retribution scheme that involved crippling a town with traffic jams didn’t constitute federal fraud. The decision already has prompted the reversal of most charges in a high-profile insider-trading case, and could hurt prosecutors’ efforts to preserve convictions in a case that exposed ethical failures at one of the Big Four accounting firms.<br />At issue in both cases is when underhanded conduct may be considered criminal fraud. The Supreme Court affirmed in the New Jersey case that federal fraud charges apply only when a scheme seeks to obtain money or property by deceptive means.<br />In the insider-trading case, Manhattan federal prosecutors said on April 2 that because of the New Jersey case, most of the charges should be wiped out. They recommended to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that the entire case against Christopher Worrall, one of the defendants, be dismissed. Mr. Worrall, a former technical adviser at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was accused of sharing secrets about government-funding levels with a consultant working for a hedge fund.<br />In the same case, prosecutors also agreed to toss out insider-trading and theft charges against two hedge-fund traders and David Blaszczak, the political-intelligence consultant whom they allege passed on the information from Mr. Worrall.</td>

The delivery business, combined with cost cuts, helped cushion the pandemic’s hit on Uber’s core ride-hailing operations during the pandemic, and the company posted a narrower full-year loss in February.<br />Uber said it is on track to reach profitability in quarterly adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization this year.

On Monday, the head of Iran’s nuclear agency, Ali Akbar Salehi, said that parts of the enrichment facility were operating on emergency electricity. He also said all damaged centrifuges were IR-1s, the first generation of Iranian centrifuges and a workhorse of Tehran’s enrichment program.<br />The attack is a potential blow to Iran’s enrichment capabilities. Tehran has raised enrichment levels in recent months as part of efforts to push the U.S. to lift sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. Israel is strongly opposed to the nuclear deal, which it says only puts a temporary cap on Iran’s quest for nuclear weapons.<br />Tehran denies it is seeking to produce such weapons, and says its nuclear program is peaceful. It also said Sunday’s incident didn’t set back its enrichment program. “Enrichment in Natanz has not stopped and is moving forward vigorously,” said Mr. Salehi,<br />In another sign of the attack’s impact, the spokesman for Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, Behrouz Kamalvandi, fell down a hole more than 20 feet deep, cutting open his head and fracturing his ankle, as he visited Natanz on Sunday to inspect the damage, he told state television from his hospital bed.</td>

Having gotten both rounds of her vaccine, she was meeting a good friend and producer whom she works with on her Dare to Lead and Unlocking Us podcasts and whom she hadn’t seen in person in over a year. “It was so emotional. It was so weird. Hello? What’s happening?” she says. “We touched fingertips.” She says that the moment validated one of her beliefs: “We’re wired for human connection and story, and in the absence of it there is always pain and suffering.”<br />Her 2010 TEDx Talk, “The Power of Vulnerability,” a 20-minute presentation on her findings on the subject, has been viewed over 52 million times on TED’s website. She’s written best-selling books, including Rising Strong and The Gifts of Imperfection. The anthology she edited with #MeToo movement founder Tarana Burke, You Are Your Best Thing: Vulnerability, Shame Resilience and the Black Experience, comes out later this month, and she has another book debuting this fall that she says she can’t say much about. In 2019, she starred in the Netflix special Brené Brown: The Call to Courage, in which she led a talk on choosing courage and vulnerability over comfort, and she’s done leadership consulting with a number of companies and organizations.<br />In September, Brown signed a multiyear exclusive deal with Spotify, and moved her podcast on human connection and relationships, Unlocking Us, which she started in March 2020, over to the streaming platform this January. She debuted a second show for the company last October: Dare to Lead, a weekly chat on leadership and courage. On Dare to Lead, she’s interviewed guests including organizational psychologist Adam Grant, soccer star Abby Wambach and former President Barack Obama. Brown lives with her husband, pediatrician Steve Alley, and their two kids, Ellen, 21, and Charlie, 15. Here, she talks to WSJ. about vulnerability during the pandemic and whether everyone has the potential to be a leader.<br />What time do you get up on Mondays?

Its founder, who remains an executive, resigned as CEO amid his personal bankruptcy and was barred in China from running public companies.<br />Now under new leadership, seven-year-old Faraday & Future Inc. is poised to complete a public listing on a U.S. stock exchange within weeks that would value it at $3.4 billion, extending a change in fortune for a startup with a difficult past and no car sales.<br />Faraday is among the latest examples of an electric-vehicle startup without a clear record of success to raise hundreds of millions in capital and go public largely based on a vision of the future of transportation, owing to the booming popularity of an investment structure called special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs.<br />SPACs have allowed these startups to tap the enthusiasm among public-market investors and amateur stock traders for electric vehicles—an ardor that is driven, in part, by the idea that climate change and new regulations to cap carbon emissions will spur demand for such cars long term. Faraday announced in January a deal to raise more than $1 billion when it agreed to merge with a SPAC called  Property Solutions Acquisition Corp.<br />Los Angeles-based Faraday was founded in 2014 by Chinese entrepreneur Jia Yueting, who had risen to prominence with LeEco Holdings, a technology business he founded, before he fell into financial trouble. A Chinese court seized some of his assets in 2017, among several financial penalties China levied against the entrepreneur. The China Securities Regulatory Commission ordered Mr. Jia to return to the country to handle his debt.

Opponents also argue that any boost in wages or the unionization of home healthcare workers would ultimately funnel money—by way of dues—to Democratic-friendly labor unions.<br />The Biden administration doesn’t have any specific labor provisions in the plan, but changes that make it easier for home health workers to unionize could be part of a proposal from congressional Democrats. States led by Democrats—such as Oregon—have allowed independent home health workers paid by government programs like Medicaid to collectively bargain as public employees.<br />The diverging perspectives set the stage for a politically fraught battle over a proposal championed by Mr. Biden, who campaigned last year on ending waiting lists of seniors on Medicaid for home healthcare services.</td>

The nominated chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, has taught courses on cryptocurrency. The bitcoin market has experienced huge growth in recent months and now has the involvement of some big institutions. VanEck, Fidelity and others are again seeking regulatory approval for bitcoin ETFs.<br />Already there are indicators of big potential demand. The first bitcoin ETF in North America, the Toronto-listed  has amassed roughly $1 billion in assets since its February launch. Meanwhile, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust last week reiterated its longstanding intention to seek to convert its publicly traded bitcoin fund to an ETF.<br />Many analysts have attributed the fund shares’ recent move to trading at a discount to the net asset value of its bitcoin holdings—after trading at a sizable premium for a long time—in part to the advent of an ETF.<br />One advantage of ETFs is that shares can be readily created and redeemed to arbitrage away any discount or premium, which could greatly broaden their appeal. ETFs are also cheaper, which will put pressure on fees across the bitcoin ecosystem.</td>

And Boeing’s business challenges have hampered the company’s ability to attract directors, one of these people said.<br />Companies across industries are under pressure to diversify their boards, especially following racial-justice protests last summer as well as California legislation and a Nasdaq proposal requiring board diversity, recruiters and board members said. Boeing says its slate of 10 directors up for re-election includes two women and two people of color.</td>

      <td>Alibaba investors are relieved that the only thing they have to deal with is a huge fine. That could yet prove optimistic.</td>
      <td>When is getting fined $2.8 billion good news? Apparently, when you are Alibaba. Investors seem relieved that Beijing hasn’t done anything worse to China’s e-commerce champion after its dramatic fall from political favor. But that relief could prove premature.<br />Alibaba’s shares jumped 6.5% Monday—adding $40 billion to its market value—after China’s antitrust regulators imposed a record fine on the company over the weekend. Regulators say Alibaba pressured merchants to sell goods on its platform rather than those of its rivals, in a practice called er xuan yi, meaning “choose one out of two”.<br />While the fine—equivalent to 4% of Alibaba’s domestic annual sales—was higher than expected, investors are probably happy that the company’s fundamental business model remains intact. There are no forced divestitures or substantial changes to its corporate structure. The fact that Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms are popular among consumers probably counted in its favor with Beijing. Daniel Zhang, Alibaba’s chief executive, said Monday in a conference call that he didn’t expect a material impact on business operations.<br />Alibaba’s shares have lagged behind its peers’ recently, having lost nearly a quarter of their value since November, when regulators unexpectedly stopped the proposed initial public offering of its finance affiliate Ant Group. The fine, while large, is affordable for the company, which was sitting on $70 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of last year.<br />But the risk is that it may not be a one-off hit. Beijing used to be more hands off, but as internet companies have grown bigger and more powerful, the government has become more active in reining them in, in line with the trend seen in other countries. Apart from the record fine, Alibaba also has to revamp its operations to maintain fair competition and to protect merchants and consumers. And it needs to submit annual self-assessments to authorities for the next three years.</td>

Ms. Meng believes the papers will help her legal fight in Canada, where she is in hearings to try to prevent her extradition on charges related to alleged sanctions-busting sales to Iran.<br />Ms. Meng turned to the Hong Kong courts after losing an earlier legal battle in the U.K. to force HSBC to hand over the documents. Ms. Meng filed a legal action in Hong Kong in February, just days after a judge in London’s High Court declined to order HSBC to hand over the documents, saying he didn’t have the jurisdiction to do so.<br />In Hong Kong on Monday, Judge Linda Chan told the courtroom in a hearing lasting just a few minutes that she approved a deal between the two sides, including on how the documents will be redacted. Few details were disclosed.<br />While confirming an agreement had been reached, representatives for both Huawei and HSBC didn’t elaborate.</td>

      <td>Domestically oriented companies might fare best as the U.S. economy powers ahead and foreign earnings face tax hike</td>
      <td>For U.S. companies right now, there’s no place like home.<br />Take a look around the world, where in most places neither vaccination campaigns nor the level of government fiscal support come close to matching what is happening in the U.S. That ought to be enough to convince investors that domestic-facing American companies are better positioned than those that generate much of their revenue abroad. If that doesn’t suffice, the infrastructure plan that the White House has put forth—and some of the tax reforms it has proposed to pay for it—ought to do the trick.<br />The U.S. is on pace to fully vaccinate over three-quarters of its adult population by the start of summer. With current vaccines so far apparently effective even against the more transmissible coronavirus variants now spreading, the country seems likely to further open up the economy in the months ahead. Among other major developed countries, only the U.K.’s vaccine rollout is comparable to the U.S.’s, with others far behind. In those places, the race between vaccinations and variants is more fraught. In the developing world, the situation is dire.<br />Then there is the sheer amount of government support that has been pumped into the economy. The three rounds of Covid-19 relief that have been passed by Congress since last spring come to $5 trillion—an amount equal to nearly a quarter of U.S. gross domestic product. Beyond helping alleviate the economic strains of the pandemic, that has left many Americans with ample savings to spend as the pandemic passes. Most other countries haven’t provided nearly as much fiscal support in response to the crisis.<br />The U.S. vaccine rollout and fiscal response have prompted economists to raise their forecasts. Recent estimates from the International Monetary Fund, for example, project that U.S. GDP will be 6.3% higher in the fourth quarter than a year earlier. That is up from the IMF’s earlier forecast of 3.2% released in October. In contrast, the IMF trimmed its GDP estimates for the euro area.</td>

      <td>U.S. stock futures slipped Monday, signaling a muted opening for major indexes that stand at record highs ahead of a busy week of corporate earnings and economic data.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 edged down 0.2% after the benchmark stocks gauge posted its 20th all-time closing high of 2021 on Friday. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which also closed out last week at a record, ticked down 0.2%. Futures for the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 index slid nearly 0.2%.<br />Shares of technology giants have taken back control of the rally in U.S. stocks over the past month, helping to push major indexes to a series of all-time highs. Investors’ concerns about owning shares that are sensitive to rising interest rates have been assuaged by a retreat in yields on U.S. government bonds. Some say the shift into economically-sensitive sectors went too far at a time when major economies like the European Union and India are grappling with fresh coronavirus outbreaks.<br />Investors on Monday said they were positioning for the start of earnings season, as well as data that will help to gauge whether a coming burst of inflation will prove transitory. Inflation data due on Tuesday are expected to show consumer prices picked up in March.<br />“All of these things need to deliver in quite a Goldilocks manner for the current gains to remain intact,” said Edward Park, chief investment officer at U.K. investment firm Brooks Macdonald. There is “a bit of a question mark in markets just saying: We’re seeing strong gains; is this quite right?” Mr. Park said.</td>

The initiatives will cut further into profitability for the company, which said it would use existing liquidity to pay a $2.8 billion fine announced Saturday.<br />China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said an investigation into Alibaba found that it punished certain merchants who sold goods both on Alibaba and on rival platforms, a practice dubbed “er xuan yi”—literally, “choose one out of two.”<br />Alibaba shares, which had lost about a quarter of their value since November, jumped as much as 9% in early trading on Monday morning in Hong Kong before easing slightly to stand about 6% higher, in a sign that investors welcomed the clarity over the company’s future after fines were announced.<br />However, the antitrust investigation outcome raised concerns among analysts about how the company would retain merchants, particularly in an increasingly competitive e-commerce landscape with rivals including  JD.com Inc.  and  Pinduoduo Inc.</td>

Mr. Fuentes Caña says that since he arrived in Matamoros in May 2019, he’s been kidnapped several times and released only after paying the cartels a ransom. Corrupt officials and criminals extort migrants every chance they get, he says, and the cartels also pressure migrants to pay up for a coyote and enter the U.S. illegally: “Imagine: Who doesn’t pay, doesn’t last. You never see them again.”<br />Mr. Fuentes Caña finally found refuge at a seminary turned shelter in Matamoros, supported by Texan Christians. It’s one of dozens that have sprung up on both sides of the border to help with the unfolding humanitarian crisis. These makeshift shelters provide migrants with food, a bed, showers—and a modicum of protection against the corrupt officials, cartels and criminals who are making a fortune exploiting those fleeing persecution or seeking a better life in America. To the benefit of migrants, many of these rogues get superstitious about meddling with churches and their ministries.<br />President Biden is phasing out the Migrant Protection Protocols and gradually admitting asylum seekers who enrolled in the program. Mr. Fuentes Caña is still waiting for his turn to enter the U.S. legally, and he’s determined to abide by the law because he wants to reunite someday with his wife and five children, whom he left behind in Cuba. But the pastors I interviewed said other migrants misinterpreted Mr. Biden’s policy as a sign that the U.S. border is now open to them.</td>

      <td>The progressive goal is a House-like body run by big-state majorities.</td>
      <td>Between the drive to eliminate the legislative filibuster and the campaign to add new states for partisan advantage, the U.S. Senate hasn’t been under this much political pressure since the passage of the 17th Amendment (on the direct election of Senators) in 1913. The enduring influence and legitimacy of America’s legislative upper house has long distinguished the U.S. from many less stable democracies. But a new majoritarian ideology threatens to upend that achievement.<br />As early as this week a House committee will advance a partisan and constitutionally suspect bill to add Senators by making Washington, D.C., the 51st state. The Senate’s traditional 60-vote requirement to pass legislation hangs by a thread. A great deal has been written about the merits of both issues, but it’s wrong to see them in isolation. They are political manifestations of a fundamental challenge to the Senate as an institution that is worth understanding—and repudiating—in its own right.<br />Debate over the Senate’s structure—two Senators for each state, regardless of population—is as old as the nation. At the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, delegates from the larger states, especially in the South, wanted Senate seats apportioned according to population. They were outvoted, as smaller states like New Jersey didn’t want to forfeit their influence in the new federal government the Constitution created. The large states’ size would be reflected in the House of Representatives. This Great Compromise was essential to the Constitution’s ratification.<br />The design became a part of America’s civil religion. As James Madison (a large-stater at the convention) wrote in the Federalist, equal state representation in the Senate would guard “against an improper consolidation of the States into one simple republic.” The ability of states like Florida and New York, or Wyoming and Delaware, to pursue different policies remains a vital outlet for America’s national partisan divisions.<br />Yet today, like so many other features of the Constitution, the Senate’s equal weighting of states finds itself under siege in the press and academy. “Minority rule” has become a buzzword among pundits calling for smashing the filibuster and expanding the Senate.</td>

      <td>Producer prices rise 1% in March as supply-side constraints bite.</td>
      <td>Congratulations to those who want higher inflation. You’ve got it. The U.S. on Friday reported a rise of 1% in producer prices for March, double the consensus prediction of economists. Prices are up 4.2% in the last year, with goods prices up 7%.<br />The year-over-year increase is higher in part because of low, pandemic-induced numbers from 2020. The recent acceleration is also related to constraints on the supply of goods, while demand surges as the pandemic eases and consumers spend their pent-up savings and government checks.<br />For these reasons, Federal Reserve economists say inflation will be “transitory,” receding later this year as supply constraints ease. Let’s hope they’re right. But the Fed may also be underestimating the impact of its wide-open monetary policies despite an economy that will boom as the pandemic lockdowns end and the jobless rate continues to fall at a rapid rate.<br />The yield on the 10-year Treasury note popped to 1.66% on Friday, though down from its peak for the day. Investors will be watching Tuesday’s report on consumer prices for more inflation clues. The U.S. has never before pursued government-spending and monetary expansion of this magnitude with a hot economy, and the Fed says it will wait for durable inflation to appear before changing. Good luck.</td>

      <td>A new report shows how the prolonged school shutdown has hurt kids.</td>
      <td>Americans are only beginning to understand the damage from keeping so many students out of the classroom for the past year. It’s the greatest outrage of the pandemic, and maybe the most destructive. A new report by the nonprofit Great Public Schools Now quantifies the harm so far to children in the Los Angeles Unified School District.<br />L.A. schools will finally begin opening this week after more than a year of distance learning, though educational offerings will still be far from normal. Despite overwhelming evidence that it is safe for children to attend class in-person, the teachers union has long resisted a return to the classroom and issued over-the-top demands. Throughout the fall 2020 semester, the report notes, elementary-school students in L.A. received fewer than two hours a day of synchronous instruction on average—less than half as much as in the Long Beach and San Diego school districts.<br />The L.A. district considers students engaged merely for logging on to the online teaching platform. Yet even by this low standard, the Great Public Schools Now report finds that “over 13,000 middle and high school students were consistently disengaged in fall 2020,” and “an additional 56,000 did not actively participate on a daily basis.” In January and February, some 22,800 students missed three or more days of class a week.<br />During the 2020-2021 school year, 37% of Los Angeles kindergartners exhibited basic literacy skills, compared to 57% a year before. A fall 2020 assessment showed that only one in three middle- and high-school students displayed grade-level reading and math skills.<br />The learning losses are especially acute among poor and minority students. The report raises alarms about “a surge in the percentage of students receiving Ds and Fs in fall 2020, with students of color and students from low-income houses experiencing the highest number of failing grades.”</td>

Messrs. Chenault and Frazier cautioned businesses against dropping the issue and asked CEOs to sign a statement opposing what they view as discriminatory legislation on voting, the people said.<br />A statement could come early this week, the people said, and would build on one that 72 Black executives signed last month in the wake of changes to Georgia’s voting laws. Mr. Chenault told executives on the call that several leaders had signaled they would sign on, including executives at  PepsiCo Inc.,   PayPal  Holdings Inc.,  T. Rowe Price Group Inc.  and  Hess Corp. , among others, according to the people. PayPal confirmed it has signed the statement. PepsiCo, T. Rowe Price and Hess didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.<br />As more companies and their leaders have spoken out on the issue in recent weeks, their stands have drawn the ire of Republican state and federal legislators who say companies are miscasting the matter and shouldn’t act as shadow lawmakers. Meanwhile, progressive activists and others who oppose the laws have said that the actions leaders are taking aren’t strong enough. Many CEOs now feel a duty, or pressure, to make their views explicitly known to employees and others, executive advisers said.<br />Plenty of companies remain wary of wading into politically charged areas. One executive from a Fortune 100 consumer-products company said board members, employees and vendors are pressing leaders to speak out, but doing so could put a bull’s-eye on the company.</td>

      <td>The idea of a “vaccine passport,” which would let people prove they’re inoculated against Covid, has been swept up in a political debate over personal liberty. But this misunderstands how these apps are likely to be used. Passports would empower consumers by giving them more control over their own health information.<br />Millions of Americans now have index cards noting their vaccine lots and dates. But your doctor and health plan don’t necessarily have that information. The card could get lost and is easy to forge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requires states to maintain databases as a condition of vaccine shipments. But there are more than 60 separate systems—some large states like Texas have a few, and New York City has its own. The record system uses an existing arrangement for childhood-vaccination programs: It was set up years ago so pediatricians can ask these sites for records that a child has been vaccinated.<br />The federal government needed to set up a record system quickly, before the country could reach a consensus about how consumers should store this information. Instead, states were asked to work off of the existing system with no obvious plan for consumer access; the priority was getting shots in arms.<br />In some cases, health plans are notified that you have received a vaccine, at least if you volunteer your insurance card when vaccinated. But that doesn’t help the millions who are uninsured or get the shot at a mass vaccination site or other nonstandard place like an optometrist’s office.<br />As a result, there’s no easy way to prove you’ve been vaccinated. You’d need cryptographically signed data that can’t easily be forged—a digital card that enables you to retrieve and store testing and vaccination information in a secure and verifiable way, via either an app or a QR code.</td>

      <td>It prevented Southern senators from blocking debate and created the conditions for consensus.</td>
      <td>The debate over the future of the Senate’s legislative filibuster has focused on the simple use of majority power to crush the opposition. While the future of America’s bicameral legislature and the balance of power created by the Founders is riding on this debate, many have lost sight of the true nature and value of the Senate, an institution that takes time and requires compromise to find long-term answers to major issues. Critics have linked the filibuster to Jim Crow segregation, but the tactic actually played a crucial role in passing civil-rights legislation and ensuring it was accepted by the South.<br />Rule 22, which establishes a procedure called “cloture” to end a filibuster, was created to provide a way to close debate with support of a supermajority in the Senate and move to pass legislation. The rule protected the minority’s rights while allowing a compromise to be achieved that would ultimately result in legislation being passed.<br />For the first 47 years after Rule 22’s enactment in 1917, there were only five successful attempts to cut off debate in the U.S. Senate. A few senators felt so strongly about their right to extended debate that they vowed never to vote for cloture, even for legislation they supported.<br />There were several successful filibusters of civil-rights legislation between 1917 and 1964. But after President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, President Lyndon B. Johnson decided to make the Civil Rights Act his chief legislative priority. He worked with Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Minority Leader Everett Dirksen to maneuver the bill through the challenges of senators who planned to filibuster.<br />It began with Mansfield meeting with Georgia Democrat Richard Russell, the leader of the senators opposed to the Civil Rights Act. Mansfield promised there would be no tricks and he would keep Russell fully informed of Mansfield’s actions as he guided the bill through floor debate. Some insisted the bill should be driven through and passed as quickly as possible, but Mansfield treated every senator equally and fairly. He believed legislation should be addressed “not in the seeking of short-cuts, not in the cracking of nonexistent whips, not in wheeling and dealing, but in an honest facing of the situation and a resolution of it by the Senate itself.”</td>

It’s part of a desperate attempt to silence international scrutiny of Beijing’s abysmal human-rights record, particularly its genocidal policies against the Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang and its persecution of other religious minorities.<br />We won’t be intimidated or silenced. We appreciate Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s support, and we are proud that USCIRF has long been at the forefront in exposing the Communist Party’s egregious religious-freedom violations. In fact, we’re flattered by the Chinese government’s recognition for our work in defending religious freedom in China, as we join an increasing list of courageous American, European and other officials on whom the party has likewise applied sanctions for standing up to a regime that has violated its obligations under the Genocide Convention.<br />Meanwhile, Beijing’s threats gave us a glimpse into the state-led oppression under which so many Uighurs, Tibetans, Christians, Falun Gong practitioners and others are forced to live.<br />Given the Communist Party’s oppression at home and increasing aggression abroad, we must continue to stand with our partners to expose, condemn and hold the Chinese government accountable. Beijing’s belligerent rhetoric and actions demonstrate that international criticism and scrutiny of its human-rights record are effective. Genocide and crimes against humanity are deeply damaging to China’s image and undermine its ambition to project itself as a global power.<br />The Communist’s Party’s hostile actions are also counterproductive. They’re helping solidify a coalition of governments to counter such aggression. In this regard, this international coalition should take several immediate actions. Congress should pass the Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which creates a “rebuttable presumption” that bans all goods exported from Xinjiang. The U.S. government and like-minded partners should continue to impose targeted sanctions on Chinese agencies and officials responsible for severe violations of religious freedom and human rights.</td>

      <td>The study of human behavior has led to real insights but also, too often, to simplistic, reductive ‘solutions’ to complex problems.</td>
      <td>Most of us like to think of ourselves as enlightened, thoughtful observers of the world around us, skeptical of irrational claims, crazy ideas and silly theories. It is only other people, members of eccentric subcultures in far-off places, who are susceptible to such foolishness. It is a flattering self-portrait. But is it true?<br />In “The Quick Fix: Why Fad Psychology Can’t Cure Our Social Ills,” Jesse Singal, a contributing writer at New York magazine, chronicles several dubious enthusiasms that permeate our culture. Along the way, he tries to show why they are so widespread. His focus is on “the allure of fad psychology,” as he puts it, and on the ways in which “both individuals and institutions can do a better job of resisting it.”<br />We all remember the self-esteem programs that beguiled grade-school educators in the 1980s and 1990s. The idea was that, by handing out more prizes and encouraging self-affirming rhetoric, young people would do better in their studies and in life generally. But, as Mr. Singal notes, self-esteem failed to “ ‘unlock the gates’ of success.” Nor did it help to reduce—as promised—crime, teen pregnancy and a host of other social ills.<br />Then there was power-posing for women in the workplace: the claim that, by adopting assertive positions (legs astride, hands on hips) for two minutes before, say, going into a job interview, or while giving a presentation, a new confidence will be engendered as well as an improved status among otherwise dismissive men. A TED talk by an originator of power-posing and its chief evangelist, a Harvard psychologist, garnered 61 million views. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook was a fan. But it turned out that standing like Wonder Woman didn’t give women the promised testosterone boost and confidence they sought.<br />A MacArthur Fellowship-winning social psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania championed a mental trait called “grit” (aka stick-to-itiveness). Teaching “grit” became a wildly popular way to build character or boost grades in school-aged children across the country. It didn’t deliver. As Mr. Singal notes, established concepts such as conscientiousness and IQ were far better at predicting performance.</td>

In Washington, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council declined to comment.<br />Iran and the remaining five parties to the 2015 nuclear accord converged in Vienna last week to negotiate a road map for the U.S. to return to the agreement, which the Trump administration left in 2018. Their objective is to find a way for President Biden’s administration to lift sanctions on Iran if Tehran agrees to comply with the 2015 pact, which was developed to curtail the growth of Iran’s nuclear capability, and keep it from developing nuclear-weapons technology.</td>

Similar to the exports, the country’s import sector is expected to see 25% growth in March, reversing a year-earlier decline of 0.9%.<br />U.S. consumer prices are expected to pick up in March, a potential signal of building inflation pressures amid a big dose of fiscal stimulus, rising consumer spending and supply-chain bottlenecks. Most policy makers and many economists, however, are forecasting that relatively strong consumer-price gains will be short-lived.<br />Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks virtually to the Economic Club of Washington.

Mr. Biden said last week he planned to meet with Republicans, beginning Monday, in an effort to see where common ground can be found. But Democratic leaders have also made clear they will be willing to move forward without GOP support and tap a process tied to the budget known as reconciliation, as they did earlier this year on a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.<br />“We hope to do this in the most bipartisan way possible,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) told reporters Thursday. “If we have to go to reconciliation, that’s a lever, but I hope it’s not something that we need to do.”<br />Bills using reconciliation in the Senate can advance with just a simple majority, rather than 60 votes.<br />Mr. Biden has said he wants the package to be bipartisan, while also keeping the door open to passing the bill on party lines. But some Democrats have also aired disagreements over the size and makeup of the proposal, meaning party leaders face a challenge keeping the rank and file in line.</td>

      <td>This heavily time-limited passport is a temporary incentive rewarding responsible behavior and ensuring fairness by preventing some from free-riding on the immunity of others.</td>
      <td>Regarding Martin Kulldorff and Jay Bhattacharya’s “Vaccine Passports Prolong Lockdowns” (op-ed, April 7): The authors’ idea is that the passport (valid at the most for six months without a booster shot) is a punishment scheme to deter bad behavior and will lead to a mad rush that will, perhaps unfairly, trample on the truly vulnerable. However, is it not possible for the opposite to be true, that is, this heavily time-limited passport is a temporary incentive rewarding responsible behavior and ensuring fairness by preventing some from free-riding on the immunity of others?<br />Prof. Subimal Chatterjee<br />Binghamton University, SUNY<br />Binghamton, N.Y.<br /></td>

      <td>If Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was an executive in the private sector, her attempt to collude on international corporate tax rates would likely lead to charges of conspiracy to fix prices.</td>
      <td>As long as there are corporate taxes there will be arguments about what is fair, competitive and how to avoid a “race to the bottom” (“U.S. Aims for Global Minimum Corporate Tax Rate,” Page One, April 6). Alas, there is a simple solution: Set the rate at zero.<br />Corporate taxes support only about 10% of federal receipts, a figure that could be easily covered by raising other taxes. Economists already debate whether corporations truly pay taxes or merely pass them along in an inefficient and, yes, unfair, manner. Clever ploys such as domicile shifting and inversions will be relegated to the scrapheap of corporate history. And if none of this works, well, deficit spending is all the rage anyway; there isn’t the slightest pretense of fiscal discipline anywhere near our nation’s capital.<br />John Carlson<br />Boulder, Colo.<br />The Biden administration’s call for a global minimum corporate tax rate is an American initiative to suppress economic competition among nations. Bottom line, it’s based on the notion that people in government are wise and government structures and bureaucracies are efficient. Who believes that?</td>

      <td>Fed chairman says employment, economic output are about to start growing ‘much more quickly’</td>
      <td>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy appears to be at an inflection point, with output and job growth poised to accelerate in the months ahead as long as the Covid-19 pandemic retreats.<br />“We feel like we’re at a place where the economy’s about to start growing much more quickly and job creation coming much more quickly,” Mr. Powell said in an excerpt of an interview set to air in full Sunday evening on CBS’s “60 Minutes.”<br />Saying a resurgence of Covid-19 remains the primary risk to the economic outlook, the central-bank chief urged Americans to continue socially distancing and wearing masks.<br />President Biden and administration officials have also urged Americans to be patient and take precautions as the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines continues and new variants spread.<br />Fed officials and private forecasters say the U.S. economy is positioned for its fastest year of growth since the early 1980s. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal in recent days said they expect economic output to expand 6.4% in 2021 and private-sector payrolls to rise by 7.06 million.</td>
