      <td>Apple Inc.  has threatened to ban Parler, a free-speech focused social-media network favored by conservatives, for failing to moderate incitements to violence and illegal activity, according to a notice provided to The Wall Street Journal by John Matze, Parler’s chief executive.<br />“We have received numerous complaints regarding objectionable content in your Parler service, accusations that the Parler App was used to plan, coordinate and facilitate the illegal activities in Washington DC on January 6,” the notice begins. The tech giant said in order for Parler to remain available in the App Store, it had to provide detailed information on its content-moderation plans and “what you will do to improve moderation and content filtering your service for this kind of objectionable content going forward.”<br />Apple set a deadline of 24 hours for Parler’s compliance.<br />Launched in 2018, Parler has billed itself as a free-speech friendly and content-recommendation free alternative to larger social networks such as  Facebook  and  Twitter .  It has exploded in popularity in the run-up to and after the 2020 U.S. presidential election<br />While Parler bans spam, threats of violence and other illegal activity, its rules don’t prohibit hate speech and false information.</td>

      <td>The economy is poised for a boom in 2021 after a December setback.</td>
      <td>Equity markets took in stride Friday’s labor report showing 140,000 job losses in December, and that sounds right. The slump is the clear and unsurprising result of renewed state lockdowns amid the latest Covid-19 surge. But the economy looks poised for a boom in 2021, with another jobs acceleration, once vaccines roll out and the virus emergency subsides.<br />Leisure and hospitality accounted for the bulk of the job losses (498,000), as states such as Washington, Michigan and Pennsylvania banned indoor dining. California even barred restaurants from serving outdoors amid a broad lockdown that closed most personal services. New unemployment claims in California alone last month totalled more than 710,000.<br />Yet the jobless rate stayed at 6.7% as most lockdown losses were offset by strong job growth in such industries as manufacturing (38,000), construction (51,000) and even retail (120,500). Employment in residential construction grew by some 57,200 in 2020.<br />Employment is also up 172,100 year-over-year at big-box retailers like  Walmart ,   Costco  and  Target .  They’ve been growing fast to compete with  Amazon .  The pandemic shift to online commerce has created 223,200 new jobs in couriers and 103,500 in warehouses over the last year. Most new jobs tied to online commerce aren’t going away once the virus ebbs.<br />Payrolls were also revised up 135,000 for October and November, which underscores the strong job growth before states tightened business restrictions. Permanent layoffs also fell 348,000 last month while temporary layoffs increased 277,000, which suggests plans to rehire workers once restrictions ease.</td>

      <td>The House Speaker publicizes her nuclear option to protect the world from Trump.</td>
      <td>We scoured the U.S. Constitution Friday afternoon and it’s definitely not there: the provision allowing the Speaker of the House of Representatives to intervene in the military chain of command to protect the world from President Trump.<br />Mrs. Pelosi told her Democratic colleagues that she spoke Friday morning to Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “to discuss available precautions for preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike.” She posted the “Dear colleague” letter on her website to make sure the world got the message. A spokesman for Gen. Milley told reporters the chairman “answered her questions.”<br />The press and left-wing  Twitter  (we repeat ourselves) love the idea of the Speaker inserting herself into the chain of command as a rebuke to an erratic President. But it’s an abuse of her own power, which is limited to leading the legislative branch unless both the President and Vice President are incapacitated or removed from office. In that case she is third in line for the Presidency.<br />But in the meantime she has no business telling the Joint Chiefs not to follow the President’s orders. Gen. Milley hardly needs the lecture, as he has been dealing with Mr. Trump for 15 months and isn’t about to indulge an unlawful order, much less an effort to launch nuclear weapons.<br />Mrs. Pelosi’s call to Gen. Milley is itself a violation of the separation of powers by seeking to inject herself into an executive-branch military decision. She can offer advice all she wants, but this call at this time has the sound of an order. It might even be construed by some as its own little coup—conniving with the military to relieve of command the person who remains the elected President.</td>

      <td>China taunts the world as it arrests the entire democratic opposition.</td>
      <td>With the tumult in America this week, readers may have missed the ominous news from Hong Kong, where police arrested more than 50 former lawmakers and dissenters on Wednesday. The list includes one American, and the roundup is an early test for the Biden Administration.<br />The prisoners were arrested for their roles as candidates or organizers of a pro-democracy primary election last July. Some 600,000 Hong Kongers voted in the primary, which isn’t part of the formal political process but which would have determined who challenged pro-Beijing candidates in the 2020 Legislative Council elections. The Communist Party fears an electoral humiliation after pro-democracy district council candidates won in a landslide in the November 2019 election.<br />Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, Beijing’s agent, warned last July that if the pro-democracy camp tried to gain Legislative Council seats to resist Beijing’s agenda, that “may fall into the category of subverting state power.” Authorities later postponed the legislative elections, and the arrests make clear that now even campaigning as a pro-democracy candidate is a crime under China’s new national-security law. This is what Russia has done with opposition candidate Alexei Navalny.<br />The arrested include Benny Tai, who helped with the logistics of the primary; former lawmaker Alvin Yeung, an outspoken defender of the independent judiciary; former legislator Claudia Mo; union organizer Carol Ng; and Jimmy Sham, who organized protests that turned out millions in 2019 and was attacked by thugs wielding hammers.<br />Also snatched was Hong Kong resident and American human-rights lawyer John Clancey, who served as treasurer for a pro-democracy political group. He and many of the others arrested this week have since been released on bail. Yet they could face re-imprisonment at any time, like media tycoon Jimmy Lai, whose bail was revoked last month and is behind bars awaiting trial over the 2019 protests. Under the new national-security law, the maximum sentence is life in prison. The arrests show that Hong Kong is now thoroughly under the Communist Party’s rule and any dissent will be punished.</td>

      <td>After raising tax rates, Gov. Murphy increases corporate welfare.</td>
      <td>Perhaps the biggest winners in the Georgia Senate runoffs are Democratic states banking on federal budget relief. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is already cashing his future check with $14 billion in new state business subsidies to mitigate his Covid-19 lockdown and corporate tax hike.<br />“Tax incentives should be used strategically and sparingly,” Mr. Murphy said in 2019. He added that “to those who bemoan our inability to pay for even the most basic items in our budget, let me say,” spending $1 billion a year on corporate subsidies “simply put, is nuts.” The Governor let the tax breaks lapse.<br />He’s now back to “nuts.” Legislation he signed Thursday provides $11.5 billion in tax breaks over seven years for real-estate projects as well as businesses that keep and create jobs in the state. Another $2.6 billion in tax credits are for film production.<br />Mr. Murphy says the tax breaks are needed to help businesses hurt by the pandemic—i.e., his excessive business shutdowns. New Jersey’s 10.2% unemployment rate in November was the highest in the country. But last year he extended the state’s “temporary” corporate tax hike and borrowed $4 billion to avoid spending cuts. Trenton Democrats in 2018 raised the state’s top corporate rate to 11.5% from 9% for businesses with more than $1 million in income. That gave New Jersey the highest rate in the country after Iowa (12%). The tax increase was supposed to fall to 10.5% last year and sunset after 2021, but Democrats, no surprise, extended the 11.5% rate through 2023.<br />Now Democrats are offering a salve to politically favored businesses, thus completing the cycle of political life in New Jersey: Make rich promises to public unions, increase taxes and borrowing to pay for them, and then spend to keep businesses and jobs from leaving. Revenues have improved in New Jersey since the spring, but the budget is still bleeding from unsustainable pension obligations.</td>

      <td>Go ahead and laugh. But if we’re such a joke state, why are all of your neighbors moving here?</td>
      <td>St. Petersburg, Fla.<br />Florida remains the Rodney Dangerfield of states, admired by some but derided by many. In his book “Best. State. Ever: A Florida Man Defends His Homeland,” Dave Barry laments that his adopted home is considered a “joke state.” But even Mr. Barry concedes that Florida, “because of its unique shape and warm climate, does have an unusually high percentage of low IQ people doing stupid things, frequently naked.” Last year, a study ranked Florida the country’s 28th smartest state. The headline in the Miami Herald was: “Florida is not the dumbest state in the union. Are you surprised?”<br />Florida may indeed be a kind of national punching bag, thanks in large part to the proliferation of crazy Florida Man stories that go viral. Since I moved here with my wife and two children in 2019, I regularly receive messages from friends from as far afield as Liechtenstein and Colombia alluding to Florida’s reputation as a generally idiotic place. During spring break, images of crowded Florida beaches, full of revelers—many of them out-of-towners—were plastered around the world as proof that Floridians are just a brain cell or two superior to sloths.<br />I got the feeling that many in the media and the population at large hoped that a calamity would befall us, so they could crow about how we got what we deserved. The pandemic has taken a toll here, but the per capita Covid-19 death rate in Florida is 23rd in the country, well behind strict lockdown states like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Illinois, Michigan and many others.<br />Florida is picked on reflexively, regardless of the situation, perhaps because bullies in the media are too dumb or unoriginal to vary their targets. When friends visit us, they are surprised to discover cities with character, like St. Augustine and St. Petersburg, because they’ve bought into the media narrative that Florida is nothing more than strip malls, subdivisions and brain-dead fools frying in the sun. Perhaps now is the time to reassess whether Florida deserves its status as the nation’s laughingstock.</td>

      <td>When it comes to denouncing or indicting inciters, there’s no reason to stop at Donald Trump.</td>
      <td>When white supremacists and counterprotesters descended on Charlottesville in 2017, police didn’t issue riot gear, close streets, or call immediately for state or federal backup. And it wasn’t because they weren’t forewarned or lacked intelligence on what was about to happen. Indeed, they had experienced a nearly identical situation with a KKK rally weeks before.<br />But in one way America isn’t a banana republic: Police will do almost anything to avoid firing into a crowd to interrupt lawbreaking or even risk the possibility. This also was true during the George Floyd protests, when police in New York flashed their lights and squawked on bullhorns but didn’t get out of their cars to stop store looters because it wasn’t worth risking lives to save a few $1,200 sweaters.<br />In the end, most of the invaders of the Capitol behaved more like tourists than insurrectionists, allowing themselves to be herded out when police had assembled a superior force. It could have been much worse but wasn’t because sense was prevalent on both sides.<br />A careful postmortem in Charlottesville showed that protesters are like your children: Each one is different. Political activists, gawkers and journalists show up as well as hatemongers of every description, drawn by a hope of mayhem and not overly observant of partisan narratives adopted for the convenience of the media. Was President Trump warned that threats to the Capitol had been circulating online for weeks? He should have been—in which case he might well worry about a charge of incitement.<br />If the storming of the Capitol finally inoculates voters against the worst tendencies of Trumpism, notice this goal was not vouchsafed by four years of Democrats and the media trying to counter Trump by emulating him, with false narratives and tortured or falsified evidence.</td>

Under our Constitution, it will be my duty as Vice President and as President of the Senate to serve as the presiding officer.<br />After an election with significant allegations of voting irregularities and numerous instances of officials setting aside state election law, I share the concerns of millions of Americans about the integrity of this election. The American people choose the American President, and have every right under the law to demand free and fair elections and a full investigation of electoral misconduct. As presiding officer, I will do my duty to ensure that these concerns receive a fair and open hearing in the Congress of the United States. Objections will be heard, evidence will be presented, and the elected representatives of the American people will make their decision.<br />Our Founders created the Electoral College in 1787, and it first convened in 1789. With the advent of political parties, the Electoral College was amended in 1804 to provide that Electors vote separately for President and Vice President. Following a contentious election in 1876, with widespread allegations of fraud and malfeasance, Congress spent a decade establishing rules and procedures to govern the counting of electoral votes and the resolution of any objections.<br />During the 130 years since the Electoral Count Act was passed, Congress has, without exception, used these formal procedures to count the electoral votes every four years.</td>

      <td>SÃO PAULO—Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration has backed down from its criticism of Chinese vaccines and agreed to buy up to 100 million doses of a shot being developed by China’s Sinovac, as Latin America confronts a postholiday surge in Covid-19 cases.<br />Mr. Bolsonaro, an ex-army captain who followed President Trump’s lead in bashing China, has long discredited Sinovac’s vaccine, which has been tested by a state research center in a partnership backed by his political rival, São Paulo Gov. João Doria. Only two months ago, Mr. Bolsonaro told his supporters the vaccine, CoronaVac, could kill or disable them, without offering evidence, and refused to buy it.<br />But over the past few months, the Chinese vaccine has emerged as one of Brazil’s best bets to fight a pandemic that has cost the lives of more than 200,000 people here, second only to the U.S.<br />The Health Ministry said late Thursday that it had signed a contract with the Butantan Institute, the São Paulo state research center that has been testing and producing CoronaVac, to buy 46 million doses. The ministry said it has the option to buy another 54 million, enough to immunize 50 million people with the two dose-shot, or about a quarter of Brazil’s population.<br />Latin America is racing to secure doses as cases surge across the region. Hundreds of thousands of more people tested positive in Latin America this week, after many defied government warnings and held big family gatherings over the holidays and packed beaches at the start of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer. With only 8% of the world’s population, Latin America has accounted for nearly 30% of Covid-19 deaths.</td>

      <td>Artist-explorer Albert Bierstadt’s “A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie” looms as large in American cultural history as the towering peaks he depicts.</td>
      <td>In mid-June 1863,the celebrated German-born American painter Albert Bierstadt ventured by wagon into the high Rocky Mountains west of Denver, scouting scenes for a Colorado painting. When he got to the area below the Chicago Lakes, he was “in raptures with the scenery,” according to his companion. Soon he unpacked his brushes and paints to make an oil sketch.<br />So began Bierstadt’s work on his majestic “A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie” (1866), a 7-by-12-foot magnum opus that is one of the most prized artworks in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. Created in the gloomy Civil War era, the painting conveys the grandeur of the American West at a time when the nation’s belief in Manifest Destiny roused hopes and dreams even for citizens who were not headed west. Studded with emblems of the frontier—a soaring eagle, a black bear, pristine lakes, big skies, steep cliffs and a Native American camp—“A Storm” is, in the words of art historian Linda Ferber, writing in the museum’s 2006 “American Paintings in the Brooklyn Museum: Artists Born by 1876,” “a pivotal work in American cultural history.”<br />Bierstadt (1830-1902), who relished the role of artist-explorer that was blazed in Latin America by his contemporary Frederic Edwin Church, was painting for people who had little knowledge of Western terrain. For this scene of untamed nature, he chose a dramatic moment, cloaking his landscape in three weather patterns—a threatening thunderstorm in the craggy, snowcapped mountains in the distance; dazzling sunshine on the lower mountains and a misty lake in the middle-ground; and a fertile grassland in the foreground, where Indians race with their horses toward their teepees, possibly in anticipation of the storm.<br />At work in the Tenth Street Studio Building in Manhattan, Bierstadt referred to many drawings and oil sketches he made on his 1863 travels. He painted details like the grasses, ferns, wildflowers and animals meticulously, as correct renditions of nature. But to make this bold, stirring landscape, he also embellished—exaggerating geological features or adjusting their placement, using rich colors, and brilliantly heightening light and shadow effects to magnify the theatricality of his work.<br />Perhaps the small Native American camp in the left foreground was Bierstadt’s biggest stretch. No writings from this trip, or his two others to the West, suggest that he actually came face-to-face with Indians. He simply decided to insert them, engaged in a hunt (notice the dead deer). This invention allowed Bierstadt to convey the grand scale of the Rockies and, more important, to give the painting a human narrative, albeit one that exoticizes and romanticizes the West. Bierstadt was careful to paint their gear, like a blanket and saddle, accurately, scholars say, but he makes no allusion to the U.S. government’s drive to force Native Americans off their lands.</td>

      <td>Then-Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen pressed ahead in December 2015 with the central bank’s first interest rate increase in nearly a decade despite several colleagues’ misgivings over global economic weakness and weak inflation pressures, according to transcripts of the policy meeting released Friday.<br />Ms. Yellen, who has been nominated by President-elect Joe Biden to serve as Treasury secretary, argued for raising short-term rates to slow hiring and pre-empt inflationary pressures that could require more aggressive rate increases later.<br />“We would want to check the pace of employment growth somewhat to reduce the risk of overheating that could eventually force us to tighten abruptly,” she said at the Dec. 16 meeting. The decision to lift interest rates from near zero after holding them there for seven years was approved unanimously by the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.<br />But Ms. Yellen allowed for the risk that inflation dynamics weren’t operating as they had in prior periods, which is what transpired. “A more radical rethinking…would surely be in order,” she said, if inflation remained “persistently subdued…despite further improvements in the labor market.”<br />The Fed publishes a written summary of its policy meetings after a three-week delay, but these minutes don’t include verbatim quotes or identify speakers by name. Transcripts of the discussions providing those details are released after more than five years. The Fed on Friday released the transcripts of all its 2015 FOMC meetings.</td>

Sicknick, was struck in the head with a fire extinguisher during Wednesday’s unrest, according to a law-enforcement official. After he was injured, he returned to his division office and collapsed, the Capitol Police said, and was taken to a local hospital. Mr. Sicknick, 42 years old, died of his injuries at 9:30 p.m. Thursday.<br />The Capitol Police said his death would be investigated by the homicide branch of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, the Capitol Police and federal investigators. Prosecutors are also exploring the possibility of federal charges in connection with the death.<br />The youngest of three sons born in South River, N.J., Mr. Sicknick had wanted to be a police officer his entire life, according to a statement from his family. He joined the New Jersey Air National Guard, deploying to Saudi Arabia in 1999 and Kyrgyzstan in 2003, according to the Guard.<br />“Many details regarding Wednesday’s events and the direct causes of Brian’s injuries remain unknown and our family asks the public and the press to respect our wishes in not making Brian’s passing a political issue,” the family said in a statement provided by Mr. Sicknick’s brother, Ken. “Brian is a hero and that is what we would like people to remember.”</td>

The number of such crossings has fallen since the huge surge of migrants entering Europe in 2015.<br />The global pandemic has pushed down migration, both legal and illegal, as countries have closed borders, restricted routes for legal migration and scaled back programs to take in refugees. Covid-19 travel restrictions inside countries and along borders have also made smuggling more dangerous and expensive, experts said, although it hasn’t halted the activity altogether.<br />In Europe, the year started out with a surge in crossings from Turkey to Greece—a route used by Middle Eastern migrants and refugees, notably from Syria—but those numbers ultimately fell.<br />In February, the Turkish government signaled that it would no longer abide by a 2016 agreement it struck with the EU to stop large-scale migration.

      <td>Rising infections and new, highly contagious strains of the coronavirus are pressuring governments to accelerate vaccinations</td>
      <td>Countries around the world are accelerating their efforts to vaccinate their populations against Covid-19 in response to rising infections, public pressure, and fear of new, highly contagious variants of the coronavirus.<br />In an emerging race between the virus and vaccinations, some countries that previously took a cautious approach to authorizing and procuring vaccines, such as South Korea and Australia, are now bringing forward their timetables. Some other countries that were already pushing to inoculate swaths of their population quickly, such as the U.K. and Israel, are looking to further speed up their rollouts.<br />A year into the pandemic, the growing urgency behind vaccination programs shows how most of the world is still struggling to contain the virus with social-distancing measures alone. Stubbornly high infections, pressure on hospitals, public weariness with restrictions on everyday life and fear of accumulating economic damage are prompting many governments to hasten their vaccination plans. But in much of the world, ambitious timetables face obstacles including a shortage of available vaccine doses, logistical challenges and mixed levels of public willingness to get inoculated.<br />South Korea and Australia have brought forward the launch of their vaccination programs to February, about a month earlier than planned, in response to fresh outbreaks and concerns about the economic impact of rising contagion. Both countries were confident until recently they had tamed Covid-19 and therefore could afford to take time to authorize and distribute the new vaccines.<br />South Korea, seen as a model of how to limit contagion, took a particularly cautious approach to new vaccines last year, citing potential side effects and arguing that time was needed to negotiate better prices with pharmaceutical companies. After  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech  SE said in November their vaccine was 95% effective, South Korea’s health minister expressed surprise Pfizer had asked if the country wanted to place an order. It didn’t for weeks.</td>

      <td>From the 2020 primaries to the post-election furor, the founders’ system of election by states proved its democratic value.</td>
      <td>Scholars, pundits and progressives widely despise the Electoral College. They think it antiquated, irrational and undemocratic and argue for scrapping it in favor of a national popular vote.<br />But in 2020, when many hallowed American institutions submitted to street demonstrations and violence, the Electoral College proved a steadfast guardian of democracy. It can’t solve our problems on its own, but has given us a measure of stability to try for ourselves. A national popular election in 2020 would have made our problems immeasurably worse.<br />The essential feature of the Electoral College is voting for president by states. Each state has electoral votes equal to its delegation in the U.S. Congress—representatives (one for Vermont, 14 for Michigan, 53 for California, etc.) plus two senators. State legislatures determine the “manner” of casting their electoral votes, and 48 of them allocate those votes on a winner-take-all basis to the national ticket that receives the highest state popular vote. Maine and Nebraska select two electors by statewide vote and the remainder by congressional district.<br />As part of this design, states manage presidential elections along with those for other offices. They establish standards and procedures for voter eligibility, candidate ballot listing, mail-in voting, vote counting, challenges and recounts. The Constitution sets Inauguration Day as Jan. 20; federal statutes set a uniform Election Day in early November and a careful sequence of intermediate dates—for states to certify their election results and cast their electoral votes in December, and for their receipt by a joint session of Congress Jan. 6. To be elected president, a candidate must receive a majority of the electoral votes—at least 270 of the total 538.<br />Electoral votes are cast individually by electors, who gather in their state capitals in December. The Constitution’s framers conceived of electors as intermediaries between voters and candidates, but political parties soon assumed this role, choosing party stalwarts as electors pledged to their candidates. That has made the Electoral College assemblies largely ceremonial (there have been occasional “faithless electors,” but states can replace or penalize them). Still, newspapers ran many stories about electors who trekked to their state capitals to cast their votes on Dec. 14—diligently engaged in a constitutional practice that runs back to the election of George Washington in 1789.</td>

      <td>After nearly a year of vacation deprivation, frustrated globe-trotters are starting to dream about traveling freely again. We highlight six getaway goals for 2021 and new ways to realize each one.</td>
      <td>LINDA LAU IS looking forward to being jet-lagged as hell, sipping soju and dining at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Seoul with a bunch of strangers. This October, she hopes to attend the kickoff dinner of a “culinary retreat” to South Korea that she was supposed to take in fall 2020—that is, before the pandemic stopped travel cold. The rollout of Covid vaccines is giving her—and many of us—confidence to begin planning trips again. In a survey conducted in December 2020 by research firm Destination Analysts, over 53% of U.S. respondents said the vaccine made them optimistic that they can travel safely within the next six months; more than 80% said they have “at least tentative” plans right now.<br />Getting vaccinated, however, shouldn’t be seen as an immediate passport back to our former easygoing travel habits, cautions Dr. Lin Chen, president of the International Society of Travel Medicine and director of the Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. “There’s a little bit of data that suggests we may have reduced ability to transmit or carry” the virus, post vaccination, said Dr. Chen, “but it’s not enough.” More encouraging data may emerge, but, for now, even vaccinated travelers who hit the road before herd immunity is achieved—which Dr. Chen hopes might happen by fall in some regions—should continue to take precautions. That means wearing masks, distancing and observing other safety measures to protect the unvaccinated and the vulnerable.<br />Still, planning abounds. Troy Haas, president and CEO of Birmingham, Ala.-based Brownell Travel, sees people making travel arrangements as a form of self-care. “People just want the ability to find small ways to draw some joy back into life with travel and human connection,” he said. “Travel is a drink of water in a parched life.”<br />Here, we present six typical goals this year—from planning a getaway with the extended family to fleeing the pod for some overdue time alone—plus a few suggestions on how to achieve them. And since the international travel landscape could change dramatically in the coming months, we also offer a few domestic travel options. Even if you’re not ready to commit to vacation plans just yet, the following should help quench some of that travel thirst.<br />The Goal Zoom calls with the extended family are growing tiresome. Your first priority is getting the whole gang back together in the flesh.</td>

      <td>The ratification debates of 1787-88 were colored by ‘patriotic enthusiasms’ verging on violent chaos.</td>
      <td>What should statesmen do when public passions go awry? On Jan. 6, pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol, breaking windows, interrupting the certification of the 2020 election results, and forcing the evacuation of lawmakers. The chaotic scene turned tragic when one person was shot and killed in the melee. This was unquestionably an example of unhinged enthusiasm, of passions run amok.<br />Immanuel Kant once remarked that nothing great has ever been done without passion. But passion, when improperly managed, can do great harm. During the debates over the ratification of the Constitution in 1787-88, the Federalists sought to manage public enthusiasm by enlisting passion on the side of reason. They did so to unify the nation. And we can learn from them.<br />Americans like to think that the writing and ratification of the Constitution consisted of calm reflection and choice. But the ratification debates were, as the scholar Michael Faber recently put it, a “knock-down, drag-out fight.”<br />Elbridge Gerry, a delegate at the Federal Convention who refused to sign the Constitution, was burned in effigy in Massachusetts. George Mason of Virginia, who also withheld his signature, was encouraged by the mayor of Alexandria to leave town shortly after his arrival, given the great threat to his personal safety. Mobs forced Anti-Federalists in Pennsylvania to return to the state Assembly and hurriedly set a date for the state’s ratifying convention.<br />The Anti-Federalist Richard Henry Lee wrote to Samuel Adams, expressing disappointment that “the Agitators of this new system” were resorting to mob violence to rush the ratification of the Constitution, “as if the subject of Government were a business of passion, instead of cool, sober, and intense consideration.”</td>

Then, cold December weather triggered another big increase in joblessness.<br />December’s 140,000 drop in payrolls was the first since April. But unlike in April, December’s job losses were concentrated in the leisure and hospitality industries, said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at job site ZipRecruiter.</td>

      <td>At 84, the British artist surveys his career as a satirist and ‘Gonzo’ partner of writer Hunter S. Thompson.</td>
      <td>The British illustrator Ralph Steadman often begins a picture with a splat of ink on a white page. “It’s a very positive way of making a mark,” he says. “I can spread ink out easier than I can oil, and I can splash and blot, which I like to do.” Mr. Steadman’s spontaneous and satirical approach to caricature found a perfect corollary in the raucous prose of the American journalist Hunter S. Thompson. Together, artist and writer produced a body of work in magazine articles and books that became known as “Gonzo” for its unhinged subjectivity and anti-authoritarian outlook.<br />Mr. Steadman’s famed illustrations for “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,” Thompson’s autobiographical 1971 novel about his drug-fueled adventures, are a mixture of grotesque portraiture and geometrically precise landscape. A car driven by two screaming lunatics careens across a desert consisting of horizontal lines and a few felt-tip cactuses. In the distance, the looming skyscrapers that herald their Las Vegas destination are depicted by dozens of tightly packed vertical lines of differing lengths.<br />Now 84, Mr. Steadman, looks back on his career as a cartoonist in “A Life In Ink,” an illustrated memoir published by Chronicle Chroma in November. He credits the precision of his draughtsmanship to his time as an apprentice aircraft engineer in the 1950s. “I had to do endless circles and straight lines and that’s where that comes from in my illustrations,” he says. He still favors the same kind of steel-nibbed pens dipped into an inkpot that he used then.<br />Artistically, Mr. Steadman says that one of his most enduring influences is the Surrealist Marcel Duchamp. “It was his thinking out of context that interested me,” he says. “What I liked was Duchamp’s rather bland but comic sensibility, like taking a stool and attaching a bicycle wheel to the top of it.” In “A Life in Ink,” he attributes a different kind of influence to the headmaster of the school that he attended while growing up in Wales, “a hideous monster of a man that carried a cane” and left Mr. Steadman with an abiding mistrust of authority figures.<br />The young artist sold his first cartoon to the Manchester Evening Chronicle in 1956 and was soon being published in British humor magazines such as Punch and Private Eye. In 1969, the first book collection of his work, “Still Life with Raspberry,” launched his career in the U.S. He first collaborated with Thompson in 1970, when the two covered the Kentucky Derby for a short-lived magazine, Scanlan’s Monthly.</td>

      <td>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) is threatening impeachment again. But as with her last Trump impeachment, she faces a challenge in defining the charges.<br />At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, President Trump said in a Thursday night video that “like all Americans I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem” at the Capitol this week. He said to those who broke the law, “You will pay.” He also called for “healing and reconciliation”  and promised an orderly transition. But this morning Mr. Trump missed yet another opportunity to make the transition a gracious one. Mr. Trump tweeted:<br />Meanwhile on Thursday President-elect Joe Biden also was not in a mood for reconciliation and healing. In a litany of complaints about the current President, Mr. Biden bizarrely included a claim that Mr. Trump had been unreasonable to criticize the intelligence community—the same intelligence community that helped cast a yearslong cloud over his presidency by including with an official intelligence assessment the bogus Steele dossier of Trump-Russia accusations funded by the Clinton campaign. Said Mr. Biden:<br />Dared to tell the truth?

      <td>His firm applies an edible, plant-based coating to fruits and vegetables that lets them last longer without refrigeration</td>
      <td>Growing up in Battle Ground, Wash., James Rogers wanted to be an inventor. He spent weekends at the local hardware store sorting through buckets of odds and ends, moved by the idea that he could use ordinary materials to make something new. “I didn’t know then that that was science,” he says over Zoom from his home in Santa Barbara, Calif.<br />Some 25 years since those afternoons with his “invention journal,” Mr. Rogers, 35, is now promoting a scientific discovery that could improve the global food-supply chain. His company, Apeel, applies an edible, plant-based coating to fruits and vegetables that extends their shelf life without refrigeration.<br />Apeel-treated avocados, limes, apples and cucumbers are already in some of the largest grocery chains in the U.S. and Europe. The startup now plans to expand into markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America, thanks to a $30 million investment from the International Finance Corp., the World Bank’s private-sector arm. The company Mr. Rogers launched in 2012 as a Ph.D. student is now valued at more than $1 billion.<br />“Perishability governs every element of the food system,” Mr. Rogers says. Fruits and vegetables start to lose their value once they are picked, and producers, suppliers, retailers and consumers all race to get those berries and leaves into someone’s mouth before they spoil.<br />This urgency forces trade-offs. Most retailers arrange produce in unrefrigerated displays, which sells food faster but ensures that everything rots sooner. Asparagus turns so quickly that most international imports come by air, which gives these tender spears a larger carbon footprint than pork or veal, according to a study in the Journal of Industrial Ecology.</td>

I did this because my present stock of T-shirts was getting faded and raggedy—but also because I am trying to support the retail sector of this country in its hour of need.<br />For reasons that are not clear, my local department stores did not have the black T-shirts in stock, only the white ones. Eventually I hit on the obvious solution and decided to order the shirts online, directly from the manufacturer. But at some point in the payment process, I made the fatal decision to surrender my email address, so that the manufacturer could alert me to massive discounts and flash sales.<br />At first, even the manufacturer did not have the size or color I wanted, so I put the whole project aside. In a few hours, I received a message basically asking “Did you forget something?” Just in that short time, my size and color had come in, so I ordered a half-dozen. The price was not great, nor was the shipping, but the shirts did arrive in a few days, and I could finally toss the old ones into the trash and congratulate myself on a job well done.<br />That’s when the emails really started coming. At all hours of the night and day, they would whisper to me—or scream. 25% off. 40% off! Free shipping. 25% off and free shipping! Last chance for 75% off and free shipping!!<br />I like being alerted to fantastic discounts on quality merchandise. And free shipping. I really do. The problem is, there is only so much underwear that any one person can wear at any one time.</td>

      <td>Tommy Lasorda, the Hall of Fame manager whose colorful personality and boundless enthusiasm for his beloved Los Angeles Dodgers made him one of baseball’s most popular ambassadors and icons in Southern California and beyond, died late Thursday.<br />Lasorda had been hospitalized in mid-November and returned home earlier this week, before suffering a sudden cardiopulmonary arrest, the Dodgers said. He was 93.<br />Lasorda spent more than 70 years with the Dodgers, beginning as a pitcher when the franchise still played in Brooklyn and ending as an adviser in the front office. He was best known for his time in the dugout, where he managed the Dodgers from 1976 to 1996, winning four National League pennants and two World Series. His last championship came in 1988—thanks in part to Kirk Gibson’s legendary home run off Dennis Eckersley in Game 1—a victory that stood as the Dodgers’ most recent title until just last season.<br />Lasorda assumed an executive role after he retired as manager, but he often seemed more like an unofficial cheerleader for his favorite team and the sport he adored. He once said that he loved doubleheaders, because, “That way I get to keep my uniform on longer.”<br />As a manager, Lasorda was often praised for his leadership qualities and relentless optimism, an attitude he used to inspire his players. He was loquacious and quotable, allowing him to maintain a full schedule as a pitchman, charity booster and motivational speaker. Asked once to describe his managerial philosophy, he responded, “Contented cows give better milk.” He cited Ralph Houk, one of his minor-league managers, as his inspiration, telling a biographer, “Ralph taught me that if you treat players like human beings, they will play like Superman.”</td>

Trump administration officials said other lenders would follow soon after, but didn’t specify when.<br />Congress last month authorized $284 billion to provide forgivable loans to small businesses as part of its broader, $900 billion coronavirus relief bill. The new iteration of PPP will be far smaller than the original, which doled out $525 billion between April and August, and more narrowly focused on smaller businesses that can demonstrate need.<br />The program’s reopening comes at a crucial time for many small businesses that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic’s economic fallout and a resurgence in cases this winter. The National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business advocacy group, conducted a survey of its membership in early December and found that 45% of nearly 600 respondents would apply or reapply for a PPP loan if the program were to reopen.</td>

      <td>Fearing the competition for women patients, physicians barred the door to female doctors—until the Blackwells wrenched it open.</td>
      <td>America in the mid-19th century was rampant with many varieties of uncontrolled disease, while the art of medicine was at best rudimentary and at worst likely to kill. Doctors treated typhus by prescribing copious drafts of brandy and, when that failed, by rubbing the patient’s inner thighs with cayenne pepper. For ladies afflicted with gynecological ailments, standard remedies included arsenic, mustard poultices, leeches and fizzy lemonade.<br />City hospitals of the time had evolved from poorhouses and served as final refuges for the destitute. Often unheated and always overcrowded, they were more successful at spreading illness than at curing it. Sepsis and cholera tore through the wards, while resident physicians rotated daily through surgeries, childbirths and postmortems without washing their hands. Babies commonly died; children who survived had good odds of succumbing later to tuberculosis, influenza, typhoid fever and a host of other contagions whose means of transmission no one yet understood.<br />To qualify as a doctor in America during that pestilential era required alarmingly less effort than in such European capitals as Edinburgh or Paris, whose medical schools were more sophisticated. In 1869, the president of Harvard University, Charles Eliot, issued this warning: “The whole system of medical education in this country needs thorough reformation. The ignorance and general incompetency of the average graduate of the American medical Schools, at the time when he receives the degree which turns him loose upon the community, is something horrible to contemplate.”<br />Eliot was not exaggerating. Admission to medical school was nearly automatic for anyone who could scrape up the fees. During an initial term of 16 weeks, students were allowed to attend each lecture only after buying a ticket. During a second 16-week session, they attended the identical lectures and paid again. Between the two terms they tried to find some way to observe a doctor in practice. That was it. Rare was the student who examined a living patient or handled any instrument other than the pen he used for lecture notes. A fortunate few might chance upon a cadaver with which to attempt a dissection, but there were no guarantees. New physicians often received their diplomas without having gained any experience at all.<br />Aside from tuition fees, there was one other impediment to entering this slapdash enclave: You had to be a man. Women could be nurses, midwives or “doctresses”—ill-reputed purveyors of snake oil and abortifacients—but the notion of a licensed female physician was unimaginable.</td>

      <td>Though he was overshadowed by his charismatic bandmates, Chris Hillman wanted to be a rock ’n’ roll star too.</td>
      <td>Chris Hillman has always been happy to be second-in-command, a role he explores in his memoir “Time Between: My Life as a Byrd, Burrito Brother, and Beyond.” As the shy Mr. Hillman tried to blend into the background at a London party in 1965, John Lennon nodded toward him and asked the others, “Does he talk?”<br />Mr. Hillman never shared the name recognition or charisma of Byrds co-founders Roger McGuinn and David Crosby, and though he was a founding member of the Flying Burrito Brothers, it’s the doomed genius and eternal youth of Gram Parsons that people remember. Mr. Hillman is front and center on the cover of “Manassas,” a genre-bending glory of the early ’70s, but it was Stephen Stills’s band. For a brief period later, in the wake of CSNY, when every band was a potential supergroup, he found his name above the title, but “The Souther-Hillman-Furay Band” and “McGuinn, Clark & Hillman” never tripped readily off the tongue. He later found the country charts with the Desert Rose Band and made a string of excellent solo albums, the most recent of which, “Bidin’ My Time” (2017), was the final production of fan Tom Petty.<br />Yet seconds-in-command aren’t also-rans. Mr. Hillman, a Rock & Roll Hall of Famer with four Grammy nominations to his name, has as solid a claim as anyone—though he modestly does not make it—to have invented the entire genre of country rock. His early bluegrass contributions to the Byrds found their apotheosis in 1968’s “Sweetheart of the Rodeo,” which has become latterly influential, a wellspring of today’s alt-country movement. By that time, Mr. Hillman had emerged both as a songwriter (including the classic “So You Want to Be a Rock ’n’ Roll Star”) and a singer: the secret of the Byrds’ vocal chemistry was not three-part harmony but that two sang in unison as Mr. Crosby soared above.<br />The first 50 pages of “Time Between” detail a Southern California upbringing in San Diego County’s then-rural Rancho Santa Fe: a succession of dogs and horses vie with the sequential appeal of TV cowboys, scooters and surfing until music starts calling the tune. The suicide of Mr. Hillman’s father—on which he blames much of his hot temper—marks the end of this idyllic childhood; his future lay north in L.A., via fledgling bluegrass bands with wondrous period names like the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers. Then, “like that moment in The Wizard of Oz when everything goes from black and white to color,” the Beatles play Ed Sullivan. Mr. Hillman auditions for the Byrds on electric bass, despite being a mandolin picker who has never played even a double bass, and immediately finds himself in a Hollywood of almost mythical glamour for the band’s 1965 residency on the Sunset Strip at Ciro’s Le Disc, a scene on the cusp: so recently the haunt of Spencer Tracy and Errol Flynn, now a hangout for Sonny & Cher.<br />The cutthroat mentality of a band on the make is tactfully told. Mr. Hillman, a longtime Christian who understands that it’s all about motes and beams, is as discreet about other people’s bad choices as he is about his own, and “Time Between” gives him a chance to reflect, make amends and give thanks. Those wanting gorier details of Mr. Crosby’s shenanigans, Mr. Stills’s control-freakery or Parsons’s drug abuse should look elsewhere.</td>

      <td>Where did America’s global dominance begin? In Stephen Wertheim’s view, look to the fall of France in 1940.</td>
      <td>How fast it was, really, for America to become No. 1. It took a mere five summers—so short a time in the grand sweep of Great Power politics—for a vague ambition held in the minds of a small group of American intellectuals before 1940 to become the firm grand strategy of the Republic by June 1945. One month earlier than that, in May, the Supreme Allied Commander of the West’s forces in Europe, five-star American Army Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, had accepted the Nazi surrender. Six thousand miles away, and only a few weeks later, the nations of the free world met to sign the U.N. Charter in San Francisco and formed a new international order very much along American lines. Even as that historic event was happening, the President of the United States was preparing, confidently, to further arrange the world’s future at Potsdam. And while Harry Truman was sailing back from Europe after the Potsdam Conference, he ordered the dropping of the first atomic bomb upon a distant, battered Japan. This was world power as had never been seen before; little wonder that both its supporters and its few remaining doubters shook their heads in awe. Was this not, indeed, manifest destiny?<br />For almost 80 years now, historians and diplomats have sought not only to describe America’s swift advance to global primacy but also to explain it, and the sheer number of contending schools of thought—patriotic, revisionist, realist, liberal-internationalist—is not surprisingly very large. Any writer wanting to make a novel contribution either has to have evidence for a new interpretation, or at least be making an older argument in some improved and eye-catching way. Stephen Wertheim’s “Tomorrow, the World” does both. The book is a re-statement, in a more sophisticated form, of the old left-wing claim that the rising U.S. internationalism of this time was a cloak for ambitious quasi-imperialist policies. But the text also presents “new” archival materials, and uses them to advance a seriously original claim about exactly when and why the transformation occurred.<br />Mr. Wertheim, a historian at Columbia University and Deputy Director of Research and Policy at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, takes his first bold step by presenting the argument that it was not Pearl Harbor and events in the Pacific in late 1941 that pulled America out of isolationism, but rather the shocking fall of France in June 1940. Previous scholarship has hardly ignored the impact upon American politics of the seismic shaking of the Atlantic world that summer and autumn, and the rush of U.S. measures to shore up its own security (the naval Acts, the destroyer-bases deal). But no historian before Mr. Wertheim has shown in such detail how a small, networked bunch of Ivy League-elite public intellectuals and strategists—Rhodes scholars galore and underwritten by the Rockefeller Foundation—could step in and use the shock of France’s fall to articulate their visions of the path forward for the American Republic from their posts at such organizations as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Yale Institute for International Studies and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. Acting as the State Department’s virtual “think tank” for the country’s future, the CFR and the many planning sub-groups it spawned stepped forward to convince important senators, the broader Congress, the American newspapers and the public at large that their nation should now assume the many burdens of global leadership. For if the United States would not stop the Fascist threat to world domination, who else could? Their interventionist and Atlanticist drumbeat was loud, then, even before Pearl Harbor gave these folks the chance to push the country into the role they wanted to assume in any case.<br />Mr. Wertheim’s second, even bolder argument is that virtually all these intellectuals took America’s greatness for granted. Whether they were of the harder-nosed “realist” tradition (like University of Chicago professor Hans Morgenthau and Yale professor Nicholas Spykman), or advocates of a new United Nations-based security architecture (like professors James T. Shotwell and Leo Pasvolsky), all of them held that global leadership was their birthright. Because America was an inherently “good thing,” the world and the world-system American made could only benefit when the country acted in its own best interests. America’s good was the planet’s good, and vice-versa. Only by the end of 1945—after the atomic bombs, the carve-up of Europe at the Potsdam conference, and the spread of America’s military footprint across the globe—did a few American voices remain (the thoughtful political scientists Quincy Wright was one) to wonder whether the nation was embracing too much the world of raw power-politics.<br />Given the ambitious title and subtitle, ”The Birth of U.S. Global Supremacy,” of Mr. Wertheim’s book, though, it is important to understand what it is not about. While the striking dust-jacket shows that famous 1943 modernist poster of aircraft, warships and tanks advancing out of American factories, “Tomorrow the World” is not about the creation of the U.S. military-industrial complex, nor is it much interested in the story of the emergence of American financial dominance over the rest of the world (the U.S. Treasury, tellingly, is not in the index). The planners and strategists in and around the State Department, and the academics and public intellectuals of the CFR, all took the untrammeled American economic and military might for granted. They did not bother much about how or even where the U.S. armed forces fought the war, or the tough strategy debates about a second front, or the type of weapons systems deployed to defeat Japan. The important role of the formidable Adm. Ernest J. King, whose Navy took over the entire Pacific realm, is not covered here, nor is that of Hap Arnold, the architect of American global air power. Roosevelt’s closest military aide, his confidante Adm. William D. Leahy, described in a recent biography as “The Second Most Powerful Man in the World,” has no entry in the index; nor, remarkably, does the Secretary of War Henry Stimson. Yet, by contrast, the realist thinker Spykman gets a lot of mention, and internationalist Quincy Wright even more. Significantly, the Council on Foreign Relations itself gets the most coverage, and more pages, than any other subject in this book. After all, “Tomorrow, the World” is a study in American foreign-policy thinking, not in the actual wielding and making of American power. This is intellectual history, in the broadest sense of that term.</td>

      <td>Radical abolitionists saw the Constitution as poisoned by slavery. Could it instead be a tool in the hands of liberators?</td>
      <td>An early version of what became the 13th Amendment—the amendment that abolished slavery throughout the country—would have protected slavery in any state where it existed. Framed on the eve of the Civil War, the so-called Corwin Amendment passed both houses of Congress in March 1861 with two-thirds majorities and received the endorsement of the incoming president, Abraham Lincoln. This obscure fact seems incompatible with the moral conflict at stake in the war that quickly followed. If Republicans were willing to deny the federal government the power to abolish slavery, why did the South bother to secede?<br />James Oakes’s “The Crooked Path to Abolition” provides an effective answer to this question. As shocking as the Corwin Amendment seems today, it merely expressed what was already “implied constitutional law,” as Abraham Lincoln himself explained. Virtually everyone, including abolitionists, agreed that the federal government had no constitutional authority to abolish slavery directly.<br />Instead, as Mr. Oakes relates, antislavery radicals developed an elaborate strategy for attacking slavery indirectly, exploiting powers that the Constitution already granted. First and foremost, Congress could prohibit the admission of any new slave states, a move that would alter the sectional equilibrium in favor of freedom. Second, Congress could abolish slavery in every jurisdiction over which it possessed sovereign jurisdiction, including the nation’s capital. Third, Congress could use its authority over commerce to eliminate the interstate slave trade, thus eviscerating the slave economy and limiting one of its cruelest dimensions. Fourth, Congress could recognize free blacks as American citizens and insist on due-process rights for fugitive slaves. Finally, the federal government could use its control over patronage to promote the antislavery cause within Southern states.<br />Antebellum slaveholders considered each of these possibilities a fatal threat to their social order, and after Lincoln was elected in 1860 they demanded guarantees against them.. Lincoln and the Republicans refused. As an alternative, in what the South considered a false gesture of goodwill, they disavowed the one threat—the direct abolition of slavery by the federal government—that no reasonably informed Southerner actually feared. The result was war.<br />Mr. Oakes, a distinguished Civil War historian and a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, describes the development of these constitutional antislavery strategies concisely and clearly. At just over 200 pages, his book contains more insightful analysis than countless massive tomes on the antislavery movement. Indeed, historians have generally slighted the strategies that Mr. Oakes emphasizes in favor of the absolutist position taken by the radical abolitionist movement, whose most prominent champion was William Lloyd Garrison.</td>

      <td>The novel ‘Hatchet’ set a boy in the wilderness. In a new memoir, the author shares his own gripping journey.</td>
      <td>In Gary Paulsen’s acclaimed 1986 novel, “Hatchet,” a boy gets stranded alone in the Canadian wilderness after a plane crash. Equipped only with his wits and a small hatchet, the boy, Brian Robeson, struggles to find sustenance, make fire, and build a shelter while contending with wild animals and the implacable elements. Necessity compels the boy to focus on what is immediate, those moment-to-moment decisions that will determine whether he lives or starves; only rarely can he step back and contemplate the raw beauty of his surroundings. It all feels authentic. As with Jack London, another chronicler of persistence in harsh environments, we can tell with Gary Paulsen that he writes from experience—that he has faced hardships and has had to be resourceful.<br />Even so, many readers may be shocked to learn the harrowing nature of Mr. Paulsen’s tutorial in the school of life; how close a thing it was that he ever grew to be literate, let alone a full-grown man. Now in his 80s, Mr. Paulsen presents an unflinching account of his early years in “Gone to the Woods” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 357 pages $17.99), a memoir that contains moments of searing trauma that are leavened only by the abiding wonder of the author’s survival.<br />Mr. Paulsen doesn’t tarry: By the second page, readers ages 9-16 know that his mother left her family’s Minnesota farm during World War II, moved to Chicago to take a factory job and became a drunk. She would bring her son along to bars and get him to dance on tabletops and sing. Four-year-old Gary liked that, because the beery men would cheer. He liked less certain episodes, obliquely referenced here, that suggest sloppy scenes when his mother brought her admirers home.<br />And then, suddenly—which is how adult resolution feels to children—he was out of it and on a train alone, all of 5, traveling to stay with his Aunt Edy and Uncle Sig on a homestead full of hissing geese and ornery hens. For the child Gary—and for the writer the child would become—this was a formative time, for it was with Sig that he learned how hard he could work, how few words a man needed, and what glory there was in the wild. Mr. Paulsen recalls paddling a canoe with his uncle through an archway of trees, with dragonflies dancing all around, and having a revelation: “And there it was—the moment—the very split second, of all the minutes of all time the boy would ever have, that would never cease to exist. The moment—though he would not know it or understand it fully until he was an older man—when he would never again be able to, nor even want to, separate himself from nature. He had become folded into it; he had become an integral part of water and trees and birds and dragonflies. The moment was so pure, so profound, that he caught himself holding his breath.”<br />His idyll with Sig and Edy did not last long. Mr. Paulsen’s mother turned up and took the boy to the Philippines, where his father was serving in the U.S. military. Neglect seems to have been an art form with this couple, for by the time he was 7 Gary Paulsen was scavenging for food on the bomb-blown streets of Manila. Worse was to come. There are scenes in “Gone to the Woods” that linger and appall, so it might seem unlikely that such an unflinching account could have an uplifting effect. Yet it does. A child may grow up in privation, and he may grow up in ease, but suffering comes to all. Through his example, Gary Paulsen models how it can be overcome.</td>

      <td>With his last work, Winston Groom brings to life the acrimonious split between former friends.</td>
      <td>Fake news, partisan bickering and juvenile name-calling is nothing new in American politics. The election of 1800 was so savagely fought that it resulted in a deadly duel, a constitutional amendment and lifelong estrangement among the Founding Fathers. Whatever we might think of modern political discourse, present-day mud-slingers are relative amateurs when stacked against their 18th-century forebears.<br />Winston Groom, best known for his novel “Forrest Gump,” devoted the second half of his literary career to American history. His earlier nonfiction works usually focused on events, like the Battle of New Orleans (“Patriotic Fire”), Stephen Kearny’s Western adventures (“Kearny’s March”) and the American Civil War (“Shiloh, 1862,” “Vicksburg, 1863”)—though he also meandered into Alabama football (“The Crimson Tide”), World War I (“A Storm in Flanders”) and presidential biography (“Ronald Reagan”).<br />In his final decade, Groom’s pen shifted to triangular relationships among military leaders. “The Aviators” covered the airplane’s rise through the eyes of Eddie Rickenbacker, Jimmy Doolittle and Charles Lindbergh. “The Generals” looked at George Patton, Douglas MacArthur and George C. Marshall. “The Allies” went a step higher, painting an entertaining portrait of the Big Three—Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin—as they crushed the Nazis and built a world that lasted half a century.<br />Continuing his study of political ménages à trois, Groom steps back to the nation’s birth with “The Patriots: Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and the Making of America.” Released two months after his death in September, “Patriots” is a synthesis of archived letters, popular biographies and colorful insights, with a nod or two to the Broadway hit “Hamilton.”<br />Groom reprises the formula he deployed for “Generals” and “Allies,” and begins with short biographies of his central characters. Hamilton’s unlikely rise from the poverty of St. Croix will strike a familiar note to fans of “Hamilton.” The Schuyler sisters, Lafayette, John Laurens and Maria Reynolds take their obligatory bows as Hamilton’s journey from trading clerk to Treasury secretary plays out.</td>

      <td>The conventional wisdom about Beijing’s supposed advantages in AI and 5G shows how incomplete tech knowledge can lead to policy mistakes</td>
      <td>The U.S.-China relationship will be the great geopolitical rivalry of the early 21st century, and every facet of the competition will involve the two big powers’ capabilities in science and technology. Figures from across the political spectrum worry about a technology race with China, and many Americans fear that China has already surpassed us in such frontier technologies as artificial intelligence and 5G broadband communications. “China has stolen a march and is now leading in 5G,” then-Attorney General William Barr declared in a recent keynote speech at a Justice Department conference on China. Graham Allison of Harvard University warns that China “is currently on a trajectory to overtake the United States in the decade ahead” in artificial intelligence.<br />The conventional wisdom about China’s supposed advantages in AI and 5G shows how easy it is for incomplete understanding of technologies to lead to misjudgments and policy mistakes. Balancing economic and security considerations requires considerable knowledge of specific technologies—not just a current snapshot but also a sense of how the fundamentals will shape their evolution. We believe that the most effective U.S. policies will pair openness to China with scrupulous efforts to manage the risks posed by specific technologies.<br />Let’s start with AI, where outdated analogies have led to wrongheaded policies. Prof. Allison has dubbed China “the Saudi Arabia of the twenty-first century’s most valuable commodity”: data. But this fashionable metaphor implies that China’s larger supply of data—garnered from its more than one billion people, with very limited privacy protection—gives it a big advantage. Chinese machine-learning algorithms can be trained on far larger data sets, this line of thinking contends, and can thus advance more quickly and powerfully than their American counterparts.<br />This assessment makes two fundamental errors. For one, data aren’t interchangeable. Machine learning depends on specialized data sets, not mountains of undifferentiated data points. For another, this argument ignores the law of diminishing returns. Infinitely larger supplies of an input like data don’t produce infinitely better results; indeed, they may actually reduce performance. For many AI tasks, machine simulations are more productive than mountains of data.<br />When people think of AI functions that must be sequestered from China, they are often thinking of AI as a specific device or program, like HAL, the omniscient computer in the movie “2001: A Space Odyssey.” But AI is actually a variety of procedures applied to different tasks. Almost all AI research is public and conducted by a global community of researchers. Only a very few applications for specialized security tasks need to be classified and subject to export controls.</td>

      <td>Decentralized health system, holiday pause in vaccinations hampers rollout</td>
      <td>OTTAWA—Canadian authorities are scrambling to make up lost ground in their quest to vaccinate vulnerable people against Covid-19, after an initial rollout that many public-health officials are criticizing as slow and disorganized.<br />While Canada was quick to order vaccines and approved the use of the shot developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  in early December—two days before the U.S. authorized it—the nation has fallen behind several of its developed-country peers in administering vaccinations.<br />Just over 0.5% of the population of the U.S.’s northern neighbor was vaccinated as of Wednesday. By comparison, the U.S. had vaccinated 1.6% of its population by that date, and Israel had inoculated more than 18%, according to Our World in Data, a nonprofit research project at the University of Oxford. The U.K. had vaccinated about 1.9% of its population by Jan. 3, the latest date for which vaccination numbers were available.<br />Public-health experts say Canadian officials have struggled to move vaccine doses quickly from industrial freezers where they need to be stored to long-term care facilities where elderly residents are among the first designated inoculation. The rollout has been complicated by a decentralized health system run by individual provinces and territories and by Ontario’s decision to pause vaccinations in the country’s most populous province for two days during the holidays.<br />The head of the provincial government’s vaccine task force, retired Gen. Rick Hillier, later said the pause was the wrong decision, made under the expectation that long-term care homes would have fewer staff available to receive vaccine doses during the holidays.</td>

CBS is seeking as much as $5.5 million per commercial for the Super Bowl, people with knowledge of the matter have said.<br />The league agreed to the additional ad inventory after requests from the broadcast networks, which had already sold the bulk of commercial time for the playoffs and wanted to capitalize on strong demand from advertisers.<br />“The marketplace has been very good,” said John Bogusz, executive vice president of sports sales for CBS. Mr. Bogusz said the network is close to sold out for the playoffs and has a few spots remaining for the Super Bowl.</td>

      <td>A sheepskin coat is a winter staple, but a phone case? We explain why brands like Cos, Louis Vuitton and Bottega Veneta are using so much of the fuzzy stuff.</td>
      <td>GROWING up in Minnesota where winter temperatures often hover below freezing, Katy Sturgis, 40, learned a few things about dressing for warmth. “My mother had beautiful shearling coats, and once I got older, I loved any opportunity to wear one,” said Ms. Sturgis, who has five shearling toppers of her own. Now living in the somewhat warmer Portland, Ore., the fitness instructor has expanded her shearling wardrobe to include lighter fuzzy pieces like clog boots, fingerless gloves and a shearling-lined denim jacket that combine style and function.<br />In their fall 2020 collections, flocks of fashion brands embraced the plush life too. Some offer fairly sensible luxe styles.  Louis Vuitton ’s  shearling-lined houndstooth blazer is perfect for dining al fresco in a fancy yurt. And Bottega Veneta’s butter-hued maxi coat will keep you toasty in a city snow squall. Others, however, flirt with frivolity. There’s no practical reason a fanny pack, phone case or handbag should be made of shearling, but it sure does look cool. Ditto for this season’s sneakers, boots and Mary Janes that come wrapped in the stuff. Shearling is in, even when it’s curiously inside-out. Who cares if that means frostbitten toes?<br />Shearling’s calming texture might explain why so many designers are peddling puzzling sheepskin wares, both real and faux. The cuddly material is soothing and reassuringly soft in these pandemic times. “Touch, tactile experience is really important to me,” said Mallory Farrugia, 34, who owns a creative agency in Brooklyn. She styles her two pairs of No. 6 shearling-lined clog boots with everything from casual jeans to dresses with tights. Last year, she even softened up her living room with a sheepskin rug, an addition to a faux shearling blanket and pillows. “Having the sheepskin underfoot sparks a bit of joy on a winter day,” she said.<br />The appetite for shearling everything is increasing. Maria Lye, the Paris-based Australian designer who founded the brand Toasties—whose website is widely considered a shearling Shangri-La—reports business has been booming in recent months. Toasties currently offers dozens of different Crayola-colored shearling accouterments including bandannas, berets and bicycle seat covers. And its future looks even fuzzier: Ms. Lye, 33, plans to launch blankets, pillows and other home accessories later this year.<br />As we herd toward peak shearling, is there a danger of fluff overkill? To avoid woolly-mammoth comparisons, refrain from wearing it head to toe. Los Angeles designer Jenni Kayne, whose shearling-lined mules are a cult favorite, suggests you restrict yourself to a single piece. Ms. Lye, who wears up to five shearling accessories at once, follows a “more is better” philosophy. However, she draws the line at jewelry. “I wouldn’t recommend earrings or a necklace in shearling,” she said. Indeed, that would just look silly.</td>

Japan immediately rejected the ruling, saying the issue was settled in a 1965 treaty that normalized relations and an agreement in 2015 that provided financial support for the so-called comfort women.<br />“This is completely unacceptable,” Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said. “I strongly urge the South Korean government to take measures to correct this violation of international law.”<br />Japan’s foreign ministry summoned the South Korean ambassador in Tokyo to protest.<br />The ruling puts President-elect Joe Biden in an awkward position as his administration seeks to build a broad alliance of allies, said Jin Chang-soo, a Japan expert at the Sejong Institute, a think tank near Seoul.</td>

      <td>China opened its own hog futures market, the culmination of a yearslong effort to create a transparent pricing mechanism for one of the country’s most valuable agricultural products.<br />On Friday, traders, farmers and other market participants began buying and selling contracts for live pig deliveries in September 2021, December 2021 and March 2022. Prices for all three tumbled more than 7% from opening levels set by the exchange, with the front-month contract closing on Friday afternoon at 28,290 yuan a metric ton, which is equivalent to $4,367.98 a metric ton and works out to about $1.98 a pound.<br />The price drops reflect expectations that China’s hog population—the world’s largest—will continue to expand after earlier being decimated by the deadly African swine fever in 2018 and 2019.<br />China is home to more than 370 million pigs, and is also the world’s largest consumer of pork, a staple in many Chinese households. Over the past two years, average spot prices of live hogs have soared and swung widely, influenced by the prices Chinese farmers receive when they take their pigs to local slaughterhouses on any given day.<br />Large price fluctuations have accompanied a recovery in the country’s swine population over the course of 2020, as domestic farmers worked to rebuild their herds after losing many pigs to the disease. Pork prices, meanwhile, are rising again ahead of the 2021 Lunar New Year holiday, when meat consumption typically increases.</td>

      <td>If President-elect Joe Biden bats the thorny question of tech taxes down the road the way Democratic predecessor Barack Obama did, investors will pay the price.<br />U.S. tech giants are already handing over so-called digital-service taxes to the French government. Unless the incoming administration restarts global efforts to reform corporate-tax rules, the likes of Alphabet, Apple and  Facebook  will soon face myriad such levies around the globe. On Thursday, the U.S. trade representative said it would delay retaliatory action against France promised by President Trump, essentially leaving the problem for Mr. Biden.<br />U.S. backing is crucial for a deal. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development started working in 2013 to update industrial-era corporate tax rules for online companies and crack down on what many countries see as aggressive tax avoidance. But the project was soon shelved because of a lack of support from then-President Obama.<br />Mr. Biden won’t necessarily hold the same view of global tax reform he did back then. A lot has changed politically and economically. The incoming administration has also talked of taking a much stronger stance on the regulation and antitrust treatment of big tech companies.<br />With a technical solution in sight, a deal could be done this year if the U.S. wants it. Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul changed the rules at home, renewing the U.S. Treasury’s interest in global reform. That revived the OECD project, which made rapid progress until last summer. It stalled after Washington appeared to get cold feet.</td>

But venture-capital firms see silver linings in the possibility for an easier visa process for foreign workers and support for clean energy technologies.<br />Victories by Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in two Senate runoff elections this week mean Democrats will soon control both branches of Congress and the presidency for the first time in a decade. Experts on Capitol Hill say they expect the next Congress to seek higher taxes on corporations and well-paid individuals, including many employees of private investment companies, and increase scrutiny on what critics see as abuses by buyout firms.<br />The Democratic wins in Georgia are also expected to elevate Democrats to leadership roles on Senate committees, making it easier for President-elect Joe Biden to appoint nominees to federal agencies.<br />Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), who could be promoted to head the Banking Committee, supported the 2019 Stop Wall Street Looting Act, a proposal headed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) to rein in private equity.<br />That proposal, which never went to a vote, is unlikely to be a priority for the new Congress, which is closely divided and must first address the health and economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, among other pressing issues. But private equity should brace for more challenges and hearings from the Democratic leadership, said Milan Dalal, a former Senate aide and current managing partner of public-affairs and lobbying firm Tiger Hill Partners.</td>

      <td>Unreliable flows and inconsistent narratives have sent different stock markets in Asia sharply higher, with many now outperforming U.S. equities</td>
      <td>Equity markets are seeing a strong start to the year globally. In parts of Asia, maybe too strong.<br />Six months ago, it was common to hear that while U.S. markets might recover a large portion of early-2020 losses quickly, emerging markets would be slower to bounce back. But the MSCI EM Index is practically level with the MSCI USA for the past 12 months, and many Asian equity indexes are way above U.S. peers.<br />The Taiwanese and South Korean bourses are the most obvious examples. The Taiex and Kospi are up 45% and 36%, respectively, since the beginning of 2020, while the S&P 500 is up more like 18%. China’s equity market recorded a strong 2020, but the most interesting performances may be outside the world’s second-largest economy.<br />Perhaps most perplexing is India’s equity stock market. The Sensex index now matches the S&P 500’s gain in dollar terms for the same period. India, of course, has nothing like the capacity of the U.S. to support the economy with either monetary or fiscal policy. Its price to earnings ratio for the 12 months ahead has risen even more than its U.S. equivalent since the nadir in March.<br />The countries performing well each have some things going for them: India will be one of the first developing countries in the world to begin a vaccine campaign, South Korea’s low number of Covid-19 cases has been a model for countries with active outbreaks, and Taiwan has managed to keep itself almost hermetically sealed away from the pandemic.</td>

      <td>Investors and politicians have made their views clear about oil’s uncertain future. Consumers, not so much.</td>
      <td>You might be filling up your tank a lot longer than  BP  thinks.<br />Ambitious green policies—from politicians and even the newly climate-conscious oil companies—suggest the world is moving at warp speed away from fossil fuels. But the transition might not be easy on consumers’ wallets, which is precisely why it could take a while.<br />The idea of “peak oil,” historically a reference to a fear that oil supply was running out, now means something entirely different. British energy giant BP suggested that oil demand might have already reached its apex in 2019 if one were to imagine a world that doubles down on policies that restrict carbon emissions.<br />Others are more conservative. Under its “stated policies scenario,” the International Energy Agency estimates that oil demand will peak around 2030 and plateau. That scenario takes into account announced policy measures and its own judgment of how attainable they seem. As the IEA acknowledges, though, some of the declared policies are far-reaching targets. Chris Midgley, head of analytics at S&P Global Platts, says his group projects the world is unlikely to reach peak demand until the late 2030s, noting that demand for petrochemicals in particular seems resilient.<br />Transportation plays a key role in the timing of that peak; it accounts for the largest share of petroleum consumption globally. For electricity to crowd out oil as a transportation fuel, governments must either provide taxpayer subsidies that make electric vehicles more affordable or place a cost on not switching over, such as even higher taxes at the pump.</td>

KATIE PORTER, the California Democrat whose interrogations of financial executives and Trump administration officials gained wide notice, is unlikely to remain on the House Financial Services Committee, after Democratic leaders have been unresponsive to her requests for a waiver that would allow her to continue serving on the panel despite having two other committee assignments. Porter has been added to the Natural Resources Committee for the new Congress, and remains on the Oversight Committee. But she has pushed to remain on Financial Services, given her background in bankruptcy law that has made her an ally of progressives including her mentor, Sen. Elizabeth Warren.<br />Porter sent a letter requesting a waiver to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Nov. 30. After not getting an affirmative response, she sent another on Wednesday, noting that five waivers remain available for members to join the committee while retaining their other committee assignments. A Pelosi spokesman didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />“If you do not grant me a waiver to serve on Financial Services, I respectfully request the ability to continue my decades of work on financial issues through service” on a select committee on economic disparities, Porter wrote in the letter reviewed by the Journal.<br />Porter’s questioning style, often featuring a white board and a Socratic give-and-take with witnesses, made her one of the most high-profile first-term House members during the last Congress and led to speculation that she would run for Senate. Porter flipped a competitive district in Orange County, Calif., in 2018 and expanded her margin of victory to seven points in 2020.<br /></td>

Apple shelved an earlier effort to develop its own car a few years ago to focus on driverless car technology.<br />Apple declined to comment.<br />Hyundai, in saying Friday that it has held discussions with Apple, said that “as it is at [an] early stage, nothing has been decided.” In a later statement filed with Korean securities regulators, Hyundai said it had fielded requests of potential cooperation on electric vehicles from multiple companies. Hyundai, with affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. , ranks among the world’s largest auto makers by sales.</td>

      <td>DeVos says President Trump’s rhetoric contributed to deadly mob attack on Capitol Hill</td>
      <td>Education Secretary Betsy DeVos resigned Thursday night, becoming the second member of President Trump’s cabinet to quit since the deadly mob attack on Capitol Hill, which she said was fueled by Mr. Trump’s rhetoric.<br />“We should be highlighting and celebrating your Administration’s many accomplishments on behalf of the American people,” Mrs. DeVos wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump obtained by The Wall Street Journal. “Instead we are left to clean up the mess caused by violent protesters overrunning the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the people’s business. That behavior was unconscionable for our country. There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me.”<br />Her resignation is effective Friday. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said earlier Thursday she would resign, citing the “entirely avoidable” storming of the Capitol building.<br />Mrs. DeVos had been one of the administration’s longest-serving cabinet members—and one of its most polarizing. When the Senate confirmed her nomination in February 2017, she was the first cabinet nominee in U.S. history to require a tiebreaking vote from the vice president—in this case, Mike Pence.<br />Teachers’ unions and progressive activists had strongly opposed her for her lifelong work promoting charter schools, which are publicly funded but often run by private firms. Mrs. DeVos, a Michigan billionaire, also supported vouchers, which use tax dollars to enable students to attend private schools.</td>
