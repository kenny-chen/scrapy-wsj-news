      <td>Demand for Xbox gaming consoles has outpaced supply</td>
      <td>Microsoft Corp.  is poised to post record quarterly sales underpinned by pandemic-fueled demand for videogaming and accelerated adoption of its cloud-computing services.<br />The software giant’s fiscal second-quarter earnings due Tuesday afternoon will reflect a period when demand for the latest versions of its Xbox videogame consoles has outstripped supply. Wall Street expects Microsoft to post $40.2 billion in sales, the highest for any three-month period and up around 9% from the prior-year quarter. Net income is expected to jump by $1 billion to $12.6 billion, according to FactSet.<br />The remote work era has been a boon for Microsoft. In addition to its videogaming and cloud-computing products, the company has seen strong sales for its Surface laptops as people bought devices to work remotely and enable distance learning. And use of Microsoft’s Teams workplace collaboration software that includes text chat and videoconferencing, and has been a priority for Chief Executive Satya Nadella, has jumped during the pandemic. Microsoft shares have risen more than 37% over the past year.<br />Mr. Nadella’s bet on cloud computing has been pivotal to Microsoft’s multiyear run of year-over-year sales increases. Sales for the company’s Azure cloud-services have expanded rapidly however, before the pandemic hit, the pace of growth was slowing as the business gained scale. The remote work era arrested that decline. Azure sales increased 48% in the September quarter, up from 47% expansion in the prior three-month period.<br />Azure became a bigger source of revenue for Microsoft than its Windows operating system licenses in the September quarter, said Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Piper Sandler. Microsoft doesn’t break out Azure revenue, but the company is the world’s second-largest cloud-computing vendor after  Amazon.com Inc.</td>

      <td>KAMPALA, Uganda—Ugandan rapper-turned-opposition leader Bobi Wine pledged to continue his fight to oust longtime President Yoweri Museveni, after soldiers released him from nearly two weeks of home detention following January’s disputed election.<br />Dozens of chanting supporters, waving the brightly colored flags of Mr. Wine’s National Unity Platform party, thronged his residence outside Kampala, a day after a court ruled that his detention was unlawful. Mr. Wine, whose bid to unseat Mr. Museveni after nearly 35 years in power struck a chord with many young voters, called on them to peacefully march against the outcome of the Jan. 14 vote.<br />“Museveni is using the military and the police in a partisan manner to oppress his opponents and to suppress our rights,” said Mr. Wine. “We are standing for what is moral and what is just.”<br />Soldiers confined Mr. Wine and his wife at their home a day after the election, which took place amid a total internet blackout and heavy security. According to the official results, which Mr. Wine says were rigged, he won 35% of the vote, compared with 59% for Mr. Museveni. Mr. Wine’s party has until Feb. 5 to challenge the outcome in court.<br />U.S. officials have said the results were fundamentally flawed and, along with other governments, urged an investigation into the deadly violence that preceded the vote. On polling day, police arrested 30 election observers, hours after the U.S. called off its own monitoring mission when many of its observers were denied accreditation.</td>

But modest growth in consumer-health products also contributed to the sales boost in the latest quarter.<br />Alex Gorsky, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said that Johnson & Johnson would soon share data from its final-stage study of the coronavirus vaccine it is developing. Emergency approval from the Food & Drug Administration could follow, and would bolster the U.S. supply of shots aimed at ending the pandemic amid a rocky vaccine rollout.<br />If study results, expected by early next week, are positive and the vaccine receives U.S. authorization, J&J expects to provide about 100 million doses for use in the U.S. by the end of June, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said in an interview. The federal government also has options to purchase additional doses beyond that.<br />J&J tested its vaccine as a single dose. The vaccine can be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures, whereas the two vaccines authorized in the U.S. are given in two doses and must be kept at frozen temperatures, before being thawed for administration.</td>

The pandemic created enormous pressure on demand for the N95 face masks that medical workers wear to guard against the virus. But sales of other products such as Post-it Notes used by office workers and teeth-polishing discs used by dentists were hurt by social-distancing measures.

      <td>Outlook has been buoyed by hopes for increasing vaccination and improved therapies to combat Covid-19</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The world economy is gearing up for a strong recovery from the pandemic in 2021 after shrinking considerably less than initially feared last year, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, though it warned that the outlook is subject to exceptional uncertainty.<br />Global output is projected to grow 5.5% this year, up from the IMF’s October forecast of a 5.2% increase. Last year’s estimated contraction of 3.5% was smaller than October’s forecast for a 4.4% contraction. China was the only major economy to grow last year, expanding by 2.3% amid effective containment measures and forceful economic support, the IMF said.<br />The outlook has been buoyed by hopes for increasing vaccination and improved therapies to combat Covid-19, which sparked widespread economic lockdowns last year. It assumes “broad vaccine availability in advanced economies and some emerging market economies in summer 2021 and across most countries by the second half of 2022,” the IMF said. That is faster than the multilateral lender expected when it published its previous set of forecasts in October.<br />Continued government spending measures in Japan and the U.S., where Congress authorized a $900 billion package in late December, contributed to the improved forecasts. The IMF expects the U.S. economy to grow 5.1% this year and Japan’s to expand by 3.1%. However, it lowered its forecast for the euro area to 4.2% growth from 5.2%. The IMF is the global lender of last resort to countries in distress.<br />The stronger-than-expected recovery masks significant disparities between high-skilled workers and their less-educated counterparts, the IMF’s chief economist, Gita Gopinath, said in a December interview. Similarly, rich countries are faring better than poor ones as the global pandemic nears its first anniversary.</td>

      <td>Young professionals who fled big cities for small towns during the pandemic are providing an unexpected boost to a type of real estate geared toward communal living.<br />Many of those who left were seeking fresh air, more space and distance from infection clusters, but they also found the prospect of being isolated in the country daunting. So they have been looking for companionship at remote co-living spaces, where tenants rent furnished rooms in big, shared homes.<br />These former vacation homes, farms or converted hotels offer a shared office space and a place to sleep for those who want temporary accommodation.<br />European millennials have been at the forefront of this trend. Coconat—short for community and concentrated work in nature—is in a village outside Berlin. The 5-acre property, based in a converted manor, includes shared offices, a sauna, a swimming pond, a yoga studio and 20 rooms for guests who get three meals a day and pay less rent than for a Berlin apartment.<br />“Every room is taken, and it’s surprising,” said co-founder Julianne Becker. “The people really want to get out of the cities.”</td>

The company said capital spending would fall between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion in 2021.<br />Verizon ended 2020 with a quarterly net gain of 279,000 postpaid phone connections compared with a gain of 790,000 in the same quarter a year earlier. Telephone companies prize so-called postpaid accounts, which charge customers monthly bills after service is rendered, for their stable revenue.<br />Rival carrier  T-Mobile US Inc.  this month issued preliminary results that showed an 824,000 postpaid-phone gain over the same span.  AT&T Inc.  plans to report its fourth-quarter results Wednesday.<br />Verizon last year pulled its sales projections and braced for a wave of past-due bills as millions of Americans lost their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic. As the year wore on, revenue losses were limited by Verizon’s more affluent customer base and the must-have nature of cellphone and home-internet service.</td>

In 2020, it is a mark of resilience, as strong exports and success in containing Covid-19 buoyed Asian economies against one of the worst global downturns in modern history.<br />The drop in gross domestic product, reported by the Bank of Korea on Tuesday, is expected to be one of the smallest among major economies, according to estimates from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.<br />The relative economic strength is reflected across Asia, where China finished the year with 2.3% growth and Vietnam at 2.9%. Taiwan is expected to report a 1.9% expansion for the year Friday, according to Fitch Solutions.<br />The Bank of Korea attributed South Korea’s relative economic durability during the pandemic to its large manufacturing industry, well-established online shopping base and strong pandemic-response measures.<br />“The recovery of global demand for our mainstream products like semiconductors in the second half of the year contributed to the economic cushioning,” said Park Yang-su, director general at the Bank of Korea’s economics statistics department.</td>

Looters raided shops, set cars ablaze and threw bicycles onto bonfires, pelting riot police with stones and fireworks in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, the Hague and several other cities.<br />The curfew, introduced Saturday, initially prompted peaceful but unauthorized demonstrations over the weekend in Amsterdam and other cities. Later, groups of mostly young men returned to public squares in several cities, prompting rioting and looting. Police deployed mounted units, tear gas and water cannons in Amsterdam to disperse crowds.<br />On Sunday night in Urk, a small town north of Amsterdam, rioters set a coronavirus testing center on fire.<br />Prime Minister Mark Rutte condemned the violence and said perpetrators will be prosecuted. “Any normal person will look at this with disgust and ask themselves what had gotten into these people,” he said. “This has nothing to do with protesting: It is criminal violence and we will treat it as such.”</td>

The company has been cutting corporate costs and jobs in its aviation unit while streamlining its power business.<br />The coronavirus pandemic continues to pressure GE’s jet-engine business, its largest division, but the overall results showed progress in the yearslong turnaround of the company that also makes health-care machines and power-generating equipment.<br />GE shares are up 60% in the last six months, closing Monday at $10.99, as investors are encouraged by continued improvement in cash flow, debt reduction and cost cutting. The S&P 500 index is up about 20% in the same period. GE shares gained about 4% in premarket trading Tuesday.<br />GE’s cash flow is closely watched as a sign of the health of the company’s operations and ability to pay down debts.

      <td>ROME—Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte resigned Tuesday, ushering in a phase of political instability that could lead either a new government or to elections this spring.<br />The breakdown of Italy’s left-leaning government comes as the country, like most of the Western world, is struggling to control the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, vaccinate its population and rekindle economic growth.<br />The Italian leader’s fall also shows that Europe’s political challenges of recent years—including the fragmentation of the political landscape and the rise of antiestablishment parties—haven’t gone away, despite the pressure that the pandemic is putting on European politicians to work together across party lines.<br />Mr. Conte stepped down after losing his majority in Italy’s Senate earlier this month, following a fight with a small coalition ally over how to spend massive funds offered by the European Union to help Italy’s economy recover from the impact of the pandemic.<br />Italy’s head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, will start political consultations with parties in Parliament to test whether a new governing majority can be found. Possible scenarios include a government under a new prime minister, or another coalition led by Mr. Conte.</td>

      <td>LONDON—Doctors began noticing the change last month as the U.K.’s new coronavirus variant spread. In hospital critical-care units, they were seeing more younger people and women with serious cases of Covid-19, a disease that previously inflicted its worst symptoms largely on older patients and men.<br />The shift—backed up now by statistical studies—is part of an urgent puzzle preoccupying British public-health officials as they race to understand a strain of the virus that is more transmissible and, some studies indicate, could be deadlier than earlier versions.<br />One early hypothesis, scientists say, is that one of the virus’s genetic mutations makes it better at invading a greater number of cells inside the body, leading to serious sickness in people who with previous Covid-19 variants would only have had mild or no symptoms.<br />David Strain, a physician and instructor at the University of Exeter’s medical school who is also treating Covid-19 patients, said initial research paints a picture of a virus variant that is like a burglar that has become better at breaking and entering—into vulnerable cells in this case, not houses.<br />“We think that’s why it’s making people sicker as well as being more transmissible,” Dr. Strain said.</td>

      <td>The frenetic trading of options by retail investors isn’t large enough to disrupt the primary purpose of equity capital markets</td>
      <td>Once upon a time, short sellers were the hotshot outsiders, energetically assaulting fusty old Wall Street. Now they’re on the ramparts looking down as armies of day traders use options to send the value of heavily-shorted stocks like  GameStop Corp.  surging.<br />Professional investors are worried: How can financial markets function when stock movements are so obviously disconnected from fundamentals, played by both sides like a videogame?<br />Those worries are understandable but overblown. Here, a little international comparison is helpful: Unlike some other major global equity markets, frenetic individual investors are far from the point where they are really disrupting the real purpose of equity markets—to help companies to raise capital.<br />Retail traders are associated with market inefficiency, because they’re considered more likely to trade on noise, accelerating surges and dips. Volatility isn’t good for companies that want a placid, reliable environment to raise capital in. That’s part of the reason special-purpose acquisition vehicles, or SPACs, boomed in popularity last year, with both investors and issuers looking to avoid a choppy stock market.<br />But there is a difference of degree internationally. Retail order flows have reached 20% of the U.S. stock market’s total, according to UBS research, twice what they were in 2010. Off-exchange trading, which includes but isn’t limited to retail, is up to a record 48% of the total, compared with 2019 levels of more like 35%. That is nothing though, relative to the over 80% that Chinese retail traders account for, according to recent research by U.S. and China-based academics.</td>

The company plans to reveal Tuesday that it has raised $590 million in new funding, Chief Executive Gene Berdichevsky told The Wall Street Journal.<br />Much of that money will be used to build a factory in the U.S. for making battery materials, he said. The location hasn’t yet been selected.<br />Other battery-focused startups, such as California-based  Romeo Power Inc.  and Canadian mining firm  Lithium Americas Corp. , which has U.S. operations, have also recently tapped public markets.

The bank said it is meeting all of its financial targets and is anticipating lower levels of bad loans from the pandemic than many rivals because of its safer lending to Swiss borrowers and the global rich.<br />The strong results were overshadowed by a criminal investigation into Mr. Hamers, who became CEO on Nov. 1 after a two-month handover period. Just over a month later, a Dutch court ordered a fresh probe into his role in a money-laundering scandal at his former employer, ING Groep NV. UBS has said it is backing Mr. Hamers in the probe, which is expected to take a year or more.<br />UBS seeks to bank the world’s rich and help them manage their wealth. It also competes with Wall Street banks in market trading and in advising companies on stock and debt deals, and mergers and acquisitions. Both areas had a bumper year as wealth clients rotated their investments and investment banking customers traded more and brought deals to take advantage of a rise in asset prices from government and central-bank stimulus.<br />The Swiss bank said its performance allowed it to set aside more capital in the fourth quarter to buy back shares and that it will purchase at least $1.1 billion worth of stock in the first quarter. It said it could buy back 4 billion Swiss francs worth of shares, equivalent to $4.5 billion, in the next three years.</td>

That is starting to change.<br />Owners of multifamily buildings are falling behind on loan payments. Banks view a greater number of rental loans as high risk, and fewer lenders are available to help struggling developers with financing. Eviction protections, lower rent collections and unprecedented declines in the asking rent in some urban markets are also taking their toll on apartment owners.<br />Niche corners of the multifamily business that were popular with investors before the pandemic are now some of the worst off. Ratings companies have downgraded bonds tied to senior-housing and student-housing properties, and some co-living companies, where tenants lease rooms in shared apartments, are also struggling. Earlier this month, the co-living operator Quarters closed all of its U.S. operations, filing for 10 bankruptcies.<br />But the traditional rental-apartment business is showing cracks, too. During the pandemic, the share of total apartment debt that banks place into their highest-risk categories has ballooned to 16.9% from 4.6%, according to a December report from Trepp LLC, a real-estate data firm that compiled risk ratings from more than a dozen major banks.<br />“A lot of this was driven by people being in stress,” said Russell Hughes, a vice president at Trepp. Landlords requested payment leniency on their loans, and this was a major factor in banks raising their risk assessments, he added.</td>

Once business restrictions are lifted and people feel it is safe to go out again, “there will be a lot of spending—my guess is the beaches will be crowded, the pubs will be crowded” and, “by May and June it will be in full swing,” he said.<br />President Biden is calling for a new $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package to help Americans weather the economic shock of the pandemic.

Ltd. and Gunvor Group, have lines of credit from banks that give them cheaper rates to finance reduced-carbon production of everything from oil to aluminum.  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. has a deal with European energy giant  Enel  SpA that offers incentives for the company to meet certain environmental targets by the end of 2022—and a penalty if those targets aren’t met.<br />Those discounts help produce and deliver the raw materials that power the global economy in a more sustainable way, some bankers and traders said. Green assets are already trendy on Wall Street, which sells a growing number of products aimed at improving the world and producing higher returns through so-called environmental, social and governance investing. The lending also helps banks, increasingly under pressure from shareholders and regulators, meet their own green-investing targets.<br />“There is an incredible hunger for clean assets,” said Neha Coulon, global head of ESG solutions at JPMorgan Chase. “At the end of every year, I saw ESG investing becoming more mainstream, but I wasn’t prepared for 2020 to be such a big year.”<br />The push for sustainability has prompted shifts throughout the commodities industry. Trafigura built a desk dedicated to trading low-carbon aluminum to keep up with demand for a cleaner version of the metal. Lightweight, recyclable and used in everything from electric cars to solar panels, aluminum still requires a large carbon footprint to produce, mostly because smelting processes have remained little changed for more than a century, industry experts said.</td>

Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin reaffirming their opposition to its elimination. Their statements earlier in the day signaled that Democrats don’t have the votes needed to kill the filibuster unilaterally, since that would require all 50 of them, plus Vice President Kamala Harris, to vote as a bloc.<br />President Biden, who served 36 years in the Senate, said during his presidential campaign that he would prefer to preserve the filibuster, unless GOP resistance to his legislative agenda made eliminating it necessary. Asked Friday whether Mr. Biden still opposes eliminating the filibuster, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: “The president’s position hasn’t changed.”<br />The Democratic senators “agree with President Biden’s and my view that no Senate majority should destroy the right of future minorities of both parties to help shape legislation,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement Monday night. In his statement, he pointed to a 2001 agreement—the last time there was a 50-50 Senate—as a model for 2021.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) had previously embraced that approach, which gave the parties equal seats on committees and let nominees and bills advance to the floor even if a committee vote was tied.</td>

      <td>Democrats can’t let go of Donald Trump even as a former President, so on Monday House managers walked their article of impeachment to the Senate for a trial. Their goal is to banish Mr. Trump from running for office again. The result may instead be his acquittal and political revival.<br />Democrats have already forced one impeachment trial, resulting in acquittal and no notable decline in his political standing. He lost the election due to his handling of Covid and its consequences. But now Democrats want to do it once more with feeling, after Mr. Trump urged his supporters to march on the Capitol on Jan. 6 with a goal of overturning the Electoral College vote for Joe Biden.<br />We’ve said Mr. Trump’s actions—and failure to act to stop the riot as it unfolded—were an impeachable offense and urged him to resign. But now he is out of office and no longer the “imminent threat” that House Democrats said justified their rushed impeachment. The question is what good purpose a Senate trial will serve, and that isn’t apparent.<br />The Democratic case is that Mr. Trump must be punished lest any future President try something similar in his final days. A conviction by two-thirds of the Senate would also open him to a majority vote barring Mr. Trump from running for public office again. But what if he is acquitted?<br />One problem is whether such a trial is even constitutional. We’ve run op-eds arguing pro and con. The language in the Constitution refers to impeachment against a President while in office, and Mr. Trump is now a private citizen. Chief Justice John Roberts doesn’t seem to believe he needs to preside over the trial because the Constitution stipulates that role for the Chief only for a President. Senior Democrat Pat Leahy will preside instead.</td>

      <td>Video platform Vimeo Inc. has completed a $300 million fundraising round that values the company at $5 billion, an 82% boost from a raise three months ago.<br />The round was led by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. and financial-services firm Oberndorf Enterprises LLC. The new capital will be used to fuel its growth, innovation and talent, Vimeo parent  IAC/InterActiveCorp  said Monday.<br />In November, Vimeo raised $150 million from technology-investment firm Thrive Capital and Singapore’s sovereign-wealth fund GIC Private Ltd. That investment valued the business at $2.75 billion.<br />Last month, IAC, an internet holding company, said it planned to spin off the online-video platform, in a deal expected to close in the second quarter. IAC shareholders will receive a proportionate amount of Vimeo stock, the company said.<br />Vimeo has seen a surge of revenue as businesses rely more on the internet to reach customers during the coronavirus pandemic. December marked its highest month of revenue growth, increasing 57% year over year, IAC said.</td>

      <td>China’s President sweet-talks liberal leaders as he threatens Taiwan.</td>
      <td>Chinese President Xi Jinping knows his audience. In his Monday address to the World Economic Forum, the annual meeting of global luminaries in Davos, Mr. Xi sounded like a liberal internationalist in good standing. He pulled out all the buzzwords that make Davosians swoon: “inclusive growth,” “green development,” “global governance” and “consensus building.”<br />The Davos website effused that this was a “historic opportunity for collaboration.” But Mr. Xi’s People’s Liberation Army told a different story over the weekend, menacing Taiwan with back-to-back military flyovers of more than a dozen planes. The provocation is a reminder that while the government has changed hands in Washington, it hasn’t in Beijing, which still sees extending sovereignty over Taiwan—possibly by force—as a priority.<br />Mr. Xi said in his speech that “the strong should not bully the weak,” but that admonition doesn’t seem to apply to his own government. “We should stay committed to international law and international rules, instead of seeking one’s own supremacy,” he added. Tell that to the people of Hong Kong who were promised autonomy through 2047 in a treaty Beijing signed with Britain but are now being arrested for even mild political dissent.<br />Judging from comments by Secretary of State nominee Tony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in their Senate hearings, the new Administration seems to recognize the importance of Taiwan’s independence and U.S. predominance in the Western Pacific.<br />Yet many in the Administration are also true believers in the types of global-governance values Mr. Xi claimed to endorse in his Davos speech, which they see as the best way to solve problems like climate change. Unlike Mr. Xi, they aren’t experienced in using those values as a shield to relentlessly push their own national interest.</td>

      <td>Even a federal bribe isn’t enough to get them back teaching in classrooms.</td>
      <td>The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) this weekend vetoed Joe Biden’s plan to reopen schools during his first 100 days by voting to continue remote learning indefinitely. The union is taking kids hostage to extract more money from Congress with no guarantee that it will release them if it does.<br />Chicago’s Board of Education had required K-8 teachers to show up at schools on Monday to prepare for a return to in-person instruction on Feb. 1. The union doesn’t care. Seventy-one percent of CTU voting members rejected a return to in-person learning until schools are “safe”—meaning whenever teachers feel like going back.<br />The district has installed air purifiers in classrooms, conducted ventilation tests, increased cleaning and procured rapid testing, among other things. It will begin vaccinating teachers next month. There’s no excuse for teachers not to return to classrooms.<br />“Students in over 130 private and parochial schools and over 2,000 early learning centers across the city have been safely learning in their classrooms since the fall, and we must provide that same option to our families who, through no fault of their own, have been unable to make remote learning work for their children,” Chicago Public Schools said. “We’ve seen grades, attendance, and enrollment drop significantly for many of our students in recent months, and the impact has been felt most by our Black and Latinx students.”<br />After the union vote, the district postponed teachers’ start-date until Wednesday to provide time “to resolve our discussions without risking disruption to student learning.” Haven’t district leaders read the children’s book “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie”? Accommodating unreasonable demands leads to more unreasonable demands.</td>

The man was beaten and cut with an unknown object, and suffered slashes to his head, torso and hand, the officials said. The suspects then took the man’s clothes and cell phone before fleeing in private vehicles, the officials said.<br />The victim, who is from Brooklyn, was transported to Manhattan’s Bellevue Hospital, where he was in stable condition.<br />A NYPD spokeswoman said Monday that investigators were still working to determine the motive of the suspects.

      <td>Spending packages need triggers to sustain aid when the recovery lags and cut it off when things improve.</td>
      <td>President Biden has proposed a bold and ambitious $1.9 trillion plan for economic recovery. The plan would benefit from one important change: It should be contingent on the pace of recovery. The Biden plan provides substantial support for the economy through the end of September but essentially ends on that date. It could be improved by including provisions that automatically continue assistance as long as the economy is weak and needs it. In exchange, these provisions could also phase out aid more quickly than Mr. Biden proposes if the economy rebounds faster than expected. Most important, this recession insurance should be made permanent to mitigate future recessions.<br />The economy is more than 11 million jobs short of where it should be, and important labor-market indicators have steadily worsened since the summer, including long-term unemployment and the number of unemployed workers not on temporary layoff. The supply-side constraints created by the virus are the biggest limit on the economy. Aggressive deployment of vaccines plus testing and other measures will likely solve the supply problem over the coming months.<br />A full recovery will require more than open restaurants. People must also be able to afford to eat in those restaurants. That’s where the demand side comes in: The Biden plan would provide relief for many of the households that need it most, including low-income families and the unemployed, turbocharging demand to meet the expanded supply.<br />Covid has had an unprecedented impact on both supply and demand. Anyone who ventures a confident prediction about the course of jobs, inflation or any other aspect of the economy may be wrong and is certainly wrong to be confident.<br />The pace and magnitude of virus mutations raise the concern that the virus will become immune to current vaccines. The ossification of unemployment could make the last phases of the recovery slower and more painful as people are unable to return to their old jobs quickly and may need to find new ones in different industries. Global events could disrupt the U.S. economy. For all of these reasons more rescue and relief may be needed long after September.</td>

      <td>In the race to vaccinate people for Covid-19, everyone agrees front-line health workers, the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions should get priority. But one vital group is being overlooked. Even worse, some are criticizing efforts to vaccinate them as some sort of effort to “cut the line.”<br />I’m referring to the thousands of people working to produce critical vaccines, medications and diagnostics for Covid-19. In addition to  Pfizer  and Moderna, my company,  Emergent BioSolutions ,  has been ramping up manufacturing of hundreds of millions of vaccine doses for partners like  Johnson & Johnson  and  AstraZeneca  in close coordination with the federal government.<br />Emergent’s employees are essential to the Covid-19 response, and we have gone to extraordinary lengths to protect them. Unfortunately, our strict safety protocols, like the use of personal protective equipment, disinfection of work areas and regular testing, are no guarantee against infection.<br />Over the past year, we have quarantined hundreds of team members—nearly one-third of our small on-site workforce. Some were exposed outside the workplace, but the primary cause of quarantine is potential exposure to an infected fellow employee. This situation puts a tremendous strain on our 24/7 operations. Absenteeism means other employees have to work multiple back-to-back shifts to avoid a manufacturing shutdown. So far, we’ve avoided delays in vaccine production, but the risk is real—we briefly had to slow down operations at another facility because of Covid-related absenteeism.<br />This situation also can create a national-security risk. In addition to Covid-19 vaccines, Emergent produces medical countermeasures for deadly threats like anthrax, botulism and smallpox. This manufacturing can’t simply be turned on and off. That’s why the Department of Homeland Security has designated Emergent as a part of America’s critical national-security infrastructure in cases of emergency.</td>

I fear the work of four decades won’t survive the coming months without a plan that truly addresses my industry’s needs.<br />In April I sat down with my wife, 22-year-old daughter and 18-year-old son and told them we may lose some, or all, of the six restaurants and two bars we owned. In the same conversation, I told them there was also a strong chance we might have to sell our home.<br />Nearly a year into the pandemic, I have permanently closed two restaurants and a bar—leaving 52 people to have difficult conversations with their own families. For the first time in my career, I have to ask for help.<br />The pandemic is unfair. A tiny airborne particle threatens everything I’ve spent 40 years working to build. My teams have done nothing wrong. We work hard, we’re honest, we roll with the punches, and we always do our best to serve our customers and community.</td>

      <td>Nations decide which problems to solve through politics. Global elites already know what problems need solving. Just ask them.</td>
      <td>Refugee Run is an immersive theatrical experience at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which billionaires and other global elites pretend to be refugees for a little over an hour. In one promotional video, corporate executives wearing $1,000 loafers “escape” their “village” and make their way to a “refugee camp,” where they must “bribe” actors playing camp guards. Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg flashes on-screen to attest: “I found it incredible . . . that you can put yourself in a room like this and feel as much as you feel.” This focus on eliciting emotional responses from the wealthy and powerful at an Alpine ski resort, rather than providing material assistance to actual refugees, makes Refugee Run an appropriate charity for the Davos set.<br />The founder and executive chairman of the Davos forum is Klaus Schwab, a German engineer and former academic. Mr. Schwab is a prominent evangelist for the virtues of “stakeholder capitalism,” the belief that corporations answer notjust to shareholders—that’s ordinary capitalism—but to communities, marginalized minorities and society in general. This vision for capitalism has steadily become the dominant philosophy among Western business elites and even some Republicans.<br />Mr. Schwab argues in “Stakeholder Capitalism: A Global Economy That Works for Progress, People and Planet” that to make the world a better place captains of industry must work together to solve global problems. “Building such a virtuous economic system is not a utopian ideal,” he writes. “Most people want to do good. But what’s been missing in recent decades is a clear compass to guide those in leading positions in our society and economy.” Mr. Schwab believes that he possesses such a compass.<br />Unfortunately, his compass points in multiple directions. In lieu of mere profit, Schwab argues that businesses should pursue the four P’s: Principles of Governance, Planet, People and Prosperity. He offers no guiding principle for how these vague, expansive and competing interests ought to be weighed and weighted.<br />Like other stakeholder proponents, Mr. Schwab cherry-picks examples to support his claim that shareholder capitalism is somehow ignoble or prone to disaster rather than deriving his claims from the totality of available examples. He predictably invokes Enron but fails to mention Volkswagen, Wirecard or Wells Fargo—examples of large-scale fraud perpetuated by executives who long escaped scrutiny in part by ostentatiously championing fashionable social causes.</td>

      <td>California wants to do it, and Biden wants to help—even though it will violate the law and cost us all.</td>
      <td>President Biden can’t mandate that we all drive electric cars, but he’s opening the gates to an electric Trojan horse. In a day-one executive order, Mr. Biden began the process of rescinding a Trump administration rule, the first step toward greenlighting California’s electric car agenda. California and like-minded states plan to impose electric cars through production quotas—whether drivers want the cars or not.<br />California regulators call it a “zero-emissions vehicle” standard, but green propaganda shouldn’t obscure what’s really going on. Start with federal law. It requires the transportation secretary to set national average fuel-economy performance standards for car makers at the “maximum feasible” level without restricting consumer choice. Instead of mandating a given technology, federal fuel-economy standards allow car makers the freedom to decide how best to improve fuel economy at the lowest cost.<br />To promote efficiency, federal law broadly forbids state regulations “related to fuel economy standards.” Courts have held that this law forbids electric car quotas and similarly meddlesome command-and-control policies that seek to dictate how car makers should meet federal performance standards. The Golden State argues that a special exception made for California regulations in the Clean Air Act should also be read into the federal fuel-economy law. But that law’s text says no. It forbids fuel-economy regulation by any state—no exceptions.<br />Next, the policy. Congress pre-empted state laws in 1975 because sprinkling policies like state electric car quotas on top of federal fuel-economy standards makes no sense. An electric car quota in California would force car makers to meet national fuel-economy standards using one of the most expensive fuel-efficiency technologies, undermining consumer choice and increasing costs. One study from 2019 estimates that state electric car quotas will cost an extra $400 for every new car nationwide by 2025.<br />Those costs won’t be distributed equally. The zero-emission vehicle standard is in effect a hidden regressive tax paid by ordinary car buyers to subsidize luxury cars for the wealthy. It takes $400 from the wallets of low- and moderate-income car buyers and hands it over primarily to six-figure-income electric car buyers, who enjoy many other subsidies, too.</td>

Jane and Naudline Pierre and is associated with MoMA PS1’s multiyear partnership with Harlem’s Studio Museum) is promoted as presenting “the intersection between queerness and Blackness as a waypoint to yearn from, reach toward and leap beyond.”<br />For his part, Mr. Reed offers a gallery with two high-gloss aluminum signs, one emblazoned with the word “BLOOD,” the other with “NUDITY”; an empty track suit laid out on a bed of salt; and a five-screen video display with Mr. Reed at its center, flanked by the four musicians of the JACK string quartet. Mr. Reed gesticulates and recites a text, which can be read in full at mo.ma/elliotreed, in which he muses on both contemporary and historical criminal acts targeting Black victims—a “real-life horror story.” The musicians take their cues from some of Mr. Reed’s readings. And now, as launched on Saturday and continuing on Feb. 6, Feb. 20 and March 6, Mr. Reed is presenting a series of “Duets” in PS1’s converted school building, in places inaccessible to museum visitors.<br />Each excursion, streamed to video screens in the museum and on MoMA’s website, as well as to PS1’s Instagram account, will have Mr. Reed and an invited artist improvise an hour-long performance aimed at, according to MoMA’s online calendar, “reinterpreting COVID-19 precautions as a formal challenge.” In the first, Mr. Reed was joined by dancer-choreographer Raymond Pinto. The Feb. 6 duet will include choreographer Ishmael Houston-Jones; the one on Feb. 20, performance artist Ron Athey; and the final one a collaborator still to be decided.<br />The initial performance unfolded as gently poetic rather than strongly polemical. Except for passing references to asbestos and mesothelioma as Mr. Pinto and Mr. Reed maneuvered together under some insulated pipes of the museum’s furnace room, their duet was a mostly playful one in which the two men, in janitor-style coveralls explored their confines and exchanged thoughts while maintaining social distance in the lower reaches of PS1.</td>

In the letter, a copy of which was viewed by the Journal, Mr. Black detailed other governance changes he is recommending to the board, including the appointment of more independent directors and the elimination of Apollo’s dual-class share structure.<br />Mr. Black also pledged to donate $200 million of his family’s money to women’s initiatives.</td>

Unlike some of their ’90s peers, Foo Fighters has never embarrassed itself—there have been no ill-advised genre exercises à la Weezer, no indulgent multi-disc concept albums à la the Smashing Pumpkins.

Established and insurgent parties are struggling over Europe’s future, stable majorities are often elusive and leaders are searching for ways to overcome long-term economic underperformance—nowhere more so than in Italy.<br />Rome’s latest political breakdown is likely to cause concern in the capitals of Europe’s stronger economies, such as Germany, which last year agreed to underwrite a massive European Union investment plan for economic recovery from the coronavirus.<br />Italy, due to receive more than €200 billion in EU funds, the equivalent of about $243 billion, is the plan’s biggest beneficiary. But Italian leaders’ inability to agree on a coherent economic strategy reduces the chances that the EU’s third-biggest economy will use the funds effectively.<br />At stake is not just Italy’s chances of escaping from its long economic decline, and of stabilizing its sky-high national debt, but also the political trust between northern and southern Europe that the euro needs for its long-term viability.</td>

Among other short positions, Melvin bet against the surging stock of videogame retailer  GameStop  Corp.<br />Citadel and its partners are investing $2 billion and Point72, which already had more than $1 billion invested in Melvin as of 2019, $750 million. The investments are in Melvin’s fund and include non-controlling revenue shares in the firm. Melvin founder Gabe Plotkin was a top portfolio manager at Point72’s predecessor firm, SAC Capital Management, before he left to start Melvin.<br />It couldn’t be determined how much of a revenue share Citadel and Point72 would get.<br />Melvin had been down about 15% for the year through late last week—but heavily shorted stocks soared Friday.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s  basket of the 50 stocks with the highest short interest as a share of market capitalization soared Friday, bringing its gains for the year to 25%. In comparison, the S&P 500 had gained 2.4% for the period. Unlike many other hedge funds, Melvin has an expansive and aggressive short book.</td>

      <td>Moderna Inc.  said its Covid-19 vaccine appeared to protect against emerging variants of the coronavirus in laboratory tests, but as a precaution it would test whether a booster shot improves immune responses and develop a new vaccine targeting the strain first identified in South Africa.<br />The company said Monday its vaccine produced immune-system agents known as neutralizing antibodies that worked against the emerging virus variants tested, including strains first evident in the U.K. and South Africa.<br />That means the Moderna vaccine likely still protects against the emerging strains, but a weaker response to the South Africa variant suggests the hazards of a virus that could mutate in significant ways while countries race to vaccinate against it.<br />The new strains appear to spread more easily from person to person, and there are signs that the U.K. variant is more deadly than earlier forms of the virus. The strains appear to be spreading around the world, prompting U.S. health authorities to warn the variant first detected in the U.K. could become dominant by March.<br />The variant first found in South Africa hasn’t been detected in the U.S., Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top-infectious disease expert, said Sunday. To curb the spread of new strains into the U.S., President Biden on Monday restricted travel from South Africa and re-established a ban on most travel into the U.S. from Europe, the U.K. and Brazil.</td>

Mining that vein has paid off in a new way for the 68-year-old action star during the pandemic. He has scored two No. 1 movies in the last three months, by supplying multiplexes with much-needed new releases and audiences willing to turn out for his brand of movie.<br />“Maybe these stories hark back to a simpler time of a man taking on evil people in a very basic, fundamental fashion,” Mr. Neeson said in an email.<br />In “The Marksman,” released Jan. 15, he stars as a hardscrabble Arizona rancher who protects a boy who crosses the border illegally with his mother to escape a Mexican crime cartel. Ticket sales were strongest in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Florida and Texas. The film, made for about $30 million, is now in its second week as the highest grossing movie, with total ticket sales of $6.1 million—in the one-third of domestic theaters currently open. A similar pattern played out in October (when more theaters were open) for the release of “Honest Thief,” featuring Mr. Neeson as a bank robber double-crossed by FBI agents. The movie grossed about $14 million domestically.<br /><br /></td>

The Wall Street Journal also reported that Mr. Trump pushed the Justice Department to ask the Supreme Court to invalidate Mr. Biden’s win.<br />Inspector General Michael Horowitz said in a statement that his office will probe “whether any former or current DOJ official engaged in an improper attempt to have DOJ seek to alter the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election,” adding only that the investigation will “encompass all allegations that may arise that are within the scope” of its jurisdiction.<br />Mr. Trump’s persistent efforts to involve the Justice Department in his attempts to undo the outcome of the November election failed due to pushback from his own appointees in the department, people familiar with the matter have said. The efforts have drawn sharp rebuke from Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), who announced Saturday that the Senate Judiciary Committee has initiated its own review of Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign at the Justice Department.<br />As part of that effort, Mr. Trump explored a plan to replace then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen with another senior Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, an ally who had expressed a willingness to use the department’s power to help the former president continue his unsuccessful legal battles contesting the election results, people familiar with the matter said.</td>

Sen. Pat Toomey, a spending hawk from Pennsylvania, also said he won’t run again.<br />The Senate is currently split 50-50, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tiebreaking vote.</td>

      <td>Facebook and Twitter can afford armies of lawyers to defend against liability.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump and other politicians have called on Congress numerous times to revoke Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. During the lame-duck congress, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even introduced a bill tying increased stimulus payments to the repeal of Section 230.<br />They’re rightly concerned about political bias and censorship by social-media companies. A 2020 survey by Pew Research found that 75% of Americans (including most conservatives and liberals alike) believe  Facebook  and  Twitter  censor political views. It is clear that social media must change before it destroys free speech, privacy and democracy. The problem is that revoking Section 230 would exacerbate censorship and reduce the competition that is the real solution.<br />I’m CEO of MeWe, a social network that competes directly with Facebook. We have millions of members, people of all political persuasions. Revoking Section 230 would significantly harm smaller companies like mine and new startups that compete with the tech giants.<br />Enacted in 1996, Section 230 is the legislation that protects social media and web companies, big or small, from liability for content posted by users. The law makes it possible for modestly funded or self-funded startups to enter the market and compete with bigger companies. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has called it “the most important law protecting internet speech.”<br />Those who want to get rid of Section 230 say this would stop social networks and websites from unfairly censoring their users’ political comments. In reality, it would give them an incentive to censor far more aggressively. To protect themselves from being sued over content, they would remove anything remotely controversial. Users would be spied on constantly.</td>

      <td>Of all the big questions hanging over the early days of President Biden’s administration, none looms larger than this: Can he hold the political center, or will he be pulled away from it toward the left?<br />In his first week, the evidence is mixed. The safest conclusion to draw is that it is too early to draw a conclusion.<br />Mr. Biden, of course, campaigned as a centrist in a party that generally has moved to the left. “Biden won the nomination because he’s a moderate, not despite it,” says Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, an organization of centrist Democrats. “And he won the election as a moderate.”<br />Some Republicans, though, argue that Mr. Biden already has abandoned that center ground in his early actions and initiatives. “Some of these are far left-of-center ideas,” asserted Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida on Fox News Sunday. “He may use the language, the rhetoric, even the demeanor of a centrist, but so far his policies don’t seem to represent that.”<br />As evidence, Republicans cite Mr. Biden’s unprecedented burst of executive orders reversing Trump administration policies, including on immigration, gender identity in schools and transgender people in the military; the hefty $1.9 trillion price tag on his proposed coronavirus aid and stimulus plan; his inclusion of a $15 minimum wage proposal within that plan; his immediate decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada’s oil-sands region; and his appointment of some aggressive financial regulators.</td>

      <td>John F. Cogan and John B. Taylor (“Those $2,000 Checks Won’t Boost the Economy,” op-ed, Jan. 15) are correct to note that much of this deficit spending will be saved, not spent. This is what we should expect when checks go to households with twice the median income. If spending is humanitarian aid for those who suffer most from the pandemic, it makes more sense to send checks only to households with incomes below the median or to people who have been unemployed for more than some number of months; the longer the period of unemployment, the larger the check.<br />Messrs. Cogan and Taylor also are correct in noting that the Cares Act did nothing to stimulate economic growth. This isn’t surprising. Economists know that fiscal and monetary policy actions can’t increase an economy’s growth rate.<br />Economic growth is determined by the growth rates of labor, real capital and productivity. The growth rate of labor is determined by immigration and the labor-force participation rate. The latter trended up until about 2000 when it began trending down. Investing in plant and equipment happens because investors expect very high rates of return. They won’t invest less because the borrowing rate is 8% rather than 5%, nor will they invest more if the borrowing rate drops from 5% to 2%. Productivity is driven by technology, which is why there was a decadelong increase in productivity growth that began in the mid-1990s.<br />The Cares Act wasn’t entirely humanitarian aid and didn’t stimulate growth.

      <td>In “No, You Can’t Try an Impeached Former President” (op-ed, Jan. 21), Prof. Alan Dershowitz makes some technical arguments against the ability of the Senate to hold an impeachment trial against now former-President Trump. Fair enough, but when he discusses precedents, which are very rare, his attempt fails when he frames the nonimpeachment of Richard Nixon, who “left office in 1974 to avoid certain impeachment and conviction, there was no movement to continue the process.”<br />Though the Nixon episode is similar to President Trump’s, it is hardly a precedent. The glaring difference is that Nixon resigned the presidency, rather than face, and put the country through, the ordeal of impeachment. President Trump adamantly refused to resign the presidency, or even to concede the election. Had President Trump resigned, as Nixon did, the House likely wouldn’t have pursued impeachment.<br />Finally, Mr. Dershowitz states that: “For the victorious Democrats to seek revenge against Donald Trump would set a terrible precedent.” In this case, there are many in Congress from both parties who have a much different perspective than ours, having experienced the violence on Jan. 6. Even if the Senate doesn’t have a trial now that Mr. Trump is no longer in office, he should at minimum be censured for his goading the mob violence that day.<br />Russell Bratburd<br />Pleasant Hill, Calif.</td>

Large parts of it depend on services, including travel and tourism, especially in the less-affluent south.<br />The European Commission, the European Union’s executive body, which procures vaccines centrally for the bloc, has ordered 2.3 billion doses from six manufacturers. It says most of these are expected to be delivered in 2021, and that member states should be able to vaccinate 70% of adults among the bloc’s 448 million inhabitants by the summer.<br />But delivery delays and manufacturing hiccups by two large manufacturers threaten this plan, as does uncertainty about when other vaccines the EU is relying on will be approved. Meantime, governments in the region are struggling to bring down case numbers and deaths despite tight restrictions on the population.<br />Ten days ago,  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ,  which have sold 600 million doses of their vaccine to the EU, making them the continent’s largest provider, said they would temporarily reduce deliveries in the bloc because of an upgrade to their plant in Belgium, though they promised to deliver all the doses owed in the first quarter.</td>

      <td>The House impeached Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection, and a Senate trial is expected to begin on Feb. 8</td>
      <td>The House of Representatives impeached then President Donald Trump a second time, for his role in inciting the capitol riots on Jan. 6, just over a year after it first impeached him for pressing Ukraine to announce investigations that would have aided him politically. The vote was 232 to 197, with all Democrats joined by 10 Republicans, in a House chamber guarded by National Guard troops stationed throughout the Capitol and its grounds.<br />Speaker Nancy Pelosi was set to send over the article of impeachment to the Senate on Monday evening, triggering the start of the impeachment trial. While senators will be sworn in as jurors this week, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have agreed to start the trial the week of Feb. 8 to allow both sides more time to prepare. Mr. Trump has hired at least one lawyer to defend him, South Carolina-based attorney Butch Bowers, while Mrs. Pelosi has named a team of House impeachment managers. Here’s how the unprecedented process is playing out.<br />The Constitution gives broad leeway to the House of Representatives to handle the impeachment process. There are no limits on the number of times someone may be impeached, though Mr. Trump is the first person ever to be impeached more than once.<br />Because President Biden has already taken office, the practical effects of the second impeachment by the House are mostly symbolic. The Senate, if it successfully convicts Mr. Trump, can’t remove him from an office he doesn’t hold.<br />But the Senate could immediately hold a follow-up vote, subject only to a simple majority, to ban Mr. Trump—who has weighed another presidential run in 2024—from ever seeking office again. Those are the only punishments the Senate can consider as part of an impeachment conviction. A Senate conviction after Mr. Trump has left office wouldn’t affect his postpresidential benefits, which include a pension and Secret Service protection.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden has tapped Dr. Kevin O’Connor to serve as White House physician, succeeding Dr. Sean Conley in a role that generated controversy under former President Donald Trump.<br />A White House official confirmed the appointment and cited Dr. O’Connor’s personal relationship with Mr. Biden, who at 78 years old is the oldest president to take office. Dr. O’Connor was Mr. Biden’s physician during his time as vice president and prepared his medical report during the 2020 campaign, declaring the then-candidate “healthy” and “vigorous.”<br />It isn’t uncommon for new presidents to choose their own physicians, although Mr. Trump initially retained Dr. Ronny Jackson, a Navy rear admiral who served in the role under former President Barack Obama. A White House physician is typically responsible for the medical care of the president, the first family and White House staff.<br />Although the position is typically low-profile, both Dr. Jackson and Dr. Conley drew scrutiny for what some said were overly rosy assessments of Mr. Trump’s health. Dr. Conley also faced criticism for providing conflicting information about Mr. Trump’s condition when he was diagnosed with coronavirus in the fall.<br />Dr. Jackson was subsequently nominated by Mr. Trump to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, but he withdrew from consideration amid allegations of misconduct while serving as the president’s personal physician. Dr. Jackson, who has remained a close Trump ally, was elected to Congress in November as a Texas Republican.</td>

The disclosures, which are dated Jan. 22, showed Mr. Walsh had assets such as holdings in stock and bond funds, life insurance policies and bank accounts valued at between $350,000 and $950,000. The disclosure forms use ranges rather than specific amounts.<br />The forms showed Mr. Walsh had between $500,000 and $1 million in liabilities from two mortgage loans on a personal residence.<br />The government disclosures show Mr. Walsh is participating in two retirement plans through unions that would make him eligible for payments of a combined $1,998 a month starting at age 60. Mr. Walsh is also participating in a retirement plan through the city of Boston that would make him eligible for monthly payments of $9,769.17 a month starting at age 65. The value of the retirement accounts was “not readily ascertainable,” according to the disclosures.<br />Before serving as mayor, Mr. Walsh led the Greater Boston Building Trades Unions, an umbrella organization comprised of 20 local construction unions, and was president of Laborers Local Union 223. Those organizations fall under the AFL-CIO federation of labor unions, and its leader, Richard Trumka, advocated for Mr. Walsh’s nomination to become labor secretary.</td>

      <td>WHEN ALL THIS is over, will we leave the sweatpants behind? Will we burn our Zoom shirts? Will we remember again how to tie a tie?<br />With Covid cases still spreading amid an uneven vaccine rollout, it might feel premature to ponder questions about how we’ll dress in the “after times.” Yet this month European fashion brands and designers did just that by presenting their fall 2021 men’s runway collections (in a mostly digital, audience-free manner). Fashion shows have always gazed toward the future, serving up novelties that won’t trickle into stores for months and months. These particular clothes should land sometime around September or October and, in various ways, suggest what we might be wearing this fall.<br />To begin with, they posit that we’re unlikely to cast aside the comfortable loungewear of quarantine. Designers seemed soberly aware that many of their customers have been living in soft pants and slouchy, couch-potato hoodies for most of 2020.<br />In Prada’s presentation, you could see the potent influence of at-home wear in the knit long johns the models wore beneath their outfits. In some cases, the long johns comprised the entire outfit—the models evocative of successful 20-something Twitch streamers, dressed for a rousing day of video games. Or even kids scurrying downstairs in patterned footie PJs to watch Saturday-morning cartoons.<br />Other brands strove for a more balanced, present-meets-future mix—imbuing relatively traditional garments with an easy, at-home feel. Parisian label Lemaire showed a serene array of slouchy, earth-toned dress shirts, trousers and even sportcoats in delicate fabrics that suggested pajamas. The models in the video presentation were hardly couch-bound though: They marched about with purpose, reminding us that someday soon we’ll all have in-person meetings to hurry into again.</td>

Mr. Ryu’s defection in 2019 occurred just two months after Pyongyang’s acting ambassador to Rome, Jo Song Gil, defected to Seoul.<br />The number of recent ambassador-level defections from North Korea shows Kim Jong Un’s control over the regime’s bureaucracy may not be as strong as his father’s or grandfather’s, said Cheon Seong-whun, a former South Korean national security official. However, he cautioned against reading too much into the defections as a sign of the regime’s fragility.<br />“We should be wary of interpreting the series of defections as a sign of weakness of the Kim Jong Un regime,” Mr. Cheon said. Most North Koreans have a tendency to rally around their leader against outside pressure, he said.</td>

      <td>Charts show the U.K. economy came into the coronavirus pandemic weaker than its peers after years of uncertainty over Brexit. Then, it was hurt more by shutdowns because of its dependence on recreational spending for growth.</td>
      <td>The U.K.’s economy shrank more last year than any of the G-7, in what the Bank of England says will be the country’s biggest economic slump in more than 300 years.<br />What went wrong? Shutdowns caused greater pain for the U.K. than other members of the Group of Seven advanced economies in part because it is especially dependent on consumer spending, which evaporated amid one of Europe’s deadliest Covid-19 outbreaks. The economy was already weak after the four years of negotiations over Britain’s exit from the European Union, during which business investment sagged and households held back on spending.<br />This is the starting point for Britain’s new relationship with the EU, which began Jan. 1 with a loose free-trade agreement. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced another nationwide lockdown to fight a new, more-contagious variant of the coronavirus. That puts the U.K. economy on course to shrink again in the first quarter of the year, when businesses must also get to grips with new European trading arrangements.<br />Growth in the U.K. was already weak going into the pandemic because of feeble business investment, poor productivity and scant growth in incomes. Once the coronavirus set in, the British economy shrank by more than its peers in the G-7 in the first nine months of the year. Figures for the final quarter, due Feb. 12, are expected to show the economy contracted again.<br />The U.K. took a bigger hit because around 13% of its annual gross domestic product comes from spending on recreation and culture and in restaurants and hotels, a higher share than any other G-7 country. Businesses that depend on direct contact with consumers—bars and restaurants, sports events, hotels and theaters, cinemas and museums—were hobbled when social distancing became the norm and when the spread of the virus forced them to close. The current lockdown, in place through mid-February, closes schools and nonessential shops, and people have been told to leave home only if necessary.</td>

They didn’t go for it on fourth down.<br />The Packers were down by eight points and gave up a shot at eight points to take three points. Instead, they never got the ball back. They lost.

The Kansas City Chiefs are the AFC champions because they did, too.<br />It’s a testament to how quickly one of the biggest decisions in football has evolved. Going for it on fourth down used to be a matter of gumption or necessity. Teams that went for it were bold. Or they were behind and had to. The ones that strayed from that script were brash.<br />Now going for it differentiates something else about teams: whether or not they’re making an analytically correct choice.

Negotiations are continuing between victims’ lawyers and the Boy Scouts, which has said it needs a settlement approved by early summer to survive.<br />Mass-tort cases, which involve dangerous products or, in the Boy Scouts’ case, allegations of sexual abuse, have become a big business. Behind every case are marketers, brokers, funders and other third parties that help accumulate claims and pass them off to lawyers.

      <td>Google is pushing forward with its plan to remove a widely used tracking technology from its Chrome web browser, despite complaints from rivals that rely on it to target ads at individuals.<br />The  Alphabet Inc.  unit on Monday said that it is making progress on what it said are privacy-friendly alternatives that could replace third-party cookies, which many advertisers and other companies use to track individuals’ browsing habits across multiple websites.<br />Google cited positive test results for a technology that analyzes users’ browsing habits on their own devices, without sending sensitive data to central servers. A Google spokesman said such results mean the company is still on track to stop supporting such cookies in Chrome next year, when the new alternatives are expected to be ready.<br />Third-party cookies offer data that can be valuable to advertisers for the purpose of targeting ads, measuring their effectiveness and stopping fraud. But the way they track individuals’ personal browsing has long raised privacy concerns, leading Google to say last year that it would phase them out in 2022.<br />Chrome is the most widely used web browser, with more than 60% of the market globally, according to Statcounter.</td>

Benchmark Senior Living LLC, an operator of assisted-living facilities, is blasting “myth-buster” emails to its workforce and turning on-site vaccination clinics into mini parties, complete with cake and games, to lend a celebratory air. Technology company  VMware Inc.,  meanwhile, is discussing bringing in doctors to answer staff questions about the vaccine in virtual company meetings.<br />Many companies have taken on a stepped-up role in disseminating public-health information to employees during the pandemic. It is unusual terrain for bosses, but surveys have found that people often view their employers as more credible sources of information than government, social media or media outlets.<br />Getting a critical mass of employees vaccinated is crucial to reopening offices and returning workplaces to a semblance of normal, executives say. Yet overcoming vaccine skepticism could prove tough. A recent Siena College Research Institute survey of New York state residents found more than a quarter said they don’t plan to get the shot.</td>

Andrew Cuomo’s $193 billion budget.<br />Aides to the Democratic governor say the proposal could generate an additional $10 million for the state in the fiscal year that starts April 1, and $18 million in subsequent years. Roughly the same amount of money would also flow to local governments around the state, which also levy their own surcharges on top of the state’s 4% sales tax.<br />The proposal was embraced by the group representing the state’s county governments, but it could revive a broader debate about how home-sharing companies are regulated in the state, lawmakers said, which is fueled by different concerns in different parts of the state.<br />“I think it’s now opportune for us to have this larger conversation,” said state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat from Orange County, who favors changing state law to allow for short-term rentals in multifamily buildings.<br />Mr. Cuomo’s proposal doesn’t address registration or change the state’s multiple-dwelling law, which prevents someone from renting an apartment in a building with three or more units for fewer than 30 days unless the apartment’s tenant is also present.</td>

Many people who learn they have tested positive wonder how long they will be contagious, what they should or shouldn’t do while quarantining and when they can expect to see symptoms abate.<br />We asked doctors for answers to questions about dealing with a positive Covid test.<br />How long will I be contagious?<br />The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 should isolate for 10 days starting at symptom onset. That means avoiding all contact with other people and not leaving home unless you need to go to a medical appointment. If you are asymptomatic and test positive and never develop symptoms, the isolation period should start on the day you took your diagnostic test. You are believed to no longer be contagious after 10 days if you have had no fever—and haven’t taken fever-reducing medication—for at least 24 hours and your symptoms are improving. The CDC recommends that immunocompromised patients and those with severe Covid-19 cases isolate for up to 20 days after symptoms appear.<br /></td>

The buying pressure has led money managers to switch out of substantial bets that the stock would fall, analysts said.<br />This resulted in a short squeeze, in which rising prices prompt investors to buy back shares they had sold short to cut their losses, pushing the stock higher still.</td>

      <td>Software giant’s results will reflect a big gaming quarter, though console shortage and margins complicate the story</td>
      <td>Microsoft ’s  videogame business has long involved a delicate dance of pleasing two very different crowds. The company gave a sharp reminder of that just ahead of its quarterly results announcement scheduled for Tuesday.<br />Microsoft announced a series of price changes for its Xbox Live service on Friday. The changes would have effectively doubled the annual rate for new subscribers while allowing existing ones to shift their memberships to the company’s Game Pass service at no extra charge. But a swift outcry from gamers caused the company to backtrack. Microsoft announced on Friday night that it will keep prices the same for Xbox Live Gold members. It even threw in a change that a paid subscription will no longer be required to play free-to-play games, such as the mega-popular Fortnite.<br />The original move seemed to please investors as much as it irked gamers. Microsoft’s share price rose Friday in what was an otherwise tough session for many tech stocks. Gaming was once derided on Wall Street as an expensive distraction for Microsoft. Some analysts even called on Satya Nadella to sell the business after he was named chief executive in early 2014.<br />But Microsoft has instead doubled down, continuing to update its Xbox consoles while investing more in the software and services side. Two of the largest corporate transactions completed under Mr. Nadella’s watch have involved gaming, including last year’s pickup of Bethesda Softworks for $7.5 billion.<br />The launch of the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles last November make this year a big one for Microsoft’s gaming business. The company’s gaming revenue totaled $11.4 billion for the fiscal year ended last June, and analysts are expecting a jump of 17% for the current fiscal year, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The segment’s revenue is expected to rise 26% year over year to $4.2 billion for the fiscal second quarter ended December.</td>

That has helped China to blunt calls for changes to its state-controlled economy, which other members say distort the market.<br />“For the foreseeable future, China will partake actively in WTO discussions and initiatives, without offering major concessions at the negotiating table,” said Harvard University law professor and trade expert Mark Wu.<br />Mr. Biden’s team has said that he would lift the U.S. blockade on judges but that the pandemic and U.S. economic recovery could take precedence over trade.</td>

      <td>Small-investor trading activity has stayed super hot in 2021, highlighting the opportunity for big banks to tap into a rare source of growth</td>
      <td>The rising tide of small-investor activity is lifting some very big boats.<br />The surge of everyday investor trading logged in 2020 is continuing into the new year. Analysts at Piper Sandler noted that off-exchange trading—which includes retail volume that goes through wholesale market makers—accounted for a record 48% of the market through the first 11 trading days of January. “We suspect retail trades are on a record pace in January to date,” the analysts wrote last Wednesday.<br />The explosion of market activity by investors of all flavors is one of the biggest trends in financials right now, and not just for digital upstarts such as Robinhood.  Morgan Stanley ,  having completed its acquisition of E*Trade, reported growth of roughly 900,000 net new self-directed accounts for the online broker from the second quarter to the fourth. The hope is that such an influx of new clients can over time boost growth across the bank’s wider wealth platform. Morgan Stanley’s overall wealth network generated $66 billion in net new assets over the fourth quarter.<br />Charles Schwab —now combined with TD Ameritrade—is regularly surpassing its fourth-quarter peak trading day of 7.8 million client trades, hit on Nov. 9. The daily January average through midmonth is running at over 8 million. Though trading might be mostly commission-free, investors are tapping those portfolios as a way of borrowing, for investing and other financing needs. Schwab reported a 16% uptick in average margin loan balances from the third quarter to the fourth. This helped boost net interest revenue and margin at a time when other banks are struggling to keep those numbers level.<br />Day-trader mania for hot stocks and initial public offerings surely plays some part in all of this. But shifts in the environment may be altering how even more sensible investors behave, especially with rates on deposits and money-market funds at remarkable lows.  BlackRock  this month said that growth in its exchange-traded fund business is being driven in part by the move to commission-free wealth management. Last year was a turning point for adoption of fixed-income ETFs, BlackRock said. It added that fixed-income products in its iShares ETF suite generated nearly $90 billion of inflows.</td>

      <td>Strong sales during the pandemic and the Senate flip are easing some of the sector’s old challenges</td>
      <td>The haze is finally clearing for U.S. pot companies.<br />Since Democrats won control of the Senate earlier this month, many in the cannabis industry are betting on a more rapid path to full federal legalization and a pickup in deal making as companies rush to scale up. The Global Cannabis Stock Index, which tracks U.S.-listed marijuana stocks, has climbed 35% since the start of this year.<br />Today’s high expectations look more justified than earlier speculative rallies that left pot investors badly burned. After almost doubling in value in 2017, the index was pummeled for two years as Canadian cannabis companies reported disappointing sales and profit numbers, and black-market dealers proved more resilient than expected.<br />This time, cannabis companies are performing well—particularly big U.S. growers with operations in multiple states. Pot sales have been strong during the pandemic as consumers have spent more time at home and received stimulus checks. In November, grower Cresco Labs reported its third consecutive quarter of revenue growth above 40%. Pot stores also won market share from illegal dealers by letting consumers order online and offering curbside pickup.<br />Progress on this score remains slow: An estimated 78% of U.S. sales still happened in the black market in 2020, according to the cannabis-focused SOJE Fund. States’ thirst for new sources of tax revenue amid the pandemic provides an extra incentive to increase the size of the legal sector. November ballots in Arizona, Montana, South Dakota and New Jersey all approved the legalization of adult use. New York is now weighing a similar move to plug a projected $15 billion budget hole in the current and coming fiscal years.</td>

      <td>Estimates that China will soon overtake the U.S. in total economic heft depend on it maintaining current growth trends, and poor demographics will make it difficult to hold the lead</td>
      <td>China’s relatively rapid recovery from the pandemic has prompted some accelerated predictions of when its economy will surpass that of the U.S. in size. That may be asking the wrong question—if China takes the top spot at all, it may struggle to keep it for long.<br />Researchers at investment bank Nomura recently suggested that if the yuan were to strengthen further and to hold at around 6 to the dollar, the U.S. economy would be eclipsed by the Chinese economy by 2026.<br />The estimate is based on extrapolating International Monetary Fund estimates of 7.9% nominal GDP growth in 2025 further out into the future, and depends on the assumption that the U.S. economy will remain permanently below its pre-pandemic path. Neither fact, nor continued currency appreciation, is certain. But even leaving the path of the U.S. aside, demographics and productivity trends will make sustaining China’s pre-pandemic growth rates increasingly difficult.<br />Even if fertility trends improved overnight, China’s 20-65 year old cohort will have shrunk in size by a 10th by the late 2030s. Sometime between 2035 and 2040, China’s old-age dependency ratio—the proportion of people older than 65 compared with the working-age population—will surpass the U.S. equivalent, according to United Nations projections.<br />The components of growth are labor, capital, and the elusive total factor productivity. The domestic working-age population, as discussed, will be contracting. That means that unless China manages to attract many more immigrants or dramatically boost labor-force participation, it will ultimately need to maintain growth with sustained productivity improvements. And that is precisely the element that will be most difficult.</td>

Her mother-in-law, a 67-year-old retired nurse, suffocated about 14 hours after the oxygen ran out, along with others in her ward, Ms. Rocha Lima said.<br />As Covid-19 cases increase sharply in much of the world, a scarcity of oxygen is forcing hospitals to ration it for patients and is driving up the coronavirus pandemic’s death toll. The problem is especially acute in the developing world, but has also hit hospitals in London and Los Angeles.<br />From Brazil to Zambia, overcrowded hospitals with too few resources are calling for emergency resupplies of oxygen. In Mexico and South Africa, people are stockpiling oxygen canisters to try to avoid overflowing Covid-19 wards, sending prices higher and making it harder for poorer families to rent tanks. In Mexico, armed bandits are stealing oxygen tanks.</td>

Meanwhile, Covid-19-related disruptions helped them to gain ground on foreign rivals like  Caterpillar Inc.  and Japan’s  Komatsu Ltd.  Exports have also started to recover sharply.<br />Sany Heavy’s stock in Shanghai has hit records, and as of Monday was up 171% over the past year, giving it a market value of more than $56 billion. Zoomlion’s Hong Kong shares recently hit highs last reached in 2013, and as of Friday the machinery subindex of China’s CSI 300 gauge was up 22% over the past month.<br />While China’s leaders have been seeking to cut the country’s reliance on debt-fueled investment, it has proven hard to reduce spending on property and infrastructure, particularly during times of economic stress. Analysts and investors expect the larger homegrown machinery companies to keep growing their domestic market share, while benefiting from robust customer demand to replace old equipment. In addition, many governments globally are counting on infrastructure spending to help their economies bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic, raising expectations for future international sales.</td>
