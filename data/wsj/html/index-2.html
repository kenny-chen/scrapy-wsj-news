      <td>Challenges include imprisonment of leader Lee Jae-yong and fiercer competition</td>
      <td>SEOUL— Samsung Electronics Co.  reported a 26% boost in its fourth-quarter net profit Thursday, as the world’s largest maker of smartphones and memory chips continues to ride sustained demand for its products amid the coronavirus pandemic.<br />But the South Korean tech giant faces extra challenges as it enters a new year. Beyond the pandemic, the company is contending with its de facto leader Lee Jae-yong being back behind bars. And its rivals, for handsets and semiconductors, are consolidating and getting larger.<br />Samsung posted 6.61 trillion South Korean won, or nearly $6 billion, in net profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31, over last year’s 5.23 trillion won. Revenue rose to 61.55 trillion won from the prior year’s 59.88 trillion won.<br />Analysts had forecast about 6.74 trillion won in net profit and 61.21 trillion won in revenue, according to estimates from S&P Global Market Intelligence.<br />Like other technology companies, Samsung has fared well in the pandemic on the strength of demand for most consumer electronics and displays, though economic pressures squeezed smartphone sales in the first half of last year. The company is closely watched in the technology world, as a major manufacturer of appliances and computing devices as well as a critical supplier to other electronics firms.</td>

A post from one of WallStreetBets’ moderators noted the team had struggled to keep up with the influx of comments and posts submitted to the forum in recent days.<br />WallStreetBets has been the subject of growing fascination and scrutiny as once-unpopular stocks ranging from GameStop Corp. to  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  have drawn significant interest from individual investors, helping catapult their share prices to eye-popping highs. Much of the discussion surrounding these shares has originated on WallStreetBets and then was amplified across the internet.</td>

      <td>Disappointing fourth-quarter earnings highlight the reality that Elon Musk’s car company will struggle to justify its valuation</td>
      <td>The furious rally in so-called Reddit stocks has captivated Wall Street and the general public. While the attention is elsewhere, a much more familiar mania is still worthy of investor scrutiny.<br />Tesla Inc.  reported fourth quarter sales of $10.7 billion and earnings of 24 cents a share on Wednesday, its fifth straight quarter of profits, according to generally accepted accounting principles. The car company also said it would increase production by at least 50% in 2021 from last year, when it delivered nearly half a million vehicles. Shares sold off after hours, but faithful Tesla shareholders barely felt a scratch: Buying the stock in May 2019 and holding on to it would have earned more than 22 times the initial investment.<br />That fact should alarm shareholders as much as it delights them: Tesla is sporting a market cap of $800 billion, which is more than seven times the combined sum of  Ford  and  General Motors .  That valuation is paired with a minuscule share of the global auto market. Faith in Chief Executive Elon Musk to work magic evidently goes a long way.<br />Granted, Tesla vehicles have proven to be enormously popular with Mr. Musk’s devoted fan base, and competition from established auto makers has been slow to roll out. Yet to assume ever-growing market share in perpetuity would be a mistake. Tesla had about 13% of total electric car market share in Western Europe last year, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. That lagged behind  Volkswagen  by about 10 percentage points.<br />Competitive concerns aside, the stock changed hands at 1,371 times trailing earnings as of Wednesday. Even that cartoonishly large multiple provides false comfort: In the fourth quarter, Tesla earned $270 million in net income but sold $401 million in regulatory credits to other auto makers needing to meet emissions mandates, primarily in Europe. Before tax, those revenues carry 100% profit margins. Tesla’s credit sales have significantly outpaced net income for five consecutive quarters, and those credits might become less valuable over time, as more manufacturers step up electric car production.</td>

      <td>American Financial to exit from the fixed and indexed annuity market</td>
      <td>American Financial Group Inc.  on Wednesday said it agreed to sell its annuity business to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. in a $3.5 billion cash deal.<br />The acquisition will deliver new ways for the giant Springfield, Mass., company, one of the nation’s oldest life insurers, to sell its products. MassMutual has long had one of the biggest fleets of career agents in the U.S., and the deal will add opportunities to sell through banks, independent broker dealers and independent agents, analysts said.<br />American Financial said the transaction will mark its exit from the market for fixed and indexed annuities, which are popular retirement products with conservative savers. It will focus more tightly on its property-and-casualty insurance operations.<br />The Cincinnati-based insurer is the latest U.S. insurer to divest annuity operations, as ultralow interest rates pressure companies’ abilities to earn healthy profits on the product line.<br />The transaction is the third life-insurance-industry transaction in a week and one of many over a decade of frenzied industrywide activity, as insurers have been narrowing their focus and divesting product lines, much of it motivated by the low interest-rate environment. Insurers invest customers’ premiums until needed to pay claims, so low rates make many products challenging to profitably sell.</td>

      <td>Tech stocks’ gyrations and several looming challenges left the social network’s investors unimpressed with a strong quarter and encouraging near-term trends.</td>
      <td>Investors who could pry themselves away from Reddit on Wednesday afternoon found  Facebook  much more soothing—the company’s results, that is.<br />The social-media giant reported monster fourth-quarter results. Total revenue grew by 33% year-over-year—well above Wall Street’s estimate—driven by advertising revenue growth of 31%. Given easy comparables as a result of the pandemic, the company said that it expects year-over-year growth rates to remain stable or to accelerate modestly in the first half of 2021. They will appear less flattering, however, in the second half of the year—a time when the company says it also could face pressure from ad targeting and regulatory headwinds.<br />Facebook has lagged behind the Nasdaq Composite Index and social-media competitors  Twitter ,   Snap Inc.  and Pinterest over the last year as such risks loomed. But the company should find relative shelter in its diversity. Analysts are expecting daily active users on the platform to continue to grow sequentially in the first quarter, alleviating some investors’ concerns of attrition following the platform’s January suspension of former President Donald Trump. That makes sense: Analysts forecast the U.S. and Canada will account for only about 10% of Facebook’s daily active users world-wide in the first quarter, according to Visible Alpha. Advertisers should continue to find superior value in Facebook’s platform relative to competitors.<br />Investors also have worried for months now about the revenue impact of  Apple ’s  impending iOS update, which will hamper advertisers’ ability to track users’ data in order to market themselves and monetize their ads on Facebook’s platform. But  Morgan Stanley ’s  Brian Nowak argues that Facebook’s breadth and differentiation will soften the blow. He estimates the iOS change would amount to just a 1% to 3% revenue loss in 2021 for Facebook, and he also notes that all platforms affected by Apple’s update will see their advertisers’ return on investment take a hit. Facebook, in other words, isn’t alone. Yet another concern is possible antitrust suits from regulators, but here Facebook also has company, and such suits can take years to play out.<br />Meanwhile, the fundamentals look promising: Truist’s Youssef Squali says Facebook’s more-than-8-million advertisers will help it “absorb some of the shock from negative externalities” such as the pandemic, future ad boycotts and regulatory and platform changes. Wall Street is expecting Facebook to grow ad revenue at an average pace of more than 29% year-over-year in the first and second quarter, according to FactSet, leaving room for upside based on the company’s guidance.</td>

      <td>Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s recently ascended leaders said Wednesday that the global casino operator’s future will hew closely to the vision of company founder Sheldon Adelson, who died earlier this month.<br />The company will continue to invest in its Singapore and Macau casinos, which generate most of the company’s revenue, and consider expansion opportunities in the U.S. in New York and Texas, company officials said on a call with Wall Street analysts Wednesday.<br />“The DNA of the company that Sheldon founded will be ever present,” said Sands Chief Executive Rob Goldstein, who was named Mr. Adelson’s successor this week.<br />Sands reported a 67% decline in revenue for the quarter that ended Dec. 31, the first such report since Mr. Adelson’s death. The casino magnate died Jan. 11 from complications of treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 87. The company began when Mr. Adelson and partners bought the old Sands Hotel casino on the Las Vegas Strip in 1989.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic has roiled the casino industry with temporary shutdowns, reduced travel and limited occupancies under social-distancing. Hopes for a recovery this year depend on how many tourists and business travelers will return as vaccines are distributed.</td>

Justice Department officials said the charge may be the first of its kind.<br />Douglass Mackey—whose alleged alias, Ricky Vaughn, was behind a highly trafficked alt-right Twitter account—is accused in a federal complaint in Brooklyn of working with others to design and distribute tweets telling people they could vote by texting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s name to a telephone code. Around Election Day 2016, at least 4,900 unique phone numbers texted Mrs. Clinton’s name or some derivative to a number provided by the alleged misinformation campaign, prosecutors said.<br />The criminal complaint charges Mr. Mackey with one count: conspiring to deprive people of their right to vote. Department of Justice officials described the charge as unusual, and a department spokesman said Mr. Mackey may be the first defendant to be charged with election-interference crimes stemming from social-media posts.<br />The complaint doesn’t identify Mrs. Clinton by name, referring to her instead as “the Candidate,” but a person familiar with the investigation confirmed it referred to the former senator and secretary of state.<br />Mr. Mackey, 31 years old, was arrested in Palm Beach on Wednesday and was released on $50,000 bond after an appearance in federal court in Florida. A court-appointed lawyer for Mr. Mackey declined to comment.</td>

      <td>Job losses in 2020 were far higher in states that loved lockdowns.</td>
      <td>Recall the political panic after the Labor Department reported 140,000 job losses in December? Well, the government’s state employment report released Tuesday shows those losses were largely related to state lockdowns, and jobs are rebounding rapidly in less restrictive states.<br />Despite the virus surge, employment increased in 15 states last month including Texas (64,200), Georgia (44,700), North Carolina (33,600), Wisconsin (15,100) and South Carolina (14,600). But these gains were more than offset by losses in Michigan (-64,400), California (-52,200), Minnesota (-49,800), Pennsylvania (-37,600) and New York (-37,200).<br />Democratic governors of the latter states shut down indoor dining (and outdoors in California), so not surprisingly nearly all of their job losses were in leisure and hospitality. Yet most states added jobs across industries, especially trade and transportation, and some including Georgia and Texas even added thousands in leisure and hospitality.<br />This underlines that the economy and jobs were recovering in most states before Congress passed its $900 billion relief bill and Joe Biden became President. The states that are struggling most imposed excessive business shutdowns, which didn’t control the virus any better than states that allowed business to operate with social distancing.<br />Note the nearby table that shows 10 states with the largest employment declines from December 2019 to December 2020: Hawaii (-13.8%) has suffered from unique tourism losses, but how do you explain Michigan (-10.9%), New York (-10.4%), Massachusetts (-9.1%) and the others if not by the degree of their lockdowns? Most lost jobs were in leisure and hospitality, as well as health care, education and manufacturing.</td>

      <td>His oil and gas drilling moratorium is an assault on school funding.</td>
      <td>President Biden wants to give states $130 billion more in Covid relief, but he may need more after Wednesday. The oil and gas lease moratorium on federal lands that he announced will erase thousands of blue-collar jobs—and billions of dollars in revenue that states use to fund education.<br />The feds split mineral royalties with the states, many of which rely on the revenue to balance their budgets. Some states also impose general receipts taxes on oil and gas production. Wyoming state superintendent Jillian Balow notes that her state depends on some $150 million a year in oil and gas federal royalties to fund K-12 schools.<br />A University of Wyoming study last month estimated that a federal leasing moratorium could cost states on average $1.6 billion annually in tax revenue. New Mexico ($946 million), Wyoming ($304 million), and North Dakota ($136 million) would be hit hardest, though Colorado, Alaska, Utah and Montana would also lose tens of millions of dollars.<br />Because state, private and federal lands are interspersed in a checkerboard pattern, as the study notes, Mr. Biden’s ban will effectively limit production on much private and state land too. Job losses will also reduce income and sales tax revenues.<br />Notably, Mr. Biden’s order exempts Native American tribal lands and says “The Secretary of the Interior shall engage with Tribal authorities regarding the development and management of renewable and conventional energy resources on Tribal lands.” States also have sovereign rights under the Constitution. Why isn’t the Administration engaging with them?</td>

      <td>Record-breaking quarter comes as stock has already reached a record high valuation</td>
      <td>$100 billion should feel better than this.<br />Apple Inc.  crossed that milestone by generating $111.4 billion in revenue during its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 26. That is not only a record for the tech giant, it was nearly 8% above Wall Street’s targets and represented a gain of 21% from the same period last year—Apple’s best growth rate in more than five years.<br />That growth can be credited to strength across the company’s product segments with the latest iPhone updates leading the way. Revenue for the smartphone line rose 17% from a year earlier to a record-high $65.5 billion. Service revenue jumped 24%, a notable acceleration from the midteens growth seen in the last several periods. And despite launching new iPhone designs packed with expensive 5G radio chips, Apple’s bottom line exploded. Operating income jumped 31% year over year to $33.5 billion, producing an operating margin above 30% for the first time since late 2015.<br />A stellar quarter, in other words, especially against the backdrop of a global pandemic that worsened significantly during the quarter. But investors seemed unimpressed: Apple’s share price slipped nearly 3% in after-hours trading following the results and conference call—one in which Apple continued to refrain from giving a forecast for the current quarter, citing continued uncertainty created by the continuing pandemic.<br />Part of the tepid reaction may be because of dynamics beyond Apple’s control, such as a newfound love among retail investors for beaten down names.  BlackBerry ,  the once-mighty smartphone maker that was nearly vanquished by the first iPhones, has seen its share price more than double in the past week. But Apple’s been a hot stock in its own right, with its shares surging 84% over the past 12 months. That has put them at a record-high multiple of around 35 times forward earnings. And the passing of the holiday quarter and iPhone launch naturally brings questions about what Apple might do next—an area the company is always  to discuss. So investors just have the most recent quarter to act on, and that blockbuster was already well priced in.</td>

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.<br />On Monday Mr. Schumer called for President Biden to declare a national climate emergency, which would give the new Administration sweeping authority to circumvent Congress. This echoes Donald Trump’s declaration of a phony immigration emergency in 2019 to divert money from other federal accounts to build his wall on the Southern border.<br />“Now, Trump used this emergency for a stupid wall, which wasn’t an emergency,” Mr. Schumer said on MSNBC. “But if there ever was an emergency, climate is one. So I would suggest that they explore looking at climate as an emergency, which would give them more flexibility.”<br />By “flexibility,” Mr. Schumer means unilateral power to redirect federal funds for climate projects and subsidies, block oil exports, suspend drilling projects and perhaps stop the transport of all fossil fuels. All of this would be illegal in our view without explicit Congressional approval, and would be challenged in court, but the “emergency” strategy has been emerging on the left for some time.<br />We warned Republicans that Democrats would cite Mr. Trump’s use of emergency powers as a precedent for their policies. And now here we are.</td>

The trial is set to begin in earnest in February, and Democrats would need support from at least 17 Republicans to convict Mr. Trump.<br />Tuesday’s vote showed it is “extremely unlikely that President Trump would be convicted,” Ms. Collins said. “It seems to me that there is some value in looking at an alternative to proceeding with the trial.” Ms. Collins was one of the handful of senators to side with Democrats in the vote.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) rejected the suggestion that the Senate should set aside the trial and said Wednesday that the Senate would proceed as planned. “Make no mistake—there will be a trial, and the evidence against the former president will be presented in living color,” he said. He said the constitutional objections to the trial were an attempt by Republicans to avoid having to cast judgment on Mr. Trump’s actions.<br />Mr. Trump’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</td>

      <td>The new president’s actions don’t suggest he’s interested in bipartisan progress.</td>
      <td>If America were diabetic, it would be suffering from hyperglycemia after the sugary coverage of President Biden’s first week.<br />Much praise was heaped on the new administration in opinion commentary and what passes for straight journalism nowadays. Mr. Biden was celebrated for beginning the “healing,” punching plenty of “reset buttons” and extending a much-needed “olive branch.”<br />His inaugural address was “grand and deeply intimate,” a “balm for a wounded nation.” Mr. Biden “met the challenge” simply by appearing at his swearing-in “at a moment of profound national vulnerability.” One veteran observer admitted it left him “in a bit of a swoon.” I’m sure it did.<br />It’s understandable that so many in the media hailed Mr. Biden’s ascension to the Oval Office. They loathed the person he replaced. But looking beyond the paeans, the new president is off to a soggy start, with too many discrepancies between declared intentions and subsequent actions.<br />Mr. Biden frequently calls for bipartisanship, but that will require his leadership. He will have to work with Republican leaders to find areas of agreement before surfacing legislation. On Covid-19 stimulus, the president did nothing of the sort. Instead, he laid out his initiative without consulting Republicans and included several provisions and a $1.9 trillion price tag he knew were unacceptable to GOP lawmakers. Now, rather than quickly passing a bipartisan bill that strengthens vaccinations and gives the new administration an early victory, we hear talk of Democrats ramming Covid relief through on a party-line vote using the reconciliation procedure.</td>

      <td>The losses from finding new servers will be dwarfed by the gains from all the free publicity.</td>
      <td>The coordinated actions of Big Tech against Parler, a free-speech competitor to  Twitter ,  have attracted much attention and debate. Some argue that deplatforming Parler was necessary to stop further violence after the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Others see political discrimination at work, given that  Facebook ,  YouTube and Twitter also host bad actors. Everyone seems to agree that the actions by Big Tech caused great harm to Parler.<br />On the contrary, there are strong economic reasons to think Parler will benefit in the long run. The value of the free publicity will ultimately far outweigh the loss of revenue from being shut down for a few weeks. Parler has become a household name. It was a company; now it’s a cause.<br />The attack on Parler follows a long history of incumbent monopolies trying to raise costs on new rivals. Once Parler gets new servers up, however, using a phone to sign up or log on through a browser rather than an app is a small barrier to entry. Many highly profitable websites have no apps.<br />The benefits to Parler from Big Tech’s actions come in the long haul. The value of any company stems from the present value of its future earnings. An investment raises this present value when the up-front cost is dwarfed by the gains in future earnings. Big Tech has made an implicit investment in Parler by imposing a short-run cost that is smaller than the more lasting future gain in earnings enabled by the free marketing campaign.<br />The growth in future users doesn’t have to be large to raise the value of Parler. It seems safe to assume that the number of users will be larger in March this year than it would have been without the Big Tech effort. And the growth doesn’t have to be huge to make a big difference. Losing 100% of a month’s earnings to switch servers is easily made up by a long-run gain of a few percentage points of monthly users afterward. Such a small gain seems more than likely given the multiples of 100% growth in Parler users after Twitter’s suppression of stories about Hunter Biden’s business dealings.</td>

      <td>The  New York Times  said it assigned a top editor to develop procedures to vet stories from its audio unit, a part of the business that is growing quickly but has drawn criticism recently over its “Caliphate” series.<br />Cliff Levy, who has been the news outlet’s Metro editor since 2018, was promoted to deputy managing editor. He will provide guidance on an interim basis to Sam Dolnick, who oversees the paper’s audio unit as well as its film and television projects, and executive audio producer Lisa Tobin.<br />Mr. Levy said in an interview that “bringing newsroom sensibilities” to the audio group is part of the reason for his new assignment. Addressing the problems related to the “Caliphate” series, which caused the Times to issue a major correction in December, “is one part,” he said.<br />The Times has made audio a focus in its digital expansion efforts, as podcasts grow in popularity with listeners and advertisers. U.S. ad spending on podcasts was up 14.7% in 2020 to nearly $1 billion, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.<br />The Times’s flagship podcast, “The Daily,” is regularly among the most-downloaded podcasts. The publisher doesn’t break out its audio unit’s financial results. The unit generated about $29 million in revenue in 2019, a person familiar with the matter said, about 11% of overall digital ad revenue that year. The revenue figure was earlier reported by Business Insider.</td>

      <td>‘The number of Americans who need to be deprogrammed is in the ‘millions.’’</td>
      <td>From a Jan. 26 New York Sun editorial:<br /><br />Following are the procedures for deprogramming The New York Sun. We offer them in light of Katie Couric’s swipe at Trump supporters. “The question,” she told Bill Maher, “is how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump.” The Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson reckons the number of Americans who need to be deprogrammed is in the “millions.” . . .<br />Step 1. Disconnecting the Republican solenoid. This device was installed after the Civil War by the Sun’s new proprietor, Charles Dana. Before the war, Dana had been fired from the Tribune by that jackanapes Horace Greeley, who’d endorsed Southern secession, to which Dana’d objected. Whereupon Dana got hired by Abe Lincoln to cover the war for one reader — the president. . . .<br />Step 2. Lifting out the gold core. This system of measuring value was installed in the 19th century, when William Jennings Bryan ran for president on a platform of inflation. . . . The Sun sided with gold.</td>

      <td>In the face of extinctions, a writer’s call to cherish the voices that make a symphony out of the natural world.</td>
      <td>For half a century, philosopher Kathleen Dean Moore has written about the natural world, her work shaped by the homes she’s made in Corvallis, Ore., and Chichaghof Island, Alaska. It’s also indebted to the conservationist and writer Rachel Carson (1907-1964), best known for “Silent Spring,” the landmark 1962 book in which she envisioned a world eerily hushed by pesticides. “I imagine,” Ms. Moore writes of Carson, “she called the book ‘Silent Spring’ . . . because it was the loss of the birds’ music that would grieve her the most.”<br />Ms. Moore adores birdsong, too, though in “Earth’s Wild Music: Celebrating and Defending the Songs of the Natural World” she details the threat of a broader quiet across the planet if humanity fails to heed warnings about the extinction crisis and other environmental challenges before us. “In the fifty years that I have been writing about nature,” she laments, “roughly 60 percent of all individual mammals have been erased from the face of the Earth. The total population of North American birds, the red-winged blackbirds and robins, has been cut by a third. Half of grassland birds have been lost. Butterflies and moths have declined by similar percentages. As individual numbers decrease, species are being lost, too. As many as one out of five species of organisms may be on the verge of extinction now, and twice that number could be lost by the end of the century.”<br />Given its subject matter, “Earth’s Wild Music” is necessarily a serious book, but its moral insights are occasionally leavened with humor. Ms. Moore is a fervent nature lover, sometimes comically so. She finds it grand when a woodpecker rat-a-tat-tats her roof in the wee hours of an Alaskan morning, breaking her sleep, though the author’s sister suggests earplugs. Ms. Moore grieves when a new roof proves less welcoming to the noisy critter and devises largely fruitless expedients to lure him back. She overcomes a fear of caves and enters one in Arizona, and, on a desert campout, she not only accepts the presence of rattlesnakes but goes out looking for them—at night. And while others might be put off by the spines of a saguaro cactus, Ms. Moore thrums them like a guitar. “If a person is patient in her plucking,” she notes, “she can play music” on the prickly plant.<br />The straight man for Ms. Moore’s quixotic adventures is her husband of many years, Frank Moore, a retired neuroendocrinologist whom she affectionately describes as “tall and strong . . . ruddy as a ponderosa pine.” He’s also dying of a cancer working “quietly behind the scenes.” The mere thought of his absence, she mentions in a passage that brings a lump to the reader’s throat, brings what she calls “anticipatory loneliness.”<br />Ms. Moore considers the possibility of an even wider loss—the souring of seas, the withering of forests, and the wholesale disappearance of many kinds of life, which she regards as a form of spiritual impoverishment, too. “My nightmare is that before we lose the Earth’s life-sustaining systems, we will lose its soul-sustaining system—the Earth’s wild music,” she writes.</td>

      <td>Federal Reserve faces a challenge in how it will eventually communicate an exit strategy with the market</td>
      <td>The first rule of tapering is don’t talk about tapering anytime soon.<br />Federal Reserve policy makers probably think the prospects for the economy in 2021 look significantly better than they did when they gathered mid-December. For now, though, the economy is facing the surge in Covid-19 cases that began last fall, along with the related stepped up caution and restrictions. Following their two-day meeting Wednesday, they focused on the downside.<br />They noted in their post-meeting statement that the recovery in the economy and job market has slowed. They again committed to keeping rates near zero until the labor market is tight and inflation has obviously cleared its 2% target rate, and to keep buying $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage bonds per month “until substantial further progress” has been made toward those goals.<br />Yet though the economy has weakened in recent months, economists have been raising their growth forecasts. Following the Fed’s December meeting, for example, economists at  JPMorgan Chase  reckoned that in the fourth-quarter of 2021, gross domestic product would be 3.4% above its year-earlier level. Since then, they have raised that forecast to 5.4%.<br />There are multiple forces driving the improved outlook. First, there is the Covid-19 relief package that was passed late last year. Its extension of jobless benefits, renewed support for small businesses and the direct payments it provided to many Americans assuaged concerns that GDP might actually contract in the first quarter relative to the fourth. Second, with Democrats gaining control of the Senate, another round of fiscal support is looking likely in the months ahead. Throw in expectations that enough people will be vaccinated for life to take on some semblance of normal later this year, and things start looking pretty rosy.</td>

      <td>GameStop  is the platonic ideal of a stock bubble.<br />A combination of easy money, a real improvement in the company’s prospects, technical support from a short squeeze and a mad rush to get rich or die trying pushed stock in the retailer up 64-fold from late August to Wednesday’s close. Anyone who has held on for 10 days made gains of more than 10 times their money.<br />It is tempting to see GameStop as merely clownish behavior in a chat room having some amusing effects on a stock few care about. That would be a mistake.<br />Sure, the wildly popular Reddit group Wall Street Bets—slogan: like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal—is full of childish chat. Several users report that they have bet their parents’ pension fund on GameStop or that the boss’s daughter has bought in. There are plenty of calls for the stock to go to $1,000 or more (it started the year at $18.84).<br />But GameStop’s soaring stock—and similar moves in  BlackBerry ,   Nokia  and others—is a bubble in microcosm, with lessons for those of us worrying about froth elsewhere in the market.</td>

      <td>SO MANY DISHES on the menu at Balkan Treat Box come straight from St. Louis’s Bosnian community, the largest outside Europe, said chef Loryn Nalic. Her husband and business partner, Edo Nalic, came to the city as a refugee in his teens. Early in their courtship, this recipe became a touchstone.<br />Ms. Nalic learned to cook the meat-and-potato pie helping to prepare for a community event. A phyllo crust with a filling of potatoes and smoked beef, it traditionally comes with yogurt drizzled on top—and also takes quite a long time to make, Ms. Nalic noted. At Balkan Treat Box doing things traditionally is very much the point, but for those cooking at home the chef has come up with a few short cuts.<br />Jumpstart the process by blanching the potatoes until they’re tender and creamy; meanwhile, sauté the onions and the sausage. For the crust? Frozen phyllo to the rescue. Simply layer sheets of thawed dough in a pan and brush with melted butter. Folded over the savory filling, the pastry bakes until golden and crisp. In addition to that drizzle of yogurt, you can add crumbled feta and some parsley if you really want to make it a feast (however fast).<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

Perhaps no issue encapsulates the hypocrisy of the far-left agenda than putting the needs of the few—transgender girls—above those of the many—biological girls. I am hopeful that female athletes will unite in opposition to President Biden’s recent executive order and that prominent female athletes will express their discontent.

      <td>Canadians have known for decades that in dealing with America, the rules may change midgame or that Americans may disregard the rules entirely if it suits them.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Keystone Pipeline Kill” (Jan. 21): Spare us the concern for Canada’s feelings. Canadians, and particularly those of us from Alberta, have known for years that Keystone was at risk. Significant changes in energy markets, environmental and climate outlook, and political will over the 15 years since Keystone was proposed have painted an increasingly bleak picture for the project. These forces are at play world-wide, including in Canada, where we can’t get a pipeline built across British Columbia for the same reasons. So as disappointing as the Keystone cancellation may be to many, it is hardly a surprise or an insult.<br />Canadians have also known for decades that in dealing with America, the rules may change midgame or that Americans may disregard the rules entirely if it suits them. Softwood lumber comes readily to the mind of most Canadians. Investors know the same thing, so the president’s announcement was neither surprising nor a departure from well-established practice.<br />As far as insults go, the president’s action doesn’t even rank. The gold standard for that might be President Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, on the assertion that those industries constitute a threat to U.S. national security. Canada, a threat to U.S. national security? Now that’s an insult.<br />Brian Ward<br />Thousand Oaks, Calif.</td>

      <td>Regarding “Wireless Charging Fuels Electric-Car Hopes” (Business & Finance, Jan. 19): A similar problem faced the railroad industry in the 19th and early 20th centuries.<br />Steam locomotives were the darlings of technology and absolutely anything that could deliver passengers and freight faster and faster to their destinations was tested. But a train had to stop at a water tower (charging station) when it ran low, sitting there, waiting a long time to be refilled. Civil engineers working for the railroads came up with under-way (without stopping) water replacement. To accomplish this, trenches were built in the railroad bed and filled with water. As the train passed, it sucked up the water without slowing down.<br />Modifying the train, the tracks, the plumbing and the labor required enormous costs paid for by the railroad—not the taxpayer.<br />Ecclesiastes 1:9: Nothing under the sun is new.<br />Thomas Kolber</td>

This week alone there are projects with Denzel Washington and Jared Leto (“The Little Things”) and Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan (“The Dig”). Spotify is also leaning on notable actors to voice audiobooks like Forest Whitaker, Hilary Swank and Cynthia Erivo.<br />Here’s how to stream them:<br />(HBO Max)<br />When John Lee Hancock wrote the script for “The Little Things” in the ‘90s, he envisioned it as a ‘70s movie—complicated characters, lots of questions and not as many answers. He had a deal with Warner Bros. and Steven Spielberg, but Mr. Spielberg ultimately passed on directing it. The story, about a sheriff’s deputy, a detective, and the search for a serial killer, was too dark for Mr. Spielberg to dive into right after “Schindler’s List,” he recalls.<br />Years later, after Mr. Hancock started directing films like “The Rookie” (2002), his producer on “The Little Things” encouraged him to direct the movie himself. But by then Mr. Hancock had young children at home and didn’t want to spend two years in the darkness, either.</td>

Six people were charged in federal court while eight others were charged in state court with aiding the alleged scheme.<br />In the plea agreement, Mr. Garbin, 25 years old, of Hartland, admitted to more than six pages of allegations.

      <td>Today’s researchers have tossed out price theory and don’t realize they’ve been politically compromised.</td>
      <td>William Allen, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of California, Los Angeles died Jan. 15 at 96. Few noted it, but Allen’s death was momentous. It represented a generational shift in the economics profession, one that bodes ill for economists and the public. Allen truly believed in economics—something that is hard to say about most economists these days.<br />Allen was among the last of a generation of economists who were masters of their craft. He wrote, along with his friend and colleague Armen Alchian, an excellent economics textbook that conveys the power and potential of the economic way of thinking: Despite the complexities of markets, economists can get at the heart of how they work by focusing on prices. This insight is so important, it gives economists’ core tool kit a name: price theory. Nobody can be an economist who is unfamiliar with or uncomfortable using this tool kit.<br />Yet by this standard, there are not many economists left. Professional economists are abandoning price theory in droves. The new status quo has upended the field. Economics is increasingly less scientific and more susceptible to political influence.<br />The absence of price theory in today’s economic research would have befuddled the great economists of the past. Contrary to the field’s naysayers, the golden age of 20th-century price theory was never about “neoliberalism” or “market fundamentalism.” Instead, it applied to markets a simple yet brilliant framework that revealed the hidden ways market prices—exchange ratios between goods—facilitated an extraordinary amount of economic coordination. It also showed why many (but not all) restrictions on price adjustments, such as rent controls, resulted in costly and unproductive secondary effects. This was all a part of a broad explanatory project. While individual economists had their policy preferences, the economic way of thinking was above politics.<br />For years, economics has been getting less theoretical and more empirical. Economists are spending less time building and thinking through simple models, and more time collecting and analyzing data. The “identification revolution” in economics raised the payoff, in the form of elite publications, to finding good data from quasiexperimental settings and conducting advanced statistical analyses. Better empirical work should certainly be applauded. But it came at a cost: an entire cohort of economists with serious theoretical blind spots.</td>

      <td>We know what China is doing in Xinjiang. It’s now official. How will woke corporations react?</td>
      <td>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s determination that the People’s Republic of China is engaged in a systematic genocide of the Uighurs was one of the most significant recent developments in U.S. foreign policy. The State Department found that the atrocities have expanded to shocking reproductive coercion: “PRC authorities have conducted forced sterilizations and abortions on Uyghur women, coerced them to marry non-Uyghurs, and separated Uyghur children from their families.”<br />Because the announcement came shortly before President Biden’s inauguration, its far-reaching implications haven’t sunk in. The Trump administration would have done better to issue this finding before the election, but officially invoking the “genocide” label met significant resistance within the government, as it has in past presidencies. Mr. Pompeo deserves credit for pushing it through.<br />The new secretary of state, Antony Blinken, also deserves credit for not making genocide a political issue: He immediately concurred in his predecessor’s determination. It is now America’s official, bipartisan position that China is engaged in “ongoing” genocide—the gravest of all international crimes.<br />Joe Biden was ahead of the curve, accusing China of genocide in August. At the time a Biden spokesman added, “If the Trump administration does indeed choose to call this out for what it is, as Joe Biden already did, the pressing question is what will Donald Trump do to take action.” That question now passes to Mr. Biden.<br />The State Department has made a finding of genocide only six times, two of them in the past quarter-century: regarding Islamic State atrocities against religious minorities in Syria and Iraq (2016) and Sudan’s campaign in Darfur (2011). But ISIS and Sudan weren’t exactly major U.S. trading partners.</td>

      <td>A flurry of executive orders from the Biden administration has resulted in a wider selloff in the energy industry</td>
      <td><br />The Biden administration’s freeze on new federal oil and gas leases is bad news for the U.S. energy industry, but the market reaction has thrown up opportunities, too.<br />Mr. Biden’s first week in office has been a whirlwind of bad news for the sector: Last week, the administration revoked a permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline and placed a temporary ban on federal leasing and permitting for oil and gas. On Wednesday, the administration announced a pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal territory. While the actions resulted in a steep sector selloff, the moves were telegraphed on the campaign trail.<br />Companies with heavier federal lease exposure—including  EOG Resources ,   Devon Energy ,   ConocoPhillips  and  Occidental Petroleum —started underperforming the broader basket of oil and gas exploration companies in the middle of last year as investors weighed Mr. Biden’s campaign promises of stricter limits on federal oil and gas leasing. The threat seemed plausible given the precedent that the Obama administration set in 2016 when it suspended most new leases for coal mining on federal lands. The same companies suffered steeper drops than the sector overall since last week, when the Biden administration announced the temporary moratorium on leasing and permits.<br />The real surprise seems to be that the Biden administration is weighing the possibility of stopping new permits or not allowing permit renewals on federal territory. The order calls for a “rigorous review of all existing leasing and permitting practices”—something the industry hadn’t anticipated. The move is likely to spur heavy legal challenges.</td>

      <td>How cocooning—or wrapping up in swathes of fabulous fabric—can kelp you kick the Covid blues</td>
      <td>WHO NEEDS a hug? If you’ve been missing physical contact while social distancing these past months, you’re not alone—even if you technically are. I’m among the estimated 28% of Americans who live solo, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, but surely I’m not the only one who’s been quarantining in a single-bedroom apartment with two only moderately affectionate pets (rabbits, in my case) and a coldly efficient Peloton.<br />I have my resources, though. When I’m curled up on my couch craving a squeeze, I find solace in my late mother’s big, black, bubble-shaped, wool cocoon coat. Softer than a sweatshirt, this coat can be swooshed and swooped into myriad styles; whenever I wrap it around my shoulders, I’m enveloped in snuggly reassurance. That it ushers high-volume fabulosity into my flat, isolated life doesn’t hurt.<br />And I’m not alone here, either. Cocooning—or shrouding yourself in decadently draped fabric or a bulbous sculptural garment—is trending, perhaps because it swaddles you into calm. “If you live by yourself and you’re not being hugged, [clothes] can replace that sensation,” said Dr. Carolyn Mair, a London behavioral psychologist. “You feel encased, safe and protected, and we’re looking for that now.” Indeed: Pinterest reports that searches for “cocoon sweater” shot up 155% among its 442 million users in the period between fall 2019 and fall 2020, as compared to the same period a year prior. It predicts cocooning will be a key 2021 trend.<br />In line with that, the spring 2021 runways swarmed with consoling chrysalises. Simone Rocha suggested swathing yourself in layers of Grecian-draped taffeta; Loewe’s Jonathan Anderson proposed you wiggle into a marshmallowy white skirt and a woven dome-like top; and Noir Kei Ninomiya presented all-consuming pink orbs embellished with frills or bows.<br />“Fashion is very reactive,” said New York stylist Malina Joseph Gilchrist. “And the cocoon shape offers protection, comfort and a sense of security.” She observed that these imposing silhouettes recall the work of Spanish couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga who, with his scarab-like coats and puffed-up gowns, popularized the cocoon in the mid-20th century. “We’re in a really uncertain time,” she said. “I think that designers always look to the past for reassurance.”</td>

This suggests that investors don’t see Boeing’s disadvantage extending much beyond the grounding of the MAX, the impact of which was baked into the company’s stock price before the outbreak. It is a risky assumption.<br />Fourth-quarter earnings show why the gulf between the companies could in fact get larger—despite a return to service of the MAX, which was cleared to fly by European regulators on Wednesday.<br />The Chicago-based plane maker on Wednesday reported its biggest-ever annual loss. Investors broadly expected it, but were still disappointed by the final tally: Losses for the fourth quarter of 2020 came in at $8.4 billion, compared with analysts’ expectations of about $500 million.<br />This was in part the result of a $6.5 billion pretax charge Boeing took on its 777X wide-body plane program. The company has now pushed its first delivery all the way back to 2023—making it three years late. The 777X has been affected by the pandemic, but also the assumption that regulators will take much longer to certify new jets after the MAX fiasco.</td>

The other is when market participants buy or sell in a rush, often because they suddenly need to protect their finances—in which case asset prices don’t convey much useful information.<br />The latter is at play now. Hedge funds’ short bets have been unsettled, forcing them to buy back the stocks to limit their losses. Also, punters have been using options contracts to prop up their targets. Such instruments can amplify even small market moves, because they force banks to take the other side and then hedge the risk by buying the actual underlying stocks. It can create a feedback loop: Those stocks then go up, and the value of the options tied to them increases even more, forcing banks to hedge further, and so on.<br />Reddit users haven’t shied away from the technical nature of the price moves, correctly crediting it for their success. But market gyrations caused by bottlenecks in financial plumbing don’t tend to last. The 2018 carnage unleashed by option-driven low-volatility strategies can attest to that. Eventually, there aren’t any forced buyers left. The losses are usually limited in scope.</td>

      <td>Our skin has become a road map of the past year’s lows.</td>
      <td>I feel like I’ve aged six years in six months. These days, it’s a statement often repeated among friends and heard by dermatologists. Can we chalk it up to quarantine exhaustion, or has lockdown actually done something to speed up the aging process on our skin? “I’m hearing more complaints about accelerated aging in my practice than ever before,” says Whitney Bowe, a New York City–based dermatologist and author of The Beauty of Dirty Skin. “It’s very similar to what I used to see when there was a death in the family or a divorce and patients would come in and say, ‘I feel like I aged five years overnight.’ Now we’re seeing that with Covid.”<br />What’s at play may be primarily the effect of chronic stress, which can have a more harmful impact on the skin than shorter periods of acute stress. “Stress drives neurologic and endocrine responses to perceived threats, and prolonged activation of these responses results in abnormalities of the immune system, increased free radicals and subsequent DNA damage, all of which contribute to skin-quality deterioration,” says Robert Anolik, a New York City–based cosmetic dermatologist. The brain responds to perceived danger, he explains, by triggering the fight-or-flight response, leading to adrenaline release and tipping off a surge of other hormones like cortisol, the prolonged effects of which can eventually impact the skin.<br />Long periods of elevated cortisol exposure may be causing many of us to feel that our faces have, quite literally, fallen. “It can actually inhibit your body’s production of hyaluronic acid, collagen and lipids,” says Bowe. “Hyaluronic acid binds a thousand times its weight in water, so it really helps to plump up the skin, and collagen is the triple-helix protein that keeps the skin tight and firm, helping to prevent wrinkles and fine lines.” Finally, lipids, says Bowe, are the healthy fats that bolster the skin’s ability to function as a barrier. When that barrier function is impaired, there’s transepidermal water loss. “Our skin becomes leaky,” Bowe explains, “as water is more likely to evaporate out and allergens, irritants and pollutants are more likely to penetrate in and trigger inflammation.”<br />Inflammation is an issue that New York City aestheticians Carrie Lindsey and Taylor Worden and Boston-based dermatologist Ranella Hirsch all report seeing more of in their respective practices in the past year. Hirsch chalks much of it up to stress and to people overdoing it at home with their skin-care regimens. “Too much free time to experiment with skin care means lots of damaged barriers and inflamed faces,” says Hirsch. “That irritation can quickly age the appearance.” Among Worden’s clients, frequent mask wearing and infrequent mask washing have led to a lot of congested pores along the jawline—now known by the unfortunate term maskne—along with an increase in dermatitis around the mouth. Meanwhile, excess alcohol and caffeine consumption have resulted in dehydration. Because of the cascading exposure to cortisol, and the skin producing less hyaluronic acid and collagen than it naturally would, Bowe’s patients who usually come in for filler every nine months are now returning in five. “The skin is fighting an uphill battle right now,” she says. One other pandemic side effect is a surge in sun damage and melasma. “The lack of regular 9-to-5 office hours and a need to get out of our confined spaces, and because it was the safest place to meet, meant people were outside more than ever before,” says Lindsey.<br />While the pandemic has brought on some very real skin issues, there is also an element that may just be in our head. Hirsch, who dubs the phenomenon the “watched pot,” says, “Never in modern history have so many people had the collective time to stare at their faces up close.” The Zoom factor doesn’t help, either. “It’s impossible to underestimate how much looking at ourselves at less than flattering angles and lighting has impacted our sense of our appearance,” Hirsch says. Though there are a few topical products that one should always use, such as sunscreen and an antioxidant serum to neutralize free radicals, the best treatments for our skin aren’t topical. A healthy diet—antioxidant rich, fruit and vegetable heavy—regular movement, enough sleep, plenty of water, meditative practice such as deep breathing and mental-health support are key for maintaining skin health. It’s a good idea to scale back on the product load. “Hard as it may be to believe, my most fervent hope and the advice I offer daily to my patients is to do less,” says Hirsch. And, most important, be gentle with yourself. “Our skin will recover,” says Lindsey, “and we will begin to look and feel like ourselves again.”</td>

The continentwide death rate surpassed the global average for the first time in January. From Senegal to Zambia, daily cases have risen to roughly twice the previous peak.<br />“The second wave is here with vengeance and our systems are overwhelmed,” said John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />The new deadlier wave could widen the gap between the world’s richest and poorest nations.

Those include rising corporate and government debt levels and declining profitability in some banking systems.</td>

      <td>Ant Group Co. is planning to turn itself into a financial holding company overseen by China’s central bank, responding to pressure to fall fully in line with financial regulations, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Chinese regulators recently told Ant, which is controlled by billionaire Jack Ma, to become a financial holding company in its entirety, subjecting it to more stringent capital requirements, the people said. Ant, in response, has submitted to authorities an outline of a restructuring plan, they said.<br />The plan represents a significant turnaround by a digital-payments juggernaut that has in recent years tried to shed its image as a financial-services provider and fashion itself as an internet-technology company, which helped it command lofty valuations. Before its blockbuster initial public offering was called off in November, Ant had been on track to go public at a valuation north of $300 billion, well above the market capitalizations of the world’s biggest banks.<br />Designating Ant in its entirety as a financial holding company wasn’t something earlier envisioned by the company’s executives and stakeholders. In its listing prospectus last year, Ant said it intended for one of its subsidiaries to become a financial holding company and house its licensed financial businesses such as asset management and consumer lending. Doing this at the group level will subject Ant to a thicket of regulations similar to those that govern banks, and affect its growth and profitability.<br />The restructuring plan, still under deliberation, could be finalized before China goes on a weeklong Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February, people familiar with the matter said.</td>

That was even before the coronavirus pandemic brought a decadelong boom in aircraft sales to a halt, prompting the company to shed 31,000 jobs.<br />The company took a $6.5 billion pretax charge on the 777X to reflect lower profits over the life of the wide-body plane that is now expected to enter service in 2023, three years late. Airlines have shied away from big jets like the 777X as international travel demand collapsed.<br />Boeing’s fourth-quarter loss lifted its annual deficit to $11.94 billion, with sales for the year slipping 24% to $58.2 billion. That dropped Boeing to fourth spot by that measure behind  Raytheon Technologies Corp. ,  Lockheed Martin Corp.  and  Airbus SE .<br />Chicago-based Boeing didn’t provide any financial guidance on Wednesday.

First, to counteract the higher risk of infection, restrictions on activity may be tightened, pushing some economies back into recession. Britain, where one fast-spreading variant is now widespread, re-entered a full lockdown on Jan. 5. Its economy, which shrank 10% last year, is likely contracting now. The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday it would grow 4.5% this year, down from its October forecast of 5.9%.<br />The second threat is of a possible new variant that is resistant to the immunity conferred by existing vaccines and past infections, which could trigger a new cycle of restrictions and require a new round of vaccinations.<br />If such a variant emerges, manufacturers think vaccines can be updated relatively quickly. Nonetheless, James Stock, an economist at Harvard University who has studied the virus and the economy, warned of a “scenario of this thing sticking around for a much longer time frame.’’</td>

      <td>Hyundai looks well placed in the EV race: But in the meantime, it’s racking up the earnings too.</td>
      <td>Hyundai Motor ’s  electric dreams have helped supercharge its stock. But unlike some other car makers, its old-school auto business is doing very well too: That makes it look like a solid investment.<br />The South Korean car maker reported a 41% rise in operating profit last quarter from a year earlier, indicating a strong recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Hyundai also managed to deliver higher profits despite selling fewer cars. Demand for pricier products like its Palisade sports utility vehicles and cars under its luxury brand, Genesis, have pushed its operating margins to their highest since early 2017. The results, however, missed already-bullish analysts’ expectations slightly: The strong Korean won and recent recalls for its Kona electric vehicle dragged down earnings.<br />But overall, the quarter confirmed that the company is moving in the right direction. Analysts expect a strong 2021: consensus estimates on S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast a 77% rise in this year’s operating profit from prepandemic 2019.<br />The successful shift of Hyundai’s product mix to the more premium end is clearly driving the earnings recovery, but the company’s more futuristic bets are fueling investors’ hopes. Hyundai and its affiliate  Kia Motors  announced in 2019 they would invest $35 billion into future mobility technologies including EVs and self-driving cars. They unveiled a new platform dedicated to manufacturing EVs last year and plan to launch 23 EV models by 2025.  Credit Suisse  expects battery EVs to make up 11% of Hyundai’s sales in 2025, up from 3% last year. The company is also one of the biggest investors in hydrogen fuel cells. The car maker bought a majority stake last month in Boston Dynamics, the company famous for making dancing robots.<br />The market frenzy in EVs has provided fuel for Hyundai’s rally. Its share price has more than doubled since the beginning of 2020, making it one of the best performers among traditional auto makers. At $55 billion, Hyundai has a market value similar to  BMW  and Stellantis, the company formed from the merger of  Fiat Chrysler  and Peugeot. The recent news that it held talks with Apple about cooperation on driverless electric vehicles this month has given the stock another push.</td>

Too many New York tenants can’t pay rent right now, which is making it harder for landlords to pay back their loans and causing tenant debt to pile up.<br />Both sides want to address the issue with more government action, mostly in the form of streamlined rental assistance.<br />“It’s nothing like a crisis to bring odd bedfellows together,” said Judith Goldiner, attorney-in-charge in the Legal Aid Society’s civil law reform unit. “I guess REBNY thinks they can’t evict themselves out of this crisis.

That compares with an $862 million loss in 2019 on sales of $24.6 billion.<br />Tesla delivered quarterly profits during the pandemic despite the temporary shutdown of the company’s lone U.S. car plant because of the health crisis. To manage the impact, Chief Executive Elon Musk battled with local authorities to reopen the factory, temporarily reduced salaries, furloughed workers and sought rent breaks. Later in the year, he tested positive for Covid-19.<br />The 17-year-old company’s performance, coupled with wider investor enthusiasm about electric vehicles, sent the stock soaring more than 700% last year and turned Tesla into the world’s most valuable auto maker.

      <td>A sharp climb in U.S. government bond yields has stalled, easing investors’ concerns that rising rates could undercut recent gains in riskier assets.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note has hovered just above 1% for the past nine sessions after jumping from around 0.9% to almost 1.2% in just six days of trading.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, vaulted higher on Jan. 6 when Democrats won two pivotal Senate elections, securing control of the chamber. That boosted investors’ expectations for government spending—which can weigh on bonds by leading to a larger supply of Treasurys—as well as economic growth and inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of bonds’ fixed payments.<br />A $38 billion auction of 10-year notes on Jan. 12 posed a key test of the market. Yields had breached levels not seen since early in the pandemic and were rising quickly, with investors unsure about where they were heading. A poorly received auction could have added to the selling. Instead, it met strong demand, as did a 30-year bond auction the next day, and yields quickly steadied.<br />“A lot of people were kind of saying, ‘OK, well, how far does this go?’” said Blake Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy at NatWest Markets. “Then when we got these strong auctions, that was a clear sign that, ‘OK, there’s demand somewhere.’”</td>

      <td>Shares of a handful of firms such as  GameStop Corp.  and  BlackBerry Ltd.  have posted triple-digit gains in recent weeks, part of a frenzy whipped up by individual investors. Here’s what you need to know.<br />Shares of GameStop are up more than sevenfold in 2021, compared with a 2.5% rise in the S&P 500. The Grapevine, Texas, videogames retailer has become a favorite of online traders who invest in companies championed on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets.<br />These investors target short sellers who are betting the shares will fall due to what they see as the firm’s business challenges. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s basket of the 50 stocks with the highest short interest—Wall Street wagers that the shares will fall—was up 25% for the year through Friday. Surging prices in heavily shorted shares such as GameStop have led to large losses at hedge funds that bet against stocks, prompting an emergency $2.75 billion deal to rescue one such firm.<br />GameStop shares began to take off on Jan. 11, after the company said it had agreed to add three new directors to its board, and the rally accelerated in the days that followed. In part the gains reflect the popularity in recent months of momentum trading, the practice of investing in firms whose share prices are rising in the expectation they will continue to do so, and a surge over the past year in options trading, which allows users to make large wagers with a relatively small upfront investment.<br />Options are contracts that allow investors to buy or sell a stock at a specified price, either on or until a specified expiration date. They have become increasingly popular with small investors in recent years, as brokerages have made it cheaper and easier to trade them. Options trading volume set a record last year, averaging just under 30 million contracts a day. This year, that number is over 40 million, according to Options Clearing Corp.—a rise of more than a third.</td>

      <td>TOKYO—The organizers of this year’s Summer Olympics in Tokyo have pushed back hard on recent speculation that the Games will have to be scrapped because of the pandemic. There is one more person they’d like on the team to press the message: President Biden.<br />“Mr. Biden is dealing with a tough situation with the coronavirus,” said Haruyuki Takahashi, a member of the executive board of Japan’s Olympic organizing committee. “But if he makes a positive statement about the Olympics going ahead, we’d gain strong momentum.”<br />The U.S. brings the largest contingent of athletes and the richest pot of television money to the Games. It is also Japan’s ally and military protector, so an expression of determination to push ahead would be influential with a skeptical Japanese public and reassure other countries that aren’t sure about sending athletes to Tokyo.<br />Uncertainty over the Games is rising as virus cases have rebounded in many countries and vaccination programs have stuttered. A U.K. newspaper reported last week that Japan has given up on hosting the Olympics this year. The government called the report “categorically untrue.”<br />International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bachheld phone calls on Friday with national Olympic committees around the world to reassure them about the Games and discuss coronavirus vaccinations for athletes. He has said there is no alternative plan for the Tokyo Olympics.</td>

      <td>Forty-five Senate Republicans voted Tuesday to support a motion saying an impeachment trial of a former President is unconstitutional, and the media are professing shock. Haven’t they been paying attention? GOP opposition to trying a former President who is now a private citizen has been building since Inauguration Day, and based on current impeachment evidence the vote suggests the trial will end in Senate acquittal.<br />This has been predictable since House Democrats voted to impeach Mr. Trump in the waning days of his Presidency and then waited until he was gone before sending the article of impeachment to the Senate. Rand Paul of Kentucky offered the procedural motion. It was defeated 55-45, with five GOP Senators voting with the Democrats. But to convict at an impeachment trial requires a two-thirds majority, or 17 current GOP Senators.<br />There are good arguments on both sides of the constitutional question, and Mr. Trump’s behavior was impeachable. But if Democrats go ahead with the trial, the likeliest result is acquittal, and Mr. Trump will claim vindication and say his second impeachment was as political as the first. Before this is over, Democrats may become enablers of Mr. Trump’s political revival.</td>

Many of them are also passing the extra time with videogames.<br />All three helped Microsoft in its fiscal second quarter, which ended Dec. 31. The company reported Tuesday afternoon that revenue for the period jumped nearly 17% year over year to a record $43 billion. Results in all three of its business segments blew past Wall Street’s forecasts—as did profit. Microsoft’s operating margin came in at 42% for the quarter—4 percentage points higher than for the same period last year. The company’s commercial cloud portfolio saw revenue jump 34% year over year to $16.7 billion. That is both an acceleration from the previous quarter and $1 billion higher than analysts had forecast, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.<br />Plenty of companies found themselves in the right business at the right time over the past 10 months. In Microsoft’s case, though, the pandemic only accelerated some trends on which the company was capitalizing. In particular, the company’s cloud business already was growing steadily. Microsoft also has been able to expand the profitability of its cloud computing businesses despite intense competition from  Amazon.com  and Google. The company noted Tuesday that commercial cloud gross margins came in at 71% for the December quarter—up 4 percentage points from the same period last year.<br />Microsoft also managed to deliver a forecast for the March quarter that was ahead of analysts’ estimates and to affirm that it expects another year of double-digit growth in both revenue and operating earnings for the fiscal year ending in June. Microsoft’s stock rose more than 4% after-hours following Tuesday’s results. That follows a 41% jump over the past 12 months. Its performance actually lags behind the Nasdaq Composite Index a bit as investors have plowed into smaller, trendier cloud names. But as Microsoft keeps reliably demonstrating, size is no handicap.</td>

      <td>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  slashed Chief Executive David Solomon’s 2020 pay by 36%, punishment for the bank’s admission last year that it broke U.S. laws in its dealings with an investment fund at the heart of a global corruption ring.<br />Mr. Solomon received a $17.5 million compensation package for 2020, down from the $27.5 million he got for 2019, according to a securities filing on Tuesday.<br />In October, Goldman agreed to pay nearly $3 billion to government officials in four countries to end an investigation into work it performed for 1MDB, a Malaysian fund that prosecutors had alleged was used to pay bribes to politicians in Malaysia and the Middle East. The bank said at the time that it would take a total of $174 million in compensation from current and former executives.<br />Mr. Solomon’s 2020 pay would have been $10 million higher but for the actions its board of directors took in response to the 1MDB saga, Goldman said in the filing. His compensation package consisted of a $2 million base salary, a $4.65 million cash bonus and a $10.85 million stock award that is tied to how well the bank performs over the next few years.<br />Costs and fines related to the fallout from the 1MDB scandal took a bite out of what was a banner year for Goldman’s businesses, which got a big boost from the markets’ bounceback from the depths of the coronavirus recession. Annual revenue of $44.56 billion was Goldman’s highest since 2009.</td>

The Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said Mr. Hsieh died of complications of smoke inhalation and ruled the death an accident. The full autopsy report will be completed later this week but won’t be available to the public, the chief medical examiner said Tuesday.<br />A spokeswoman for the Hsieh family declined to comment, saying the family is “focused on their work to continue Tony’s legacy.”</td>

Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), who is set to preside over the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, was taken to a local hospital for evaluation after feeling unwell, an aide said on Tuesday.<br />Mr. Leahy, 80 years old, felt unwell while in his Capitol office this evening, the aide said. “Out of an abundance of caution, the Attending Physician recommended that he be taken to a local hospital for observation, where he is now, and where he is being evaluated,” the aide said in a statement.<br />Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said in an interview on CNN that Mr. Leahy’s wife had indicated that “things are going well.” Mr. Durbin said that “we have all got our fingers crossed he will be back tomorrow.”<br />Mr. Leahy is the longest-serving Senate Democrat, having first been elected in 1974. He is third in line for the presidency after Vice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.)<br />The Constitution directs the chief justice of the United States to preside when the president is tried before the Senate, but is silent regarding former presidents. Chief Justice John Roberts presided over Mr. Trump’s first trial, which occurred when he was president.</td>

Mr. Pessina, one of Walgreens’ biggest individual investors, said he was planning to stay on the company’s board and serve as executive chairman.<br />Shares of Walgreens, which has a market value of around $43 billion, rose 7.4% after hours after The Wall Street Journal reported on the move.<br />Starbucks said Tuesday that Ms. Brewer was leaving at the end of February for a new role at another public company. Before joining the coffeehouse chain, Ms. Brewer was CEO of  Walmart  Inc.’s  Sam’s Club division for five years.<br />Ms. Brewer, 58 years old, has been operating chief and a member of the board at Starbucks since 2017. She helped shift Starbucks toward a focus on to-go operations during the pandemic and has worked to diversify the company’s leadership. Starbucks last fall said it would tie executive compensation to increasing minority representation in its workforce, and mandated antibias training for company leaders.</td>

The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Force Congress to Cooperate<br />President Biden inherits a deeply polarized nation. He must fulfill his promise, made during his campaign and inaugural address, to instill unity. Fixing our polarization demands something other than business as usual. It requires cultivating a nontribal, no-nonsense environment in which legislators have no option but to cooperate.<br />Mr. Biden should harness the presidential veto power to reject any legislation that doesn’t receive support from at least 20% of the opposition. The constraint would force lawmakers to come to creative compromises, crafting legislation that the broad majority of the country would support. This would set the tone for the American public, demonstrating that civility and cooperation are possible.</td>

      <td>Congress has a chance to repeal the 1887 Electoral Count Act.</td>
      <td>When Donald Trump addressed supporters in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 at a rally, he led them to believe they could change the 2020 election outcome. Yet states had certified results, lawsuits had run their course, and the Electoral College had voted. President Joe Biden’s inauguration was constitutionally inevitable.<br />The Trump camp was able to gin up false hope by exploiting ambiguities in the Electoral Count Act of 1887 (ECA). The law was intended to resolve contested presidential elections, but in the 21st century it has mainly been used by partisans in Congress to exploit the ceremonial process of counting electoral votes. Some Democrats took advantage of the ECA to cast doubt on legitimate results in 2001, 2005 and 2017, and far more Republicans did the same at Mr. Trump’s urging in 2021.<br />In the wake of the Capitol invasion, the ECA is ripe for an overhaul that reins in Congress’s increasingly destabilizing role in presidential elections. Repealing the law would make future challenges, even by the most willful candidates, less likely to spin out of control.<br />The ECA clashes with principles of federalism and the separation of powers. The Framers didn’t want the executive branch to be beholden to the legislative branch, so they designed an Electoral College to elect the President independent of Congress. Voters in each state register their choice for President by choosing a slate of electors, whose votes are then transmitted to Congress to be logged.<br />Yet the ECA allows Congress to unconstitutionally interfere with state decisions. Members of the House and Senate can claim electoral votes are not “regularly given” or “lawfully certified,” holding up the count and disqualifying electors if a majority in both houses agrees.</td>

      <td>A judge stops his deportation pause after the state of Texas sues.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump complained often about the frequency with which federal judges blocked his immigration orders, starting with his first sloppy travel ban in 2017. Now it’s President Biden’s turn, as a federal judge in Texas issued a temporary restraining order on Tuesday against Mr. Biden’s 100-day moratorium on deporting illegal aliens.<br />Judge Drew Tipton, a Trump appointee, issued the two-week TRO that applies nationwide and said he is considering a permanent injunction that would extend longer. The judge ruled on a suit filed by the state of Texas arguing that the deportation pause violates federal law that obligates the government to police illegal entry to the U.S. Judge Tipton said Mr. Biden’s order violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which is the same law that liberal judges used to issue nationwide injunctions against Mr. Trump’s rules.<br />The Biden Administration may appeal the ruling, and it pays to be skeptical these days when a judge issues a nationwide injunction. Too many judges have grown fond of the power to stop policies they don’t like. The truth in this case will require a more careful view of the legal arguments.<br />Meanwhile, the ruling is a blow to Mr. Biden’s early government by pen and phone, to borrow one of Barack Obama’s famous boasts. Mr. Biden’s pace of executive orders far outpaces Mr. Trump’s in his first week. Maybe he should slow down and make sure his orders are legally buttoned up.</td>

      <td>His ‘Buy American’ rules are even more protectionist.</td>
      <td>Businesses and workers hoping for a reprieve from Donald Trump's trade protectionism had a surprise this week as President Biden adopted his predecessor’s “Buy American” rules, only more so.<br />Rules that favor domestic companies in government procurement have been around since the New Deal. Mr. Trump issued three executive orders to toughen these requirements to promote U.S. manufacturing. Mr. Biden on Monday replaced those orders with his own supposedly tougher rules.<br />One rule would “increase the numerical threshold for domestic content requirements for end products and construction materials” and “increase the price preferences for domestic end products and domestic construction materials.” These thresholds vary by product, but increasing them will make government procurement more expensive and onerous.<br />About 97% of federal purchased goods are made by U.S. firms, but most include foreign-made components. U.S. auto makers source steel from Canada—often produced from U.S. scrap metal—engine components from Mexico, and computer chips from Taiwan. Mr. Biden wants to make federal contractors like Ford and  Caterpillar  buy more domestic components. But manufacturers require specific inputs and metal grades that are often only made abroad. Since the feds make up a tiny share of most U.S. companies’ sales, it doesn’t make sense to overhaul supply chains to comply with Made in America rules.<br />Mr. Biden says domestic content rules must be based on “the value that is added to the product through U.S.-based production or U.S. job-supporting economic activity.” But much of the value from tech equipment and even modern trucks derives from U.S. intellectual property. Will the Biden Administration refuse to buy iPads made overseas?</td>

The Journal’s Siobhan Hughes and Lindsay Wise report from Washington:<br />Since 17 Republicans would be needed to convict (assuming all Democrats vote against the former president) and it seems unlikely that  any senator would endorse a prosecution she deems unlawful—Democrats may now decide it’s pointless to go any further.<br />If they decide to press onward, they may struggle to present the appearance of a fair proceeding. Since Donald Trump is no longer president, Chief Justice John Roberts isn’t going to show up to preside.  Instead, the plan is for one of the Senate’s most ideological members to run the show.<br />Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), the chamber’s president pro tempore,  suggests in a tweet that he’s going to be even-handed:<br />Vermont’s senior senator is not exactly known for judiciousness. The Almanac of American Politics notes: “Leahy is a stalwart liberal known for periodic flashes of temper and can be a sharp-tongued partisan.” His voting record is barely distinguishable from that of his Vermont colleague, the socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders.</td>
