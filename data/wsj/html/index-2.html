      <td>GDP rises 6.5% from a year earlier in the fourth quarter</td>
      <td>BEIJING—China’s economy expanded by 2.3% in 2020, roaring back from a historic contraction in the early months of the year to become the only major world economy to grow in what was a pandemic-ravaged year.<br />China’s ability to expand, even as the world struggled to control a deadly virus that has killed more than two million people, underscores the country’s success in largely taming the coronavirus within its borders and further cements its place as the dominant economy in Asia.<br />China’s growth makes it an outlier among large economies. The World Bank expects the U.S. economy to contract by 3.6% this year and the eurozone’s to shrink by 7.4% in 2020, contributing to a global economic pullback of 4.3%.<br />China’s economy, the world’s second largest, finished the year on a high note. Gross domestic product rose 6.5% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, marking China’s best quarter of year-over-year growth in two years.<br />The results topped expectations. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected growth of 6% in the fourth quarter and an expansion of 2.2% for the full year.</td>

      <td>A cold snap and a supply crunch have created a perfect storm, but the pendulum is likely to swing the other way soon</td>
      <td>It’s been a wild year for commodity markets, marked by despair last spring as the world ground to a halt and followed more recently by exuberance. Nowhere has the bullish feeling been more evident than the usually staid market for liquefied natural gas: February futures for Asian gas hit nearly $20 per million British thermal units last week according to data from Refinitiv. As recently as mid-December, they were only trading around $8 per MMBtu.<br />Unfortunately for gas producers, today’s prices aren’t sustainable and the longer-term supply picture is bearish. Supply stoppages combined with the coldest winter in Asia in decades are a perfect market for those gas producers who still have capacity to supply spot shipments—including U.S. firms like Cheniere. But futures are already pricing in warmer weather a few months out: the April contract is currently trading around $7 per MMBtu.<br />Further out, Chinese demand is still the swing factor—as it is for most industrial commodities. Here the news is bullish, but perhaps less so than some LNG vendors might hope. Chinese demand continues to expand robustly, and China continues to consume far more gas than it produces. The bad news is that the growth of that supply gap has slowed noticeably in recent years.<br />New policies introduced in 2018 and 2019—including a 30% resource tax cut for shale gas and a subsidy pegged to how fast drillers increase output of shale gas and other forms of so-called unconventional gas—have sparked a sharp rise in investment. Chinese oil and gas exploration and development spending rose 25.5% in 2019, according to S&P Global. Natural gas production in 2019 rose faster than consumption for the first time since 2015, improving by 10%.<br />More recently, production growth in the first 11 months of 2020 was also about 9% compared with a year earlier. Annual output growth only averaged 6.7% from 2011 to 2018. And new pipeline capacity for gas from Russia is also poised to come online, which could boost pipeline gas imports that have mostly been flattish in recent years.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden is expected to nominate Rohit Chopra, the former student-loan watchdog at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to lead the agency, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />If confirmed, Mr. Chopra would replace Kathy Kraninger, a Trump-appointed official who has run the bureau since 2018. The decision to tap Mr. Chopra, a Democrat currently serving as a member of the Federal Trade Commission, was expected to be announced along with that of Gary Gensler, Mr. Biden’s expected choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, the people said.<br />A spokesman for Mr. Biden’s transition team declined to comment.<br />Mr. Chopra previously served as the bureau’s student-loan ombudsman during the Obama administration, where he used his public stage to push student-loan companies to improve their treatment of borrowers. His tactic of applying pressure through public means was a big departure from the more measured style of other financial regulators.<br />The CFPB has been politically polarizing since its creation in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when President Obama tapped Elizabeth Warren, then a Harvard law professor, to set it up. Mr. Chopra, 38 years old, was an early hire of Ms. Warren, who is now a Democratic senator from Massachusetts.</td>

They also are pledging to hire a union workforce and eliminate all greenhouse-gas emissions from operations by 2030.<br />The company’s plans reflect new realities at a time when Democrats are taking commanding positions in Washington, and in an era of growing environmental and social concerns.</td>

Several of the groups used violent rhetoric urging members to attend the D.C. rally the day of the Capitol riot.<br />Since then. some of the groups’ leaders have advised followers to stay away from Washington and other major cities that are preparing for this week with large law-enforcement presence.<br />An Indiana man, Jon Schaffer, identified as a member of the heavy metal band Iced Earth, was arrested on charges of engaging in violence in a restricted building, disorderly conduct and other crimes, and was photographed wearing a baseball cap at the riot bearing the words “Oath Keepers Lifetime Member,” according to an affidavit for his arrest filed on Saturday. The Anti-Defamation League calls the group an “antigovernment right-wing fringe organization.” The affidavit alleged that at the riot Mr. Schaffer used bear spray on police officers.<br />Mr. Schaffer couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. According to the affidavit, in a press interview at a pro-Trump march last year, he said: “We’re not going to merge into some globalist, communist system, it will not happen. There will be a lot of bloodshed if it comes down to that, trust me.” The other members of Mr. Schaffer’s band have said they didn’t condone or support the riot.</td>

      <td>An expiring arms-control deal is a chance to address hypersonics and make China come to the table.</td>
      <td>President-elect Joe Biden’s advisers have been signaling that they will rely on arms-control agreements with Russia to reduce the Defense Department budget. This is no surprise from a new, liberal administration promising dramatically increased domestic spending. Yet a second Trump term might have been little better. Eager to indulge in Covid-19 stimulus spending and convinced of Pentagon mismanagement, even under his own appointees, Mr. Trump was easy prey for Senator Rand Paul.<br />But reliance on arms-control deals with Russia is a fool’s paradise. Whatever relatively small near-term fiscal savings might accrue will be outweighed in the long term by increased threats not only from Moscow, but also from Beijing and rogue states aspiring to become nuclear powers.<br />Mr. Biden’s first arms-control decision will be whether and for how long to extend the New Start treaty. It expires Feb. 5, but can be extended for up to five more years, in whole or in part. The threat of the treaty’s expiration should be negotiating leverage for the U.S., but Mr. Biden appears certain to extend it in some form. Vladimir Putin recently proposed a one-year extension, perhaps worried he had received no signals from the president-elect. Mr. Biden should offer six months, thus keeping the heat on, and showing that his team will be more than stenographers for Moscow’s diplomats.<br />The hard policy questions are still the ones Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev and I discussed in August 2018, continued by Marshall Billingslea until the 2020 election rendered Mr. Trump a lame duck. Whether and how seriously Mr. Biden’s negotiators address these issues will determine whether a revised New Start agreement has any chance of being approved by the constitutionally required two-thirds Senate majority.<br />New Start has three broad substantive defects: It omits tactical nuclear weapons; it is technologically outdated and doesn’t address developments like hypersonic weapons; and China is not a signatory.</td>

      <td>Responsible leaders made his election possible by creating a vacuum that a demagogue could fill.</td>
      <td>The best argument for Donald Trump’s presidency was never about the man himself. It was about the people who voted for him.<br />It wasn’t really about what he would do for taxes, immigration or the federal judiciary. He did many needed things on those fronts for sure, but any clever Republican politician with a good pollster could have come up with that agenda. It wasn’t about his vaunted business experience and how he might inject a little necessary private-sector sense into a stultified bureaucracy. It certainly wasn’t about his penchant for conversation-dominating social-media expostulations—polls have indicated a consistent popular distaste for them.<br />The best argument for Donald Trump was that he led and gave voice to millions of Americans who had been leaderless and voiceless for decades. The secret people, as a British poet once described his similarly disdained countrymen—smiled at, paid, passed over. The deplorables. The men and women whom the media, entertainment and corporate human resources types never meet in their local Whole Foods but deride as bigots and brutish neanderthals.<br />People who had voted for Republicans and Democrats and had an increasingly hard time telling the difference. People who had voted for a “compassionate conservative,” who led the nation into a catastrophic and futile war. People who had voted for the nation’s first African-American president, a man promising hope and change but delivering hope mostly for those who had plenty of it already and change for few of those who really needed it.<br />These were Americans left behind by, or alarmed by, the unforgiving juggernaut of “progress” hailed by our political, business and cultural leaders as the glorious arc of history.</td>

      <td>NASA and  Boeing Co.  suffered a potentially major setback in their deep-space ambitions when the engines for a giant new rocket shut down prematurely Saturday during a key test on the ground.<br />The engines were supposed to produce power for eight minutes but shut down after about 60 seconds while fastened to a stand at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. Program officials had said four minutes would be the minimum time to gain confidence in the reliability of the engines, fuel system and surrounding structures.<br />National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said they couldn’t immediately determine the cause of the premature shutdown, and therefore it was too early to determine what fixes would be necessary or even if the test needed to be repeated. They said engineers didn’t know whether it was a hardware, software or sensor malfunction.<br />Boeing is the prime contractor for the mammoth Space Launch System booster, which is more powerful than the Saturn V that blasted Apollo astronauts toward the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was slated for its first uncrewed launch late this year, but that schedule is now in flux. Political and budget pressures on the program, projected to cost a total of between $19 billion and $23 billion to complete, were already increasing.<br />Departing NASA chief James Bridenstine repeatedly said in a news conference that the test shouldn’t be considered a failure, because engineers and program managers gained important data. But he also said, “It’s not everything we hoped it would be.”</td>

And while they can teach coping skills, such as emotion regulation, to help deal with the stress, they say it’s also important for people to proactively take steps to be mentally healthy, just as they would if they wanted to be physically fit. “If you wait until a major stressor hits to try and bolster your mental health, it’s like trying to inflate your life raft while you are already drowning at sea,” says Wendy Troxel, a clinical psychologist and senior behavioral and social scientist at Rand Corp.<br />Many people turn to talk therapy, exercise, meditation and a healthy diet to do this. Shirlee Hoffman, a 75-year-old retired marketing consultant in Chicago, limits her news consumption to about five minutes a day. Erin Wiley, 50, a licensed psychotherapist in Toledo, Ohio, uses an app to track the things for which she is grateful.

Rachel Glyn, 66, a retired aesthetician in Philadelphia, tries to do as many things as possible for others. Michael Schauch, 40, an investment portfolio manager in Squamish, British Columbia, rock climbs—he says the view gives him perspective. Stedman Stevens, 62, the CEO of an aviation technology company in Wilmington, N.C., takes 15 minutes each afternoon to sit alone without distractions. “I listen to what my mind shows me,” he says. “This restores my mental strength.”<br />What steps should you include in your mental-fitness regimen?

Markets adjust to reflect variations in economic performance and generally facilitate adjustments in the global economy.”<br />Ms. Yellen is also expected to say the intentional targeting of exchange rates to gain an unfair advantage in trade is unacceptable.</td>

      <td>Phil Spector, a towering figure in the history of 20th-century pop music known for his symphonic “wall of sound” production technique, who later was convicted of second-degree murder, died Saturday at the age of 81.<br />The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed the death in a statement. The official cause of death hasn’t yet been determined. Since 2009, Mr. Spector had been serving a sentence of 19 years to life for the 2003 shooting death of actress Lana Clarkson at his home.<br />A legendary music producer, songwriter and musician, Mr. Spector, known for hits like “Be My Baby” and “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’,” created a lush, regal approach to music production whose extravagant orchestral arrangements and overpowering layers of sound shaped the pop and rock of the 1960s. More than any other producer of his time, Mr. Spector elevated the role of pop music in culture and transformed the recording studio into an instrument—all while capturing the crushes and breakups of teenagers. A kind of early rock star himself, he also cultivated an aura of mystique with his dark sunglasses.<br />In his later years, the reclusive producer’s musical contributions were overshadowed by his volatile behavior, including his abuse of former wife Ronnie Spector and murder of Ms. Clarkson, who was found shot to death in Mr. Spector’s mansion.<br />Born in New York City on Dec. 26, 1939, Mr. Spector formed a band in high school called the Teddy Bears and wrote and recorded the song “To Know Him Is To Love Him”; its title comes from the epitaph on his father’s gravestone. It topped the charts in 1958. After working with famed songwriter-producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, he issued a string of hits in the early to mid-1960s for acts such as the Crystals, the Ronettes and the Righteous Brothers.</td>

      <td>On Jan. 3, three days before the attack on the Capitol, Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the far-right organization known as the Proud Boys, shared a cryptic post on the messaging app Telegram: “What if we invade it?”<br />The message was sent to his more than 7,000 followers on the app, with the first reply reading “January 6th is D day in America.”<br />The Wall Street Journal reviewed thousands of posts from the Proud Boys and their members across Parler, Telegram and Gab, the social-media platforms where they rallied supporters online after mostly being banned from Facebook and  Twitter .  The messages show the group repeatedly invoking President Trump’s rhetoric in the weeks leading to the Jan. 6 protest as they built momentum toward what became a violent showdown.<br />Investigators have said they are scrutinizing online messages like these as they attempt to determine the planning and intent of those involved in the attack on the Capitol.<br />The Journal’s review, which included now-deleted posts that have been archived by researchers, suggests the Proud Boys viewed Mr. Trump’s messages as a call to action.</td>

      <td>The pandemic sped up demands for changes in the economic system. Shareholders might want to brace for change.</td>
      <td>The Covid crisis both accelerated demands for changes to the economic system and demonstrated that governments can spend freely to help those in trouble when they wish. Will capitalism be changed as a result?<br />To answer the question, it is worth looking back a decade to the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Occupy Wall Street was the protest group du jour, and governments had just allocated trillions of dollars to rescue the financial system. Aside from bank reforms, capitalism (though not global trade) survived pretty much unscathed. This time might be different, because the past decade has prepared the ground for a shift to more interventionist government. The stunning shareholder returns of the past decade hang in the balance.<br />Dominic Barton, then head of management consultants McKinsey & Co. and now Canada’s ambassador to China, summed up the view shared by many of capitalism’s winners in a 2011 article in the Harvard Business Review: “Business leaders today face a choice: We can reform capitalism, or we can let capitalism be reformed for us.”<br />Dozens of think tanks were formed in the 2010s to allow the world’s elite to discuss how to fix capitalism, roping in the pope and Britain’s Prince Charles to speak to corporate leaders. Thousands of environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds were set up, and many old unsuccessful funds had the label slapped on them to make them more attractive.<br />Even the Business Roundtable, the main U.S. corporate lobbying group, signed up for stakeholder capitalism, the idea of paying more attention to the needs of workers, local communities and the environment.</td>

Doria, who is expected to run for president next year, has led a partnership with Chinese company Sinovac Biotech Ltd. to test and produce CoronaVac in São Paulo, criticizing what he has called a “genocidal” lack of action by Mr. Bolsonaro.<br />The dispute comes as the country’s average daily death toll approaches 1,000 people, with scientists warning that a new variant that likely emerged in the Amazon could be partly responsible for a recent surge in infections. For the past week, Brazil has registered an average of more than 50,000 new cases of the disease each day—the highest since the pandemic began.</td>

Meanwhile, investment in renewables and other clean energy technologies is taking off, threatening to eat into the market for oil and gas long-term.<br />Though oil prices have notched gains since November, they’re expected to remain below levels that support attractive returns, particularly for an industry still recuperating from last year’s historic drop in fuel demand.<br />As a result, companies aren’t rushing back into drilling. A third of oil producers surveyed by the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter said they planned to raise capital expenditures only slightly this year. About half said they would either keep spending flat or reduce investments.<br />Exxon Mobil Corp.  and  Chevron Corp.  cut plans to invest a combined $260 billion through 2025 to as low as $177 billion.</td>

As two years’ worth of albums finally drop and films land unconventional (but really-happening-this-time!) release dates, the year in culture is filled to the brim. But among the pack of creative voices, a dozen rise to the top: creators who could have a career-making 2021, whether for a spate of projects in the works (such as short stories, two follow-up novels and a screen adaptation from Booker Prize–shortlisted author Brandon Taylor) or the singular and magnetizing nature of a single show (Pakistani artist Salman Toor’s spellbinding Whitney Museum show, already a hit since its recent opening).

      <td>Doctors answer questions about preparing for the Covid-19 vaccine</td>
      <td>Those getting ready to roll up their sleeves for a Covid-19 vaccine shot will take part in the most ambitious vaccination effort in U.S. history. As efforts ramp up, here’s advice from doctors involved with the vaccine rollout on how to prepare and what to expect.<br />Many people will register for a timed appointment, aimed at keeping wait times and the potential for crowds to a minimum—although the patchwork rollout so far has also meant many waiting in long lines. After filling out consent forms and receiving the shot, you’ll be monitored for adverse reactions for 15 or 30 minutes depending on your allergy history. In the case of a timed appointment, the entire process should take around an hour, says Julie Boom, co-chair of the Covid-19 Vaccine Task Force at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, which is now vaccinating eligible patients that already have records within the hospital system. Afterward, some people choose to go home and rest.<br />In most cases, you’ll simply need your photo ID and proof of your appointment. Some places may require additional documents, such as employee badges for first responders to show they are eligible. Those getting vaccinated generally shouldn’t be asked to pay, so do ask questions if payment is requested.<br />For now, the two vaccines available in the U.S. are found to be similarly safe and effective, says Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University in New York. Eventually, choosing one vaccine over the other may come down to scheduling conflicts, she says. The second dose of the Pfizer vaccine is offered 21 days later, while Moderna is offered 28 days later. “The only thing I would consider is convenience,” says Dr. El-Sadr.<br />No food precautions are required. Staying well hydrated prior to the vaccine is encouraged for people who tend to feel lightheaded with vaccines or blood draws, says Gregory Huhn, vaccination coordinator for Cook County Health, a hospital system in Chicago.</td>

The 300,000-member Alpha Kappa Alpha is a century-old organization of Black women with a record of social and political activism. “Her election is a reward of that loyalty.”<br />Instead, President-elect Joe Biden and Ms. Harris will be sworn into office during a scaled-back inauguration in a heavily fortified Washington. The inaugural committee for weeks has encouraged Americans not to come to Washington due to rising coronavirus cases and deaths. Security around the event has increased after a pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from certifying the Democrats’ Electoral College win.<br />Dr. Glover, who is also the president of Tennessee State University, said the AKAs had decided to scrap plans for a reception at a Marriott in the nation’s capital. Instead, she told regional leaders they could conduct smaller, virtual hangouts over Zoom during Wednesday’s ceremonies.<br />Ms. Harris—the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants—will become the first female vice president and the first who is Black and of Indian descent when she takes the oath of office. The moment carries particular meaning for many Black women who see Ms. Harris as a barrier-breaking political leader, but in interviews, several women said it is also somewhat bittersweet without the traditional pomp and circumstance.</td>

      <td>The coronavirus pandemic delivered a lingering, and possibly permanent, hit to business travel that is likely to weigh on employment and economic growth in some communities for years.<br />Beyond the blows to airlines, hotels, travel agents and rental-car companies, the drop in business travel is rippling through whole ecosystems of related commerce, including airport shops, downtown bars and restaurants, construction firms building convention stages, entertainers, taxi drivers and aircraft-parts manufacturers.<br />Domestic and international business travelers in the U.S. directly spent $334.2 billion in 2019, supporting 2.5 million jobs, according to the U.S. Travel Association. But when considering the follow-on effects, it estimates the economic output and jobs supported by business travel were roughly double those figures before the pandemic.<br />“When a large convention or event is happening, the entire city is involved,” said Tori Emerson Barnes, the association’s head of public affairs and policy. “The florist that provides the flowers, the dry cleaners that prepare the linens, the coffee shop that serves travelers. Whole downtown areas have been revitalized due to the meeting and events business, and they’ve really struggled this past year.”<br />When global restrictions to control the spread of Covid-19 were put into place last spring, businesses and road-warrior workers were forced to adjust, making sales calls and attending board meetings through videoconferences rather than on-site visits, and adapting to virtual training and networking instead of conference-center seminars.</td>

      <td>Part Elena Ferrante, part Patricia Highsmith–themed thriller, ‘Who Is Maud Dixon?’ is set to be one of the buzziest debut novels of the year</td>
      <td>In WSJ. Magazine’s series “12 for ’21,” we highlight a dozen of the most creative artists and entertainers working today—all poised to have a breakout 2021.<br />Sociopathic tendencies aside, Alexandra Andrews relates to a vital piece of Florence Darrow, the Joan Didion fangirl at the heart of her debut novel, Who Is Maud Dixon? “On the face of it, Florence wants to be a writer,” Andrews says. “But what she really wants is significance.”<br />It was a creeping sense of her own insignificance that inspired Andrews, who was coasting along as a copywriter for fashion brands after having already dabbled in investigative journalism and graphic design, to try her hand at writing a novel. “I spent so many years feeling very dissatisfied with where I was in my career,” the 36-year-old author says over Zoom from the Brooklyn home she shares with her husband, the novelist and Harper’s editor Christopher Beha, and their two young children. “I was looking at my peers and how far ahead they were of me and I felt ashamed, and I was asking myself, ‘How did I get here?’ I felt like I’d squandered my good education and I’d taken this wrong turn.”<br />This low-grade envy and anxiety motivated Andrews to write Who Is Maud Dixon?, a witty and suspenseful folie à deux named after the pseudonymous bestselling author who hires Florence to be her research assistant. The story reads like a love letter to Patricia Highsmith’s The Talented Mr. Ripley, with two slightly off-kilter protagonists locking into an increasingly terrifying game of self-erasure and self-invention, backdropped by the glittering Manhattan literary scene and the precipitous cliffs of Morocco. Part publishing-world satire and part thriller, the book will be published in early March by Little, Brown and Company. Translations will steadily roll out across the globe, with rights sold to 22 territories. Universal Pictures has obtained film rights, and there is talk of shooting the adaptation before the end of this year.<br />In his blurb for the thriller, the novelist James Patterson wrote, “By the end of the book you’ll start wondering if author Alexandra Andrews might be a murderer herself.” With her bright, obliging laughter and buttoned-up-to-there oatmeal-colored cardigan, Andrews has the air of a storybook kindergarten teacher. She has managed the unthinkable: to be a big-ticket writer in 2021 with barely a fingerprint on the web. This is partly due to her vanilla name, kryptonite to search-engine optimization. But dig all you like, and you won’t find her obsessively tending to her social media accounts or writing the personal essays that most contemporary authors rely on for procrastination and self-promotion. Andrews, who has a family-centered private Instagram account, recently started a public Instagram account for the purposes of promoting her book. Here she shares pictures of the “Who Is Maud Dixon?” mug that her husband gave her as a gift for Christmas, and a screenshot of an image that pops up after a Google search for Alexandra Andrews, which states that the author of Who Is Maud Dixon? is an actress, married to a man named Billy Andrews. She “even interned at The Paris Review.” Only the last part is true.</td>

The sale ended Friday ahead of a second phase that determines the specific frequencies each company will receive.<br />The public won’t likely learn the names of the auction’s winners for several weeks, but Wall Street is already taking cues from traditional network operators seeking loans or issuing bonds that could be used to foot the bill.<br />AT&T is in talks with banks about a possible one-year loan of around $14 billion and recently borrowed about $3.5 billion in the short-term commercial-paper market, according to people familiar with the matter.  T-Mobile US Inc.  raised $3 billion through a high-yield bond sale earlier this month.  Verizon  is widely expected to issue bonds in the coming weeks, analysts said.<br />The new debt this year adds to several billion dollars in bonds that carriers issued in 2020 before the auction started.

The country aims to have inoculated 300 million of its 1.3 billion people by August.<br />“This is a huge exercise,” said Mr. Vardhan, who wrote a book about India’s efforts to eradicate polio. “India has tremendous experience in handling these issues.”<br />While some countries have struggled with the scale and complexity of a nationwide vaccine drive, India is confident it can do better because of its experience inoculating its poor populace and maintaining election infrastructure for close to one billion voters.</td>

But the rebound has been unbalanced. It relied heavily on government expenditures and state-sector investments, while private spending remained weak.<br />That is amplifying a trend of declining growth in productivity—or output per worker and unit of capital—in the world’s second-largest economy, according to a new report by the International Monetary Fund. By the measure of average productivity across sectors, a gauge of overall economic efficiency, China’s economy is only 30% as productive as the world’s best-performing economies like the U.S., Japan or Germany, the report shows.<br />This poses a challenge to the leadership’s goal of elevating China into the ranks of rich nations and lifting its living standards.<br />“China has done most of the traditional public investment it can. It’s facing a shrinking labor force. So, where will lasting income growth come from?” said Helge Berger, the IMF’s mission chief for China. “Productivity.”</td>

      <td>LONDON—Ed Mason has 91,000 pints of beer at risk in the U.K.’s third pandemic lockdown, the latest in a series of strict restrictions on business that has sapped morale and made even simple planning a nightmare.<br />Beer from Mr. Mason’s Five Points Brewing Co., a London-based independent brewer, will spoil if the current lockdown stretches beyond the six weeks announced by the government earlier this month. This latest lockdown follows a similar closure of businesses in the spring, a month-long shutdown lasting most of November and into December and a series of fast-changing restrictions that differ by region based on local infection rates.<br />The on-and-off measures have kept U.K. businesses from being able to make even basic decisions about things like inventory levels, cash flow and employees.<br />“The stop-start nature of these restrictions makes it virtually impossible to plan for, whether on cash flow or strategy,” Mr. Mason said. “There is a sense of resignation now.”<br />Adding another layer of uncertainty: On Dec. 31, the U.K. ended a transition period after breaking from the European Union. Some businesses grappling with lockdowns are simultaneously working through new rules for exports, imports and hiring workers from the EU.</td>

      <td>New report suggests most scholars are on the other side; trial could start this week</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The political fate of President Trump, and any ambitions he might have for reclaiming the White House in 2024, could be settled by who wins a debate over whether a president can be convicted through the impeachment process after leaving office—a matter on which the U.S. Constitution is silent.<br />The House impeached Mr. Trump last Wednesday for “high crimes and misdemeanors” for conduct culminating with a speech exhorting thousands of his followers to march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol and “fight like hell” against congressional certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory.<br />“Thus incited by President Trump, members of the crowd he had addressed…unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress, the Vice President, and Congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts,” the impeachment resolution, which won support from 10 Republicans, alleges.<br />The Senate could take the next steps—trying Mr. Trump and voting on his guilt—as soon as this week. Conviction requires a two-thirds vote by senators present; assuming perfect attendance, 17 Republicans would need to join all 50 Democrats to find Mr. Trump guilty.<br />Many Republicans are gravitating toward a technical argument: The Senate lacks jurisdiction to try him after he leaves office, they maintain, because he will be a private citizen. That could allow the Republicans to thread a political needle, voting against Mr. Trump’s conviction without having to defend his conduct, people familiar with the discussions say.</td>

      <td>An epic stock rally faces a key test in coming weeks as investors learn what executives expect for profits and revenues in coming periods.<br />Fourth-quarter earnings season kicked off in earnest Friday with better-than-expected profits from some of the nation’s largest banks. Despite a record quarterly profit at  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. and some bright spots at  Citigroup Inc.  and  Wells Fargo  & Co., shares of all three declined, with Wells and Citi each dropping more than 6%.<br />The market reaction highlights the stakes as large firms begin sharing quarterly results and, more important, their outlooks for coming quarters. Though results weren’t terrible, shares were hit hard, reflecting the rise of investor expectations as bank shares climbed more than 10% for 2021 heading into Friday’s trading.<br />The surge of major indexes to new highs this year, despite an accelerating toll from the coronavirus and questions about how that will affect the economic outlook, underscores the pressure on executives at major companies to spell out how they expect results to improve in 2021. Soft earnings during the S&P’s roughly 70% rise from last March’s intraday low have been deemed acceptable by investors because many expect a sharp rebound this year. Firms whose projections fall short can expect to be punished, they say.<br />“Whether they had a good quarter or not, it’s all about what’s next,” said Kimberly Woody, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, which manages $1.9 billion. “Good future news has been priced into this market.”</td>

      <td>MEXICO CITY—The U.S. warned Mexico it had imperiled the sharing of information on the country’s drug cartels by releasing a confidential dossier providing evidence that Mexico’s former defense minister was in the pay of drug kingpins, pushing bilateral antidrug cooperation to its lowest point in years.<br />Mexico’s action “calls into question whether the United States can continue to share information to support Mexico’s own criminal investigations,” the Justice Department said late Friday, adding that the release of the 751-page dossier on Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos was a violation of bilateral treaty obligations on information sharing.<br />The U.S. response comes after Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador accused the Drug Enforcement Administration of fabricating charges against Gen. Cienfuegos, who was exonerated of drug trafficking and bribery by Mexico’s attorney general’s office Thursday. Gen. Cienfuegos was arrested in the U.S. at the request of the DEA last year and then sent back to Mexico following a diplomatic uproar.<br />The Justice Department’s response might mark the lowest point in bilateral cooperation against criminal organizations since the abduction and killing of the DEA agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena by Mexican drug capos in 1985. It comes as Mr. López Obrador’s administration has struggled to contain the rising political and territorial clout of drug cartels and surging criminal violence.<br />“This opens the door to enormous mistrust,” said Raul Benitez, a security analyst at National Autonomous University of Mexico. “If security relations deteriorate and intelligence sharing is limited, the only winners will be drug trafficking cartels.”</td>

Other Venezuela creditors owed large debts are also circling the oil company.<br />Judge Stark said that each day Crystallex’s roughly $1 billion judgment goes unpaid is “arguably something of an affront” to the U.S. judicial system.</td>

Elections for the Palestinian National Council, which represents Palestinians abroad, were set for Aug. 31.<br />The proposal is part of a broader effort to heal internal schisms within the Palestinian leadership. The issue of Palestinian unity has increased in importance for both Hamas and Fatah following the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, which since last September has seen Israel normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. For decades, the Palestinians have counted on their Arab allies to withhold normalizing relations with Israel until Israel had made peace with them.</td>

Ugandan security forces surrounded Mr. Wine’s home Friday, placing him under effective house arrest after he claimed the vote had been falsified. More than a dozen other senior members of his campaign were placed under house arrest on Saturday.<br />Speaking in a telephone interview from his home, Mr. Wine called the result “completely fraudulent” and said he would share evidence of widespread rigging when the internet was switched back on. Asked whether his supporters would take to the streets to demonstrate, he said: “We have all nonviolent and constitutional options on our table, including but not limited to the right to protest.”<br />Mr. Museveni, at his countryside ranch, said the election was “the fairest since independence in 1962.” He thanked Ugandans for giving him another five years in power.<br />Ugandans voted Thursday amid heightened security and an internet shutdown in a vote that the top U.S. diplomat to Africa called “fundamentally flawed.” The hotly contested and violent race pitched Mr. Museveni, one of Africa’s longest-serving leaders, against Mr. Wine, a youthful populist whose message of change galvanized Uganda’s youth. The contest embodies a generational clash across Africa, where entrenched older leaders are grappling with increasingly restless youthful populations demanding improved economic opportunities.</td>

That left the dollar hovering near its lowest level since April 2018.<br />Expectations for the dollar have been clouded in recent weeks by political turmoil in Washington, D.C., and a worsening economic outlook. The crisis precipitated by the mob attack on the U.S. Capitol inspired some safe-haven buying of dollars in international markets. Elevated coronavirus-infection levels, despite the rollout of vaccines, meanwhile, threaten to subdue an already faltering economic recovery both in the U.S. and abroad, which also suggests downward pressure on the dollar.<br />At the same time, investors expect that a proposed $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan from President-elect Joe Biden will either weaken the dollar or limit any near-term future appreciation as the infusion of cash to businesses and households increases supply. Such an infusion could lend to dollar appreciation over the medium to long term because it will boost U.S. economic growth relative to other countries, but it is likely to work against the dollar in the short term because of the supply issue.<br />“A currency market isn’t different from any other market,” says William Dinning, chief investment officer of U.K. fund manager Waverton Asset Management. “If there’s a lot of potatoes available, it’s going to be cheaper. If there’s a lot of dollars available, it’s going to be weak.”</td>

      <td>The intelligent, human-like machines long promised by science fiction still don’t exist, but they’ve played an important role in the modern imagination.</td>
      <td>In 2021, robots can be forklifts or machine tools, surgical instruments or bomb defusers. As a viral video showed this month, a new, human-shaped model from Boston Dynamics can even dance to the Motown song “Do You Love Me?” But when the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word “robot” in his play “R.U.R.,” which made its debut in Prague 100 years ago this month, he had something much grander in mind: a new, man-made species, capable of tireless labor but also love, hope and self-sacrifice. As a robot declares in the play’s last scene, “We’ve become beings with souls.”<br />Actual robots may be a letdown by comparison, but over the last century, imaginary robots have become one of our best tools for thinking about fundamental questions: What is it that makes us human? How can we be sure of what’s going on in other minds? Do the benefits of progress outweigh its dangers? These used to be problems for religion and philosophy; thanks to robots, we now often approach them through science fiction.<br />People told stories about mechanical men long before 1921. The Argonautica, a Greek epic from the 3rd century B.C., includes the story of Talos, “fashioned of bronze and invulnerable,” who guards the harbor of Crete. A 16th-century Jewish legend tells of the Golem, a huge man of clay made to protect the Jews of Prague. Both of these proto-robots are built with a kind of kill switch, giving humans a way to keep them in check. Talos is deactivated when the thin skin on his ankle is punctured, allowing the fluid that gives him life to run out; the Golem can be stopped by erasing the Hebrew letter written on his forehead. Clearly, humans have always worried that the machines we make to serve us could eventually turn on us.<br />Not until Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel “Frankenstein,” however, did a man-made creature become an object of sympathy. Dr. Frankenstein makes his monster out of body parts scavenged from “the dissecting room and the slaughterhouse,” and it turns out to be all too human. Indeed, the monster is driven to violence because people refuse to acknowledge that he has human feelings, especially a need for love. “Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?” he rages.<br />It took another century of scientific and industrial progress to prepare the world for robots as we imagine them today—mass-produced intelligent machines that can rival or surpass the human race. In Capek’s play, R.U.R. stands for Rossum’s Universal Robots, the company that manufactures them. Capek credited his brother with coining the word “robot” from the old Czech term robota, the labor service imposed on peasants by feudal kings.</td>

There, he steamrolled the opposition to write rules from scratch governing the markets for hundreds of trillions of dollars of derivatives. Some of these complex financial instruments were blamed for the 2008-09 financial crisis.<br />Lawyers, regulators and lobbyists say Mr. Gensler would likely be the most active, pro-regulatory SEC chairman since William Donaldson ran the agency in the wake of the corporate scandals of the early 2000s, or Arthur Levitt’s tenure during the Clinton administration. They also expect a renewed eagerness to pursue enforcement cases against major corporations and Wall Street banks. At the CFTC, Mr. Gensler earned a reputation for an aggressive, sharp-elbow style of management more reminiscent of Wall Street than Washington, at times even clashing with officials in his own party.<br />“He’s a totally different cup of tea than we’ve had at the SEC,” said Hal Scott, a professor of capital markets law at Harvard Law School. “He will do things that are controversial.”</td>

      <td>Men and women are trading their sad WFH uniforms for snazzy sleepwear, spending every waking hour in snugly bliss. These expert tips will help you style PJs for almost any socially distant activity.</td>
      <td>PAJAMAS ARE at least partially responsible for keeping Vincent “the Chin” Gigante out of jail for decades. Starting in the 1960s, the late Mr. Gigante, a notorious New York mob boss, feigned mental illness in a surprisingly successful scheme to convince authorities that he couldn’t possibly be the head of the Genovese crime family. To keep up appearances, he’d meander through his Greenwich Village neighborhood mumbling to himself while wearing slippers, sleepwear and a bathrobe. His pajama game helped him elude arrest until the 1990s, at which point he was locked up for racketeering and conspiring to murder his Mafioso rivals.<br />Today, the Chin’s ploy wouldn’t fool anyone. As the pandemic persists, pajamas have come to seem entirely sensible as all-day wear for social-distancing women and men. Whether you’re Zooming with the boss, running to the store or hosting your pod for cocktails and charades, sporting pajamas from morning ’til the next morning—a style strategy once reserved for degenerates and hung-over college students—no longer provokes censure. Today, in fact, if a man wanted to convince the world he was certifiable, he might have better luck striding down 6th Avenue in a pinstripe suit and a hat.<br />“People are looking for a different way to find comfort and fashion together,” said Roopal Patel, the fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue. She noticed an uptick in the store’s sleepwear sales after the world hit pause last March. Ms. Patel observed that people are procuring extensive pajama wardrobes and assigning different styles to different isolation activities. “Everyone is experimenting with how to wear these pieces with their everyday looks, which they may not have done a year ago.” Indeed, if you pick the right pair, pajama dressing resolves the WFH-era dilemma of how to remain stylish at home. Emulate Sofia Coppola’s marvelous 2013 Met Gala look: metallic Marc Jacobs PJs, subtle sparkly jewelry and a mid-heel sandal. Do not mimic the Dude’s disheveled SoCal-stoner style in the supermarket scene of 1998’s “The Big Lebowski.” Tired, tattered bathrobes should be left in the closet, or the trash.<br />It might seem counterintuitive, but a sharp pair of PJs can look more put-together than the sad WFH uniform to which so many have succumbed: sweatpants, T-shirt and hoodie. The former is “crisp and happy,” said George Cortina; the latter, “sloppy and slovenly.” Mr. Cortina, 55, is a New York fashion editor (who contributes to WSJ.) and pajama evangelist who’s worn custom cotton pairs everywhere from tony Paris eateries to scene-y Los Angeles hangouts. “If you have a fresh set of pajamas,” he said, “there’s something beautiful in the choice you’ve made. If you’re wearing sweats, it’s gray and dreadful.” Mr. Cortina so strongly believes that PJs are the ultimate all-occasion ensemble that, this March, he’s launching a line of unisex poplin pairs with Savile Row tailor Anderson & Sheppard. They’ll come in un-dreadful “1960s Italian Riviera” hues like hot pink and lavender.<br />According to market research firm the NPD Group, as of November 2020, year-to-date pajama sales were up 5% nationwide—a margin expected to increase once holiday sales are factored in. Specialty sleepwear brands have enjoyed an even greater surge: The Great, a Los Angeles casual wear label, and 24-year-old Miami brand Eberjey both report that they saw pajama sales double last year and, after less than a year in business, Los Angeles loungewear upstart Leset sold out of almost every item on its website last spring.</td>

      <td>After a year of startling growth, the tech industry faces a more vexing 2021.<br />The pandemic helped bring the world’s tech giants such as  Amazon.com Inc.  and  Microsoft Corp.  to new heights in 2020. The shift to online shopping and remote working accelerated at a pace that would have been inconceivable without the coronavirus.<br />But there are signs the good times may end soon. Late last year, governments in the U.S., China and Europe separately began investigating whether Big Tech is too big. The scrutiny in Washington is expected to continue under a Biden administration, which also appears inclined to continue the Trump administration’s export restrictions against Chinese companies that are reshuffling global supply chains.<br />While Big Tech faces perhaps its biggest challenge in years, some sectors can look forward to 2021. The world of electric vehicles may finally arrive. President-elect Joe Biden promises to make cybersecurity a priority. And Washington will start doling out financial incentives to help U.S. companies stay ahead of Chinese rivals.<br />Here are some of the tech industry’s most important themes this year.</td>

Nearby, at their desks, a handful of employees appear hard at work. In a conference room, we drop in on a business-development meeting that includes a half-dozen employees sharing documents with one another around a long table.<br />Later, we walk down to the beach, where IDE’s copy editor has set up her desk. She says she prefers the relative isolation here, since her work is less collaborative than that of other employees. Behind us tower the ramparts of IDE’s offices, which are housed in a medieval castle.<br />I’ve been to many corporate offices before, but in terms of square footage and amenities, IDE’s is among the most impressive.

Her mother was an educator and her stepfather was a clinical psychologist, so when she went to college she majored in psychology.

This made Discord a content free-for-all that many parents have been leery of allowing their children to access.<br />But over the past six months, the service, with more than 140 million monthly active users, has instituted changes and is taking a more proactive approach to policing the site for child predators and blocking minors from seeing porn.<br />These changes come as social-media platforms are increasingly scrutinized, from both the political right and left, for their handling of content. They are seen as having played a role in the riot at the U.S. Capitol earlier this month;  Facebook  and  Twitter  are also receiving criticism for deciding to deplatform President Trump and some of his supporters. As Trump supporters look to congregate elsewhere, options are limited: One preferred network, Parler, was evicted by web-service provider  Amazon  and app stores run by Apple and Google, on the grounds that it didn’t do enough to stop the promotion of violence. Parler said its volunteer moderators were overwhelmed with the number of posts as the service experienced rapid growth.<br />Discord has stayed out of the headlines this month, but that hasn’t always been the case.</td>

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado are entering the spotlight at a combustible time. Some have loudly refused to wear masks used to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and objected to metal detectors placed at the entrances to the House chamber after the U.S. Capitol riot.<br />Colleagues are questioning whether freshman lawmakers’ words played any role in stoking anger among President Trump’s supporters before the assault. Mr. Trump was impeached Wednesday over his exhortations to the crowd.<br />“It’s been a hell of a first 10 days,” said freshman Rep. Nancy Mace (R., S.C.), 43 years old, the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, the military college in South Carolina. She voted to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s win, voted against President Trump’s impeachment and has followed House rules. “This was not what I thought Congress was going to be like,” she said.<br />Outspoken freshmen aren’t a new phenomenon. Two years ago liberal House Democrats charged into Washington, where their outspokenness, social-media savvy and willingness to tangle with party leaders raised their wattage above lawmakers who had toiled in the Capitol for years. Now some first-term Republicans are using social media to elbow into the debate over the most divisive issues in the nation.</td>

      <td>In WSJ. Magazine’s series “12 for ’21,” we highlight a dozen of the most creative artists and entertainers working today—all poised to have a breakout 2021.<br />As a young man studying at Aitchison College, an English-style boarding school in Lahore, Pakistan, the artist Salman Toor was often bullied for being “very effeminate,” he says. Toor eventually found a way to use his drawing talent to his social advantage. “My skill was well-known at school, and these big boarding-school boys came to me and were like, ‘Could you please make me a nude picture’ ” of a woman, he says. “I got their protection from my art.”<br />Toor’s talent for figuration has since landed him greater breakthroughs, like his first global solo museum exhibition, Salman Toor: How Will I Know, on at the Whitney in New York until April 4. Before 2018—when Whitney curators Christopher Y. Lew and Ambika Trasi approached Toor about building an exhibition—Toor was relatively unknown in the West.<br />After the Whitney news became public, he showed at Aicon Gallery in late 2018 in New York and at Perrotin in New York in 2019, and last year, he signed on with New York–based Luhring Augustine. His art is now in the permanent collections of the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Tate in London and at M Woods in Beijing, China. Between October and December last year, Phillips and Christie’s sold four of his paintings, including one that went for over eight times its high estimate, setting a record high for Toor.<br />“There’s such an immediacy to his work, yet it’s also so layered in its references to art history,” says Trasi, the Whitney exhibition’s co-curator. “He is really grounded in empathy and compassion toward that very diasporic South Asian community, which is not often represented in painting so directly.”</td>

The number of American students in Taiwan has climbed by nearly 55% during the same period.<br />The shift comes in the midst of a deterioration in the Washington-Beijing relationship and, according to educators, predates the Covid-19 pandemic.

      <td>Or at the very least, buy less. How a new wave of bloggers is rejecting the head-to-toe designer mentality.</td>
      <td>Off Brand is a thrice-monthly column that delves into trends in women’s fashion and beauty.<br />AFTER BEING laid off twice in a row, Aileen Luib decided to take matters into her own hands by starting a blog called “The Baller on a Budget.” Ms. Luib, 28, had long felt the pressure to “keep up with the Kardashians,” as she put it, growing up in the Southern California suburbs as a second-generation Filipino immigrant. She explained: “I felt like I constantly had to uphold certain appearances,” that she had to conceal she had less money than those around her. “It was this constant, vicious battle of trying to keep up and not really share the honest side of my financial story.” Now, she’s sharing the nitty-gritty of her finances—including an itemized breakdown of her blogging income—to her tens of thousands of followers, alongside fashion and beauty content.<br />Certain elite fashion bloggers seem notoriously oblivious of real people’s budgets, as they go on about their sponsored private-island getaways (“office of the day”—wink, wink) and their “unboxing” videos showcasing designer handbags they’re received as gifts. The most famous fashion influencers, like Chiara Ferragni (“The Blonde Salad”) and Charlotte Groeneveld (“The Fashion Guitar”), are inextricably linked to luxury designers like Dior, Valentino and Jimmy Choo. Many vaguely hint at personal wealth which, together with their paid sponsorships, presents an image of heady affluence, a world where a constant stream of brand-new, 4-figure, luxury items is the norm.<br />But during a year when women have been the hardest hit by the financial crisis triggered by the pandemic—accounting for all 140,000 of the U.S. jobs lost in December—this lavish content appears increasingly out-of-touch. According to Mae Karwowski, the New York-based CEO of Obviously, an influencer marketing company, “The idea of a 23-year-old who wears all high-end luxury items—it’s gauche now.” She explained that followers now demand more of a high/low mix from their favorite influencers, to better reflect their own budgets. Influencers are realizing, as Ms. Karwowski put it, that their Instagram account “is not just a mini Vogue magazine.”<br />Canny content creators such as Ms. Luib are presenting a more realistic approach to fashion, inspiring their followers to look at the bigger picture. “My mission is basically to get women like me to take charge of their finances while at the same time not feeling like they’re left out,” said Ms. Luib. She continued, “Because there is a stigma that if you cannot afford the Gucci bag, if you cannot afford the Valentino shoes, that you are not one of them, that you do not have a seat at that table.” She hopes to inspire women to feel worthy and “look the part” without going into debt. Like many content creators, Ms. Luib’s income comes from affiliate links and website ads as well as some promotional deals.</td>

      <td>BERLIN—Angela Merkel’s conservatives opted for continuity on Saturday when they elected as party chairman a centrist who will now likely run as her successor for chancellor in the September election.<br />The appointment of Armin Laschet at an online Christian Democratic Union convention comes as Ms. Merkel nears the end of her 16-year spell as German chancellor, during which she positioned the conservative group firmly in the middle, adopting liberal and left-leaning policies and winning voters from across the political spectrum.<br />Mr. Laschet, the prime minister of Germany’s most populous state, North-Rhine Westphalia, has positioned himself as a middle-of-the-road politician, and he is widely expected to preserve that legacy. The decision whether he will lead the conservatives in the election campaign as candidate for chancellor will be made in a separate vote by April, party officials said.<br />In a speech before the election, Mr. Laschet said the success of the CDU was largely due to Ms. Merkel’s personal leadership, signaling that he would follow in her footsteps.<br />Mr. Laschet said many voters liked Ms. Merkel more than they did the CDU—a view borne out in most opinion polls. “We need to retain this trust as a party and we need to deserve it,” he said. “We must speak candidly without polarizing, [the new leader] must master the tools of making politics in the center.”</td>

      <td>LONDON—Coffee and groceries are becoming a bigger part of  BP  PLC and Royal Dutch  Shell  PLC’s bottom line.<br />Gas stations have emerged as one of the most profitable parts of the major oil companies’ sprawling operations during the pandemic, with higher spending on food and drink offsetting weaker demand for fuel. That is encouraging both companies to push ahead with plans to expand their retail businesses, which they are betting can help offset declining oil income longer term.<br />Shell plans to add 10,000 branded retail sites to its 45,000-strong network world-wide—larger than  Starbucks Corp.  or  McDonald’s Corp —in the next five years. BP, which currently has 19,000 locations, wants to add 6,700 sites in growth markets by 2030.<br />“We believe we can more than offset the impact of fuel volume declines in established markets to 2030 through growth in convenience,” Emma Delaney, BP’s head of customers and products, told investors at its strategy event last year.<br />Selling coffee, food and other household items at gas stations is an attractive business, executives and consultants say, because profit margins are typically higher than the oil business and returns are more stable because they aren’t linked to volatile energy prices.</td>

The bulk of the debt—$47.6 billion—is dollar bonds. The CreditSights figures include maturing bonds and a smaller sum of puttable debt, which has a longer maturity but which investors have the right to sell back during 2021.<br />At the same time, support from China’s powerful state banks is waning, profits are still recovering after tumbling in the early phase of the pandemic and regulators are taking a tougher stance on financial risk in the sector.<br />To further complicate matters, international defaults by Chinese borrowers, including some smaller real-estate firms, have grown more common in recent years. And a spate of defaults late last year by state-linked companies rattled investors in China’s huge onshore bond market, where property developers are also active borrowers in yuan.<br />While yields are high compared with many other investments, analysts and investors say the market is likely to draw sharp distinctions between healthier and weaker borrowers.</td>

      <td>He doubles Obama’s 2009 plan even as the economy is poised to take off in 2021.</td>
      <td>Those two Georgia Senate races were more expensive than even we thought. “With interest rates at historic lows, we can not afford inaction,” President-elect Joe Biden declared Thursday night. He wasn’t kidding as he outlined a $1.9 trillion Covid spending plan, which comes on top of the $900 billion Congress appropriated last month, and the $2.9 trillion in the spring. And this is only Mr. Biden’s “first installment,” as Sen. Bernie Sanders put it.<br />The first point to understand is that this blowout has nothing to do with economic stimulus. Nearly all of the money is for income redistribution—some to people in genuine need, but most to advance long-term Democratic social policies, and to massage constituencies like teachers unions and state politicians.<br />This may boost short-term consumer demand, which is already poised to explode once the pandemic eases. But it won’t change incentives for growth because people don’t change their behavior unless they expect long-term earnings to change, as John Cogan and John Taylor described Friday on these pages.<br />More government spending will only help the economy to the extent it ends the pandemic faster and helps people get back to work. Toward that end Mr. Biden proposes $70 billion for vaccines, therapies and testing in addition to the $42 billion that Congress passed last month. This will make a difference if it delivers vaccines faster, though the main bottlenecks now are bureaucratic and political. Ditto for therapies. The Food and Drug Administration restricts access to monoclonal antibodies for hospitalized patients, for example, but local governments have struggled to set up non-hospital infusion sites.<br />Most of the rest of the Biden plan is a repeat of the 2009 Obama plan—doubled. State and local governments will get $350 billion, though many have more revenue than before the pandemic thanks to buoyant equity and housing markets. State and local non-education employment has fallen 3.7% since February compared to 6.5% for private business.</td>

      <td>It’s the end of an era, but save your tears for the people of Illinois. Mike Madigan, the speaker of the state House in Springfield for nigh four decades, lost his gavel at last. This week the chamber picked his successor and a new leader: Rep. Emanuel “Chris” Welch.<br />Anyone who’s dreaming of a new era of growth economics or spending restraint will probably be disappointed. Mr. Welch is “regarded as a Madigan loyalist” and a “Madigan ally,” the Chicago papers report. “This state,” Mr. Welch himself said, “will never be able to adequately thank Speaker Madigan for the job he has done.”<br />Mr. Welch was first elected in 2013 from Hillside, a Chicago suburb south of O’Hare Airport, and at least he’s talking about decentralizing power. “I want to examine the rules and possibly make changes—possibly make a lot of changes,” he said. One might be a 10-year term limit on the speakership.<br />Mr. Welch, who is Illinois’s first black speaker, urged a lowering of partisan tensions. “Why do our politics have to be about negativity and destruction?” he asked. It’s a good question. But it will take more than bipartisan bonhomie to reverse Illinois’s spiral of high taxes and bloated government, which has caused so many residents to flee over Mr. Madigan’s tenure.<br />Democrats finally dumped Mr. Madigan because they feared his high public profile and a corruption probe were hurting them. But they still like Mr. Madigan’s system of public-union dominance and gerrymandered districts. The old boss may be gone, but his system survives.</td>

The Trump years provided a crucial correction to the progressive excesses of the Obama years, and as the left prepares to retake power it is already trying to rewrite history.<br />Take Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who is being kicked on her way out the door. “Good riddance, Betsy. You were the worst Secretary of Education ever,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted following Mrs. DeVos’s resignation last week as a matter of principle after the riots at the US. Capitol. She should wear the Senator’s smear as a badge of honor.<br />Democrats loathe Mrs. DeVos because she has stood up for children and due process in defiance of the progressive playbook. A decades-long advocate of school choice, Mrs. DeVos put students and parents at the center of her agenda. “It shouldn’t matter what type of school a student attends, so long as the school is the right fit for that student,” she said in a March 2017 speech.<br />The federal government plays a small role in K-12 education, but Mrs. DeVos advocated for charter schools and private-school vouchers and often visited inner-city schools to highlight education inequities. Her department this summer announced $85 million over five years for the Washington, D.C., Opportunity Scholarship Program, which offers vouchers to low-income students.<br />Mrs. DeVos also scrapped onerous Obama-era higher education regulations. She killed the Obama Administration’s informal Title IX guidance to colleges that created kangaroo courts for adjudicating sexual assault accusations on campus. Her new rule provides due process to accused students, including the ability to cross-examine accusers and appeal judgments. The rule has survived several legal challenges.</td>

That isn’t in the power of the federal government, let alone an advisory commission. Instead, the 1776 Report makes the case for the American creed and a less radical way to teach history.<br />“Neither America nor any other nation has perfectly lived up to the universal truths of equality, liberty, justice and government by consent,” the report states. “But no nation before America ever dared state those truths as the formal basis for its politics, and none has strived harder, or done more, to achieve them.”<br />The Declaration of Independence’s claim that “all men are created equal” was a revolution in itself, a turning point in world history. To reduce America to its violations of that principle, as do many contemporary writers, is to miss the distinguishing part of the story that roused freedom lovers and terrified tyrants everywhere—and still does. Martin Luther King Jr., whose birthday we celebrate Monday, could make America better by insisting it be truer to its own founding principles.<br />Those steeped in recent academic accounts of the U.S. may wonder how the 1776 Report can say core U.S. principles are “true” and still call itself history. That’s because it reads the Declaration not as archaeology or dissimulation, but as a live claim that demands adjudication.</td>

Brandler, the acting U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, said in a statement Friday. “Therefore, no criminal charges will be filed and the matter is closed.”<br />The probe centered on nine ballots, which investigators said had been discarded and then recovered in Luzerne County in northeastern Pennsylvania. Of those nine ballots, seven were cast for Mr. Trump, the U.S. attorney’s office previously said.<br />In a statement issued in September, the county said that a temporary contractor had erroneously put some mail-in ballots in the office trash.

      <td>‘I will return,’ vowed the general. To make that happen required a daring attack from the sky.</td>
      <td>There is no shortage   of good books on the bloody fighting in the Pacific during World War II. “With the Old Breed,” Eugene Sledge’s first-person account of the harrowing combat on Peleliu and Okinawa, and “Utmost Savagery,” Joseph Alexander’s history of three days of battle on Tarawa, are but two. Now add to their rank “Rock Force,” Kevin Maurer’s excellent and detailed account of the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment’s daring airborne assault and conquest of Corregidor, a mile-wide, 4-mile-long, tadpole-shaped piece of volcanic rock jutting up nearly 600 feet at the mouth of Manila Bay.<br />Following the Spanish-American War, the U.S. made Corregidor nearly impenetrable with heavily fortified coastal artillery pieces installed throughout. But like any military asset, it was only as good as its supply lines, and those were cut off by the Japanese shortly after Pearl Harbor.<br />Gen. Douglas MacArthur orchestrated the defense of the Philippines from Corregidor during the early years of the war, but in March 1942, with the Philippines all but lost, he was ordered to evacuate, leaving behind some 78,000 troops to face the brutal Japanese. Fast-forward three years to the Allies’ island-hopping campaign to beat them back. “Taking back the Philippines—an island chain MacArthur had called home for years—would be the crowning achievement of his campaign to drive the Japanese out of the archipelago,” Mr. Maurer writes. “And taking back Corregidor would prove his valor.”<br />This was the mission of the 503rd in February 1945. Because Corregidor was so well-prepared to ward off an attack by sea, the Allies decided that the paratroopers would make a strategic jump onto the flat top of the island, giving the Americans both the element of surprise and the high ground above the Japanese defenders, most of whom were sheltered in the tunnels and batteries that dotted the steep ravines below. They could then proceed to root out the Japanese, securing the island and the rest of the Philippines.<br />To piece together the details of the intense fighting that followed, Mr. Maurer leans on the memoirs of three veterans of the 503rd: First Lt. Bill Calhoun; Capt. Charlie Bradford, a battalion surgeon; and Pfc. Anthony Lopez, the only one of the three still alive to confirm the story when Mr. Maurer was conducting his research. “As the C-47 approached . . . tracer rounds from a Japanese machine gun streaked past the wing,” Mr. Maurer writes of the initial assault. Bradford “cleared the plane without issue and felt the reassuring tug of the risers as his parachute opened and slowed his descent. The noise of the engine faded and all Bradford heard was the wind. He scanned the area under his boots. Bomb craters and ruins. It looked like a giant had punched holes in the top of the island.”</td>

      <td>What prompted so many ordinary Americans to march to war? A belief in a sacred cause.</td>
      <td>In the best-known line of his Second Inaugural Address, Abraham Lincoln expressed his desire to bind up the nation’s wounds “with malice toward none; with charity for all.” A few sentences before, in less remembered words, he emphasized the tragedy of so much blood being shed by Americans who, though divided into warring factions, were identical in fundamental ways: “Both read from the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other.” In our more secular age, Lincoln’s remark about the Bible may seem a mere platitude. For his listeners at the U.S. Capitol, however, and the millions more who would read his words in their newspapers, it touched a resonant spiritual chord.<br />In “A Holy Baptism of Fire and Blood,” James Byrd, a professor of religious history at Vanderbilt University’s divinity school, makes clear that Americans of the 1860s were saturated with an all-encompassing religiosity that colored for them virtually every aspect of the war. A tight writer with a good eye for the pointed quote, Mr. Byrd has clearly read hundreds, if not thousands, of sermons delivered in both the North and South, as well as countless letters by churchmen and soldiers. Both sides, he persuasively argues, understood the Civil War as a spiritual event as much as a military and political one. “Americans were never in more disagreement over the Bible, and yet never more in agreement that the Bible proved the sacredness of war,” Mr. Byrd writes. In the minds and hearts of most, “it was a biblical war.”<br />Confederate preachers conflated the South with Jesus, Exodus with secession and Yankees with the biblical Philistines. Black Christians equated Exodus with their own hope to escape from slavery. Both black and white Abolitionists cited St. Paul’s assertion that God “hath made of one blood all nations of men” as a scriptural mandate for emancipation. Southerners retorted with the Bible’s many uncritical references to slavery and insisted that bondage was part of God’s sacred plan to convert Africans to Christianity. Declared James Furman, a prominent Baptist minister in South Carolina: “The negro is not your equal, unless the Bible be untrue.”<br />It was as if, Mr. Byrd says, Christians needed war to truly understand both Scripture and God. Going to war, preached a Massachusetts minister in 1863, “is the most direct method of unrolling the scroll of God’s purposes.” Christian literalists believed that analogies could always be found between events in the war and passages in the Bible; they contended that the war had a divine purpose, however inscrutable it seemed at any given moment. Thus death on the battlefield was a holy sacrifice with transcendental meaning.<br />Although Mr. Byrd draws on Catholic, Jewish, Mormon and Quaker sources, he inevitably relies mostly on Protestant ones, given that the vast majority of Americans in the Civil War era belonged to one or another Protestant sect and had been profoundly affected by the revivalist movements of the salvation-oriented Second Great Awakening earlier in the 1800s. In “Sacred Scripture, Sacred War” (2013), Mr. Byrd wrote about the Bible during the American Revolution. In “A Holy Baptism of Fire and Blood” he usefully compares the differing ways in which churchmen exploited Scripture to justify the respective wars. Reflecting the 19th century’s surging preoccupation with the New Testament, he says, Civil War-era pastors appealed much less frequently than their Revolutionary forebears to the warlike passages of the Old Testament. The shift challenged churchmen to reconcile Jesus’ largely pacifist message with the desire to justify a savage war in Christian terms.</td>

He praised the video the president made earlier this week condemning violence, adding that he wished he had released it earlier.<br />Mr. Trump, in a speech to thousands of protesters gathered near the Washington Monument on Jan. 6, falsely asserted he had won the election and urged his supporters to march to the Capitol, where lawmakers were certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral victory. As the protesters began breaching security lines, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Pence on Twitter for not blocking the certification. After hundreds had broken into the Capitol, Mr. Trump called on the rioters to remain peaceful and avoid violence.<br />But later that day, the president tweeted, “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long.”<br />Mr. Kudlow joined the ranks of administration officials who have publicly criticized the president’s actions in relation to the riot. Three cabinet secretaries and several senior officials across the administration have stepped down in the aftermath of the attack.</td>

      <td>For centuries black Americans debated how to overcome racism—but they always emphasized human agency and individual responsibility.</td>
      <td>The civil-rights movement, led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., helped deliver America from the historic sins of slavery and Jim Crow by forcing the nation to confront the full humanity of its black citizens. King’s words and actions glorified America by transfiguring its racial wound and revealing its redemptive promise. Yet today many black leaders have lost sight of King altogether and are aiding and abetting the crucifixion of their own people. Rather than hope, they see despair; rather than the Easter Sunday of true liberation, they offer the bleak Good Friday of never-ending misery.<br />The history of black American responses to slavery and Jim Crow generally followed three paths. They were hotly debated, but all emphasized human agency, sought liberation, and rejected despair.<br />First, there were the recolonization or “back to Africa” movements championed by the likes of Marcus Garvey. These movements sought an exit from America.<br />Second, there were the insurrectionists of the 19th century, who believed that black Americans should engage in armed rebellion or vocal opposition so that they might find a home in this country. Here lie Nat Turner and, later, W.E.B. Du Bois. They wanted to have their resistant voice heard in America.<br />Third, there were accommodationist movements of the sort undertaken by Booker T. Washington, who thought that loyalty to America was the best course.</td>

      <td>VOA aired a ‘news’ report in Pakistan that was no more than a repackaged Biden campaign ad.</td>
      <td>The polarization that led to last week’s calamity on Capitol Hill has many underlying causes, but one stood out to me: America’s partisan media. During the last election, it was obvious that nearly every news outlet was in the tank for one candidate or the other. Half the country lived in one reality and the other half in another—with dire consequences. In my capacity as director of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees the government’s five international broadcast networks, I grappled directly with the polarizing forces that make truth-seeking journalism so difficult.<br />The task of these networks is to tell the truth to parts of the world where that isn’t permitted, notably China, Iran, North Korea and Cuba. They differ from commercial networks in two crucial ways. First, they are entirely funded by the U.S. taxpayer. Second, they are required by law to provide objective, balanced and comprehensive coverage.<br />The presidential election raised the stakes. In one instance, a whistleblower told my office about a troubling video report by the Urdu-language service of Voice of America, which is intended to reach Pakistan with objective news. The report repackaged a Biden campaign commercial, appealing to Muslims in Michigan to swing the state for the Democrat—in apparent violation of the VOA’s legal charter. Such naked politicking goes beyond bias, and surely VOA employees knew that. As a Trump appointee, I would never have permitted a pro-Trump campaign ad to be broadcast on the VOA. The VOA took the video down at our direction, though weeks later versions were still on their social media platforms.<br />When we launched an internal investigation of those responsible for the pro-Biden Urdu report, the journalists and managers inside the VOA rebelled, using their contacts in the media and in Congress. There was an unending flood of leaks, false press accounts, baseless lawsuits and inquiries from Capitol Hill. In the end, for the first time in decades, those responsible for biased reporting, from the most junior reporters to senior managers, faced consequences.<br />I came to see that the crisis affecting U.S. international broadcasting is part of the transformation of the media away from the old standards of objectivity and balance. The journalists my agency oversees look up to the most prestigious members of mainstream media: the Washington Post,  New York Times ,  NPR, CNN. These organizations are nakedly and unapologetically partisan and networks like VOA follow their lead. American taxpayers can’t be expected to continue to spend close to $1 billion a year for the government equivalent of MSNBC.</td>

They won’t. An obvious reason for the long delay and politicking over WHO’s invitation was to make sure word was dispatched down the bureaucracy to let local officials and medics know what they were supposed to say.<br />The real challenge now, which I doubt will enlist much Chinese cooperation, is to ransack China’s inventory of patient and autopsy samples from before the Wuhan outbreak to find out where and when the new virus manifested itself without being recognized.<br />Other countries have been willing to do this outside of China. We know the virus was present in France in December 2019 before the Wuhan eruption. A woman with a characteristic Covid rash who turned up at a Milan hospital in November 2019 has been identified as Italy’s possible Patient Zero; some blood samples suggest the virus may have been present since September 2019.<br />In comments to the press, WHO officials have alluded to the assumption that China has collected such samples too and hasn’t made the results public. Don’t hold your breath. Chinese officials now delight in suggesting, based on such evidence, that the virus started elsewhere. China gets credit for alerting the world to its existence. Guess what? Anything is possible until we establish some pattern in unrecognized early cases.</td>

Shortly after Mr. Pence was hustled out of the Senate Chambers, Mr. Chansley entered the room, climbed to Mr. Pence’s dais, and posed for photographs, prosecutors said.<br />According to prosecutors, Mr. Chansley, 33 years old, also left a note for Mr. Pence: “it’s only a matter of time, justice is coming.”<br />Prosecutors had initially said in court filings that Mr. Chansley and other rioters intended to capture and assassinate lawmakers at the Capitol. On Friday, Michael Sherwin, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, which is leading the sprawling investigation, said there was no direct evidence of capture and kill teams.<br />The new information about the role of Mr. Chansley—whose painted face and colorful attire made him the most recognizable participant in the riot—came in a detention brief filed by prosecutors on Thursday.</td>

The Mexican Attorney General’s Office said Thursday it had investigated the general and found no connection to organized crime or any suspicious increase in his net worth.<br />Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Friday the evidence wasn’t solid enough to arrest the general much less convict him in a Mexican court.<br />Mr. López Obrador went further, saying the DEA concocted the case. He accused the agency of either “consciously or unconsciously” sabotaging the relationship with Mexico when it didn’t inform the Mexican government of its investigation.</td>

      <td>I respectfully disagree with Leon Kass’s argument in “Exodus and American Nationhood” (Review, Jan. 9). The religious argument he puts forward is profoundly misplaced. The American tradition of civic republicanism isn’t rooted in Judeo-Christian values or the Puritans’ devotion to the Hebrew Bible, but in the Lockean tradition of individual rights. Our Founding Fathers were mostly influenced by deism. One need only to read the U.S. Constitution, Amendment I, to see how wrong Mr. Kass’s views are, and how determined our founders were to guarantee our individual rights from governmental or religious tyranny.<br />Mr. Kass’s equating atheism and political fanaticism is disgraceful. Mr. Kass claims that “with both atheism and political fanaticism on the rise in Western societies, we may soon discover what happens should humanity return to the dehumanizing pre-Biblical alternatives whose modern equivalents lurk offstage.” President Trump’s dangerous photo op on June 1, 2020, in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, Bible in hand, as well as his widespread support among Christian Evangelicals, Christian Zionists and the Israeli government all serve as stark reminders of the dangerous nature of religion. I doubt that all the terrorists who violently stormed the U.S. Capitol last week were atheists.<br />Finally, Mr. Kass’s assertion that “for most of its history, America was a nation characterized by reverence as much as by liberty” belies history. I am particularly disappointed to read a University of Chicago professor emeritus so willfully disregard our history of the genocide of Native Americans, 250 years of slavery and a century of Jim Crow laws that terrorized African-Americans. In today’s current reckoning with structural racism, Mr. Kass’s argument is off base.<br />Jennifer A. Lind<br />Wilmette, Ill.</td>

That makes their prices extremely sensitive to momentum in the global economy and Chinese growth. China is the world’s largest commodity consumer by far and is responsible for about half of global demand for copper and other metals.<br />After China largely contained the coronavirus, its economy has motored ahead of the rest of the world recently, making it a rare bright spot. That has sparked the rally in metals, pushing up copper 25% in the last six months as part of a vast rise in riskier markets.<br />In another sign of sentiment in metals markets, shares of copper miner  Freeport-McMoRan Inc.  have more than doubled in the last six months and are already up 17% so far this year. Many analysts look at the performance of mining stocks to gauge sentiment because they are more accessible to many investors than futures contracts, which expire every month and are more complex.</td>

      <td>Medieval language was rich with allegory and metaphor, and those of the time often drew such types of connections to natural phenomena.</td>
      <td>I am disappointed by Amanda Foreman’s uncritical reporting of a supposed medieval superstition that the Perseid meteor shower was caused by St. Lawrence’s burning tears (“Awed by the Meteors of the New Year’s Sky,” Review, Jan. 2).<br />That people in the Middle Ages seriously believed the Perseids to be St. Lawrence’s tears is simply not true. Aristotle’s Meteorologica was well known in Latin translation in the Middle Ages, so his theory of exhalations would have been current.<br />Medieval language was rich with allegory and metaphor, and those of the time often drew such types of connections to natural phenomena (a similar concept: we moderns refer to the heart as the seat of feelings, despite our biological knowledge to the contrary).<br />The first source for this tradition, Edward Herrick, wrote in 1839 when the Scientific Revolution was well under way. As was often the case in the 19th century, he misinterpreted the allegory of ages past for superstitious beliefs about the nature of the universe. Discussions of history should reflect the better understanding we now have of medieval idiom and style.<br />Timothy Lesinski</td>

      <td>The president and allies are simultaneously preparing for his White House departure and Senate trial</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Shortly after becoming the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice, President Trump summoned political advisers and demanded to know more about the 10 Republicans who had voted against him.<br />Mr. Trump, who had feared an even larger number of defections, wanted to know who the lawmakers were and whether he had ever done anything for them, according to people familiar with the meeting. He also inquired who might run against them when they face re-election in two years, the people said.<br />The president has grown increasingly concerned with defections against him within his own party, aides say. Now, he must plot his defense in a second Senate trial that will hinge on his level of GOP support, with far fewer legal and political allies than the last time he was impeached. Mr. Trump has called several Republicans on Capitol Hill in recent days to seek their advice on who he should recruit, as the personal attorneys who defended him last time and White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, have made clear to associates they don’t intend to serve on his team, according to people familiar with the discussions.<br />Advisers have urged the president not to tap Rudy Giuliani, his personal attorney who—to the chagrin of several Trump advisers—led the campaign to overturn the results of the election, telling Mr. Trump that he needs a sophisticated attorney who can stick to the facts.<br />Some advisers have discussed John Eastman, a conservative constitutional law professor who was one of the few legal experts who told Mr. Trump that Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to block certain electors from being counted on Jan. 6, as a possible defense attorney, according to a person familiar with the conversations.</td>

      <td>President-elect Joe Biden’s economic-relief plan places low-income families at its center, delivering cash, housing assistance, food and child-care support to the most vulnerable Americans. It is also a way for Democrats to get some long-sought priorities into law.<br />Mr. Biden released his $1.9 trillion plan on Thursday, urging Congress to help states, provide money to households and accelerate vaccinations in the early days of his administration. Democrats applauded the package, but its legislative path is uncertain as Mr. Biden tries to find enough Republican support in the Senate to overcome procedural hurdles.<br />Democrats, who will have slim House and Senate majorities, can muscle much of the plan through Congress if bipartisan talks stall or collapse. They gained that power by winning control of the Senate, giving them the opportunity to merge their response to the pandemic with longstanding policies on redistribution and inequality. The ideas they are advancing include an increase in the child tax credit for low-income households and expanded paid leave for workers.<br />The Biden proposal and its money for vaccinations and households would address rising risks to the U.S. economic recovery, even if the final version is smaller than the $1.9 trillion plan, said Robard Williams, senior vice president of Moody’s Investors Service.<br />Recent economic data underscore the halting nature of the recovery. Retail sales fell for a third straight month in December, a report on Friday showed. The economy lost jobs in December, the Labor Department said last week, ending seven months of employment gains.</td>

      <td>Company’s IPO fueled by growth in at-home games and demand for new share offerings</td>
      <td>Shares of mobile game company  Playtika Holding Corp.  rose 17% in their market debut, fueled by growth in the videogame industry and soaring demand for new share offerings.<br />The Israel-based company’s stock closed at $31.62 a share, according to FactSet, above the company’s initial public offering price of $27 a share. Shares had opened Friday at $33.40, placing the company’s market value at $13.7 billion.<br />Playtika’s suite of smartphone games includes casino-style options such as “Caesars Slots,” “House of Fun” and “Poker Heat.” The company, founded a decade ago, saw its revenue rise 28% to $1.8 billion for the first nine months of 2020 compared with a year earlier. Profit fell 94%, hurt by higher costs and expenses, though it has been profitable for years, unlike most of its tech peers that have recently gone public.<br />“Probably one difference from most companies going public is that we have real cash flow,” said Craig Abrahams, Playtika’s president and finance chief, in an interview, adding that now Playtika will gain a larger balance sheet, enabling it to do more deals and reward its employees with equity. “It gives us a lot of flexibility.”<br />In 2016, Playtika was acquired for $4.4 billion in cash by a Chinese consortium including an affiliate of videogame developer Giant Interactive Group and a private-equity firm set up by  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  founder Jack Ma.</td>

In an open letter to the companies, the health ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia said the incident was unacceptable and risked undermining the credibility of the vaccine rollout, which is already facing public distrust.<br />The German government said in a statement that it deplored what it called the short notice and unexpected news, noting that Pfizer was failing to meet a contractual obligation.<br />“The company has made a binding commitment to a delivery schedule until mid-February,” the statement said.</td>

      <td>Facebook-owned messaging service acknowledges confusion among users over changes in its handling of data</td>
      <td>WhatsApp is delaying a controversial update to its privacy policy following backlash from some users over how it would share data with  Facebook Inc.,  which owns the popular messaging service.<br />The company said its roughly two billion users would have until May 15 to review and accept the new policy, which is when the data changes are set to go into effect. If users don’t consent by then, the app will eventually stop working for them, a spokesman said. The previous deadline for accepting the changes was Feb. 8.<br />“We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update,” a WhatsApp spokesman said. “There’s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts.”<br />WhatsApp said the new policy isn’t geared to expanding its ability to share data with Facebook but rather to allowing businesses that interact with customers on WhatsApp to store those conversations on Facebook servers. The move was a key step in Facebook’s plan to generate revenue with the app after many years of struggling to do so. Businesses will also be able to store user shopping activity on the servers.<br />The apparent user resistance and confusion about the new policy point to the difficulty the service faces in advancing on a profit-generating path. Even as WhatsApp remains a market leader in messaging, competition among encrypted messaging platforms is intensifying with privacy concerns growing as a key consideration for users.</td>

      <td>Operation Warp Speed leaders waited more than two months to approve a plan to distribute and administer Covid-19 vaccines proposed by U.S. health officials, administration officials said, leaving states with little time to implement a mass-vaccination campaign amid a coronavirus surge.<br />State and local officials had been clamoring for months for help preparing for the largest vaccination program in U.S. history when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a playbook in September to guide them.<br />The CDC had wanted to start helping states plan in June how to get people vaccinated. But officials at Operation Warp Speed rebuffed the agency’s plan for distributing vaccines. They adopted a similar plan in August only after exploring other options—and then held the release of the CDC’s playbook for states for two weeks for additional clearance and to put it out with another document, the officials said.<br />Operation Warp Speed was supposed to be a high-water mark of the Trump administration’s coronavirus response, but it stumbled at the finish line because of problems in federal planning and foresight. Now, the public-private partnership is scrambling to speed up vaccinations, adjusting eligibility guidelines while states race to increase their abilities to administer doses on a large scale.<br />“They didn’t plan for the last inch of the last mile, the part that matters most—how you’re going to actually vaccinate that many people quickly,” said Dr. Bruce Gellin, a former Health and Human Services vaccine official and president of global immunization at the Sabin Vaccine Institute.</td>
