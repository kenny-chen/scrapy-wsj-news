      <td>A vote is likely this week on a one-week continuing resolution</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Lawmakers expect to pass a one-week spending bill soon that would keep the government funded through Dec. 18 and buy more time for complex, year-end negotiations on a long-term funding measure and coronavirus relief.<br />Congressional leaders had hoped to pass a full-year spending bill this week, before the government’s current funding runs out at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. But lawmakers are still ironing out disputes over both the sprawling spending bill and a coronavirus relief package that they hope to attach to it.<br />On Sunday, a House Democratic leadership aide said that lawmakers would likely vote this week on a one-week continuing resolution, or short-term spending bill. Leaders want to combine a coronavirus aid package with the full-year spending bill, both of which require some more time.<br />Senior lawmakers on the appropriations committee had been signaling last week that the full-year spending bill needed more work and likely wouldn’t be ready by the Dec. 11 deadline. Republicans and Democrats have been hashing out differences over funding for construction of the wall along the border with Mexico, detention beds for immigrants and environmental provisions, among other matters.<br />House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said last week that they hoped to attach coronavirus relief to the full-year spending package, a compendium of the 12 bills needed to fund the government known as an omnibus.</td>

The U.S. Supreme Court last month heard arguments in the case. The Trump administration has asked the court to strike down large swaths of the ACA.<br />Mr. Becerra, 62 years old, served in the House of Representatives from 1993 to 2017. A spokeswoman for Mr. Becerra didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment.<br />A spokesman for the Biden transition team declined to comment.<br />The nominee will play a pivotal role in driving Mr. Biden’s health agenda and helping to shape the new administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Then one of the counties rechecked its math, and Ms. Tenney recaptured the lead. And last week, nearly a month after Election Day, officials in rural Chenango County said they had found 55 new unopened ballots.<br />The contest for New York’s 22nd District—one of just two in the nation where no winner has been declared—might take additional weeks to resolve, and it is possible that State Supreme Court Justice Scott DelConte could order a full recount, which neither candidate is seeking.<br />Already, the election has highlighted deficiencies in New York’s electoral procedures and let Ms. Tenney, who has a history of making incendiary remarks, advance conservative claims about voting irregularities. The Republican won a seat in the House in 2016 but lost a re-election bid to Mr. Brindisi in 2018.</td>

Earlier on Sunday, Mr. Trump had said on Twitter that Mr. Giuliani had tested positive for the coronavirus.<br />Mr. Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney, has been traveling on behalf of the president’s unprecedented push to reverse his election loss, attending hearings in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan and Georgia. Two Republican state senators in Pennsylvania who attended a Nov. 25 meeting with Mr. Giuliani have since said they tested positive.

      <td>Ruling party politicians are expected to take most of the 277 seats in the National Assembly</td>
      <td>Venezuela’s authoritarian regime staged congressional elections Sunday that were expected to give President Nicolás Maduro complete control of all levers of power in a vote the country’s opposition and its supporters, including the U.S., rejected as fraudulent.<br />Until now Venezuela’s single-chamber congress, the National Assembly, had been the only government body under opposition leadership. But with Mr. Maduro’s regime having handed control of opposition parties to allies and exiled or jailed prominent adversaries, most opposition leaders called on their countrymen to boycott the vote in protest even if it meant the regime would dominate all of government and the armed forces.<br />The outcome has never really been in doubt in a country whose government is closely allied to Communist Cuba, Vladimir Putin’s Russia and Iran. Except for a few breakaway candidates not allied with Mr. Maduro, ruling party politicians are expected to take the vast majority of the 277 seats in the National Assembly.<br />“Venezuela’s electoral fraud has already been committed,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday afternoon on his official  Twitter  account. “The results announced by the illegitimate Maduro regime will not reflect the will of the Venezuelan people. What’s happening today is a fraud and a sham, not an election.”<br />As in recent elections in Venezuela, there were no traditional international monitors, and the members of the electoral council had been chosen without the participation of Mr. Maduro’s opponents. Venezuelans have also expressed distrust in the voting system, which in 2017 was rocked by allegations of fraud after the London-based company that provided electronic machines, Smartmatic, said the regime had doctored a million of the 8.1 million votes cast in an election.</td>

      <td>China has boasted the world’s second-largest arms-manufacturing industry for the past five years, ranking behind the U.S. in sales but outstripping Russia and the top European nations, according to a report released Sunday by a Swedish think tank.<br />In its annual study of arms sales, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) for the first time released figures for individual Chinese defense firms.<br />The study found that sales of arms and military services by the global sector’s 25 largest companies for which data are available totaled $361 billion last year, an 8.5% increase over 2018. SIPRI is an independent arms-trade analyst.<br />Among those companies, four are Chinese and 12 are American. Those Chinese companies had combined sales of $56.7 billion in 2019, compared with $221.2 billion from the U.S. companies. Two of the top 25 firms are Russian, with combined sales of $13.9 billion.<br />SIPRI figures showed that revenues for Chinese defense manufacturers have failed to keep pace with the global growth, with the top four Chinese firms growing by 4.8% last year. However, SIPRI’s data on Chinese firms excludes inaccessible sales figures from major companies in missile manufacturing and shipbuilding.</td>

      <td>The former defense minister is released in another loss for the drug war.</td>
      <td>At a West Point ceremony in November 2018, the U.S. Defense Department conferred the Legion of Merit on Mexico’s then-secretary of national defense, Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos. Less than two years later, on Oct. 15, the retired Mexican four-star was arrested in Los Angeles on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges.<br />A grand jury in the Eastern District of New York had handed up an indictment of Gen. Cienfuegos on Aug. 14, 2019, for crimes allegedly committed between December 2015 and February 2017. The indictment remained sealed until his arrest.<br />On Oct. 16, requesting a “permanent order of detention,” Acting U.S. Attorney Seth D. DuCharme alleged before the New York court that “while holding public office in Mexico, the defendant used his official position to assist the H-2 Cartel, a notorious Mexican drug cartel, in exchange for bribes.”<br />U.S. prosecutors insist they had what they needed to convict Gen. Cienfuegos, who was an active member of the Mexican military during the six years (2012-18) he held the cabinet-level post in the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto. But on Nov. 17, Attorney General William Barr dropped the case. The general was released and on Nov. 18 returned to Mexico, where the government has said it will investigate the charges. The odds of that happening are pretty long.<br />Chalk up one more loss for the futile, half-century-old U.S. war on drugs. In this case, the circular logic out of Washington is that keeping Mexico as a U.S. partner in fighting transnational crime trumps actual crime fighting. The good news for the drug-war bureaucracy is that its jobs program is secure.</td>

      <td>Misguided opposition in the Senate bodes ill for U.S. Mideast policy in the Biden administration.</td>
      <td>Senate opposition to the proposed U.S. arms sales to the United Arab Emirates reflects a dangerous reversion to the Obama-era understanding of the Middle East. While opponents of the deal claim that the Emirates have misused other U.S. weapons in Yemen, the real issue is much broader.<br />A Senate vote on legislation to halt the $23 billion arms deal is expected in days. While opposition will likely fail—even if the bill passes, supermajorities would be needed to override the expected presidential veto—the thinking behind it foreshadows an ill-advised Biden administration policy toward Iran.<br />The Iranian threat to regional peace and security has altered the strategic reality of the Middle East since the misbegotten 2015 nuclear deal. Arab states increasingly fear Tehran’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, but also its support for terrorism in Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, as well as its conventional military activities. The decision by Bahrain and the U.A.E. to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel shows how Iran’s increased—and largely unchallenged—belligerence has realigned the Middle East’s correlation of forces.<br />Many of these shifts stem from the nuclear deal, which released between $120 billion and $150 billion in frozen assets and freed Iran from arduous economic sanctions, providing Tehran the resources to expand its military and clandestine capabilities. Iran’s Quds Force used its share of the windfall to beef up support for Iraqi Shiite militias, Syria’s Assad, and Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria. In response, the Emirates and other U.S. friends rightly want more-advanced arms.<br />Less reported, but of vital importance to the Gulf Cooperation Council’s six Arab member states, was Iran’s dramatic expansion of support for Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Previous Iranian aid to the Houthis had been intended to stalemate Saudi and Emirati efforts to install a stable, pro-GCC government in San’a, but in 2017 Tehran ramped up shipments of sophisticated weaponry that could strike far beyond Yemen’s borders. This threatened Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure; important civilian airports in Riyadh, Dubai and Abu Dhabi; and commercial shipping in the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, critical sea lanes to the Suez Canal.</td>

      <td>The best option may be to inoculate those over 65 with a focus on low-income communities.</td>
      <td>A remarkable achievement is at hand: the introduction of two vaccines that have been shown in trials to be highly effective at preventing symptomatic Covid disease. These vaccines will arrive less than a year after the initial sequencing of the virus. For several months the demand will outstrip the supply. Doses will have to be rationed. What’s the most equitable way to allocate this scarce resource?<br />Once the vaccine is approved, manufacturing will ramp up quickly and distribution will start. By spring there may be enough supply to vaccinate about 50 million people a month. But initially, there won’t be enough doses to vaccinate everyone at risk of Covid complications. I am on the board of  Pfizer ,  which developed one of these vaccines. Policy makers, ethicists and clinicians will have to come up with a plan for whom to vaccinate first.<br />Decisions on allocating vaccines are up to the states, but their plans must be approved by the federal government. The vaccine supply will be divvied up based on state population size. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will issue guidelines outlining priority populations and the order in which to vaccinate them. The CDC’s guidelines aren’t binding but will heavily influence state decision-making.<br />Goals include preserving human life, reducing the size and scope of the epidemic, and mitigating health disparities, especially among low-income Americans. Blacks, Hispanics and indigenous communities are bearing a disproportionate share of the disease and death.<br />Many of those hardest hit are essential workers who continued working through the pandemic. They couldn’t go without paychecks. They couldn’t work from home. As a result, they have died from Covid in higher numbers.</td>

      <td>Congress has made clear that Nazi expropriation victims can bring lawsuits.</td>
      <td>On Monday’s anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases that provide an opportunity to protect America’s enduring role in securing justice for the victims of the Axis powers.<br />The cases arise out of Nazi Germany’s well-documented campaign to seize art and other property. Federal Republic of Germany v. Philipp was brought by heirs of Frankfurt-based Jewish art dealers who were coerced by Hermann Goering into “selling” a collection of medieval Christian devotional objects—called the Guelph Treasure, or Welfenschatz—to the state of Prussia in 1935. Goering gave the trove to Hitler as a gift. Republic of Hungary v. Simon was brought by 14 Holocaust survivors seeking compensation for the seizure of their property as they boarded cattle cars to Auschwitz.<br />At issue is whether U.S. courts should evaluate these claims for expropriation on the merits, as Congress has directed, or whether—as Germany and Hungary urge—courts are free to refrain from doing so out of “international comity.”<br />The answer is clear. As the justices explained in Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria (1983), Congress has the “undisputed” prerogative and power “to decide, as a matter of federal law, whether and under what circumstances foreign nations should be amenable to suit in the United States.” In 1976 Congress passed the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which commands that “a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States” when, among other things, claims involve “rights in property taken in violation of international law.” In the Holocaust Victims Redress Act of 1998, Congress expressly found that “the Nazis’ policy of looting art was a critical element and incentive in their campaign of genocide”—a clear international-law violation.<br />Congress has passed numerous laws specifically to facilitate redress for Holocaust victims, including the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016, which extended the statute of limitations for such claims. Congress unambiguously intended for Holocaust victims and their heirs to be able to bring these claims against foreign sovereigns in U.S. courts.</td>

      <td>To stay on top, says a progressive writer, the U.S. must triple its population. Maybe so. But does he mean it?</td>
      <td>Six years ago Matthew Yglesias co-founded the news and policy website Vox. That venture, begun when Obama-era progressivism appeared to have vanquished all before it, was designed not to argue for liberal policies but patiently to “explain” them to a young and receptive online audience. In November Mr. Yglesias announced—because in the era of social media you announce these things—that he was leaving Vox and starting his own venture on Substack, a subscription-based online platform.<br />I am not typically in sympathy with Mr. Yglesias’s views, but he is a lucid writer and enough of a contrarian for even a conservative like me to appreciate and learn from. He is, moreover, one of several journalists on the left recently to leave their employers for reasons of unwanted editorial control. His most recent book, “One Billion Americans: The Case for Thinking Bigger,” contends that the only way the United States can remain economically and culturally “number one”—his term—is to triple the country’s population to a billion.<br />Left-leaning writers ordinarily take a skeptical view of population increases—more people means more environmental degradation—whereas pro-natal policies are typically associated with the right. It’s noteworthy, whatever else can be said about his book, that so committed a progressive as Mr. Yglesias should take the view that America needs more babies.<br />And he’s right. It does. A declining birth rate makes robust economic growth harder to achieve, further strains the government’s ability to pay for social welfare programs and diminishes society’s capacity to flourish in the long term. Progressives, however, tend to worry more that social-welfare programs aren’t generous enough than that there isn’t enough revenue to pay for them. They are also wedded to an understanding of human relations that devalues procreation and the family as an institution at every turn. In this worldview, it’s not unfair to say, marriage is the formalization of emotional attachment, easily rescinded; access to inexpensive birth control is a fundamental human right; and abortion—the literal curtailment of the human population—is the sine qua non of a free society. This outlook has prevailed in Western countries for a long time. It may be good or bad, depending on your point of view, but it is not calculated to yield high birth rates.<br />Mr. Yglesias is not prepared to offer even the mildest regrets for the fruits, or the lack of fruits, of his left-liberal orthodoxy. He is a policy maven and so he believes that a raft of federal and state policies, presumably implemented by smart people like himself, can reverse what it took the sexual revolution half a century to accomplish. Establish universal day care and pre-K education, mandate parental leave, keep schools open year round, and young couples will feel sufficiently at ease to start having lots of babies again.</td>

      <td>The Supreme Court extends in scrutiny of orders limiting the free exercise of religion to California and Kentucky.</td>
      <td>The media are still preoccupied with Donald Trump, but there is other news, some of it even good. One example is the Supreme Court’s new attention to violations of religious rights in the pandemic.<br />Late last week the Court vacated a ruling by a district court that upheld California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s sweeping restrictions on religious gatherings. The unsigned order remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court’s November ruling that enjoined similar restrictions in New York (Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo).<br />Mr. Newsom banned indoor worship services, small and large, for almost all Californians. But even as he strictly limited church attendance, he let liquor stores and cardrooms operate without capping the number of people allowed. This disparate treatment is what the Court scored in New York, and its intervention in California shows its growing impatience with limits on constitutional rights as the pandemic continues.<br />A separate case out of Kentucky gives the Court another chance to protect the free exercise of religion. In an executive order last month, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear shut down in-person instruction and private and public K-12 schools.

      <td>Government labor lawyers have clearly never run a business.</td>
      <td>Both parties in Washington are targeting tech firms, albeit for different political reasons. Last week the Trump Justice Department took its latest turn with a dubious civil-rights lawsuit against  Facebook .<br />Justice says Facebook’s hiring and recruitment practices discriminate against American citizens in favor of foreign H-1B visa holders seeking green cards. But if Facebook is guilty, the list of business culprits is going to be very long. “Facebook refused to recruit, consider, or hire qualified and available U.S. workers for over 2,600 positions that Facebook, instead, reserved for temporary visa holders it sponsored for permanent work authorization (or “green cards”) in connection with the permanent labor certification process (PERM),” Justice claims.<br />U.S. immigration law allows employers to offer permanent positions to high-skilled H-1B visa holders after six years by sponsoring them for green cards. However, Labor Department regulations require employers to show that they advertised the job to Americans and that there were no minimally qualified U.S. applicants.<br />“Qualified” is in the eye of the employer. According to DOJ, all applicants with the same amount of work experience and degree are equally qualified. Government attorneys have clearly never run a business. The DOJ complaint concedes that Facebook followed Labor’s regulations. Instead, it alleges that Facebook didn’t advertise positions belonging to foreign workers whom they wanted to sponsor for green cards as widely as it did some other job openings. As a result, few Americans applied for the foreign-workers’ positions.<br />Yet Justice produces no evidence that Facebook discriminated against American citizens. Facebook vigorously recruited U.S. workers for thousands of open positions. Facebook merely sought to retain foreigners who had been employed at the company for many years instead of taking a flyer on newcomers. What’s wrong with that?</td>

      <td>Can voters ignore the state constitution when passing an initiative?</td>
      <td>The outcome of the presidential race isn’t the only election result being contested in Arizona, and the other has even greater consequences for the law. Last week two lawsuits were filed against Proposition 208, the ballot initiative that imposes a new 3.5% tax surcharge to raise an estimated $827 million for education. It passed with 51.7% of the vote.<br />The suits are challenging whether Prop 208, which passed as a statute, must conform to the state constitution. One suit was filed by businesswoman Ann Siner and retired judge John Buttrick, the other by the Goldwater Institute, the influential Arizona think tank.<br />The suits claim that Prop 208 contradicts a constitutional amendment that limits the amount of revenue provided to school districts each year. It also overrides another constitutional provision requiring a two-thirds majority of the Legislature to approve a tax increase.<br />The Legislative Council, a nonpartisan legislative office that reviews bills and ballot measures for form and constitutionality, held that Prop 208’s language exempting the money it raises from an existing cap on education spending “is likely invalid” because it violates express constitutional limits. Supporters went ahead anyway. The state Supreme Court declined to rule on claims that Prop 208 unconstitutionally curtails the Legislature’s authority but said it couldn’t consider the issue until it passed.<br />Prop 208 supporters say the people are sovereign and have spoken through the initiative. But the suits argue that, though the people are sovereign, they still have to obey their own laws and constitution.</td>

      <td>Schumer and Menendez block a deal to bring Sudan closer to the West.</td>
      <td>When the White House announced in October that Sudan planned to normalize relations with Israel, it showed that the peace movement could extend beyond the Persian Gulf. The northeast African country is changing for the better, but a pair of self-interested Senators could derail this progress.<br />Sudan had been a geopolitical nightmare for most of dictator Omar al-Bashir’s 30 years in power. He fell last year, and Abdalla Hamdok, an economist and reformer, became Prime Minister. A quarter-century after the country hosted Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, the transitional government is opening up civil society and promising democratic elections in 2022.<br />Washington and Khartoum have negotiated a broad deal to improve ties. On top of the agreement with Jerusalem, Sudan has put $335 million in an escrow account to pay victims of al Qaeda’s 1998 U.S. embassy bombings. In exchange the U.S. would lift its state sponsor of terrorism designation and restore Sudan’s sovereign immunity. The deal would open the country to foreign investment, which its shrinking economy desperately needs. But Congress needs to approve.<br />Mr. Hamdok leads a fragile government and has survived an assassination attempt. Many Islamists are unhappy with his turn to the West, and some problematic officials from the Bashir era remain influential. It could be tough for the reformer to keep pushing change—or even remain in office—if the agreement falls through and his legitimacy becomes questionable. Israeli-Sudanese normalization would be off the table, and Sudan’s currently poor ties with Iran would likely warm up.<br />This seems like an easy U.S. call, and the deal has overwhelming support on Capitol Hill. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) blocked a bipartisan legal-peace bill in September on grounds that 9/11 victims would no longer be able to pursue claims against Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism. Yet the compromise bill would have let victims use the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (Jasta) to pursue Sudan alongside Saudi Arabia. Some of the 9/11 victims’ lawyers found this compromise acceptable.</td>

Chick-fil-A is seeking unspecified damages and to recoup legal fees, according to the lawsuit.<br />A Tyson spokesman said Chick-fil-A’s claims were unfounded and that Tyson would defend against them. A Perdue spokeswoman and a Sanderson Farms spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for Pilgrim’s didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />The lawsuit adds one of the U.S. poultry industry’s biggest customers to a four-year legal battle over alleged collusion among companies that produce the bulk of the roughly 37 billion pounds of chicken consumed annually in the U.S.<br />Major supermarket operators and food-service distributors have filed civil suits alleging anticompetitive behavior, and this year the U.S. Justice Department indicted senior chicken-industry executives and sales officials on criminal charges of bid-rigging and price-fixing.

      <td>Without traditional campus life and classes, some students postpone education; ‘You need to have a plan,’ a counselor says, but even part-time jobs are hard to find</td>
      <td>When New York University moved many classes online amid the pandemic, a group of third-year film and drama students at the school took things into their own hands. Reluctant to tackle a semester of what they labeled “Zoom Shakespeare” and “Zoom Treasure Island,” they began researching where to live and work together inexpensively. “We wanted to create an environment where we [could] riff off each other,” said Marina Fess, an acting major.<br />The students organized a creative collective in Vermont without oversight or advice from professors or NYU, which isn’t awarding academic credit for the three-month stint.<br />Many students elsewhere also took action, choosing either to postpone college or interrupt their studies to work as proofreaders, long-distance tutors, campaign volunteers, researchers and DoorDash delivery people. Some are pursuing passions like drone piloting.<br />During Covid, the decision to take a gap year or semester before or during college is complicated. With many school policies in flux, tuition refunds or credits aren’t always a given and students who have secured scholarships may be hesitant to defer. At some schools, students who take time off may risk losing the chance to enroll whenever they like, and could have to resubmit financial aid applications the following academic year. Finding gap-year activities also is harder now. Even part-time jobs can be tough to land and the pandemic has suspended or limited many traditional pursuits, like travel or international volunteer programs.<br />Jill Tipograph, co-founder of Early Stage Careers, a career coaching service for college students and young professionals, says both high-school seniors who postpone college and mid-college students putting their education on pause should commit to activities that develop their skills and maturity. She suggests that they map out their gap period and how to structure their days. “You need to have a plan,” Ms. Tipograph says. “You can’t just take time off.”</td>

      <td>Democrats devise magic ‘multipliers’ to justify spending, but the returns never show.</td>
      <td>Wait for it . . . any day now . . . get ready for the “multipliers.” You know, the idea that a government dollar spent magically turns into multiple dollars in the economy. We ought to start hearing that silly word again as the lame-duck coronavirus stimulus negotiations kick in. Expect more multiplier mumbo jumbo as the Biden administration begins its tax-and-spend fiesta.<br />Let’s face it, the Democrats haven’t had a believable economic messenger since Robert Rubin during the Clinton administration. Since then they’ve presented a cast of characters—Larry Summers, Mr. Biden’s adviser Jared Bernstein, and lately Elizabeth Warren—who bend themselves into pretzels to justify higher spending and then higher taxes.<br />The  New York Times  described this trend during the early days of the Obama administration. The financial crisis team of Jason Furman, Tim Geithner and Mr. Summers were “carrying around this list of multipliers” taken from a chart by Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. Every dollar spent extending unemployment insurance benefits would, the fairy tale went, boost the economy by $1.64. Sadly, a dollar in reduced corporate taxes would boost the economy by only 30 cents. But cheer up, every dollar spent on food stamps would spur a $1.73 increase in gross domestic product. Mr. Zandi called it “bang for the buck”—the proverbial free lunch. It’s more like “dud for the dollar” because it didn’t work. It never does. Multipliers are a canard, a Keynesian conceit.<br />The economy grew after the Great Recession, as it does after every recession. The stimulus didn’t stimulate. Shovel-ready projects weren’t ready. Many complained that the stimulus wasn’t big enough. More hooey. The Obama administration’s high taxes and heaps of regulation held the economy back. Is spending driving today’s recovery? Think back to the Heroes Act 2.0, Nancy Pelosi’s $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Economic growth in the third quarter of 2020 was 33% as lockdowns were lifted, despite—or because of—that gigantic stimulus package not becoming law.<br />The theory of multipliers is based on the Keynesian view that poorer consumers tend to spend a large amount of increased income, and the rich less so. But multipliers are half a story. Someone has to put up the original money that allegedly gets multiplied, taking it away from the private sector and negating whatever dwindling chain of transactions are hypothesized. It’s like two waves canceling each other out—you can’t just do the math on the additive public wave and ignore subtracting the private. This demand-side theory omits the principle of productivity, the real driver of economic growth and prosperity.</td>

They accused Mr. Schumer and his colleagues of being soft. Signs urged him to “show some spine” and to resist “by any means necessary.”<br />Nearly every Democratic senator eventually complied.

Chris Murphy of Connecticut promised to “shatter precedent” to stymie nominations.<br />The result was unprecedented. As had been tradition, Presidents Clinton and Obama had nearly all of their cabinet confirmed in January. Mr. Clinton had 13 out of 14; Mr. Obama, 11 out of 15. Senate Democrats made sure Mr. Trump had only three.<br />Because the Democrats abolished the filibuster for confirmation votes in 2013, they couldn’t ultimately block any appointment without Republican support. But nominees faced a bombardment of endless “questions for the record.” Democrats voted en bloc against nominees in committee. They consistently refused to consent to routine floor votes, forcing the use of the cloture procedure, then made sure to use every minute of the 30 hours of postcloture debate to delay the confirmation vote as long as they could.</td>

California data provide an example. Between 2008 and 2018 the volume of hospital care purchased by commercial insurers declined by 15% while their payments (and prices) to hospitals increased by 283%. Much of this increase is due to the growing power of large systems. In many markets across the U.S., insurance companies have no choice but to contract with dominant health systems—at above-market rates—to offer health plans that meet network adequacy requirements demanded by regulators and employers.<br />We need limited but targeted regulations to restore competition to provider markets if the GOP model of limited government control can work. Otherwise the public, which doesn’t currently support a government-run system, will see no other option.<br />Prof. Glenn Melnick<br />University of Southern California</td>

Saudi Arabia has denied the meeting took place, but Israel hasn’t. The Wall Street Journal reported that Prince Mohammed pulled back from a deal during the encounter, largely because of the U.S. election result.<br />In a fiery address at the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal condemned Israel as the last Western colonizer of the Middle East. He disparaged its claims of upholding human rights and enumerated decades of crimes committed against the Palestinians.<br />“They’re demolishing homes as they wish and they assassinate whomever they want, and yet the Israeli Knesset passed a law that defines the citizenship of Israel as exclusively Jewish, denying the non-Jewish inhabitants of Israel of equal rights under the law,” Prince Turki said. “What kind of democracy is that?”<br />He prefaced his remarks by saying they represented his personal view, but as a senior prince who advises the Saudi king, his comments are closely monitored as a policy bellwether. Following criticism of Palestinian leaders by another senior Saudi royal in October, Prince Turki’s comments reveal the divergent views at the top echelons of the secretive kingdom toward warming relations with Israel.</td>

      <td>It’s hard to believe that the economy could survive and thrive during the state lockdowns preferred by Democrats in the last eight months, but it cannot scrape by for eight weeks until Bidenomics arrives and the spending floodgates reopen.</td>
      <td>Regarding Alan Blinder’s “A Speedy Recovery Depends on More Aid. Will Trump Deliver?” (op-ed, Nov. 27): Prof. Blinder chants the left’s mantra that the economic recovery is in peril unless President Trump and Senate Republicans can work with House Democrats to pass another stimulus package. It’s hard to believe, however, that the economy could survive and thrive during the state lockdowns preferred by Democrats in the last eight months, but it cannot scrape by for eight weeks until Bidenomics arrives and the spending floodgates reopen.<br />If times are so tough in several blue or purple states, why did Democrats in the House reject the GOP offer in October of a $1.8 trillion stimulus package? The governments that allegedly were in decent fiscal health before the pandemic were, in fact, living on the edge after decades of imprudent underfunding of pension and health benefits for government workers.<br />Some type of federal bailout of beleaguered state and local governments surely is on the horizon. It is a rare politician in either party who doesn’t love bringing home the pork, and the 2022 election campaigning will unofficially kick off shortly after Inauguration Day. Democrats’ pleas for more money now may reflect a desire to get a couple more trillion dollars of pre-Biden spending out of the way (and blamed on president President Trump), so that there is a clean slate for a real spending surge when Joe Biden is in the White House. As it is, the national economy is strong, holiday spending appears to be robust, states that are strapped can muddle through and Sen. Mitch McConnell should live up to his reputation and just say no.<br />Mark Adams<br />Atlanta</td>

      <td>After suffering losses in congressional races across the country, some Democrats are pushing the party to re-evaluate its focus on health care and prioritize the economy ahead of two key Senate races in Georgia.<br />Health care was the most-mentioned issue across all Democratic presidential and Senate television ads, airing nearly 1.5 million times, in the 2020 election cycle, according to data from political ad tracker Kantar/CMAG. Democrats made defending the Affordable Care Act a top issue in Supreme Court confirmation hearings weeks before the election and promised repeatedly on the campaign trail to protect the law.<br />Democrats took the House majority in 2018 after centering their campaigns on the Trump administration’s efforts to chip away at the health law. But after the party lost multiple House seats and underperformed in several Senate races this year, some former candidates and strategists who worked on 2020 campaigns say Democrats should have focused more on people who were losing their jobs and struggling to pay rent during the pandemic.<br />“I think that the message needs to shift more towards the economy,” said Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who lost her race in November in a Miami-Dade County district that swung toward President Trump after voting overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in 2016.<br />“There’s a lot of fear that many people here will not be able to get back to work, that they don’t know where they’re going to be able to find their next paycheck,” she said.</td>

IAC, under Chairman Barry Diller, is pushing back, saying such a move would devastate a key part of its business.<br />The  Alphabet Inc.  unit so far hasn’t acted on the internal recommendation of its Chrome trust and safety team regarding IAC in part because the two are rivals in some categories and because the search giant’s executives, including Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker, are concerned that penalties could be viewed as anticompetitive, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Google was sued in October by federal prosecutors for allegedly operating an antitrust monopoly in search.

      <td>From free video calling to a $2,495 stationary bike, here’s a look at how companies used pricing to respond to the coronavirus crisis</td>
      <td>Free Zoom, $13 unlimited  Walmart  delivery, a $30  Disney  movie, a $399 iPhone and a $2,495 Peloton bike: This year, companies in tech and other industries used the lever of pricing in ways that managed the pandemic’s obstacles or even capitalized on its opportunities.<br />Ordinarily, an economic downturn causes a decrease in demand for many products and services. Yet the Covid-19 pandemic’s widely varying impact on different corners of the economy tested traditional pricing approaches. Companies played up conveniences, knocked down barriers and offered new services and new choices—with mixed results. Here’s a look at examples of intriguing price moves this year:<br />“Mulan,” a $200 million live-action remake years in the works, was supposed to have a big theatrical release—but the coronavirus had other plans. Instead,  Walt Disney Co.  charged $30 for at-home “premier access” to the title, for people already paying $6.99 a month for a Disney+ subscription. After three months, “Mulan” became available on the service for no extra charge.<br />In the film industry, it’s common to charge a higher price for early viewing, reducing the price as time goes on. For some, the “Mulan” price was a bargain. Between popcorn, drinks and tickets, a family outing to the theaters easily exceeds that. For others, $30 was too high.<br />During its opening weekend, “Mulan” appeared as No. 10 on Nielsen’s U.S. streaming charts, with 525 million minutes streamed. The list was otherwise dominated by  Netflix Inc.  and topped by the streaming giant’s “Cobra Kai” series, which drew an estimated 2.2 billion streaming minutes.</td>

Critics called it a gamble with human lives, especially those of the most vulnerable. With its shift in strategy, the government is now siding with those advocating at least some mandatory restrictions.</td>

      <td>Republican hopefuls will need to lay the groundwork for potential campaigns of their own without alienating the president and his supporters</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Trump’s public and private musings about running again in 2024 are scrambling the calculus for the large field of fellow Republicans considering bids.<br />Most hopefuls have been quick to show deference. But it’s unclear whether Mr. Trump, who refuses to concede his loss to President-elect Joe Biden, will follow through, and rivals either way will likely seek ways to remain viable. Prospective GOP candidates don’t want to risk alienating Mr. Trump’s base by appearing to push him aside, but they also don’t want to be left unprepared if he decides not to run.<br />“For the last 20 years everyone who has run for president has always started off pretending like they weren’t. You can still do that with the possibility of Trump running again,” said Republican strategist Todd Harris. The 2024 election, he added, “could be the first time loyalty to Trump and political ambition are put on a collision course.”<br />Mr. Trump—who managed to get more than 74 million votes in his losing effort this year—demonstrated his grip on the party base with Saturday’s rally in Georgia for two senators locked in tight runoff elections. “Four more years, four more years,” a shoulder-to-shoulder crowd chanted. He is raising millions of dollars for a newly formed political committee that can fund future campaign activity.<br />“Trump blocks out the sun on all of the other prospective candidates,” said Kevin Madden, a former adviser to Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and now a senator from Utah. “You show up in New Hampshire and talk about the future of the GOP, you immediately put a target on your back with Trump and his followers. Are you willing to take that fight on?”</td>

Soon, it could have just one.<br />Covid-19 is accelerating a rash of global refinery shutdowns in the world’s richest economies. Companies from energy giant  Royal Dutch Shell  PLC to Australian fuel company  Ampol Ltd.  are closing facilities or considering doing so as they reckon with anemic fuel demand and growing competition from newer, more efficient fuel-making facilities in Asia and the Middle East.<br />Eleven refineries from the U.S. to Japan have said this year that they intended to close. Three have announced partial shutdowns, and at least another five are on the chopping block, according to analytics firm  IHS Markit .<br />The thinning out is part of a global shift in fuel-making power away from wealthier countries, where demand is in long-term decline and there are many older, smaller refineries. Newer, larger facilities in countries such as China generally are able to produce fuels for less, benefitting from growing regional markets and shipping their products overseas.<br />More than 1.7 million barrels a day worth of refining capacity in countries such as the U.S. and Japan has disappeared or is poised to do so in 2020 and 2021, as China, India and the Middle East add more than 2.2 million barrels a day worth of fuel-making capability, according to the International Energy Agency.</td>

      <td>Shares have won big this year, not primarily because earnings went up but because the cost of money went down almost to zero</td>
      <td>Many investors are still bewildered that the shock of 2020’s economy gave rise to the awe that is this year’s stock market. The puzzle gets worse: Stocks have done better than their norm of the past century even if you invested at the high in 2007 and held through both the worst financial crisis and worst pandemic in 100 years. What on Earth is going on?<br />The answer should give pause to investors who plan to hold for the long run. Stocks have won big, not primarily because earnings went up but because the cost of money went down almost to zero. A repeat in the next decade is almost inconceivable, which means future returns are likely to be pedestrian, at best.<br />To put some numbers on it, an investor who bought the S&P 500 in October 2007, stayed calm as Lehman Brothers went bust, and ignored the repeated panics and the pandemic made an annualized 7.3% above inflation, including dividends. That is far better than the 6.5% annualized real return on U.S. stocks from 1900 to the start of this year calculated by academics Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton for  Credit Suisse .  It is on a par with the postwar returns of 7.4% over inflation annually from 1950 to the start of the year, despite the great financial crisis and the pandemic, the worst hits to the economy since the second world war.<br />This year is a fine example of why: In 2020, falling earnings coincided with much higher valuations of future earnings, as lower interest rates and bond yields made stocks look more attractive.<br />Unpack that thought and the implication is that we are paying more for the same future stream of income. That is, stocks offer pretty much the same prospective profits and dividends that they did before, but at a higher price. Sure, some biotechnology and videoconferencing stocks have had their growth accelerated by the pandemic, but shareholders of airlines, shopping-mall owners and travel companies will be using a big chunk of future profits to pay for the debt needed to survive 2020. The market assumption is that 2020 is a write-off but that S&P earnings in 2021 will be about 4% above last year’s, and 2022’s will reach roughly where 2021’s were expected to be before the pandemic hit.</td>

They used that experience to expand from the purchase of a single derelict site nearby into one of the world’s largest independent gas-station operators, with over 6,000 sites across Europe, and more recently in Australia and the U.S.<br />They took advantage as big oil companies sold off underperforming gas stations, snapping up sites in the U.K. and then in Europe. Their playbook: doubling down on higher-margin food, selling fresh and packaged groceries and franchising some of the world’s most recognizable fast-food brands.<br />Now the Issa brothers are looking to repeat the trick in the U.S. EG Group—the business they own along with private-equity firm TDR Capital—struck its sixth American acquisition in just over two years in November.<br />But as the brothers explore a stock-market listing for the business, they are facing scrutiny over corporate governance and the debt amassed to fund the rapid expansion.

Chinese authorities last month stopped Ant from raising more than $34 billion in record-breaking initial public offerings in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and are planning to implement rules that would sharply curb the company’s growth ambitions.<br />Back in 2018, the Hangzhou-based startup approached banks with a proposition that many lenders found hard to resist. Ant offered to match them with users of Alipay, its ubiquitous payments app used by hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens and many of the country’s small businesses.<br />The banks were asked to supply funds for short-term online loans and Ant would connect them with borrowers, provide them with some credit-risk metrics, and channel payments back to the lenders. In return, Ant collected fees for helping to originate the loans, while banks earned interest income on the debt.<br />Around 100 banks, ranging from national lenders to small rural banks, signed up for the opportunity to expand their balance sheets by partnering with Ant. At the end of June, Chinese banks and trust companies had the equivalent of around $230 billion in outstanding loans to consumers who borrowed through Alipay, according to calculations by The Wall Street Journal based on Ant’s disclosures.</td>

      <td>TOKYO—Japan’s space agency on Sunday successfully retrieved a capsule of asteroid dust dropped off by the space probe Hayabusa 2, with hopes it will carry hints about how life started on Earth.<br />The retrieval in the Australian outback was the latest feat in a competition among the world’s major scientific powers, including the U.S. and China, to bring back samples from extraterrestrial bodies. Alongside scientific research, one goal is to figure out what kind of places might be suitable someday for mineral extraction.<br />On Dec. 1, China said it landed a probe on the moon in humanity’s first bid since the 1970s to return lunar rocks to the Earth. The U.S. has its own asteroid mission that recently grabbed as much as 2 pounds of material from the asteroid Bennu, with return to Earth scheduled in 2023.<br />Japan’s Hayabusa 2 probe blasted off six years ago on its journey to Ryugu, a boxy miniplanet about a half-mile across that circles the sun mostly between the orbits of Earth and Mars. Last year, the probe collected two samples from the asteroid, including one from beneath the surface after firing a projectile to create an artificial crater.<br />After a journey of more than 3.2 billion miles, Hayabusa 2 flew by Earth this weekend and released a capsule that Japanese officials hope will contain at least 0.1 gram of asteroid material, the equivalent of a few grains of rice. The capsule sped through Earth’s atmosphere at 7 miles a second before extending a parachute that allowed it to glide down to a landing spot in Australia on Sunday morning local time.</td>

      <td>President Trump called Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Saturday to push for the state legislature to reverse President-elect Joe Biden’s win in the state, according to a person familiar with the call, the latest move in the president’s unprecedented push to overturn his election loss.<br />The call came hours before Mr. Trump was to travel to Georgia for a Saturday evening rally to support incumbent Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in the Jan. 5 runoffs, which will determine which party controls the Senate. Mr. Perdue is facing Democrat Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, and Ms. Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock, a pastor.<br />Republicans are eager for Mr. Trump’s help in driving voter turnout for the two GOP candidates, but some also fear that his efforts to portray the presidential election as “rigged,’’ and his criticism of state Republican leaders for their handling of balloting, will discourage his supporters from voting.<br />In his conversation with Mr. Kemp Saturday, Mr. Trump asked the governor to call a special session of the state legislature and push lawmakers to appoint pro-Trump electors who would swing the Electoral College in his favor, the person familiar with the call said. While federal law allows state legislatures to intervene in the process of appointing electors in the event the voting process fails on Election Day, no evidence of widespread election fraud has emerged in Georgia.<br />Mr. Kemp, a Republican, declined the president’s request, the person said. The Washington Post earlier reported details of the request. Mr. Kemp doesn’t plan to attend the rally.</td>

They said they have treated a total of 10 patients to date with sickle-cell disease or beta thalassemia with the Crispr therapy.</td>

      <td>The words we use to praise and insult dishes have changed dramatically over time.</td>
      <td>Not so long ago, if you had invited someone over for a meal of something charred, they would have assumed that you were apologizing for burning dinner. Yet now, “charred” is desirable. It signifies food that is robust, deeply flavored and cooked in a modern way, whether on a hot skillet or grill or roasted in an oven.<br />Browsing cookbooks the other day, I noticed that many of the words we now use to praise dishes once would have been considered insults. I found recipes that call for ingredients to be “crushed,” “smashed,” “fermented,” “vinegared” and “sour,” as well as “burned” or “charred.” There was charred corn, charred broccoli, hot charred cherry tomatoes with cold yogurt, every kind of charred meat, charred tofu and even charred butter with lemons.<br />Tastes change from one generation to the next, and this is as true of food words as it is of foods themselves. Such shifts in vocabulary reflect wider social trends. The vogue for charred vegetables and fermented everything goes along with new concerns about health, as well as more globalized attitudes to cooking. We have shaken off the tired old belief that French is the only language in the kitchen. The Mexican “sofrito” and the Indian “tadka” have taken their rightful place alongside the French “mirepoix”—all of them referring to a preparation of finely chopped, flavorsome vegetables.<br />Back in the 1990s, American grocery stores would place a premium on foods that were “imported,” meaning foreign and therefore glamorous. Now it is the “local,” the “sustainable” and the “seed-to-table” that are prized. Cooks of earlier generations might have seen a smashed carrot salad as a failed carrot purée, but we now see such rough-hewn dishes as healthy and natural.<br />Often our attachment to food words is a proxy for craving certain flavors and textures. I am old enough to remember a time when the greatest compliment you could pay a cake was to say it was “light as a feather.” In Gloria Pitzer’s “Better Cookery Book” from 1983, a Yellow Colonial Cake is described as “Perfect, yellow, light-as-a-feather layer cake.” But today’s baking books are just as likely to praise a cake for being “dense,” particularly if it is a chocolate loaf cake.</td>

      <td>An unexpected side-effect of lockdowns: It can be easier to get a meeting with a venture capitalist. For minority founders in tech, that’s made a big difference as Silicon Valley reckons with race issues.</td>
      <td>The world of venture capital is notoriously insular. For tech startups hoping to attract millions of dollars from private investors, having the right connections is often key to getting a meeting—and persuading investors to take a chance on an unproven idea. The result: getting seed funding has always been harder for Silicon Valley outsiders, including startups from outside New York City and the Bay Area, and founders from minority backgrounds. The numbers are particularly stark for Black founders: Between 2013 and 2017, 77% of founders of active U.S. startups that had received venture capital were white. Only 1% were Black.<br />But something unexpected is happening during this chaotic year: Owing to a convergence of factors, some Black founders of tech startups are finding that it’s easier to attract investment.<br />For starters, pandemic lockdowns have made investors easier to reach. Many are now more accessible through Zoom and social media. This has eliminated not just physical barriers but also psychological barriers to funding companies outside of startup hubs like New York City and the Bay Area.<br />Black founders also say that the killing of George Floyd, subsequent protests and the broader cultural movement that has ensued have caused the VC industry to reckon with its track record of funding minority founders. Many companies and investors—including SoftBank, Google, PayPal, and Andreessen Horowitz—have announced diversity-focused funds and started cutting checks from them.<br />“Never did we think 2020 would be a tipping point for ShearShare,” says Courtney Caldwell, co-founder of the company sometimes known as “Hairbnb,” which uses a marketplace approach to match hairstylists with salon owners.</td>

      <td>MEXICO CITY—The October arrest in the U.S. of Mexico’s former defense minister sparked anger among senior Mexican military officers, a key factor that led President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to push hard for the release of the influential general.<br />Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos, who served as defense minister from 2012 to 2018, was arrested for allegedly taking bribes to protect the operations of a drug cartel. The surprise arrest in Los Angeles, as the general and his wife were starting a California vacation, stirred an outcry among high-ranking Mexican officers.<br />The military is a key ally of the Mexican president, one he can ill afford to alienate. Top officers were angered that Gen. Cienfuegos had been arrested by U.S. authorities outside Mexico and would be judged in the U.S., two senior Mexican government officials said. Officers saw this as a humiliation and a violation of Mexico’s sovereignty. Others also believed the general was innocent.<br />The arrest awakened nationalist anti-American passions in the armed forces, said former Foreign Minister Jorge Castañeda.<br />“This is a hard blow to Mexico’s image and for its armed forces,” an active-duty general wrote to Mr. Castañeda in a WhatsApp message, according to Mr. Castañeda. “Cienfuegos is innocent,” the active-duty general added. “This is a totally abusive and arbitrary action by the U.S. I consider it an insult to Mexico.”</td>

Khaldoon al-Mubarak wanted to know how bad things could get.<br />Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son assured the chief executive of Mubadala Investment Co. that a fund housing $15 billion of Mubadala’s money was diverse enough to withstand the storm. BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink explained to Mr. Mubarak how government stimulus could boost the U.S. economy. Egon Durban, co-CEO of private-equity firm Silver Lake, argued the market had become too bearish and was overlooking an eventual vaccine.<br />“In those early days I was on the phone all the time,” said the 44-year-old Mr. Mubarak, a Tufts University graduate who sports a crew cut and is as comfortable in a suit as a traditional Emirati thobe. “For me, it was instrumental in really forming a view.”<br />The view that emerged was that the world would eventually bounce back from the pandemic and that an unprecedented crisis would bring big opportunities. Mr. Mubarak staked billions on that belief, committing to new investment partnerships with U.S. private-equity giants  Apollo Global Management Inc.  and Silver Lake while making new bets on everything from  Alphabet Inc.’s  self-driving car effort to a firm working on a coronavirus vaccine trial.<br />He made this push while many of his peers pulled back. Mubadala  invested more than $11 billion this year as of December 1, according to consulting firm Global SWF, up 46% from the entirety of last year. That compares with a 36% decline in new capital deployed by all sovereign funds over the same period. A larger United Arab Emirates fund, the $500 billion Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, is among those that invested less, according to Global SWF. ADIA declined to comment.</td>

One day in 2015, I was in the shower and the word Ferrari came to me. I thought, “That’s weird.” Day after day for a week, I would get in the shower and the word Ferrari would come to me. Finally, I went to the dealership in Mill Valley, Calif. I went through all the cars and when I saw the 458, I said, “I want to test-drive that one.” They said, “OK, come back tomorrow and we’ll have one you can drive.”<br />The next day one of the guys there pulled this car out and we went up a hill. He hit the gas. In the passenger seat, I felt the G-force and it was one of the most thrilling things I ever felt in my life. When I got behind the wheel, I punched the gas, and it was even more thrilling. That was it: I had to have this car.<br /><br />Ordering a new Ferrari is not like ordering other cars. I spent two weeks going back and forth, designing it. At first I wanted it all chocolate color, exterior and interior. They talked me out of it. I ended up selecting titanium paint, a chocolate-colored suede interior, and a black dashboard that would not distract from the driving experience. I put carbon fiber everywhere I could. I chose yellow brake calipers, which matched the yellow in the Ferrari logo. (It is the traditional color of founder Enzo Ferrari’s hometown—Modena, Italy.) All these decisions and more made my car unique—one of one, built that year.</td>

The widely used financial tool—which has been a source of support for the record-setting stock market—has been attacked by some academics and progressive politicians. Now, those politicians will be in a better position to do something about it.<br />Buybacks have been a particularly hot issue since 2018 when, under terms of the Trump administration’s corporate tax cuts, big U.S. companies repatriated billions of dollars that had been stashed for years in overseas tax havens. In the resulting binge, the dollar value of big companies’ repurchases of their own stock shot up 55% to a record $806 billion. Buyback foes complained that such repurchases enriched shareholders, generally wealthier Americans, at the expense of workers, new plants and research, and broader economic development<br />Buybacks are down about 30% this year, as companies conserve cash to ride out the pandemic. But the issue remains prominent for Democrats who just took the White House and retained the House as they plan their legislative and regulatory agenda.<br />With that in mind, here is what investors need to know about buybacks—and why they are controversial.</td>

      <td>Consumer-product makers are under pressure to pitch in as customers and lawmakers pay more attention to plastic waste</td>
      <td>Who should pay to recycle discarded cereal boxes, drinks bottles and detergent containers?<br />The makers of such products have long fought efforts to make them pay for the cost of dealing with packaging waste. Now, trade groups that represent companies like  Procter & Gamble Co.  and  PepsiCo Inc.  are softening that stance, as consumers become more concerned about plastic waste and municipalities struggle to cover the costs of their recycling programs.<br />Federal and state lawmakers in the U.S. are proposing bills to push companies to pick up the tab for managing empty soda bottles, candy wrappers, cereal boxes and other packaging they use. Such rules could help pay for curbside collection and sorting infrastructure, and spur companies to design packaging that is easier to recycle, lawmakers say.<br />Charging companies “puts the financial burden of plastic pollution back on the manufacturers who generate it and profit from it,” said Sen. Tom Udall (D., N.M.), who this year introduced a bill that would make companies pay to collect and process waste. Several states including Massachusetts, New York and Washington are considering similar measures.<br />Packaging has become more complex of late, often being a mix of materials such as aluminum layered with different plastics to make baby and pet-food pouches. Most recycling facilities can’t handle these. Also, a 2018 ban on waste imports by China, historically the biggest buyer of used plastic from the U.S., created a glut of recyclables with nowhere to go. Ninety two recycling programs have been eliminated in the U.S. since late 2017, according to the Recycling Partnership, a nonprofit.</td>

      <td>Whether it’s for a backyard ‘minimony’ or a public-park ‘micro-wedding,’ ‘corona brides’ are getting creative with jumpsuits, short dresses and other options that Grandma would hate</td>
      <td>IN MY FAMILY, we classify life’s challenges into two tiers: problems and “prombles.” A problem is a broken bone; a “promble” is a broken pencil. In the omnishambles of the coronavirus pandemic, being forced to reimagine one’s wedding is a mere ‘promble.’ But that doesn’t make it feel any less gutting to the many couples worldwide who have either postponed or drastically scaled back their nuptials this year. Elaborate country-club weddings and tropical destination events were downsized to “minimonies” (tiny weddings), “micromonies” (another word for tiny weddings) and intimate backyard affairs. Grandma stayed home. Banquets became slices of pizza. And over-the-top poofy dresses chosen by committee became jumpsuits and minidresses purchased online, worn with white face masks.<br />By the time I was enlisted to officiate my friend Alice Newell-Hanson’s New York City wedding in September, it had gone from being a 180-person warehouse rager to a four-person affair under a tree among the pigeons and hookah-puffers of Washington Square Park. The bride’s original dress—a floor-length embroidered gown fit for a very chic Renaissance Faire—was replaced by a shorter white Proenza Schouler dress with a leather buttoned belt. In the same amount of time it took me to become a reverend of the American Marriage Ministries (five minutes), the bride bought her new dress online. “Knowing we weren’t going to have tons of family there gave me a new sense of freedom. The dress didn’t have to be something that my relatives would ‘get,’” Alice said, adding that her family back in England was particularly mystified by the belt. She has no regrets: “I think I’m going to like what I wore better in the long run because it really just felt like me.”<br />Many “corona brides” (as they call themselves on social media) I spoke to expressed a similar silver-lining sentiment. Few mourn the extravagant confections designed to make an entrance on a curving staircase. Perhaps the minimal, less exorbitant gown is a cooler, more contemporary look anyway. Just look at Lily Allen, the British singer who wed this fall on a small scale in Las Vegas. Her short, tailored Dior dress looked just right—even iconic—for her wedding pictures at the burger joint In N’ Out.<br />Dyanna Villaluna Volek, 36, a government affairs manager for the San Francisco International Airport, had planned a 150-person gala at the airport’s museum for this November. While she originally bought multiple “very traditional” vintage options to choose from to fit the event’s 1920s theme, she ended up renting a simpler gown from Rent the Runway to wear with an unorthodox  Etsy  cape for her revised tiny public-park ceremony. When the nuptials had come and gone, she went to a  FedEx  shop to return the dress and remembers thinking, “Shouldn’t I feel more connected to my wedding dress?” But she realized, “I think that was like the whole ceremony in and of itself, we mourned what was supposed to be for a little bit and then we let it go and then something better came along.”<br />Should you choose to buy rather than rent a gown, one advantage of going for a simpler design is that it can be worn again. Vanessa Cocchiaro, a Paris-based Australian designer with a thriving bridal business, makes wearable pieces like jumpsuits and slip dresses, most of which sell for under $1,000. While she’s watched friends who design couture-level clothing close their businesses, she said her affordable and modern dresses are flying out the door, purchased for intimate Covid-era ceremonies. An Australian client of Ms. Cocchiaro’s was originally going to wear “a princess dress” but when she reconceived her wedding as a humbler affair, opted instead for one of Ms. Cocchiaro’s short frocks. The designer explained, “She said she still felt bridal-ish but beautiful and it’s something that she’s going to wear again and again.”</td>

They are fundamentally different from other objects of bygone days. Whereas, say, silent pictures from Denmark or Japan document the past, there remains an unbroken link between such movies and new ones produced in those countries today. Not so for Yiddish films, which are truly relics from a vanished world. Equally significant, Yiddish movies are distinguished by their extra-nationality. They were produced not in a single country, but rather on two continents an ocean apart, primarily in the U.S. and Poland.<br />The American debut of a collection of recently restored Yiddish films offers a precious peek into what has largely been a void for most of us. “The Jewish Soul” contains 10 pictures on five Blu-rays and marks another significant collaboration between the Paris-based Lobster Films, which managed the difficult reconstructions and initially released them in France, and Kino Lorber, which added bonus materials and is distributing the package stateside. (The set is also available for purchase, and several titles can be rented, digitally via the Kino Now platform at kinonow.com.)<br />Yiddish cinema’s great tragedy was its short life. It didn’t really take off until the mid-1930s, and the form was virtually extinguished by the Holocaust, though filming in America limped along till roughly 1950. There had been silent films—“The Golem” (1915), from Germany, is perhaps the best example—that dealt with Jewish themes and characters, but the absence of spoken dialogue left them bereft of a vital aspect: the sound of Yiddish itself, the innately musical, profoundly emotional and irrepressibly funny language of Ashkenazi Jewry.</td>

      <td>An exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art shows how artists used the most elemental of creative practices—drawing—to reinvent their world.</td>
      <td>New York<br />Because drawing is more modest in scale and intimate in its mode of address than many of the other forms of contemporary art being shown today, it is easy to overlook or take for granted. Kudos to the Museum of Modern Art, then, for thrusting it into the conversation with “Degree Zero: Drawing at Midcentury.” The show covers the years 1948-61, when in the aftermath of World War II artists felt art itself had to be reinvented from the ground up and chose that most fundamental of processes, drawing, for the task. At every turn “Degree Zero” upends our expectations to tell us something new about what was going on at that time.<br />The approximately 80 works here were all drawn from MoMA’s collection by Associate Curator Samantha Friedman, the show’s organizer, and have been installed with sufficient space between them to permit safe viewing at close quarters. They were made by artists from Latin America, Asia and Africa in addition to Europe and North America, until recently the museum’s almost exclusive focus. So along with MoMA pantheon members like Henri Matisse and Jackson Pollock, we encounter the likes of Jean Dubuffet, Willys de Castro, Otto Piene and Yayoi Kusama, as well as names likely to be as new to the general public as they were to me. This broad-gauge approach is nothing less than revelatory, forcing us to think differently about certain exalted reputations as a result.<br />The show’s theme is poignantly captured in an untitled charcoal and chalk drawing by the French abstractionist Hans Hartung from 1960. It consists of closely abutting dark, black vertical marks of almost uniform length. On the one hand it reads as a kind of existentialist manifesto, “I draw, therefore I am.” Yet at the same time, the individual parts seem to be in the process of resolving themselves into an image—art coming into being before our eyes.<br />Among the unforgettable discoveries is Sonja Sekula (1918-1963), who divided her time between the U.S. and her native Switzerland, where, the label tells us, she underwent treatment for mental illness. “The Voyage” (1956) is a jewel-like, ink-and-watercolor work organized into a loose grid. Each of its panels is a different color and obsessively filled with a dense web of lines and minuscule circles within which the only recognizable image is that of a ship. It is a mesmerizing, vertiginous record of the journey through a charged interior landscape that demands—and rewards—prolonged, close scrutiny. A pity, then, that it’s hung almost too high to be seen properly.</td>

      <td>TOKYO—An enduring mystery of the Covid-19 pandemic is why East Asian countries across the board have experienced far fewer cases and deaths than the U.S. and Europe.<br />Some doctors and scientists are beginning to take a closer look at theories that some people in East Asia and Southeast Asia have had different exposure to previous coronaviruses resembling the SARS-CoV-2 virus sweeping the globe. Such exposure could have protected them from getting sick from Covid-19 or lessened the severity of the disease.<br />Others doubt that the immune systems of people in the region differ from people in the rest of the world in any systematic way. They suspect cultural factors and, in some countries, government policies such as tightly enforced quarantines are playing the main role.<br />Whatever the case, doctors agree that some explanation is needed for why Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore all have experienced at most a few thousand new SARS-CoV-2 infections a day, even during the current surge. That compares with tens of thousands of daily cases in many European nations and more than 150,000 new cases on many days in the U.S.<br />Yasuhiro Suzuki has pondered the question as the highest-ranking doctor in the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare’s medical corps until his retirement in August.</td>

Sanford said it decided to call off the proposed pairing with the appointment last week of its new CEO, Bill Gassen.<br />“With this leadership change, it’s an important time to refocus our efforts internally as we assess the future direction of our organization,” Mr. Gassen said.<br />Mr. Krabbenhoft had planned to serve as president emeritus of the combined hospital system after the merger. The former CEO’s final weeks at Sanford were tumultuous, following an email he sent to staff in which he said he wouldn’t wear a mask after recovering from Covid-19.

The Friday ruling also asks the government to issue two-year permits for it.<br />“Today’s decision from a federal judge in New York is a victory for the courageous directly impacted plaintiffs, all DACA recipients and DACA-eligible youth,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, state and local policy manager for United We Dream and herself a DACA recipient.<br />The DACA program was created by the Obama administration in 2012 to offer work permits and deportation protections to young immigrants, known as Dreamers, who have been living in the country without legal permission since childhood. To apply, an immigrant must have arrived in the U.S. before age 16, lived in the country since 2007 and have a high-school diploma or a GED.</td>

A court filing in federal district court in Washington unsealed earlier this week indicated that communications involving Mr. Lowell were at issue in an investigation of an alleged “secret lobbying scheme” and potential bribery in exchange for the pardon.<br />The court filing was heavily redacted but the roles of Mr. Lowell and Mr. Diller were confirmed this week by people familiar with the case and documents reviewed by the Journal. Their identities were earlier reported by the New York Times.<br />The Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section was investigating the case, according to people familiar with the investigation, and its status is unknown. The Justice Department declined to comment. “It is my understanding that the Justice Department had and has absolutely no quarrel with anything that Abbe did in this matter,” an attorney for Mr. Lowell, Reid Weingarten, said, adding: “There was no bribe, there was no clemency, this is what the prosecutors concluded and this entire matter is much ado about nothing.”</td>

(Unlike most recording artists of his stature, Mr. Bennett isn’t signed to a record label.) Five years ago, for example, the two longtime friends—Mr. Corcoran is about three years older—had only a 15-person team handling tasks like marketing and selling merchandise.<br />News of a rift between Chance the Rapper and his manager comes during the rockiest period of the artist’s career to date.</td>

      <td>Federal program allowing states to make Medicaid recipients work has been blocked by lower courts</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court said Friday it would consider the legality of a Trump administration program allowing states to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients.<br />Lower courts have blocked the program, which stripped health insurance from recipients who didn’t file paperwork demonstrating they were working or otherwise complying with or exempt from the requirements. Those courts found that the requirements interfered with Medicaid’s statutory purpose of  expanding health-care coverage for lower-income Americans.<br />In its Supreme Court appeal, the Trump administration argues that the secretary of Health and Human Services has broad discretion to authorize experimental projects to test policies that could further Medicaid’s purpose. The administration argues that promoting recipients’ economic self-sufficiency could improve “health outcomes”—for example, by “‘incentiviz[ing] beneficiaries to engage in their own health care”—and therefore is in line with the goals Congress established for Medicaid.<br />The case the high court agreed to hear centers on Arkansas, which in March 2018 was granted a waiver allowing it to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients through Dec. 31, 2021.<br />The waiver, which authorized a program called Arkansas Works, was in effect for 10 months before being blocked by a federal court.  “More than 18,000 people (about 25% of those subject to the work requirement) lost coverage as a result of the project in just five months,” a federal appeals court noted.</td>

The private economy did even better with 344,000 new jobs, offset by a decline in government payrolls—mainly due to the end of 93,000 temporary census jobs. State and local governments lost a net of 13,000, nearly all of that related to local school closures.<br />Much of the economy is still recovering well from the pandemic recession, as manufacturing and construction both added 27,000 jobs in the month. Transportation and warehousing had a gangbusters month with 145,000 new hires, as  Amazon  continues to hire as many as 1,400 workers a day.  Walmart  has added tens of thousands of new U.S. workers since March, as its online sales have soared, and this week it announced more than $700 million in new cash bonuses for employees. The retailer has paid $2.8 billion in employee bonuses this year.<br />The struggling parts of the economy are smaller retailers, small businesses and consumer services hit by greater social distancing amid the sharp spike in Covid infections. Hiring for the holiday season was below normal. Restaurants and bars, which had been recovering, shed 17,400 jobs in the month.</td>

      <td>Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf says he feels the pain of businesses struggling to survive the pandemic, but does he really? On Monday he vetoed a bill providing liability protections for schools, businesses and other employers against Covid-related lawsuits.<br />Mr. Wolf in May issued an executive order protecting health-care workers and owners of real estate that was donated for Covid emergency services. His order doesn’t protect businesses from lawsuits by customers who catch Covid. The bill passed by the GOP Legislature did.<br />Nearly 80 associations representing schools, child-care providers, small businesses and others backed the bill. “For the foreseeable future,” they wrote in a letter to Mr. Wolf, “employers will be subject to strict workplace health and safety requirements and those who adopt these precautions should proceed with confidence knowing they will not be targeted with frivolous, and potentially devastating, litigation.”<br />The legislation wouldn’t absolve businesses that disregard public-health requirements. But its higher standards for lawsuits, requiring clear and convincing evidence of gross negligence, could head off many frivolous suits. More than a dozen states including Michigan and Idaho have enacted similar legislation. Mr. Wolf said the legislation was too broad and unnecessary, but businesses with their livelihoods on the line disagree.<br />His veto is especially worrisome given the state’s plaintiff-friendly legal climate. Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court and Philadelphia’s Court of Common Pleas top the American Tort Reform Association’s list of “Judicial Hellholes” this year. The report notes that Pennsylvania has one of the nation’s highest payout rates in medical liability suits, and Philadelphia is a top jurisdiction for asbestos litigation.</td>

      <td>Donald Trump’s campaign against the 2020 Presidential outcome undermines political legitimacy, but no side is blameless in America’s partisan election escalation. Witness the new Democratic effort to overturn the election result in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District—which could be emulated in New York’s 22nd if Republicans win there too.<br />Iowa’s state elections board on Monday certified Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks’s victory in the 2nd district, flipping a seat currently held by a Democrat. But her opponent, Rita Hart, is dusting off a 1969 federal statute to have the House of Representatives pick the winner. That means Democrats in Washington could overrule Iowa voters to seat a co-partisan and grow their majority.<br />The Iowa race was decided by six votes. The counting went on for weeks as 24 counties canvassed and recanvassed over 390,000 ballots, and lawyers from both sides haggled with election officials over machine counting, ballot qualifications and voter intent.<br />Normally this exhaustive process would end matters. Not this year. Ms. Hart’s campaign said it will bypass an Iowa court appeal and ask the Committee on House Administration to intervene. The House has final say on its Members’ elections and the Supreme Court has held that courts can’t intervene in those decisions under the Constitution’s Article I.<br />That means the count in Iowa’s 2nd District will become a political fight rather than a legal one. House Democrats in 1985 took advantage of the same process to reverse Indiana’s state certification of a Republican winner in a Congressional race. They refused to seat either candidate in January, and in May declared the Democrat the winner after their recount excluded 32 absentee votes.</td>

      <td>The videogame publishing company said Netflix illegally recruited Spencer Neumann in late 2018, prompting a contract breach</td>
      <td>Activision Blizzard Inc.  is suing  Netflix Inc.  for allegedly poaching its former finance chief and causing competitive harm, citing a pattern of behavior by the streaming giant.<br />In a complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Friday, the videogame publishing company said Netflix illegally recruited Spencer Neumann in late 2018, prompting a contract breach that disrupted business operations. Activision said the move also cost it business opportunities as well as millions of dollars paid out to retain other executives.<br />Mr. Neumann, who previously held roles at the  Walt Disney Co.  and private-equity firms, joined Activision as its finance chief in May 2017. The employment contract initially carried a three-year term.<br />“Netflix has a demonstrated pattern of caring only about attracting and employing whoever Netflix wants, regardless of whether it violates the law along the way,” the suit claims.<br />A spokesman for Netflix declined to comment on the lawsuit.</td>

      <td>Relocation of 700 troops from Somalia reverses administration course; move follows troop cuts in Iraq, Afghanistan</td>
      <td>President Trump ordered the Pentagon to pull nearly all U.S. troops out of Somalia, where for 13 years they have been fighting a low-intensity battle against the local al Qaeda affiliate, al-Shabaab, U.S. officials said.<br />The roughly 700 troops stationed in Somalia would move to bases in Kenya and Djibouti and enter Somalia to conduct shorter counterterrorism missions against al-Shabaab, as well as a smaller force of Islamic State militants. The U.S. troops are expected to leave the country by early next year, the officials said.<br />The move, supported by the new acting defense secretary, Chris Miller, effectively reverses the course set by his predecessor, Mark Esper. Mr. Esper favored drawing down U.S. forces operating in the volatile Sahel region of West Africa while maintaining the American presence in Somalia, according to a senior U.S. official.<br />The Pentagon, in a statement sent to lawmakers Friday, said that despite the withdrawal, U.S. aims in Somalia hadn’t changed. “We will continue to degrade violent extremist organizations that could threaten our homeland while ensuring we maintain our strategic advantage in great power competition,” the statement said.<br />The Trump administration’s push to reduce U.S. forces in Africa has drawn opposition from lawmakers from both parties who see a need for a continued American engagement in the continent’s conflict zones. Rep. Anthony Brown (D., Md.), vice chairman of the Armed Services Committee, questioned the wisdom ofsuch troop moves during a presidential transition in Washington.</td>

      <td>Two strikingly different ways of seeing the world, ordering society and understanding human destiny.</td>
      <td>Every man and every woman, it seems, knows Gilbert and Sullivan’s quipping lines from “Iolanthe” (1882): “That every boy and every gal / That’s born into the world alive. / Is either a little Liberal / Or else a little Conservative.” When the lines were first sung, the labels matched up with Britain’s political parties, but they obviously have a wider application—each calling to mind, then and now, a cultural outlook, an inclination, a temperament, even a philosophy. Over time, of course, even the firmest definition will shift, making easy summary difficult and historical circumstance—context, that is—crucial to our understanding of what “liberalism” is and how “conservatism” differs from it. These days, we may also ask: What sets the two sides of democratic politics so far apart?<br />Edmund Fawcett, a former editor and correspondent at the Economist, grappled with one end of this polarity in “Liberalism: The Life of an Idea,” published in 2014 and revised four years later. He now explores its opposing force in “Conservatism: The Fight for a Tradition.” A self-described left-wing liberal, Mr. Fawcett believes that both categories of thought (and politics) are facing critical tests, making it all the more urgent that we grasp their genealogy—how they developed and what they have come to represent. He calls his explorations “historical essays,” and indeed they are written in a reflective mode, though at times in an impassioned style. Members of both thought-categories will find much to learn from both books, not least from the historical figures Mr. Fawcett brings into view.<br />Mr. Fawcett notes that, in the broadest terms, the modern era in advanced societies has been governed by a liberal outlook, one in which the liberty or freedom of the individual has been increasingly protected from the state or “liberated” from custom, hierarchy and the institutions—notably, the church—that once dictated social relations and guided man’s understanding of himself. The origins of this outlook, he notes, can be traced to the Enlightenment, when “reason” was elevated to an exalted position and, it was believed, a rational scrutiny of both principles and institutions would lead humanity away from dark superstition and upward toward the light.<br />Enlightenment thinkers, Mr. Fawcett reminds us, encouraged the idea that society might be understood and thereby changed for the better. They also sought to sever moral codes from their traditional mooring, or at least to rethink them: As Mr. Fawcett puts it, David Hume and Immanuel Kant “welcomed liberty from ethical tutelage” so that men could determine their own standards of conduct. The German statesman Wilhelm von Humboldt saw education as a way to realize individual possibility rather than, as tradition would have it, train for an occupation or a social role. Benjamin Constant, in France, focused on the concept of liberty, which he defined as a condition of existence allowing people to turn away interference from either society or the state. Calling absolute power radically illegitimate, François Guizot insisted that human imperfection meant that no person, class, faith or interest should have the final say. Like other French liberals of his day, he sought a juste milieu—a place where interests and ideas could be balanced. Enlightenment philosophers on the Continent also challenged the assumptions of the ancien régime, helping open careers to talent and remove restrictions on office-holding long governed by religion and class.<br />These currents of thought we associate with the 18th century, and for good reason, but after the shock of the American and French revolutions, they were dammed up by the Napoleonic Wars and an interlude of restoration. It was only in the 1830s that the dam broke. A period of rapid change—brought on by the dislocations of the Industrial Revolution, the railway’s remarkable shrinking of distance, and episodes of agricultural depression and financial crisis—demanded a re-assessment of established patterns of thought and governance. Enlightenment-driven liberalism was one mode of response; conservatism, one might say, was a response to the response.</td>

      <td>Children from wealthy families will always have access to high-achieving schools, but for low-income families of all races the exam schools are their best chance for an equally high-level education.</td>
      <td>Regarding Chester E. Finn Jr.’s “A Progressive Assault on Selective High Schools” (op-ed, Nov. 27): Ironically, eliminating the test-based admission process for entry to the country’s elite high schools would hurt the ethnic groups that its proponents are trying to help. Children from wealthy families will always have access to high-achieving schools, but for low-income families of all races the exam schools are their best chance for an equally high-level education. Eliminating the admission tests would destroy the elite schools and eliminate the only chance that poor, especially inner-city students have of receiving an education equal or better than that offered by the private city and wealthy suburban schools.<br />A well-designed exam measures not only what a student has learned but, more importantly, their capacity to learn new things. This is especially important for boys whose maturity level often lags behind their intellectual ability. The elite public schools have turned millions of poor children of all races into today’s leaders.<br />Every child should be academically challenged at a level they can handle. Attending an elite school is only one of many paths to success in life.<br />André Montero<br />Brooklyn Technical High School, ’64</td>

      <td>From his chaotic childhood to a lifetime as consort to the queen, Prince Philip has remained irrepressibly himself.</td>
      <td>As I was growing up, our monarchist British household considered Prince Philip a rather louche character. “It’s all very well for him,” my mother would comment tartly after the latest outrage—a caustic riposte, a scandalous gaffe or a “perfectly dreadful” brown hat worn on some royal tour. “He can say or do whatever he likes, but the queen can’t.”<br />Her comments were unfair. After all, Prince Philip had given up an illustrious career in his beloved Royal Navy to spend the next 70-some years of his life walking two steps behind the queen. A driven, restless and highly energetic man, he was not cut out for a secondary role. Yet as my father, born two months after Philip, was given to say: “You just get on with it.” And the prince consort did. In her biography “Prince Philip Revealed,” Ingrid Seward writes that above all he has been loyal. “For him duty is at the center of everything. It is not a choice.”<br />Royal biographies tend to fall into two categories: reverent, the subject’s imperfections whitewashed; or waspish, a chronicle of backstairs gossip. A clue into which category Ms. Seward’s book falls is provided on the back flap of the book jacket. The editor of a British magazine called Majesty (devoted entirely—surprise—to royals), she appears in a photograph alongside his royal highness, gazing up at him with a worshipful smile.<br />Do we really need yet another book on Prince Philip? What more is there to say about the man? Not a lot. But you can’t believe everything you see in Netflix’s “The Crown.” Ms. Seward’s biography is more than mere hagiography, although it is indeed reverential. And while she takes us painstakingly over well-trodden ground, she does produce some interesting information about Philip’s later years, in particular his relationships with Diana and Meghan Markle.<br />Prince Philip is the most intriguing member of the royal family. His childhood was bizarre. He was born on a dining table in a villa on Corfu, Greece, the youngest in a family of four sisters. His mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was stone deaf (she became a skilled lip reader in four languages). His half-Danish father, Prince Andrew, second in line to the Greek throne, was sentenced to death after the army was defeated in Smyrna by the Turks, saved only by the intervention of George V. In 1930, after eight years of impecunious exile in Paris, the family dispersed. Philip’s sisters married (two of them to high-ranking Nazis); his mother, now mentally ill, was committed to a sanatorium; his father moved to Monte Carlo with his mistress. Philip, at age 9, went away to boarding school. On holidays he was shunted around between relations—a person, he wrote in a guest book, “of no fixed abode.”</td>

He said it was “highly unlikely” that millions of people would gather at the National Mall as part of the festivities.<br />“I think you’re going to see something that is closer to what the convention was like than a typical inauguration,” he said.<br />Mr. Biden said his transition team was holding discussions with congressional leaders in preparations for the events planned on Jan. 20, when he is scheduled to be sworn-in as the nation’s 46th president. Public health officials have continued to warn against large gatherings as coronavirus cases have skyrocketed across the country.<br />“First and foremost, my objective is to keep America safe but still allow people to celebrate,“ Mr. Biden said. ”People want to celebrate. People want to be able to say we’ve passed the baton. We’re moving on and democracy is functioning.”</td>

      <td>The shifts and ambiguities in the novelist’s work resonate with a historian who has chronicled the shadowy forces of persecution.</td>
      <td>At the outset of this brief but haunting work, Saul Friedländer asks himself a question. Now 88, the eminent historian of the Holocaust wonders whether he felt the urge to reread Marcel Proust’s great multivolume novel “In Search of Lost Time” in response “to some need, to something in my personal life that called for delving into that book.” At the close, he will give us an answer. In the meantime, this lifelong student of the worst in human history and character finds relief from a dark vocation in the beauty and irony—and deep ambiguity—of an author he deems “the greatest painter in words in French literature.” This, though, is a shadowed portrait—and the shadows occasionally fall not only over Proust, but his champion as well.<br />Mr. Friedländer has always imbued his scholarship with an acute literary sensibility rooted in a multilingual, border-crossing background. Born in Prague to a nonreligious Jewish family, young Pavel moved to France when the Nazis invaded his Czech homeland. Separated from his parents (who would die in Auschwitz), he survived the war in occupied France as a pupil at a Catholic school but returned to his ancestral faith. Now an ardent Zionist, he left for Israel in 1948. There Pavel/Paul became Saul (reversing the path of his New Testament namesake). He worked for the future Israeli premier and president Shimon Peres, but turned sharply against the divisive nationalism of the Netanyahu era. As a historian, based in Geneva and then at UCLA, he integrated daily life and high policy into his panoramic study of the Third Reich as it descended from persecution to extermination.<br />In addition to the prize-winning volumes of his “Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1933-1945” he has written two luminous memoirs: “When Memory Comes” and “Where Memory Leads.” After a 2013 book on Franz Kafka’s shame and guilt, Mr. Friedländer confirms his late swerve toward literature in the incisive and quizzical essays of “Proustian Uncertainties.” Proust, the conflicted son of a doting Jewish mother and a distant Catholic father, speaks to the historian who mapped the shifting sands of identity in a period when tolerance and assimilation vied with bigotry and harassment.<br />He finds Proust “undecided to the end” about his Jewishness. The nameless narrator of “In Search of Lost Time”—who sometimes shares his creator’s views but often doesn’t—directs both warm sympathy and snobbish mockery toward Jewish characters. He even compares one inoffensive friend to a “hyena,” a spasm of disgust that reveals, for Mr. Friedländer, the “secret self-image” of Proust as a guilty parvenu. Behind this “constant seesaw” lie the bleeding wounds of the Dreyfus Affair, which tore France apart—and divides the novel’s characters—after the Jewish officer was wrongly convicted of treason in 1895.<br />Proust’s homosexuality, which called for perpetual wariness and discretion, also shifted and sharpened his angles of vision. His fiction, Mr. Friedländer shows, mounts an “eloquent defense of homosexuality,” courageous for its date. Still, it can descend into “the language of hatred,” even for the buffoonish but heroic Baron de Charlus—that unforgettable gay Falstaff. Proust shows us a lesbian couple engaged in a symbolic “act of desecration” of a father’s memory, an outrage justified by the narrator as an “escape” from unbearably mixed feelings. Proust’s uncertainties bred Proustian contradictions aplenty.</td>

For decades Turkey worked to build a society open to people of all faiths, and stood against Russian aggression. But a valuable ally has drifted.<br />The U.S. agreed to sell Turkey 100 F-35 jet fighters and include Turkish companies in manufacturing components of the aircraft. But three years ago, Ankara decided to purchase the Russian S-400 missile-defense system, designed to shoot down the F-35. Allowing Russian “advisers” to work near F-35s and giving the S-400 radar proximity to American stealth aircraft is unacceptable.<br />Diplomats, the Pentagon and senators, including us, warned Turkish government officials that there would be consequences. The president should now follow the law and levy sanctions against Turkish entities. The Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act requires sanctions against any country that engages in a “significant transaction” of defense assets with Russia, Iran or North Korea.<br />President Trump has demonstrated his commitment to putting American interests first. And the president has given Turkey every opportunity to cooperate with NATO. Congress, with broad bipartisan support, included enforcement language on Turkey in last year’s national defense authorization.<br />Punishing Turkey for choosing Russia over the U.S. would be a clear warning. Other nations should consider who is a better trade partner: the U.S., with more than 20% of the world’s economy, or Russia, with an economy smaller than the economies of some U.S. states. A failure to follow through would send the message that the U.S. isn’t willing to make hard decisions.</td>

Every year Nova Scotia donates one of its finest firs or spruces to serve as Boston’s official Christmas tree. The gifts come in gratitude for Boston’s help after the 1917 Halifax Explosion—the largest man-made blast of the preatomic age.<br />On the morning of Dec. 6, 1917, the SS Mont-Blanc entered Halifax’s harbor carrying thousands of tons of explosives en route from New York to France for use in World War I. The Norwegian steamship SS Imo, traveling above the speed limit and in the wrong lane, was exiting the harbor. They collided.<br />Unaware of the Mont-Blanc’s cargo, crowds gathered to see the fire. A sailor appraised train dispatcher Vince Coleman of the danger, and rather than flee, Coleman warned incoming trains: “Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbour making for Pier 6 and will explode. Guess this will be my last message. Good-bye boys.” Coleman died at his post; his warning saved as many as 300 lives.<br />The explosion sent up a mushroom cloud 2 miles high and shattered windows 50 miles away. It vaporized water, exposing the harbor floor. Samuel Prince, a survivor, described the devastation in a 1920 dissertation: “Trees were torn from the ground. Poles were snapped like toothpicks. Trains were stopped dead. Cars were left in twisted masses. Pedestrians were thrown violently into the air, houses collapsed on all sides. Streamers were slammed against the docks. Then followed a veritable air-raid, when the sky rained iron fragments upon the helpless city.”<br />Some 2,000 were killed and 9,000 wounded in a city of 50,000.

      <td>Use of face coverings increased impressively right into the current national outbreak.</td>
      <td>It’s to be expected that many who spent four years unproductively obsessing about President Trump now believe his ambivalent mask messaging is responsible for every infection and death in the U.S. The mask issue is not nearly so simple.<br />Mask compliance has actually been pretty good around the U.S. and in Europe regardless of Donald Trump and it didn’t stop the current, worst-yet surge. In frustration, the CDC’s Robert Redfield insisted in midsummer that if everybody wore a mask for several weeks, the virus could be controlled. What he really might have liked to say: “It doesn’t matter how many of us wear masks if the young, who have the least to fear from Covid and are most likely to spread it unwittingly, aren’t wearing them.”<br />Until Nov. 10, his agency truthfully stressed that masks won’t save you from getting the disease, only from transmitting it. Now this guidance has been changed in apparent hope that the noncompliant might respond to a new message that doesn’t lean so heavily on their altruism. And yet a national survey from researchers at Harvard, Rutgers, Northeastern and Northwestern throws cold water on any idea of masks as a simple fix. Mask usage increased impressively across the U.S. right into the current outbreaks even as physical distancing fell by the wayside. “We find that social distancing has decreased dramatically since the spring, while mask wearing has increased,” the group concludes. At worst, our face-covering psychodrama distracted from the behavior that really matters.<br />Whether a Thanksgiving bump will materialize will be known in the next few days. Millions who defied guidance and traveled may have done so safely. France, Spain, Italy and Belgium have seen new infections turn down sharply in the past two weeks. The exception is Germany. Its leaders cite a “prevention paradox”—so successfully was an earlier surge moderated that people stopped fearing the virus. The U.S. may have created a similar problem for itself in spades with the national lockdown in the spring that landed like a lead balloon in parts of the country where the epidemic had not yet reached. We may still be paying for this “cry wolf” episode.<br />For what it’s worth, I see universal mask compliance and yet my state is enduring a surge right along with the others. I see virtue signaling on TV by anchors in a position to infect nobody but a camera. I see slippage below the nose which defeats the purpose of masking up. I see obstreperous old guys who recognize that a mask is a useful tool but get their backs up over people politicizing and fetishizing it.</td>

      <td>Here are seven major companies whose stocks moved on the week’s news</td>
      <td>Spending projections are sliding at two of the world’s energy giants. Chevron Corp. on Thursday said it will cut its annual capital spending budget by 26% next year and sharply through the middle of next decade, as the coronavirus pandemic forces an industry-wide reappraisal of fossil fuel investment. That followed  Exxon Mobil Corp.’s  retreat from a plan to increase spending to boost its oil-and-gas production as the struggling company reassesses its next decade. Chevron shares fell 0.1 % Thursday.<br />General Motors Co. is tapping the brakes on its relationship with electric-truck startup  Nikola Corp.  The Detroit auto giant revealed Monday it is scaling back a pact that had fueled investor enthusiasm for both companies. Under the revised deal, GM still intends to provide Nikola with fuel-cell technology but is scrapping plans to build an electric pickup truck called the Badger for Nikola and will no longer take a stake in the company. The move comes after a short seller’s report raised questions about the readiness of some aspects of Nikola’s business, allegations the company said were false and misleading. GM shares fell 2.7% Monday.<br /><br />A new face-off is unfolding in the world of beauty. Sephora plans to install 850 shops inside Kohl’s Corp. stores by 2023, upending the beauty retailer’s longstanding partnership with  J.C. Penney Co.  That follows  Ulta Beauty Inc.’s  deal announced in November to open more than 100 shops inside  Target Corp.  stores by next year. Beauty has been one of retail’s brighter spots during the pandemic. Department stores are struggling to find new revenue sources as shoppers turn to fast-fashion chains, discount retailers and e-commerce players. Shares of Kohl’s rose 13% Tuesday.<br /></td>

      <td>Lawmakers are currently negotiating details of a roughly $900 billion plan</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A sharp decline in job growth in November further prodded lawmakers to pursue an agreement on coronavirus relief, as negotiators hurried to craft a bill before a government funding deadline at the end of next week.<br />Fitful efforts to pass another aid package came back to life this week when a bipartisan group of rank-and-file lawmakers rolled out a $908 billion proposal, and top Democrats on Capitol Hill quickly said the plan should be the framework for negotiations going forward.<br />Several aid programs instituted in the spring expire at the end of year, squeezing lawmakers to pass more relief after months of failed negotiations.<br />Members of both parties pointed to Friday’s jobs report as further impetus for quick action. Employers added 245,000 jobs last month, less than half the 610,00 jobs added in October, and the unemployment rate dropped slightly to 6.7%. Many Americans are seeing temporary furloughs become permanent.<br />“We had some not-so-good news on the job front that further necessitates our taking action,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said at a news conference Friday.</td>

The amount held by S&P 500 companies not in the financial, transportation or utility sectors is expected to total around $1.9 trillion, according to data compiled by S&P Dow Jones Indices.

They have criticized Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, both Republicans, and called on them to investigate and overturn the results. State election officials have strongly defended the election and how it has been handled.<br />The discord of the election has opened up deep rifts within GOP ranks in the state, which has been dominated by the Republican Party for decades.<br />Mr. Trump is heading to Georgia on Saturday to campaign for incumbent GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who are fighting to hold onto their seats in a pair of key Jan. 5 runoffs that will determine control of the U.S. Senate. Mr. Perdue is facing Democrat Jon Ossoff, and Ms. Loeffler is facing Democrat Raphael Warnock.<br />Mr. Raffensperger said this week that the latest of two recounts is expected to confirm that Mr. Biden won the state. Mr. Trump and his supporters have called on Georgia officials to reexamine signatures on absentee-ballot envelopes, something the Secretary of State’s Office says is unnecessary because the signatures were already checked before ballots were counted.</td>

His campaign had $18.4 million in cash on hand and about $11.3 million in payments owed to vendors as of Nov. 23, according to Federal Election Commission reports filed late Thursday.<br />His campaign’s cash position was boosted by an unprecedented postelection email-and-text-messaging fundraising drive to service campaign debt, fund other political committees and finance his court battle, which hasn’t shown election-changing evidence of voter fraud.<br />The Trump campaign had spent more than $8.8 million on its recount effort as of late November, according to the new FEC reports, which cover the period from Oct. 15 to Nov. 23. Expenses include a $3 million filing fee for a Wisconsin recount and $2.6 million in legal consulting, including a $30,000 payment to legal team member Jenna Ellis.<br />There is no documented payment to Rudy Giuliani, who is spearheading the legal team, nor to Sidney Powell, whom Mr. Trump and others first described as a team member and later said was no longer part of it.</td>

      <td>Overseas companies registered in U.S. would have to declare their true ownership</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Congress is set to approve legislation requiring companies in the U.S. to register their true owners, plugging what many illicit-finance experts say is one of the biggest holes in U.S. anti-money-laundering rules.<br />Lawmakers in both parties late Thursday announced an agreement to overhaul the framework for fighting money laundering. The measures are expected to be voted on as soon as next week as part of an annual defense-policy bill.<br />Proponents have been trying to pass so-called beneficial-ownership legislation for nearly two decades but have been blocked by groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world’s largest business group, and the American Bar Association, according to advocates. But the Chamber has dropped its opposition and now supports the measure as lawmakers addressed the group’s privacy concerns.<br />Among the biggest changes: handing federal officials the true identities of company owners that had previously been allowed to operate anonymously, through the creation of a new registry at the Treasury Department. While information on beneficial owners of companies registering in the U.S. won’t be available to the public, law enforcement would have access to the data under the legislation.<br />Under existing law, companies aren’t under any federal obligation to report the true owners who benefit from its operations. Agents can register on behalf of owners in many U.S. states, or other companies owned by the true owners can be cited as the owners, allowing the true owners to create a string of shell companies that obscure their identities.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—U.S. exports and imports both rose for a fifth straight month in October, reflecting a continued recovery in global commerce driven by a strong economic rebound in China.<br />Exports from the U.S. rose 2.2% to $182.0 billion from the previous month, while imports rose 2.1% to $245.1 billion, the Commerce Department said Friday. The trade deficit widened to $63.1 billion from $62.1 billion. The figures were adjusted for seasonal variations.<br />Global trade has recovered more quickly than economists expected since widespread lockdowns were imposed in March and April, but activity remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Economists say the outlook for trade remains uncertain amid a resurgence of the virus and renewed lockdowns in the U.S. and Europe.<br />“Virus transmissions remain elevated, and widening restrictions on activity, at home and abroad, have the potential to disrupt supply chains and weigh on demand,” Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics said in a research note.<br />Compared with a year earlier, U.S. exports in October were down 13.5%, while imports fell 3.3%. The deficit increased 47% year-over-year.</td>

      <td>Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said Friday that although the latest job creation data is disappointing, he wasn’t yet ready to call for changes in central-bank monetary policy.<br />Instead, he said government aid, which can be targeted and deployed quickly, is the most effective way to deliver new support to the U.S. economy right now, and is more potent relative to what the Fed can do with its suite of tools.<br />The November data, which showed moderating levels of job creation, was “weaker than I was expecting,” Mr. Evans told reporters after remarks to a Michigan banking group. But even so, he said he doesn’t see a need for the Fed to alter its path in what remains a time of high uncertainty.<br />“The most important source of stimulus for the economy over the next few months is some type of fiscal support and increase in public health safety support,” Mr. Evans said. “I think that that would be quicker. I think that that’s most relevant at the moment” compared with actions the Federal Reserve could take.<br />In a separate appearance, Minneapolis Fed leader Neel Kashakari joined with Mr. Evans in expressing concern about the slow pace of job creation. The government said the jobless rate stood at 6.7% last month—it’s down from a shockingly high 14.7% in April—but many economists noted the drop in unemployment was actually driven by people leaving the labor force.</td>

But public-health experts and some governments are worried that too much relaxation over the coming holiday period could trigger another rebound in contagion.</td>
