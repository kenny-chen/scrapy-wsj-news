      <td>Daimler’s shareholder-friendly decision to split its car and truck divisions will be hard for Germany’s largest car maker to ignore</td>
      <td>Germany is slowly becoming more welcoming to stock investors. If Daimler and  Siemens  can shake off the old obsession with scale, even change at  Volkswagen  may not be too much to hope for.<br />Late on Wednesday, automotive group Daimler said it will split in two, separating its flagship  Mercedes-Benz  car division from its often-overlooked truck unit—the global leader in big rigs thanks to Freightliner and other brands. The move wasn’t a huge surprise after years of rumors and preparations. But the decision to finally press the button couldn’t be taken for granted at a company that embodies the German industrial tradition, and the structure of the deal was more shareholder-friendly than expected. Shares have risen 8% since the announcement.<br />The case for a split is the classic one against conglomerates: Heavy trucks and cars don’t have much in common, and separate stock-market listings will focus management and release trapped value for shareholders. This was particularly obvious for Daimler because each of the two units has a close peer— BMW  for Mercedes-Benz and  Volvo  AB for Daimler Trucks—that usually make better margins and fetch higher valuations.<br />Crucially, Daimler is distributing a “significant majority” of stock in its truck business to its shareholders, rather than planning an initial public offering. In 2019, Volkswagen went down the IPO route with its own truck spinoff,  Traton ,  only to create a company with very limited stock-market liquidity in which it still owns a majority stake. Daimler has learnt the lesson.<br />It has perhaps also learned from Siemens, another German industrial icon that has slimmed down in recent years by selling or spinning off businesses. The strategy became the leitmotif of former chief executive Joe Kaeser, who also sits on Daimler’s supervisory board. Mr. Kaeser retired from Siemens on Wednesday with the stock at a record high, in stark contrast to U.S. peer  General Electric .</td>

      <td>SÃO PAULO—Brazilian miner  Vale  agreed to pay $7 billion in compensation to the state of Minas Gerais where the collapse of its dam two years ago killed 270 people, polluted rivers and obliterated the surrounding landscape.<br />Thursday’s settlement, the biggest court settlement in Brazilian history, according to prosecutors, is intended to compensate the state for the socioeconomic damage caused by the disaster, but it doesn’t affect a slew of pending homicide and environmental charges in the case.<br />When Vale’s dam burst in Brumadinho in January 2019 it unleashed a tsunami of mining waste down the valley at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour, wiping out the on-site canteen as many workers were at lunch, as well as destroying nearby homes and a guest house.<br />“Vale is committed to fully repair and compensate the damage caused by the tragedy in Brumadinho and to increasingly contribute to the improvement and development of the communities in which we operate,” Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Bartolomeo said in a statement. “We know that we have work to do and we remain firm in that purpose.”<br />Write to Samantha Pearson at samantha.pearson@wsj.com and Jeffrey T.

But it leaves initial claims—a proxy for layoffs—at a higher weekly level than before the winter surge in coronavirus cases.<br />Weekly claims had increased since November, when they were consistently below a seasonally adjusted 800,000, to reach 927,000 during the week of Jan. 9, the Labor Department said. Current levels remain well above the pre-pandemic peak of 695,000 and are higher than in any previous recession for records tracing back to 1967.<br />The Labor Department lowered its estimate for claims in the prior week to 812,000 from 847,000.<br />“I think this winter is going to be particularly tough on the job market,” said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The path of the economy is tied to the hip of the pandemic.”</td>

Contracts linked to the Nasdaq-100 Index climbed 0.4%, pointing to a rise in technology stocks.<br />Investors are watching for signs that the economic recovery remains under way despite a high number of Covid-19 cases and new variants that existing inoculations may be less effective against. A handful of stocks that grew popular on online forums and posted big swings in recent days have also calmed. Meanwhile, vaccine rollouts are ramping up in the U.S., offering hope that there may be a sharp rebound later in the year.<br />“The move now is for cautious optimism: the market is turning back to fundamentals,” said Grace Peters, an investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “Volatility is here to stay, but markets will ultimately grind higher.”<br />The latest data on jobless claims showed that 779,000 people applied for initial benefits last week, a decline from the previous week, but still at a historically high level. Cold weather, a surge in Covid-19 case numbers and the threat of a new, highly contagious variant of the virus have contributed to a broader winter slowdown that has hindered the labor market’s recovery, economists say.</td>

Mr. Kony remains at large, despite the Obama administration in 2011 dispatching commandos from the Special Forces to help local armies kill or capture him.<br />In northern Uganda, which saw some of the heaviest combat during the insurgency, locals followed the proceedings at The Hague, Netherlands-based court on big screens erected on football fields by the court’s outreach office. Due to coronavirus restrictions, only 200 people were allowed at each location to watch Thursday’s verdict.<br />In the capital Kampala and other towns, people gathered in restaurants and bars to watch Mr. Ongwen listen stoically as the presiding judge, Bertram Schmitt, listed his crimes. Those include murders, abductions, enslavement and pillaging of refugee camps and other settlements in Uganda.</td>

She sold her bike after receiving it, Ms. Stier said, disappointed by the quality and overall experience with the company. She bought another brand.<br />Since last fall, Peloton has acknowledged logistics problems in keeping up with demand for its bikes, which start at $1,895 and are equipped with a screen that shows subscription workout classes. The nine-year-old company has cited surging demand, shipping logjams, particularly at ports as the bikes are transported to the U.S. from manufacturers overseas, and weather disruptions. The pressures haven’t let up as demand continues to surge from people wanting to exercise at home amid Covid-19.<br />“Rapidly scaling a business during a global pandemic is difficult,” Peloton Chief Executive John Foley said in November.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden, faced with a range of early foreign policy challenges, is expected to outline his vision for an expansion of multilateral engagement with the world and an emphasis on human rights during a State Department visit Thursday.<br />In his first foreign policy speech as president, Mr. Biden plans to shift from the Trump administration’s “America First” doctrine and emphasize traditional U.S. alliances, according to a senior administration official. The president, who will be accompanied by Vice President Kamala Harris, is also expected to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and address State Department employees in what will mark his first trip to a cabinet agency since taking office.<br />Former President Donald Trump was largely skeptical of Washington’s post-World War II alliances, seeing NATO members as economic competitors who should pay significantly more for their own defense. He strongly backed Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and vetoed congressional attempts to curb weapon sales to Riyadh.<br />Other actions, such as deals that led Arab countries to recognize Israel, were welcomed by Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Blinken has said Mr. Trump’s overall tough approach to China, which the previous administration targeted for unfair trade practices and what Mr. Trump said was a lack of transparency around the origins of coronavirus, is the right one, even if the Biden administration disagrees about how the policy was implemented.<br />Still, lawmakers in both parties have expressed eagerness to strengthen ties with countries where U.S. relations soured under Mr. Trump, such as Germany and other allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</td>

Shell’s peers including  Exxon Mobil Corp. ,  Chevron Corp.  and  BP  PLC also reported losses for 2020.<br />Shell said its profit was hit by a fall in oil and gas production and weak refining margins, as well as already flagged asset write-downs and charges related to onerous contracts.</td>

      <td>Investors should take at least a crumb of comfort that the market has so far avoided a major tumble thanks to GameStop</td>
      <td>The  GameStop  saga rattled a lot of people.<br />Hedge funds who shorted the stock were crushed as it soared 10-fold in five days. New buyers who were sucked in late by the prospect of quick profits then lost horribly, with the stock down 80% from its high. Even those who got in early can’t be happy to see so much of their newfound wealth evaporate. Trust in Wall Street, in the clearing system and in popular broker Robinhood have all been damaged, and opportunistic politicians from left and right have leapt on the moves to support their existing policy positions.<br />Yet, investors might reasonably be reassured by the resilience of the wider market. If that sounds odd, bear with me. Last week the broad selloff by hedge funds as they cut their leverage shook up stocks, with those heavily shorted rallying hard while the rest fell. Volatility jumped. The S&P 500 had its two worst days since October, as the effect of deleveraging was worsened by worries about the knock-on effects if a big hedge fund collapsed.<br />The market became highly sensitive to GameStop. Since the retailer was listed by then-owner Barnes & Noble in 2002, it has tended to move in the same direction as the S&P, with the 100-day correlation in their moves always being positive. Over the 10 days to Tuesday, the stock has moved in the same direction only twice, and the 100-day correlation is now negative. What was good for GameStop was bad for the market, and vice versa.<br />The reason for comfort is that stocks didn’t suffer more. It isn’t so much that we should be relieved that GameStop and the broader coordinated attacks by users of Reddit didn’t bring down a broker or start a chain reaction of hedge-fund failures, although of course that would have been very bad. The good news is that these worries didn’t trigger a significant correction.</td>

      <td>After its spinoff of Match Group and Vimeo, IAC lacks an obvious superstar</td>
      <td>If you blinked recently, you might not recognize IAC/InterActiveCorp’s new lineup. It seems like just yesterday that it was an online dating powerhouse with a call option on home improvement. Today its edge looks less defined.<br />After spinning off online dating giant Match Group Inc.  last year, tech holding company IAC said in December it will also spin off video hosting and sharing platform Vimeo. That company has been a standout performer amid the pandemic, growing revenue by an average of 50% year-over-year for the past seven months, including January, according to preliminary monthly metrics released by IAC on Wednesday. That makes it one of IAC’s best-performing assets, aside from one or two of the smaller companies housed in the company’s “emerging and other” category.<br />So what is left? IAC’s latest scorecard shows it has some rookie prospects but lacks an obvious superstar. The company reported fourth-quarter results on Wednesday that were slightly ahead of Wall Street’s expectations, with revenue growing 27%, up from the 12% growth reported in the third quarter. But January metrics look dicier. IAC’s largest remaining asset,  ANGI Homeservices  makes up 42% of its overall top line. That business has been highly volatile over the past 12 months, posting 21% growth last February compared with a year earlier, declining to 7% in July and to 6% most recently in January. The company attributed ANGI’s most recent performance declines to tough comparisons due to an accounting change and lingering pandemic effects.<br />Those factors haven’t pinched other parts of IAC’s business, at least. Recently acquired Care.com appears to be going strong, as evidenced by the 120% year-over-year revenue growth in IAC’s emerging and other segment in January. And relatively unknown digital media company Dotdash grew revenue 53% last month compared with a year earlier—its highest growth rate on that basis in at least a year. Still, Dotdash’s revenue amounts to less than 10% of IAC’s overall top line, even excluding Vimeo.<br />In IAC’s latest shareholder letter, posted Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Joey Levin reminded investors of the company’s history of building up to pare down, only to rebuild all over again. It is clear from the letter that the company is now soundly in rebuilding mode, but the specific game plan is less apparent. It is certainly part of IAC’s modus operandi to take misunderstood or underappreciated businesses and turn them into stars. Based on recent performance, it is entirely possible that Dotdash and Care.com might fit that bill.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—Australia’s decision to close its borders protected it from the coronavirus. But that policy is wreaking havoc on the country’s universities, which relied on lucrative tuition from foreign students who are stuck overseas.<br />Experts say it will take years for the schools, among the best in the world, to recover from the economic damage. Already, Australian universities have cut more than 17,000 jobs, according to industry group Universities Australia. It said operating revenue fell 4.9% last year and is expected to fall another 5.5% this year.<br />“As students finish and we haven’t got new ones coming, we’re yet to hit the bottom basically,” said Peter Hurley, a policy fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Education and Health Policy, which forecast that the country’s universities could lose up to $15 billion in international tuition through 2023.<br />Leaders all over the world have needed to balance protecting their populations from the virus with the economic damage that those policies can cause. But with a vaccine rollout expected to start in Australia soon, pressure is ramping up on conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison to provide clarity on how and when international students could return.<br />Leaders in the nation’s states and territories have pressed for some places in the quarantine system to be reserved for international students, but Mr. Morrison has argued that returning Australians must come first. Thousands of Australians remain stranded overseas because the government has imposed caps on returning travelers, part of an effort to ease pressure on its hotel quarantine system and to minimize the risk of highly contagious variants of the coronavirus from spreading into the community.</td>

      <td>The North Korean regime has lasted longer than the Soviet Union despite economic hardship, human-rights abuses and sometimes deadly family rivalries</td>
      <td>The Kim family has governed North Korea since Soviet leader Joseph Stalin installed clan patriarch Kim Il Sung as head of state after World War II. To consolidate and maintain power through three generations, the ruling Kims have purged, coaxed or murdered rivals and elites, sometimes even within the family. To deter American-led military action and secure the regime’s longer-term political survival, they have driven the development of nuclear weapons. The family has led the isolated country for more than seven decades—longer than the Soviet Union existed—and remains unchallenged despite widespread poverty, an appalling human-rights record and the pressure of economic sanctions.<br />Kim Jong Un is the third leader of North Korea. He gained power in December 2011, upon the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, who had officially ruled since Kim Il Sung’s death in 1994. Kim Jong Un was just 27 years old when he took the reins, according to the South Korean government, which puts his birth date at Jan. 8, 1984.<br />He had spent much of his life out of the spotlight, in family palaces in Pyongyang and a boarding school in Switzerland, before being catapulted into prominence just 14 months earlier, when his ailing father presented him as his heir apparent during a Workers’ Party event.<br />Little at the time was known about the new leader, thought to be Kim Jong Il’s third son. North Korea experts believe Kim Jong Un was more ambitious and politically acute than his older brothers, spurring their father—himself a first son—to pick him despite his younger age.<br />After inheriting power, Kim Jong Un accelerated development of nuclear weapons, testing more missiles and nuclear bombs than his father and grandfather combined. By 2017, North Korea had a missile that weapons experts said had the range to hit Washington, D.C., though the pursuit left the country awash in economic sanctions.</td>

      <td>Most companies caught in the Reddit-fueled rally don’t mind the extra bump in their share prices. For others, it is a shot in the arm that hurts.</td>
      <td>Individual investors cheering on the Reddit-fueled rally of heavily shorted stocks were out to “eat the rich,” not the companies themselves. In an unfortunate twist of fate and timing, the frenzy could end up taking a bite out of  Bed Bath & Beyond .<br />The culprit is an accelerated share repurchase agreement—known as an ASR—that Bed Bath & Beyond announced well before the Reddit-fueled rally pushed up heavily shorted stocks like the company’s own. Such an agreement exposes the company to the short end of the trade, on the same side as the hedge funds that the day traders were out to deplete. For a heavily shorted stock initiating an ASR, an army of investors out to destroy short sellers can be a truly terrifying scenario.<br />While ASRs are nothing new, the sheer magnitude of stock price surges this past week highlights the potential riskiness of the method.<br />In an ASR, a company buys back shares in one large chunk from a dealer—in Bed Bath & Beyond’s case, it was JPMorgan—that typically will deliver shares it borrowed from institutional investors. The bank must then cover its short position by buying back the company’s shares in the open market over a period. If the share price rises, the company must compensate the bank for the difference between what it paid the bank for the initial share delivery and what the bank paid to buy those shares in the market, typically based on a volume-weighted average price. This difference can be settled either by cash or shares.<br />In some cases, a company will structure an ASR with “collars” or caps on the per-share price it will ultimately have to pay, limiting downside in case share prices spike. In many cases, including Bed Bath & Beyond’s, the agreement is uncollared.  Dollar Tree  and Monsanto are among the companies that have bought back shares using this structure.</td>

On Thursday, it reported a bumper annual profit.<br />Driving the bank’s results was booming activity from clients as they adjusted their needs and investment portfolios. The German lender’s investment banking results offset more challenging conditions for its bread-and-butter lending business, which has been hit by negative interest rates.<br />Some analysts, however, have questioned the sustainability of the results. Deutsche Bank shares were down over 1% midmorning.<br />Lower costs and lower-than-expected losses from bad loans drove it to a €624 million profit for the year, equivalent to $749 million, swinging from a €5.27 billion loss in 2019. It is the most significant profit the bank has made in six years, which were mostly marked by big losses.<br />“We have built firm foundations for sustainable profitability, and are confident that this overall positive trend will continue in 2021, despite these challenging times,” Chief Executive Christian Sewing said.</td>

The initial public offering is the world’s largest in more than a year, according to Dealogic, and gives the company a market value of nearly $61 billion.<br />This is the latest in a string of hot IPOs in Hong Kong, many involving Chinese technology startups or other companies catering to China’s increasingly affluent consumers. Last year, for example, bottled-water group  Nongfu Spring Co.  jumped on its debut, while the abortive dual listing of Ant Group Co. in Shanghai and Hong Kong generated trillions of dollars of demand.<br />Kuaishou earlier priced the stock sale at 115 Hong Kong dollars a share, equivalent to $14.84 a share. Unofficial gray-market pricing Thursday suggested Kuaishou’s stock could leap in value when it starts trading Friday. The stock closed at HK$336.60 a share on a trading platform operated by Futu Securities, almost triple the IPO price.<br />Joe Chang, a manager at an e-commerce company in Shenzhen, said he was allotted just 100 shares after placing an order for 50,000, and that he used borrowed money for 90% of the total. Mr. Chang said he liked the company as a market leader in short video and live-streaming, and because rival ByteDance is unlisted. He said Kuaishou’s market value could rise to $150 billion.</td>

Its brands include Firesteed Cellars, Viansa Sonoma, Cameron Hughes and Bar Dog, among others. Generally, the business sells the majority of its wines for roughly $12 to $20 a bottle.<br />Although the coronavirus pandemic has made wine sales volume difficult to pinpoint, a recent annual report on the industry by Silicon Valley Bank suggests U.S. wine sales volume remained flat to slightly up last year, driven partly by restaurant and tasting-room closures. Domestic wine sales totaled around 301.5 million cases, up only around 1.5% from 2019 levels, according to the report, which cited data from alcoholic beverage research firm bw166. The report, however, projects that sales will pick up this year as more people get vaccinated and social-distancing restrictions ease.</td>

Last March 24, those Games were postponed for a year. Similarly, neither Bach nor Xi has addressed the possibility that Beijing 2022 could be delayed or canceled because of the pandemic.<br />But concerns are surfacing that China’s vaccine rollout is undershooting expectations, delaying the country’s ability to attain herd immunity. The Beijing Games also face calls for a boycott over Beijing’s handling of Hong Kong and its far western region of Xinjiang.<br />Another problem: the pandemic has shredded the training and competition calendars of aspiring 2022 Winter Olympians. Canceled events include key test events for the Beijing hosts, such as the Grand Prix Final for figure skating that was set to take place in December 2020, but was halted due to countries’ unwillingness to send skaters.</td>

      <td>Payment for order flow enabled zero-commission trades but has long been controversial</td>
      <td>The Reddit-fueled frenzy in stocks such as  GameStop Corp.  and  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  is prompting calls for regulators to reconsider a decades-old practice in the U.S. stock market: payment for order flow.<br />The practice, in which high-speed trading firms pay brokerages for the right to execute orders submitted by mom-and-pop investors, has long been controversial. Some say it warps the incentives of brokers and encourages them to maximize their revenue at the expense of customers. Supporters, including many brokers and trading firms, say it is misunderstood and helps ensure that investors get seamless executions and good prices on their trades.<br />Either way, it is big money. Last year, brokerages such as  Charles Schwab Corp. , TD Ameritrade, Robinhood Markets Inc. and E*Trade collected nearly $2.6 billion in payments for stock and option orders, according to an analysis of company filings by JMP Securities. The biggest sources of the payments were electronic trading firms such as Citadel Securities, Susquehanna International Group LLP and  Virtu Financial Inc.<br />Payment for order flow helped set the stage for the manic trading in GameStop, whose shares began the year around $18, surged to a record close of $347.51 on Jan. 27 and ended Wednesday’s session at $92.41.<br />That is because payment for order flow made it possible for the U.S. brokerage industry to shift to zero-commission trades in late 2019. No longer needing to pay a fee on stock transactions and empowered by easy-to-use trading apps like Robinhood, individual investors poured into stocks and options at record levels last year. More recently, they snapped up stocks like GameStop that were being touted on Reddit and other social-media platforms.</td>

Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), the incoming head of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, will propose broad changes to U.S. antitrust laws Thursday as the newly Democratic-led Congress begins to press the issue of perceived monopoly power in technology and other industries.<br />The senator plans to introduce legislation that would bar companies that dominate their sectors from making acquisitions unless they can prove their deals don’t “create an appreciable risk of materially lessening competition,” according to a draft from Ms. Klobuchar’s office. Now, the burden is on the government to prove a merger substantially lessens competition.<br />The proposals will likely face headwinds. Republicans didn’t sign on to many of the ideas when Ms. Klobuchar floated them during the previous session of Congress, and businesses including big technology companies are expected to oppose a significant rewriting of antitrust laws.<br />Ms. Klobuchar is hoping that Democrats’ control of the Senate will improve odds of passage, and she will seek to build momentum through a series of legislative hearings focused on monopoly power.<br />“We have an increasing monopoly problem, really headlined by what is happening with tech” but also extending across the economy, Ms. Klobuchar said.  “Our laws have to be as sophisticated as those that are messing around with competition,” she said.</td>

It blamed the macroeconomic and credit environment.<br />The company specializes in developing industrial parks and entire new districts. As recently as 2018, its flagship development Gu’an New Industry City, south of Beijing, was heralded as “a model for the kinds of ‘new type’ urbanization that the Chinese government hopes to see develop across the country,” according to a report from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and E-House China, a property data and information services website.<br />Analysts tend to present every troubled real-estate company in China as an idiosyncratic case, but a rapid slide in China Fortune Land’s credit ratings naturally raises questions about which other property developers are currently enjoying an unrealistically low cost of capital. Since January,  Moody’s Investors Service  and Fitch Ratings have downgraded the company four and seven notches, respectively, putting it deep into junk territory. That’s a demonstration of just how quickly things can change.<br />The pricing of the company’s bonds suggests the same.

The majority of the money will be paid upfront, with the rest dispensed in four yearly payments starting in 2022.<br />McKinsey said last week it is cooperating with government agencies on matters related to its past work with opioid manufacturers, as state and local governments sue companies up and down the opioid supply chain. At least 400,000 people have died in the U.S. from overdoses of legal and illegal opioids since 1999, according to federal data.<br />The consulting firm stopped doing opioid-related work in 2019 and said in December its work for Purdue was intended to support the legal use of opioids and help patients with legitimate medical needs.<br />While some companies have reached deals with individual states to avoid trials, the McKinsey settlement marks the first nationwide opioid pact to come from the flood of litigation that began in 2017. A much larger, $26 billion deal with three drug distributors and Johnson & Johnson has been in the works for more than a year but is still being negotiated.</td>

      <td>New federal charges were filed against two members of the far-right Proud Boys in connection to last month’s storming of the U.S. Capitol.<br />Ethan Nordean, also known as “Rufio Panman,” was arrested and charged Wednesday with obstructing an official proceeding, aiding and abetting, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, among other charges.<br />Nicholas Ochs, the leader of the Hawaii chapter of the Proud Boys, also faces new charges in a grand jury indictment obtained Wednesday, including conspiracy to obstruct Congress, and stealing and destroying government property. He was previously arrested on lesser charges connected to the riot.<br />Messrs. Nordean and Ochs couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. Mr. Ochs hasn’t yet entered any plea to the charges.<br />Since the riot on Jan. 6, prosecutors have moved to arrest more than 150 participants of the pro-Trump mob on basic charges, including unlawfully entering a restricted building, and prosecutors said they planned to build more sophisticated cases through indictments in the ensuing weeks.</td>

      <td>Canadian regulators on Wednesday said facial-recognition-software company Clearview AI Inc. violated federal and provincial privacy laws in the country by offering its services there, though they acknowledged having limited enforcement powers in penalizing the New York-based company and others like it.<br />Regulators said Clearview collected “highly sensitive biometric information without the knowledge or consent of individuals,” affecting millions of Canadians. Clearview has a database of about 3 billion photos it scraped from the internet, allowing it to search for matches using facial recognition algorithms. The practices violated federal and provincial laws, regulators said, including in Quebec where express consent is required to use biometric data.<br />Officials with four Canadian regulatory agencies said they completed an investigation into Clearview that began last February, finding that the company served 48 accounts for law enforcement agencies and other organizations across the country, including a paid subscription by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.<br />Clearview said its technology is no longer available in Canada and that it will remove data on Canadian citizens upon their requests.<br />The investigation is the latest case involving Clearview and privacy regulators, the most prominent in this case being the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Last week the The Hamburg Data Protection Authority said Clearview’s activities are illegal under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.</td>

He said the board is currently controlled by conservative political donor Rebekah Mercer.<br />“Over the past few months, I’ve met constant resistance to my product vision, my strong belief in free speech and my view of how the Parler site should be managed,” he said in a statement. “For example, I advocated for more product stability and what I believe is a more effective approach to content moderation.”<br />The immediate impact on Parler’s efforts to restore service to its roughly 15 million users isn’t known, though a person familiar with the company said Mr. Matze was responsible for creating much of Parler’s original code.<br />In the months following the U.S. presidential election, Parler carved out a niche but rapidly growing place in social media by wooing conservatives disaffected by mainstream platforms’ efforts to label certain posts and ban users whom they deemed to have violated their guidelines around hate speech, misinformation and false claims of victory by former President Donald Trump.</td>

      <td>Academics and the progressive press mull state media controls.</td>
      <td>The academic establishment and progressive press want you to know two things: First, conservative claims of social-media bias are bogus. As Silicon Valley firms police content, their decisions are, miraculously, wholly uninfluenced by ideological preference.<br />Second, there is an urgent need for a much wider crackdown on political speech, perhaps led by the Biden Administration and requiring the creation of new government agencies. In other words, all that conservative suppression that’s, er, not happening? We need more of it.<br />New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights released a brief this week that is being amplified in the press entitled, “False Accusation: The Unfounded Claim that Social Media Companies Censor Conservatives.” It argues that “some conservatives believe their content is suppressed on partisan grounds when, in fact, it’s being singled out because it violates neutral platform rules.”<br />That is sometimes true, but the report doesn’t remotely prove that it always is. What about when  Twitter  and  Facebook  tried to suppress a New York Post story about Hunter Biden before the 2020 election? Even the report concedes that “the question of whether social media companies harbor an anti-conservative bias can’t be answered conclusively.”<br />That doesn’t stop the authors from unabashedly asserting that “the claim of anti-conservative animus is itself a form of disinformation.” It is perpetuated partly because “it appeals to the same conspiratorial mindset that has fostered the QAnon movement.”</td>

      <td>The monetary magician will try to pull a reform rabbit out of Italy’s hat.</td>
      <td>Mario Draghi is often credited with pulling off the near-impossible conjuring trick of saving the euro during the last decade’s serial sovereign debt crises. So wish him luck as he now attempts a similar David Copperfield act as Italy’s new Prime Minister. He’s going to need it.<br />Mr. Draghi was summoned Wednesday by Italian President Sergio Mattarella to form a government because almost no one else can. Giuseppe Conte’s government—his second coalition in two-and-a-half years—collapsed last month amid infighting over how to spend €209 billion in Covid-19 stimulus money from the European Union. Mr. Draghi’s appointment is Rome’s last hope of pulling together a new government to avoid snap elections.<br />Why Italy wants Mr. Draghi is easy enough to see. His tenure as president of the European Central Bank makes him one of Europe’s most respected politicians, a reputation he has bolstered in retirement by avoiding raucous domestic Italian politics. His gravitas might help him build support among Italian politicians for a new coalition, and it will reassure markets and European leaders that a responsible adult is steering the ship in Rome.<br />Why Mr. Draghi wants the job, however, is a mystery for the ages. He understands exactly what ails Italy’s economy—which we know because he spent his entire time at the ECB begging Rome and other European governments to implement supply-side tax and regulatory reforms. He also presumably understands the political forces that have kept those reforms from happening. Only patriotism can explain why he’s volunteering for such a thankless and futile job.<br />All the more so since his appointment itself points to a fundamental dysfunction in Rome. We say almost no one else can form a government because one other politician probably could: Matteo Salvini of the right-wing League. His coalition of center-right parties was the plurality winner in 2018’s election, and polls suggest the League and aligned parties would fare well if Italy held the snap election it probably needs.</td>

      <td>Biden bars ‘Wuhan virus’ but favors racial preferences at Yale.</td>
      <td>President Biden last week singled out Asian-Americans as he issued executive orders devoted to “advancing racial equity.” They include an order banning federal use of terms such as “Wuhan virus,” and another requiring the Justice Department to better track hate crimes against Asian-Americans. In pushing these measures Mr. Biden prefers to speak of promoting “equity” rather than equal treatment.<br />On Wednesday the Justice Department showed us why when it dropped its lawsuit against Yale University over its race-based admissions. Under former Attorney General Bill Barr, Justice had charged that Yale’s racial preferences violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Justice acted even before the Senate has confirmed a new Attorney General or head of the Civil Rights Division.<br />A similar but private suit against Harvard continues, this one brought by Students for Fair Admissions. But it’s likely the government will soon withdraw its supporting brief that scores Harvard for “systematically disfavoring Asian-American applicants.”<br />So Asian-Americans will be watching. While many will be relieved to see the government rejecting terms such as “China flu,” many also appreciate the real and present harm when America’s most competitive colleges and universities reject their children based on their race no matter their other qualifications.<br />“I am totally shocked by the Biden DOJ’s hasty decision to drop the Yale lawsuit, only eight days after President Biden signed an executive order claiming to combat anti-Asian discrimination,” says the president of the Asian American Coalition for Education, Yukong Zhao.</td>

MetLife’s decline was primarily related to mark-to-market losses on the financial hedges it buys to protect the company from falling interest rates and stock markets.<br />When rates and equities rise, as they did in the fourth quarter, the value of that protection falls. Wall Street analysts treat those declines as noneconomic and focus on adjusted earnings, which were nearly flat at $1.838 billion at MetLife from $1.834 billion in the year-ago period.<br />Allstate became the latest car insurer to report robust auto-insurance underwriting profit as the pandemic, and resulting weak U.S. economy, continued to hold down the number of miles motorists drove.<br />Fewer miles led to a sharp reduction in wrecks—and has prompted criticism from some consumer advocacy groups that springtime premium-refund programs weren’t generous enough. In those refund programs, insurers typically slashed 15% to 20% of customers’ premium bills for a couple months.</td>

Early seed sales to North American farmers and fall pesticide spraying helped Corteva deliver a small profit for the fourth quarter, which analysts had anticipated to show a loss.<br />The Delaware-based farm supplier is under pressure from activist investor Starboard Value LP. The firm in January launched an effort to oust Corteva’s chief executive, Jim Collins, and replace most of the company’s board of directors. Starboard said Corteva’s profits have been stagnant and that Mr. Collins hasn’t acted decisively to change that.<br />Corteva’s board has stood behind Mr. Collins.

      <td>International law has no remedy for property crimes a government against its own citizens, a unanimous court rules</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court stopped Holocaust victims and their descendants from seeking compensation in U.S. courts for property allegedly seized by Nazi Germany and its ally Hungary, ruling Wednesday that international law provides no remedy for property crimes a government commits against its own citizens.<br />The unanimous court acted in two separate suits over different types of property. One involved the Guelph Treasure, a collection of medieval German relics that Nazi leader Hermann Goering allegedly coerced a consortium of Jewish art dealers to sell in the 1930s at a third of its value. The other suit involved the Hungarian state railway MAV, which allegedly stripped Jews of their personal possessions before forcibly transporting them to Nazi death camps during World War II.<br />Foreign governments generally are immune from lawsuits in American courts, but Congress has created several exceptions. A federal appeals court in Washington found the Holocaust cases qualified, because the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act permits suits over “property taken in violation of international law.”<br />Because genocide violates international law, property taken from Jews as the Nazi extermination campaign progressed could be recovered in U.S. courts, the appellate court reasoned.<br />At the high court, however, writing in the lead case, Germany v. Philipp, Chief Justice John Roberts said the appeals panel had misconstrued the meaning of that exception. Rather than applying to property taken during the violation of international law, he wrote, the exception covered only a property taking that itself violated international law—that is, when a government illegally seizes the property of another country’s citizen.</td>

Following the senators’ meeting with Mr. Biden, she defended the president’s stimulus plan as “carefully designed” and focused on “pressing needs.” The president “will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment,” she concluded.<br />The administration’s package was neither “carefully designed” nor focused only on “pressing needs.” It’s a mishmash of the good, the bad and the in-between, tilted toward delivering cash to blue states and putting in place permanent big-government programs under the guise of temporary emergency measures.<br />Take stimulus checks. Mr. Biden would spend $465 billion on $1,400 checks, Republicans $220 billion on $1,000 checks. Two-earner couples with lots of children making up to $300,000 a year can get Biden checks, as can college students, spouses who are illegal aliens, and other adult dependents excluded from previous rounds of checks.<br />Republicans would focus on the truly needy, phasing out checks for individuals making more than $50,000 a year and couples making more than $100,000. Their approach recognizes that most people added to savings or paid down debt with previous checks and didn’t stimulate the economy by spending them.<br />In criticizing the GOP approach, an unnamed “senior administration official” told Politico that Republicans will “get no credit” when the larger Democratic checks pass, leaving them at a political disadvantage.

In Beijing’s eyes, this makes Washington the demandeur—in diplomatic parlance, the one asking for something. It is never a preferred position in negotiations. You want China to take action on climate change? asks Xi Jinping. Let’s talk about what you’re going to give to get it.<br />Climate diplomacy czar John Kerry knows he has a problem. Taking his first swing last week, he whiffed. Mr. Kerry told the world, “The stakes on climate change just simply couldn’t be any higher than they are right now. It is existential.” He added that Mr. Biden is “totally seized by this issue.” Asked about handling China, given the many contentious disagreements, Mr. Kerry answered that “those issues will never be traded for anything” relating to climate change, which “is a critical stand-alone issue” that it is “urgent that we find a way to compartmentalize, to move forward.”<br />He didn’t explain how he’d compartmentalize. Nor does former Obama official John Podesta, who recently said that climate change “changes defense posture, it changes foreign policy posture” and “begins to drive a lot of decision making.” He then contradicted himself, urging Mr. Biden to build “a protected lane in which the other issues don’t shut down the conversation on climate change.” Driving down that protected lane will be interesting.<br />Climate adviser Gina McCarthy compounded the confusion, stressing that “we have to start shifting to clean energy, but it has to be manufactured in the United States of America, you know, not in other countries.” Her own words prove that “compartmentalization” is a fantasy. Moreover, she underscored the risk, distinctly present under Mr. Trump, that national security concerns can easily devolve into old-fashioned industrial policy.</td>

      <td>‘USA Today confirmed that all of the details of the Instagram post, including the quote, were absolutely correct. Why, then, did it flag it as misleading?’</td>
      <td>From “Lincoln High School and the Latest Fact-Checking Pitfalls” by Kalev Leetrau, RealClearPolitics.com, Feb. 2:<br /><br />On Dec. 16, Not the Bee, which describes itself as a “humor-based news, opinion, and entertainment site,” shared on its Instagram account a photograph of Abraham Lincoln titled “San Francisco to rename ABRAHAM LINCOLN High School because—I swear this is real—‘he did not show that black lives ever mattered to him.’ ” Four days later,  Facebook  fact-checking partner USA Today (which receives funding from Facebook) published a fact check of the post, issuing a verdict that it was “Missing Context.” This means that anyone viewing the Instagram post since then has seen a large red warning label saying, “Missing Context. Independent fact-checkers say information in this post could mislead people.”<br />In its fact check, USA Today confirmed that all of the details of the Instagram post, including the quote, were absolutely correct. Why, then, did it flag it as misleading? In the paper’s words, “It is true that a renaming committee included Abraham Lincoln High School on a list of 44 schools whose namesakes met its renaming criteria. But the committee has not finalized its recommendations, and the school board has not voted on the name changes—so at this time, it’s not accurate to say that the school will be renamed.”</td>

      <td>Social media, besides flooding the world with narcissism and malevolence, generates loneliness. How to overcome it?</td>
      <td>Covid is a curse, yet some citizens have prospered during its grim visitation—and not only virtue signalers, sweat-pants merchants and people involved in relocating New Yorkers to Florida.<br />This has also been a golden era for all who take seriously the admonition “there are two types of people in this world: avoid both like the plague.” Recluses, loners and other lovers of solitude are in full glow. Bowling alone is just what the doctor—and governor—ordered. Solitary martinis are the healthy choice. Large social gatherings, including weddings, feasts and funerals, have taken on a slight whiff of sedition.<br />Yet the loneliness that can result from the loss of human interaction constitutes another plague, according to Billy Baker, a staff writer at the Boston Globe. “Name a health condition you don’t want and there’s a study linking it to loneliness,” he writes in “We Need to Hang Out: A Memoir of Making Friends.” “Diabetes. Obesity. Alzheimer’s. Heart disease. Cancer. One study found that in terms of damage to your health, loneliness was the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day.”<br />For some, that’s a small price to pay for skipping church with society’s blessing or declining an invitation to dine with Aunt Madge and Uncle Joe. But Mr. Baker sees a worsening contagion. A 2019 survey found that 61% of Americans are “measurably lonely,” a seven-point jump from the previous year. AARP found that 42 million Americans over 45 suffer from “chronic loneliness,” while Brigham Young University, analyzing data from more than three million people over more than three decades, found that lonely people “saw their risk of premature death rise by up to 32 percent.” We are, Mr. Baker warns, “in the midst of a full-blown loneliness epidemic,” and it was gathering steam well before Covid arrived.<br />Television continues to hypnotize and isolate, he notes; even people between 15 and 44—“the original smartphone junkies”—surrender two hours each day to the one-eyed monster. Social media, besides flooding the world with narcissism and malevolence, generates loneliness. Mr. Baker cites a study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine showing that heavy social-media users (more than 50 visits a week) were three times more likely to feel lonely than light users (nine or less). “Each time something new moves online and stops happening face-to-face, we deplete the world’s supply of social capital.”</td>

      <td>Rioters looting and taking selfies have nothing on Italy’s ‘Years of Lead.’</td>
      <td>Fears of insurrection have been in the air, first with last summer’s left-wing attacks on police stations, courthouses and similar facilities, then with the right-wing riot at the U.S. Capitol last month. But Italians have seen far worse. The “Years of Lead” between 1969 and 1988 saw hundreds killed in violence from both the left and right.<br />The far left at the time was represented most prominently by the Red Brigades, whose acts of terrorism included kidnappings and murders of political opponents and supporters who deviated from orthodoxy. These attacks were carefully premeditated and politically motivated. In 1978 the Red Brigades kidnapped, held hostage and murdered former Prime Minister Aldo Moro because he was mediating a coalition between his party, Christian Democracy, and the Communist Party. The Red Brigades wanted revolution, not compromise or an establishment party. It’s a far cry from antifa and Black Lives Matter supporters looting stores, burning buildings and attacking policemen indiscriminately.<br />The Italian far right was represented by dispersed and disorganized neofascist groups that rebranded after World War II. They favored bombings, most notably the massacres at Milan’s Piazza Fontana in 1969 by the New Order, which killed 17, and at Bologna’s Central Station in 1980 by the Revolutionary Armed Nucleus, which killed 85. Again, a stark difference from Trump supporters storming the Capitol wearing funny clothes, taking selfies and, like their leftist counterparts, indiscriminately attacking law enforcement.<br />All told, hundreds of innocent people were killed and many more wounded during Italy’s Years of Lead. Conspiracy theories were common. The “strategy of tension,” which imagined the state intelligence apparatus and the Central Intelligence Agency worked with the far right to cause instability that could be blamed on Communists, was popular on the left. Anti-American sentiment was rampant; the Red Brigades assassinated U.S. diplomat Leamon Hunt, who headed an international peacekeeping force, in 1984. The Italian Communist Party received funding and logistical support from the Soviets.<br />“None of this exists in the so-called insurgencies in America,” says historian Lorenzo Castellani of LUISS University of Rome. “They are very different phenomena.” Terrorism in Italy had well-defined ideological foundations and structured paramilitaries. America’s “culture wars” are largely fought between internet subcultures and personality cults formed by atomized individuals who commit disturbing but futile acts of performative violence.</td>

      <td>The Petersen Automotive Museum showcases sports cars of the uberwealthy—sports cars from Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini and more.</td>
      <td>The centerpieces of “Supercars,” the Petersen Automotive Museum’s new online video tour of an exhibit that can’t be viewed in person because of Covid-19, are the 1988 Lamborghini Countach 5000QV as well as a stable of Ferraris that defined the category from the 1950s to today. That’s as it should be. Those were the cars whose images adorned the bedroom walls of teenage boys starting in the 1960s and ’70s, usually with a bikini-clad supermodel splayed across the hood. But as this overview makes clear, covering some 30 automobiles spread across the entire 14,000 square feet of the museum’s third floor, there is much more to the history and development of so-called supercars.<br />Michael Bodell, the museum’s deputy director, is our guide (the show was curated by Exhibitions Director Bryan Stevens), and he reminds us that these playthings of the uberwealthy and well-connected have a long history. We see the 1913 Mercer Type 35-J Raceabout, which competed in the first Indianapolis 500, and the 1923 Mercedes 28/95 Targa-Florio, its high hood-line hiding what was, at the time, Mercedes’s most powerful automotive engine, adapted from aircraft technology—a 7.2-liter, inline six-cylinder that produced about 95 horsepower. While these cars may not make us think of the Lamborghinis or Ferraris to come, most of America at that time was driving Henry Ford’s boxy Model T, early models of which had 2.9-liter, inline four-cylinder engines that produced only 20 horsepower.<br />The Art Deco period’s marriage of design and function is clearly evident in the next two vehicles in the virtual tour, the 1933 Duesenberg Model SJ, an ultra-luxurious long-nosed convertible coupe popular with Hollywood celebrities of the day that put out more than 300 horsepower and had a top speed of over 130 miles per hour. While someone may have driven this car that fast, that wasn’t the purpose of buying one. Rather, it was to be seen in it—leaving onlookers agog at the silver-wrapped exhaust manifolds, spoke wheels and the distinctive flying-goddess hood ornament.<br />Art Deco’s influence is even more evident in the 1938 Delahaye 145 with a custom body by French coachbuilder Henri Chapron. One of four Delahaye Grand Prix cars, it’s really a race car whose bodywork makes it road-worthy and head-turning, with rounded, sculpted fenders, streamlined hood and sloping tail, all in an elegant blue and purple two-tone finish.<br />Where we really get into modern-day supercars is the 1952 Ferrari 212/225 Inter Spyder Barchetta, originally owned by Henry Ford II; he took it to his designers, who were inspired to create the 1950s Thunderbirds. One of the few all-original cars in the museum’s collection, it has a staid black finish with white interior and whitewall tires. Its sleek, rounded edges and open cockpit are so far removed from the top-selling American car of 1952, the Buick Roadmaster, that the two shouldn’t be discussed in the same sentence.</td>

Which it was, to a degree. But it also was a trade that pitted professionals against other professionals—and few have made more money than Senvest Management LLC, Messrs. Mashaal’s and Gonick’s firm.<br />“When it started its march, we thought, something’s percolating here,” said Mr. Mashaal, 55 years old. “But we had no idea how crazy this thing was going to get.”<br />Senvest’s interest in the videogame retailer was piqued by a presentation from the new GameStop chief executive at a consumer investment conference in January 2020.</td>

      <td>German conglomerate strikes agreement with plaintiffs’ attorneys for a $2 billion compensation program for future claims</td>
      <td>Bayer AG  is trying again to contain its liability over claims that its popular Roundup weedkiller causes cancer, unveiling Wednesday a $2 billion proposal to pay farmers and gardeners who try to blame the company for illnesses in the future.<br />The German company and plaintiffs’ lawyers said they would seek a U.S. District Court judge’s permission for a compensation program that would pay between around $5,000 and $200,000 each to future plaintiffs who contract non-Hodgkin lymphoma after using Roundup.<br />Bayer has been battling litigation over Roundup’s safety since acquiring Monsanto Co., the weedkiller’s manufacturer, in 2018. After three California juries found in favor of sick plaintiffs, Bayer agreed last June to pay up to $9.6 billion to settle existing Roundup cases. It continues to deny any link between the product and cancer.<br />That deal, however, didn’t prevent more plaintiffs from coming forward in the future. An earlier proposal to create a panel of scientific experts whose conclusions on Roundup’s safety would bind future litigants didn’t pass muster with a federal judge, and Bayer has been working with plaintiffs’ lawyers since July on a revision.<br />The new proposed class action covers those who haven’t yet hired a lawyer to pursue a Roundup claim. If approved by the court, individuals who believe Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin lymphoma can apply for a settlement from a $1.33 billion pot of money, with the offers dependent on age, health, proof of Roundup use and other factors. Those who opt out can still pursue litigation on their own, with the prospect of convincing a jury to award higher, punitive damages not available to class members. The settlement fund will last four years, with the option to extend it after that.</td>

The interest is a reflection of the widespread fascination created after GameStop shares were bid up well beyond logical measure by investors who followed the stock on social network Reddit and other platforms.<br />The movie rights to Mr. Mezrich’s proposal, titled “The Antisocial Network,” had previously been acquired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. earlier this week.</td>

But they also underscored the power that a 50-50 Senate grants individual senators. Mr. Manchin is still seeking more-targeted aid payments and a smaller increase in the federal minimum wage than what Mr. Biden proposed.<br />Mr. Manchin said he is still talking with Republicans, and that he wanted the process to be bipartisan, including giving both parties the chance to amend the legislation.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Wednesday that there will be an “open, bipartisan amendment process” as the chamber debates Democrats’ budget resolution over the next two days. He invited Republicans to participate. But he reiterated his party is committed to passing a big rescue package quickly.</td>

Radio stations and streaming services stopped promoting his music and other artists including Maren Morris, Jason Isbell and Mickey Guyton criticized him on social media.<br />Mr. Wallen has publicly apologized, saying, “I’m embarrassed and sorry. I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back.”<br />The distancing by his label, radio and streaming services pumps the brakes on what was a rocketing career for the country artist that many industry executives saw as poised to break through to a wider audience. Mr. Wallen is scheduled to tour this summer, but without the backing of many key industry players, his future career is in question.  Live Nation Entertainment Inc.,  his concert promoter, hasn’t responded to a request for comment.<br />“I won’t be surprised if he loses most of the slots on some festivals, if they should actually occur this year or next,” said Nashville-based entertainment attorney and artist manager Zach Scott Gainous. Such contracts “likely allow for cancellation for so-called ‘immoral’ behavior,” he said.</td>

      <td>Mexico’s Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that changes in regulations for the country’s electricity market giving priority to the state-owned utility over private power generators is unconstitutional.<br />The ruling is a setback for President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s plans to restore the dominance of state-owned energy companies, and bodes badly for a bill he sent to congress this week that would give the state-owned utility CFE a commanding position in the power market.<br />It also could set up a confrontation between the court and the president, a nationalist who seeks to reverse key parts of a historic energy-sector overhaul carried out under his predecessor that ended Mexico’s state monopoly on the oil market and opened electricity markets to greater private investment.<br />Mexican courts are emerging as an obstacle to Mr. Lopez Obrador’s drive to centralize power, say analysts. A number of lower court decisions have gone against the government in the energy sector, and the Supreme Court had stopped the government from lowering the salaries of senior officials at autonomous institutions such as the central bank.<br />Wednesday’s ruling by a 4-1 vote knocks down key aspects of a policy published last year by the Energy Ministry that required the national power grid operator to take electricity generated by CFE before cheaper options from private generators that have invested billions of dollars in the country, especially in wind and solar stations. The ministry argued that the change was necessary to ensure network reliability.</td>

      <td>We still need price theory; among other things, it cautions us about utopian visions that pay no heed to economic reality.</td>
      <td>In “How Economics Lost Itself in Data” (op-ed, Jan. 28), Prof. Alexander William Salter argues that the current generation of economists have “serious theoretical blind spots” because they abandoned price theory in pursuit of data. It’s absolutely true that “data doesn’t interpret itself.” Equally true: Whoever chooses the data set can control the outcome.<br />All the more reason we still need price theory; among other things, it cautions us about utopian visions that pay no heed to economic reality. On the other hand, today’s economists—technocrats on the left with grand agendas—seek data of commensurate size. Big data enables big government; bigger data feeds bigger government and the more government grows, the more our liberty contracts. Or, as Mark Twain put it in his autobiography, “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.”<br />Roger H. Leemis<br />Southfield, Mich.<br /></td>

      <td>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tries to balance competing wings of GOP in post-Trump era</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—House Democrats said they would hold a vote Thursday to remove Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.) from her committees over her past incendiary remarks and social-media posts, ratcheting up pressure on House Republicans wrestling with whether to take disciplinary action.<br />The intensifying fight over the freshman lawmaker converged Wednesday with an effort to topple House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming after she voted to impeach former President Donald Trump. The two developments, set to be discussed at a House GOP meeting in the afternoon, highlighted the fierce infighting roiling the Republican Party as it seeks to define itself after Mr. Trump’s loss.<br />After weeks of withholding judgment, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) will be forced to make a decision Wednesday on whether to strip committee assignments from Mrs. Greene, a Trump loyalist who has been condemned on both sides of the aisle for embracing conspiracy theories. Democrats said the House will vote Thursday to remove her from the committees if Mr. McCarthy doesn’t act first.<br />At the same time, he will also referee an effort from some lawmakers to demote Ms. Cheney, the only member of GOP leadership to vote to impeach Mr. Trump last month on allegations that he incited the violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.<br />Mr. McCarthy ascended to power on his ability to forge strong relationships, including with Mr. Trump. His decisions Wednesday will almost certainly leave some faction of the House GOP unhappy and complicate his ambitions of becoming speaker if the GOP reclaims the House next year.</td>

      <td>Marble? Corian? Quartzite? We consulted interior designers to match countertop substances with personality types. Find yourself, and your next kitchen here.</td>
      <td>WE ASK A LOT of our kitchen countertops. We gather around them, work at them, prep food on them, eat on them—and these days we also seem to think our counters should say something about us. So, given the kaleidoscopic array of options on the market, how do you know which material suits you? In kitchen design as in all relationships it comes down to compatibility. Pride yourself on hard-nosed practicality? You’ll likely love clean, indestructible quartzite. Millennial fashionista? Terrazzo beckons. We asked a few of our favorite design experts to play matchmaker with a varied lineup of countertop materials, personalities and budgets. Here’s what shook out.<br />Want to avoid the hefty install costs that come with materials like marble? Tile countertops (from $10 a square foot) can be a smart workaround, said Beth Dotolo of Seattle-based Pulp Design Studios. But beware: Grout gets grimy fast. For a refined, durable look, opt for large-format tile that’s been rectified to avoid large grout lines. Houston designer Marie Flanigan, who just completed an island using 12-inch-by-24-inch reclaimed limestone tiles, concurred. “People think of those clunky 4-inch squares we grew up with,” she said, “but if you choose wisely, tile can get you the beauty of natural stone without the price tag of a slab.”<br />For a sleek, midcentury look, stainless steel countertops (from $55 a square foot) are New York kitchen-cabinetry designer Christopher Peacock’s choice. They require custom fabrication, so they’re not a budget option—but besides Machine Age good looks, they have a lot to recommend them. They’re germ-resistant, easy to clean and impervious to stains and rust.<br />When it’s perfectly seamless simplicity you’re after, man-made, “solid surface” workhorses like Corian (from $40 a square foot) are hard to beat, said Marianne Brown of Salt Lake City’s W Design Collective. “If I’m using Corian, I always stick to solid colors and straight lines, because decorative edges can definitely make it look dated,” she added. Another nifty trick? Match the color of your countertop to your cabinets for a sleek monochromatic effect.<br />Do even the tiniest blemishes make you hyperventilate? Quartzite counters (from $50 to over $200 a square foot) could be the answer. Slabs of it come in a range of hues, from brown to blue to bright white, and include all kinds of movement veining. “Quartzite is the most durable natural stone, harder than granite, so we use it all the time when a client needs something heat- and scratch-resistant and nearly indestructible,” said Ms. Flanigan.”</td>

Officials added Canada is believed to be the first jurisdiction to list the Proud Boys as a terrorist group.<br />“There is a growing body of evidence, collected here in Canada but also [by the U.S.], of an escalation of violence that the Proud Boys has been involved in,” said Public Safety Minister Bill Blair.<br />“This is not about politics,” he added, “and it is not about infringing upon the freedom of belief, association or speech. It is about controlling violent activities of ideologically-motivated extremism.”<br />Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, said the decision was unjustified and demonstrated heavy-handedness from Canada’s Liberal government.</td>

      <td>On the movie calendar pretzeled by the pandemic, February is the new December—the last month for movies to qualify for the Academy Awards. With the Oscars telecast pushed to its latest date ever (April 25), a normally sleepy month for new releases brings a cluster of films trying to slingshot into the big game.<br />Some of them are already in the running for other awards, including “Nomadland,” “The Father” and “Judas and the Black Messiah,” all nominated Wednesday for Golden Globe Awards. (That ceremony is scheduled for Feb. 28, more than a month later than usual.)<br />The February blitz has repercussions for everyday film fans, too. Instead of the typical incremental release starting “in select theaters,” most awards contenders are also dropping in living rooms around the same time for on-demand viewing. The hard part is keeping track of all the variations of when, where and how to see them.<br />Even for Hollywood, it’s been a challenge to monitor a playing field reshaped by theater closures and awards organizations responding to Covid.<br />“It’s been a long run of the award-type films, starting in late summer through now. From that standpoint, it sure feels like we’re still in 2020,” says Pam Williams, a producer of “The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” about the feds’ targeting of the jazz legend, played by Andra Day. Director Lee Daniels made it for the big screen, shooting it on film in 2019. But the plan for a theatrical release through Paramount Pictures changed when Hulu bought the film for an exclusive U.S. release.</td>

      <td>Strong cash flow from recovered ad business underwrites steep cloud losses</td>
      <td>The irony of Google shining more light on its cloud business is that the move proved just how much the internet giant still needs its advertising machine.<br />And what a machine it is. Parent company  Alphabet  Inc.’s  fourth-quarter results late Tuesday showed that advertising revenue surged 22% year over year to a record $46.2 billion. That was 9% higher than the already strong advertising recovery Wall Street had been expecting following an unprecedented dip in the first half of 2020, which was caused by the pandemic’s damage to major industries such as travel that are big Google ad buyers. The company said Tuesday that the recovery was fueled both by brand and direct-response advertising; YouTube advertising alone surged 46% year over year to about $6.9 billion.<br />Advertising turned out to be the bright light in a quarter that also included the company’s first disclosure of its cloud profits, or rather the lack thereof. Google Cloud grew 46% last year by generating nearly $13.1 billion in revenue. But it also lost $5.6 billion, and has run operating losses for the past three years. That may have been in line with previous signals from the company about the scale of its investment in the business, but it still took many by surprise. Michael Levine of Pivotal Research called the losses “fairly shocking” in a note to clients.  Amazon.com ’s  AWS division was generating about $3.4 billion a year in operating profit when at a similar revenue level.<br />But investors quickly got over the sticker shock. Alphabet’s stock price surged nearly 9% by Wednesday afternoon to a record. As it turns out, the company’s decision to break out Google Cloud as its own segment showcased just how strong its ad business is. Under the new reporting structure, the segment called Google Services that includes advertising showed an operating margin of 32% for 2020. That is 7 percentage points higher than the operating margin reported for the core Google business in 2019 when that core segment included both advertising and the cloud operations.<br />Analysts largely gave Google a pass on the steep cloud losses, projecting that the business will eventually scale to a healthy bottom line. The company itself noted that its backlog for the cloud business jumped to $30 billion by the end of the quarter compared with $19 billion just three months prior. And despite its reputation for big spending, Alphabet’s capital expenditures have actually declined for two years in a row now, leading to record free cash flow of $42.8 billion in 2020. Google may be playing an expensive game of catch-up in the cloud, but it at least has the means to run the race.</td>

      <td>Trimming hair at home—be it yours, your partner’s or your squirming child’s—can easily result in disaster. Here, expert advice on how to masterfully shear the whole family.</td>
      <td>THE SKILL that matters most when you’re attempting to cut your hair at home is not point-cutting—i.e., chipping into ends with the tip of the scissors while holding them vertically to create texture. It’s not beveling—i.e., rounding out the angles of a razor cut.<br />It’s restraint. When cuts go awry, it’s usually because people can’t resist trimming just a bit more or refuse to leave the hard-to-reach back of their heads alone, said Ana Costa, a hairstylist at Papillon Jaune Salon in Providence, R.I. But the odds of creating non-cringe-y results vastly increase if you equip yourself with the right tools: that is, ones you’re actually qualified to use. “Don’t buy anything that requires a license,” said Ms. Costa. Basic shearing scissors, a comb and clips will do. Don’t overcomplicate things, either. Work in sections, which is tedious but effective, and set realistic expectations (Vidal Sassoon didn’t master the bob before breakfast). Here, the best techniques to try on yourself, kids and partners for cuts that look sharp from all angles.<br />On yourself: Start with dry or damp hair so you have an accurate sense of the length and don’t inadvertently change the geometry of your cut. Just clean up the lines. If you have bangs, start by trimming them: Gather the bangs and twist them into a section above your nose. Snip into the ends, first straight across and then vertically to achieve soft edges. Don’t cut bangs beyond the outer edges of your eyebrows, said Ms. Costa. To banish split ends around your face, run your comb (Ms. Costa prefers Krest’s fine-tooth models, from $6, amazon.com) through your hair, stopping ½ inch from the bottom, and snip the frayed bits. If you insist on trimming the back of your mane solo, it’s possible, but only if your hair is longer than shoulder length. Part it in the middle and pull the sections forward so the tips lie flat on your chest. Point-cut up into the ends—this results in a symmetrical V-shape, said Amy Abramite, a hairstylist at Maxine Salon in Chicago.<br />On someone else:Arm yourself with sectioning clips (Ms. Costa’s favorites are Framar Gator Grip Clips, $9 for four, framar.com) so you clearly see the areas you need to cut (front, back, sides). Good lighting also helps, so sit your “client” near a window. Starting at the nape and moving forward, release a one-inch section and trim it to the desired length—this initial cut will serve as a guide to measure all others against. “I’d advise taking off no more than ½ inch at first,” said Ms. Costa. “You can always do more later.” To avoid a (literal) square haircut, snip the ends around the face on a slight angle, holding your comb at 45-degrees and cutting along it as a guide. To avoid conjuring a Picasso, pull pieces under the chin to ensure they’re even lengths. Adjust as needed.<br />On yourself: Grab a pair of scissors and a modest clipper: “Using scissors longer than 5 1/2 inches is like cutting hair with a sword,” said Ms. Abramite. For a simple, neatly shorn cut, start buzzing with the standard number-four guard, staying below the occipital bone (where your head starts to curve). Tackle the top section with scissors: Pull small, ½-inch sections between your pointer and middle fingers and slide the hair straight up, then notch into the ends with your scissors pointed down to remove bulk. Lastly, take off the guard and buzz carefully around the perimeter of your head and neck to tidy up any scruffy strands.</td>

Now voters may be unwilling to allow the first-term Democrat to continue as California’s governor. A new survey in the Golden State suggests that his November party in defiance of pandemic protocols at the acclaimed French Laundry restaurant was even more expensive than it seemed.<br />The elections of 2020 clarified that no one should expect political polls to express mathematical precision. But the recent trend is striking.

But now criticism of the governor isn’t just coming from people who prefer free markets. “Gavin Newsom Is Blowing It” reads a headline today in the leftist New Republic, which describes the surprisingly strong movement to recall Newsom from office. James Pogue writes:<br />Covid lockdowns have been brutal for those Californians who can’t afford to dine at a celebrated Napa eatery. The state’s unemployment rate is now more than two full percentage points higher than the national average.<br />The Berkeley poll doesn’t find that the reliably Democratic state is quite ready to fire Mr. Newsom.

State Assemblyman Phil Steck, an Albany-area Democrat who supports a stock-transfer tax, said any impact on individual investors would be minuscule compared with the positive effects of additional state spending on infrastructure.</td>

      <td>Like today, policy makers of the 1960s had bigger worries than prices. Then a spike crushed the economy.</td>
      <td>There is a long history of high budget deficits being associated with inflation, and Washington’s current profligate spending and the Federal Reserve’s expansive monetary policy may be pushing the U.S. down that path. In the U.S. and world-wide, the link between deficits and inflation has been most apparent during wartime, as the fiscal burdens of combat spur central banks into inflationary financing. But there are also peacetime instances. Now, after a decade of modest inflation that has made many expect it will always stay low, a rise in inflation may come as a surprise.<br />Sounding the alarm about inflation is out of vogue. Skeptics point out that high deficit spending, zero interest rates and unprecedented quantitative easing didn’t spur inflation in the decade after the 2008-09 financial crisis. That experience has left a strong impression on makers of monetary and fiscal policy.<br />But the government response to the pandemic is dwarfing the actions that followed the financial crisis. Fiscal initiatives since last March have already authorized deficit spending equal to 17% of gross domestic product. Generous government transfers to individuals and businesses have supported household incomes and will stimulate aggregate demand for years to come. President Biden now proposes additional deficit spending equal to roughly 9% of GDP. These total deficit increases are magnitudes larger than President Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.<br />Combined with the Fed’s expansive monetary policy, the government’s income supports have generated a surge in money supply and excess household savings. Even before the latest Treasury distribution of $600 checks, much less the new round of checks Mr. Biden proposes, personal savings were an estimated $1.5 trillion higher than pre-pandemic levels. That contrasts sharply with the Fed’s post-financial-crisis quantitative-easing programs, which only generated excess reserves that sloshed around between big banks and the Fed and were never put directly to work in the economy. The widespread administering of vaccines is now set to release the constraints of the pandemic and unleash the unprecedented pipeline of fiscal and monetary stimulus.<br />A few episodes from history stand out as parallels. After World War II, concerns that aggregate demand would slump and the economy would shrink led the Treasury to pressure the Fed to maintain its artificially low interest-rate pegs. Contrary to expectations, a surge of pent up household savings and massive Fed liquidity resulted in strong economic growth, and inflation—up to 15% a year by 1948.</td>

      <td>Lost amid President Trump’s unceremonious send-off were a pair of Jan. 14 tweets from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: Of the more than five million people identified as “Palestinian refugees” by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, fewer than 200,000 meet the criteria for refugee status.<br />This is a breach of trust by a U.N. agency, but Unrwa is not the only one to blame. One administration after another, Democrat and Republican, enabled Unrwa to perpetuate its fiction. It’s time for a new U.S. policy that promotes regional peace, advances Palestinian human rights and defends the U.S. taxpayer.<br />History can explain, in part, how this mess was created. In 1948, five Arab armies invaded the fledgling state of Israel but lost. Unrwa was established to care for Arab residents displaced by that conflict. The organization was dedicated solely to Palestinian Arabs—independent of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which took responsibility for all other world refugee populations.<br />Unrwa became part of a new Arab narrative: Millions of Palestinians were trapped as refugees, living in destitution and yearning for home. Until these people achieved their “right of return,” the Arab world insisted, the Middle East would never see peace. Meanwhile, Israel absorbed 800,000 Jewish refugees who were exiled from Arab states.<br />Over time, America somehow allowed itself to become Unrwa’s leading donor. From 1950 to 2018, American taxpayers contributed more than $6 billion, even as legislators from both parties raised concerns about the agency. Employees moonlighted as terrorists. Schools were used to store weapons and launch rockets against Israel. Concerns in Congress mounted over waste, fraud and abuse.</td>

      <td>Free trading has been a boon to online brokers, banks, investment advisers and fintech upstarts. But if frenzies like this keep up, it may prove to be costly, too.<br />A surge of activity in 2020 helped set trading-volume records for many brokers and collectively brought millions of new accounts, driven by a surprisingly buoyant market and the widespread adoption of commission-free trading. But this past week’s frenzy around  GameStop  and other stocks highlighted some potential downsides of this small-trader wave.<br />Moves by some trading platforms including Robinhood Markets to restrict some trading at times drew huge scrutiny from customers and politicians. Even shares of far bigger firms, such Charles Schwab, which now also owns TD Ameritrade, and  Morgan Stanley ,  which now owns E*Trade, were sold off sharply last week.<br />Those shares have rallied so far this week. But the question investors may be considering is whether a sustained explosion of trading is ultimately good for the online-trading business.<br />From a revenue standpoint, the absence of commissions and little return on customer cash due to superlow interest rates increases reliance on other revenue sources, like margin lending and payment-for-order flow. So called PFOF in particular, which involves sending customers’ trading orders to wholesale market-making firms, has drawn huge attention over the past week. Whether warranted or not, regulatory changes or customer demands that limit this revenue source could make volume much less valuable.</td>

Given this context, we believe they will be able to operate most effectively as independent entities,” Mr. Källenius said.</td>

Prosecutors said the men routed the funds through shell companies and a nonprofit.<br />On his final day in office last month, Mr. Trump pardoned Mr. Bannon as part of a flurry of pardons and commutations. The White House said Mr. Bannon “has been an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen.” That pardon applied only to alleged federal crimes, not state charges.<br />The investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., a Democrat, is in its early stages, the people said. It couldn’t be determined if Manhattan prosecutors were investigating the same circumstances that underpinned the federal investigation.<br />For local prosecutors to gain access to information presented to a federal grand jury, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York would have to request an order from a federal judge.

      <td>BLAME ILL-BEHAVED pooches (or their owners) and an absurd parade of “emotional support” chickens and “comfort” tarantulas. As of January 2021, the Department of Transportation (DOT) began cracking down, limiting the types of furry companions allowed to fly in airline cabins free of charge. There is now only one acceptable candidate: a service animal. A service animal is not a pet; it’s a dog, highly and specifically trained to aid an “individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability,” according to the DOT. Official documentation is required in advance of travel. Other pets can still fly in the cabin on most U.S. airlines—including Alaska Airlines and  JetBlue —but for a fee (in the $125 range, each way) and only if they fit in a carrier under the seat. Rules vary but that generally disqualifies all animals but those about 25 pounds or under. If Spot is a healthy, 70-pound Dalmatian, cargo is an option, and some airlines like Delta have stepped up, with climate-controlled hold areas for live animals, specially trained personnel and strict weather guidelines. But before you book (well in advance) and load him into a hard-sided crate, check with your vet.</td>

That’s the same time as last year and every year for the last decade.<br />The last time the Super Bowl wasn’t at 6:30 p.m. was in the distant time of 2010, before a radical shift brought it to its current slot. That year, the game was at 6:25 p.m., five minutes earlier than 6:30 p.m. In 2009, it was at 6 p.m. In 2008, it was at 6:17 p.m. On four occasions, it was even at 6:18 p.m. The NFL has dabbled in much experimentation during the six o’clock hour before finding the comfort of 6:30 p.m.<br />There are, however, some things about the big game that vary from year to year. That’s especially true in 2021 for an event that will look like never before with the country in the throes of a global pandemic. So here’s your quick guide to everything about the 55th Super Bowl, otherwise known as Super Bowl LV.<br />The Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. That’s especially exciting because of the teams’ two quarterbacks: Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady—the last two to win the Super Bowl.<br />Mahomes led the Chiefs to last year’s title. Brady has won six and this will be his 10th Super Bowl appearance. But the previous nine came with the New England Patriots, the team he left after last season. It’s a generational battle between the 43-year-old Brady and the 25-year-old Mahomes. One is toward the end of an all-time career. The other is at the beginning of one.</td>

      <td>In survey of almost 10,000 respondents, many small companies said continued government aid is key to their survival</td>
      <td>America’s small businesses remain under stress from coronavirus pandemic disruptions, and many of them say continued government support is crucial to their survival, according to a new report from the Federal Reserve’s 12 regional banks released on Wednesday.<br />Just under 90% of companies surveyed by the Fed banks said business had not returned to pre-pandemic levels almost a year after the crisis began. Of those that lost ground, 30% said that without more government aid, their companies might not survive, the report said.<br />The survey, an annual project that tallied nearly 10,000 respondents from firms with 500 or fewer employees, found that almost all small firms reported some negative impact from the pandemic, with 78% reporting a drop in income and just under half cutting their workforce in response to reduced demand. Just over half of the firms said revenue for last year is likely to have fallen by more than 25%. The survey was carried out in October and November.<br />The Fed noted in the report that while it surveyed conditions among small businesses, it is those businesses that represent 99.7% of all employers. The report arrives as the Biden administration and Congress are debating another round of economic stimulus to help the economy navigate and escape the effects of the pandemic, which has had a withering impact on business and hiring, both in the United States and in other nations.<br />The Fed is itself providing significant support via ultra low rates and bond-buying efforts aimed at keeping the cost of credit low. Emergency lending programs offered by the Fed, which in many cases saw relatively light usage, have been curtailed. The Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, however, has been relaunched.</td>

He will also be able to help his successor, Andy Jassy, who has run the company’s booming cloud-computing business, learn and grow in the CEO role, said Peter Crist, chairman of executive recruitment firm Crist Kolder Associates. Amazon said Tuesday that Mr. Bezos would transition out of the CEO seat in the third quarter.<br />Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, told analysts Tuesday that Mr. Bezos would remain involved in what Amazon terms “one-way door” issues—the big, irreversible decisions, such as acquisitions or getting into the grocery business, that can’t be easily undone once they are initiated.<br />“Jeff’s always been involved with that, and that’s where we’ll keep his time focused on,” Mr. Olsavsky said.</td>

Talks between the two companies are continuing, though a deal isn’t imminent, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Such stock run-ups historically have been uncommon for SPACs, and even after they announce merger targets, their shares rarely jump so significantly. That is because the SPACs are paying what they believe to be a market price for the company they are merging with, so in theory, the shares shouldn’t surge unless they are undervaluing their target company.</td>

      <td>Tanzania’s government said it had no interest in accessing Covid-19 vaccines, cementing its status as an outlier in the world’s fight against the pandemic, as most other African countries scrambled to secure shots.<br />Tanzanian President John Magufuli has rejected lockdowns and other social-distancing measures and instead urged the country’s 60 million citizens to pray in churches and mosques against a “satanic” virus. In May, when it had confirmed 509 Covid-19 infections and 21 deaths, the government stopped reporting cases to the World Health Organization, after Mr. Magufuli insisted that Tanzania had conquered the pandemic and that test kits showing positive results were faulty.<br />This week, Tanzanian Health Minister Dorothy Gwajima said the country had no intention of importing Covid-19 vaccines, including free doses it could get from the global Covax initiative, which aims to supply shots to poor and middle-income countries.<br />“We are not yet satisfied that those vaccines have been clinically proven safe,” Dr. Gwajima said at a news conference, flanked by unmasked government health officials.<br />The only other African countries that have opted to forgo the free Covax vaccines are Burundi, Eritrea and the island state of Madagascar, according to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which manages the initiative along with the WHO. Other early Covid-19 deniers, such as Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko—who last spring called the coronavirus a “psychosis” that could be fought with vodka, saunas and driving tractors—have since accepted vaccines.</td>

      <td>Jack Grundhofer, who has died at age 82, built U.S. Bancorp into a giant and took heat for slashing costs</td>
      <td>Early in Jack Grundhofer’s 40-year banking career, someone shot a gun at him while he was repossessing a car in Southern California. Later, a kidnapper tied him to a tree in Wisconsin. When he was eliminating jobs at Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. in the early 1990s, newspapers dubbed him “Jack the Ripper.”<br />Mr. Grundhofer, who grew up poor as the son of a bartender in Glendale, Calif., wasn’t easily intimidated. Through a long series of acquisitions, he created what became today’s U.S. Bancorp., the nation’s fifth-largest banking company in terms of assets.<br />He learned early in his career to clamp down on costs. “I’ll do whatever I have to do, however Draconian,” he told The Wall Street Journal in 1993. “Shareholders are looking for someone to protect their livelihood. You have to manage tough to survive.”<br />Mr. Grundhofer died Jan. 24 at his home in Indian Wells, Calif. He was 82. The cause of death was pneumonia, unrelated to Covid-19, his wife, Patti Grundhofer, said.<br />Soon after arriving as the new chief executive at First Bank in 1990, Mr. Grundhofer began eliminating about 20% of the workforce. Stung by criticism of his swift job cuts, he said in a letter to the Journal that he didn’t enjoy firing people. “If we had not been successful in making the tough choices to turn around this company,” he added, “there easily could have been 10,000 people out of work, instead of 2,000.”</td>

      <td>Betting companies, personal care and new stadiums in Los Angeles and Las Vegas drove a 10% increase in sponsorships despite the pandemic</td>
      <td>National Football League teams suffered outbreaks and postponements during the 2020 season, but one thing seemed immune to the coronavirus: the allure of the NFL brand.<br />Sponsors at the league, team and venue level committed a total of $1.62 billion to the NFL during the 2020-21 season that ends with Sunday’s Super Bowl, according to sponsorship consultancy IEG. That amount led the four major North American sports leagues and represented a 10% increase from the previous year, roughly twice the NFL’s typical year-over-year sponsorship growth.<br />The extra growth was driven largely by $55 million in new spending for the naming rights of Las Vegas’s Allegiant Stadium and Los Angeles’s SoFi Stadium. But the NFL and its teams also saw their usual array of sponsors expand to include betting and teeth-straightening companies.<br />“One of the things that sort of prevents disruption is stability,” said Peter Laatz, global managing director at IEG. “And the NFL has always been a model of stability.”<br />The NFL’s sponsorship bump, however, isn’t yet money in the bank. Some sponsors are trying to claw back some cash or stretch out their deals, mainly because of in-stadium crowd restrictions and other Covid-related drags on the value of sponsorships, Laatz said. Most of the brands IEG has spoken with are extending the length of their deals without adding extra payment, he said.</td>

      <td>Company is set to sell Planters to Hormel following years of neglect</td>
      <td>Kraft Heinz is close to fetching a very attractive price for its Planters business. Next, it must use the proceeds wisely.<br />The company might reach a deal to sell the business to  Hormel Foods  as soon as next week for around $3 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.<br />At first glance the nuts category is an attractive one, fitting the contemporary trend toward healthier, protein-based snacks. But it also lends itself to competition and commoditization: private-label brands hold about a one-third share, according to Barclays analyst Andrew Lazar.<br />Compounding the problem has been years of underinvestment in the brand under Kraft Heinz’s old mantra of cost-cutting above all. This left Planters largely confined to plain canned peanuts, while competitors invested in products such as flavored almonds marketed as an alternative to chips. Wells Fargo analyst John Baumgartner estimates that Planters’ market share fell around 7 percentage points to 18% between 2016 and 2019.<br />It appears to be a natural fit for Hormel’s protein-focused portfolio of meats and nut butters, but it might be overpaying. At $3 billion, Planters would be going for around three times 2019 sales, according to Wells Fargo’s Mr. Baumgartner. That would be a similar valuation to  Campbell Soup ’s  acquisition of organic soup brand Pacific Foods in 2017 and  Danone ’s  2016 deal for organic specialist WhiteWave Foods, maker of the Horizon organic milk brand, Mr. Baumgartner notes. But those are both more premium categories with better growth potential.</td>

      <td>Business of providing remote computer services represents about 10% of Amazon’s sales but produced its next leader</td>
      <td>The elevation of Andy Jassy to become  Amazon.com Inc.’s  next chief executive of is one of the clearest signs yet that fortunes in the tech industry are increasingly made in the cloud.<br />Mr. Jassy was instrumental in helping to transform the online retailing giant he joined in 1997 into a juggernaut in cloud-computing, the business of renting servers and software to customers largely on a pay-as-you-go model. It is a market that could top $300 billion globally this year, according to research firm  Gartner Inc.,  and pits Amazon against tech giants like  Microsoft Corp.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google.<br />The battle for the cloud is playing out across industries—from videogames and cars to space—and companies large and small.<br />For Amazon, cloud computing has been a booming business that is massively lucrative. Amazon Web Services, or AWS,  generated little more than 10% of Amazon’s total sales in the final quarter of last year but yielded more than half the company’s operating profit in the period. AWS revenue advanced 28% over those three months from the previous year to $12.7 billion, and its operating profit was $3.6 billion.<br />For executives, the cloud is increasingly becoming a stepping-stone at tech companies. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ran the software giant’s cloud business before being elevated to the top job in 2014.  International Business Machines Corp.  last year turned to its cloud chief when it came to naming a new CEO to help revive growth.</td>

      <td>Female filmmakers emerged as a force among this year’s Golden Globe nominees, with women occupying three of the five slots for best director.</td>
      <td>Streaming services again dominated a Hollywood awards season, with the line between films and TV shows blurring for viewers craving entertainment at home as the pandemic kept many cinemas closed.<br />Wednesday morning’s Golden Globe nominations included 42 nods for  Netflix  across film and television, though if last year’s nominations are any guide, that is no guarantee of major wins. Two of the five best motion-picture drama nominees this year were Netflix films: “Mank,” a black-and-white love letter to old Hollywood and “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” about the defendants charged with conspiracy after 1968 protests.<br />Nominations for best motion-picture direction went to three women for the first time, including debut feature filmmakers Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”) and Regina King (“One Night in Miami”), along with director Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”). It was a departure from last year, when the Globes were slammed for snubbing women in that high-profile category.<br />Favorites like Chadwick Boseman earned much expected recognition. Mr. Boseman is in contention for best actor in a movie drama for “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” which includes a scene where his character rails against the idea of a merciful God. It would be a posthumous win for the actor, whose death after a private battle with cancer shocked fans last summer.<br />On the TV side, new shows that doubled as pandemic binge fare like “Ted Lasso,” “Lovecraft Country” and “The Flight Attendant,” along with crowd pleasers “The Crown,” “Schitt’s Creek” and “Ozark” from pre-Covid days, emerged as strong contenders by the famously quirky Hollywood Foreign Press Association, whose roughly 90 members do the voting.</td>
