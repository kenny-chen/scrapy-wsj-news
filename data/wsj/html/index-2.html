      <td>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has suspended the onboarding process for several last-minute Trump administration nominees to Pentagon advisory boards, defense officials said, effectively preventing them from being seated.<br />Among those affected are Corey Lewandowski, former President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign manager, and David Bossie, a former Trump deputy campaign manager.<br />In December, then-Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller named them to the Defense Business Board, an unpaid group which is intended to provide the defense secretary and other leaders with private-sector advice on business practices.<br />They were among dozens of Trump appointees to government boards in the final weeks of the former president’s term, including the business board, the Defense Policy Board and others. Messrs. Lewandowski and Bossie didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />Mr. Austin’s directive applied to Trump nominees who were still in the process of seeking security clearances and being seated. Other nominees already had completed the onboarding process and had joined their advisory panels. Defense officials couldn’t say how many nominees were affected by Mr. Austin’s directive, which applied to at least five boards and which was first reported by Politico.</td>

Taylor, 60 years old, and his son Peter M. Taylor, 27, have been in a Boston-area jail since May, battling a federal government effort to extradite them to Japan. Authorities there want to charge them with crimes allegedly committed when they helped Mr. Ghosn flee that country in late 2019, hidden inside a musical-equipment box.<br />Late Thursday, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani rejected the Taylors’ emergency petition to halt the extradition ordered by the State Department. The Taylors argued, among other things, that they would be likely to face torture and unjust treatment in Japan.<br />“Although the prison conditions in Japan may be deplorable and although the criminal procedures that the Taylors may be subjected to may not satisfy American notions of due process, those allegations do not constitute the ‘severe physical or mental pain or suffering’ ” contemplated in regulations governing extradition matters, Judge Talwani ruled.<br />The Taylors’ attorneys immediately filed a motion that they would appeal the ruling, court documents show. The attorneys didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</td>

      <td>This isn’t 2009.</td>
      <td>President Joe Biden is still claiming there’s an economic crisis to justify  trillions of dollars in new federal spending. But it’s getting harder to make the case. On Thursday the Commerce Department reported that real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 4% in the fourth quarter of 2020. This follows the historic 33.4% surge in the third quarter and demonstrates a remarkable rebound from the spring shutdowns wherever state governors have been willing to allow it.<br />Nationwide, the last three months of 2020 featured a robust 13.8% increase in business investment, including a sizzling 24.9% surge in equipment purchases.<br />Overall, the solid 4% real GDP growth is a welcome and unfortunately rare event. The last two quarters were the first to reach or exceed such a pace during the Trump presidency. Of the 31 complete quarters during the Obama presidency, only four matched or exceeded this rate. The United States has just enjoyed the best final full quarter of a presidency since George H. W. Bush presided over a 4.2% surge in the final months of 1992.<br />By any reasonable measure, the economy is not in need of a “rescue.” So in a spirit of unity, how can sensible Democrats explain to President Joe Biden that his spending plans may be unnecessary, irrelevant to the issues at hand and dangerous for an economy in which federal debt now exceeds GDP?<br />On the first point, President Barack Obama’s chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Jason Furmanpolitely dropped a hint in these pages recently. Mr. Furman noted that the economy might not actually need every nickel of the tax dollars that Mr. Biden aims to spend:</td>

Sales growth by that measure moderated somewhat from earlier in the pandemic, especially in North America.<br />Shares fell 1% to $56.50 Thursday afternoon.

The company said it has also benefited from delivering its snacks directly to stores, rather than to warehouses or third-party distributors.</td>

      <td>A social-media stock bubble is a new version of an old phenomenon.</td>
      <td>The  GameStop  stock mania has captivated market speculators, spectators, politicians and even morning TV. It’s certainly high financial drama to see armies of retail investors on Reddit hunting the so-called wolves of Wall Street. This may be a new example of the power of social media, but it isn’t a crisis of capitalism or the stock market.<br />There are two broad theories of how equity markets work. One is to focus on fundamentals like the growth path of the U.S. economy and the prospects and earnings of companies. You buy and hold a stock, or you invest in a fund that tracks an index like the S&P 500 or Russell 2000. This is what most people do.<br />Yet we market fundamentalists have to admit that more than a few people have become very rich betting on the famous phrase “popular delusions and the madness of crowds.” Stock manias are common—and wonderful until they become panics. This is where we seem to be this week as investors used online brokerage platforms like Robinhood Markets to bid up shares in companies hyped on social media that may or may not deserve their soaring market capitalization.<br />The drama was heightened as the Reddit pack pumped up stocks like GameStop and the movie-theater company AMC that were shorted by hedge funds. Most are hoping to make a quick buck by riding the roller-coaster up and selling before shares crash, though some also want to squeeze the hedgies.<br />Short sellers have to deliver real shares when their short contracts expire, which means buying shares and raising the price even more. The losses can be high. Some in the Reddit pack triumphed this week when Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management had to rescue Melvin Capital Management from its short bet against GameStop. Hedge funds are sophisticated investors and know the risks.</td>

      <td>Until the San Francisco Unified School District board stripped Dianne Feinstein’s name from one of its public schools, we were unaware of the Senator’s service to the Confederacy. While the city’s mayor, she had replaced a vandalized Confederate flag that was part of a historical display outside City Hall. So now it’s goodbye to Dianne Feinstein Elementary School.<br />The Feinstein purge is among the banishments the board took Tuesday night when it voted 6-1 to rename 44 schools. The most absurd target is Abraham Lincoln, who waged the war that ended slavery. Also canceled were George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Daniel Webster and Paul Revere.<br />The criteria used to come up with the list of villains is whether they had promoted slavery, genocide, the oppression of women or “otherwise significantly diminished the opportunities of those amongst us to the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”<br />But a name on a school is not a declaration of perfection. And a society that rummages through history to hold those of the past to the woke standards of today will soon have no heroes to honor.<br />In a statement, Mayor London Breed said that while the naming of city schools is a conversation worth having, she cannot understand “why the School Board is advancing a plan to have all these schools renamed by April, when there isn’t a plan to have our kids back in the classroom.”</td>

      <td>Biden inherits a decent recovery that should surge as the pandemic eases.</td>
      <td>You know political spin is at work when the economy grows by 4% in the fourth quarter but the headlines are that growth fell for the entire pandemic year. Everyone already knows the economy fell off the cliff in the first half of 2020. The news is that the economic recovery is continuing despite the winter Covid surge.<br />That’s the real story from Thursday’s GDP report, which showed a remarkably resilient economy amid the worst of the pandemic. The 4% growth followed a rebound of 33.4% in the third quarter. The economy shrank by 3.5% for all of 2020. But nominal GDP in the fourth quarter rose to $21.48 trillion, which is nearly back to the peak of $21.75 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2019.<br />The depression many feared in the spring, not without cause, was averted. The economy entered 2021 with decent momentum and is poised to expand rapidly this year as the vaccine rollout proceeds and states like Michigan, New York and California end their punitive lockdowns on business. Is it merely a coincidence that these lockdowns are easing now that Joe Biden is President?<br />The details of the GDP report underscore the case for optimism. Private business investment provided most of the growth with a 25.3% surge. Residential construction rose 33.5% as the housing boom continues, but investment in equipment was also up 25%. The latter fits with the buoyant manufacturing indexes that suggest business optimism about orders and future demand.<br />Consumer spending increased by a meager 2.5% in the quarter after a 41% surge in the third quarter, which was expected given the lockdowns and voluntary social distancing. Spending on food and accommodations took a big hit from the decline in restaurant dining and travel. But unlike the spring, health care spending increased as politicians didn’t shut down elective surgery and cancer screenings.</td>

      <td>BOGOTÁ, Colombia—A special tribunal system set up in Colombia to process war atrocities has accused eight former rebel commanders of war crimes and crimes against humanity for the guerrillas’ practice of kidnapping people during the country’s decadeslong civil conflict.<br />The decision Thursday by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace, a system of judges and investigators who have a mandate to determine responsibility for war-related crimes, is a first against rebels of the now-defunct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, since the group signed a peace accord with the government in 2016.<br />Conflict researchers, victims and former peace negotiators said the accusations are a signal to critics, who assert that rebels benefited from the peace process without fear of punishment, that the justice system set up by the accord is functioning.<br />“This is very important, a crucial step for the court. It’s a sign that they are moving past impunity,” said Jorge Restrepo, director of the Conflict Analysis Resource Center, a Bogotá -based research group. “Never before had we been able to achieve an accusation like this against the guerrillas.”<br />Judge Julieta Lemaitre accused the former FARC leaders, two of whom are now in congress, of not only kidnapping but also murder, torture, sexual violence and forced displacement during Colombia’s conflict, which cost more than 200,000 lives and displaced millions. The Marxist group had long used kidnappings of civilians, including Americans, and extortion to finance its war to topple the Colombian state.</td>

      <td>Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio isn’t running for re-election in 2022. This is not good. He is a rightly respected figure. He tries to advance serious legislation. He doesn’t spend all his time talking on television.<br />He cheerily returned my call Wednesday from “the beautiful Russell Office Building.” He thinks his office was once that of Sen. Harry Truman; his previous office had been occupied by Truman’s frequent antagonist, Ohio’s Sen. Robert Taft. Mr. Portman finds this satisfying. In 11 years in the Senate, he has been known for a bipartisan approach.<br />Before being elected to the Senate in 2010 (by 18 points) and 2016 (by 21), Mr. Portman had six terms in the House and stints as director of the Office of Management and Budget and U.S. trade representative, both under President George W. Bush. He’s dexterously made his way through the party’s Trumpian minefields. Over the years when national events have turned especially murky, I’ve asked his read on things, and what’s always struck me is his stubborn sense of reality: He doesn’t let his wishes get in the way of what he sees. In the geography of the Republican Party he’d be placed with figures like Mitch Daniels—the We Actually Know Things Caucus.<br />When he made his announcement Monday, he said the Senate is too polarized, common ground has been lost. He has been moved by the response: “It’s a crazy world right now, and this decision I made I thought normal, but the response was abnormal. I think people are really yearning for some renewed bipartisanship and cooperation.” Potential candidates for his seat have called to say they want to be like him. “It’s been crazy,” he laughs, “like dying a good death.”<br />He’s 65 and means it when he says he wants more time with his family: “I never expected to be a career politician.” He intends to make progress “on the outside” on issues he cares about—drug addiction, sex trafficking, a commission on mandatory federal spending.</td>

The acquittal of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh—mastermind of the Pearl kidnapping—against U.S. advice is likely to attract renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s terrorist links.<br />It could also jeopardize Pakistan’s efforts to get off the United Nations “gray list” of countries with inadequate controls over terrorism financing.<br />Mr. Sheikh is an unrepentant jihadist terrorist who lured Mr. Pearl on the pretext of an interview and handed him over to al Qaeda associates. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, mastermind of 9/11, bragged about beheading the reporter during a hearing before a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay.<br />Mr. Mohammed’s boast became grounds for Mr. Sheikh’s appeal in the Pakistani courts. But while Mr. Mohammed may have wielded the sword that killed Mr. Pearl, Mr. Sheikh played the key role in the terrorist kidnapping and brutal murder.</td>

      <td>Long-term Treasurys could give Biden the room to spend big.</td>
      <td>Will Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen support issuing 50-year Treasury bonds? At her confirmation hearing, she told senators she wouldn’t rule it out. The idea deserves serious consideration. As the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product soars above 100%, buoyed by borrowing to pay for Covid-19 relief and ballooning entitlement payouts, Washington could use intelligent ways to finance the debt by taking advantage of low interest rates.<br />Extending the average maturity of Treasury debt to lock in low rates for longer periods through the issuance of 50-year Treasurys makes a lot of sense. Other countries—including Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Ireland, Israel and South Korea—have issued 100-year bonds. So have corporations such as  Disney  and  Coca-Cola .<br />If Washington is going to do it, now is the time. Some 100-year bonds have slightly higher rates (between 1 and 2 percentage points above comparable 10-year bond yields) and similar bid-ask spreads (a proxy for liquidity) compared with the 10-year bonds of comparable issuers. Some, including chief analyst with Dankse Bank Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, have argued that the U.S. Treasury could currently issue 50-year bonds at around the same yield as 30-year bonds at around 2%. But there’s a serious risk rates could skyrocket in the future. Imagine what would happen if inflation takes off or the U.S. runs into solvency issues with its massive and growing debt. The Treasury could look back at this time wistfully, wishing it’d locked in low interest rates—and significant savings—when it had the chance.<br />The Trump administration tried to issue 50- and 100-year bonds but got pushback from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a group of representatives from asset managers and Wall Street banks who advise the Treasury. The committee argued there wouldn’t be enough demand.<br />But its analysis missed how many long-term Treasurys could be bought up by defined-benefit pension funds looking for assets that match the duration (interest-rate risk) of their liabilities (payouts to pensioners in the future). While historically the duration of a typical pension scheme is around 20 years and tends to fall in the range of 15 to 25 years, many young pension funds pay out after more than 30 years.</td>

Her presentation on the need for cleaner care facilities, published in 1858, led to reforms that ultimately saved millions of lives and increased life expectancy in the U.K. Florence Nightingale, it turns out, was a pioneering data scientist.<br />Data, when used to reveal the value of hospital hygiene or the harm of tobacco smoke, can be a vital force for good, as Tim Harford reminds us in “The Data Detective.” But the very power of statistics—the “unreasonable effectiveness of data,” as three Google scientists put it—has also prompted a backlash, particularly as we’ve become aware of the potential for both honest confusion and deliberate abuse.<br />Mr. Harford, a British economist and journalist, hopes to persuade us not to give up on data, urging us to embrace thoughtful skepticism and avoid easy cynicism. As he expertly guides us through the many ways in which data can trick us, we see how difficult such an effort can be.<br />Imprecise and inconsistent definitions are one source of confusion. Our assessment of measures such as “inequality” can differ dramatically based on how such terms are defined. Even “infant mortality,” a key data point for public health, varies depending on the specific time in fetal development when the line is drawn between a miscarriage and a tragically premature birth.<br />Understanding data in context is also vital, Mr. Harford explains. British newspapers, fretting about gang violence, announced in 2018 that London’s monthly murder rate had exceeded New York’s. Yet open the aperture slightly and it turns out that the rates in both cities had declined over time and had reached a roughly similar low level—good news, but apparently a less dramatic headline or perspective.</td>

      <td>Will he build on Trump’s legacy or discard it? Early signs are discouraging.</td>
      <td>In the closing hours of the Trump administration, the State Department declared that the Chinese Communist Party’s actions against Muslim Uighurs and other minority groups constitute genocide. Those actions, according to then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, include “the arbitrary imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty of more than one million civilians, forced sterilization, torture of a large number of those arbitrarily detained, forced labor, and the imposition of draconian restrictions on freedom of religion or belief.”<br />The declaration came late but was consistent with the administration’s commendable approach to religious liberty. From creating an International Religious Freedom Alliance to signing executive orders that promote religious liberty and freedom of conscience, the Trump administration elevated these issues at home and abroad like no other. President Biden would do well to build on his predecessor’s legacy.<br />The Trump White House went far beyond words. In 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations providing conscience exceptions to ObamaCare’s contraception mandate. A July 2020 Supreme Court ruling upholding those regulations should end the decadelong persecution of the Little Sisters of the Poor for failing to provide abortifacient drugs.<br />In other cases, too, Mr. Trump’s judicial nominees have shown strong support for religious liberty, which will help ensure his administration’s legacy endures. In November, Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined a 5-4 majority to strike down arbitrary restrictions on worship imposed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. That order, which the court followed with other actions striking down Covid-related restrictions on worship, re-established the principle—abandoned earlier in the year—that “even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten.”<br />The Framers made religion the first freedom in the Bill of Rights for a reason. They recognized that from ancient times, autocratic rulers have used religion to oppress not just individuals’ actions, but their very thoughts and beliefs. When Thomas Jefferson wrote to Benjamin Rush that “I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man,” he referred specifically to the freedom of religion established in the First Amendment.</td>

      <td>Manchin and Sinema have to do more if they’re serious about saving the filibuster.</td>
      <td>A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. And rule-breaking by any other name is still rule-breaking. Which is why Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona still have a big question to answer.<br />The two Democrats made headlines this week when they said they would not vote to kill the legislative filibuster. Those declarations seem to put paid to liberal Democrats’ plans to blow up that longtime Senate rule requiring 60 votes to pass most bills. Mr. Manchin went out of his way to assure that there were no caveats. “I will not vote to bust the filibuster under any condition, on anything that you can think of,” he told the Washington Post. Ms. Sinema likewise reassured that she is “not open to changing her mind.”<br />Progressive are fuming, even as the declarations had the effect of immediately helping Democrats and President Biden’s early agenda. It reassured Minority Leader Mitch McConnell enough to agree to an organizing resolution that puts Democrats in control of evenly divided Senate committees.<br />Yet it turns out that the promise is, for now, only half a loaf. The Senate in fact has two guards against allowing a bare majority to jam through sweeping policy changes. One is the legislative filibuster. The other is what’s known as the Byrd rule—named after the senator whose seat Mr. Manchin now holds.<br />The Senate has a process called budget reconciliation, which allows certain spending and tax measures to pass the chamber with a simple majority. Sen. Robert C. Byrd, who died in 2010, was a defender of the chamber’s “deliberative process” and in 1985 moved to stop senators who were abusing reconciliation by jamming nonbudget issues into those bills simply to avoid the 60-vote requirement. The Senate unanimously adopted his rule, which essentially puts the Senate parliamentarian in charge of deciding whether items in reconciliation bills are truly budget-related. The Byrd rule protects against the majority using reconciliation as an end run around the legislative filibuster.</td>

      <td>The video-sharing app has spurred an unlikely revival of 19th-century sailors’ songs</td>
      <td>When future historians look back on the early weeks of 2021, they may be left scratching their heads at one seemingly inexplicable cultural trend: the revival of sea shanties.<br />“Shanties,” traditionally speaking, are songs sung by sailors to the rhythm of their work aboard merchant ships. But nowadays you’ll find them sung by all manner of people on the video-sharing app TikTok, where the nautical tunes have become such an unlikely viral phenomenon that they’ve inspired the hashtag #ShantyTok.<br />It all started in late December, when a Scottish postal worker named Nathan Evans uploaded his rendition of an old whaling song from New Zealand, “Soon May the Wellerman Come.” Using TikTok’s duet feature, others joined in with Mr. Evans, adding vocals and instrumental accompaniment. Since then, videos with the #seashanty tag have racked up more than three billion views, and online searches for “sea shanties” have skyrocketed, according to Google Trends.<br />Historically, “shanty” has been spelled as “chanty” or “chantey,” going back to its earliest appearances in print in the mid-19th century. Those spellings suggest a connection to the French word “chanter” meaning “to sing,” or more specifically the imperative form of the verb, “chantez.” The “shanty” spelling may have been influenced by a homonym referring to a crudely built wooden shelter (etymologically unrelated to the other “shanty,” though also with roots in French).<br />In an 1856 memoir, the journalist Charles Nordhoff recounted how as a young man he observed work gangs of largely English and Irish sailors in Mobile Bay, off the coast of Alabama, moving cotton bales into the holds of ships. The workers maintained their rhythm with “songs, rough and uncouth”: “The foreman is the chanty-man, who sings the song, the gang only joining in the chorus.”</td>

      <td>Now that Congress has simplified the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (Fafsa) and additional states consider completion of the Fafsa as a high-school graduation requirement (“States Mandating Student-Aid Forms,” U.S. News, Jan. 23), both moves will contribute to more lower-income students enrolling and completing college due to increased access to financial aid. I propose a third step: All students applying to college, whether applying for financial aid or not, should be required to submit the Fafsa and all colleges required to report those data to the U.S. Department of Education. We would then know the income distribution of students across institutions.<br />If we want higher education to act as an engine of economic and social mobility, we need to know if colleges are enrolling a socioeconomically diverse student body. Some may argue that this isn’t fair to families who are not applying for or receiving financial aid, but all students receive a subsidy above and beyond their tuition payments—even if they pay the full sticker price. Policy makers have the right to expect certain outcomes in exchange for federal and state financial support, and contributing to equal opportunity and economic mobility are stated objectives of that support. This change would allow policy makers to understand what they are getting for their money and hold institutions more accountable for serving the public good.<br />Catharine B.

      <td>Regarding Mark A. Izeman’s Jan. 22 letter in support of blocking the proposed New Jersey liquefied natural gas (LNG) port: His argument falls flat in terms of the true risks of LNG. LNG in its liquid state is nontoxic, noncorrosive, nonflammable and isn’t explosive. His claim that LNG is “potentially explosive” is a stretch, at best. Only when the vapors of LNG are ignited in a closed space does it become flammable. Marine cargo insurance for LNG shipments are approximately 25% less than that of crude oil, due to the lower risk profile. Over the past 50 years, over 100,000 LNG shipments have been made globally, without any major safety incidents reported.<br />From an environmental standpoint, Mr. Izeman’s argument about the impact on water pollution simply doesn’t hold water (no pun intended). When LNG spills onto a land or water surface, it vaporizes, disperses and leaves no residue.<br />It’s no surprise that the Natural Resources Defense Council would be opposed to any form of fossil fuel, but claiming that LNG poses an unreasonable safety risk is wrong—nothing could be further from the truth.<br />Prof. Jon Sorensen (logistics)<br />Lone Star College</td>

      <td>An HBO documentary looks under the hood at the life of Elizabeth Carmichael, a transgender woman who launched a fraudulent auto company.</td>
      <td>If the four-part documentary “The Lady and the Dale” were someone you met at a post-pandemic cocktail party, it would be sidling up and saying, “Want to hear a crazy story?” It seems that during the gas shortage of the 1970s there was a woman, see, who came out with a three-wheeled car that got 70 miles to the gallon—it was such a big deal they gave one away on “The Price Is Right.” Of course, the car wasn’t all it appeared to be. For that matter, neither was the woman.<br />Directed by Nick Cammilleri and Zackary Drucker, “The Lady and the Dale” is a lot of stories—about fraud, flight, FBI manhunts, transgender politics, selective prosecution, bias in the media and corruption in the courts. If it were a car, episode 1 would barely be opening the hood. Always in the driver’s seat, however, is G. Elizabeth Carmichael, entrepreneur, who was born Jerry Dean Michael, future career criminal. From kiting checks to counterfeiting U.S. currency, her life as Michael indicated a personality constitutionally incapable of legitimate enterprise. As Carmichael the stakes were higher and the goals more ambitious, but the illicit nature of her efforts was consistent. The series—new episodes of which appear on consecutive Sundays—quite smartly questions why a highly intelligent transgender woman would choose a life of crimes both high and low. It just as smartly answers its own question: When society casts you in the role of outlaw, that just might be how you choose to perform.<br />The Dale, which occupies some but certainly not all of the narrative in “The Lady and the Dale,” was the creation of engineer Dale Clifft, who attached the rear end of a motorcycle with a two-stroke engine to a plastic housing with two front wheels—mostly, he said, so he could ride in the rain. Carmichael saw it as the answer to the OPEC-inflicted gas crisis of 1973 and the instant popularity of smaller, more fuel-efficient automobiles. Evidently brilliant, and audacious, Carmichael didn’t concern herself with the messy details of car manufacturing—or the illegalities involved in collecting deposits on cars never to be built. This led to a sensational nine-month jury trial in Los Angeles in 1976-77. But the series involves much more, and saying almost anything about “The Lady and the Dale” seems like a spoiler, especially as laid out by Mr. Cammilleri, a documentarian, and Ms. Drucker, a transgender artist and LGBT activist.<br />Carmichael’s early story, as Jerry Michael, would make for a tantalizing road movie/caper film. He marries young Vivian Barrett (her brother, Charles Richard Barrett, is one of the series’ more forthcoming interview subjects) and together they lead a life on the lam while raising five kids. The children included Candi Michael, whose recollections are not just astounding, but delivered with no trace of bitterness or regret for not having had a more traditional upbringing—or one in which her family wouldn’t have had to drop everything and flee at the hint of police at the door, something they did routinely. Cataloging the many scams of her dad—whom she eventually came to call mom—Ms. Michael recalls a Jacuzzi-like unit that was supposed to attach to a bathtub and which someone eventually developed legitimately and advertised on television. “That could have been us,” Ms. Michael remembers thinking, “if my father hadn’t been a criminal.”<br />The Michael story becomes the Carmichael story, and with it comes a more sobering assessment of Carmichael’s treatment by the criminal justice system and the L.A. media of the mid-’70s. She’s not an admirable character, except in her brazenness and audacity, but historian Susan Stryker and lawyer Mia Yamamoto argue her position of importance in the cultural and legal history of trans life. The visual approach of “The Lady and the Dale” is a questionable one—the series-long use of cutout animation, aka the stop-motion technique of combining photographs and other visual media to create naïve, collage-like action. It’s an approach too flippant for the subject matter. The filmmakers were likely looking for some way to break up the interview and archival news footage, and create re-enactments without actors. But their use of cutouts ultimately becomes tiresome.</td>

      <td>Denzel Washington and Rami Malek play cops tracking a serial killer in John Lee Hancock’s grim thriller.</td>
      <td>‘The Little Things,” in theaters and streaming on HBO Max, takes its title from advice that a veteran cop played by Denzel Washington gives to a young homicide detective played by Rami Malek: “It’s the little things that are important, Jimmy. It’s the little things that get you caught.” But the big things are important too—like giving the audience something pleasurable, enjoyable or minimally entertaining to relieve the encompassing gloom and the bilious palette. John Lee Hancock’s crime thriller, set in 1990, is steadfastly glum, a two-hour-plus tour of eroded souls, nighttime freeways, sinister streets, dark alleys, fetid rooms and female corpses perforated by stab wounds. Daylight intrudes from time to time, and a person of interest, played by Jared Leto, finally appears toward the end of the first hour—he’s interesting because he’s eerily playful as well as potentially criminal. For the most part, though, consider this a case of serial crime and unusual punishment. It’s almost no fun at all.<br />That’s more than a disappointment, it’s a bafflement. Why have we been hurled back into David Fincher territory? Not Mr. Fincher’s recent “Mank,” which is drawing-room comedy by comparison, but his definitively dark and intensely memorable “Se7en,” with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as a veteran and a rookie tracking down a depraved serial killer. In fact those tonal resemblances are misleading. Mr. Hancock wrote the first version of this script in 1993, a couple of years before “Se7en” was completed. All the same, what may have been bleakly original way back then isn’t now. It’s hard to watch Mr. Washington, in particular, trying to find some of his usual buoyancy as his character, a world-weary sheriff’s deputy, Joe “Deke” Deacon, pursues a secret agenda with relentless purpose and a heavy heart.<br />The story starts in Kern County, north of Los Angeles, where Deke is working far beneath his talent grade in a rural area near Bakersfield. A local robbery may be connected to a recent crime in L.A., so Deke’s captain sends him down to collect physical evidence after it’s been used in an preliminary hearing. Other connections emerge. Five years earlier Deke, then an L.A. County deputy, worked a murder case so obsessively, a former superior says, that “he got a suspension, a divorce and a triple bypass, all in six months.”<br />Now he’s mostly a pariah in the department, though it isn’t clear why; by all accounts he was a wizard at profiling serial killers. Mr. Malek’s detective, Jim Baxter, feels threatened when he senses Deke’s obsessive interest in his own case, a series of grisly assaults with multiple victims, all of them prostitutes, and no suspect. At the same time Deke, with his deep experience, is a source of wisdom and procedural knowledge, so the relationship develops along predictable lines. Wariness turns to partnership and, eventually, friendship. (John Schwartzman did the cinematography. Thomas Newman wrote the music.)<br />How fascinating you find the premise depends for much too long on your tolerance for hauntedness—Deke is more obsessed than Jimmy can know. He suffers from serial flashbacks, all of them shot in clammy darkness, to an old crime scene that continues to haunt him. He communes with—talks with, at mawkish length—some of the recently discovered corpses, the point being that cops must never, and cannot ever, forget the victims: “They’re your lifelong responsibility, Jimmy. You own them.” I owned a deep sense of discomfort (which the movie means us to feel) that gave way to increasing boredom until the search led to an appliance repair store in a seamy area of the San Fernando Valley, and to one of its employees, Albert Sparma, the suspect played by Mr. Leto.</td>

      <td>The accidental parent is so reliable a character in fiction that one can think of multiple examples without making any effort at all (“Silas Marner,” “The Kid,” “A Perfect World,” “Horton Hatches the Egg”). But what “Palmer” indicates, aside from Justin Timberlake being a terrific actor, is that time and the proper talent can make a clichéd premise into something classic.<br />Directed with a sensitive hand by Fisher Stevens, “Palmer” begins with that old standby, the introductory aerial shot, this one carrying us across bridges and bayous and into watery, exurban Louisiana. The shot might be a joke: Ex-con Eddie Palmer (Mr. Timberlake) doesn’t fly anywhere. He takes the bus, in this case home from years in prison for something we’ll learn about later. Short on small talk, shorter on job prospects, Eddie, who prefers to be called Palmer, settles in with his grandmother Vivian (the always memorable June Squibb), who makes him go to church. His parole officer makes him look for work.<br />The creation of screenwriter Cheryl Guerriero, Palmer is the personification of regret, humiliation, frustration and considerable anger, which he keeps contained, at least until he witnesses the treatment of Sam (Ryder Allen), the nonbinary kid next door. Sam’s mother, Shelly (Juno Temple), who resides with her son in the trailer behind Vivian’s house, is a drug addict apt to disappear for weeks on end. Adding to the boy’s woes—though Sam is refreshingly stoic regarding just about everything—is his affinity for tutus and tea parties. “Boys don’t play with dolls,” says Palmer, to which Sam replies, “I’m a boy and I do.” Argue with that, neighbor.<br />What Ms. Guerriero has fashioned so honestly, with Messrs. Stevens and Timberlake making it tangible, is how Palmer regards the child. He isn’t inclined to be open-minded about Sam’s gender identity: Palmer grew up in the same place, and with the same attitudes, as his buddies, many of whom treat Sam like a freak. So do many of the kids at school (where Sam’s few allies include Miss Maggie, Sam’s teacher and Palmer’s paramour-to-be, played by the terrific Alisha Wainwright).<br />But Palmer knows what it’s like to be an outsider; he carries his pariah status around, albatross-like, which is a reason the head custodian (Lance E. Nichols) goes to bat with the school in getting Palmer hired as his assistant. It’s a dicey setup already, but when Shelly disappears for what seems like forever—it’s not; that’s how these stories work—Palmer becomes Sam’s surrogate dad and their relationship is the most endearing thing in a film with no shortage of virtues, or first-rate acting.</td>

      <td>Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan star as the duo behind a major archaeological discovery, a real event that astounded British scholars on the eve of World War II.</td>
      <td>Every now and then a film comes along—not a great one, necessarily—that makes you deeply glad. It’s how I feel about “The Dig.” This modest and quirky feature, set in rural England immediately before World War II, dramatizes one of the most important archaeological finds of the 20th century, a pair of medieval cemeteries, one of them containing an Anglo-Saxon ship filled with magnificent artifacts. I’m glad it got made—not a sure thing at all in a relentlessly commercial market—and made with such intelligence and respect for the factual details of the discovery by people who obviously loved what they were doing; glad it’s available to a wide audience on Netflix; and glad to have gained from it a heightened, and lengthened, sense of human history that the filmmakers convey in a style that’s the antithesis of grandiose.<br />The dig in question has come to be called Sutton Hoo, after its site on the banks of a tidal river in Suffolk. The film, directed by Simon Stone and adapted by Moira Buffini from a John Preston novel about the discovery, plunges us into the adventure by following an unassuming gent named Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) as he bicycles his way to the fairly imposing house of Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan), a widow eager to investigate a mysterious group of mounds on her property. The project calls for an archaeologist—not Indiana Jones, necessarily, but someone with more extensive training than Basil, who was, in real life, the man who made the discovery, and who describes himself here with with laconic pride as a lifelong excavator. Yet the nation is preparing for war, no archaeologists are available and Basil will have to do.<br />Thus does “The Dig” deftly address issues of class—Basil knows more about the history and texture of Suffolk’s soil than any credentialed expert a museum might have sent—while giving us a prime example of an archetype dear to English films, the calmly eccentric self-taught scholar (who of course smokes a pipe). Mr. Fiennes is superb in the role—you’ll be glad to watch him digging away with his shovel, and you’ll be thrilled, as I was, when, after digging for a good while, he shows up at Edith’s door and says, his voice quivering with emotion, “I think you’d better come and see.” (The emotional spectrum of the cinematography, by Mike Eley, ranges from solemn to ecstatic.)<br />The whole cast is superb. Ms. Mulligan brings a muted radiance to Edith, whose vitality is limited by disease. Archie Barnes is Edith’s young son, Robert; he devours sci-fi tales of the 25th century in his well-worn copies of Amazing Stories while a scientific tale of the sixth century unfolds around him. Ken Stott is Charles Phillips, an archaeologist from the British Museum who first sees Basil as little more than an annoying rustic. Charles comes around, as you might guess, announcing grandly that, on the basis of Basil’s discovery, the Anglo-Saxons “were not just marauding barterers. They had culture! They had art! They had money!” Basil is more eloquent, in his plain-spoken way. “From the first human handprint on a wall,” he says, “we’re part of something continuous.”<br />Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com</td>

      <td>The EU blows its rollout and blames a pharmaceutical firm.</td>
      <td>As the European Union fumbles its vaccine rollout, officials in Brussels are looking for villains. They think they’ve found one in vaccine-maker  AstraZeneca .<br />Rather than letting countries negotiate their own vaccine contracts, the European Commission handled procurement for the entire bloc in the name of solidarity. Brussels botched the process, and now the union’s members are lagging together.<br />Europe, the U.S. and U.K. have orders or options for roughly the same number of doses per capita. But the U.S. and U.K. moved faster to secure contracts, which made it easier for pharmaceutical companies to prepare. Washington and London also spent about seven times as much on development, production and procurement per person, according to the British analytics firm Airfinity. Some U.S. states face distribution challenges like many European countries, but American and British regulators approved vaccines faster than their EU counterparts.<br />The results are already clear. By our deadline Thursday, the U.K. had administered doses to more than 11% of residents, while the U.S. was approaching 8%. Denmark was a European success story at 3.7%, while France and Sweden languished around 2%.<br />This hasn’t inspired much reflection in Brussels. EU mandarins spent this week admonishing AstraZeneca after the firm announced that issues with production at a European factory meant it would delivers tens of millions of doses fewer than expected this quarter. The European Commission ordered a raid on AstraZeneca’s production site in Belgium on Wednesday.</td>

Vehicles that run on fossil fuels and emit pollution account for roughly 98% of GM’s sales today and all of its profit. The large pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles that are the company’s biggest money makers are also among its least fuel-efficient vehicles.<br />The nation’s largest auto maker by sales called the 2035 date to eliminate all tailpipe pollution an aspiration.

Apex Clearing, Mr. Denier said, was told by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. that it would need to put up more collateral to help facilitate the settling of trades.

Many of the stocks, including GameStop and  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,  fell sharply Thursday as some of the euphoria around the stocks abated. GameStop dropped 25%, while AMC fell 50%. Both stocks are still up more than 350% for the month.<br />Webull later said on Twitter that the firm was reopening trading in GameStop, AMC and headphone maker  Koss  Corp. , the three stocks it had restricted.</td>

      <td>WHEN I FIRST laid eyes on the 2021 Genesis GV80’s grille—a handsome pentagonal broadshield with a chain-mail gusset—it reminded me to call my friend Rob. He’s a trademark attorney.<br />I mean, do we not all see the resemblance to a Cadillac’s front acreage? How does that happen? The shapes and legally defined geometries of what are called down-the-road graphics represent car brands’ most sacred intellectual property, typically defended by attorneys with chain saws and hockey masks.<br />Genesis, Hyundai’s six-year-old premium/luxury brand, even minted the phrase “Crest Grille’’—you know, as in the Cadillac Crest, the standard of the world? And the worst part is, the GV80 looks great. That’s going to leave a taste in GM’s mouth like cat-turd toothpaste.<br />The GV80 ($48,900-$70,950 MSRP, plus $1,025 delivery) is a midsize, two- or three-row people-mover, sharing the company’s rear/all-wheel platform with the superb 2021 G80 sedan, as well as many engineering details: a choice between two engines—a 2.5-liter, 300-hp turbo-four; or a 3.5-liter, 375-hp twin-turbo V6—an eight-speed automatic transmission; and an optional rear-biased AWD.<br />In my review in December, I compared the G80 3.5T Prestige ($68,050, as tested) to a nuclear Godzilla of value, throbbing with Cherenkov radiation, stomping Stuttgart and Munich to fiery flinders (paraphrasing there).

The opening price values the company at approximately $24.5 billion. Qualtrics is trading on the Nasdaq under ticker symbol “XM.”<br />The company arrives on the public market during a pandemic that has amplified a digital transition many businesses are undertaking as they adopt tools to boost interaction with customers online and to better run internal processes. That focus on digital operations has heightened the importance of Qualtrics’s products, the company’s chief executive, Zig Serafin, told The Wall Street Journal.<br />Investors have rewarded companies that support digital commerce. Shares of companies such as  Salesforce.com Inc.,  whose software helps businesses manage customer relationships, and  Square  Inc.,  a digital-payments company, have surged over the last 12 months. Others such as  Snowflake  Inc.,  a data-warehousing company, have preceded Qualtrics in launching successful pandemic-era IPOs.<br />SAP, based in Germany, maintains a controlling stake in Qualtrics following Thursday’s offering, owning 84% of the company’s common stock and 98% of its voting rights. SAP acquired Provo, Utah-based Qualtrics for roughly $8 billion in early 2019. Qualtrics had been on the verge of going public by itself at the time.</td>

      <td>Thanks to twistable spines and loose skin, canines and other animals can efficiently spin water off their bodies.</td>
      <td>Physicist Helen Czerski explores the complex science behind familiar phenomena. Read more columns here.<br />I’m increasingly envious of the dogs in my neighborhood. I can’t swim at the moment because all U.K. sports facilities are closed, and even now, in the cold depths of winter, the local river and lakes look more and more inviting. As I gaze longingly, in the full knowledge that I hate freezing water and so a swim is just a dream, there’s inevitably a woof and a splash as a very happy dog just launches itself straight in. After some goofy frolicking, it will clamber out, shake itself off and trot away to investigate a nearby squirrel as if nothing had happened. The thing I’m most envious of is the drying process—four seconds and it’s done. How is that possible?<br />The first thing to know is that it’s not just dogs. In a 2012 paper, David Hu and colleagues at the Georgia Institute of Technology looked at 16 species that shake themselves dry, including mice, bears, kangaroos, sheep, and a lion, and laid out the foundation of what’s going on. (The researchers coyly admitted that they were unable to measure the lion’s body directly, demonstrating that discretion really is the better part of scientific valor.)<br />When a wet dog is standing still, the water is pulled downward by gravity and drips from the hair on its belly. It’s a slow process, but you can speed it up by creating a force that effectively boosts gravity, which is what a spin dryer does. As the drum spins, it pushes inward on the clothes, making them go around in circles and creating a centrifugal force that pulls the water outward, where it can escape through the holes in the drum. My home spin dryer can generate an effective force 800 times stronger than gravity, and drags water out of clothes pretty quickly.<br />Evolution doesn’t need a spinning drum because mice, dogs and bears can twist their spine, oscillating their body round and back to produce an effective force outwards. This is what they’re doing when they shake themselves dry.</td>

      <td>The short answer is the Margaret River region of Western Australia. But, after some searching, our wine columnist found a few delicious and affordable Cabs from California, too.</td>
      <td>TWO YEARS AGO I wrote a column describing my search for good Pinot Noirs under $20 a bottle. It wasn’t easy: Pinot Noir is a notoriously fickle grape, requiring just the right conditions to thrive, and the wines are both more difficult and more expensive to produce. Cabernet Sauvignon is a much easier, hardier grape. And yet, as I discovered in reporting this column, finding good, reasonably priced Cabernet can be just as hard, perhaps even harder.<br />Native to Bordeaux, France, Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the world’s most popular and most commonly planted grapes. It’s found just about anywhere winemakers are looking to make their mark—or lots of money—and produces both lofty and lousy wines. The former are made from grapes grown in great sites and carefully tended vineyards, fermented and aged in expensive French oak. The latter come from high-yielding vineyards, machine-harvested grapes fermented with oak chips and worse.<br />Mega Purple, for instance, is one of many additives that makers of commercial brands use to make the wine appear dark and suave and help mask green or herbaceous aromas of underripe grapes. But I wasn’t interested in featuring wines made from a confected combo of oak chips and sugar but, rather, from grapes grown to physiological ripeness, unmasked by excess oak. That eliminated the majority of the most popular Cab brands on the market today.<br />I started my search with an upper price limit of $20 a bottle but soon increased it to $25 when the pickings proved slim. I bought 17 bottles from various wine regions in California and Washington State as well as Australia, Argentina, Chile and even one wine from South Africa. Sadly, this example, the 2017 Stark-Condé Cabernet Sauvignon from the Stellenbosch region ($17), proved a disincentive to further South African Cabernet research.<br />Four Chilean Cabernets proved even more disappointing. I remember when Chilean Cabernets were pretty good, or at least not as aggressively herbaceous and weedy as the wines I bought. The 2017 Lapostolle Cuvée Alexandre Cabernet Sauvignon ($20) had an aromatic overlay of tobacco and dill. The 2017 Los Vascos Grande Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon ($12) and 2016 Montes Alpha Cabernet Sauvignon ($19) were equally stemmy and green.</td>

      <td>Facebook Inc.’s  independent content-oversight board issued its first five rulings Thursday, overturning four instances where it found the company unfairly infringed upon users’ speech on the platform or misapplied vague rules on content that could cause imminent harm.<br />Among the board’s decisions were a determination that Facebook’s algorithms were wrong to remove a post about breast cancer identification that featured a woman’s nipple, and a finding that Facebook had been too strict in removing a French user’s post praising hydroxychloroquine, a once widely discussed treatment for Covid-19 that medical authorities have generally found not to be effective.<br />The group also said Facebook erred in taking down a post from a user in Myanmar with photos of a drowned Syrian Kurd child with text that said Muslims were too focused on insults of the Prophet Muhammad and appeared unconcerned about the treatment of Muslim Uighurs in China. The post also stated that there was something psychologically wrong with Muslim men and “seems to imply the child may have grown up to be an extremist,” the board wrote.<br />Oversight-board members determined the post didn’t reach the level of hate speech that justified removal, despite Myanmar’s recent history of social-media-fueled violence against Muslims—which the United Nations has described as an example of ethnic cleansing.<br />The oversight board’s decision was faulted by a group of prominent Facebook critics who have dubbed themselves “The Real Facebook Oversight Board” as well as Muslim civil-rights organizations.</td>

A recommendation from the European agency not to use the shot in older people would upend national vaccination plans that are tilted toward protecting those most at risk of dying from the disease.<br />In a sign of the urgency spreading across the continent, German Chancellor Merkel will hold a national vaccination summit with representatives of manufacturers on Feb. 1 in an effort to resolve the shortage of vaccines, her office said late on Thursday.<br />Europe is already lagging behind the U.K. and the U.S., which have vaccinated 11.3% and 7.1% of their populations respectively, according to data from Oxford University. By comparison, the EU has vaccinated just 2.2 % of its 450 million people.</td>

The brokerage cited “extraordinary volatility in the markets.”<br />“We do not believe this situation will subside until the exchanges and regulators halt or put certain symbols into liquidation only,” Interactive Brokers said in another tweet, noting that it may add or remove other stocks as warranted.</td>

That group offers a right-wing alternative to Mr. Netanyahu for the coming election on March 23, the fourth parliamentary ballot in less than two years.<br />Unlike Israel’s elections over the past decade, where Mr. Netanyahu fended off challenges from the left and center, Mr. Saar is mounting a serious leadership challenge to his former mentor from the right.<br />That poses a significant threat to Mr. Netanyahu, who faces criticism over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his corruption trial. If Mr. Saar can continue to siphon off support from Mr. Netanyahu among right-wing parties in parliament, he could block the prime minister’s return to office.</td>

Police this week have detained a number of Mr. Navalny’s allies, including his brother Oleg, and raided apartments and offices, alleging the protests violated health and safety rules during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Among those detained were Lyubov Sobol, a lawyer on Mr. Navalny’s team; Ilya Pakhomov, an assistant to the opposition politician; and Anastasia Vasilieva, who runs an affiliated medical workers’ advocacy group.<br />Mr. Navalny’s supporters say the legal actions are in retribution for the weekend protests.</td>

      <td>He’s ordered a review of a Trump policy against settlement payouts to favored third parties.</td>
      <td>Buried in the Biden administration’s flurry of early executive orders is a potential challenge to the core legislative function: the power to tax and spend. Under the proposal, the Justice Department may revert to using its enforcement power to force companies under investigation to give billions of dollars to outside interest groups—a common practice before June 2017. Implicitly, this amounts to a federal appropriation unauthorized by Congress.<br />After the 2008 financial crisis, for instance, the Obama administration’s Justice Department extracted multibillion-dollar settlement deals from major banks. These agreements directed the banks to send almost half the settlement dollars not to the Treasury or the actual victims of corporate misconduct but to “consumer relief” payments directed by administration officials. Among these payments: funding for new “affordable housing” developments, as well as gifts to government-sanctioned community-development, legal-aid and housing activist groups.<br />Although the Obama Justice Department was unusually aggressive in using threats to make implicit appropriations, it didn’t invent the approach. Under George W. Bush, Justice entered a deferred prosecution agreement with  Bristol Myers Squibb  that required the company to endow a professorship at Seton Hall University’s law school—alma mater of Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney overseeing the settlement deal. The professorship? A chair in business ethics.<br />Early in the Trump administration, Attorney General Jeff Sessions put an end to such practices. Under the policy Mr. Sessions adopted, “any agreement on behalf of the United States in settlement of federal claims or charges” couldn’t direct or provide for “a payment or loan to any non-governmental person or entity that is not a party to the dispute.” There were exceptions, as codified last year in a final rule—among them, restitution to actual victims, lawyer fees and “payments expressly authorized by statute.”<br />Mr. Sessions was right. Law enforcement necessarily generates some revenues from private parties. Money flows to the U.S. Treasury from statutorily authorized fines. In some cases, defendants should pay restitution to victims of civil or criminal misconduct. Yet that’s different from reallocating fines or restitution payments to unrelated third parties.</td>

It was no accident that the brokerage firm that finds itself in the news lately chose that name, even if its novice customers often unwittingly did the opposite until this week when they rocked the hedge-fund world.<br />Robinhood’s customers were enraged on Thursday when it halted new buy orders on stocks like  GameStop ,  furthering the belief that fat cats were once again rigging the market against the little guy. Ironically, though, a misplaced target of their ire was Robin Hood, a New York charity that most definitely helps the poor. It was forced to respond over and over again to angry traders on Twitter.<br />Also ironic is that the escapades of Robinhood’s brokerage clients probably made a dent in the fortunes of some of the eponymous charity’s donors. The charity organization’s board includes hedge-fund stars David Einhorn, Paul Tudor Jones, Larry Robbins and David Tepper. Steven A. Cohen, an emeritus board member, certainly took a financial hit this week as his Point72 Asset Management was forced to come to the assistance of his former protégé at Melvin Capital Management, which made disastrous short bets on GameStop.<br />It is all fun and games until someone loses a charitable deduction.<br />Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com</td>

      <td>Historian Amanda Foreman searches the past for the origins of today’s world. Read previous columns here.<br /><br />Nowadays, all it takes for a person to be condemned to internal exile is a  Twitter  stampede of outrage. The lack of any regulating authority or established criteria for what constitutes repentance gives “cancel culture,” as it is popularly known, a particularly modern edge over more old-fashioned expressions of public shaming such as tar-and-feathering, boycotts and blacklists.<br />But the practice of turning nonconforming individuals into non-persons has been used with great effectiveness for centuries, none more so than the punishment of excommunication by the Roman Catholic Church. The penalties included social ostracism, refusal of communion and Christian burial, and eternal damnation of one’s soul.<br />The fear inspired by excommunication was great enough to make even kings fall in line. In 390, soldiers under the command of the Roman emperor Theodosius I massacred thousands in the Greek city of Thessalonica. In response, Bishop Ambrose of Milan excommunicated Theodosius, forcing him to don sackcloth and ashes as public penance. Ambrose’s victory established the Church’s authority over secular rulers.</td>

      <td>Sotheby’s sold Sandro Botticelli’s circa-1480 portrait of a “Young Man Holding a Roundel” for $92.2 million to a Russian-speaking collector during a live-streamed online sale Thursday, breaking the Italian Renaissance artist’s sales record and reaffirming a global appetite for trophy art following a tough year in the art market.<br />The portrait was estimated to sell for around $80 million, but a pair of anonymous telephone bidders vied for the work, with an Asian bidder losing quickly to a Russian-speaking bidder. The competition lacked the typical sizzle of a blockbuster sale moment, though.<br />Still, the work easily surpassed the artist’s previous record of $10.4 million when in 2013 Christie’s sold his “Madonna and Child with Young Saint John the Baptist,” also known as the Rockefeller Madonna because of its ties to the banking family.<br />The portrait also marked the year’s first major test of the art market and may go some way toward shoring up collector confidence in blue-chip masterworks—after collectors largely retrenched to lower-priced art amid the pandemic. Christie’s didn’t auction off a single work of art for over $80 million last year; Sotheby’s sold one work, a Francis Bacon, for $85 million. Overall, Sotheby’s sales fell 12% to $5 billion last year.<br />It may have helped that the Botticelli was being sold by the estate of New York real-estate developer Sheldon Solow, who spent decades amassing an enviable collection of Egyptian antiquities as well as art by Pablo Picasso, Alberto Giacometti and Vincent Van Gogh. Mr. Solow, who died last November, paid $1.2 million for the Botticelli in 1982.</td>

      <td>It isn’t every day that  Facebook  can claim to be under someone’s thumb. The social network giant may be overplaying its hand.<br />Facebook, currently the sixth most valuable company in the S&P 500, used its fourth-quarter earnings call late Wednesday to step up its case against  Apple Inc.,  the benchmark index’s most valued enterprise. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg mentioned the iPhone maker more than half a dozen times in his opening presentation, describing Apple as “one of our biggest competitors,” and one that has “every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own.” For good measure, he also criticized the security of Apple’s highly popular iMessage service.<br />The source of his ire is a coming update to Apple’s iOS operating system that will require users to opt-in to ad-tracking features used by Facebook and many other internet advertisers. Apple confirmed Wednesday that the update—known as App Tracking Transparency, or ATT—is coming this spring, after having delayed its original plan to include the feature in its first release of iOS 14 last September.<br />The change has companies across the internet advertising space worried. Google on Wednesday warned its ad partners in a blog post that Apple’s changes “will reduce visibility into key metrics” that will affect how advertisers bid on ad impressions. “As such, app publishers may see a significant impact to their Google ad revenue on iOS after Apple’s ATT policies take effect.”<br />Facebook’s outcry was louder. With no sense of irony, a company that generated more than $84 billion in advertising revenue last year is casting itself as a champion of the little guy. Mr. Zuckerberg said Wednesday that the change means “many small businesses will no longer be able to reach their customers with targeted ads.” And he accuses Apple of acting in its own competitive interests. Advertising was indeed the second-largest driver of Apple’s service revenue that jumped 24% year over year to nearly $15.8 billion in the December quarter.</td>

Among other strategic efforts, giant car insurer USAA has been working since 2019 with  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google Cloud unit to develop a photo-based estimating program for its policyholders.<br />Under Tractable’s approach, computers study the damage in photographs, which can be taken by policyholders while still at the wreck site or later. To produce estimates, the algorithms tap into data from a provider of parts and labor data.<br />Once the estimate is generated, policyholders can select a recommended body shop and get the repair work started.</td>

      <td>The fourth quarter’s growth was concentrated at the start of the quarter, leaving the economy in a weak position now</td>
      <td>The U.S. economy ended last year with a whimper. It is no sure thing that it will end this year with a bang.<br />The Commerce Department on Thursday reported that gross domestic product grew at a 4% annual rate in the fourth quarter from the previous, after growing at a 33.4% rate in the second quarter. These annualized figures show what would happen if the quarterly change lasted full a year. In actual terms, GDP grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 7.5% in the third—not enough to take the economy out of the hole the Covid-19 crisis put it into in the first half of the year. GDP last quarter was 2.5% lower than a year earlier.<br />More worryingly, the fourth quarter’s gain in GDP from the previous quarter came about because the fourth quarter started so well. Monthly GDP estimates from IHS Markit show that GDP in October was up about 0.6% from September, and was 1.4% higher than its third quarter average. But November was worse, with rising Covid-19 cases stifling consumer spending. And though Thursday’s report suggests that the economy recovered a bit of ground in December (IHS’s December estimates aren’t available yet), it looks as though GDP was below its October level.<br />Mechanically, that makes it harder for GDP to register growth in the first quarter—if it began the fourth quarter on third base, it began the current quarter in the batter’s box and behind in the count. Still, thanks in large part to the $900 billion relief package that passed late last year, economists are forecasting GDP will post modest growth in the first quarter. Then in the second quarter, with another relief package expected and vaccines more widely available, they expect growth to be much stronger.<br />Beyond the mechanics, the weakening in GDP in the fourth quarter brings home how the economy remains in the pandemic’s grip. While a tailspin like last spring’s isn’t in the cards, renewed caution and restrictions can still stifle growth. Moreover, while there is plenty of reason to hope vaccines will bring the coronavirus under control later this year, there are also reasons for caution. The emergence of mutations that current vaccines may not be effective against, such as the variant believed to have emerged in the Brazilian Amazon, raises the possibility that in a year’s time the country will still be hobbled by Covid-19.</td>

The ruling, more than 200 pages long, said that allowing abortion because of congenital defects violated the Polish constitution, which protects all human life.<br />Further protests are planned this week, reflecting broader concern among younger Poles over the conservative policies of Poland’s government, which is allied with the Catholic Church and has tried to tighten Poland’s already-strict abortion laws since coming to power in 2015. Similar protests last fall drew tens of thousands of people in Warsaw alone.<br />Many demonstrators say they are concerned over the way the ruling Law and Justice party previously purged members of the Constitutional Tribunal and replaced them with conservative judges, drawing criticism from the European Union and elsewhere.<br />Anita Czerwińska, spokeswoman for the Law and Justice party, said it is still studying the court’s judgment before commenting. The party has said that the court is responsive to the wishes of Polish voters, who have repeatedly handed Law and Justice majorities in Poland’s parliament.</td>

For those eager beavers ready to flit off to Europe as soon as they get the all-clear, file away these inviting newcomers:<br />Last September, Madrid’s hotel scene ascended a few rungs on the luxury ladder with the opening of Spain’s first Four Seasons Hotel, set in a landmark former bank building in the middle of the city. Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, and the art museums along the Paseo del Prado are just a short stroll away. The suites are massive, the views impressive and the spa and fitness center take over four floors. On a rooftop terrace, chef Dani García, has been luring the locals with his fabulous but informal restaurant Dani (from $660 a night, fourseasons.com/madrid). By the end of 2021—when, with luck, the pandemic will be behind us—the hotel will face more top-of-the-market competition: the newly renovated Mandarin Oriental Ritz next to the Prado and Rosewood’s overhaul of the Villa Magna in tony Barrio de Salamanca.<br />Among the hotels that saw their spring 2020 launch stymied by Covid was Lisbon’s Hotel Palácio Príncipe Real. Respecting the floor plan of a 19th-century palace that has been in the same family for a century, the hotel features 26 rooms, each decorated in a style best described by hotel owner Gail Curley as “pared-down palatial.” A jacaranda tree shading the exuberant garden inspired the decoration of several rooms as well as the color of the pool towels (from about $300 a night, palacioprincipereal.com).<br />When it opened last January, the J.K. Place Paris unleashed a maximalist Milanese design in the midst of the quaint Left Bank. While the lobby, bar and skylit Casa Tua restaurant are urbanely eclectic (modernist furniture meets African fabrics, 18th-century Chinese screens, and oodles of contemporary art), a quieter story plays out upstairs where the rooms might be too restrained, limited to subtle tonalities of gray and white. Good thing that, especially in Paris, one ought not spend much time in a hotel room (from about $775 a night, jkplace.paris).<br />After 15 years spent converting two dozen abandoned farmhouses on his family’s 3,700-acre Umbrian estate into luxury villas, Count Benedikt Bolza has now restored the estate’s 11th-century Castello di Reschio into a 36-room hotel. Guests can flop by the swimming pool or explore the miles of rolling hills surrounding the castle on foot, bicycle or horseback(from about $915 a night, reschio.com). In Sicily, the Relais & Châteaux Il San Corrado di Noto brings a new level of 21st-century luxury to a region better known for its fusty baroque style and vast acres of agriculture. The new resort features 26 suites set among a restored 18th-century manor house, stables and olive groves. Chef Ciccio Sultano (his restaurant, Duomo, in nearby Ragusa Ibla, has two Michelin stars) designed the menu to highlight the cultures that have informed Sicily’s evolution over the millennia (from about $725 a night, ilsancorradodinoto.com).</td>

      <td>Criminal complaint from BaFin comes after it let staff trade shares of the company during investigation</td>
      <td>Germany’s stock-market regulator said Thursday that it filed a criminal complaint with prosecutors against one of its employees over suspected insider trading linked to  Wirecard AG , raising fresh questions about the supervisor’s handling of one of the country’s biggest corporate scandals.<br />BaFin, the regulator, said the employee sold structured products linked to Wirecard on June 17, the day before the company said its auditors couldn’t confirm the existence of some $2 billion in cash. Shares of the fintech company crashed, and days later it filed for bankruptcy. Prosecutors are investigating allegations ranging from accounting manipulation to money laundering.<br />BaFin said it found out about the suspicious trading during a special audit, and that it reported the employee to the Stuttgart public prosecutor’s office Wednesday. The unnamed employee, who has been suspended, isn’t senior staff, a person familiar with the probe said.<br />German lawmakers have criticized BaFin for failing to act earlier on red flags over Wirecard. The regulator drew criticism last year after admitting it allowed its staff to trade the company’s shares while it was investigating it, something many regulators around the world forbid. Amid the backlash, BaFin in October decided to ban most of its staff from trading shares and other securities from financial companies.<br />The head of another German regulator—Apas, which oversees auditors—disclosed in December that he had also traded shares of Wirecard while he oversaw a probe of the company’s auditor, Ernst & Young GmbH. He has since been suspended.</td>

      <td>President’s team confronts a thicket of complications in its goal of a renewed nuclear deal and follow-on accord</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden’s national security team foresees a rocky road in pursuing one of his principal foreign policy promises: persuading Iran to return to the 2015 nuclear deal and then pressing for a follow-on accord that sets tougher limits.<br />The new administration jump-started its diplomatic agenda in its first days in office by extending the New Start nuclear arms-control treaty with Russia and rejoining both the Paris climate accord and the United Nations’ World Health Organization.<br />But its hopes to coax Iran back into the nuclear accord are a far thornier prospect, with U.S. sanctions policy potentially posing an early diplomatic obstacle.<br />The U.S., under the terms of the 2015 accord, agreed to ease a specific set of sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in exchange for constraints on Iran’s nuclear program. Separate U.S. sanctions, levied against Iran under authorities targeting terrorism, ballistic-missile development and human rights abuses, weren’t part of the nuclear deal.<br />“If Iran comes back into compliance, we would, too,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was confirmed to his post by senators on Tuesday, testified last week.</td>

      <td>U.K.-based liquor company is reaping the benefits of buying high-end brands like Casamigos tequila</td>
      <td>American drinkers have saved the day at  Diageo .  That is partly because the liquor giant has been savvy at figuring out what U.S. consumers want.<br />On Thursday, the owner of Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker scotch, said U.S. liquor sales rose 15% in the six months through December compared with the same period of 2019, stripping out currency and portfolio changes. Consumers in the U.K.-based company’s largest market are drinking more at home during the pandemic. They are also returning to trusted brands such as Baileys, which has helped Diageo to gain around 15 basis points of market share since July.<br />Buoyant demand in the U.S. made up for much harsher conditions elsewhere. Sales in Europe and Turkey, the company’s second-largest market by revenue, fell 10%. Although recovering, the region will be under pressure until bars and restaurants can reopen. Unlike Americans, Europeans tend to do more of their drinking outside the home.<br />Business in Asia is suffering from the sharp fall in airport duty-free sales. In Latin America, consumers are starting to trade down to cheaper brands as their disposable incomes are pinched. Overall, Diageo’s sales increased by just 1% over the six months through December, beating expectations of a decline.<br />The American market has been a bright spot for most drinks companies since Covid-19 went global. Tonic-water maker FeverTree, which also reported results Thursday, said its U.S. sales increased 23% in 2020. But Diageo is also reaping the rewards of a recent effort to tidy up its portfolio. In late 2018, it sold 19 lower-priced brands to privately owned Sazerac and has focused instead on fast-growing and higher-margin categories like gin and tequila.</td>

      <td>THE ONLY child of a tobacco tycoon, Doris Duke had tripled her inheritance to $1.2 billion by the time she died in 1993 at age 80, leaving most of it to charity. No surprise that displays of wealth dot her personal bathroom at Rough Point—the 39,000-square-foot estate in Newport, R.I., in which she summered. Blingy light fixtures illuminate gilt French antiques. But unlike, say, a “Real Housewives” McMansion, the décor avoids nouveau riche peacocking thanks largely to the earthy, leaf-strewn wallpaper, which clambers from floor to ceiling. The pattern evokes the extensive grounds that Duke’s pet Bactrian camels, Princess and Baby, roamed during her summer sojourns.<br />“It’s so wonderful, like Irish heather,” said decorator Carleton Varney of the wall covering. The powder room is a favorite spot of Mr. Varney, who worked with design luminary Dorothy Draper from 1962 until 1969, and bought her namesake company. From offices in Palm Beach he carries on her mission of merrily undercutting the predictability of fairly traditional furniture with juicy-hued patterns and jolting contrasts.<br />Rough Point, built in 1891 for Frederick W. Vanderbilt, is now a museum, with this room exactly as Duke left it: the simple, checkered marble floor grounding the sort of sparkle Mr. Varney believes the house demands. Here, he offers ways to approximate that old-money balance.<br />Duke brought a bit of Paris home with her in the form of a souvenir chandelier that dates to the 1750s, festooned with glass rosettes and gilt faux candles. Though fanciful, its emerald-glass leaves align visually with the down-to-earth wallcovering. Hang a comparable—though admittedly less glittery—French 19th-Century Painted Tôle Three-Light Chandelier with Flowers and Vines. $2,950, 1stdibs.com<br />The classic checkered black-and-white marble floor moors the room. “Ms. Draper always said every room needs a touch of black as an anchor,” Mr. Varney said. Woven into the similarly grounding wool rug: sea horses and circles that echo the dolphin taps and the motif on the tub. (The graphic on the marble tub also adds structure; for a similar touch on your own tub, Mr. Varney would use masking tape to prep the pattern, then spray paint it.)

Measured from the fourth quarter to the same quarter a year ago, the economy shrank 2.5%.<br />The coronavirus and related business disruptions put in place early in the pandemic upended the U.S. economy early last year, triggering business and school closures, a steep drop in demand for goods and services and record job losses.

They point to a slowing economic recovery, as surging coronavirus case numbers, fresh safety restrictions and colder weather hamper the labor market’s recovery from the initial shock of the pandemic last spring.

Abraaj before its fall had said it managed almost $14 billion for investors including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Bank of America Corp., the World Bank and the U.S. and U.K. governments. Mr. Naqvi is accused of taking hundreds of millions of dollars from the firm.<br />Mr. Naqvi was arrested at London’s Heathrow Airport in April 2019 as he returned from Pakistan, where he was born. He faces a prison sentence of up to 291 years if found guilty of all the charges from the Justice Department. He is currently under home confinement in London while out of custody on bail.<br />Judge Emma Arbuthnot announced her decision to allow Mr. Naqvi’s extradition in a London court Thursday. His lawyer last year argued that extradition would violate Mr. Naqvi’s human rights because U.S. jail conditions are so bad they raise the risk of making him suicidal if he was detained ahead of his trial. The case is now referred to the U.K. home secretary, and Mr. Naqvi will be able to appeal the decision, the judge said.<br />“His unshakable conviction is that he is entirely innocent,” Mr. Naqvi’s lawyer Hugo Keith said in court last year.

Post-pandemic, those ancillary opportunities could prove to be more central to DoorDash’s growth thesis than bearish investors are appreciating.<br />The bulk of DoorDash’s appeal heading into its December IPO was how quickly it was able to go from 0 to 60 in food delivery. The company says it had just 17% U.S. market share in terms of total sales in January 2018 but that its share had grown to 50% as of last October—nearly twice that of its next-largest competitor, Uber Eats. Now it turns out that in more nascent markets like convenience delivery, DoorDash has been growing even more quickly.<br />A report out from Edison Trends Thursday shows DoorDash now owns 58% of U.S. convenience-store spending via third-party delivery apps, more than twice that of its next-largest competitor, goPuff. Last January, Edison Trends had DoorDash’s share at around 5% and goPuff at 70%. For all of Uber’s talk of leaning strongly into auxiliary delivery services, Uber Eats’ market share in third-party convenience goods is now just 8%, according to the report.<br />For DoorDash, the convenience market may be more than just icing on the cake. Based on Edison Trends’ analysis, overall online consumer spending at convenience stores grew nearly 350% in 2020, nearly three times faster than online restaurant consumer sales. DoorDash customers increased their convenience-store spending by 162% sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter, according to EdisonTrends’ data—a good sign for DoorDash’s first earnings report as a public company coming up late next month.</td>

      <td>Decline in cigarette sales stopped last year amid health concerns about e-cigarettes; ‘Trust the devil you know’</td>
      <td>The decadeslong decline in U.S. cigarette sales halted last year as people in lockdown lit up more frequently and health concerns around e-cigarettes caused some vapers to switch back to cigarettes.<br />Before the pandemic, U.S. cigarette unit sales had been falling at an accelerating rate, hitting 5.5% in 2019, as smokers quit or switched to alternatives like e-cigarettes. The pandemic put the brakes on that slide. In 2020, the U.S. cigarette industry’s unit sales were flat compared to the previous year, according to data released Thursday by Marlboro maker  Altria Group Inc.<br />People had more opportunities to smoke because they spent more time at home and had more money to spend on cigarettes because they spent less on gas, travel and entertainment, Altria said. At the same time, some e-cigarette users turned back to combustible cigarettes because of increased e-cigarette taxes, bans on flavored vaping products and confusion about the health effects of vaping, consumers and industry officials say.<br />U.S. cigarette sales were even stronger last year than they were in 2015, when many consumers switched back to cigarettes after trying first-generation vaping devices. Those early products didn’t deliver nicotine effectively enough to satisfy some addicted cigarette smokers. But e-cigarette sales took off again in 2017, spurred by the popularity of a new vaporizer called Juul.<br />E-cigarette sales were booming in the fall of 2019 when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, investigating an outbreak of a mysterious lung illness, warned consumers not to use any vaping products. Sales took a nosedive. The illness later was linked to vitamin E oil in marijuana vaping products, but the public’s perception of e-cigarette safety hasn’t rebounded and neither have sales.</td>

      <td>The European Central Bank is worried lenders in the eurozone aren’t properly evaluating the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the financial health of borrowers, a problem that could result in a sudden cascade of defaults.<br />Andrea Enria, head of banking supervision at the ECB, said banks are setting aside less money to cover for loan losses than peers in other countries, including the U.S. He added that the provisions are below levels reached during the financial crisis and short of the levels models suggest are required.<br />“The way in which banks are preparing for asset quality deterioration varies widely and could, in some cases, be insufficient,” Mr. Enria said Thursday.<br />He expects the impact of renewed lockdowns will be reflected in banks’ fourth-quarter results and through 2021. Several eurozone banks are due to report their annual results next week.<br />The true health of eurozone borrowers has become harder to track due to the amount of financial support from the ECB and the region’s governments, which includes payment holidays on existing loans. In Italy, for instance, over a quarter of loans to businesses are under payment moratoriums. In Portugal, half of the credit to companies in the hospitality and restaurant sectors are under the program.</td>

      <td>Oil refiners and ethanol producers’ collective pain hasn’t done much to align their interests</td>
      <td>In the tug of war for former President Donald Trump’s favors, oil refiners won some surprising victories over ethanol producers. Their fortunes are about to flip under President Joe Biden’s climate-driven administration.<br />The fate of U.S. oil refiners and ethanol are inextricably linked through the so-called Renewable Fuel Standard, which sets annual quotas for the quantity of ethanol and biodiesel that must be blended into transportation fuels. The burden of meeting the blending requirements falls on those that refine or import oil. Those unable to meet any given year’s quota must fulfill it by buying Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) in the open market from those who have blended gallons to spare.<br />But sometimes the price of those RINs becomes excessively burdensome. Much to the ethanol industry’s chagrin, the Environmental Protection Agency issued 85 exemptions for refiners unable to meet the required blending requirements under the Trump administration—a big jump from the 23 given out during Barack Obama’s second term (prior to that, small refiners were automatically exempted). Exemptions are granted if refiners can prove they were unable to meet obligations without running into “disproportionate economic hardship.” The issue came into focus in 2018 when refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions went bankrupt, partly blaming Renewable Fuel Standard-related payments. That same year refiner  CVR Energy ,  owned by former Trump adviser Carl Icahn, also got a valuable exemption.<br />The next four years are likely to be tougher for oil refiners seeking relief. For one, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in January 2020 that the Environmental Protection Agency wrongly exempted three refineries from renewable fuel requirements. Its ruling also narrowed down the number of refiners that would qualify for future exemptions. Since that ruling, RIN prices have skyrocketed, fetching about 10 times what they did a year ago, according to data from S&P Global Platts. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to take up the case after two refiners appealed the decision.<br />The Biden administration has signaled climate issues as one of its priorities. New leadership at the EPA will be in charge of determining blending obligations for 2021, which the previous administration didn’t set by the Nov. 30 deadline. The new volume obligations likely won’t emerge until the second half of the year. Corey Lavinsky, director of global biofuels at S&P Global Platts, notes that Biden’s EPA is likely to set strong mandates for 2021 and 2022 and to enforce them.</td>

The program teaches officers to step in when another officer—including a higher-ranking one—uses excessive force or goes against police department guidelines.<br />More than 70 police departments large and small, from Orlando, Fla., and Washington, D.C., to Lafourche Parish, La., have enrolled in the program since it launched last June. Last month, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced that each of the state’s roughly 550 law-enforcement agencies will be required to complete the program.<br />The program’s creators say it has become a popular initiative with law enforcement in the wake of the protests that erupted across the country after the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis police custody.<br />The NYPD said it plans to certify 125 instructors through the program. The instructors will then provide the training to the department’s 35,000-plus officers, police officials said.

Smaller ones at convenience stores often have up to $20,000. During last spring’s pandemic lockdown, ATMs that normally held $50,000 might have contained $100,000, said 3SI Marketing Director Lisa Moughan, because banks and credit unions urged customers to use the machines for withdrawals when many branches temporarily closed.</td>

The IMF is the global lender of last resort to countries in distress and tracks debt levels closely. The total dollar value of global debt, which includes central and state government debt, came to $89.6 trillion at year’s end.<br />The increase was particularly large among advanced economies, which can easily borrow at low interest rates. The debt-to-GDP ratio among those nations rose to 123% by December from 105% in 2019, and it is expected to grow to 125% this year.<br />“From 2021 onwards, debt stabilizes at a high level and stays elevated well above the pre-Covid-19 level up to the end of” 2021, said Vitor Gaspar, director of the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department.<br />The IMF said governments should emphasize measures to combat the pandemic and cautioned against prematurely dialing back on spending.</td>

France is falling behind the rest of Europe in reducing emissions, and Mr. Macron hasn’t settled on a strategy to meet the country’s pledges under the Paris accord.<br />Mr. Macron created an assembly of everyday citizens to come up with a sweeping plan to place France on a trajectory to become carbon neutral by 2050.

Echoing many Democrats and abortion-rights advocates, he has said he backs ending a provision in spending bills known as the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funds from being used for abortions except in limited cases. But many Republicans say they will oppose any spending bill that doesn’t include the amendment.<br />The White House said Mr. Biden on Thursday will issue a “Presidential Memorandum to protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health care,” as part of a series of health care-related actions. Among its effects will be to reverse a rule known as the “Mexico City policy”—or, to critics, the “global gag rule.” The policy bars foreign nongovernmental groups that get U.S. funding from providing abortions or abortion information. Recent Democratic administrations have ended the policy, and Republican administrations have reinstated it.<br />The memorandum will also direct the Department of Health and Human Services to consider rescinding regulations under the federal Title X family-planning program. The Trump administration implemented one that cut off federal funding for organizations such as Planned Parenthood Federation of America.<br />“It is a good down payment, absolutely,” Ilyse Hogue, president of Naral Pro-Choice America, said of Mr. Biden’s anticipated early moves, adding that advocates of wider abortion access know the hurdles facing a repeal of the Hyde Amendment.</td>

The company reported earnings, adjusted for one-time items, of $1.70 a share for the quarter, missing analysts’ expectations of $1.77 a share. Revenue of $5.3 billion for the quarter also came in slightly below projections.<br />A surge in Covid-19 cases depressed sales across many consumer sectors late last year.

Diageo said sales in its largest market were also buoyed by a continuing shift among drinkers from beer and wine to spirits, and by a rush from distributors to restock.<br />Net spirits sales in the U.S. grew 15% in the last six months of 2020 on an organic basis, which strips out currency movements, driven by an 80% jump in tequila net sales as Don Julio and Casamigos were embraced by drinkers staying in. Tequila now accounts for 7% of Diageo’s global net sales, up from 1% five years ago.<br />Diageo said consumers in the U.S.—following the early days of lockdown when they stocked up on large bottles of booze—have been reaching for pricier liquor as they look to replicate a bar experience at home.<br />The company reported a 12% rise in U.S. sales for Baileys, which Chief Executive Ivan Menezes said reflected the company’s efforts to market the drink as a year-round treat rather than just a winter dessert liquor.

      <td>WASHINGTON—Cecilia Rouse’s interest in economics dates to the early 1980s, when she was a college freshman and the country was enduring its worst unemployment since the Great Depression.<br />“I was drawn to the discipline because I wanted to know why this was happening,” Ms. Rouse will testify Thursday to the Senate Banking Committee, which is considering her nomination to be President Biden’s top economist. “Why had jobs disappeared—and what could be done to bring them back?”<br />Ms. Rouse would be the first Black person to head the Council of Economic Advisers, which was created in 1946. Her research on labor markets, education and discrimination fits squarely with President Biden’s priorities of rebuilding a labor market that has lost nearly 10 million jobs during the pandemic and addressing racial and income disparities.<br />“It’s an excellent nomination,” said Greg Mankiw, who chaired the CEA under President George W. Bush and taught at Harvard when Ms. Rouse was working on her economics doctorate there. “I’m not expecting to agree with her on everything, but given what President Biden was looking for, he hit a home run with Ceci.”<br />Ms. Rouse, 57 years old, served as one of three members of the CEA during the first two years of the Obama administration and on President Bill Clinton’s National Economic Council in 1998 and 1999. She is dean of Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs.</td>

      <td>The electronics giant has built up a formidable war chest but it will need to spend heavily to maintain its edge</td>
      <td>Samsung  Electronics has been building up an impressive cash hoard over the past few years. Now, with the competition moving fast, it is time to spend to make sure the company can stay on the leading edge of the semiconductor and consumer-electronics industries.<br />The South Korean technology company had a strong 2020: Operating profit rose 30% year over year as the Covid-19 pandemic drove demand for memory chips, both in personal computers and data centers. The boom, however, now seems to be losing momentum. Operating profit last quarter dropped 27% from the previous quarter on a strong won and declining memory prices. The company expects profit to weaken this quarter.<br />The company has been building up dry powder: Net cash at the end of 2020 stood at 104.5 trillion won, equivalent to $93.4 billion, a 61% rise from 2017. Samsung announced a special dividend Thursday as well as raising its regular dividend in the next three years.<br />Samsung should also try to put some of that cash into growth. And the company has hinted that it could soon do exactly that. During the earnings call Thursday, it said it is optimistic about meaningful mergers and acquisitions in the coming three years.<br />Samsung hasn’t made a major acquisition since 2017. Acquiring a non-memory semiconductor or communications technology could help the company diversify away from the notoriously cyclical memory-chip business. More than half of Samsung’s operating profit last year came from its semiconductor division, mostly from memory chips.</td>

      <td>The Mach-E electric vehicle offers company a chance to boost interest in China after years of sluggish sales</td>
      <td>SHANGHAI— Ford  Motor Co. will build its iconic Mustang vehicles in China for the first time, the company said Thursday, as it tries to reconnect with Chinese consumers.<br />The locally built Mustang Mach-E, Ford’s flagship electric vehicle, which recently went on sale in the U.S., will be available in China later this year and challenge for a share of the Chinese high-end EV market, according to a company statement.<br />That’s fast becoming a crowded space. Earlier this month,  Tesla Inc.  started delivering its locally built Model Y—the second vehicle after the Model 3 produced at its Shanghai factory. Also this month,  Volkswagen AG  said it would soon begin delivering the first EVs produced at two newly built Chinese factories dedicated to electric cars.<br />Three Chinese premium EV startups,  NIO Inc.,   Li Auto Inc.  and  XPeng Inc.,  started gaining traction last year. The companies, all listed in the U.S., together delivered nearly 45,000 vehicles in China in the October-December quarter. NIO recently unveiled a new electric sedan, its fourth production model.<br />EV sales are expected to grow strongly in China. The government is targeting to sell around 5 million EVs annually by 2025, or a fifth of total vehicle sales. There were 1.11 million electric cars sold in China last year, according to the China Passenger Car Association, accounting for nearly 6% of the country’s car market.</td>

The surge during Apple’s most profitable quarter was fueled by the success of the company’s iPhone 12 series and lifted Apple to the No. 1 spot in the quarter, with 23% of the total market, according to IDC.<br />The company often sees a bump in quarterly smartphone sales during the final quarter on the heels of its latest iPhone launch.<br />“It’s traditionally a very strong quarter for Apple, but Apple is starting to consolidate their lead,” said Nicole Peng, an analyst at research firm Canalys, which also placed Apple at No. 1 during the quarter. “It feels like it’s back to its peak time from several years ago.”</td>

      <td>Medicaid work requirements enacted during the previous administration are already in court, complicating any quick reversals</td>
      <td>President Biden is set to sign executive orders Thursday directing the government to re-examine Trump-era health-care policies, which could lead to the unraveling of initiatives like Medicaid work requirements and short-term health plans.<br />But the process is likely to be long and met with legal battles.<br />Many rules or waivers approved by former President Donald Trump would require rule-making, public notice, or hearings before they could be unraveled. Some policies are already enmeshed in legal proceedings, which means the Biden administration in some cases would need to move swiftly to take action before court decisions are made.<br />States are likely to fight to preserve other Trump administration changes, such as a first-ever block grant in Tennessee that would cap federal funding for the state’s Medicaid program.<br />Mr. Biden is likely to stop short in the executive orders of calling for the policies and waivers to be gutted. The orders are expected to call for federal agencies to re-examine rules and policies that limit access to health care, including demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. Agencies will then consider whether to take additional action.</td>

      <td>Even small, fragile economies have issued debt this year at ultralow borrowing costs, thanks to substantial investor appetite</td>
      <td>Developing economies borrowed at a blistering pace at the start of the year after a record 2020, prompting questions among investors about whether they are building up debt problems for the future.<br />Governments and companies in developing countries have sold close to $100 billion of bonds so far in January, using the cash to plug budget deficits and shield themselves from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from Dealogic. In all of 2020, they borrowed $847 billion.<br />“We’ve never seen a busier start, in terms of issuance year to date—by a large margin,” said Stefan Weiler, a regional head of emerging-debt capital markets at JPMorgan. “From an issuer perspective, it’s hard to see market conditions improving.”<br />Benin, a small, rural West African nation that relies on cotton for most of its export income, raised €1 billion this month, equivalent to $1.2 billion, at an average yield of 5.4%, which was over half a percentage point lower than for a similar, smaller issuance in 2019.<br />The country was able to “seize the best market window available,” said Romuald Wadagni, Benin’s minister of economy and finance. He said more than 125 international investors bid for the bonds and noted that the 31-year bonds had the longest maturity of euro-denominated debt ever issued by an African country.</td>

      <td>ISLAMABAD—Pakistan’s top court acquitted the man convicted in 2002 of orchestrating the kidnapping and killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.<br />The Supreme Court dismissed on Thursday all charges against Omar Sheikh, a British citizen who has spent more than 18 years in prison in Pakistan for the crime.<br />The judges ordered that Mr. Sheikh be released from jail immediately, if not wanted in any other case. However, Pakistani authorities have  prevented Mr. Sheikh from walking free since a lower court ruled in April that he be released.<br />A lawyer for the government, Faiz Shah, said he was disappointed about Thursday’s outcome and said authorities would challenge the verdict. He said it remains to be seen whether Mr. Sheikh would remain in prison in the meantime.<br />The U.S. government has said it is willing to intervene in the case, but it isn’t clear how it could do so. Behind the scenes, U.S. officials say they have been pressing Pakistani authorities to keep Mr. Sheikh in prison. Pakistani ministers voiced concern last year about the prospect of Mr. Sheikh’s release.</td>
