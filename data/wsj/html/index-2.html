      <td>It will be up to Biden administration to pursue the rules, which also name Russia, Iran and North Korea</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—With its days in power numbered, the Trump administration’s Commerce Department moved ahead Thursday with rules to let the U.S. block purchases of communications technology from China and five other countries deemed foreign adversaries.<br />The rules wouldn’t take effect for 60 days, leaving a decision on how and whether to go ahead with the effort to President-elect Joe Biden’s administration. Mr. Biden’s advisers have said they intend to limit U.S. dependence on Chinese technology, but the incoming team hasn’t laid out specific policies.<br />“The rules are reasonable,” said a senior administration official, who added that he thought the incoming administration “will see the need for them.”  A Biden spokesman declined comment.<br />Along with China, Commerce named Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba and the Maduro government of Venezuela as foreign adversaries. Shipments of communications hardware, software and other gear from those nations could be blocked under the new rules as posing a national-security risk.<br />Under the proposal, Commerce would have 180 days decide whether  to allow the sales or require modifications of a transaction.</td>

The potential confirmation for Mr. Austin, whom President-elect Joe Biden named in December, isn’t expected to come until after Mr. Biden is inaugurated Jan. 20, requiring the Biden administration to name an individual to run the Pentagon in the interim.<br />John Kirby, a retired admiral who served as the top civilian communications adviser at the Pentagon, has been chosen to be the new press secretary at the Pentagon, officials said. The pick was first reported by the New York Times.<br />Mr. Norquist is considered a steady hand at the Pentagon, which has been led by five defense secretaries since President Trump took office in January 2017, officials said.<br />The Senate Armed Services Committee, the panel with jurisdiction over Mr. Austin’s nomination, will meet for its hearing on Jan. 19.</td>

According to a recent court filing, 611 children—some of whom were separated during an earlier pilot program—still haven’t been reunited with their parents.<br />President Trump ended the policy through an executive order on June 20 amid intense bipartisan blowback and global condemnation.<br />Though many of the outlines of the report’s findings have been previously reported in the media, the inspector general report is an official summation of the pressures and lack of planning that led to the long-term separation of thousands of families, many of whom said they were fleeing violence and poverty in Central America and coming to the U.S. to request humanitarian protection.</td>

Tom Rice cast his vote Wednesday to impeach President Trump, some GOP aides believed the conservative Republican had made an absent-minded mistake.<br />He had not.<br />Mr. Rice woke up Wednesday morning with his mind decided. He didn’t tell GOP leaders how he planned to vote or issue a statement beforehand. One week after he had been on the House floor when a violent mob stormed the Capitol, he voted to impeach, joining nine other House Republicans to side with Democrats in the 232-197 tally.<br />“I spent the last couple of days looking at what happened that day and what the president was doing while it was happening,” Mr. Rice said in an interview Thursday. “And the more I looked at it, the madder I got.”<br />Widely seen as the most surprising of the GOP votes to impeach Mr. Trump, Mr. Rice represents a safely Republican district in South Carolina that includes Myrtle Beach, and he has rarely broken with the party or the president. Now, Mr. Rice faces political blowback at home, but he says he felt compelled to vote against Mr. Trump.</td>

The company said it reached out to about 180 potential investors and buyers but found no takers for all or some of its stores, Ms. Jones said. However, the e-commerce business is an attractive asset for buyers, she said.</td>

      <td>Poshmark Inc.’s  stock more than doubled in its trading debut Thursday, reflecting a soaring market for public offerings and expectations that demand for secondhand goods sold online will grow after the economy returns to more normal conditions.<br />Shares of the online marketplace focused on used merchandise opened at $97.50, according to FactSet, above the company’s initial public offering price of $42. That better-than-targeted IPO price valued the company at more than $3 billion, up from a $1.25 billion valuation in 2019.<br />Proceeds from the IPO will be used in part to fund Poshmark’s growth strategy, which includes expanding into new product categories. Founder and Chief Executive Manish Chandra said in a Thursday interview that expansion will be guided by the needs of its seller community, and with an eye toward appealing to its broadening audience.<br />“We think of our platform as really something that is universally applicable,” Mr. Chandra said. He added, “Our sellers today span 98% of the ZIP Codes in the United States and really span all of the different age demographics. We’ve also diversified where we’re starting to be increasingly appealing to not just women, but also men.”<br />Private companies have been looking to cash in on robust demand from investors for new listings. Companies raised more than $167 billion on U.S. exchanges last year through Dec. 24, compared with the full-year record for funds raised through IPOs in 1999, during the dot-com boom, according to Dealogic.</td>

He was charged with wire fraud, failing to file a foreign bank account report and making a false statement in a tax return. The top prosecutor in Boston said Dr. Chen appeared to have acted out of loyalty to China.<br />The Trump administration has worked to combat what it views as aggressive efforts by Chinese government-linked entities to improperly obtain U.S. academic research and conduct other alleged meddling at U.S. campuses. Federal prosecutors have brought more than a dozen criminal cases accusing academics of lying about receiving Chinese government funding or alleging that visiting researchers lied about their affiliation with the Chinese military.<br />“The problem is not the collaboration itself,” said Andrew Lelling, U.S. Attorney for the district of Massachusetts, referring to work that researchers may do with foreign entities. “The problem is lying about it.”</td>

The ban also includes Panama and the Portuguese-speaking African nation Cape Verde.<br />“The decision to ban travel from these destinations follows the discovery of a new coronavirus variant first identified in Brazil, that may have spread to countries with strong travel links to Brazil,” the department said Thursday.<br />Infectious disease specialists in the Amazon have long feared that the hard-hit region could become a breeding ground for mutations of the virus as the local health system verges on collapse.</td>

      <td>The U.S. is a long way from a strong job market, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday, an indication that the central bank’s easy-money policies will remain in place for the foreseeable future.<br />Friday’s U.S. jobs report—which showed the U.S. lost 140,000 payroll positions in December—pushes the central bank farther from its goals, though officials and many private economists expect the economy to rebound this year as a Covid-19 vaccine is distributed through the population. A Wall Street Journal survey of forecasters this month projected the U.S. economy will grow 4.3% this year and the unemployment rate will drop from 6.7% in December to 5.3% by the end of this year.<br />“Now is not the time to be talking about exit” from easy money policies, Mr. Powell said in a webcast with Princeton University, his undergraduate alma mater, adding, “The economy is far from our goals.” In addition to high unemployment, he noted, inflation isn’t clearly on a path to reaching 2% on a sustained basis, even though it might spurt higher this year.<br />The Fed has pushed short-term interest rates to near zero and signaled it expects to keep them there for years. It also has been buying $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgages bonds, net of redemptions, every month since June and committed to continue doing that until it sees “substantial further progress” in the job market.<br />The central bank’s next policy meeting is Jan. 26-27 and little change is expected in policy or communication.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Banks would be prohibited from refusing to lend or provide other services to entire categories of lawful businesses under a rule a top bank regulator completed Thursday, his last day before stepping down.<br />The regulator, Brian Brooks, was responding in part to complaints from the oil-and-gas industry that it had been unfairly denied financing by large lenders. Completed just 10 days after its formal comment period ended—unusually quickly in the slow world of federal rule writing—the measure from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may be challenged by banks, which say it micromanages credit decisions.<br />The Biden administration may also seek to overturn the rule using a legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act.<br />Mr. Brooks, who is stepping down as acting Comptroller of the Currency later Thursday in the final days of the Trump administration, said in an interview that the rule revolves around the same concept of nondiscrimination requirements in lending. Banks can still deny services to individuals or businesses, but they must justify their decisions quantitatively and objectively, he said.<br />“This is just a nondiscrimination principle,” he said. “If you’re not going to serve somebody for a service that you have chosen to offer to others…then you have to do the homework and show why this person is risky.”</td>

      <td>Even with rising Covid cases and renewed lockdowns, the country maintains stubborn allure</td>
      <td>MILLIONS OF American and other foreign tourists are flocking to Mexico, but they’re drawn by more than warm weather, beaches and cultural and culinary abundance. Mexico has been liberal about admitting tourists without proof of negative Covid tests or quarantine requirements at a time when places from New York to Europe to Asia have blocked or restricted pandemic travel.<br />Though it offers travelers a respite from cold and monotony, Mexico’s policy holds risks for foreigners and locals alike. Over the past week, Mexico has registered an average of nearly 13,000 Covid cases and almost 1,000 deaths a day from the virus, or about 107 deaths per 100,000 people. (By comparison, the U.S. reports 116.35 deaths per 100,000 and the U.K. 125.35 per 100,000). Evidence suggests that Mexico’s figures are undercounted. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns against travel to Mexico due to Covid and the U.S. State Department urges “increased caution in Mexico due to crime and kidnapping.” (Starting on Jan. 26, the U.S. government will require all international airline passengers to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test before boarding flights to the U.S., presenting a new hurdle for Americans arriving back from Mexico, which conducts relatively little testing.)<br />But so far, the warnings haven’t stopped people from coming. In December, Laura Hartman, a Manhattan dental-practice manager, traveled with her husband to the same all-inclusive Cozumel resort she’s been visiting annually for about eight years to scuba dive. While Ms. Hartman said she didn’t feel at risk, she noted some differences: fewer fellow guests, the closure of Cozumel’s annual Christmas fair, the ubiquitous protective masks on staff, and the absence of the giant cruise ships that normally crowd the coast. “That was the strangest thing on the landscape,” said Ms. Hartman, 56. “It was just sad. Mexico’s a poor country and without tourism [many local workers] can barely survive.”<br />The major cruise-ship companies, which canceled sailings to Mexico and elsewhere in March, hope to restart this year with testing for all passengers and crew before boarding, limited capacity and other curbs, according to their industry association.<br />About 25 million tourists visited Mexico in 2020, a 43% drop from the previous year, with the biggest decline happening in April. Arrivals and hotel occupancy rates have both gradually edged up since then. Cancún, whose airport received the most tourists in 2020, is again among  Expedia ’s  most-searched destinations for 2021, along with other Caribbean beach resorts. Among them is Tulum, which hosted thousands of people for its Art With Me cultural festival in November. Paul Sarfati, founder of Bamba Travel, a Mexico City-based international tour operator, said a small hotel he owns with partners in Tulum has been nearly full, even in the normally slow period of September through November. “They’re partying there like there’s no Covid,” he said.</td>

He was only 54 years old at the time. He was one of the best football coaches on the planet. And he had a history of saying he was done only to quickly change his mind: He had stepped down as the head coach at Florida in 2009 only to come back months later and resign after the next season. Less than a year later, he came back again to coach Ohio State.<br />Now Urban Meyer is nearing another comeback—this time as the coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars.<br />It isn’t exactly surprising Meyer looks like he’s returning to the sidelines. What’s surprising is the place he chose. He’s betting the next stage of a career rich with championships on a franchise that has never won a Super Bowl and had the NFL’s worst record in 2020.</td>

      <td>Individual investors who recently piled into  GameStop Corp.  are taking a victory lap this week after shares of the struggling company surged more than 90% in the last two days, putting the stock on pace for its best weekly performance on record.<br />For weeks, members of Reddit’s popular WallStreetBets forum have been touting GameStop, encouraging others to scoop up shares of the videogame retailer and begin making bullish bets. Several posts on the forum had noted that short sellers’ bearish GameStop bets had been at elevated levels.<br />Short interest, which indicates the interest of investors betting a stock will fall in value, has hovered around 138% of the stock’s free float this year, FactSet data show. This makes it the second-most shorted company across the New York Stock Exchange and  Nasdaq Inc.,  according to Dow Jones Market Data. That had some Reddit users predicting that the stock might rapidly rise if short sellers suddenly had to cover their bets by buying back shares should the stock suddenly rise in value.<br />This week, that forecast finally appeared to take shape after news of changes to GameStop’s board sent shares climbing.<br />On Monday, the company said it had struck a deal to add  Chewy  Inc.  co-founder Ryan Cohen and two former executives to the GameStop board.</td>

      <td>The incitement case against him isn’t just the use of a few words he uttered before the assault by his followers on the Capitol but the conduct over an extended period leading up to his rally.</td>
      <td>Jeffrey Scott Shapiro’s recollections (“No, Trump Isn’t Guilty Of Incitement,” op-ed Jan. 11) of his own prior prosecutorial involvement with allegations of incitement are undoubtedly correct, but he ignores one significant distinguishing factor: He never had to deal with Donald Trump. The incitement case against him isn’t just the use of a few words he uttered before the assault by his followers on the Capitol but the conduct over an extended period leading up to his rally before the assault on the Capitol.<br />Context matters. President Trump had repetitively falsely stated, as he did again at his rally on Jan. 6, that the electoral results were fraudulent and that he (and therefore his followers) had been robbed of a legitimately elected presidency. He had urged his followers to come to Washington on Jan. 6 for a “wild” day. At the Trump rally itself, his lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, called on his followers to engage in “trial by combat,” and the president himself called on his followers to accompany him to the Capitol to combat the supposed “election theft” that he was “not going to let . . . happen” and for them “to show strength,” and “to be strong.” And as his supporters yelled out “fight for Trump,” his response was “we will not take it anymore . . . we will stop the steal.”<br />All this is the equivalent of waving a flock of red flags before a bull. The Supreme Court has admirably defined incitement narrowly to avoid stifling free speech, but like Mr. Shapiro it has never had an incitement case involving Donald Trump or Trump-like speech before it. We may yet hear from the court.<br />Floyd Abrams<br />New York</td>

      <td>There is a reason we arm our police.</td>
      <td>Sen. Tom Cotton (“Insurrection Demands Forceful Response,” op-ed, Jan. 8) is right when he says: “The best way to maintain or restore order is an overwhelming display of force, which often can prevent the use of force.“ However, he only alludes to an important issue when he deprecates the initial unarmed deployment of the National Guard.<br />There is a reason we arm our police. While the presence of an officer often deters illegal behavior, that presence is backed by the implicit threat of loss of life, liberty or treasure for those not conforming their behavior to civic norms. When peaceful demonstrations become riots, as defined by violence and the destruction of property, lethal force is justified.<br />A police officer facing a rioter wielding a brick or a baseball bat has reason to fear great bodily harm or death, and therefore has the right of self-defense to use lethal force. A person hurling a Molotov cocktail into a police station is, at the very least, showing depraved indifference to the lives of those inside, if not homicidal intent. He should be deterred by lethal force.<br />As Sen. Cotton points out, maintaining order is necessary “not only to protect . . . people from criminal violence but also to preserve confidence in civilization.” The surrender of a police station in Portland, Ore., taught the insurrectionists in Washington, D.C., that they could act with impunity. Our civilization needs the protection of lethal force.<br />John M. Peterson</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden intends to select Jaime Harrison, a former Senate candidate in South Carolina and a rising star in the party, to lead the Democratic National Committee, people familiar with the plans said Thursday.<br />Mr. Harrison, a former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, raised $133 million for his unsuccessful 2020 bid against Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.). As DNC chair, he will be tasked with helping the party defend gubernatorial candidates and protect its House and Senate majorities in next year’s midterm elections.<br />Mr. Harrison’s selection to lead the DNC, first reported by the New York Times, was expected to be announced later Thursday. One of the people familiar with the plans said Mr. Biden intended to install three allies as DNC vice chairs: Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Rep. Filemon Vela (D., Texas). Another person familiar with the plans said he also intends to tap Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D., Ill.) as a vice chair.<br />New presidents typically choose the leadership of the party committee. Mr. Harrison sought the chairmanship of the DNC in 2017 at the start of the Trump administration, but DNC members chose former Labor Secretary Tom Perez.<br />Party officials noted that Mr. Biden’s campaign worked closely with the DNC during the campaign and expected Mr. Harrison’s selection to enhance that partnership. Mr. Biden has long maintained ties to South Carolina, and voters in the state were instrumental in his comeback during the 2020 primaries.</td>

      <td>Chip giant’s next leader brings engineering background, Christian faith to company confronting array of challenges</td>
      <td>Intel Corp.’s  incoming Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger once described himself as the chip giant’s “chief geek”—a role he might need to resume as he seeks to revive the company’s prospects and rebuild its technological prowess.<br />The 59-year-old is both an obvious choice to lead America’s most iconic semiconductor company—he spent 30 years there earlier in his career—and a somewhat unorthodox appointment for a modern chief executive who wrote a book on work-life balance and developed a points system to help himself avoid staying late at the office.<br />Intel on Wednesday named the Pennsylvania-farm-boy-turned-engineer to succeed ousted CEO Bob Swan next month. The appointment marks a turning point for Intel as it battles market-share losses and weighs its strategic direction, including whether to remain both a designer and maker of chips when most rivals have specialized in one or the other.<br />Mr. Gelsinger brings the kind of engineering background common at Intel, one of Silicon Valley’s pillars. Mr. Swan, a former financial chief, was only the second CEO in the company’s 52-year history not to have a technical background. He remains in his role until Feb. 15.<br />François Piednoël, a former Intel engineer who has criticized the company’s technical decisions and whose career at the chip maker overlapped with Mr. Gelsinger’s, called the new chief a good listener who understood technical problems and made informed decisions. “He is very good at building his confidence by seeking the experts’ opinions,” he said.</td>

      <td>Startups around the country are looking to lighten the burden on landfills by offering takeout in reusable containers. Will consumers get on board?</td>
      <td>LIKE MOST New Yorkers, Adam Farbiarz relies on restaurant takeout. But he doesn’t like all the packaging that comes with it.<br />Most of us simply sigh over the waste and move on. But in late 2019, Mr. Farbiarz and two partners launched DeliverZero, an online platform that lets customers order from restaurants that offer reusable containers, then return them to the delivery person the next time they order. The network began with five restaurants, all in Mr. Farbiarz’s Brooklyn neighborhood. A year later, the company had 120 restaurants throughout New York City and a backlog waiting to join.<br />DeliverZero is one of a number of startups that have set out to tackle restaurant waste. The boomlet is happening mostly in eco-conscious cities including San Francisco, Portland, Ore., and Durham, N.C. But Loop, a refillable packaging initiative from the recycling company TerraCycle, is launching pilots this year with chains such as  McDonald’s  in the U.K., Tim Hortons in Canada and Burger King in the U.S.<br />The efforts reflect a growing awareness among consumers about the problem of waste, in particular, plastics. According to the Overbrook Foundation, which supports organizations devoted to environmental conservation, 561 billion disposable items are used each year in the U.S. Meanwhile, the EPA reports that only 8.5% of plastic is recycled. And that was before the pandemic.<br />Stay-at-home orders—along with federal guidance to restaurants to use disposable plates and packaging—have only intensified the problem. Waste numbers for 2020 are not yet available, but the market for U.S. food delivery in 2020 is expected to add up to $44 billion, a nearly 42% jump over 2019. It’s a safe bet that millions of extra takeout containers have hit the trash. “The problem is so in your face,” Mr. Farbiarz said. “Every time you order, you get all this garbage.”</td>

Cisco disputed that claim and sued Acacia in Delaware Chancery Court to compel the Maynard, Mass.-based company to close the transaction under its previous terms.<br />A spokeswoman for Cisco said the company plans to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit Thursday.<br />Acacia executives said on a call Monday that since the initial agreement was announced, the company has benefited from stronger demand from some customer groups as well as improvements in its product portfolio and relationships with existing customers.

      <td>Carnival’s investors headed for the lifeboats, but this company is more buoyant than it looks.<br />The cruise line released preliminary fourth-quarter results on Monday that did little to resuscitate its tattered share price. The company said it expects to post a loss of more than $2 billion for the quarter as it burned through an average of $500 million in cash a month.<br />Carnival Corp.’s shares are now down nearly 58% over the last 12 months, making it the worst performer of the three major cruise lines over that period. At this price, investors should play the long game. Carnival said on Monday that bookings for the first half of 2022 were ahead of those in the same period of 2019, indicating that demand can return to at least pre-pandemic levels. Carnival will be there to welcome cruisers on board: It said that it ended 2020 with $9.5 billion in cash and that it has enough liquidity in place to sustain its business even if it generates zero revenue this year.<br />Diving deeper into its booking numbers, the recovery looks even better. Carnival’s total capacity for 2022 relative to 2019 will grow by less than 2%, net of ships disposed of and acquired, according to UBS analyst Robin Farley. And Carnival said that 2019 was a very strong year with bookings at the higher end of its historical ranges, making for an especially tough comparison.<br />Cruise-review site Cruise Critic, owned by Tripadvisor, says it has seen a 40% increase in cruise shoppers on its site this month thus far compared with last month. January marks the start of a three-month period those in the industry refer to as “wave season,” when cruise lines traditionally offer deals to encourage early bookings. Carnival also said that, as of Nov. 30, about 45% of its guests affected by schedule changes opted to receive future cruise credits rather than refunds. At least some of that committed occupancy wouldn’t have shown up yet as actual bookings.</td>

      <td>The suspense of OPEC and its partners’ strained meeting has been resolved, but there is still room for surprise from two countries outside that group</td>
      <td>Saudi Arabia’s decision to dramatically cut its oil output was a pleasant New Year’s surprise for energy investors. Developments in the world’s two largest economies could cut the party short.<br />The kingdom’s move has helped send front-month Brent crude oil prices up by 7% in two weeks to above $55 a barrel. The cut erases a substantial 1 million barrels a day of supply—about 1% of world demand—in February and March, as the market still faces uncertain oil demand with surging Covid-19 cases.<br />The operating assumption is that any drag on demand will be short-lived and that other producers remain chastened by 2020’s price crash. A report released by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Thursday is encouraging: After reducing its 2021 oil demand forecast in the past four consecutive reports, the latest one kept its December estimate. It expects demand to increase by 5.9 million barrels a day from 2020 to average 95.9 million barrels a day. It has also kept its oil supply forecast largely unchanged.<br />But wild cards still remain in the form of two formidable oil players: the U.S. and China. They are crude oil’s largest consumers and the former was the largest producer of oil in 2019, topping Saudi Arabia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.<br />OPEC notes in its report that market conditions have improved for U.S. shale drillers, yet the cartel revised its U.S. supply forecast up by only 0.1 million barrels a day. The actual number could well swing higher. Plenty of U.S. companies have signaled discipline. Experience has shown, though, that those promises are hard to keep when oil prices are high and capital markets are friendly. A broad basket of energy exploration companies has gained almost 22% this year and interest rates remain very low.  Goldman Sachs ,   Morgan Stanley  and other brokers have upgraded their ratings on  Exxon Mobil ,  for example.</td>

      <td>Trump committed the sort of offense the Founders had in mind, but this isn’t the Congress they wanted.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump’s presidency has visited unique miseries on U.S. governance, some of his making and many the doings of his opponents. But his parting infliction of chaos is the most illuminating.<br />The key is to understand the nature of President Trump’s offense, and precisely why the Senate may yet find it difficult to convict him for it despite Wednesday’s impeachment in the House. The offense for which he is almost certainly impeachable was the speech he gave the day of the Capitol Hill riot that incited a mob to obstruct Congress’s deliberations.<br />This must be the closest a president has ever come to the sort of infraction the Founders had in mind when they wrote the impeachment clause. Much of their political thought was stimulated by the English Civil War of the 1640s, sparked by Parliament’s attempts to defend its privileges against King Charles I (whose head parliamentarians ultimately claimed). That conflict between crown and Parliament has preoccupied English-language political philosophy ever since. Less time separated America’s founding generation from those events than now stands between us and the founding.<br />But what will Congress do about it? The Founders provided for political impeachment and conviction as the remedies for a dangerous executive. But to work, the mechanism requires a legislative branch deeply invested in and jealous of its powers and prepared to go to the political mat to defend them.<br />No wonder the current impeachment drive may falter, since today’s Congress is anything but protective of its unique institutional role. The House speaker who pushed forward impeachment this week is the same Nancy Pelosi who famously admitted in 2010 that Congress would have to pass the Affordable Care Act “so you can find out what’s in it.” Whatever figurative point she thought she was making, the statement was literally true: Most of what Congress did was hand executive agencies vague instructions to write new regulations, the full content of which would be as much of a surprise to legislators as anyone else.</td>

      <td>William Burns will rein in intelligence with an outsider’s touch.</td>
      <td>President-elect Biden has selected veteran diplomat William Burns as his nominee for director of the Central Intelligence Agency. This is a good choice—an experienced and highly respected national-security expert. He will be an asset to Mr. Biden and could help restore bipartisan confidence in the agency he leads.<br />I write as a 19-year CIA veteran and a supporter of President Trump. I’m critical of Mr. Biden’s other picks for top national-security posts, most of who are unremarkable former Obama officials. But Mr. Burns served for 33 years in the Foreign Service and eventually was ambassador to Russia and deputy secretary of state. He also was a trusted aide to several secretaries of state in Republican and Democratic administrations. He has written critically of President Trump and his foreign policy, but he has avoided the harsh anti-Trump partisanship of many career national security officials over the past four years.<br />With the selection of Mr. Burns, Mr. Biden shined light on two key issues in the national-security world. First, to be truly accountable to the American people and the president, the CIA needs to be led by an outsider. Although many CIA officers will be disappointed that one of their own didn’t get the nod, Mr. Burns is well-known by the CIA workforce and will be well received.<br />Second, Mr. Biden and his advisers appear to recognize that the intelligence community has lost public trust after years of politicizing intelligence, meddling in domestic politics, and violating the electronic privacy of Americans. The so-called whistleblower who initiated Mr. Trump’s impeachment in 2019, and the continuous spiteful criticism of Mr. Trump by former CIA Director John Brennan, undermined the agency’s reputation as a nonpartisan institution. This was no time to reward a Biden insider with the agency’s top job.<br />The CIA needs a housecleaning to perform as a less political, more effective intelligence organization. I don’t know how much leeway the Biden White House will give Mr. Burns to hire and fire throughout the agency’s ranks, but I believe he will press his boss to allow him to make several long-overdue organizational reforms.</td>

While Mr. McConnell has signaled he is open to convicting Mr. Trump for his statements before last week’s attack on the Capitol, he said the trial won’t conclude until after Mr. Trump leaves office.<br />“Even if the Senate process were to begin this week and move promptly, no final verdict would be reached until after President Trump had left office,” Mr. McConnell said Wednesday.<br />An impeachment trial for the outgoing president at the beginning of Mr. Biden’s term will create a logistical challenge for Democrats, who will take control of the Senate and seek to quickly confirm Mr. Biden’s nominees and pass another coronavirus relief bill. Last year’s trial in the first impeachment of Mr. Trump took several weeks, requiring senators to sit in their desks on the chamber’s floor, often until late into the night.<br />“I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation,” Mr. Biden said Wednesday.</td>

      <td>Lineup extends many selling points of previous launches, but base model sells for $200 less than last year’s version</td>
      <td>SEOUL— Samsung Electronics Co. ’s newest smartphones feature improved cameras, display functions for weary eyes and stylus compatibility.<br />But as global smartphone sales are projected to return to pre-coronavirus levels this year, the industry is trying to answer if the pandemic-weathered consumer will be satisfied with incremental improvements in technology and features. Samsung is betting the answer is yes.<br />The South Korean technology company introduced three new models of its Galaxy S21 phones on Thursday, hoping to gain ground on its sanctions-hobbled rival Huawei Technologies Co. and lift weaker sales of its flagship phones as global demand sputters back.<br />The most novel feature in Samsung’s new offerings may be the price: The base model Galaxy S21 model will retail for $799, or $200 cheaper than last year’s version. The S21+ will cost $999, followed by the top-of-the-line S21 Ultra at $1,199.<br />The smartphone market is still recuperating from the economic fallout of the pandemic, which briefly closed retail stores and caused people to delay buying new devices, analysts say. That helped push the average length of time consumers owned their smartphone to around three years, according to market-tracking firm Strategy Analytics, and overall smartphone sales slumped 20% in the first half of 2020.</td>

      <td>In a Seattle home, a designer brokers a peace between a couple’s warring tastes without compromising style</td>
      <td>I LIKE THINGS that have a little bit of tension,” said interior designer Heidi Caillier. This passion for clashes made her the ideal partner for Jacob Meyer and Margaret Lacy Meyer, a couple with disparate tastes who asked her to help mastermind a renovation of their five-bedroom Craftsman-inflected house in Seattle’s Seward Park neighborhood.<br />Ms. Lacy Meyer, a psychotherapist from Milwaukee, favors clean midcentury modern design and bold accents, coupled with an earthier West Coast palette. “I’m not a traditionalist,” she said. Her chemist husband, born in rural Gibson, La., is drawn to the dark wood and ornament seen in British décor or—closer to home—the 18th-century Georgian aesthetic that was popular in the American South. “He likes a lot going on,” said Ms. Lacy Meyer of her husband’s design preferences.<br />Ms. Caillier first created a base of smoky greens and creams, plenty of warm wood, brushed brass and nubbly natural textiles—elements that could engage either client’s taste. She next layered in traditional elements to meet Mr. Meyer’s love of intricacy halfway—but with a modern twist. The formality of the wainscoting in the living and dining rooms, for example, was undercut with a solid wash of an unorthodox shade, Farrow & Ball’s Red Earth. His wife approved.<br />In decorating other rooms, Ms. Caillier layered furniture and finishes from different eras. In the bedroom of one boy (the family includes three under age 8), whimsical contemporary wallpaper and a bright yellow side table help a heavy Victorian Eastlake bed, which might seem too stodgy for a child of 5, skew youthful. Here, a room-to-room look inside the designer’s playbook.<br />Ms. Caillier smattered Delft-like tiles into the backsplash as a modern take on a classic Dutch look. The hand-painted pieces, by BDDW, actually skew American, with imagery of such Western troublemakers as cowboys, hunters and grizzly bears. Bar stools with molded-walnut seats—very Eames-like—offset more-historic elements, like the Shaker-tinged cabinets. Roman and Williams Guild’s pendants straddle sensibilities: The shape’s a little midcentury, but the rich patina, ribbed collar and form of the glass don’t feel super-modern, said Ms. Caillier.</td>

      <td>In the 18th century, a new Protestant belief that people have control over their destinies fostered the rise of free-market ideas.</td>
      <td>The conventional account of modern thinking about economics starts with Adam Smith’s 1776 book “The Wealth of Nations.” Smith’s insights, in turn, are usually said to be a product of the secularism of the Enlightenment—a historic turn from thinking in terms of a God-centered universe toward ideals of human rationality and self-sufficiency.<br />But that story is seriously incomplete. In fact, our modern Western understanding of market competition as the key to economic progress owes a great deal to religion—specifically, the new ideas that emerged in the English-speaking Protestant world in the late 17th and the 18th century. Critics of capitalism sometimes complain that the belief in competitive markets, among economists and many ordinary citizens too, is a form of religion. There is something to the idea, though not in the way the critics mean.<br />The idea that there is a connection between religion and capitalism isn’t new. The German sociologist Max Weber famously argued that religious belief had been an important spur to the growth of capitalism. Weber pointed in particular to the Calvinist notion of predestination—the belief that God decided whether each individual would be saved or damned before the person was even born. Driven by anxiety over their ultimate fate, Weber theorized, believers sought to convince themselves that they were among God’s “elect” by displaying virtues like thrift, industriousness and individual initiative. In this way, a “Protestant ethic” emerged that enabled the rise of modern capitalism.<br />For purposes of economic thinking, however, Weber had things exactly backward. Belief in predestination actually hindered the emergence of modern capitalism’s key idea—that human beings can rationally advance their own and others’ economic condition. After all, if it was impossible for individuals to make any choice or take any action to promote their ultimate spiritual prospects, how could they make choices or take action to improve their well-being in this world?<br />By Adam Smith’s time, however, Protestant thought had turned away from the idea of predestination. The English and Scottish clergy began to preach instead that men and women are endowed with reason and that human character is inherently good. John Tillotson, the Archbishop of Canterbury in the late 17th century, argued that far from being predestined to heaven or hell, people can “cooperate” with God in effecting their salvation. As the philosopher John Locke put it in a famous metaphor, people have “the candle of the Lord” by which to see and then act.</td>

      <td>Men’s champion Nathan Chen aims to win his fifth crown, but ladies champion will likely change as Alysa Liu adjusts to a changing body</td>
      <td>Physiologists who study the effects of puberty on athletic performance sometimes suggest that elite performers sit out the season when they’re undergoing a growth spurt, to reduce the risk of injury from high-intensity training or jarred confidence from the pressure of adjusting to a changing body under a spotlight.<br />Alysa Liu, the 15-year-old 2019 and 2020 U.S. ladies figure skating champion anointed by many as the next big American hope, isn’t doing that. But the skating season she’s participating in has been so pared back because of the novel coronavirus that it’s almost as if she did.<br />Liu will appear in the contest for the ladies’ national title on Thursday and Friday, with men’s champion Nathan Chen pursuing his fifth crown on Saturday and Sunday. They will perform before cardboard cutouts of fans and canned recordings of applause in the same near-empty arena in Las Vegas where the only other two in-person U.S. national competitions of the season have taken place.<br />It’s also quite possibly the last competitive outing they’ll have before the next season, which happens to include the 2022 Olympic Games. Almost all of the international competitive calendar has been shredded.<br />Only the hosts of the 2021 world championships, scheduled for Stockholm, Sweden in March, insist they’re still going ahead, but they haven’t described their plans for making the event safe yet. Some countries may balk at sending their skaters, even though technically it’s a qualification opportunity for the Games.</td>

      <td>LIKE MANY of the dishes at Balkan Treat Box in Webster Groves, Mo., lahmacun is Turkish in origin. This recipe for the flatbread—typically topped with minced beef or lamb—is also rooted deep in the story of the restaurant’s owners, Loryn and Edo Nalic. As a child Mr. Nalic fled his native Bosnia and the war that tore it apart in the 1990s, moving around Europe with his family for years afterward. While living in a Turkish neighborhood in Germany, he fell hard for lahmacun.<br />Ms. Nalic's second Slow Food Fast recipe honors her husband’s childhood favorite but swaps in minced cauliflower for the meat topping. “It works amazingly,” the chef said. “When cauliflower is caramelized, its sugars come out and it turns extra meaty.” She serves it with sumac-spiced onions, yogurt and lemon wedges. At the restaurant she makes her dough from scratch, but substituting pita makes this incredibly easy to pull off at home.<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

      <td>The recorded death count from the Covid-19 pandemic as of Thursday is nearing 2 million. The true extent is far worse.<br />More than 2.8 million people have lost their lives due to the pandemic, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from 59 countries and jurisdictions. This tally offers the most comprehensive view yet of the pandemic’s global impact. Deaths in these places last year surged more than 12% above average levels.<br />Less than two-thirds of that surge has been attributed directly to Covid-19. Public-health experts believe that many, if not most, of the additional deaths were directly linked to the disease, particularly early in the pandemic when testing was sparse. Some of those excess deaths came from indirect fallout, from health-care disruptions, people avoiding the hospital and other issues.<br />To better understand the pandemic’s global toll, the Journal compiled the most recent available data on deaths from all causes from countries with available records. These countries together account for roughly one-quarter of the world’s population but about three-quarters of all reported deaths from Covid-19 through late last year.<br />The tally found more than 821,000 additional deaths that aren’t accounted for in governments’ official Covid-19 death counts.</td>

      <td>After a monumental trade, a trio grows in the New York City outer borough</td>
      <td>The Brooklyn Nets beat the New York Knicks Wednesday, but that was merely the fine print—the headline happened earlier, in the late afternoon, when word arrived that the Nets acquired the hirsute scoring maestro James Harden from the Houston Rockets in a deal involving four teams, a handful of players, and a flurry of draft picks and “pick swaps” that effectively give Houston the option to pluck Brooklyn’s future for much of the next decade.<br />Basically, as I understand it, if anything new or interesting happens in Brooklyn, on or off the court, for the next bunch of years—in sports, art, music, food, business, politics, real estate—it must now be sent off to Houston, stat.<br />This was apparently the prerequisite to get Harden, and the Nets believe he is worth it, because NBA teams live in the moment, and not in the year 2027. Who knows what 2027 holds, anyway? We could all be living in lunar colonies, or underwater sea caves, annexed to Newfoundland, or Elon Musk.<br />These Nets are especially urgent, because they employ Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, wondrous if fickle polymaths who have shown a willingness to move on if they feel the situation isn’t right. Irving has already stepped away—he’s taking unscheduled time off, popping up on social media videos and a meeting with a Manhattan district attorney candidate, for reasons that have yet to be explained. He isn’t saying why, and neither is the newbie Nets coach, Steve Nash, which makes the whole thing a bit awkward. The hope is Irving will eventually wander in through the out door and return to being one of the most electric point guards to ever do it, which frankly, he is. For now, who knows? C’est la vie avec Kyrie Irving.<br />As for Harden, it’s unclear what version of his talent Brooklyn is welcoming. The version that puttered into the 2020-21 season in Houston seemed disinterested and not exactly in peak fitness. (In fairness, so did I.) Clearly Harden, a virtuoso of angles and shot-making who plays like a combination of George Gervin and Fast Eddie Felson, could pour it in if you made him carry around rocks in a backpack. (He’s at 24.8 points per game this season.) His defense, however, is a mirage, and his commitment in Houston had become so lacking his recently-acquired Rockets teammate, DeMarcus Cousins, blasted him as “disrespectful”—the new guy in town, calling out the franchise star.</td>

However, workers are filing nearly four times more applications than they typically did in the first two months of 2020, and still higher than in any other recession on record.</td>

      <td>Semiconductor companies are asking their customers for patience as the industry works through a sharp increase in demand from makers of everything from cars to consumer electronics.<br />The chip shortage has caused prices to rise for certain semiconductors, delays in filling orders and auto makers to idle factories. If the problems persist, consumers may see delays in getting new cars and some electronic devices, and possibly higher prices.<br />There is no quick fix to the situation, either. Adding new chip-making machinery can be expensive and slow, and some of the deepest supply problems are taking place with older production lines that are less lucrative for manufacturers.<br />“In the whole semiconductor industry there is very little [spare] capacity right now—everything is doing well,” said Risto Puhakka, president of VLSIresearch, an industry-analysis firm. “We’re coming off a record investment year, and the demand continues to grow.”<br />The shortages add to the upheaval currently affecting the semiconductor industry. Intel Corp. this week ousted its chief executive, Bob Swan, after product delays, and mobile-phone chip giant Qualcomm Inc. added to a deal-making frenzy.</td>

Some Republicans who opposed impeachment have publicly criticized the president, with a handful suggesting the party must break free of his influence to regain power in Washington. Many in the party are smarting over losing control of both the White House and Senate in the last election.<br />Many others in the GOP are sticking by him, to varying degrees. More than 140 House Republicans objected to certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s election win after the riot.<br />In this GOP-leaning suburb of Charleston, represented by freshman Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, some of the party’s voters said they still back Mr. Trump. They condemned the mob in Washington last week but—unlike Ms. Mace—said the president wasn’t responsible for the actions of those supporters.<br />“Right now, Republicans across the board are weak,” said Gary Simons, a Republican.  He said he opposed the violence on Jan. 6, but he thought Mr. Trump was right to challenge the November election results, saying it was “what the people needed him to do.” He said he had expected more Republicans would object to certifying Mr. Biden’s win.</td>

      <td>At this year’s virtual tech extravaganza, a new wave of home tech aims to blend in, not stand out</td>
      <td>CES is an all-virtual, pared-down affair this year, featuring new versions of many usual suspects. So far, we’ve seen filmmaking drones, dishwashing robots, rollable phones and other kinds of gadgetry ranging from clever to crazy. The annual conference’s main value proposition is that it offers a little glimpse into the future—yet the most compelling new smart-home gadgets don’t look futuristic at all.<br />That’s precisely what I’m excited about: tech that is at its best when it just blends into the woodwork, sometimes literally.<br />There’s a device to make any coffee table a wireless charging station, a standard-looking deadbolt lock that unlocks with a touch, a bed with a disappearing, transparent TV, and a faucet that can dispense exactly two tablespoons of water on command. My personal favorite—a toilet with a lid that automatically opens as you approach and closes when you walk away—solves one of the longest, ongoing quarrels in my home.<br />Living with technology can often mean a mess of different cables, apps, adapters, remotes and confusing interfaces. Gadgets that can tuck themselves away or have hidden smarts, unlocked with a word or a hand wave, are an especially nice idea, especially now that we’ve been spending more time at home.<br />A hidden wireless Qi charger, called UTS-1, can be mounted to the underside of a nonmetallic surface using the included tape. Plug it into the wall, and you’ve just added wireless charging to your furniture. It keeps your desk tidy and prevents your housemates from stealing your charger.</td>

That brought the airline’s 2020 losses to nearly $12.4 billion, making it the company’s worst year ever and marking its first annual loss since 2009.<br />The industry remains in dire straits. The months after the December holidays are typically the weakest for airlines, which have already been battered by 10 months of a pandemic that nearly obliterated appetite for travel.<br />Now Covid-19 cases are surging, with daily fatalities in the U.S. hitting new records. The early stages of vaccine distribution, meanwhile, have been slower than expected and officials have implemented renewed travel restrictions in many parts of the world in response to new coronavirus strains that are potentially more contagious.<br />U.S. air-passenger volumes briefly swelled during Christmas and New Year’s, hitting a pandemic high of more than 1.3 million people streaming through airport security screening checkpoints on Jan. 3. But the numbers have quickly dropped off and are down about 60% from a year ago.</td>

He added that the intrusion was isolated and that the hack didn’t affect the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, nor did it spread to other agencies within the department.<br />“The public can have total confidence in the data that BLS has,” he said. He added that the department determined that none of the bureau’s data was “exfiltrated,” or transferred from the bureau’s systems. “No data was lost or corrupted,” Mr. Scalia said.<br />U.S. officials and cybersecurity experts have characterized the attack as a cyber-espionage campaign, not one intended to damage computer systems.<br />Mr. Scalia became labor secretary in September 2019. He previously worked as a corporate-regulation and labor-law attorney. In the interview he discussed his concerns with the unemployment-insurance system, the transition to the Biden administration and the need to protect democracy in the wake of the Capitol riot. He declined to comment on impeachment proceedings or calls to remove President Trump from office. He is expected to step down as labor secretary when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated Jan. 20.</td>

      <td>Global appetite for oil will remain subdued in the first quarter of 2021 due to coronavirus lockdown measures and rising infection rates, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said Thursday.<br />In its monthly report, OPEC maintained its forecast that world oil demand in 2021 won’t recover to the levels seen before the pandemic. Global demand took a 10% hit last year and the cartel expects it to rebound to 95.9 million barrels a day this year, but remain 4% below 2019 levels.<br />Despite the beginning of vaccination programs in recent weeks, rising infection rates in wealthy Western nations are continuing to stymie an economic recovery, OPEC said. In Europe, government restrictions are forecast to significantly hurt growth again in the first quarter of 2021, it added.<br />While the economic impact of the virus is continuing in richer Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, demand in large non-OECD nations such as China and India has recovered strongly. OPEC expects demand in non-OECD countries to increase by 3.3 million barrels a day in 2021.<br />Oil prices and equities have risen sharply in recent weeks, buoyed by vaccinations and Saudi Arabia’s announcement last week that it would unilaterally cut an additional one million barrels of daily oil production next month on top of the reductions already agreed on between OPEC and its allies.</td>

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , the world’s largest contract chip maker, is benefiting from a combination of surging demand, struggling competitors and top-notch technology. And it’s betting big on the future to keep that edge.<br />TSMC just logged another bumper quarter: Net profit for the three months ending in December rose 23% from a year earlier. That brought full-year profit to a record $17.6 billion, a 50% increase from 2019.<br />Strong demand has helped TSMC, which makes chips for companies like Apple and Nvidia. Stay-at-home demand has led to a boom in personal computers and servers used in data centers. Also, 5G smartphones and base stations added to chip demand.<br />TSMC has also sailed smoothly through the Trump administration’s ban on Huawei, previously an important customer. China only accounted for 6% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, compared with 22% a year earlier. Orders from Apple and Taiwanese chip company  MediaTek ,  which supplies many Chinese smartphone makers, probably helped to offset the blow.<br />The sudden jump in demand led to tight supply for chips throughout the year. Shortages have forced some car makers to delay production. TSMC’s revenue from the automotive sector grew 27% last quarter, though the segment only accounted for 3% of its revenue. The supply constraints have helped TSMC: The company managed to expand its net profit margin last quarter by 2.9 percentage points compared with a year earlier.</td>

Both landlord and tenant advocacy groups have lobbied heavily for more government rental assistance during the pandemic.<br />The survey, conducted by the Community Housing Improvement Program, a landlord trade group, focused on New York buildings subject to the city’s rent-regulation laws. These apartments account for about half of the city’s total rental apartments. Tallying responses from landlords, the group estimated that as many as 185,000 households living in these apartments are more than two months behind on rent, with an average debt of more than $6,000.<br />Jay Martin, executive director of CHIP, said rent debt from the rest of New York’s apartment inventory is probably the same or greater, meaning the total debt New York City renters are carrying is likely more than $2 billion.<br />“It’s not an insurmountable amount,” Mr. Martin said. “The numbers tell us that, probably, if we could get an additional billion or two dollars in the city, we could probably pay off every single renter’s arrears in the entire city of New York over the last year of the crisis.”</td>

      <td><br />2020 was a whiplash kind of year for U.S. banks. When the firms start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week, investors will want to know if they should expect another.<br />The spring and summer of 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic first started to ravage the U.S. economy, looked bad for banks. Profits plunged as they set aside money for bad loans. So did their stock prices. But by the fall, things had improved. Strong mortgage demand, healthy trading revenue and an economy kept afloat by generous government stimulus helped insulate the banks from a worst-case scenario.<br />What isn’t clear now is how long those boosters can last.<br />“The fourth quarter is going to be messy,” KBW analyst Brian Klock said. “But the real focus is going to be what 2021 is going to look like.”</td>

      <td>Leveraged-loan funds are attracting cash after two years in Wall Street’s doghouse</td>
      <td>Investors wary of lofty stock valuations and falling bond prices are turning to an unexpected haven: corporate loans with junk credit ratings.<br />Prices of the loans rose in recent sessions even when equities declined, and an index of the debt has returned about 1% this year—far outstripping the 0.03% delivered by junk bonds and the 2% loss posted by U.S. Treasurys.<br />Investors this month have funneled about $740 million into mutual and exchange-traded funds that specialize in the loans, according to EPFR Global Data. If the trend continues throughout January it would mark the first month of net inflows since September 2018.<br />The $1.2 trillion market for loans with below-investment grade credit ratings has been out of favor with individual investors for years and lagged behind the “everything rally” that lifted most markets to records in 2020. That gives the loans more potential upside than most Wall Street offerings in the year to come, fund managers said.<br />“I think we’re about to see a lot of demand for loans,” said Gershon Distenfeld, co-head of fixed income at  AllianceBernstein Holding  LP. The firm’s funds that specialize in high-yield bonds increased holdings of the so-called leveraged loans to about 10% in recent months from a historical average of around 4%.</td>

The allegations prompted monthslong protests in which millions of South Koreans took to the streets demanding Ms. Park’s resignation. Ms. Park was impeached in late 2016 and removed from office the following year.<br />The corruption scandal involving Ms. Park put a spotlight on the traditionally close ties between the government and family-run corporations, known as chaebols, that dominate the economy. The investigation shook the country’s political and business establishments, leading to public hearings and the jailing of prominent figures like Samsung’s de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong.<br />Mr. Lee, the grandson of Samsung’s founder, was convicted on charges including bribery and embezzlement in 2017. He was released from jail the following year on a suspended sentence and is expecting a retrial ruling on his case next week.</td>

It went missing at 2:40 p.m.<br />Divers and search crew located debris from the plane and human remains around an area known as the Thousand Islands, to the north of Jakarta. There were no survivors.<br />Investigators are counting on the so-called black boxes of the Boeing 737-500 to help piece together what happened in the moments before the crash and determine why SJ182 went down. One black box—the flight-data recorder—has been pulled out of the sea.</td>

The rest of the 15-member delegation arrived on Thursday as planned in Wuhan, the original center of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The early snag adds a further complication to a mission already fraught with political sensitivities, as Beijing has waged a broad campaign to cast doubt on the origins of a pathogen that was first discovered in central China. The WHO and Beijing have spent months negotiating the terms of the mission, which has been delayed several times, and the United Nations agency’s researchers say they don’t have a clear understanding of the progress that Chinese scientists have made in what is meant to be a collaborative effort.<br />Chinese state media reported on the WHO delegation’s Thursday arrival in Wuhan, without giving details about its composition.<br />The two WHO delegation members held up in Singapore tested negative for Covid-19 in swab tests, the people briefed on the matter said.</td>

Instead of flying northeast as expected, the plane veered northwest and at one point, a controller instructed the pilots to execute a turn to get back on track, one of these people said.<br />It is too early to draw definitive conclusions about the sequence of events before the crash that killed all 62 people on board, according to these people and safety experts not connected with the investigation. Indonesian authorities said the aircraft’s flight-data recorder, one of its so-called black boxes, was recovered by divers Tuesday and taken to a laboratory so its contents can be downloaded.<br />Authorities said they believe the location of the cockpit-voice recorder—which is the other black box—also has been identified, but rough seas prevented retrieval Wednesday.<br />For now, according to the safety experts, the crew’s lack of response on the radio could indicate pilot confusion or distraction. One possibility is that a problem with some mechanical or flight-control system could have consumed the pilots’ attention, they said.</td>

But by April, China’s factories were coming back online and retooling themselves to churn out medical and work-from-home computer equipment that filled shipping containers headed to Western countries then reeling from the pandemic.<br />Next, when Western countries began opening up their economies in the second half of the year, Chinese factories continued producing and shipping other goods abroad as demand for medical and computer equipment eased, defying months of market expectations that the exports boom would fade.</td>

While the actions might be justified in the current moment, he added, “over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet.”<br />Tech companies continue to roll out limits on Mr. Trump’s online options. Snapchat parent Snap Inc., which locked his account indefinitely last week, said Wednesday it would ban him permanently as of Jan. 20 in the interest of public safety and based on his attempts to spread misinformation and hate speech and to incite violence.<br />On Tuesday, YouTube suspended Mr. Trump’s channel. The video-sharing unit of  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google said it was locking the channel for at least seven days after the company removed videos it said violated its policies against content it believes could incite violence.<br />Facebook Inc.  last week suspended Mr. Trump indefinitely—at least through the rest of his term—and Twitter banned him permanently, after pro-Trump rioters invaded the U.S. Capitol and threatened lawmakers. Several other prominent technology companies have also taken steps to limit posts by Mr. Trump and others they feel may be inciting more violence.</td>

But unlike some smaller peers, Chesapeake came into bankruptcy with an exit proposal, supported by top lenders, already in place.<br />After approving the company’s plan during a virtual court hearing, Judge Jones addressed Chesapeake Chief Executive Robert Lawler directly, telling him “to remember that a lot of people have suffered a lot of pain for Chesapeake to have a second chance and I ask that you not forget that going forward.<br />“Chesapeake is a really big and important company. It’s an important company to our country’s infrastructure, it helps make everything work,” Judge Jones said. “But we live right now in a very, very difficult time and you have the ability to be a leader and to make a difference.”</td>

SlideBelts returned the $350,000 loan proceeds in July after multiple requests by the Small Business Administration, which administers the PPP.<br />Under SBA rules, companies under bankruptcy protection aren’t eligible to access the PPP, an enormously popular program of forgivable, government-guaranteed loans designed to keep checks flowing to Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />“The defendants made false statements to multiple banks in order to obtain a [PPP] loan that should have been disbursed to an honest small business suffering financially from the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic,” U.S. attorney McGregor W.

      <td>Federal regulators are asking  Tesla Inc.  to recall about 158,000 vehicles over safety concerns in what would amount to one of the biggest safety actions by the electric-vehicle maker.<br />The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked Tesla in a Jan. 13 letter to recall some Model S luxury sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles. NHTSA asked for the recall because the cars’ touch screens can fail after a few years of use, affecting safety functions on the vehicles like defogging and back-up cameras.<br />Some car recalls run into millions of vehicles. Though modest by historic numbers, the action would represent a relatively large recall for Tesla, which has far fewer cars on the road than some rivals. The Silicon Valley car maker delivered nearly 500,000 vehicles globally last year.<br />Tesla doesn’t have to recall the vehicles, though NHTSA said in the letter that if the car maker doesn’t take the action it has to provide an explanation for its decision. The agency can then escalate the matter to a public hearing and eventually seek to force a recall through the courts.<br />Tesla in 2018 recalled 123,000 Model S cars over a finding that cold weather could corrode some bolts, potentially leading to power-steering failures.</td>

      <td>Democrats rushed through their second impeachment of President Trump on Wednesday, with less than a week left before he exits the Oval Office. The exercise is mostly about making a political statement since it will have no other practical effect, though it might stir up more public anger and discord.<br />We’re on record as saying Mr. Trump committed an impeachable offense in inciting supporters to march on Congress with a goal of overturning the election as the electoral votes were counted. He may not have directly incited violence, but he still promoted an assault on the democratic transfer of power.<br />Mr. Trump was so self-deluded that he seems to believe this was possible, and he encouraged his supporters to believe it too. Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell resisted at a crucial moment and saved the day.<br />Mr. Trump will soon be gone, Joe Biden will take power, yet Democrats are still preoccupied with Donald Trump. On Tuesday they issued an ultimatum to Mr. Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and depose Mr. Trump or they’d impeach. Mr. Pence rightly refused and on proper grounds: the 25th Amendment was meant for a President who is incapacitated. Only a single Republican voted for the gambit.<br />Then Wednesday Democrats sprinted to the floor to impeach: No hearings, no fact-finding, no chance for defense. To what end? One goal seems to be simply to tag him as the only President impeached twice and to declare that Mr. Trump’s actions are unacceptable. In that case the House vote should be enough. Everyone voted his conscience, and that should be the end of it.</td>

      <td>The White House counsel has the hardest job in America.</td>
      <td>With Donald Trump in his final presidential days, the hardest job in the world may be White House counsel. So here’s a note of thanks for Pat Cipollone, who is staying on the job when the easier route would be to resign to outside applause.<br />No one can predict what Mr. Trump will do in the next week, and he often ignores the advice of his lawyers while heeding the horrendous counsel of opportunists like Rudy Giuliani. Case in point: Mr. Trump’s apparent belief that Vice President Mike Pence could overturn the state Electoral College votes on Jan. 6.<br />Mr. Trump could continue to make bad decisions, such as pardoning himself as he leaves office. That would increase the odds that the Biden Justice Department would look for some charge to make against Mr. Trump to challenge the pardon in court. The case might travel up to the Supreme Court, which could put new limits on the capacious language of the Pardon Clause in the Constitution.<br />Mr. Trump did one good deed Wednesday in finally issuing a clear statement calling for no violent protests: “In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind. That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers.” Mr. Trump should say this again from the Oval Office, but whoever encouraged that statement did a public service.<br />Every official has to search his conscience amid Mr. Trump’s actions, and outside moral judgment is easy and often wrong. Many good people are trying to prevent more bad decisions.</td>

The Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit that investigates technology platforms, obtained the subpoena through an open records request and shared it with The Wall Street Journal.<br />Amazon declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Tong said the company has cooperated with the subpoena.<br />Connecticut has previously taken interest in the e-book business. In 2012, the U.S. Justice Department alleged in a civil antitrust lawsuit that five major publishers and  Apple Inc.  had worked together to raise e-book prices. Connecticut, along with Texas, led a similar legal effort by a group of states.</td>

      <td>How trust busters botched the Staples-Office Depot merger.</td>
      <td>Five years ago the Federal Trade Commission broke up the Staples- Office Depot  merger attempt. Its dubious complaint is worth revisiting now as Staples tries again to get hitched to Office Depot to compete with  Amazon .<br />Staples’s private-equity owner Sycamore Partners this week proposed to buy Office Depot for $2.1 billion—a song compared to the $6.3 billion deal the FTC killed. The FTC had complained the merger would effectively create an office-supply monopoly, narrowly defining the competitive market as large corporate contracts.<br />Amazon, the government argued, was merely a bit supplier to big businesses and its higher costs couldn’t possibly allow it to compete. Lol. As we argued at the time (“Protecting Big Business”), the FTC’s job is to protect consumers, not corporations. In any case Office Depot and Staples still faced plenty of competition from  Costco ,  Amazon and  Walmart .<br />Federal judge Emmet Sullivan agreed with the FTC and enjoined the merger. Sycamore then took Staples private. Both office-supply retailers have since closed hundreds of stores as more businesses and consumers have bought office supplies online. As more documents go digital, people need less ink, file folders, Post-it Notes, etc.<br />Their corporate business has also been gobbled by Amazon, which advertises that it serves 55 of the top Fortune 100 companies. Because of its scale, Amazon can charge lower prices. Hence Sycamore is now trying to rekindle the merger.</td>

Behold the masters of finance who plan to offer the modern version of such gifts—climate tribute.<br />The Institute of International Finance (IIF) has been circulating a draft statement titled “Financing a U.S. Transition to a Sustainable Low-Carbon Economy” among financial trade associations that it plans to present to the Biden Administration sometime after next week’s inauguration. We’ve seen a copy of the 12-page document, and it reads like a hostage plea.<br />“To help establish a shared vision on U.S. climate policy, the financial services industry seeks to engage with incoming administration leaders and members of Congress on a bipartisan basis,” IIF says. “By so doing, we hope to inform the policymaking process and demonstrate our willingness and capacity to support a common-sense transition to a more sustainable, and inclusive, low-carbon economy.” At your climate service, sirs.<br />IIF notes that “the financial services industry has been active on climate priorities for decades, helping to build an analytical, market-based foundation for quantifying, reporting and managing climate risks, and supporting new opportunities.”<br />IIF calls for a “common approach” to corporate sustainability disclosures that have been developed by outfits such as the Global Reporting Initiative, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (Sasb). Michael Bloomberg has bankrolled the latter two, and we’ve written about Sasb’s political standards.</td>

The new flagship vehicle is its largest to date and is roughly 56% larger than its predecessor fund, a $6.15 billion fund that closed in 2017.<br />The private-equity firm itself and some affiliated investors pledged $600 million to the flagship vehicle, or more than 6% of the main fund’s total.<br />New Mountain has refilled its fundraising tank just in time for an annual investment tradition at the firm. At the start of each year, it brings together its full investment team to actively debate which industries and subsectors of those industries they believe will yield the most attractive investment opportunities in the coming year and how they might evolve over the long term.<br />The exercise allows the firm to better respond to industry or economic shifts and move away from subsectors if they become less attractive, according to New Mountain founder and Chief Executive Steven Klinsky.</td>

      <td>He’s wrong to skip the inauguration, but he can still discourage any further violence.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump won’t be the first president to skip his successor’s inauguration.<br />The original boycotter was John Adams. After a vicious campaign, Adams left Washington at 4 a.m. on Inauguration Day, March 4, 1801, on the first stagecoach home to Massachusetts. Eight hours later, blue-coated militiamen snapped to attention and an artillery company fired a round as Thomas Jefferson emerged from his boarding house at New Jersey Avenue and C Street. The U.S. marshal for Maryland then walked Jefferson, members of Congress, foreign diplomats and local residents several hundred yards north to the Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony.<br />John Quincy Adams made inaugural absences a family tradition. In March 1829, he departed the White House the day before Andrew Jackson’s swearing-in. Like the 1800 election, the 1828 campaign was particularly nasty.<br />There are similarities between Mr. Trump and Andrew Johnson, the last president who refused to participate in marking the peaceful transfer of power. Though both were elected as Republicans, neither Mr. Trump nor Johnson, Abraham Lincoln’s running mate in 1864, was a longtime party member. Johnson was a Southern Democrat who opposed secession. Mr. Trump was a celebrity real-estate tycoon who had supported Republicans and Democrats.<br />Both Mr. Trump and Johnson had been impeached and acquitted. Mr. Trump faced charges of Russian collusion while Johnson was accused of violating the Tenure of Office Act, which required congressional approval to remove a cabinet member. Both impeachments were motivated largely by other factors: Democratic anger that Mr. Trump was elected, and Mr. Johnson’s opposition to congressional Republicans’ move to impose on the defeated South state governments dominated by men loyal to the union and black suffrage.</td>

      <td>James Harden, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving now play for the same NBA team.

The haul of draft equity heading to the Rockets reportedly includes Brooklyn’s unprotected first-round draft picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026, when Harden, Durant and Irving are no longer under contract, and the right to swap picks with the Nets in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027.<br />But wait. There’s more. Houston is also getting Victor Oladipo from the Indiana Pacers and another first-round pick in 2022 after expanding the deal to send Caris LeVert from the Nets to the Indiana Pacers and Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince to the Cleveland Cavaliers.<br />The dizzying trade during an especially chaotic week in the NBA involves four teams, four draft picks, four pick swaps and at least four intriguing players—and one huge bet from the Nets.</td>

      <td>Agencies are using the technology to identify the Capitol rioters.</td>
      <td>Federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies are using facial-recognition technology to identify the members of the mob that assaulted the U.S. Capitol last week.<br />Elsewhere, facial recognition and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used for nefarious purposes—including by China to persecute minorities and to identify Hong Kong dissidents.<br />We represent Clearview AI, the U.S. facial-recognition startup that became controversial a year ago when its existence came to light in the media. Clearview AI maintains a database of billions of publicly posted photographs that have been lawfully downloaded from the Internet, where users posted them on public websites, including social media. Clearview AI downloads photographs from the public internet that are available to any user from any computer around the world without the consent of the person photographed.<br />Licensed clients of Clearview AI—which are limited to law-enforcement agencies—can run a photo of an unidentified person through Clearview AI’s database for after-the-crime investigations. Clearview AI uses algorithms to create facial vectors, or “faceprints,” of the photo’s subject.<br />The question for policy makers is how to regulate this technology to allow its legitimate use and prevent abuse. A patchwork of state and local laws seek to restrict or even prohibit the use of biometrics, including faceprints. These are of dubious constitutionality, since the Supreme Court has made plain that “the creation and dissemination of information are speech within the meaning of the First Amendment.”</td>

      <td>Alphabet has no legal obligation to recognize or negotiate with the well-funded pressure group.</td>
      <td>The “union” formed by workers last week at Google parent company Alphabet isn’t really a labor union in the traditional sense. Rather it’s a pressure group funded by the Communications Workers of America, which will provide staff and support to generate negative publicity about management at the Mountain View, Calif., company. The so-called Alphabet Workers Union is composed of fewer than 800 workers among Alphabet’s roughly 250,000 employees and contractors, some of whom are technically employed by completely separate entities, some of which are already unionized.<br />The AWU describes itself as a “minority” or “members only” union, but such things are unlawful under federal labor law. Alphabet has no obligation to meet with, recognize or afford the AWU—or the CWA—any special rights. The group has no legal authority to bargain with Alphabet, and there is no reason the company should do so.<br />A real union has a democratic mandate, with a majority of employees voting to designate it their exclusive representative to bargain with their employer. Real unions represent a group of employees, with a true community of interest, bound by job location and classification and with legal standing to negotiate for better wages and working conditions.<br />The union movement in the U.S. arose to address workplace concerns far more pressing than the ones faced by Alphabet employees. For highly paid white-collar tech employees to co-opt the union label—while other workers still fight for safe workplaces, livable wages and essential benefits—is an insult to the American labor movement.<br />It is hardly surprising that the tech industry has shown little interest in a unionized workforce. Most tech workers are highly skilled and enjoy generous pay and benefits. The dangerous conditions and unfair work practices that unions were created to combat simply don’t exist in an environment where the average employee makes more than $250,000 and receives Cadillac health-care, tuition reimbursement and other benefits—including free food.</td>

      <td>For people who can control their impulses and regulate their emotions—so it is argued—the use of drugs, including heroin, can have good effects.</td>
      <td>In a referendum in November, Oregon became the first state to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and LSD. The move was inspired by a 2001 law in Portugal that removed incarceration as a penalty for drug possession. To judge by “Drug Use for Grown-Ups,” Carl Hart welcomed this news, which came too late for him to mention in his provocative and enlightening book. He opens with the announcement: “I am an unapologetic drug user.”<br />Mr. Hart, a professor of psychology and a neuroscientist at Columbia University, asserts that “recreational drugs can be used safely to enhance many vital human activities.” He bases his claim on decades of research on the behavioral and physiological effects of drugs in humans, coupled with his personal use. Thanks to drugs, he says, “I am a happier and better person.” He asks that we think about drugs in a more nuanced way, even at a time when opioid abuse is still headline news. Thus his book represents a calculated risk—namely, that by portraying drug use as so potentially rewarding for responsible users, it may inadvertently seduce non-grown-ups into hazardous use.<br />Mr. Hart reports that his views about drugs have evolved over the years. Growing up near Miami as a teen in the early 1980s, a city then overrun with crack cocaine, he saw drugs as a raging menace. In graduate school he began studying neuroscience. “If I could stop people from taking drugs, especially by fixing their broken brains,” he told himself, “I could fix the poverty and crime in my community.” In pursuit of this mission, he tried to prove the dangers of drug use. But over time he concluded that the marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine that he gave (with the approval of various ethics committees) to his subjects, themselves experienced drug users, was not as harmful as he had expected. No matter the drug, his subjects overwhelmingly said that they felt “more altruistic, empathetic, euphoric, focused, grateful, and tranquil.”<br />“Drug Use for Grown-Ups” has the soul of a manifesto. Mr. Hart wants to show us that “government bans on recreational drugs violate the spirit and promise of the nation’s founding document.” Putting it more personally, he writes: “It is my birthright to use substances in my pursuit of happiness.” Though a regular user of heroin, Mr. Hart says that he is “not an addict,” adding: “I have never failed to meet my obligations as a result of the drug or its effects.” The same is true for most other heroin users, he says, citing data showing that addiction affects only 10% to 30% of those who regularly use heroin and methamphetamine, among other drugs.<br />The alleged enslaving nature of drugs—you use it and you’re hooked—is one of many misperceptions that Mr. Hart tries to dispel. Each of his chapters presents a tutorial on the pharmacology and physiological effects of a particular class of drug, including opioids, amphetamines, psychedelics, cocaine and cannabis.</td>

      <td>Several members of the pro-Trump mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol last week have reported their own involvement to law enforcement this week, officials said Wednesday, as prosecutors race to charge dozens of the most visible participants in the attack and continue to dig into what kind of planning went into it.<br />Lawyers for several of the rioters have called law enforcement to disclose information about their clients’ participation in the breach in an effort to avoid more serious criminal charges and potentially negotiate plea deals, law-enforcement officials said.<br />In dozens of cases filed since the deadly riot, prosecutors have targeted some of the most visible participants whose efforts were broadcast widely on social media. They announced the arrest Wednesday of a Virginia man who was photographed on the scene wearing a sweatshirt bearing the words Camp Auschwitz. Among others arrested was a man from Idaho who was identified from photos showing him hanging by one hand from the Senate balcony.<br />The two men are charged with violent entry or disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, among other counts. The affidavit filed in support of the arrest of 56-year-old Robert Packer cites media reports that identified him as the man photographed in the sweatshirt referring to the Nazi concentration camp, and says an informant contacted law enforcement after recognizing him as a routine customer at a store in Newport News, Va. An attorney for Mr. Packer couldn’t be identified for comment.<br />The new cases come as Washington and cities across the country brace for the possibility of more armed protests and violence in the days before Joe Biden’s inauguration. Biden officials said Wednesday that the president-elect received a briefing from Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Secret Service officials to learn more about the threat picture and what plans are being assembled to thwart potential attacks.</td>

A tracker for user reports of false news surged to nearly 40,000 reports an hour, about four times recent daily peaks. On Instagram, the company’s popular photo-sharing platform, views skyrocketed for content from authors in “zero trust” countries, reflecting potential efforts at platform manipulation by entities overseas.<br />Facebook’s platforms were aflame, the documents show. One Instagram presentation, circulated internally and seen by the Journal, was subtitled “Why business as usual isn’t working.”<br />Company leaders feared a feedback loop, according to people familiar with the matter, in which the incendiary events in Washington riled up already on-edge social-media users—potentially leading to more strife in real life.<br />Facebook ultimately decided on a series of actions over the past week that, taken together, amount to its most aggressive interventions against President Trump and his supporters. And they show the company continuing to grapple with how best to police its platforms while still allowing for political discussion.</td>
