A wave of bankruptcies swept Midwestern farms, followed by trade disputes and the coronavirus pandemic, which deepened farmers’ struggles.</td>

      <td>JOHANNESBURG—Three new laboratory studies are raising concerns that the immune response triggered by a Covid-19 infection or vaccination may be less effective at protecting against the new strain of the coronavirus that first emerged in South Africa.<br />The findings come from experiments done in the laboratory and only look at certain elements of a body’s immune response. Still, they reinforce the possibility that vaccine makers and regulators will need to update Covid-19 vaccines as the virus evolves.<br />A fourth study, conducted by scientists at  BioNTech  SE and  Pfizer Inc.  and published by the companies, showed that their vaccine successfully neutralized a variant that was initially detected in the U.K. That study didn’t include the South African strain.<br />The U.K. variant has already spread to many other countries, including the U.S.<br />More than a year into the pandemic, the discovery of new variants that appear to have made the virus more contagious is forcing researchers to adapt their understanding of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. One concern, researchers said, is that the new strains are emerging in countries where a significant percentage of people have already built up an immune response to earlier variants after getting Covid-19.</td>

The Packers have been the NFC’s best team this year, while Rodgers has been the NFL’s best quarterback.<br />If the Buccaneers prevail, though, they’ll find themselves playing next in familiar confines: Raymond James Stadium, site of the Super Bowl on Feb. 7.

Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.), begins his two-year term at a time when men are playing higher-profile supporting roles in U.S. politics, as more women enter Congress and the highest levels of elected office.<br />For spouses, figuring out how to incorporate the demands of Congress into their family lives is an area where the club tries to provide support, Mr. Capito said. “The club does provide a forum for members because not everybody’s life is the same, but they sure do rhyme,” he said.<br />Mr. Capito’s ascension coincides with the arrival of more GOP husbands than ever before, trailing a tidal wave of Democratic women elected two years ago. A record-breaking 31 House Republican women, including two delegates, were sworn in this year. Eight GOP women are now serving in the Senate this year, following the departure of Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R., Ga.), who lost a runoff this month.</td>

Meanwhile, U.S.-China tensions have added to the uncertainty. As of Jan. 11, new investment in products tracking the Hang Seng became off-limits to American investors, due to a U.S. government block on investment in companies it says aid China’s military.<br />The blacklisted stocks include some Hang Seng constituents, such as  China Mobile Ltd. , and U.S. investors can’t buy funds that hold any shares in such companies.<br />In December, Hang Seng Indexes Co. began consulting on an overhaul. The index compiler—a unit of  Hang Seng Bank Ltd. , in turn majority owned by  HSBC Holdings  PLC—is collecting feedback on proposed changes, including increasing the index from 52 stocks to between 65 and 80.</td>

The teenage protester declined to comment.<br />Since November, at least 54 people have faced criminal complaints under the lèse-majesté law that prohibits any perceived insult to the Thai monarchy, according to the legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. A number of them have been summoned by police, setting investigations in motion, the group said.<br />Most of them are protesters who have changed Thailand’s political landscape in recent months by defying long-held social taboos and openly questioning the crown’s role and influence. The palace has traditionally held an almost sacred status in Thai society. But many in the new protest movement see the crown as part of the royalist-military elite that, they say, is holding back democratic progress in their country rocked by frequent coups and political turmoil.</td>

      <td>The Treasury selloff is about inflation expectations, not higher ‘real’ yields. Investors may need to adjust their old playbooks.</td>
      <td>Global investors have seized on the idea that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low as inflation rises. But they still need to fully figure out what this means for their portfolios.<br />On Thursday, the S&P 500 set another record. Markets have been emboldened by upbeat earnings, Covid-19 vaccinations and the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion fiscal-stimulus plan. But there is a puzzle: Optimism has also pushed up yields on 10-year U.S. government bonds to 1.1%, from 0.9% at the end of 2020, and investors often fear that this makes equities less attractive. Technology giants are seen as particularly vulnerable to rising rates, yet they are leading the charge once again.<br />An explanation is that inflation-protected Treasurys, or TIPS, haven’t sold off. This means the bond-market gyrations are all about inflation expectations rising well above pre-outbreak levels. In other words, the market is now convinced that, even if the Fed eventually raises rates, it will do so by less than inflation, keeping “real” financial conditions very loose.<br />For now, U.S. inflation remains low due to the pandemic, but is predicted to bounce back strongly. In the past, traders would have expected the Fed to pre-emptively try to cool the economy—in the immortal words of former Chairman William McChesney Martin in 1955, ordering “the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up.” Last year, though, officials committed to allowing inflation to run at a higher level for a while before taking action.<br />Various investment strategies have historically outperformed in periods of “reflation” or higher inflation. Buying gold is the most famous inflationary hedge, but has actually only been effective against sudden jumps in consumer prices—not the upward drift that many see as likely now. Stocks are better than bonds when costs rise, but still suffer as companies cannot always raise prices to maintain margins. Retailers, miners and energy firms tend to do better, whereas technology stocks struggle, as do utilities and other so-called bond proxies.</td>

      <td>The eurozone economy has suffered a weak start to the year, with high coronavirus infection rates and government restrictions increasing the risk of a second recession since the pandemic first struck last year.<br />Fresh Covid-19 outbreaks that authorities have struggled to contain are continuing to weigh on economic activity and have damped expectations for a strong global recovery in the first half, although the start of vaccination campaigns has raised hopes for a stronger rebound in the second.<br />In the early months of the year, a number of large economies face the threat of declining output as restaurants, cinemas and a wider range of businesses that involve close physical proximity are closed or have had their activities severely curtailed.<br />Data firm  IHS Markit  said its composite Purchasing Managers Index, which measures activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, for the eurozone fell to 47.5 in January from 49.1 in December. A reading below 50.0 points to a decline in activity.<br />A similar survey for Japan pointed to a bigger contraction in the services sector, while figures for the U.S. to be released later Friday are expected to point to a slowdown in the services recovery.</td>

      <td>Our wine columnist consults medical experts on the benefits that the comforting ritual of wine drinking can bring</td>
      <td>I’VE SPENT THE past few weeks reading the social-media accounts of friends and acquaintances touting their wineless state during Dry January, aka Dryuary (or even, awkwardly, Drynuary). Some have been taking a few days off alcohol during the week; others are spending an entire month alcohol-free. I haven’t joined them. My plan has been to drink wine in modest amounts with dinner every day in January, just as I do during the other eleven months of the year.<br />These decisions are highly personal, and I know that there are wine lovers for whom a period of abstinence can be a helpful way to manage a beverage that, for some, can lead to dependence and medical issues. You won’t be surprised to learn that a wine columnist isn’t part of a movement to forgo wine for an arbitrary period. I look forward to the comfort and pleasure of drinking wine with my meal every night. It’s a ritual my husband and I both enjoy, and I think there are benefits to maintaining the rituals that give shape to our days, especially during these turbulent times.<br />Dr. Jane Ogden, a professor of health psychology at the University of Surrey in the U.K., has written extensively on women’s health. She agreed there are good reasons to uphold rituals in stressful periods. “I think the most important thing at the moment is self care and being kind to yourself,” she wrote in an email. “If a routine glass of something helps, then that’s fine. It’s the bigger picture which is more important!” Yes, she included an exclamation point, which I took as further approbation of my vinous custom.<br />Dr. Ogden added that she thought Dry January proponents might actually be putting themselves at future risk. They might end up drinking even more in February when they return to “regular” consumption. “We call this the what-the-hell effect, or disinhibition,” she wrote. “Probably best to just drink in moderation all year round so your liver doesn’t need time off and you don’t need to binge.”<br />Keri Glassman, a New York-based nutritionist, registered dietitian and founder of the Nutritious Life Studio, also discussed the significance of our everyday customs. “Rituals can be important for consistency and structure within our days, weeks or months. A healthy ritual can be powerful in terms of maintaining long-term healthy behaviors,” Ms. Glassman noted. Dryuary devotees need to assess their goals—and their reasons for giving up alcohol, she said. “If you are doing it because you really overdid it, you’d better figure out why you overdid it,” she advised. “It’s better to alter your behavior long term.”</td>

      <td>In 2020, underwriters were the kings of Wall Street.<br />The biggest investment banks recorded better-than-expected years, even though a global pandemic sent shockwaves through businesses and households. No business grew more than their operations selling stocks.<br />In the spring, clients bracing for economic trouble turned to stock markets to raise cash. In the latter part of 2020, it was the SPACs—special-purpose acquisition vehicles—that raised billions of dollars as a quick and suddenly popular way to get more companies into the public markets’ wide-open arms.<br />The banks’ fourth-quarter results provide fresh evidence of the equity-underwriting hot streak, raising hopes that SPACs may continue to boost the banks’ results even as the overall economy shows signs of slowing down.<br />A SPAC is a public entity with no business that raises investor funds through an initial public offering. That so-called blank-check company seeks a merger, allowing its new partner to go public without the delays and demands of a traditional IPO. They were a quiet corner of Wall Street for years but surged in popularity in 2020. SPACs raised $82 billion in the U.S. last year, greater than all of the money previously raised, according to Dealogic.</td>

      <td>Capital region likely suffered major financial hit from crowd-less inauguration</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON’S INAUGURAL RESOURCES get repurposed for a crowd-free ceremony in a city on lockdown. The Government Printing Office produced thousands of tickets, invitations, programs—even parking passes. And rather than let them go to waste, they plan on distributing them after the fact as mementos. The materials will be doled out to individual congressional offices, like they would be for a typical inaugural.<br />Hotels that would normally have all their rooms booked with fans of the incoming president are instead filled with around 25,000 National Guard troops, with tour bus companies ferrying them back and forth to the Capitol and downtown. Restaurants that normally have their best week in four years instead closed, after a pandemic-related indoor dining ban was extended due to fears of unrest after the Capitol riot. Some chefs used their excess capacity, funded by donations from around the country, to cook for Guard troops. The eateries later tried to expand their efforts to cook for Capitol maintenance staff, though they were told by the Architect of the Capitol that staff there couldn’t accept food or gift cards, only thank-you notes, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The capital region likely suffered a major financial hit from a crowd-less inauguration. According to an estimate by economist Stephen Fuller for the Washington Business Journal in 2016, the combined economic impact of President Donald Trump’s inauguration plus the Women’s March the following day likely resulted in a $1 billion economic impact of direct and indirect spending, on par with President Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration.<br />DEFEATED CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES have mostly struck out in their bids to join the Biden administration, despite prominent speculation that many would be tapped for posts as consolation prizes for losing their races. Former Alabama Sen. Doug Jones was passed over for attorney general in favor of Judge Merrick Garland, former Iowa Rep. Abby Finkenauer failed to get significant consideration for labor secretary, and former Montana governor and losing 2020 Senate candidate Steve Bullock was passed over for interior secretary.<br />Two lower-tier exceptions: Dr. Cameron Webb, who lost a House race in Virginia, will join Biden’s Covid-19 response team and former Rep. Max Rose, who lost his bid for re-election, will become a special assistant to the defense secretary. And Jaime Harrison, the losing South Carolina Senate candidate, can claim the biggest prize of all non-administration posts as the next leader of the Democratic National Committee.</td>

      <td>In the frothy EV sector, companies focused on parcel-delivery vans have a stronger business case than most</td>
      <td>When you think of electric vehicles, you might think first of a Tesla. But a more financially rewarding use of the technology that is upending the automotive industry could be the vans that deliver your online shopping.<br />Until recently, such unassuming vehicles occupied an easily ignored niche within the multitrillion-dollar automotive industry. That is changing fast. This week, privately held Rivian Automotive raised $2.65 billion at a $27.6 billion valuation to fund its rollout of EVs, including a delivery vehicle for e-commerce giant  Amazon.com ,  which holds a stake in the startup. Last week,  General Motors  said it was creating a new company, BrightDrop, to focus on selling EVs to the delivery market. It expects to ship 500 units to its launch partner,  FedEx ,  later this year.<br />Startups are rushing into the space, in some cases armed with cheap capital from an ebullient stock market. California startup  Canoo  went public in December with a plan to focus squarely on so-called last-mile delivery—getting goods to your door. Arrival, a British startup that has received funding and a big order from  United Parcel Service ,  plans to follow suit later this quarter.<br />Electric vans are at the confluence of two big trends. One is the rise of e-commerce at the expense of bricks-and-mortar retail, to which the Covid-19 pandemic has given a boost. E-commerce accounted for 21% of U.S. retail sales last year, a big jump from 15.8% in 2019, according to consulting firm Digital Commerce 360. Vans are shovels in this gold rush.<br />In 2019, U.S. fleet sales of vans rose 19%, their best performance in years, according to research firm J.D. Power. Last year they fell back 21% as florists, pet-grooming businesses and the like delayed purchases during the pandemic. But van sales held up much better than the wider fleet market, thanks to the growth of the delivery business.</td>

      <td>MEXICO CITY—The Mexican government is preparing a banking product to help migrant workers change their dollars as an alternative to a bill in Congress that would put the responsibility for excess foreign cash on the central bank, Mexico’s top finance official said.<br />The bill passed last month by the Senate would require the Bank of Mexico to take dollars and other foreign currency in cash that commercial banks are unable to put into the financial system, but the lower house postponed a vote on the legislation after a flurry of criticism.<br />The central bank said the bill if passed would violate its constitutional autonomy, and international ratings firms said it could undermine Mexico’s financial credibility.<br />Mexico has limits on the amount of foreign currency that individuals and businesses can deposit in cash, as part of measures to combat the laundering of illicit funds. But of the $4.7 billion of foreign currency received in cash in the first nine months of 2020, banks were able to place with clients in Mexico or repatriate through U.S. correspondent banks all but $102 million.<br />Proponents of the bill, lawmakers of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s Morena party, said it seeks to benefit Mexicans who receive remittances or tourist dollars in cash but can’t exchange them for pesos or are forced to exchange them at unfavorable rates.</td>

      <td>The coming IPO of the Tencent-backed company in Hong Kong could be one of the city’s biggest</td>
      <td>TikTok was undoubtedly the most talked about app in 2020, both for its viral popularity and the resulting political troubles. Its largest competitor in China hasn’t received as much scrutiny abroad, but could still make a splash in the market.<br />The coming initial public offering of Tencent-backed Kuaishou—“fast hand” in Chinese—in Hong Kong could be one of the city’s biggest. Founded in 2011 as an app for making GIFs—animated images used in chats—the company is now the second-largest short-video app in China, behind Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, one of the IPO sponsors, value it between $70 billion and $97 billion.<br />Kuaishou has 262 million users spending an average 86 minutes every day on the app. While Douyin was first known for goofy videos with music and dance that drew young people in, Kuaishou began as an app that documented daily lives of ordinary people outside of big cities. These days, more and more users are on both apps, but Kuaishou’s users are still more concentrated in smaller cities.<br />Kuaishou made nearly two-thirds of its revenue from live streaming in the first nine months of 2020: Users buy virtual gifts to give performers as tips. Live streaming was very popular in China a few years ago, but has now been usurped by short videos. Such a shift is prominent in Kuaishou’s financials too: Live streaming accounted for 95% of revenue in 2017.<br />Live streaming’s contribution will likely continue to fall, but what replaces it is more exciting for investors. The company’s advertising revenue, springboarding from the popularity of its short-video app, tripled year-over-year in the first nine months in 2020 and now accounts for around a third of revenue. The ad business also is likely more profitable than live streaming. Kuaishou’s gross profit margin has expanded in the past few years.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden will sign a pair of executive orders Friday to strengthen the federal safety net, boost economic relief and enhance worker protections, as the U.S. continues to recover from the pandemic-induced recession.<br />Mr. Biden will ask agencies across the government to take immediate steps to enhance federal benefits, such as expanding food assistance, improving distribution of stimulus checks and clarifying that workers may refuse jobs with unsafe working conditions and still qualify for unemployment benefits, administration officials said Thursday.<br />He also intends to issue a second order that would restore collective bargaining power for federal workers, revoke an order from former President Donald Trump that exempted some federal positions from competitive hiring procedures and civil-service protections, and direct agencies to start planning for a $15 minimum wage for federal workers and contractors.<br />“These actions are not a substitute for comprehensive legislative relief,” Brian Deese, the director of Mr. Biden’s National Economic Council, said on a call with reporters Thursday. “But they will provide a critical lifeline to millions of American families. And that’s why the president is going to act quickly on these steps.”<br />Mr. Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion economic aid package to help bolster the economic recovery that includes $1,400 stimulus payments, extended jobless benefits, aid for state and local governments and money for a nationwide vaccination program. But his legislative agenda may face early hurdles in a narrowly divided Congress, as Democrats also try to advance Mr. Biden’s nominees and prepare for a second impeachment trial of Mr. Trump.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY—Google threatened to shut down its search engine in Australia if a proposed law requiring tech giants to pay publishers for news isn’t changed.<br />The warning escalates the long-running battle pitting the  Alphabet Inc.  unit and  Facebook Inc.  against the Australian government, whose efforts to compel tech companies to pay publishers is being widely watched globally and could offer a model for other countries. Last year, Facebook said it would restrict Australian users from sharing news articles on its platforms if the proposal became law.<br />The Australian code would require binding arbitration if publishers and the tech companies can’t reach a deal on compensation. Media companies in Australia, including the local subsidiary of  News Corp ,  owner of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co., have supported that provision, arguing that it would prevent the tech giants from walking away from negotiations.<br />Mel Silva, Google Australia’s managing director, told a parliamentary committee Friday that under the so-called news-media bargaining code, Google would have to pay publishers for links to news articles that appear in search results. That would set an untenable precedent, she said, noting that unrestricted linking between websites is fundamental to how its search engine operates.<br />“If this version of the code were to become law it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,” she said. “That would be a bad outcome not just for us, but for the Australian people, media diversity and small businesses who use Google Search.”</td>

But Mr. Kamensky and some others held out for more. Later in bankruptcy court, they argued it was worth more than Neiman’s owners, Ares Management Corp. and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, were letting on.<br />The owners said in court documents they viewed creditors’ estimates of Mytheresa’s worth as ‘astronomically high’, pointing out the unit had been shopped in 2019 and generated offers of no more than $500 million.</td>

      <td>Chip maker hints at more outsourcing, but expects majority of future chips to be made in-house</td>
      <td>Even Pat Gelsinger can only do so much in a week.<br />The former  Intel Corp.  engineer was named chief executive of the chip-making titan last week. Wall Street roundly cheered the move, believing that a leader with strong technical chops was needed to help Intel finally solve its long-running manufacturing problems. But the announcement came just a week before the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report, in which the company had promised to announce whether it would outsource manufacturing of more future chip designs, likely to rival  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing .<br />Mr. Gelsinger won’t officially start until Feb. 15, but he came on Thursday’s conference call with analysts to give a hint of this thinking. He said he was pleased with the progress the company has made on its 7-nanometer manufacturing process under development. He said he was confident that the majority of Intel’s 2023 products would be made internally, though also that it was likely that Intel would expand its use of outside manufacturing “for certain technologies and products.”<br />In other words, no radical changes seem to be in the offing. That is unsurprising, given Intel’s long history in chip making and the significant challenges that would come from trying to pursue a “fabless” business model. But these vague pronouncements will leave investors guessing for a while more. Intel’s share price jumped more than 6% in the final minutes of trading Thursday, as its earnings report slipped out early. But the stock gave up nearly 5% in after-hours trading following the call.<br />The leadership change also prevented Intel from giving a forecast for the new year, which it typically has in its fourth-quarter report. The company’s results from the fourth quarter—and its projection for the first quarter—show the strong benefits of a booming market for PCs, along with continued weakness on the data center side. Intel promised a fuller outlook for the year and more details about its manufacturing strategy once Mr. Gelsinger has had more time on the job. He won’t be able to spend much of it in the break room.</td>

      <td>Well, well. Democrats are finally appreciating Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the unitary executive. We’re referring to Joe Biden’s day one dismissal of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) director Kathy Kraninger and National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) general counsel Peter Robb.<br />A President deserves his own people to lead administrative agencies. But Mr. Biden’s dismissals are a break with long precedent at the NLRB and a 180-degree reversal of Democratic views about the CFPB. The good news is that this could trigger a legal challenge to hoary Supreme Court precedents.<br />In 2010 the Democratic Congress created the CFPB as an independent agency whose director could be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance. While on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, then-Judge Kavanaugh wrote both a decision and a dissent arguing this limitation violated the separation of powers. His logic was adopted by the High Court last summer (Seila Law v. CFPB).<br />Cue the liberal indignation. “The Court’s Republican appointees made clear in Seila their distaste for independent agencies,” roared Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse.<br />For the record, Ms. Kraninger supported the President’s blanket removal authority even though it meant a future President could remove her. So it has happened. Ms. Kraninger received a White House email at 12:21 p.m. Wednesday stating: “If you do not resign as of 2 pm today, President Biden will remove you from that office.”</td>

Left-wing rioters rampaged in the streets of Portland, Ore., and Seattle on Wednesday, no matter Joe Biden’s unity plea.<br />In Portland, rioters smashed the windows of the Democratic Party headquarters and scrawled graffiti on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. Demonstrators carried signs reading “we are ungovernable” and “we don’t want Biden—we want revenge! For police murders, imperialist wars, and fascist massacres.”<br />Portland police say some rioters carried “pepper ball guns, electronic crowd control weapons similar to Tasers, large fireworks, shields and rocks” and that “weapons were seized including Molotov Cocktails, knives, batons, chemical spray and a crowbar.” No doubt mostly peaceful protesters, as CNN likes to describe this sort of thing.<br />In Seattle, protesters burned an American flag outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, and rioters shattered windows at the federal William Kenzo Nakamura courthouse, an AmazonGo store, and the Pike Place  Starbucks .  Some chanted at the police, “We protect people, you protect property,” according to the Seattle Times. Law enforcement arrested three people for property damage, burglary and felony assault.<br />The rioters in both cities identified themselves as anarchists or Antifa members who claimed to be protesting racism, fascism and police brutality. Yet in damaging a federal courthouse and Democratic headquarters, they attacked the judiciary and democratic institutions.</td>

      <td>Democrats are eager to get rolling on their priorities, and the multi-trillion-dollar question is whether they’ll blow up the Senate legislative filibuster to pass a progressive agenda with 51 votes. This procedural radicalism won’t be the political winner the party imagines.<br />Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell have been working on a deal to share power in a Senate split between 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats. (Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties.) During such a divide in 2001, the parties ironed out procedures that, for example, allowed leadership of both parties to move bills deadlocked in committee. This is a good model but it’ll be harder to strike a deal amid current political passions.<br />Mr. McConnell wants Democrats to agree not to end the legislative filibuster as part of the arrangement. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin has said several times he won’t lend the necessary vote to nuke the 60-vote threshold. Mr. McConnell is right to want to address the question before a heated political dispute arises.<br />But Democrats want to keep this hostage so they can threaten to shoot it. The progressive playbook: Wait for an emergency and claim that extraordinary times warrant breaking the filibuster, and hope Mr. Manchin rolls under pressure. Then try to ram through every Democratic priority from a public ObamaCare option to D.C. statehood.<br />The left has recast the filibuster as racist for its 1950s role in delaying progress on civil rights. But a mere four years ago some 61 Senators signed a letter calling to “preserve existing rules, practices, and traditions” in Senate debate, including then Sen. Harris and Democrats Cory Booker (New Jersey); Patrick Leahy (Vermont); Chris Coons (Delaware); Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and many more. The only difference now is that a Democrat is President.</td>

      <td>Alejandro Mayorkas is getting the questions he dodged the last time.</td>
      <td>With the recent attack on the Capitol, Latin American migrants headed to the U.S. border, and other looming threats, the Biden Administration is pushing for quick Senate approval of national-security nominees. On Tuesday Sen. Josh Hawley (R, Mo.) inflicted a small setback by objecting to fast-tracking Mr. Biden’s pick to head the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, to a confirmation vote.<br />The Senator says he has concerns about the Biden Administration’s immigration plans, and that Mr. Mayorkas “declined to say he would enforce the laws Congress has already passed to secure the border wall system.” Mr. Mayorkas is also well known as an architect of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that Barack Obama pushed through by executive fiat after he couldn’t get it through Congress.<br />Those pushing for quick approval argue Mr. Mayorkas has been confirmed by the Senate three times over his political career. But as Ohio Republican Rob Portman noted at Tuesday’s confirmation Senate hearing, Mr. Mayorkas was last confirmed in 2013. That was before the release of a scathing Inspector General report in which individuals “throughout the ranks of USCIS” complained that, as director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Mr. Mayorkas had intervened to benefit wealthy and politically connected foreign investors seeking EB-5 visas.<br />These investors were connected to people such as former Clinton associate and future Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, and Tony Rodham, Hillary Clinton’s brother. The report further quotes one “high-ranking USCIS official” saying that employees with different views were afraid to speak up in meetings because Mr. Mayorkas would “cut them up, take them apart or put them in their place.”<br />The IG found nothing criminal, and Mr. Mayorkas insists he intervened only to ensure cases were decided correctly. But the report details Mr. Mayorkas’s troubling habit of communicating with applicants and stakeholders outside the normal process—and the “appearance of favoritism and special access” he created. The IG report adds that in each of the three instances investigated, “but for Mr. Mayorkas’ intervention, the matter would have been decided differently.” The IG at the time, Obama appointee John Roth, stands by his findings today.</td>

      <td>After an exhausting four years, a relatively normal inauguration offers hope that better days are ahead.</td>
      <td>So it ended, so it begins. We ought to give ourselves a moment this weekend to take pleasure in the end of a strange, grinding era and rejoice in the continuance of something we had blithely taken for granted: the peaceful transfer of presidential power. That jewel in our crown had been there a long time; we’d neglected the binding wire and setting and it came loose. The aim of the inauguration was to show it is back in place, immovably, as are our institutions, and our 200-year-old way of moving forward in the world.<br />It was all very handsome and well done, a real achievement considering the circumstances: a pandemic, an insurrection in the Capitol two weeks earlier, and what amounted to a military occupation of the streets. The swearings-in took place in what amounted to a militarized ghost town. There is a grim defensiveness in a guarded, boarded-up, fenced-off Capitol Hill and White House. Their relative undefendedness in the past was an assertion: We have nothing to fear from each other. You lose a lot when you lose that.<br />There was no way the planners could produce a happy, moving inauguration with that degree of difficulty. Yet they did. It was a day worthy of a great people.<br />I did not, unlike everyone I know and almost every conservative, find tears in my eyes. I just felt gratitude and relief.<br />What a hunger there is for “normal,” for stately, serene and dignified. For seeing forms maintained.</td>

      <td>Cybercriminals recruit unwitting accomplices to launder cash via electronic transfer.</td>
      <td>Ads that offered the opportunity to “Make $$$ working from home” once were stapled to telephone poles. Today, they’re posted in internet chats, online job boards and social media. They promise big payouts from a few hours of work. The payouts are real, but the work isn’t. The ads seek money launderers, known in the world of cybercrime as “money mules.” The era of the amateur criminal has begun.<br />Big theft is no longer the sole territory of art forgers, safecrackers or even seasoned hackers. In the 2018 film “Ocean’s 8,” a crew of sophisticated criminals plan an elaborate scheme to steal a $150 million diamond necklace from a fundraising gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In real life, last July the U.S. charged Ramon Abbas, a Nigerian Instagrammer known as “Hushpuppi,” with participating in a plot to steal $124 million.<br />Mr. Abbas didn’t have an obvious background in computer technology. He’s not alleged to have hacked computers or stolen data or money. He had none of the “skills” we typically associate with criminal masterminds like those in “Ocean’s 8.” His alleged contribution to the criminal team was to serve as the “cash out” leader. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, he recruited and maintained a global network of people with bank accounts to launder money at his direction. He is currently awaiting trial in federal court in California.<br />With rising unemployment during the pandemic, criminal gangs are recruiting vulnerable and desperate workers to open bank accounts, or use their pre-existing accounts, and move cash via electronic transfer. The number of digital money mules is increasing; in early December, Europol and authorities from 26 countries identified more than 4,000 money mules working around the world.<br />Some participate in these schemes knowingly, but many are unwitting—making it hard to distinguish between victim and criminal. Acting as a money mule is illegal, and perpetrators can be prosecuted even if they aren’t aware they are committing a crime, although typically the FBI only issues warnings to those it concludes are unwitting conspirators.</td>

      <td>If reasonable Republicans want to hold off the far left, they will have to stop the rise of the far right.</td>
      <td>We have a new year and a new administration, but America’s crisis hasn’t yet passed. The dangerous forces unleashed over the past five years are still dominant in one major party and are increasingly potent in the other. Reining these dark elements in will take courage and honesty, two characteristics that have been in short supply in Washington. If we fail, the radicals will succeed in using fear and violence to empower each other, crushing the moderates between them.<br />Americans have always been good at pushing ahead without dwelling on the past. This has advantages, such as the risk-taking and tradition-breaking that made the last 100 years the American century. Sometimes, however, unpleasant facts must be confronted.<br />If a reckoning is postponed, American conservatism will continue to regress. To many, the total disintegration of the Republican Party may sound like good news, but they’re wrong. A bloody victory is unlikely to help. If the left refuses to work with moderate conservatives, those remaining moderates will soon be replaced by radicals with whom there can be no compromise.<br />Another renowned American quality, blunt honesty, has been replaced by brash dishonesty. The consensus that most Americans ultimately want the same things—prosperity, freedom, justice—has been broken. The opposition is now routinely treated not as a political rival, but as an enemy of the state. Social media is pushing aside traditional media. The threat of political violence may become normal. The barbarians have overrun both the gatekeepers and the gates.<br />These trends have been personified by Donald Trump. This is the first hard truth conservatives must accept if they wish to come in from the cold and again shape the future of the U.S. and the world. The right must disavow its extremists or be destroyed by them. Republicans—or preferably, in my view, members of a new and truly conservative party—must tame their violent, conspiracy-loving fringe. They can start by proving that it’s the fringe and not the whole carpet.</td>

      <td>Three weeks ago my wife and I were toasting the New Year and giving blessings for the last. It was a year in which we welcomed our first grandchild, reason enough to be thankful. It was also a year during which we maintained our health, despite living, shopping, working and commuting in the heart of the city with the world’s worst Covid-19 death record. It appeared we were going to skate through the pandemic into the post-pandemic era without getting sick.<br />Then the coughing began.<br />After a long day at work, I went to bed early and kept waking up with a hacking cough. I rose the next morning feeling dizzy and achy with a cold sweat. I called my doctor, who got right to the point: “You probably have Covid; that’s the only thing getting through masks these days.”<br />Since I had a fever, I went directly to NYU Hospital’s emergency Covid ward. Although it was overcrowded, an unexpected calm prevailed. Several of the nurses and aides told me they’d already had Covid. Others had been vaccinated. More important, they said, they now have powerful weapons to use against the virus.<br />The weapon that interested me most was the antibody cocktail by Regeneron that has emerged from this crisis as a giant-killer. Once my test came back positive, I asked the nurses whether I could get the casirivimab and imdevimab drugs that night. They said it’s only given the day after you’re diagnosed. I also learned that despite Operation Warp Speed’s remarkable achievements in bringing drugs like this to the market quickly, there were still regulatory barriers to its distribution that seemed needlessly bureaucratic.</td>

      <td>The firing of Peter Robb belies all the happy talk about unifying the country.</td>
      <td>The “unity” lasted all of a couple of minutes. Then, hours after President Biden pledged in his inaugural address to show “tolerance and humility,” the brass knuckles came out.<br />One duster was aimed at Peter Robb, general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. Within minutes of Mr. Biden’s swearing-in, and as the new president told the nation it needed to “be better,” the new White House delivered Mr. Robb an ultimatum: resign by 5 p.m., or be fired.<br />The general-counsel position is a Senate-confirmed four-year appointment at an independent agency; Mr. Robb had 10 months left in his term. No NLRB general counsel had ever been fired, and the Biden White House provided no cause for the action. Mr. Robb pointed all this out in a return letter and respectfully declined to step down. So Mr. Biden (“we must end this uncivil war”) canned him.<br />For four years, the media and Democrats cast every action of the Trump administration as something law-breaking or verging on a constitutional crisis. This week’s headlines, by contrast, were a mass media celebration of the return to “normalcy.” Mr. Biden ran on, and won on, a promise to restore norms to Washington.<br />The Robb firing illustrates the falsehood of both those narratives. For all Mr. Trump’s bad manners, his administration’s actions were largely by the book. Mr. Trump never fired Richard Griffin, Barack Obama’s NLRB general counsel, who served nine months to the end of his term in 2017. For all the talk of Mr. Biden as the embodiment of gentlemanly politics, Democrats have no intention of playing by the rules. They intend to impose an agenda and won’t let a little thing like a 70-year-old precedent, or embarrassment over double standards, get in their way.</td>

Mr. Austin retired from the Army in 2016.<br />The House approved the waiver on a 326 to 78 vote. The Senate waiver vote was 69 to 27.<br />Retired Marine Corps Gen.

The union, which enlisted area workers at the delivery company last year, made the letter available online.<br />On Tuesday, Instacart said in a blog post it would be winding down in-store operations at some retailers over the coming months as several customers moved to use their own employees but Instacart technology to fulfill orders. The company didn’t say in the post how many workers would lose positions.<br />Instacart is also planning on cutting the positions as it focuses on having workers both fulfill and deliver orders, the letter says. That approach streamlines “the selection and delivery process so that one…contractor simultaneously selects and delivers an order to a customer,” according to the letter.<br />The company now has about 500,000 people who work using that approach, the letter says. Starting in 2018, it began reducing the number of people handling in-store shopping only in several markets around the U.S. and now has fewer than 10,000 in that role, according to the letter. The company’s workforce is largely made up of so-called gig workers.</td>

Advising presidents, he said, “takes different forms depending on what the circumstances at hand are.”<br />Dr. Fauci, whose once-frequent appearances at White House briefings last year tailed off in the final months of the Trump administration, was back in the spotlight Thursday to brief reporters on the new administration’s Covid-19 strategy.<br />In response to a reporter’s question, Dr. Fauci said it was a “liberating feeling” to be working for the new administration, acknowledging that appearing at press briefings with former President Donald Trump was often uncomfortable as Mr. Trump embraced remedies such as use of hydroxychloroquine on limited evidence.</td>

But there’s still a very long way to go before stage actors and other freelance artists, jazz and pop musicians in particular—not to mention those in associated professions like set design, lighting technology and sound mixing—can start to earn a living again.

He proposed to limit power plants’ emissions in the short term and set the industry on the path to becoming carbon free by 2035. On his first day, he took steps to limit the oil-and-gas industry’s methane emissions and he has vowed to boost electric-vehicle adoption by adding 500,000 new charging outlets by 2030.<br />Those actions could face judicial challenges and pushback from industry groups that represent certain fossil-fuel interests. Pursuing his agenda also will require Mr. Biden to obtain, in some cases, congressional approval or changes to tax law. His infrastructure package also could help re-establish the U.S. as a leader on climate initiatives, but enacting this ambitious legislation could be difficult after asking Congress to approve considerable expenditures to fight Covid-19.<br />China and other nations have recently increased their pledges to do more to tackle climate change, and corporations are heavily investing in the technology needed to run the global economy with fewer greenhouse-gas emissions.<br />But global emissions continue to rise, and groups tracking progress question whether many of the countries that have signed the Paris agreement are currently on track to hit the targets they set to reduce their share.</td>

      <td>Democrats in politics and the press agree to pretend the economy is a disaster.</td>
      <td>If readers think this week’s adoring press coverage of President Joe Biden is excessive, they should just wait until next year. Media folk are so eager to prepare for a “Biden recovery” narrative in the future that they are making outlandish claims about the present.<br />This column has previously noted the legion of gloom the president is leading alongside former rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (Socialist, Vt.) to attempt to justify massive federal interventions. Mr. Sanders enjoys making ridiculous comparisons between today’s economy and the Great Depression.<br />Reporters are also eligible to enlist in the legion. “Biden inherits the worst job market of any modern president,” says a Washington Post headline. Postie Eli Rosenberg writes:<br />Sounds like a dire situation indeed, but perhaps less so when one realizes that the unemployment rate was higher during most of the Obama-Biden administration. Around the end of the fifth long year of Mr. Biden’s tenure as vice president, which included his leading role in implementing White House economic “stimulus” programs, the unemployment rate finally fell to that magic number of 6.7%. Unfortunately, during the two Obama-Biden terms the unemployment rate never got close to the Trump-era low of 3.5%, which American workers were enjoying in the pre-Covid days of February 2020.<br />It should also be noted that while misguided virus responses from state and local governments have indeed resulted in 10 million fewer people with jobs than in early 2020, the shutdowns actually killed more than 22 million jobs at their nadir. Since then the rapid recovery of most of the jobs killed by the lockdown is strong evidence that the economy is ready to roar if Mr. Biden’s Democratic colleagues in state government will allow it.</td>

      <td>Online luxury-fashion retailer Mytheresa, which used to be owned by struggling department store Neiman Marcus, has fetched a high price at its market debut. Although the business seems to tick all the right boxes for investors, not all trends are in its favor.<br />This week, around one-fifth of Mytheresa’s parent company,  MYT Netherlands ,  was sold to investors at a $2.2 billion valuation. Appetite for fashion e-commerce businesses is strong among investors. One week after its initial public offering, Poshmark’s shares are trading about 66% above where they initially priced.<br />Mytheresa shares started trading Thursday at $35.85, and ended their first day at $31, up 19% from the offering price on the New York Stock Exchange.<br />It is a great result for Mytheresa’s owners, private-equity firm Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, after a messy legal spat and Neiman Marcus’s bankruptcy. The department store’s bondholders sued the duo for changing Mytheresa’s place in the failing retailer’s corporate structure in a way that put it out of reach of creditors.<br />Proceeds from the sale will ultimately be used to settle debt the parent company owes as part of the bankruptcy settlement. Although the loans don’t mature until 2025, they carry an expensive 7.5% coupon so it makes sense to retire them early.</td>

      <td>Social-media giant says decision from independent panel would be binding, can’t be overruled by CEO Mark Zuckerberg</td>
      <td>Facebook Inc.  has referred its decision to indefinitely suspend the accounts of former President Donald Trump to its outside oversight board, as the company grapples with how to treat one of its highest-profile users after his exit from public office.<br />Earlier this month the social-media giant moved to disable Mr. Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts for at least two weeks, after he encouraged protests of the election results and his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a Jan. 6 attack that left five dead. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that the risks of Mr. Trump’s use of the platforms through Inauguration Day were too great.<br />“We believe our decision was necessary and right,” said Nick Clegg, Facebook’s communications and policy chief, in a blog post Thursday, one day after the swearing-in of President Joe Biden. “Given its significance, we think it is important for the board to review it and reach an independent judgment on whether it should be upheld.”<br />Mr. Trump has condemned the violence but defended his conduct ahead of the riot, which followed a monthslong effort to advance baseless claims of a rigged election. He faces a second impeachment trial in the Senate on a charge of inciting insurrection. Bipartisan political leaders including Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) have said publicly that Mr. Trump provoked the riot through his online and offline rhetoric.<br />Facebook said the former president’s accounts would remain suspended while five members of the 20-person oversight board determine whether certain posts he made before the riot had violated the company’s community standards and values.</td>

      <td>A devastating illness and an unconventional living arrangement push the bounds of friendship in this drama starring Dakota Johnson, Casey Affleck and Jason Segel.</td>
      <td>‘Our Friend” really does celebrate friendship. If that falls short of a bombshell, some explanation is in order. Gabriela Cowperthwaite’s beautiful and affecting drama is also about mortal illness, a terrible cancer that strikes a wife and mother in her prime, and devastates her husband and two young daughters as well. But artistry involves choices, and the abiding emphasis here is as unfashionable and open-hearted as the film’s title. It’s less on the ravages of the disease than on the changes that ensue when the couple’s best friend shows up to help out for two weeks, then stays to become part of the family. (Ticket and streaming info at ourfriendmovie.com.)<br />The stars are Dakota Johnson, Casey Affleck and Jason Segel; all three give flawless performances. Ms. Johnson is Nicole Teague, a buoyant woman who may not have lived up to the ardent prophecy of her boyfriend and, later, husband—“They’re going to say ‘There she is, the greatest living musical theater actress of all time!’” All the same, she enjoyed a modest career in regional theater until motherhood came along. Mr. Affleck is Nicole’s husband, Matt Teague, a journalist who, in real life, was the author of the 2015 Esquire Magazine article that the film was based on. The longtime friend is Dane Faucheux, who, in the adaptation by Brad Ingelsby and in Mr. Segel’s exquisite quicksilver portrayal, turns out to be not only indispensable but a pure soul, a lost soul, an unlikely soulmate of Mary Poppins and one of the most endearing characters to have graced the screen in recent memory.<br />Most of the action is set in and around Fairhope, Ala., a small town that’s home for Nicole, Matt and their kids, Molly (Isabella Kai) and Evie (Violet McGraw). But the narrative hops back and forth between present and past, always displaying time stamps that note how many years it is before or since Nicole’s diagnosis in 2012. The film is too long and its structure can be distracting, but it dramatizes the transformative nature of the event, and, in flashbacks to a happier time, the loving ties that bind Nicole and Matt to the man she’s known since college, and who subsequently became his best friend. (The cinematography, clear-eyed yet calmly lyrical, was done by Joe Anderson.)<br />Dane lives in New Orleans and works as a manager at a small sporting goods store. Wonderfully funny and poignantly charming, yet faintly haunted, he sustains his love life at a simmer and struggles with some sort of existential fear that isn’t specified and doesn’t need to be. We understand, just as Nicole and Matt do, that lack of ambition isn’t Dane’s problem; what he lacks is the belief that he can forge a good life for himself. Until, that is, he intervenes at a moment when his friends’ distress is spiraling out of control, and possibly saves himself in the process. (Mr. Segel is so touching, and Ms. Cowperthwaite’s direction so assured, that I happily embraced the movie’s most contrived sequence, one in which Dane goes on a solitary hike in a borderline-allegorical desert wilderness.)<br />The intimacy of Ms. Johnson’s performance is extraordinary. She is the least assertive of movie stars, yet the courage, despair and fury she finds in Nicole will lift you up and spin you around. Mr. Affleck’s dry precision, his gift for emitting while withholding like some master of Tibetan throat singing, confers a distinctive quality on Matt—a passionate remove that reveals his inability, at least at first, to confront his beloved’s decline. And the elegance of the film’s craftsmanship is all the more remarkable given that the director, Ms. Cowperthwaite, is best known for her 2013 “Blackfish,” a shocking and controversial documentary about captive killer whales at the SeaWorld chain of theme parks.</td>

      <td>A filmmaker directs a difficult subject—her husband; a small army of relatives reunite on a tropical island.</td>
      <td>‘Losing Alice” (Begins Friday, AppleTV), a gripping tale of ambition, struggles for success and numerous other kinds of psychological hunger, begins like many another dark tale—with a fateful meeting between strangers on a train. Hitchcock will come to mind. That he does is a testament to the strong whiff of menace that can arise in this eight-episode Israeli series —even from a fresh-faced young woman’s clear delight at recognizing her longtime idol, movie director Alice Ginor.<br />She’s played by a steadfastly enthralling Ayelet Zurer: The show is all hers. The young woman, who introduces herself as Sophie Marciano (Lihi Kornowski), elaborates on all that Alice’s films have meant to her. All of which Alice is pleased enough to hear, though she also looks quite recognizably like someone who would be happy to end the conversation and return to reading her cellphone. The authenticity of this opening scene holds a bright promise. Gradually, Sophie, still nattering on about her devotion, becomes a touch less endearing. “I wondered where you disappeared to,” she tells Alice, who requires no reminders that her film directing efforts are now sparse. She teaches, edits scripts and commercials, Alice explains, and she has a family.<br />And she is now about to become busy, she learns, dealing with Sophie, who has just dropped the news that she herself has written a film script and would love nothing more than for Alice’s husband, David (Gal Toren), a prominent actor, to star in it. Alice learns this on the train while holding an unlockable bathroom door closed for Sophie, who has dragooned her idol into the performance of this duty without hesitation—a reminder of her youth: She’s 24 years old. It’s the end of any suspicion this relationship might echo the one in “All About Eve.” Though this is just the beginning of Sophie’s entry into Alice’s life and career.<br />There is good reason, as the story unfolds, for an inclination to find the familiar, some pattern to relate to. For as it turns out, there is, in “Losing Alice”—which bills itself as a psychological thriller—a steady infusion of illusory events and other elements intended to deepen the mystery of this tale, many of which instead simply flatten the story into little points of confusion as flashy ventures of this kind tend to do.<br />Between those little points, fortunately, a rich drama emerges of ambition and the passion for achievement, not only in Alice but the world of filmmakers in which she travels. (The series is the creation of Sigal Avin.) The tone is undergirded by humor at its best, and not surprisingly, in the most erotic scenes. The ones that require Alice—who has been made director of Sophie’s film—to direct her husband making intimate love to a beautiful young woman. One of these leads to a moment of undeniable revelation when Alice, a cool, sophisticated professional, snaps out “Cut!” Why cut, her ever patient and honest husband wants to know—what’s wrong with the scene? Do it over, he’s told. The actors embrace again and again, the director snaps “Cut!” By this time David is livid, and shouting; the director can’t tell him what’s wrong with the take. Everyone else will have guessed—it’s unbearable to her.</td>

The line, which is now partially built but not operating, was eventually expected to transport 830,000 barrels of oil 1,210 miles from the Canadian oil sands to Steele City, Neb., where it would link to existing pipelines heading to Gulf Coast refineries.<br />Soon after TC proposed the pipeline, it ran into opposition from environmental groups. They cited the threat of spills, and they wanted to reduce the amount of oil extracted from Canada’s oil sands, widely seen as among the most greenhouse-gas intensive energy in the world.</td>

      <td>Dror Moreh’s documentary gives a behind-the-scenes look at 30 years of Israel-Palestine peace talks from the perspective of the American negotiators.</td>
      <td>After seeing “The Human Factor” at the Telluride Film Festival 18 months ago, I used the word “astonishing” to describe Dror Moreh’s account of America’s failed efforts to forge peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The film is no less so today as it goes into select theaters in New York and Los Angeles. It’s surely the most spellbinding documentary ever made about the mediation process. The events it depicts, beginning in 1991, have been colored ever more darkly by the passage of time. The idea of pursuing noble goals through persistent diplomatic give and take now seems like a vestige of a vanished era. Yet Mr. Moreh’s intimate history is more than a chronicle of failure. It’s a study of diplomacy as high and instructive drama, one in which a shifting cast of characters struggles to understand one another’s unstated motives and covert goals.<br />The story is told from the point of view of the American negotiators, a team led by the Middle East envoy Dennis Ross. In the first of many fascinating discussions, Mr. Ross explicates the notion that provides the film’s title. “You can’t ignore the human factor. Someone who has the human touch treats someone else with respect. Someone who has the human touch doesn’t think they’re going to outsmart anybody.” Like his on-camera narrator, though, Mr. Moreh, an Israeli filmmaker whose previous documentary feature was the 2012 Oscar-nominated “The Gatekeepers,” has a rich appreciation of contradiction. His title also reflects the all-too-human failing of seeing the world as one would like it to be, rather than as it is.<br />That’s not the case with American Secretary of State James Baker, who comes off here as a masterful negotiator with a gift for using great power to good ends. Nor does it describe Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, so determined to end hostilities with the Palestinians that he was secretly willing to risk civil war in his own divided country if that’s what it took to push a treaty through. As he and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat meet at the White House and sign a 1993 peace agreement—Oslo I, a set of intentionally ambiguous principles contained in the so-called Oslo Accords—“The Human Factor” is caught up in a crescendo of hope. Then the drama turns to high tragedy when, in 1995, Rabin is cut down by a lone gunman opposed to the Oslo Accords and the prospects of epochal peace die with him. (Mr. Ross tries to discuss the impact of Rabin’s death, but, more than two decades later, he still can’t get the words out of his mouth.)<br />The former Israeli foreign minister Abba Eban famously quipped that the Palestinians “never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.” The film suggests that Arafat was ready to seize the opportunity presented by Rabin. After the assassination, however, the quip might have described not only Arafat but others seated at a succession of negotiating tables. Following a resurgence of violence in Jerusalem that threatened to end any hope of peace, President Bill Clinton brought all parties together at a White House summit. There, during a lunch, Mr. Ross tells us, King Hussein of Jordan turned to Israel’s new hardline prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and said “You don’t have the maturity to be a leader. You’re not like Rabin. You have to grow up and become a leader, and you’re not one today.” We’re also told that Ehud Barak, who succeeded Mr. Netanyahu in 1999—a decade before Mr. Netanyahu became prime minister once again—fancied himself another Churchill; he was mistaken.<br />The great distinction of “The Human Factor” is its intimacy. Mr. Moreh achieves it by combining on-camera interviews—with Mr. Ross and other mediators on his team—with a wealth of still photos shot inside the negotiating chambers; he interweaves them so skillfully that we seem to be witnessing fateful discussions in real time. Thirty years after the U.S.-sponsored Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative began, there is no peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and no roadmap pointing toward it. Yet the film provides a basic map for keeping the peace in whatever sphere—political, commercial or personal. The principles it expounds begin and end with empathy, an abstract quality that Mr. Ross brings down to ground level with a familiar formulation. “The essence of empathy,” he says, “is the capacity to put yourself in someone else’s shoes.”</td>

      <td>Ukraine’s dystopic Oscar entry takes place in a polluted landscape strewn with abandoned machinery and frozen corpses.</td>
      <td>Taking the waters takes on new meaning in “Atlantis,” a fearfully powerful feature by Valentyn Vasyanovych and Ukraine’s Oscar entry for international features. In 2025, just one dystopian year after the supposed end of the Russo-Ukraine war, an army vet, Sergiy (Andriy Rymaruk), ekes out a living trucking water to polluted areas of his native Eastern Ukraine. When he decides to take a long-needed bath, he pumps some of the precious stuff from his truck into the amputated bucket of a vanished excavator, lights a wood fire under the huge clawed thing and absorbs the all-too-fleeting warmth.<br />Warmth is hard to come by in Sergiy’s life. He spends long minutes ironing a pair of frozen pants that he’s retrieved from a clothesline outside his scruffy apartment. Long, slow rituals are the hallmark of this film, none of them longer, slower, more meticulous or riveting, in their grisly way, than the work of a volunteer team that recovers and autopsies corpses strewn all across the ravaged land. Most of the bodies are partially mummified, a fit condition for a partially mummified country (and, as befits its title, a sunken land).<br />By now I may have convinced you to put “Atlantis” at the top of your don’t-watch list. If that’s the case, please reconsider. (The film is currently streaming on metrograph.com/live-screenings/atlantis/, and will expand to virtual cinemas next week.) Mr. Vasyanovych’s approach is literally and figuratively visionary. One aspect of the vision is its treatment of machinery. Not since Jennifer Baichwal’s seminal 2006 documentary “Manufactured Landscapes” has there been a motion picture in which enormous encrusted things—trucks, freight trains, a steel factory in terminal fever—possess more vitality than some of the tired souls who run them.<br />That has the indirect effect of expressing the devastation of the Russo-Ukraine war. But another part of the vision is the spectacle of hope rising, uncertainly but persistently, from the vast ashes. World-weary though he may be, Sergiy is attracted to one of the members of the recovery team, Katya (Liudmyla Bileka), an archaeologist before the war. He’s candid with her about his attachment to this shattered place. He can no longer live among normal people, he tells her. But she understands. Normal isn’t the issue. Living is.<br />Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com</td>

      <td>In Hungary’s Oscar entry, a neurosurgeon worries she’s losing her mind after a man with whom she is smitten claims that he does not know her.</td>
      <td>The title of Hungary’s Oscar entry is pleasingly, quirkily long—“Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time”—and the premise is irresistible. Márta (Natasa Stork), a superstar Hungarian brain surgeon living in New Jersey, meets a fellow neurosurgeon at a scientific conference. Before discovering that he’s Hungarian too—his name is Janós and he’s played by Viktor Bodó—she decides he’s the man for her, not merely Mr. Right but Dr. Perfect. They talk. She’s captivated. But he’s returning to Hungary after the conference, so they agree to meet at a given time on a given day on the Pest side of Budapest’s Liberty Bridge. Then, throwing caution and very possibly part of her career to the wind, she flies back to the country of her birth, only to discover that he’s a no-show. When she tracks him down near the hospital where he works, he looks at her blankly, insisting they’ve never met.<br />Hello Alfred Hitchcock! Hey there, Krzysztof Kieslowski, and Franz Kafka too! This tale of obsession by Lili Horvát is so sensuous and richly detailed that you can hardly wait for the mystery to be explained. And once it is? Well, there’s no way to say it but to say it—enthrallment gives way to disappointment, because the reveal isn’t equal to the buildup. Yet you’ve still had the experience of being taken in—much more in a good way than a bad one—by a gifted filmmaker wielding cinema’s seductive power.<br />It’s a paradox. What I recall most vividly isn’t the letdown but a host of hypnotic moments leading up to it, and the intensity of Ms. Stork’s performance. (Róbert Maly did the sharp-focus cinematography.) Whether or not he remembers her, Márta and Janós join forces as surgeons. She operates, with him in admiring attendance, on a man who’s lost the ability to recall certain words. Exploring her patient’s brain, Márta takes exquisite pains to avoid injuring its precious speech center. But Janós’s continued emotional distance leads her to believe, in the privacy of her thoughts in her rented room, that she may be losing her mind. Movies are seldom flawless and don’t have to be. This one speaks more eloquently to how a spell can be woven rather than broken.<br />Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden will keep Christopher Wray in place as FBI director, the White House confirmed Thursday, providing stability atop the nation’s premier law-enforcement agency as the new administration confronts the rising threat of domestic extremism after the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol.<br />The decision comes as the Federal Bureau of Investigation continues its probe of hundreds of members of the pro-Trump mob that stormed the halls of Congress on Jan. 6—one of the most substantial investigations undertaken in U.S. history. Agency watchdogs are scrutinizing the government’s inability to prevent the deadly attack.<br />The acting U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., Michael Sherwin, who has been running the investigation into the riot, briefed the new Justice Department leadership on Wednesday about the sprawling inquiry that has already led to the arrest of more than 100 alleged rioters on federal charges, with hundreds more under investigation, an agency spokesman confirmed.<br />Investigators are moving swiftly to probe the activities of alleged right-wing militia members who may have planned the attack and some of the more violent incidents, including assaults on police officers, as many of the charged defendants have begun cooperating, law-enforcement officials said. Prosecutors are also expected to charge in the coming days people who allegedly attacked members of the media during the riot, officials said.<br />Biden administration officials have told U.S. attorneys around the country, many of whom were appointed by former President Donald Trump, to stay in their roles for now. It plans to replace them individually in the coming months rather than ask them to leave all at once, Justice Department officials said.</td>

      <td>Kimberley Strassel’s “Big Business’s Sharp Left Turn” (Potomac Watch, Jan. 15) reminds me of my youth in Maryland where the local lunch counters had signs saying: “We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.” In the time of Jim Crow laws, everyone knew what that meant: unless you were white, you would not receive service at the lunch counter. The argument was that “this is a private business, so we can set our own rules.” The courts finally said something to the effect of, yes, it is a private business, but the doors are open to the general public, therefore you cannot refuse service to any customer because of race. As a result, the lunch counters and other public businesses were integrated.<br />Sadly, those signs have returned, although not targeting nonwhites at lunch counters, but instead targeting conservatives on social-media platforms, etc. Apparently, conservatives are now being considered an undesirable class of citizens.<br />As the courts threw out double standards of service for whites versus nonwhites by public, but privately owned, businesses, perhaps there is a legal remedy for the double standard against conservative speech.<br />Michael R.

      <td>Regarding your editorial “Biden’s First Fracking Test” (Jan. 11): The proposed New Jersey liquefied natural gas (LNG) port should be an easy call, but not for the reasons you suggest.<br />This massive facility would be the first LNG project in the majestic Delaware River Basin—which provides drinking water for more than 15 million people. Make no mistake, every aspect of this project poses significant risks to our environment and our communities.<br />For starters, LNG is especially harmful to the climate. In every step of its life cycle, LNG emits methane—a powerful greenhouse gas that is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide. LNG is also potentially explosive. Even the tiniest leak can ignite fires and explosions. The project would move LNG over hundreds of miles through heavily populated areas in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, ripping through black, brown and low-income communities and putting thousands at risk of deadly accidents.<br />The Gibbstown site also appears to violate rules governing toxic PCB water pollution. PCBs, one of only a handful of chemicals ever banned in the U.S., are especially dangerous to pregnant women and unborn children. Pollution from PCBs has turned the nearby Hudson River into one the largest Superfund sites in the nation and decimated the Hudson’s once-thriving commercial fishery.<br />Astonishingly, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has failed to even conduct a full study of the project’s environmental impacts, as required by bedrock federal environmental law.</td>

The firm called for Corteva to replace its chief executive, Jim Collins, potentially with an unnamed CEO candidate Starboard has in mind. The Wall Street Journal reported Starboard’s push late Wednesday.<br />Starboard and its CEO, Jeff Smith, said Corteva has been slow to improve its profitability, missed opportunities to improve its operations and hasn’t held Mr. Collins accountable. “Corteva and its shareholders deserve better,” Mr. Smith wrote Thursday in a letter to Corteva’s board.<br />Greg Page, Corteva’s chairman, said Thursday that the company’s board unanimously supported Mr. Collins. Corteva’s directors and executives have met several times with Starboard and agreed on some of the firm’s points, Mr. Page said, but so far Starboard hadn’t made specific recommendations to improve the company’s operations.</td>

The extension is likely to be agreed upon quickly despite friction between Washington and Moscow, current and former officials said.<br />A five-year extension would provide a measure of predictability to the U.S. and Russian military competition and has been urged by pro-arms control groups. In addition to limiting long-range nuclear arms, the accord provides for weapons inspections and monitoring.<br />With the demise of the U.S.-Russian treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear forces, New START is the last major building block in the legal regime that regulates the nuclear competition between the U.S. and Russia.</td>

The jump has come amid enthusiasm over GM’s electric-vehicle plans and  Microsoft Corp.’s  investment this week in Cruise, GM’s majority-owned autonomous-car division.<br />Investors have come to expect double-digit stock moves from  Tesla Inc.  and a bevy of electric-vehicle startups that have gone public over the last year.

      <td>The humble fisherman’s knit is a cozy, versatile staple—and a better outfit enhancer than your tired hoodie. Here, expert tips on how to wear it as smartly as Sally Albright does.</td>
      <td>AT THE OUTSET of 2021, after flinging open a trunk where I store overflow clothing, I fished out a treasure: a wool fisherman’s sweater from A.P.C that I bought on sale a decade ago and have sporadically worn since. The color of oatmeal, it is slightly scratchy and unyielding, weighing my shoulders and billowing into a Winnie the Pooh-ish belly no matter my posture. That said, like any fisherman’s sweater, it’s hyper-functional, super-duper warm, low-key and unflappably resistant to the ebbs and flows of fashion.<br />As such, this classic knit is my ideal non-athleisure garment for this moment. While relatively comfortable, it still lends my looks an air of put-togetherness. Edith Young, 27, a New York writer and artist agrees: “It reads as more intentional than a fleece, which I associate with walking to the gym pre-pandemic.”<br />The fisherman’s sweater has popped up in pop culture in films like “Love Story” and “The Thomas Crown Affair,” but the most indelible iteration is the flame-red version that Meg Ryan’s Sally Albright wears again and again throughout the 1989 romantic comedy “When Harry Met Sally.” It’s what Sally has layered beneath a corduroy jacket when she and her old acquaintance Harry (Billy Crystal) run into each other at a bookstore, and on it stays throughout their multi-scene catch-up in the park and out to lunch. Later, when the still-platonic pair set up Harry’s bachelor pad and compare dating woes, our heroine is back in her cozy rosy pullover, now tucked into a black skirt.<br />Also known as Aran sweaters, named for the islands off the coast of Galway where they originated, these garments were traditionally handmade by fishermen’s wives and bear intricate patterns said to be imbued with meaning. The cable stitch, for instance, is believed to have been inspired by Irish fishermen’s ropes and to confer good luck at sea. The zigzag, some contend, represents the ups and downs of marriage.<br />“I consider my fisherman sweater to be an old friend,” said Portland, Maine-based Owen Kelly, who’s in his 40s. Mr. Kelly is the V.P. of product creation at L.L. Bean, which has sold versions of the classic since 1981, when they were cornerstones of the then-pivotal preppy uniform. The brand’s cotton fisherman was its Men’s Signature line’s bestselling sweater in 2020.</td>

      <td>New research shows that people across the political spectrum have similar views about when and how wealth should be redistributed.</td>
      <td>Psychologist Alison Gopnik explores new discoveries in the science of human nature. Read previous columns here.<br />What do the haves owe to the have-nots? Should a society redistribute resources from some people to others? These questions are central to the economic policy differences between left and right. The opposing views might seem completely irreconcilable. But a new paper in the journal Cognition suggests that people of all political stripes have surprisingly similar views about redistribution, at least in the abstract.<br />Daniel Nettle at Newcastle University and Rebecca Saxe at MIT presented 2,400 people in the U.K. with stories about how an imaginary village could divvy up the food people grew in their gardens. A simple graphic allowed the participants to say how much food they thought should go from villagers who had more to those who had less.<br />The scenario allowed the researchers to systematically vary aspects of the problem. They looked at four factors. How much did the garden yields depend on luck? In some versions of the scenario, the weather had a big influence on how much food each villager produced; in others, luck was less important. How homogenous was the village? In some versions the villagers had very similar “beliefs, customs and appearance,” in others they were “rather different.” Were the villagers at peace with other villages or under attack? And was food abundant or scarce in general?<br />The participants also reported how far to the right or left their politics were, and across the spectrum the results were very consistent. Everybody thought there should be some redistribution of food—there weren’t any real Scrooges. People of all political persuasions thought there should be more redistribution when luck played a larger role, when the village was more homogenous, when the village was under attack and when resources were abundant. Political views did play a small role in people’s judgments: Those on the right were slightly less likely to redistribute than those on the left. But politics was much less important than the particular story of that village.</td>

Some of the business’s partners and clients said they would cut ties to Mr. Trump after his supporters stormed the Capitol in an effort to overturn President Biden’s election win.<br />Eric Trump, who has been running the Trump Organization since his father took the White House, said in an interview Thursday that the family business was in strong financial shape.<br />“I have 75 million people who would follow my father to the ends of the Earth,” he said. “He’s got probably the most famous brand in the world.

The U.S. had helped shape the accord under President Barack Obama but seven months after the pact took effect in late 2016, President Donald Trump withdrew the country.<br />The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international accord—though it is not a treaty—that was adopted at a United Nations climate conference in Paris in December 2015. It entered into force on Nov. 4, 2016, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified it.<br />The accord sets out a global framework to prevent dangerous climate change. It seeks to limit the rise in overall global temperature to less than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, with a target of no more than 1.5 degrees. Alongside this it aims to help countries financially in their efforts to tackle climate change and its impact.<br />Former President Donald Trump believed the accord put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage because of regulatory and financial burdens it would put on American companies. On announcing the U.S. departure in June 2017, he called the move a “reassertion of our sovereignty.”<br />Mr. Trump framed his decision mostly in economic and political terms, pointing to the agreement’s lesser requirements for the world’s other leading carbon emitters, China and India. He voiced concern for protecting the environment but he said his decision was rooted in protecting the country’s interests.</td>

Mr. Liuzzo’s son Lamberto Liuzzo, 55, was sentenced to five years and two months in prison for his part in the scheme.

An attorney for Mr. Caloia, Domenico Pulitanò, said he would appeal. Lawyers for Gabriele and Lamberto Liuzzo didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.<br />At their indictment in 2018, Vatican prosecutors accused Mr. Caloia and his lawyer of causing losses of more than €50 million for the bank, officially known as the Institute for the Works of Religion. The men were accused of embezzling money from the sale of 29 of the bank’s properties, most of them in or near Rome.

Liz Cheney broke with most of her party to vote to impeach then-President Donald Trump.<br />Now the top-ranking House Republican is contending with the consequences, both in Washington and at home in Wyoming.<br />Mr. Trump’s allies in the House GOP are circulating a petition aimed at setting up a vote calling on Ms. Cheney to resign her leadership position as GOP conference chairwoman. Meanwhile in Wyoming—where Mr. Trump had his biggest victories of any state both in 2016 and 2020—Ms. Cheney drew her first primary opponent on Wednesday, when state Sen. Anthony Bouchard said he would challenge her.<br />As the Republican Party grapples with its future after Mr. Trump’s departure Wednesday, Ms. Cheney’s fate will be an early indicator of which direction GOP lawmakers plan to go.

      <td>President directs Occupational Safety and Health Administration to quickly require employers to adopt protocols for protecting workers from virus</td>
      <td>President Biden directed a federal workplace-safety regulator to require employers to develop coronavirus protocols and enforce compliance.<br />Mr. Biden asked the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in a planned executive action Thursday to pursue an emergency temporary standard that would set Covid-19 workplace-safety requirements, as part of a series of executive orders this week.<br />“It is critical that the federal government protect the health and safety of America’s workers and take swift action to prevent workers from contracting COVID-19 in the workplace,” the Biden administration said a pandemic strategy document.<br />Labor and business groups expect OSHA to implement a rule quickly. The process for issuing an emergency standard isn’t as involved as the traditional federal rule-making process, in part because it lets government skip the usual public-comment period.<br />Many Democrats and worker advocates support developing a federal rule. Republicans and businesses worry that could become a burden for employers to implement.</td>

      <td>President Biden’s overt religiosity is a relatively modern trend in U.S. history.</td>
      <td>Presidential inaugural addresses are unpredictable, but it’s a good bet that they will refer to the Bible. President Biden did, quoting Psalm 30:5: “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.” This is part of a welcome, long-running trend toward more religious language in public life.<br />Mr. Biden has cited Psalm 30 in speeches before, and it seems particularly apt in these dark times. Mr. Biden also encouraged his fellow Americans to “open our souls instead of hardening our hearts,” an allusion to God hardening Pharaoh’s heart, beginning with Exodus 7:13.<br />With these references, 27 out of 45 presidents have cited the Bible in their inaugural addresses, making a total of 64 biblical references. Forty-four came from the Hebrew Bible and 20 from the New Testament. John F. Kennedy, the only Catholic president before Mr. Biden, made the most allusions in one speech, with five. He referenced the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, including Isaiah 58:6’s call to “undo the heavy burdens . . . and to let the oppressed go free” and Romans 12:12’s “rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation.”<br />The tradition of biblical allusions in inaugural addresses dates back to the beginning of the Republic, when George Washington made an argument for them. In his first inaugural, Washington referred to Psalm 82. “It would be peculiarly improper,” he said, “to omit in this official act my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of the nations.”<br />Somewhat more surprising is the biblical reference from Thomas Jefferson, a deist who famously excised from a Bible any references to Jesus’ divinity. Jefferson spoke hopefully of a chosen country with “room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth generation,” an allusion to Exodus 20:6.</td>

      <td>Millennials are using prenups to address new economic and social issues—including rising student debt, social-media use and embryo ownership</td>
      <td>Millennials are often known to buck convention. That seems to be true even when it comes to prenuptial agreements.<br />In the past, prenups were most common among young adults from wealthy families or couples entering second or third marriages. Today, younger adults of all income levels are drafting them, not only to protect assets accumulated before and during marriage but to address societal realities that weren’t necessarily present or common years ago, such as a desire to keep finances separate, student debt, social-media use, embryo ownership and even pet care.<br />Experts point to the fact that many millennials are children of divorced parents and have had an intimate look at what can happen financially when a marriage dissolves. At the same time, the stigma or taboo that used to be associated with discussing money before marriage is slowly disappearing.<br />“You’re effectively negotiating your divorce agreement in advance in a way that’s more egalitarian than before,” says Jacqueline Harounian, a partner with the law firm Wisselman, Harounian & Associates in Great Neck, N.Y.<br />Some millennial couples who want to maintain a clear separation of their finances during marriage are using prenups as a workaround for state laws that would otherwise treat certain assets as marital property.</td>

      <td>U.S. carriers are hoping that pent-up demand for leisure travel could be unleashed as soon as this summer</td>
      <td>Airline stocks are a bet on a summer travel boom. One is certainly possible after a year or more of people being mostly stuck at home, but so far investors have little to go on but hope.<br />Shares of  United Airlines  fell around 6% Thursday morning, dragging down peers. The Chicago-based airline on Wednesday reported a $1.9 billion net loss for the fourth quarter and estimated that its first-quarter revenue will be 65% to 70% lower than in the same period of 2019.<br />Terrible numbers are unsurprising. Even in normal times, airlines struggle to make a profit during the winter months. And after a brief winter-holiday bump, traffic remains depressed amid the continuing Covid-19 pandemic. Corporate travel is expected to take years to recover, which is of particular concern to United’s business-focused network.<br />Airline stocks have given up the sizable gains made in recent days after United’s competitor  Delta Air Lines suggested last week that there could be a boom in leisure travel as soon as this summer. “Visits across Delta’s digital channels are significantly outpacing the passenger volumes we’re carrying,” said Chief Executive Ed Bastian, adding that holders of Delta’s co-branded  American Express  card were keeping their points in anticipation of redeeming them for air travel in 2021.<br />A poll by brokerage Jefferies published Wednesday showed that 80% of Americans who flew in 2019 plan to do so again this year, most of them in the summer.</td>

      <td>10 months on, a small cohort of tailoring traditionalists still refuses to trade ties for T-shirts</td>
      <td>LAST YEAR was all about shlumpy sweatpants, plush house slippers and mundane Zoom shirts. As many Americans shifted to working from home—and later trickled back into offices—our wardrobes took a hard left turn into the world of casual wear. But even as elastic waists and jersey became de rigueur for a chunk of the corporate class, a smaller portion of WFH men—let’s call them tailoring holdouts—continue to cling to their blazers, suits and neckties like life rafts in a tumultuous year. These men found comfort in their sartorial formality, even if they never want to be labeled “the tie guy” on Zoom calls ever again.<br />What’s behind this tailoring commitment? For starters, many of these suit stalwarts are nagged by a feeling that they must maintain some level of decorum even from home. Last summer, months after the pandemic’s onset, Shawn Sukumar, 37, a trial lawyer in Washington, D.C., had his court hearings moved to video call. Though none of his superiors or others on-high specified a dress code, he felt it best to toe the line and wear his suit and tie on the calls. He believes you should look polished when speaking before a court—even digitally. And if you’re wondering: No, he never wore anything but full trousers with his sport coat even though he was only shown from the waist up. No shorts. Certainly no boxers. “I don’t trust the video on that. I wear pants every time.”<br />Mr. Sukumar’s legal colleagues tend to stick to suits during hearings, too, but formal fusspots who work in other fields look conspicuously odd on Zoom in their blazered looks. When his dining room became his office, Graham Pickering, 31, an engineer for an energy company outside New Orleans, continued to button up his dress shirts and blazers each day. “I just wanted to put my best foot forward because we’re a traditional conservative company in a conservative industry. I didn’t want to appear to be taking advantage of [working from home],” he said. Yet, he admits that many of his co-workers didn’t maintain such fastidious standards—and that even his boss “would probably laugh” at his sartorial rigidity.<br />Others feel formality encourages an industrious mind-set. Fraser Martens, 33, an economic analyst in Moscow, Idaho, has been working from home since early last year. Without his commute, or office interactions, he craves “structure” during workdays. He finds it in his chambray dress shirts and Brooks Brothers ties, which communicate to himself, “OK, it’s time for work. You’re going to be sitting in your bedroom, but you are wearing your work clothes.”<br />But on some level, the truth is tailoring traditionalists just like dressing up. Brandon Mitchell, 38, a Bronx-based marketing director for a nonprofit, has a closet brimming with vintage tweed jackets and flannel trousers. To him clothes are a hobby he’s compelled to indulge. As his work shifted to video calls, colleagues ribbed him that he’d be swapping his coats and ties for T-shirts in no time. Mr. Mitchell took that as a challenge and beginning in March, he started cataloging his raffish outfits on Instagram. A peak-lapel sport coat with a yellow tie one day, a glen-check blazer with brown trousers the next, a Gregory Peck-esque flannel suit the following week. His outfits were a lighthearted way to mark time during lockdown.</td>

      <td>The big vacation rental sites can easily overwhelm prospective renters. These five smaller alternatives are regionally focused, easily managed—and seriously picky.</td>
      <td>THE LANDSCAPE of vacation rentals is vast and uncharted. It’s easy to get lost in a search for a perfect beach house or mountain cabin and—between extraordinary demand and an unbelievable clutter of duds—it's not so easy to find one. To relieve the stress, niche vacation rental companies are curating collections, helping claustrophobia-plagued city-dwellers to winnow possibilities down to that one dreamy escape. As travel anxieties continue to simmer, regionally specific sites offer good drive-to options. “And people don’t just rent on weekends anymore,” said Jennifer Grimes, founder of Red Cottage Inc. in upstate New York. “Last March, it was like a switch was flipped, from short breaks to [long-term] escape properties. Renters are not necessarily burning vacation days. When all this ends, people are going to go on vacation for six months.” Hear hear! To help find a place to hang your hat, here are five specialists:<br />Founded in 2007, long before the hickster renaissance of the Catskills, Red Cottage Inc. seeks out houses with exceptional interiors. The collection of 52 properties—expected to grow by 40% this year, according to the founder—ranges from rustic cabins to country estates, almost all of which are exclusively listed. Many feature nature-gazing conveniences: for example, a hot tub, fire pit, or outdoor pavilion and integrated kitchen. The houses tend to be remote so they’re equipped with amenities like Wi-Fi switches for the front light, so city slickers don’t get freaked out by the pitch black.<br />A-list Example: The three-bedroom Basecamp, like a modern Swedish summer house plopped down on 19 private acres in Saugerties, N.Y., from $500 a night, redcottageinc.com<br />Holly Williams is a musician (she’s Hank’s granddaughter) and entrepreneur (her shop, White’s Mercantile, originated in Nashville and is now a mini empire in the south). And she has a thing for houses. She finds historic relics to renovate—or “redeem,” as she says—with a modern-meets-Southern design aesthetic. At the three rental properties that make up her White’s Room and Board portfolio, you’ll find a mix of her grandmother’s oil paintings with her husband Chris Coleman’s striking black-and-white works on paper, as well as leather club chairs, floral wallpaper, things found in French flea markets, claw-foot tubs and sisal rugs.<br />A-list Example: Sweeney Cottage, an 1892 dollhouse in Leiper’s Fork, with a chic little kitchen with a mint green Smeg refrigerator, a Bertazzoni stove and a doormat that says “Howdy,” from $250 a night, whitesroomandboard.com</td>

      <td>FRANKFURT—The European Central Bank kept its large monetary stimulus unchanged on Thursday, pledging to continue backstopping the region’s governments via large-scale debt purchases as a stubborn wave of Covid-19 infections darkened the economic outlook.<br />In a statement, the ECB said it would continue to buy up to 1.85 trillion euros, equivalent to $2.24 trillion, of eurozone bonds through March 2022, as planned, meaning that it will continue to absorb the bulk of the debt issued by eurozone countries this year.<br />The ECB’s bond purchases support the region’s governments as they spend freely on job-furlough and other programs aimed at keeping businesses and jobs alive. The ECB left its key interest rate unchanged at minus 0.5%.<br />Europe’s economic outlook has darkened since the ECB’s last policy meeting in December, when President Christine Lagarde unveiled a large new stimulus package. With infection rates still high across the region, governments in Germany and other countries have signaled in recent days that they will tighten or extend social restrictions. Meanwhile, the rollout of vaccinations has been sluggish.<br />Analysts worry that the region’s $13 trillion economy will slide back into recession in the first three months of 2021, as businesses and households remain cautious. Eurozone inflation has been below zero for the past five months, through December, far from the ECB’s target of just below 2%. The euro has also staged a rally against the dollar in recent months, hurting the competitiveness of Europe’s large exporters in crucial overseas markets such as the U.S.</td>

Mr. Adamczyk is part of the North Carolina trio, along with Atrium CEO Eugene Woods and Tepper President Tom Glick. “We dramatically need to pick up the pace.”<br />The North Carolina executives aren’t the only business leaders stepping in to offer private-sector expertise to help more Americans get Covid-19 shots.<br />Washington state this week said that private companies will lend expertise to accelerate its vaccine rollout, among them  Starbucks Corp. , which will provide help with vaccine-administration facility layout and has started working on ways to reduce patient wait times.</td>

But analysts surveyed by FactSet foresee lower sales this year, in part reflecting a pair of divestitures and growing competitive pressure. And while Intel has benefited from a boom in demand for PCs in the work-from-home economy, much of the added buying has focused on lower-cost laptops that aren’t as profitable. Net income for 2020 is expected to fall to $19.3 billion, from $21.1 billion the year prior.<br />Intel’s longer-term strategy around the outsourcing of chip production is also in flux ahead of the arrival of Pat Gelsinger as CEO. Bob Swan, the company’s departing chief executive, said last year that a decision was forthcoming by early this year on whether to have the company’s advanced chips made by a third party after Intel fell behind Asian rivals in the development of the next generation of superfast semiconductors.<br />The company is considering outsourcing production of some of its most prized chips to those Asian rivals, and particularly to  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , the largest and most advanced contract chip maker in the world, according to people familiar with the matter.</td>

      <td>Drugmaker plans to ask U.S. health regulators to expand bamlanivimab’s use to protect nursing-home residents and staff from Covid-19</td>
      <td>Eli Lilly  & Co. said its antibody-based drug prevented Covid-19 among many residents and staff of nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, results that point to the drug complementing vaccines while inoculations increase.<br />The drug, called bamlanivimab, reduced the risk of both staff and residents getting sick with Covid-19 by about 57% compared with a placebo, Lilly said Thursday. The effect was more pronounced among residents, the company said, an 80% reduction in risk of Covid-19.<br />The findings signal the potential for a new preventive weapon that could augment the fledgling Covid-19 vaccination effort to stem the pandemic.<br />Lilly said it would ask U.S. health regulators to widen the drug’s authorized use to include protecting people in long-term-care facilities where someone has recently been diagnosed with Covid-19.<br />The partial results were from a last-stage, or Phase 3, study conducted in partnership with the National Institutes of Health. Lilly disclosed the data in a news release and said it plans to publish full results in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</td>

      <td>The U.S. stock market’s most popular financial services exchange-traded fund is hovering near an all-time high for the first time since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, propelled by a handful of big stocks.<br />The  which has roughly $30 billion in assets and tracks the S&P 500’s financial sector, reached $31.46 a share last week, eclipsing its February 2020 high. Shares traded just below $31 on Wednesday.<br />ETFs tracking the S&P 500’s technology, communication, consumer-discretionary and health-care sectors surpassed their pre-Covid-19 highs last year. But many cyclical groups, including financials, had lagged behind the broader stock market’s recovery as investors favored buying shares of fast-growing companies. Since the November elections, though, the investment tides have shifted toward economically sensitive companies amid expectations of heavy spending by Democrats, which investors expect will help boost growth.<br />Investors have sought to increase their exposure to bank stocks by putting money into the Financial Select Sector ETF for 11 straight weeks. Flows so far in January have reached $3.6 billion, already exceeding every full-month total since November 2016, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper.<br />But some investors might not realize that the ETF is essentially a wager on the success of a few of the biggest financial stocks in the S&P 500.  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. and  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  account for about a quarter of the fund, while the addition of  Bank of America Corp.  increases the collective weighting of the three stocks to roughly 33%. It is no surprise then that the ETF’s return to record levels coincided with a rally in those stocks.</td>

      <td>Mask-wearing and higher vaccination rates have contributed to historically low levels of seasonal influenza</td>
      <td>Influenza, usually raging throughout the Northern Hemisphere this time of year, has become virtually invisible.<br />It is a small bright spot amid Covid-19, although the number of people saved from a flu death pales next to the number dying from the new pandemic. It also presents questions that doctors around the globe will likely be wrestling with for years: If flu can be nearly wiped out this season, why not every season? Which steps help the most to stop the flu from spreading?<br />“This is an extremely puzzling phenomenon. We’re in a historic, unbelievable situation,” said Norio Sugaya, a pediatrician who serves on a World Health Organization influenza committee.<br />The WHO says the measures people and governments are taking to prevent the spread of Covid-19, such as wearing masks and limiting public gatherings, have probably helped keep the flu in check. Increased flu vaccination rates may also be contributing, it says.<br />Another hypothesis holds that the broad spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, in countries like the U.S. may play a role in blocking the flu by lifting people’s immunity against other viruses. One study in the spring of 2020 in New York City found that people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were far less likely to be carrying other common viruses such as influenza viruses. Still, research into that hypothesis is just beginning.</td>

      <td>BAGHDAD—Twin suicide bombings ripped through a crowded marketplace in Baghdad on Thursday, killing at least 32 people and wounding at least 75 others in the first such attack in Iraq’s capital in more than two years.<br />The explosions shattered a period of relative calm after Islamic State lost the territory it controlled in Iraq and Syria in 2019. The blasts highlight the security challenges facing Iraq after the U.S. withdrew much of its military presence from the country in the last days of the Trump administration.<br />No group claimed responsibility for the bombing. But it bore the hallmarks of Islamic State, which in the past has carried out lethal bombings targeting civilians throughout Iraq and the wider Middle East.<br />Iraqi President Barham Salih condemned the attack, saying in a tweet, “The two terrorist explosions targeting innocent people in Baghdad and at this specific time confirms the attempt by the groups of darkness to target all national entitlements and our people’s aspirations for a safe future.”<br />Yehia Rasool, a military spokesman for Iraq’s prime minister, said Iraqi security forces had received information about the two bombers before the attack and were pursuing them when they blew themselves up. An official statement from Mr. Rasool didn’t include further details about the pursuit of the attackers.</td>

      <td>TAIPEI—Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the U.S. overcame four decades of precedent when she accepted a formal invitation to attend President Joe Biden’s inauguration, calming fears on the self-ruled island that U.S. support would erode in the post-Trump era.<br />Bi-khim Hsiao, Taipei’s top representative in the U.S., tweeted a video of herself standing in front of the U.S. Capitol building ahead of Mr. Biden’s inauguration on Tuesday, saying she was honored to attend the ceremony.<br />“Democracy is our common language and freedom is our common objective,” she said.<br />Ms. Hsiao’s attendance at the behest of the Biden administration marked the first time Taiwan was officially represented at a presidential swearing in since Washington transferred diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, according to Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry. In a tweet, the departing chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Idaho Republican Jim Risch, applauded the incoming White House for the invitation.<br />Beijing sees Taiwan as part of Chinese territory and regards U.S. interactions with the democratic, self-ruled island as one of the most sensitive issues in bilateral relations with Washington. Chinese leaders were taken aback four years ago when then U.S. president-elect Donald Trump accepted a congratulatory phone call from Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen.</td>

According to FactSet, analysts were expecting $7.3 billion. While net written premiums for business insurance slipped slightly, they rose for bond and specialty insurance and personal insurance.<br />Total revenue at Travelers climbed more than 4% to $8.4 billion.<br />The company reported pretax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, of $29 million. A year earlier, those losses were $85 million. Net investment income was $677 million, up almost 10% from a year before.<br />Profit at Travelers for the quarter was $1.31 billion, or $5.10 a share.

      <td>Exit of the Trump administration, seen as best hope for mortgage-finance giants’ privatization, delivers blow</td>
      <td>The end of the Trump administration is the end of the best hope for hedge-fund investors in a long and painful trade: Betting that  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  would one day be returned to private hands.<br />A long list of investors has bet that policy makers would eventually privatize the companies, and that once that path became clear, the value of the shares in these companies would increase dramatically. Most hedge funds hold preferred shares that carry a dividend. These shares are junior to the government’s stake and thus don’t get paid dividends until after the government is paid. So their value is greatly diminished by the large stake the government retains.<br />In one scenario where hedge funds would profit, Fannie and Freddie would raise fresh capital, junior preferred shares would be converted to common stock, and the government would write down or eliminate its senior preferred shares.<br />Investors including John Paulson, Anchorage Capital Group, Discovery Capital Management LLC, Blackstone Credit, Perry Capital, Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management LP and PointState Capital LP have been involved in the trade. Many funds are now expected to have lost money on the investment, though some early buyers and active traders profited.<br />It was a risky bet. But other complex, long-shot trades, including the subprime bet that the housing market would collapse, resulted in big paydays for some funds.</td>
