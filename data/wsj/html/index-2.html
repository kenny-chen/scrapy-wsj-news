      <td>People of all political stripes can’t help but project every problem onto evil politicians.</td>
      <td>Here’s my prediction: On Jan. 20, the No. 1 video on YouTube will be “Ding Dong the Witch Is Dead” from “The Wizard of Oz.” Go ahead, play the song in your head. I’ll wait.<br />This hope for mass emotional relief was best summed up by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who, according to Politico, told her leadership team, “I’m counting down the hours ’til he’s gone. . . . I plan to pull him out of there by his hair, his little hands and his feet.” I guess tearing up the State of the Union speech wasn’t therapeutic enough. Nor is there any peace for the mouth breathers who stormed the Capitol and sat feet-up on her desk. Or the quixotic and psychotic contesting and protesting of the 2020 election—or 2016, or 2000 for that matter.<br />What a mentally unnerving four years. We’ve all heard, “I cried with my daughter that morning.” Some folks actually sent me books on Hitler so I could brush up on what they were convinced would come—but never did. Universities offered therapy dogs and breathing spaces—some with coloring books. “Resist” jewelry jumped off shelves. NBC’s “Today” show seemed to open every day, as did many casual conversations, with “Did you see that tweet?” And we added to the vernacular “Orange Man bad,” “El Cheeto” and the Bidenism “C’mon man!”<br />So many seemingly functioning adults needed someone to blame. A literary agent told the  New York Times : “Trump doesn’t want to let go of his job, and a shockingly high number of us don’t want to let go of him.” Author Douglas Coupland smartly noted that “blame is just a lazy person’s way of making sense of chaos.”<br />Years ago, I believe the comedian Dennis Miller nailed it by saying—and I’ll clean it up—that blaming cigarette companies for getting cancer is like blaming your Members Only jacket for not getting dates in the ’80s. Blame yourself! Mr. Trump or Mrs. Pelosi may not be to your liking, but they weren’t the cause of all your problems. Everyone ought to stop projecting and look inward. Especially the dude in the horns and animal skins.</td>

      <td>Imagine this, football fans: Undefeated Ohio State battles its way to the biggest postseason game of the year. But before the revved-up athletes can go to the airport the university decides: You know, all things considered, we think it would be better if we just didn’t play.<br />It once happened. And as this year’s Buckeyes prepare to play Alabama for the national championship Monday night, what transpired at the end of the 1961 season remains one of the most bizarre episodes in college football history.<br />Ohio State, after tying its opener against Texas Christian, had run the table to finish 8-0-1. In the final game of the regular season, it trounced rival Michigan, 50-20. This was before the playoff system was instituted, so the traditional bowl games were how teams made their case to be voted national champions. Ohio State was invited to play in the most prestigious of those games: the Rose Bowl.<br />As the team prepared for the trip to Pasadena, Calif., to face UCLA, Ohio State’s Faculty Council met to take the required formal vote to accept the Rose Bowl invitation.<br />The faculty voted no.</td>

      <td>Was the car crash that killed Albert Camus and his publisher in 1960 an accident or an assassination engineered by the KGB?</td>
      <td>On Jan. 4, 1960, the world lost one of the most profound voices of the 20th century. Albert Camus, the 46-year-old author of “The Stranger” and “The Plague” and a recent winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, was riding in the passenger seat of a Facel Vega en route to Paris when the car swerved off the road and crashed into a tree. Camus died instantly, while the driver—Camus’s publisher, Michel Gallimard—would die from his injuries a few days later. The man who taught us how to face an absurd world had died an absurd death.<br />The Italian writer Giovanni Catelli contends that this was no accident. In his book “The Death of Camus,” first published in 2013 and translated into English by Andrew Tanzi, Mr. Catelli lays out the theory that Camus’s car crash was a political killing engineered by the KGB. Camus, Mr. Catelli notes, had issued various broadsides against the Soviet Union in the wake of its 1956 invasion of Hungary. Greatly charismatic and internationally revered, Camus posed a serious challenge to Moscow. He was, the author writes, “a free, indomitable and dangerous man.”<br />In short, staccato chapters, Mr. Catelli recounts his investigation into the circumstances surrounding Camus’s car crash. He also revisits the Soviet invasion of Hungary and Camus’s connection to a pair of literary figures: the Czech writer Jan Zábrana and the Russian writer Boris Pasternak. Mr. Catelli’s case is compelling but far from ironclad, and some readers will be more convinced than others. But his book provides a clear and useful window into the currents that political writers were forced to navigate during the Cold War.<br />Zábrana (1931-1984) is central to Mr. Catelli’s narrative. A poet and translator whose parents were persecuted by Czechoslovakia’s communist regime, he rendered Pasternak’s “Doctor Zhivago” into Czech. Mr. Catelli chances one day upon Zábrana’s posthumously published diaries in a Prague bookshop and alights on a passage from 1980, which reads: “I heard something very strange from a knowledgeable and well-connected man. He says the car crash that cost Camus his life in 1960 was set up by Soviet intelligence. They rigged the tyre with a tool that eventually pierced it when the car was travelling at high speed.”<br />Zábrana’s man (who wouldn’t reveal his source) told him that the order was issued by Soviet minister Dmitri Shepilov, in response to an article Camus wrote in March 1957 that attacked Shepilov over the events in Hungary. Mr. Catelli writes that Camus “let loose with all the indignation of a libertarian who refused to bow to tyranny.” He first attacked Shepilov in a speech delivered on Oct. 30, 1956, during a meeting of the exiled Spanish Republican government. He continued to denounce Moscow over the next few years; in 1958, he wrote the preface to “The Truth About the Nagy Affair,” a book published by the anticommunist Congress for Cultural Freedom refuting the charges brought against Imre Nagy, Hungary’s revolutionary prime minister, whom the Soviets executed for treason.</td>

      <td>Investments in acoustic and jamming technology would help cops deal with mobs without shooting.</td>
      <td>Jan. 6 in Washington was a major fiasco for the Capitol Police, and to a lesser extent for the District of Columbia National Guard. Intelligence and planning were poor. It shouldn’t have been hard to anticipate that a mass convergence of many thousands of angry people could pose dangers at the site where all current members of Congress, as well as the incumbent and incoming vice presidents, were present. A mass casualty event could have occurred. Five people lost their lives; several more appropriately lost their jobs in the aftermath.<br />But even if police had been better prepared, preserving order would have been a challenge. Officers on the ground were quickly outnumbered by protesters, and they didn’t want to shoot fellow Americans on the grounds of Congress. As a former Hill staffer, I have long admired the Capitol Police, who preserve public access to the “people’s branch” of government even as they protect those of us, most of all the nation’s elected lawmakers, who work there. Beijing and Moscow may be mocking us, but I would far prefer the reactions, and relative restraint, of those Capitol Hill officers to the kinds of bloodbaths that would surely have occurred under similar circumstances in Russia, China or many other places.<br />There may well be similar failures of intelligence and planning at mass gatherings in the United States in the future. Sometimes it will be understandable, given information available to authorities at the time; sometimes, less so. Now that it has happened, people or groups with truly violent objectives, including mass murder, may see an opportunity to infiltrate themselves within large groups that aren’t necessarily otherwise violent, as jihadists from Syria joined in refugee flows into Europe after Islamic State seized chunks of the Levant. In such situations, police may not be deployed in adequate numbers, establish proper barricades, or be able to call on rapid backup. They need better tools than the police had last week—especially nonlethal weapons to disperse and control unruly crowds or mobs.<br />Today’s nonlethal weapons fall loosely into two categories. One is the group of arms that must be individually targeted—rubber bullets, tasers, beanbag projectiles and the like. These work reasonably well when police aren’t dramatically outnumbered and when particularly dangerous individuals can be identified in a crowd.<br />A second category includes pepper spray, tear gas, wash from low-flying helicopters, water cannons, and other area-effect technologies. These can help in some situations, but they can also cause injury. That is why a Washington Post article June 5, written after the killing of George Floyd, described most nonlethal weapons as “less lethal weapons” in explaining why many cities around the country were reluctant to employ such capabilities during the summer’s protests and riots.</td>

      <td>New variants of the virus will call for adaptations of treatments, which shouldn’t need full studies.</td>
      <td>New variants of the Covid virus appear more infectious, and it’s urgent to get as much protective immunity into the population before these strains can take root. These new variants are evolving in ways that may allow them to slip past diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines. The effort will require a new scientific and regulatory framework that allow countermeasures to be adapted and updated quickly as the threat evolves.<br />The recent variants don’t seem to make Covid infections more severe, but they do make the virus easier to transmit. Some have mutated part of the coronavirus spike protein called the receptor binding domain, which is a target of drugs and vaccines. This genetic evolution was inevitable. The virus has been racing around the world for a year. Countermeasures curtail its spread, but they also enrich the survival prospects of some mutant strains.<br />Two steps would help us stay ahead of these developments. First, engage in real-time monitoring and research. A Covid genomic surveillance system could sample and sequence the virus at a large scale, to identify variants when and where they emerge. There’s a similar system for flu, but not Covid. New investments in experimental science would make possible more insight into how the genetic features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus correlate with its clinical behavior. That can answer the question of whether these evolutionary changes raise new public-health concerns. Next-generation sequencing is widely available in the U.S., but is not being used systematically for public-health surveillance. Most of it is done as part of academic studies that won’t detect strains as they appear.<br />Second, when a new genetic variant is identified and is judged to be a threat, it will be important to have a system for efficiently updating drugs and vaccines.<br />Take the man-made antibody drugs, which latch on to a specific region of the virus and neutralize it, potentially preventing complications if given early in the course of infection. Some of these antibodies target spike proteins that are likely to change. To help prevent threatening variants from emerging, such drugs should be targeted to regions of the virus that don’t change much. When worrisome variants emerge, the antibody drugs can be adapted to go after preserved regions on the new strains. But to keep up with the virus, we will need to evaluate these modified antibodies on their safety and their ability to reduce Covid viral loads, without requiring full outcome studies.</td>

Prices fell in November, due to a pullback in pork prices amid increased supply. China’s producer-price index likely fell 0.8% on year, compared with a 1.5% drop in November, as the price of thermal coal picked up.<br />U.S. consumer prices are expected to increase only moderately in December. Inflation has been mild during much of the pandemic, reflecting weak demand for an array of services and some goods, though some economists expect it to pick up along with faster economic growth later this year.<br />China’s exports are forecast to increase 12.9% from a year earlier in December, a slowdown from November’s 21.1% surge, as another surge of coronavirus cases in Europe and the U.S. puts pressure on external demand for Chinese goods. Meanwhile, December import growth likely accelerated, leading to a largely stable trade surplus of $72 billion.<br />Germany will become the first large economy to release an official estimate of its gross domestic product in 2020, almost certainly recording the first contraction since 2009. The contraction is expected to be of roughly the same magnitude as in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, when GDP fell 5%.</td>

      <td>Approximately one-third of practicing physicians are over the age of 60 and, increasing, more likely to retire.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “Congress’s Doctor Shortage” (Jan. 5): The government’s micromanagement of health care has had many unintended consequences. Spending $900 million to add 1,000 post-graduate medical-education slots seems excessive. That is $900,000 per slot or over three times the four-year tuition costs of medical school. Graduate medical education (GME) has mostly been hospital based while medical care is increasingly provided outside the hospital setting. Restructuring graduate medical education by increasing the focus on community-based care and ambulatory-based surgery to supplement hospital-based care would result in a more cost-effective method for achieving this goal.<br />The second problem of health-care consolidation has been a result of obsolete antitrust laws that encourage health-care consolidation resulting in less competition. As far back as 2010 a report by the attorney general of Massachusetts found up to a 300% difference in costs based on bargaining power and not quality. Consolidation raises prices. We need greater flexibility in our antitrust laws to foster and preserve competition.<br />Physician substitutes including physicians assistants and nurse practitioners can often provide adequate but not equivalent care to board-certified physicians. If these substitutes were in fact equivalent, we should stop spending time and money educating physicians.<br />Approximately one-third of practicing physicians are over the age of 60 and more likely to retire. Covid has accelerated retirements for two reasons: Many older physicians who are at higher risk of dying from Covid have reduced or stopped seeing patients. As physicians age, many continue to enjoy practicing but at a reduced practice load. The further reduction in practice volume, elective procedures and elective surgery since Covid is making these smaller practices unprofitable. Earlier retirement by older physicians will lead to physician shortages sooner than has been previously estimated.<br />Michael T. Goldstein, M.D., J.D.</td>

Sometimes forgotten is that, like major-league players, Negro League all-star teams also toured internationally.

But alas, they decided to truncate the statistics at 1948, when presumably Major League Baseball was picking off the best players from the Negro Leagues and thus making the league no longer on par with the majors.</td>

      <td>Why ‘participatory democracy’ seems always to degenerate into mob violence.</td>
      <td>On Wednesday afternoon I checked in with a Latin American friend to get his thoughts about the chaos on Capitol Hill. “It looks like home,” he quipped.<br />It was not a unique reflection. By evening a popular observation making the rounds was that the invasion of Congress was the stuff of banana republics. The bedlam also evoked memories of what happened in many U.S. cities over the summer when the Black Lives Matter marches turned violent.<br />There was a big difference between Wednesday and the American summer of terror. During the latter it was merely a presidential candidate (Joe Biden) who refused to condemn the BLM violence—until he realized it was hurting his polls numbers. Last week it was a sitting U.S. president who stirred up the passions of his followers and continued to justify their anger even after it was clear they were breaking the law, endangering lives, damaging property, and attempting to disrupt an independent branch of government. President Trump may have set a new modern-day low.<br />Yet the main worry is that political violence in the U.S. on both the left and the right seems to be on the rise. It won’t recede as long as mob action is tolerated as a way to do politics.<br />A first step in reversing the trend is admitting that the slash-and-burn tactics of both sides are similar. Both justify violence under the banner of “participatory democracy.” Storming the Capitol or burning down a  Starbucks  is the people speaking.</td>

      <td>Inflaming emotions isn’t a crime. The president didn’t mention violence, much less provoke it.</td>
      <td>House Democrats have drafted an article of impeachment that accuses President Trump of “incitement to insurrection.” Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin said Thursday that his office is “looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role” in the Capitol riot. Some reporters have construed that as including Mr. Trump.<br />The president didn’t commit incitement or any other crime. I should know. As a Washington prosecutor I earned the nickname “protester prosecutor” from the antiwar group CodePink. In one trial, I convicted 31 protesters who disrupted congressional traffic by obstructing the Capitol Crypt. In another, I convicted a CodePink activist who smeared her hands with fake blood, charged at then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in a House hearing room, and incited the audience to seize the secretary of state physically. In other cases, I dropped charges when the facts fell short of the legal standard for incitement. One such defendant was the antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan.<br />Hostile journalists and lawmakers have suggested Mr. Trump incited the riot when he told a rally that Republicans need to “fight much harder.” Mr. Trump suggested the crowd walk to the Capitol: “We’re going to cheer on brave senators and congressmen and -women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.”<br />In the District of Columbia, it’s a crime to “intentionally or recklessly act in such a manner to cause another person to be in reasonable fear” and to “incite or provoke violence where there is a likelihood that such violence will ensue.” This language is based on Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), in which the Supreme Court set the standard for speech that could be prosecuted without violating the First Amendment. The justices held that a Ku Klux Klan leader’s calls for violence against blacks and Jews were protected speech. The court found that Clarence Brandenburg’s comments were “mere advocacy” of violence, not “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action . . . likely to incite or produce such action.”<br />The president didn’t mention violence on Wednesday, much less provoke or incite it. He said, “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”</td>

      <td>Practicing medicine was satisfying but not thrilling—so Dr. Pooja Goel began selling cosmetics, hair-care and skin-care products online</td>
      <td>When Pooja Goel was growing up in suburban Maryland, there was little question she would become a doctor. “It was just woven into the background,” she said. She was good at math and science, and her parents made no secret of their hope that their oldest daughter would pursue a career in medicine. “My mom’s sisters are all physicians and they all married physicians,” she said. Nobody on her father’s side had become a doctor, “and it was clear how much he valued that I would be the first.” Besides, she had no other career dreams. Instead, she said, “I was like, ‘This is what’s going to work.’ ”<br />In high school, Ms. Goel applied to B.A./M.D. programs, which prepare students to enter medical school right after college. She got into the hybrid program at Lehigh University and Drexel University’s medical school. “It was the ‘no-worry track,’ ” she recalled. There was a hitch, though: In her junior year, Ms. Goel got a C-minus in organic chemistry, which disqualified her from the medical-school portion of her program. When she spoke with the professor who had given her the bad grade, she remembered him saying, “Maybe your path is something different than medicine.”<br />His words only drove her to prove him wrong. She ended up enrolling at Ross University School of Medicine on the Caribbean island of Dominica. (It has since moved to Barbados). She liked the tropical setting and admired her classmates’ drive. “For a lot of them, medicine was their second career,” she said. Her residency at Philadelphia’s Chestnut Hill Hospital also was a positive experience, especially working at a family medicine clinic.<br />Dr. Goel’s first job was at an urgent care clinic in Maryland. She loved the pace of the work and the on-the-spot problem solving. “There was an element of excitement to my days,” she said. But working 14-hour shifts and coming home at 11 o’clock at night was another thing. She and her husband relocated to New York, where she worked at another urgent care clinic. “I knew I needed some time back,” she said.<br />She moved to a position at New York University’s student health services. For the first time in her career, she had a lunch hour and an eight-hour workday. “I was cooking dinner and doing laundry and roaming around New York,” she said. “I felt human again.” And yet, something was off. “It was better,” she said, “but it still wasn’t me.”</td>

      <td>JAKARTA, Indonesia—Authorities believe they have identified the location of the two so-called black boxes of the Sriwijaya Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea carrying 62 people.<br />Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of Indonesia’s national transportation safety committee, said Sunday that divers were being dispatched to try to recover the cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders.<br />Crews using helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and search-and rescue ships spent the day looking for and retrieving debris from the Boeing 737-500 that went down minutes after taking off from the capital, Jakarta, on Saturday afternoon. Authorities have also found human body parts and expect to use DNA testing to identify the victims, a Jakarta police spokesman said.<br />The plane, which was on a domestic flight to Pontianak on Indonesia’s Borneo island, was delayed before it took off Saturday afternoon due to inclement weather. Shortly after it was airborne, it made an unexpected turn, flying northwest, prompting air-traffic control to ask the plane to report its direction, the transportation ministry said. Seconds later, the aircraft disappeared from the radar, at 2:40 p.m. local time.<br />Authorities began search operations near a series of islands on the outskirts of Jakarta called Kepulauan Seribu, or Thousand Islands. They homed in on the area near Laki Island where the waters appeared of an unusual color and flow, potentially indicating an oil spill and burned fuselage connected to the crash, an air force official, Henri Alfiandi, said in a televised interview Sunday.</td>

      <td>Gains to be driven by a re-emerging economy but won’t offset all pandemic losses</td>
      <td>The U.S. economy is poised to add more jobs this year than any other on records dating back to 1939—though the expected gain is unlikely to fully replace losses last spring, when the coronavirus pandemic first took hold.<br />U.S. nonfarm payrolls will increase by 6.7 million by December 2021, from last month, according to data firm  IHS Markit .  Economic forecasting firm Oxford Economics predicts 5.8 million jobs. Economists at the University of Michigan forecast 5.3 million. All would put 2021 well ahead of the 4.3 million jobs created in 1946, at the start of the post-World War II expansion, for the best year on record. It would be much less in percentage terms, though, 5% versus 11% in 1946.<br />Such gains would be a dramatic turnaround from 2020’s net job loss of 9.4 million, according to the Labor Department’s jobs report Friday. The loss largely occurred in March and April, when employers shed 22 million jobs as states restricted activity to control the spread of the virus. Jobs grew in subsequent months, but the pace eased after June then turned negative in December.<br />Economists expect hiring to start slowly and gain momentum later in 2021, as the Covid-19 vaccine becomes widely available and consumers resume activities such as dining out and travel. The $900 billion in enhanced unemployment benefits, aid to businesses and other relief enacted late last month is also projected to boost the economy.<br />The speed of the recovery would be far faster than after the two previous recessions this century, which mostly reflects the severe and sudden nature of last year’s downturn and the unusual factors at work now in confronting a simultaneous health and economic crisis.</td>

Both companies said Parler hasn’t demonstrated in recent conversations that it can adequately address threats of violence on the platform.<br />“We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity,” Apple said in a statement. “Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety.”<br />The announcements from Amazon and Apple come a day after  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google suspended Parler from its Play Store app marketplace, citing violations of requirements for sufficient moderation of content for apps it distributes.<br />Interest in Parler has risen since November as larger social-network operators such as Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. have become more aggressive in policing content. On Friday, Twitter banned President Trump’s personal account, sparking criticism from conservatives online who felt the effort was biased against them.</td>

      <td>A hockey dad reflects on the long streak of losses  that reinforced his son’s love of the game and turned his team into winners</td>
      <td>Everyone wants what’s best for their kid, but no one knows what that is. It might be succeeding, but it might be failing. It might be winning, but it might be losing.<br />A lot of us who played youth sports remember the defeats far more clearly than the victories—the camaraderie of the locker room, how sweet a candy bar tastes amid bitterness, the foxhole fraternity. You just don’t bond with teammates after a win like you do after a loss. That’s when you learn to express and accept empathy. Even fans of pro teams look back on the losing streaks as a time of testing, a crucible from which the team and its nation of supporters emerge smaller but stronger. Without the wilderness, there is no paradise.<br />The Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a run of 26 straight losses through the 1976 and 1977 NFL seasons. The fans who stuck with them will be fans forever. The Baltimore Orioles started the 1988 baseball season with 21 straight losses, and a local radio broadcaster vowed to stay on the air continuously until they finally won. After LeBron James took his talents to Miami in 2010, the Cleveland Cavaliers suffered 26 straight losses. That’s what distinguishes Cleveland—not LeBron’s return and the championship that followed but the poise the faithful showed in the dark time. Anyone can be graceful in victory. It takes an aristocrat to keep it together when the walls cave in.<br />I’ve relearned this truth as a member of that most pitied and envied of species, the hockey parent. In the course of this second career, I have served as coach and air horn blower, chant leader, heckler and postgame pep talker while watching my son ascend from Mite to Bantam, House League to Travel.<br />In his third season in 2013, my son’s team of 9- and 10-year-olds never lost more than three straight games, won a gold medal at a faux Olympics in Lake Placid—Miracle on Ice!—and made a deep run in the Connecticut State Championship. There was happiness and buffoonery, boasting, celebration, pizza. In short, it was a typically good youth hockey season. He improved as a player but did not much change as a person.</td>

      <td>The wines served at the White House tell us a lot about the president in office at the time. Our wine columnist considers a recent book on the topic and also offers a roundup of White House favorites to uncork now.</td>
      <td>WHEN PRESIDENT-ELECT Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden move into the White House on January 20, what wines will they serve? Will they stick with the tried-and-true picks of their predecessors or select something more daring—a sparkling wine from Texas or Vermont perhaps?<br />As Frederick J. Ryan, Jr., recounts in “Wine and the White House: A History,” some American presidents were more fond of the grape than others, but they all recognized wine’s important political role.<br />Although it was published last fall, Mr. Ryan’s 456-page opus seems even more relevant now as current White House staffers prepare to hand their successors the keys to the cellar. Until reading this book, I’d never given much thought to the selection and service of wines by presidents and their staffers—in fact, I’d never given much thought to certain presidents, such as James Buchanan and Rutherford B. Hayes, at all. But thanks to Mr. Ryan I learned that the former liked wine so much he eventually drank himself into gout, while the latter liked wine so little he had to be all but forced to pull some corks. (His teetotaler wife was nicknamed “Lemonade Lucy.”)<br />President Harry S. Truman was apparently just as stingy with the juice. He served, it’s noted, a single glass of Champagne to guests before dinners, while during the meal “the process of refilling the empty wineglasses was deliberately slow.”<br />Wine is an excellent prism through which to consider past presidents and their accomplishments or misdeeds (or both). Take, for example, Richard M. Nixon. While the 37th president may have resigned in disgrace, he is also responsible for putting Schramsberg, the Napa Valley sparkling-wine producer, on the map when he served a 1969 Schramsberg Blanc de Blancs to Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1972 in a toast to the breakthrough in American-Chinese relations.</td>

      <td>Connecticut’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout has been relatively smooth, health officials said, while the U.S. and many states lag behind their original distribution plans.<br />The state has administered about half its allotted doses, compared with neighboring New York, which has administered nearly one-third of its allotment, and New Jersey, with little more than a quarter of its doses distributed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Across the U.S., about 28% of all the first doses have been administered, according to the CDC.<br />The shortfall is due in part to a lag in reporting data, government officials and health experts said. But as the federal government has left it to states to determine what to do with the vaccines, and with some states pushing decision-making to local health departments and hospitals, the process has hit snags in many places.<br />Connecticut hospital executives said open lines of communication with Gov. Ned Lamont’s office and the Connecticut Department of Public Health, along with good coordination among the state’s hospitals have been important factors during the first phase. About 300,000 health-care and long-term care workers are eligible for the first phase.<br />“Our hospital systems, our federally qualified health centers and our local health departments have been successful in standing up very large clinics in very short order and getting those employees into those clinics and getting them vaccinated,” the state’s acting health commissioner, Deidre Gifford, said.</td>

Those include blocking some Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies Co. from obtaining certain components made by U.S. or foreign suppliers, or accessing U.S. technology.<br />While the rules didn’t name any specific foreign laws or sanctions, they amp up pressure against U.S. and other foreign companies with a footprint in China, possibly forcing them to choose between American or Chinese regulations, according to people in the foreign business community.<br />They also come as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office this month, presenting him with the question of whether to overturn Trump administration actions targeted at China.</td>

      <td>How the singer’s newly folksy, ‘cottagecore’-inflected look is being enthusiastically imitated and decoded by her ‘Swiftie’ fans</td>
      <td>HATERS WILL say it’s just a braid. Simply a messy French braid hanging down the back of a young woman, alone in the woods. Nothing to it, right? Of course, the woman is Taylor Swift—captured in the stark, unassuming photo on the cover of “Evermore,” the album she released last month just a few days shy of her 31st birthday, and five months after its sister album “Folklore.” In the liner notes for “Evermore,” Ms. Swift called the album a gift for her fans. The cover bears neither the album’s nor Taylor Swift’s name, not even her face. Just one poignant braid—another offering in the form of a new signature hairstyle, destined to be decoded and imitated for years to come.<br />Ms. Swift is one of a tiny coterie of international stars (Beyoncé and Rihanna also come to mind) whose every aesthetic decision is deeply intentional and inevitably influential; her passionate fandom of millions of “Swifties” study every move she makes. “Evermore” was Ms. Swift’s eighth studio album to sell a million copies in a week and the question of female authorship is an intrinsic part of this superstar’s narrative—and her battles with streaming services. Whether she purposefully twisted 31 turns into her braid for each year of her life (as Swifties have speculated) is unconfirmed, and her team did not provide comment. However, in Taylor Swift’s storytelling-heavy world, a braid is certainly not just a braid.<br />For those fans, the slightly scruffy hairstyle is achievable because it’s legitimately natural. Living in relative isolation along with the rest of us, Ms. Swift styled herself for the album cover. A French braid is the kind of hairstyle you might attempt if you found yourself alone in the forest and feeling a little wistful, listening to old songs by Emmylou Harris and Joni Mitchell—both of whom Ms. Swift have named as influences. The artist has recently flirted with the “cottagecore” aesthetic, referring to the online enthusiasm for all things twee and prairie-flavored (think baskets, aprons and lacy nightgowns).<br />Erin Bliss, a 25-year-old Swiftie in Minot, N.D., who painstakingly embroidered a depiction of the “Evermore” braid onto cloth and posted it to TikTok, mused, “She is in those woods, she’s still isolated. I think we’re all kind of feeling that way with the pandemic and everything and I think that we’re looking for ways to escape and ‘Evermore’ and ‘Folklore’ definitely provide that level of escapism.”<br />The minute the album art appeared online, fans began painstakingly recreating it in photos of their own, from the winter sky to the French braid to the woodsy plaid coat (Ms. Swift’s was made by eco-friendly designer and collaborator Stella McCartney). Kristyne Marie Gooden, a 30-year-old marketer in Orlando, Fla. who does Taylor Swift impersonations, said that when the surprise album dropped she initially “took a full 10 minutes to lose my mind.” Then, “the first thing I did after I calmed down was braid my hair, immediately.” She posted her faithful facsimile of the album art to Instagram, where it racked up thousands of likes, more than any image she’d ever posted.</td>

The decision came after council representatives visited Sinovac’s factory in China last year and conducted a halal audit.<br />Part of the challenge of rolling out vaccines world-wide will be persuading enough people to take them to reach herd immunity. In many countries, Muslim and non-Muslim, the efforts must overcome safety concerns, suspicions and conspiracy theories, as well as religious and ethical objections.<br />Gelatin taken from pigs and cells created using tissue from human fetuses, which are both common in vaccine production, are aren’t halal, Muslim scholars say.<br />Acceptance of vaccinations before the coronavirus pandemic varied widely among Muslim countries, with high trust in countries like Bangladesh and Uzbekistan, according to a study of opinion in 149 countries published in September 2020 in the Lancet medical journal. It found that of the 10 countries with the most marked drop in confidence in vaccines over the four years through 2019, seven were predominantly Muslim: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Pakistan. The other three were Japan, Georgia and Serbia.</td>

      <td>Prime Minister Conte fights for survival, as he wrestles with former Premier Renzi over how to spend EU funds aimed at helping Italy</td>
      <td>ROME—In the depths of the pandemic, one sign of normality is returning to Italy: political instability.<br />The government of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is struggling to avoid collapse after a small coalition member threatened to withdraw vital parliamentary support. The Italia Viva party, led by former Italian Premier Matteo Renzi, has long been skeptical of Mr. Conte’s leadership and is raising pressure on a range of issues, including how to reconstruct Italy’s battered economy after the pandemic.<br />If Mr. Renzi pulls out of the coalition, forcing Mr. Conte to resign, the possible outcomes range from a new government with the same center-left leaders to snap elections that a rival center-right alliance would likely win.<br />Many observers predict Mr. Conte will continue, albeit with Mr. Renzi’s small party having more clout. Whatever the outcome, the tussle shows that the surprising stability of Italian politics during the pandemic is coming to an end.<br />Mr. Conte, a little-known law professor chosen to lead two rickety coalition governments in 2018 and 2019, has become an unexpectedly strong premier since last year, when Italy became the first Western country severely struck by Covid-19. His approval ratings rose as he worked with allies and opposition parties to orchestrate the first lockdown of a whole country, using rigorous measures that were soon adopted around the world.</td>

      <td>After a two-year renovation of the skylights and roof of the Met, many of the museum’s European masterpieces have never looked better.</td>
      <td><br />For the past two years, about half of the old master galleries at the top of the grand staircase of the Metropolitan Museum of Art have been closed for phase one of a four-year project to repair and upgrade the roof and skylights over that part of the building. Since the skylights date from 1939 and were last remodeled in 1952, the work was desperately needed; buckets to catch leaks were apparently a permanent fixture above the ceilings. Now, 21 galleries have reopened with “A New Look at Old Masters,” a freshly rethought installation of works from the 13th to the early 19th centuries. It’s an engaging mix of old friends, greatest hits and surprises, described as “a prelude to the final, extensive reinstallation of the European paintings galleries,” two years hence when the project is completed.<br />The magical flood of natural light from the new skylights will vary with the time of day and the season (with strategic artificial supplements when necessary). Thanks to sophisticated, state-of-the-art baffles and high-tech glass, the light is perfectly modulated, with no shadows. Works we’ve loved all our lives have never looked better, while some that we may have slighted in the past demand and reward attention in thought-provoking groupings and comparisons that reveal the wealth and depth of the collection. Some galleries seem a little crowded, especially given social-distancing protocols, but that’s unavoidable, given the abundance of notable holdings and the reduced exhibition space currently available; the pleasure of seeing so many stellar works more than compensates. (Dutch Golden Age paintings remain downstairs, in the Lehman Wing.)<br />Organized thematically and chronologically, but not in strict sequence, the installation underlines the aesthetic desiderata of various times and places, and brings to life relationships among artists, revealing similarities and differences, influences and rejections. Occasionally, sculpture and selections from the decorative arts collection enlarge our conception of the taste of a moment. The text panels throughout are minimal but informative, with lucid discussions of such vexed issues as the ideology surrounding depictions of enslaved people and Africans in the Renaissance and Baroque periods, opportunities for women artists, and the foundation of the fortune of the Met’s munificent benefactors H.O. and Louisine Havemeyer in the sugar industry, placed near works that trigger questions.<br />We begin with “Baroque Europe, Between Naturalism and Theatricality”: dramatically lighted religious motifs enacted by large figures, painted by Italian and Spanish luminaries. The installation evokes the lively mix of international artists in Rome in the early 17th century and the influence those artists exerted. Diego Velázquez’s early, straightforward “The Supper at Emmaus” and Caravaggio’s brooding, cinematic “The Denial of St. Peter” embody, when placed together, the polarities of the gallery’s theme. Caravaggio’s potent influence is evident in theatrically lighted scenes by Guercino and Jusepe de Ribera, the expat Spaniard who maintained Caravaggism in Naples. A luminous Guido Reni offers an alternative, lyrical approach, while muscular naturalism is announced by Bernardo Strozzi’s “Tobias Curing His Father’s Blindness.”</td>

It actually inspired him to run a marathon—in his South Korean hotel room.<br />Some people like Mr. Marett have gotten creative with their fitness routines during the pandemic, using online tools to set new goals for themselves and motivate them to hit new personal bests. Here’s what you can learn from these ambitious exercisers to help you set and achieve goals of every scope.<br />Mr. Marett, a 33-year-old staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force, moved his bed sideways to create an indoor oval running course and used the activity tracker Strava to determine that 85 laps equaled about a mile.<br />“It began as a simple 1-mile run, some calisthenics, and 1 more mile,” he says. “But I began looking at running certain distances as a unique challenge. I started with a 5k, completed a 10k, 15k and half marathon in successive days, gave myself three days off and ran a full marathon.”<br />He completed the 26.2 miles in four hours, 27 minutes and 28 seconds; 2,227 laps around the room. He posted Strava snapshots of his quarantine runs to a virtual run group on  Facebook  and says the support kept him motivated to reach the marathon distance.</td>

      <td>SEOUL—North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the country’s approach to the U.S. wouldn’t change no matter who the president is, promising to advance its nuclear weapon program.<br />Mr. Kim, speaking at a rare Workers’ Party Congress meeting, made his lengthiest remarks about the U.S. in months, although he didn’t mention President-elect Joe Biden by name. Washington and Pyongyang remain stalemated on nuclear talks that haven’t shown discernible progress for nearly two years following the abrupt end to talks in Hanoi.<br />“Our biggest enemy and main hurdle is the U.S.,” said Mr. Kim, according to text of the remarks published by state media Saturday.<br />The key to Washington-Pyongyang relations, Mr. Kim said, was the U.S. dropping its hostile policy toward the North. That Kim regime assertion over the years has meant everything from U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and throughout Asia, their joint military drills and international discussion about the North’s human rights violations.<br />But the North Korean leader’s remarks about the U.S. were measured by Pyongyang’s saber-rattling standards. Mr. Kim didn’t make any imminent promise to launch missiles or threaten military action. He even referred to the North as being a “responsible nuclear weapons owner.”</td>

The tech giant said in order for Parler to remain available in the App Store, it had to provide detailed information on its content-moderation plans and “what you will do to improve moderation and content filtering your service for this kind of objectionable content going forward.”<br />Apple set a deadline of 24 hours for Parler’s compliance.<br />Launched in 2018, Parler has billed itself as a free-speech friendly and content-recommendation free alternative to larger social networks such as  Facebook  and  Twitter .  It has exploded in popularity in the run-up to and after the 2020 U.S. presidential election<br />While Parler bans spam, threats of violence and other illegal activity, its rules don’t prohibit hate speech and false information.</td>

      <td>The economy is poised for a boom in 2021 after a December setback.</td>
      <td>Equity markets took in stride Friday’s labor report showing 140,000 job losses in December, and that sounds right. The slump is the clear and unsurprising result of renewed state lockdowns amid the latest Covid-19 surge. But the economy looks poised for a boom in 2021, with another jobs acceleration, once vaccines roll out and the virus emergency subsides.<br />Leisure and hospitality accounted for the bulk of the job losses (498,000), as states such as Washington, Michigan and Pennsylvania banned indoor dining. California even barred restaurants from serving outdoors amid a broad lockdown that closed most personal services. New unemployment claims in California alone last month totalled more than 710,000.<br />Yet the jobless rate stayed at 6.7% as most lockdown losses were offset by strong job growth in such industries as manufacturing (38,000), construction (51,000) and even retail (120,500). Employment in residential construction grew by some 57,200 in 2020.<br />Employment is also up 172,100 year-over-year at big-box retailers like  Walmart ,   Costco  and  Target .  They’ve been growing fast to compete with  Amazon .  The pandemic shift to online commerce has created 223,200 new jobs in couriers and 103,500 in warehouses over the last year. Most new jobs tied to online commerce aren’t going away once the virus ebbs.<br />Payrolls were also revised up 135,000 for October and November, which underscores the strong job growth before states tightened business restrictions. Permanent layoffs also fell 348,000 last month while temporary layoffs increased 277,000, which suggests plans to rehire workers once restrictions ease.</td>

      <td>The House Speaker publicizes her nuclear option to protect the world from Trump.</td>
      <td>We scoured the U.S. Constitution Friday afternoon and it’s definitely not there: the provision allowing the Speaker of the House of Representatives to intervene in the military chain of command to protect the world from President Trump.<br />Mrs. Pelosi told her Democratic colleagues that she spoke Friday morning to Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “to discuss available precautions for preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike.” She posted the “Dear colleague” letter on her website to make sure the world got the message. A spokesman for Gen. Milley told reporters the chairman “answered her questions.”<br />The press and left-wing  Twitter  (we repeat ourselves) love the idea of the Speaker inserting herself into the chain of command as a rebuke to an erratic President. But it’s an abuse of her own power, which is limited to leading the legislative branch unless both the President and Vice President are incapacitated or removed from office. In that case she is third in line for the Presidency.<br />But in the meantime she has no business telling the Joint Chiefs not to follow the President’s orders. Gen. Milley hardly needs the lecture, as he has been dealing with Mr. Trump for 15 months and isn’t about to indulge an unlawful order, much less an effort to launch nuclear weapons.<br />Mrs. Pelosi’s call to Gen. Milley is itself a violation of the separation of powers by seeking to inject herself into an executive-branch military decision. She can offer advice all she wants, but this call at this time has the sound of an order. It might even be construed by some as its own little coup—conniving with the military to relieve of command the person who remains the elected President.</td>

      <td>With the tumult in America this week, readers may have missed the ominous news from Hong Kong, where police arrested more than 50 former lawmakers and dissenters on Wednesday. The list includes one American, and the roundup is an early test for the Biden Administration.<br />The prisoners were arrested for their roles as candidates or organizers of a pro-democracy primary election last July. Some 600,000 Hong Kongers voted in the primary, which isn’t part of the formal political process but which would have determined who challenged pro-Beijing candidates in the 2020 Legislative Council elections. The Communist Party fears an electoral humiliation after pro-democracy district council candidates won in a landslide in the November 2019 election.<br />Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, Beijing’s agent, warned last July that if the pro-democracy camp tried to gain Legislative Council seats to resist Beijing’s agenda, that “may fall into the category of subverting state power.” Authorities later postponed the legislative elections, and the arrests make clear that now even campaigning as a pro-democracy candidate is a crime under China’s new national-security law. This is what Russia has done with opposition candidate Alexei Navalny.<br />The arrested include Benny Tai, who helped with the logistics of the primary; former lawmaker Alvin Yeung, an outspoken defender of the independent judiciary; former legislator Claudia Mo; union organizer Carol Ng; and Jimmy Sham, who organized protests that turned out millions in 2019 and was attacked by thugs wielding hammers.<br />Also snatched was Hong Kong resident and American human-rights lawyer John Clancey, who served as treasurer for a pro-democracy political group. He and many of the others arrested this week have since been released on bail. Yet they could face re-imprisonment at any time, like media tycoon Jimmy Lai, whose bail was revoked last month and is behind bars awaiting trial over the 2019 protests. Under the new national-security law, the maximum sentence is life in prison. The arrests show that Hong Kong is now thoroughly under the Communist Party’s rule and any dissent will be punished.</td>

      <td>After raising tax rates, Gov. Murphy increases corporate welfare.</td>
      <td>Perhaps the biggest winners in the Georgia Senate runoffs are Democratic states banking on federal budget relief. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is already cashing his future check with $14 billion in new state business subsidies to mitigate his Covid-19 lockdown and corporate tax hike.<br />“Tax incentives should be used strategically and sparingly,” Mr. Murphy said in 2019. He added that “to those who bemoan our inability to pay for even the most basic items in our budget, let me say,” spending $1 billion a year on corporate subsidies “simply put, is nuts.” The Governor let the tax breaks lapse.<br />He’s now back to “nuts.” Legislation he signed Thursday provides $11.5 billion in tax breaks over seven years for real-estate projects as well as businesses that keep and create jobs in the state. Another $2.6 billion in tax credits are for film production.<br />Mr. Murphy says the tax breaks are needed to help businesses hurt by the pandemic—i.e., his excessive business shutdowns. New Jersey’s 10.2% unemployment rate in November was the highest in the country. But last year he extended the state’s “temporary” corporate tax hike and borrowed $4 billion to avoid spending cuts. Trenton Democrats in 2018 raised the state’s top corporate rate to 11.5% from 9% for businesses with more than $1 million in income. That gave New Jersey the highest rate in the country after Iowa (12%). The tax increase was supposed to fall to 10.5% last year and sunset after 2021, but Democrats, no surprise, extended the 11.5% rate through 2023.<br />Now Democrats are offering a salve to politically favored businesses, thus completing the cycle of political life in New Jersey: Make rich promises to public unions, increase taxes and borrowing to pay for them, and then spend to keep businesses and jobs from leaving. Revenues have improved in New Jersey since the spring, but the budget is still bleeding from unsustainable pension obligations.</td>

      <td>Go ahead and laugh. But if we’re such a joke state, why are all of your neighbors moving here?</td>
      <td>St. Petersburg, Fla.<br />Florida remains the Rodney Dangerfield of states, admired by some but derided by many. In his book “Best. State. Ever: A Florida Man Defends His Homeland,” Dave Barry laments that his adopted home is considered a “joke state.” But even Mr. Barry concedes that Florida, “because of its unique shape and warm climate, does have an unusually high percentage of low IQ people doing stupid things, frequently naked.” Last year, a study ranked Florida the country’s 28th smartest state. The headline in the Miami Herald was: “Florida is not the dumbest state in the union. Are you surprised?”<br />Florida may indeed be a kind of national punching bag, thanks in large part to the proliferation of crazy Florida Man stories that go viral. Since I moved here with my wife and two children in 2019, I regularly receive messages from friends from as far afield as Liechtenstein and Colombia alluding to Florida’s reputation as a generally idiotic place. During spring break, images of crowded Florida beaches, full of revelers—many of them out-of-towners—were plastered around the world as proof that Floridians are just a brain cell or two superior to sloths.<br />I got the feeling that many in the media and the population at large hoped that a calamity would befall us, so they could crow about how we got what we deserved. The pandemic has taken a toll here, but the per capita Covid-19 death rate in Florida is 23rd in the country, well behind strict lockdown states like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Illinois, Michigan and many others.<br />Florida is picked on reflexively, regardless of the situation, perhaps because bullies in the media are too dumb or unoriginal to vary their targets. When friends visit us, they are surprised to discover cities with character, like St. Augustine and St. Petersburg, because they’ve bought into the media narrative that Florida is nothing more than strip malls, subdivisions and brain-dead fools frying in the sun. Perhaps now is the time to reassess whether Florida deserves its status as the nation’s laughingstock.</td>

And it wasn’t because they weren’t forewarned or lacked intelligence on what was about to happen. Indeed, they had experienced a nearly identical situation with a KKK rally weeks before.<br />But in one way America isn’t a banana republic: Police will do almost anything to avoid firing into a crowd to interrupt lawbreaking or even risk the possibility. This also was true during the George Floyd protests, when police in New York flashed their lights and squawked on bullhorns but didn’t get out of their cars to stop store looters because it wasn’t worth risking lives to save a few $1,200 sweaters.<br />In the end, most of the invaders of the Capitol behaved more like tourists than insurrectionists, allowing themselves to be herded out when police had assembled a superior force. It could have been much worse but wasn’t because sense was prevalent on both sides.<br />A careful postmortem in Charlottesville showed that protesters are like your children: Each one is different. Political activists, gawkers and journalists show up as well as hatemongers of every description, drawn by a hope of mayhem and not overly observant of partisan narratives adopted for the convenience of the media. Was President Trump warned that threats to the Capitol had been circulating online for weeks? He should have been—in which case he might well worry about a charge of incitement.<br />If the storming of the Capitol finally inoculates voters against the worst tendencies of Trumpism, notice this goal was not vouchsafed by four years of Democrats and the media trying to counter Trump by emulating him, with false narratives and tortured or falsified evidence.</td>

Objections will be heard, evidence will be presented, and the elected representatives of the American people will make their decision.<br />Our Founders created the Electoral College in 1787, and it first convened in 1789. With the advent of political parties, the Electoral College was amended in 1804 to provide that Electors vote separately for President and Vice President. Following a contentious election in 1876, with widespread allegations of fraud and malfeasance, Congress spent a decade establishing rules and procedures to govern the counting of electoral votes and the resolution of any objections.<br />During the 130 years since the Electoral Count Act was passed, Congress has, without exception, used these formal procedures to count the electoral votes every four years.</td>

João Doria. Only two months ago, Mr. Bolsonaro told his supporters the vaccine, CoronaVac, could kill or disable them, without offering evidence, and refused to buy it.<br />But over the past few months, the Chinese vaccine has emerged as one of Brazil’s best bets to fight a pandemic that has cost the lives of more than 200,000 people here, second only to the U.S.<br />The Health Ministry said late Thursday that it had signed a contract with the Butantan Institute, the São Paulo state research center that has been testing and producing CoronaVac, to buy 46 million doses. The ministry said it has the option to buy another 54 million, enough to immunize 50 million people with the two dose-shot, or about a quarter of Brazil’s population.<br />Latin America is racing to secure doses as cases surge across the region. Hundreds of thousands of more people tested positive in Latin America this week, after many defied government warnings and held big family gatherings over the holidays and packed beaches at the start of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer. With only 8% of the world’s population, Latin America has accounted for nearly 30% of Covid-19 deaths.</td>

      <td>Artist-explorer Albert Bierstadt’s “A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie” looms as large in American cultural history as the towering peaks he depicts.</td>
      <td>In mid-June 1863,the celebrated German-born American painter Albert Bierstadt ventured by wagon into the high Rocky Mountains west of Denver, scouting scenes for a Colorado painting. When he got to the area below the Chicago Lakes, he was “in raptures with the scenery,” according to his companion. Soon he unpacked his brushes and paints to make an oil sketch.<br />So began Bierstadt’s work on his majestic “A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie” (1866), a 7-by-12-foot magnum opus that is one of the most prized artworks in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. Created in the gloomy Civil War era, the painting conveys the grandeur of the American West at a time when the nation’s belief in Manifest Destiny roused hopes and dreams even for citizens who were not headed west. Studded with emblems of the frontier—a soaring eagle, a black bear, pristine lakes, big skies, steep cliffs and a Native American camp—“A Storm” is, in the words of art historian Linda Ferber, writing in the museum’s 2006 “American Paintings in the Brooklyn Museum: Artists Born by 1876,” “a pivotal work in American cultural history.”<br />Bierstadt (1830-1902), who relished the role of artist-explorer that was blazed in Latin America by his contemporary Frederic Edwin Church, was painting for people who had little knowledge of Western terrain. For this scene of untamed nature, he chose a dramatic moment, cloaking his landscape in three weather patterns—a threatening thunderstorm in the craggy, snowcapped mountains in the distance; dazzling sunshine on the lower mountains and a misty lake in the middle-ground; and a fertile grassland in the foreground, where Indians race with their horses toward their teepees, possibly in anticipation of the storm.<br />At work in the Tenth Street Studio Building in Manhattan, Bierstadt referred to many drawings and oil sketches he made on his 1863 travels. He painted details like the grasses, ferns, wildflowers and animals meticulously, as correct renditions of nature. But to make this bold, stirring landscape, he also embellished—exaggerating geological features or adjusting their placement, using rich colors, and brilliantly heightening light and shadow effects to magnify the theatricality of his work.<br />Perhaps the small Native American camp in the left foreground was Bierstadt’s biggest stretch. No writings from this trip, or his two others to the West, suggest that he actually came face-to-face with Indians. He simply decided to insert them, engaged in a hunt (notice the dead deer). This invention allowed Bierstadt to convey the grand scale of the Rockies and, more important, to give the painting a human narrative, albeit one that exoticizes and romanticizes the West. Bierstadt was careful to paint their gear, like a blanket and saddle, accurately, scholars say, but he makes no allusion to the U.S. government’s drive to force Native Americans off their lands.</td>

      <td>The conventional wisdom is to wait as long as possible. But that isn’t always the best advice.</td>
      <td>One of the most complicated and consequential decisions in retirement—when to start collecting Social Security—has been transformed by online calculators.<br />The conventional wisdom says that you should wait to claim benefits as long as possible, to maximize your payments. But one size doesn’t fit all, and people’s circumstances are often different than the standard assumptions about expected lifespan and career plans.<br />That’s where these calculators are useful. Put in your age and your spouse’s age, as well as information from your Social Security statement, and the calculators will tell you when you should each begin benefits to get the most money over your lifetimes.<br />And, most important, you can easily adjust the numbers based on your individual situation and see what you stand to gain or lose. If you think there’s information that the formulas aren’t taking into account, plug in a different number. For instance, you know if people in your families are short-lived or long-lived—but the algorithms don’t. The difference between what you get and what the calculator gives you originally can be striking.<br />There are a number of calculators to choose from. Some are free, such as Open Social Security, and some charge a fee, like Social Security Solutions or Maximize My Social Security.</td>

      <td>Then-Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen pressed ahead in December 2015 with the central bank’s first interest rate increase in nearly a decade despite several colleagues’ misgivings over global economic weakness and weak inflation pressures, according to transcripts of the policy meeting released Friday.<br />Ms. Yellen, who has been nominated by President-elect Joe Biden to serve as Treasury secretary, argued for raising short-term rates to slow hiring and pre-empt inflationary pressures that could require more aggressive rate increases later.<br />“We would want to check the pace of employment growth somewhat to reduce the risk of overheating that could eventually force us to tighten abruptly,” she said at the Dec. 16 meeting. The decision to lift interest rates from near zero after holding them there for seven years was approved unanimously by the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.<br />But Ms. Yellen allowed for the risk that inflation dynamics weren’t operating as they had in prior periods, which is what transpired. “A more radical rethinking…would surely be in order,” she said, if inflation remained “persistently subdued…despite further improvements in the labor market.”<br />The Fed publishes a written summary of its policy meetings after a three-week delay, but these minutes don’t include verbatim quotes or identify speakers by name. Transcripts of the discussions providing those details are released after more than five years. The Fed on Friday released the transcripts of all its 2015 FOMC meetings.</td>

Sicknick, was struck in the head with a fire extinguisher during Wednesday’s unrest, according to a law-enforcement official. After he was injured, he returned to his division office and collapsed, the Capitol Police said, and was taken to a local hospital. Mr. Sicknick, 42 years old, died of his injuries at 9:30 p.m. Thursday.<br />The Capitol Police said his death would be investigated by the homicide branch of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, the Capitol Police and federal investigators. Prosecutors are also exploring the possibility of federal charges in connection with the death.<br />The youngest of three sons born in South River, N.J., Mr. Sicknick had wanted to be a police officer his entire life, according to a statement from his family. He joined the New Jersey Air National Guard, deploying to Saudi Arabia in 1999 and Kyrgyzstan in 2003, according to the Guard.<br />“Many details regarding Wednesday’s events and the direct causes of Brian’s injuries remain unknown and our family asks the public and the press to respect our wishes in not making Brian’s passing a political issue,” the family said in a statement provided by Mr. Sicknick’s brother, Ken. “Brian is a hero and that is what we would like people to remember.”</td>

The number of such crossings has fallen since the huge surge of migrants entering Europe in 2015.<br />The global pandemic has pushed down migration, both legal and illegal, as countries have closed borders, restricted routes for legal migration and scaled back programs to take in refugees. Covid-19 travel restrictions inside countries and along borders have also made smuggling more dangerous and expensive, experts said, although it hasn’t halted the activity altogether.<br />In Europe, the year started out with a surge in crossings from Turkey to Greece—a route used by Middle Eastern migrants and refugees, notably from Syria—but those numbers ultimately fell.<br />In February, the Turkish government signaled that it would no longer abide by a 2016 agreement it struck with the EU to stop large-scale migration.

      <td>Rising infections and new, highly contagious strains of the coronavirus are pressuring governments to accelerate vaccinations</td>
      <td>Countries around the world are accelerating their efforts to vaccinate their populations against Covid-19 in response to rising infections, public pressure, and fear of new, highly contagious variants of the coronavirus.<br />In an emerging race between the virus and vaccinations, some countries that previously took a cautious approach to authorizing and procuring vaccines, such as South Korea and Australia, are now bringing forward their timetables. Some other countries that were already pushing to inoculate swaths of their population quickly, such as the U.K. and Israel, are looking to further speed up their rollouts.<br />A year into the pandemic, the growing urgency behind vaccination programs shows how most of the world is still struggling to contain the virus with social-distancing measures alone. Stubbornly high infections, pressure on hospitals, public weariness with restrictions on everyday life and fear of accumulating economic damage are prompting many governments to hasten their vaccination plans. But in much of the world, ambitious timetables face obstacles including a shortage of available vaccine doses, logistical challenges and mixed levels of public willingness to get inoculated.<br />South Korea and Australia have brought forward the launch of their vaccination programs to February, about a month earlier than planned, in response to fresh outbreaks and concerns about the economic impact of rising contagion. Both countries were confident until recently they had tamed Covid-19 and therefore could afford to take time to authorize and distribute the new vaccines.<br />South Korea, seen as a model of how to limit contagion, took a particularly cautious approach to new vaccines last year, citing potential side effects and arguing that time was needed to negotiate better prices with pharmaceutical companies. After  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech  SE said in November their vaccine was 95% effective, South Korea’s health minister expressed surprise Pfizer had asked if the country wanted to place an order. It didn’t for weeks.</td>

      <td>From the 2020 primaries to the post-election furor, the founders’ system of election by states proved its democratic value.</td>
      <td>Scholars, pundits and progressives widely despise the Electoral College. They think it antiquated, irrational and undemocratic and argue for scrapping it in favor of a national popular vote.<br />But in 2020, when many hallowed American institutions submitted to street demonstrations and violence, the Electoral College proved a steadfast guardian of democracy. It can’t solve our problems on its own, but has given us a measure of stability to try for ourselves. A national popular election in 2020 would have made our problems immeasurably worse.<br />The essential feature of the Electoral College is voting for president by states. Each state has electoral votes equal to its delegation in the U.S. Congress—representatives (one for Vermont, 14 for Michigan, 53 for California, etc.) plus two senators. State legislatures determine the “manner” of casting their electoral votes, and 48 of them allocate those votes on a winner-take-all basis to the national ticket that receives the highest state popular vote. Maine and Nebraska select two electors by statewide vote and the remainder by congressional district.<br />As part of this design, states manage presidential elections along with those for other offices. They establish standards and procedures for voter eligibility, candidate ballot listing, mail-in voting, vote counting, challenges and recounts. The Constitution sets Inauguration Day as Jan. 20; federal statutes set a uniform Election Day in early November and a careful sequence of intermediate dates—for states to certify their election results and cast their electoral votes in December, and for their receipt by a joint session of Congress Jan. 6. To be elected president, a candidate must receive a majority of the electoral votes—at least 270 of the total 538.<br />Electoral votes are cast individually by electors, who gather in their state capitals in December. The Constitution’s framers conceived of electors as intermediaries between voters and candidates, but political parties soon assumed this role, choosing party stalwarts as electors pledged to their candidates. That has made the Electoral College assemblies largely ceremonial (there have been occasional “faithless electors,” but states can replace or penalize them). Still, newspapers ran many stories about electors who trekked to their state capitals to cast their votes on Dec. 14—diligently engaged in a constitutional practice that runs back to the election of George Washington in 1789.</td>

      <td>After nearly a year of vacation deprivation, frustrated globe-trotters are starting to dream about traveling freely again. We highlight six getaway goals for 2021 and new ways to realize each one.</td>
      <td>LINDA LAU IS looking forward to being jet-lagged as hell, sipping soju and dining at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Seoul with a bunch of strangers. This October, she hopes to attend the kickoff dinner of a “culinary retreat” to South Korea that she was supposed to take in fall 2020—that is, before the pandemic stopped travel cold. The rollout of Covid vaccines is giving her—and many of us—confidence to begin planning trips again. In a survey conducted in December 2020 by research firm Destination Analysts, over 53% of U.S. respondents said the vaccine made them optimistic that they can travel safely within the next six months; more than 80% said they have “at least tentative” plans right now.<br />Getting vaccinated, however, shouldn’t be seen as an immediate passport back to our former easygoing travel habits, cautions Dr. Lin Chen, president of the International Society of Travel Medicine and director of the Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. “There’s a little bit of data that suggests we may have reduced ability to transmit or carry” the virus, post vaccination, said Dr. Chen, “but it’s not enough.” More encouraging data may emerge, but, for now, even vaccinated travelers who hit the road before herd immunity is achieved—which Dr. Chen hopes might happen by fall in some regions—should continue to take precautions. That means wearing masks, distancing and observing other safety measures to protect the unvaccinated and the vulnerable.<br />Still, planning abounds. Troy Haas, president and CEO of Birmingham, Ala.-based Brownell Travel, sees people making travel arrangements as a form of self-care. “People just want the ability to find small ways to draw some joy back into life with travel and human connection,” he said. “Travel is a drink of water in a parched life.”<br />Here, we present six typical goals this year—from planning a getaway with the extended family to fleeing the pod for some overdue time alone—plus a few suggestions on how to achieve them. And since the international travel landscape could change dramatically in the coming months, we also offer a few domestic travel options. Even if you’re not ready to commit to vacation plans just yet, the following should help quench some of that travel thirst.<br />The Goal Zoom calls with the extended family are growing tiresome. Your first priority is getting the whole gang back together in the flesh.</td>

      <td>The ratification debates of 1787-88 were colored by ‘patriotic enthusiasms’ verging on violent chaos.</td>
      <td>What should statesmen do when public passions go awry? On Jan. 6, pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol, breaking windows, interrupting the certification of the 2020 election results, and forcing the evacuation of lawmakers. The chaotic scene turned tragic when one person was shot and killed in the melee. This was unquestionably an example of unhinged enthusiasm, of passions run amok.<br />Immanuel Kant once remarked that nothing great has ever been done without passion. But passion, when improperly managed, can do great harm. During the debates over the ratification of the Constitution in 1787-88, the Federalists sought to manage public enthusiasm by enlisting passion on the side of reason. They did so to unify the nation. And we can learn from them.<br />Americans like to think that the writing and ratification of the Constitution consisted of calm reflection and choice. But the ratification debates were, as the scholar Michael Faber recently put it, a “knock-down, drag-out fight.”<br />Elbridge Gerry, a delegate at the Federal Convention who refused to sign the Constitution, was burned in effigy in Massachusetts. George Mason of Virginia, who also withheld his signature, was encouraged by the mayor of Alexandria to leave town shortly after his arrival, given the great threat to his personal safety. Mobs forced Anti-Federalists in Pennsylvania to return to the state Assembly and hurriedly set a date for the state’s ratifying convention.<br />The Anti-Federalist Richard Henry Lee wrote to Samuel Adams, expressing disappointment that “the Agitators of this new system” were resorting to mob violence to rush the ratification of the Constitution, “as if the subject of Government were a business of passion, instead of cool, sober, and intense consideration.”</td>

Then, cold December weather triggered another big increase in joblessness.<br />December’s 140,000 drop in payrolls was the first since April. But unlike in April, December’s job losses were concentrated in the leisure and hospitality industries, said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at job site ZipRecruiter.</td>

Thompson. Together, artist and writer produced a body of work in magazine articles and books that became known as “Gonzo” for its unhinged subjectivity and anti-authoritarian outlook.<br />Mr. Steadman’s famed illustrations for “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,” Thompson’s autobiographical 1971 novel about his drug-fueled adventures, are a mixture of grotesque portraiture and geometrically precise landscape. A car driven by two screaming lunatics careens across a desert consisting of horizontal lines and a few felt-tip cactuses. In the distance, the looming skyscrapers that herald their Las Vegas destination are depicted by dozens of tightly packed vertical lines of differing lengths.<br />Now 84, Mr. Steadman, looks back on his career as a cartoonist in “A Life In Ink,” an illustrated memoir published by Chronicle Chroma in November. He credits the precision of his draughtsmanship to his time as an apprentice aircraft engineer in the 1950s. “I had to do endless circles and straight lines and that’s where that comes from in my illustrations,” he says. He still favors the same kind of steel-nibbed pens dipped into an inkpot that he used then.<br />Artistically, Mr. Steadman says that one of his most enduring influences is the Surrealist Marcel Duchamp. “It was his thinking out of context that interested me,” he says. “What I liked was Duchamp’s rather bland but comic sensibility, like taking a stool and attaching a bicycle wheel to the top of it.” In “A Life in Ink,” he attributes a different kind of influence to the headmaster of the school that he attended while growing up in Wales, “a hideous monster of a man that carried a cane” and left Mr. Steadman with an abiding mistrust of authority figures.<br />The young artist sold his first cartoon to the Manchester Evening Chronicle in 1956 and was soon being published in British humor magazines such as Punch and Private Eye. In 1969, the first book collection of his work, “Still Life with Raspberry,” launched his career in the U.S. He first collaborated with Thompson in 1970, when the two covered the Kentucky Derby for a short-lived magazine, Scanlan’s Monthly.</td>
