      <td>MOSCOW—Russia said it would expel diplomats from Sweden, Poland and Germany for taking part in what authorities say were unlawful rallies in support of jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny last month.<br />The ambassador of Sweden, Poland’s chargé d’affaires and a diplomat from the Germany Embassy in Moscow were summoned to Russia’s Foreign Ministry on Friday where they were served with a complaint in connection with “the recorded participation” of diplomatic employees “in illegal actions” on Jan. 23, a ministry statement said.<br />The Foreign Ministry said diplomatic employees from Sweden and Poland in St. Petersburg and of the German Embassy in Moscow violated diplomatic protocol by participating in the protests. “Such actions on their part are unacceptable and don’t correspond to their diplomatic status,” the statement said. The diplomats who took part in the action have been declared “persona non grata” and were ordered to leave Russia in the near future, the statement said.<br />The move raises the stakes for the European Union’s support of Mr. Navalny, who has been increasingly portrayed in state television and by pro-Kremlin authorities as an agent of the West. Mr. Navalny was evacuated to Germany where he spent five months recovering after he was poisoned in the Russian region of Siberia last year.<br />A German military laboratory, as well as labs in France and Sweden said they found Novichok in his system, a military grade nerve agent accessible only to those in Russia’s military and intelligence circles.</td>

      <td>An outsize Moses dominates the scene in Michelangelo’s Tomb of Pope Julius II.</td>
      <td>The bus dumped us in the sweltering Roman piazza before the church of San Pietro in Vincoli. Our destination: the famous statue of Moses. One befuddled visitor asked, “Is this the tomb of Moses?” From inside our earbuds, our unflappable tour guide intoned: “Ecco, the Tomb of Pope Julius II by Michelangelo Buonarroti, painter of the Sistine Ceiling.” Like twittering birds, our flock fluttered around taking pictures, many selfies.<br />Yet what we gazed upon is a far cry from the three-story ziggurat festooned with 40 marble statues that Michelangelo planned to carve himself and imagined as an eighth wonder of the world. The tomb, commissioned by Julius in 1505 for St. Peter’s Basilica and scarcely begun by the time of the pope’s death in 1513, proved to be Michelangelo’s 40-year albatross.<br />It was not completed until 1545, and then only after more than six contracts had been negotiated and innumerable design changes implemented, resulting in a smaller tomb, one set against a wall rather than freestanding. The figure of Moses, now the centerpiece, was originally intended as one of four prophets at the corners of the second story. A dozen years later, Michelangelo’s authorized biographer, Ascanio Condivi, would call the tomb “a tragedy.”<br />Yet the elapsed time also permitted the artist to mature and create a work that stands as a hinge point between the two Michelangelos, the youthful artist who astonished the world creating artistic marvels and the septuagenarian who yearned to be united in Christ.<br />The tomb is a two-story structure raised on a low plinth of undecorated marble, thus elevating and psychologically aggrandizing Moses. The richly decorated lower story with statues of Rachel and Leah acts as frame and foil for the prophet, while offering a dramatic contrast to the unexpectedly tall, and comparatively undecorated, upper story. There, Michelangelo created a bold and innovative architectural language that influenced such later designers as Gian Lorenzo Bernini.</td>

      <td>Election at Alabama warehouse set to be completed by late March</td>
      <td>Federal labor authorities rejected  Amazon.com Inc.’s  request to delay a union election at one of its warehouses in Alabama, clearing the way for thousands of workers to begin casting their votes this month.<br />The National Labor Relations Board denied Amazon’s request Friday, saying the company didn’t raise any substantial issues warranting review of the election. The online shopping giant asked the board in late January to postpone the union vote scheduled to begin Monday at its facility in Bessemer, Ala. Amazon also asked authorities to reconsider allowing mail-in voting due to the pandemic. The workers have until late March to return their ballots in an election that could reshape Amazon’s relationship with its hourly employees.<br />An Amazon spokeswoman said the company was disappointed by the board’s decision. Amazon “proposed a safe on-site election process validated by Covid-19 experts that would have empowered our associates to vote on their way to, during and from their already scheduled shifts,” she said.<br />“It’s long past time that Amazon start respecting its own employees,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, or RWDSU, which would represent the employees if they vote to unionize. Amazon must allow its workers “to cast their votes without intimidation and interference,” he said.<br />The union, which has become a frequent Amazon antagonist in recent years, has sought to garner support by rallying employees through family members and union members who work in other industries. Workers who want to unionize said doing so would let them bargain collectively over safety standards, training, breaks, pay and other workplace matters.</td>

      <td>WHAT IS IT with dog beds? Must they be those slobber-stained blobs that muck up an otherwise thoughtfully decorated interior? Luckily, a few designers, including Ellen Van Dusen, have pondered this as well. “Every bed was a shade of beige, and very utilitarian,” said the textile designer and founder of Brooklyn’s Dusen Dusen Home. “I didn’t get it—if you have all this nice furniture, why would you have this ugly pillow in the middle of the room?” Ms. Van Dusen has gone on to create color-blocked beds in vibrant shades, but pet lovers with more demure taste have stylish options, too—from flaxen chaise longues to rattan baskets that are plushed-out with fluffy cushions.<br />For safety’s sake, Gail Miller Bisher, the Fox Sports analyst for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, offered these tips: Avoid elevated beds for long-backed breeds like corgis or dachshunds, and steer clear of rippable fabrics if you have a teething puppy. Our picks reflect a universal truth: Cute is a mutable concept.<br />This roost brings you one dog bed closer to that dream of a Victorian-style, glass-enclosed room. Sue Jones, creative director of Oka, the brand behind it, underlines its practicality: “It’s hard-wearing and sturdy, and light enough to lift and move around.” In widths from 26 to 42 inches (shown), it can be cozied up with a blanket or cushion.<br />Ideal for: A glossy Irish setter.

Though the bed is otherwise unadorned, Düsseldorf interior architect Uta Cossman sneaked a tiny-arch flourish into its bent-plywood base.

Now, Democrats will turn to ironing out the details of the package over several weeks, including deciding who will be eligible for $1,400 direct payments and whether or not to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.<br />During the meeting at the White House, House committee leaders presented on various elements of the bill. Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the group discussed who should receive the $1,400 direct payments in Mr. Biden’s plan. Mr. Biden has indicated he is open to more narrowly targeting the checks.<br />The latest employment report showed the labor market remained weak, with the U.S. economy adding 49,000 jobs in January after payrolls fell steeply in December. Mr. Biden said he hoped for backing from some Republicans on the aid bill, but again indicated Democrats would move ahead without bipartisan support.<br />“There are some really fine people who want to get something done. But they’re just not willing to go as far as I think we have to go.”</td>

The film is about a precocious girl left as an infant at an orphanage by a witch, and grows up there until, year later, she is distressed to learn that she’s been adopted.

      <td>SoftBank Group Corp. -backed Greensill Capital, a specialty finance startup that helps companies manage cash, has delayed by several months plans to raise fresh money from outside investors, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Greensill had previously hoped to secure the investment by early January. But the company is unlikely to complete the funding round until late March at the earliest, some of the people said. One of these people said the delay is because Greensill has increased the amount it wants to raise to $1 billion from $500 million.<br />The fundraising delay comes at a challenging time for the company, which competes with banks to supply short-term capital to companies. The firm had anticipated extending $173 billion in financing last year, according to a presentation viewed by The Wall Street Journal, but ultimately provided $143 billion, flat from the year before.<br />Greensill has also run into issues doing business with other SoftBank-related companies. In December, Greensill forgave $435 million in financing to construction startup Katerra, in exchange for a roughly 5% stake in the company, Katerra’s chief executive told The Wall Street Journal.<br />Both companies are held in SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund. It isn’t clear how much the 5% stake in Katerra is worth. At the same time, SoftBank injected $200 million into Katerra to help it avoid bankruptcy. Katerra seeks to construct buildings more cheaply by cutting out middlemen and using factory assembly.</td>

His commentary could also create a legal problem for the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., which employed him and had a duty to supervise him.<br />Mr. Gill worked as a “financial-wellness education director” but was a registered broker, according to BrokerCheck, a website of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra. He didn’t advise specific clients on investments or insurance, but he wasn’t exempt from regulations that tightly regulate brokers’ conduct, securities lawyers said.<br />Mr. Gill has posted dozens of videos or livestreams over the past six months, most of them related to his view that GameStop shares were undervalued and would rise as others took notice. Some videos examined the company’s past performance and forecast aspects of its future outlook.<br />Brokerage firms are required to closely supervise their brokers’ communications on social media if those posts have anything to do with their work.

      <td>An auction of items from the KGB Espionage Museum reveals the ingenuity and oppression of the Soviet secret police.</td>
      <td>Julien’s Auctions, in Culver City, Calif., bills itself as the Auction House to the Stars and specializes in celebrity items like Kurt Cobain’s guitar, which sold for $6 million last summer. But on Feb. 13, Julien’s will be auctioning some very different kinds of memorabilia. The items on sale in “The Cold War Relics Auction,” in person and online, include  a half-ton bust of Lenin and miniature cameras hidden in everything from belts to Marlboro cigarette packs.<br />These items come from the collection of the KGB Espionage Museum, which opened in Manhattan in early 2019. At the time, the museum claimed to have the world’s largest collection of objects associated with the Soviet secret police agency—more than 3,500, many from the personal collection of the museum’s founder, Lithuania-born Julius Urbaitis. The museum closed last March because of the pandemic and then shut down for good in October.<br />The USSR’s secret police agency was known by a series of names before it became the KGB in 1954—an acronym for its Russian name, Committee for State Security. From the beginning, it was adept at bugging things: Microphones went into wristwatches, wallets, ashtrays, belts, dinner plates and ballpoint pens, all of which are represented in the auction. The KGB even hid a side-facing camera inside a front-facing one, so the photographer could aim at one person while secretly photographing another.<br />Also on sale is a replica of the Great Seal of the U.S., given by a Soviet boy-scout organization to the American ambassador to Moscow in 1946 in gratitude for wartime aid. The gift was bugged; the Americans proudly hung it in the ambassador’s study, and it transmitted for years. A needle drill used to create the small holes for surveillance devices is expected to fetch $1,000-$2,000.<br />The auction’s catalog explains that language was a daunting challenge for the KGB, since the countries behind the Iron Curtain used many languages and two alphabets, Roman and Cyrillic. One solution was the Fialka cipher machine, which roughly resembles a typewriter and was used to code and decode messages. A far cry from today’s digital encryption, the machine operated with rotors—discs with electrical contacts that worked to encode the message. The Fialka is expected to fetch $8,000 to $12,000.</td>

      <td>The increase would take place over a number of years, though the proposal faces resistance and its fate is uncertain</td>
      <td>A recent exchange between Republican senators and a leading proponent of raising the minimum wage highlighted a sometimes overlooked facet of the Democrats’ effort to boost the floor to $15 an hour—the increase would happen gradually, not all at once.<br />Here is a closer look at the proposal, which Democrats hope to include in a broader $1.9 trillion Covid-19 aid bill, and its chances of passage through a process called budget reconciliation.<br />In a vote intended to show Democrats’ divides on the issue, Republicans proposed a budget amendment that would prevent Congress from raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour during the pandemic. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), an outspoken proponent of raising the wage, countered that the proposal would raise the wage over several years, not all at once, so he had no problem with the Republican amendment. As a result, it passed by unanimous voice vote.<br />“I will do everything that I can to make sure a $15-an-hour minimum wage is included in this reconciliation bill, but there appears to be some misunderstanding,” said Mr. Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats. “It was never my intention to raise the minimum wage immediately and during the pandemic.”<br />President Biden has called for a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, up from $7.25 currently, a move that would require action by Congress. But the wage wouldn’t jump the full amount immediately.</td>

The move will diminish Mrs. Greene’s ability to shape legislation and work with other lawmakers, sidelining her just weeks into her first term in office.<br />Still, Mrs. Greene said that she felt freed by the decision because Democrats held the power in Washington.<br />“If I was on a committee, I’d be wasting my time because my conservative values wouldn’t be heard and neither would my district’s,” she said.</td>

      <td>How a Census Bureau error led Democrats to assume they were on the right side of inexorable demographic trends.</td>
      <td>Remember the “coalition of the ascendant”? National Journal’s Ronald Brownstein invented the phrase in 2008 to describe the “growing elements of American society” that had elected Barack Obama and given Democrats commanding majorities in both congressional houses: “young people, Hispanics and other minorities, and white upper-middle-class professionals.”<br />Republican successes in 2010, 2014 and 2016 called the coalition’s durability into question. But the 2020 election—Joe Biden’s victory notwithstanding—may provide the greatest reason to doubt it. Compared with 2016, President Trump and congressional Republicans improved their standing significantly among Hispanic voters and made smaller strides among other groups, such as Asian-Americans, blacks and Muslims.<br />“The majority minority narrative is wrong,” says sociologist Richard Alba, referring to the idea that nonwhite Americans will outnumber whites by 2050 or so. In his recent book, “The Great Demographic Illusion,” Mr. Alba, 78, shows that many “nonwhites” are assimilating into an American mainstream, much as white ethnic groups did before them. Government statistics have failed to account for this complex reality, partly for political reasons, and in doing so they’ve encouraged sloppy thinking about the country’s future.<br />“The surge in mixing across ethno-racial lines is one of the most important and unheralded developments of our time,” says Mr. Alba, a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He rattles off facts and figures: Today, more than 10% of U.S.-born babies have one parent who is nonwhite or Hispanic and one who is white and not Hispanic. That proportion is larger than the number of babies born to two Asian parents and not far behind the number of babies born to two black parents. “We’re entering a new era of mixed backgrounds,” Mr. Alba says.<br />It reminds him of the postwar era, when the members of white ethnic groups began to make major socioeconomic gains as well as to intermarry. Mr. Alba, who grew up in the Parkchester neighborhood of the Bronx, is himself a product of this amalgamation: His father was Sicilian, and his mother was Irish. As for his politics, Mr. Alba describes himself as “a liberal with centrist leanings.” He voted for Mr. Biden and favors higher taxes and “more redistribution.”</td>

      <td>After ‘The Queen’s Gambit,’ TV could bet on a show about parcheesi—or dominoes.</td>
      <td>The enormously popular Netflix  series “The Queen’s Gambit” took 37 years to make it to the screen because Hollywood did not think the public would have much interest in a 1950s-era Kentucky orphan who grows up to be the world’s greatest chess player. It wasn’t so much the orphaned girl with the substance abuse problem that was the obstacle. It was chess. Too technical. Too nerdy. Too boring.<br />But by the time the pandemic arrived, the public was interested in watching—and playing—just about anything. So “The Queen’s Gambit” became one of the most popular Netflix series ever and spawned a revival of interest in the game, with chess sets flying off shelves around the world and new converts playing chess online at all hours. The verdict is still out on whether this is a good thing.<br />We don’t know if there will be a second season for the show, but since nothing succeeds like success, chess-themed spinoffs, sequels, prequels or out-and-out rip-offs are surely on the drawing board. A dirt-poor Las Vegas kid becomes a grandmistress and opens her own upscale consignment store, in “Pawn Shoppe.” Or perhaps a burger joint in the limited series “White Girl’s Castle.” Other possibilities? “The Rook’s Riposte.” “Knight of the Living Dead.” “Queen of the Hill.” “What Ever Happened to Joey’s Bishop?”<br />There is, however, no reason that future projects should be limited to chess. I, for one, would love to see a series about a down-at-the-heels pizza delivery man doing nothing with his life until he suddenly discovers a fascinating game of the same name as his employer. After a series of heart-rending missteps and disappointments, the young man triumphs in the game’s world championships, held in New York’s Little Italy. Proposed title? “The Domino’s Effect.”<br />A similar message about rising from humble beginnings and conquering adversity would be the theme of a series about a cash-strapped supermarket cashier who beats all comers in “Checkers for the Checker.” Which might spawn a British version called “The Draughts Dodger.” More possibilities wait in the wings: A lovelorn farmer’s wife falls in love with a charming, peripatetic card player in “The Bridge Players of Madison County.”</td>

You might not think you’re ready for this but you’re just going to have to jump in and figure it out as you go.’ ”<br />She studied video tutorials on LinkedIn Learning about the ins and outs of what’s now often called “on-demand work” and booked her first freelance assignment in September. Since then, she has been offering multimedia-design services, such as video editing, and digital marketing on a contract basis. Though Ms. Bennett says the hustle required to freelance is challenging, she hopes to eventually make a career as an independent worker.<br />Ms. Bennett is one of thousands of people—from millennials to senior executives—who have started working for themselves in the pandemic, whether as high-skilled gig workers in fields like computer engineering, solo entrepreneurs launching one-person firms, or freelance workers offering specific services like data analytics or digital marketing.<br />Some are part of an undeclared economy—often one-person, cash operations not captured in the data. However, one measure points to a sharp rise in those turning to self-employment. Some who start a business of their own apply for tax identification numbers, and Census Bureau data show that applications by businesses not expected to have employees rose 33% in the fourth quarter of 2020 from a year earlier. In July though September, they jumped 77% from the previous three months—the largest quarter-to-quarter jump in 16 years of record-keeping.</td>

If successful, it would thrust the iPhone maker into the car business after several years of secretive work in which its engineers plotted to upend the 100-plus-year-old automotive industry.<br />The likelihood of a final agreement was thrown into question when Kia’s parent company,  Hyundai Motor Group ,  said last month, then sought to play down, that it was in negotiations with Apple to cooperate on an electric driverless car. Apple has never confirmed those talks, and its dalliances with other auto makers in the past have fizzled.<br />Hyundai has talked to Apple about investing more than $3 billion in a deal that would see its subsidiary Kia begin building cars under the tech company’s brand as soon as 2024, a person familiar with the matter said. Under such an agreement, up to 100,000 vehicles could be assembled in the first year in Georgia, where Kia has a factory, the person said. South Korean newspaper Dong-A Ilbo earlier reported the potential deal’s scope.<br />As reports of a deal have filled the Korean media, Hyundai and Kia shares have soared. Recently, Hyundai-Kia officials have been reaching out to potential partners in preparation for a deal going through. “We are hearing encouraging things,” said a person briefed on the matter in Georgia.</td>

      <td>Declines in retail and restaurant employment last month show a labor market still tightly in Covid-19’s grip</td>
      <td>The job market still hasn’t found its footing.<br />The Labor Department on Friday reported that the economy added a seasonally adjusted 49,000 jobs last month, which was in line with what economists expected, but it also revised the December and November figures down by a combined 159,000 jobs. The unemployment rate, which is based on a separate survey from the jobs figures, slipped to 6.3% from December’s 6.7%. But that came about in part because fewer people were looking for work and weren’t counted in the labor force as a result.<br />Two worrisome things about Friday’s report were that it showed that retailers shed a seasonally adjusted 37,800 jobs in January, and that restaurant and bar employment fell by 19,400 jobs.<br />Retail employment always falls in January from December, of course, as people hired on temporarily for the holiday shopping season are let go. But the Labor Department’s adjustments for seasonal swings should account for that effect. Moreover, because retailers hired fewer people during this past holiday season as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, many economists thought that the drop in retail employment would be smaller than the seasonal factors anticipated, so that the seasonally adjusted figure would actually rise.<br />Restaurant and bar employment fell even though measures such as the University of Oxford’s policy-stringency index suggest that, on balance, they didn’t face any greater restrictions on doing business in January than in December. That might be an indication that consumer caution, due to the surge in Covid cases that has only lately begun to subside, is taking a toll on business.</td>

      <td>The pediatrician and infectious-disease specialist is enthusiastic about the ‘phenomenal effectiveness’ of the shots that can prevent Covid-19</td>
      <td>Paul Offit was 5 when a clubfoot operation landed him in a Baltimore hospital ward for “crippled children” for six weeks in 1956. The atmosphere was “Dickensian,” he recalls: Some patients were in iron lungs, others were in traction, and most were hobbled by polio, a debilitating disease with a new but not yet widely available vaccine. His bed faced a window that overlooked the hospital’s front door, and he spent hours every day hoping for a visit from someone he loved. But a complicated pregnancy kept his mother away, and his father was banned after he tried to sneak in. The hospital allowed visitors only one hour a week, so the ward’s other children seemed similarly forlorn and helpless.<br />“It absolutely scarred me,” Dr. Offit, 69, says over the phone from his home in Avalon, N.J. The experience left him with an appreciation of the vulnerability of children and a deep desire to protect them. This, he says, is why he became a pediatrician, has written so many books about the medical needs of children and is such an outspoken advocate of the science and value of vaccinations. “I think the scars of our youth become the passions of our adulthood,” he says. “On some level, we always treat ourselves.”<br />An infectious-disease specialist, Dr. Offit is the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, a professor in pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committee on vaccines. As a virology expert who co-invented a vaccine himself—his rotavirus vaccine saves up to 2,000 lives a day around the world—Dr. Offit has been helping the FDA to review the data for the latest coronavirus vaccines. He is enthusiastic about their “phenomenal effectiveness.”<br />The fact that researchers could prove the safety and efficacy of several vaccines within a year of sequencing the virus that causes Covid-19 has been a “scientific tour de force,” says Dr. Offit. The rollout, however, has been far from smooth, in part because the U.S. simply had “no plan” at the federal level for distributing the vaccine—an oversight that he attributes to the “denialism and magical thinking” of the Trump administration. Troublingly, nearly four in 10 Americans say they don’t plan to get vaccinated, according to a November survey by the Pew Research Center.<br />Some of this hesitation is understandable, says Dr. Offit. Not only was the vaccine developed in record time, but some of the language surrounding it—“Operation Warp Speed,” etc.—has been “a little frightening,” he concedes. But he notes that the clinical-trial data are “enormously reassuring,” and there is scant evidence of serious side effects in the millions who have already been vaccinated world-wide.</td>

      <td>A notorious defender of slavery was led to think seriously about how to protect minority rights.</td>
      <td>Gone are the days when someone could win a debate by claiming to be on the side of the Great Emancipator, Abraham Lincoln. The new rules for winning require accusing one’s opponent of being on the side of the Great Nullifier, John C. Calhoun, best remembered for his defense of slavery and his argument for the right of states to veto federal laws.<br />When the New York Times published “The 1619 Project” on the 400th anniversary of the first African slaves landing in Virginia, one of its essays labeled modern Republicans as Calhoun’s ideological successors. Not to be outdone, a report last month from the 1776 Commission, which Donald Trump formed as president partly in response to “The 1619 Project,” argued that Calhoun’s true heirs are the adherents of identity politics—that is, today’s Democrats.<br />Lost in such an exchange is the sort of serious analysis that Robert Elder, a history professor at Baylor University, provides in “Calhoun: American Heretic,” a timely and thought-provoking biography of the South Carolina statesman whose doctrines and debates set the stage for the Civil War. In the course of his chronicle, Mr. Elder traces how Calhoun’s thinking continues to influence American society today and shows how academic scholarship has moved ever closer to accepting Calhoun’s once shocking ideas about the role of slavery in American history.<br />Even many fellow Southerners recoiled upon first hearing Calhoun’s claim that slavery had created the surest conditions for equality among whites; slavery, he said, had produced an “unvarying level among them”—or, more precisely, above blacks forced to toil. “I fearlessly assert that the existing relation between the two races in the South . . . forms the most solid and durable foundation on which to rear free and stable political institutions,” Calhoun said in an 1837 Senate speech holding up slavery as a “positive good.”<br />A stunned Virginia senator responded that the first three slaveholding presidents—George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison—didn’t view slavery as the bedrock of the republic they had created. But, as Mr. Elder concedes, the argument is gaining ground. Indeed, it is now widely contended—not least among historians—that slavery “had to a significant degree underwritten the equality, prosperity, and progress of white Americans.”</td>

I began reading him in my 20s, some 40 years ago, and have turned to him regularly, if in spurts, ever since. In a recent tallying-up I discovered I’d read 18 of his novels, or roughly one every two years. But there are 47 novels in all, leaving me with nearly 30 to go—some 60 years of Trollope to unfold. I find the image heartening: myself as an advanced centenarian, still with a few unread novels before me.<br />Trollope occupies a peculiar—a distorted—place in the American imagination. Fate has conspired, with the able assistance of the BBC, to portray him as a creator of landscapes so English that, under his spell, the rest of the planet falls under a distant haze. Trollope once remarked, “Visitors to England who have not sojourned at a country-house, whether it be the squire’s, parson’s, or farmer’s, have not seen the most English phase of the country.” Those country houses loom large in the BBC’s fetching Trollope adaptations, emerging in the 1970s with the vast 26-episode “The Pallisers,” continuing in the ’80s with the seven-episode “Barchester Chronicles” and extending into our century with “He Knew He Was Right” and “The Way We Live Now.”<br />Readers who first meet Trollope via television may be surprised to discover that in his time he was a footloose cosmopolite. Most of his early wanderings were business travel. Trollope worked for 33 years as a civil servant in the British post-office system, 20 of these years in Ireland, where the ghost of his disastrous childhood (“I was ill-dressed and dirty” and “despised by all my companions”) was successfully laid to rest. (“But from the day on which I set my foot in Ireland all these evils went away from me.”) He was later dispatched on post-office business to Egypt and Malta and Cuba. Still later, as a full-time author, he kept journeying abroad and wound up claiming five different continents as backdrops for his books: Europe, North America, Africa, Asia and Oceania. It would be hard to name another 19th-century European novelist whose work was so far-flung.<br />Trollope’s six Palliser novels are often regarded as the crowning summit of his ranging, mountainous output. They make up a loosely bound set. Conceived singly rather than collectively, they were published over 16 years, in the midst of other projects. What chiefly unifies them are their overlapping characters and their ongoing, clamorous obsession with parliamentary politics, especially the seesawing battle between Conservatives and Trollope’s own beloved Liberals. Pursuing a lifelong dream (“to sit in the British Parliament should be the highest object of ambition to every educated Englishman”), Trollope once stood unsuccessfully for the House of Commons, and the Palliser sextet might be viewed as a benevolent revenge upon an unobliging electorate.<br />The final—and to my eyes the finest—volume in the series, “The Duke’s Children,” has a curious publication history. In 1878, when he submitted the novel, Trollope was in a slough, commercially and critically, and his publisher convinced him to excise 65,000 words from the outsized manuscript. For more than a century, this was the “Duke’s Children” known to the world. But in 2015, on the occasion of Trollope’s bicentennial, the Folio Society published a deluxe limited edition of the restored text in England, and Everyman offered a hardcover in the States. The book, edited by the American scholar Steven Amarnick, now appears in paperback, as an Oxford World’s Classic (678 pages, $16.95). At long last, all the children of “The Duke’s Children” are fully born.</td>

      <td>A visit with four masters of short fiction is a lesson in artistry and vision.</td>
      <td>In recent decades, too many academic literary critics have used classic works of literature as mere springboards for social or political theories. When they do turn their attention to a work, they often treat it as a “text,” that is, as words on the page through which not the author but “language” speaks. George Saunders deems his delightful readings of seven stories by Chekhov, Gogol, Turgenev and Tolstoy non-academic, and they are all the better for that.<br />Mr. Saunders, himself a distinguished author of short stories, knows that the work is not the text but the experience the text is designed to create for the attentive reader. He guides us through each story to show what such attention can reveal.<br />To be certain that the reading experience is fresh when we consider his analyses, Mr. Saunders includes each story in full in an adequate, if not always the best, translation. He begins by giving us Chekhov’s “In the Cart” one page at a time, with his own commentaries following each page, so we can attend to how our feelings develop as we read—to the story not just as a remembered whole but as an unfolding event. How did Chekhov’s choice of words make us feel? What does an apparently superfluous description of nature accomplish, and why is it there? What were we anticipating at each point? Chekhov’s stories and plays often turn on a desired event that could have but did not happen—an expected marriage proposal never made, a neglected opportunity for kindness, a hoped-for meeting that could have eased unbearable loneliness. And so Mr. Saunders’s approach, which reminds us of that which we anticipated, works especially well. To understand short stories, we do not need some all-encompassing theory, he explains, but “moment-to-moment responsiveness.” To show why a given event or description is meaningful, Mr. Saunders sometimes rewrites a passage without it. The first half of Turgenev’s brilliant story “The Singers,” for instance, seems irrelevant to the plot about a singing competition, but Mr. Saunders retells the story without its beginning. The reader then grasps how the experience would be different, and understands why the author wrote the story he did.<br />At his best, Mr. Saunders teases out easily overlooked moments of authorial genius. The lonely schoolmistress of Chekhov’s “In the Cart” is distracting herself with thoughts about her school when, without preparation, she thinks how handsome the man who just passed by is. That thought, which intimates a romance she will never have, had evidently been occupying the periphery of her attention, even when she was concentrating on something else. “That self-interruption is a beautiful thing,” Mr. Saunders shrewdly observes. “It says: the mind can be two places at once. . . He’s not for her, she knows it . . . and yet her mind keeps being lured back to him.”<br />Readers have marveled at Tolstoy’s ability to make religious conversion psychologically plausible. Mr. Saunders notices one way Tolstoy does it. The hero of “Master and Man” does not first understand the divine truth and then act on it. Rather, he continues to act as he always has, but in circumstances that make formerly selfish behavior generous. With the same energy, the same words to himself, as he used in striking business deals, he now gives his life to save his freezing servant when they are both caught in a terrible snowstorm. He then, and only then—after experiencing surprising spiritual joy—realizes the truth and chooses to act on it deliberately.</td>

      <td>With interest rates so low, some advisers think investors have too much to lose by focusing solely on bond index funds</td>
      <td>Baby boomers investing for retirement back in the ’80s, ’90s and ’00s rarely had to worry about the bonds in their nest eggs.<br />Bonds back then mainly served as risk-reducing ballast for when stocks tanked. And they weren’t that much of a sacrifice because they often paid healthy interest yields of 5% or more.<br />But now, when boomers are supposed to have increased bond weightings in their portfolios—40% or more of a nest egg, according to the conventional wisdom—rates have fallen to the floor. Interest yields on a bond index fund are as low as 1.1%. As a result, retirees and other index bond investors are left staring at tiny interest coupons and a greater risk of rising rates, and thus of lost principal.<br />“With interest rates near their historic lows, so close to zero, there’s generally only one direction they can go,” says Steve Kane, a manager of the $90 billion  fund (MWTRX).<br />In response, investors might want to consider adding to their fixed-income portfolios some bond funds that can offer higher yields than U.S. bond index funds and offer varying degrees of protection from the risk of rising rates. At the moment, commonly used bond-market calculations suggest that for every percentage-point rise in rates, a U.S. bond index fund will lose about 6% in price, wiping out years of interest receipts.</td>

      <td>Hong Kong has become a flashpoint in what some see as an emerging cold war between the U.S. and China. Exhibit A is Beijing’s decision to bypass Hong Kong’s legislature and impose new national-security legislation on the city on July 1 to stamp out a yearlong protest movement.<br />Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed government moved quickly to make use of those powers to pacify the city, arresting protesters, ejecting four pro-democracy lawmakers from the city’s legislature and rounding up opposition figures. Recently, 53 were arrested in a series of dawn raids on Jan. 6 over allegations of plotting to subvert the city’s government, taking the total of security law arrests to around 100 as of early February.<br />The U.S. has taken steps to punish Beijing by restricting visas for Chinese officials and declaring that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to merit special treatment on trade in goods such as defense technologies. It also imposed sanctions on some Chinese officials and Hong Kong governing figures including Chief Executive Carrie Lam. Here’s how we got to this point.<br />Around 1,000 police officers arrested 53 pro-democracy figures in a high-profile operation that involved searching 72 locations across the city on Jan. 6. It was the biggest swoop since the law was imposed.<br />The allegations center on unofficial primaries held by opposition groups in July for the public to choose the most popular candidates for legislative elections planned for September. More than 600,000 people voted. The pro-democracy camp sought to win more than half of the 70 seats in the city’s legislature and said it would use a majority to block government policy. Many candidates were subsequently disqualified, and officials then postponed the poll for a year, citing the coronavirus situation.</td>

      <td>No single trick delivers the crisp skin and juicy meat we covet. An experienced roaster shares her own, holistic approach, and a recipe so simple and reliable you’ll want to use it weekly.</td>
      <td>I FIELD more questions than you might imagine on the best way to roast a chicken. It comes up all the time among friends who know I used to cook at Zuni Café in San Francisco, legendary for its version.<br />The secret to the Zuni chicken is that there really isn’t one. The recipe relies on no special bells or whistles. You don’t need to apply a hair dryer to ensure a crispy skin, as a viral recipe from 2018 recommended. It’s more about understanding a few fundamentals than adhering to any one trick or recipe.<br />Roasting a whole chicken has always been a staple of the weekly cooking in my household, mostly because it’s economical, yielding returns throughout the week. The legs often get eaten first, accompanied by bitter greens or mushrooms cooked in the chicken fat. Breast meat frequently gets stewed down in beer or stock as a filling for tacos, topped off with skin crisped into chicharrón. The carcass becomes stock, which I like to use in a comforting rice porridge.<br />My husband and I have maintained our weekly roast-chicken ritual during the pandemic, and we’ve experimented, too—sometimes unintentionally. There were times we simply forgot what was on the evening’s menu or had a hunger for something else, which meant we left the salted chicken uncovered in the refrigerator, dry brining, up to 3 days. The result: a shatteringly crisp skin once we got around to roasting. Other times, a pantry sweep turned up different spices—sumac, say, or cayenne—to bolster the dry brine.<br />In my Zuni days, I learned a lot from the restaurant’s massive wood-fired oven. It has two chambers. “The rear gap allows flame to travel from the bottom chamber into the upper,” Zuni’s current chef de cuisine, Nate Norris, confirmed. This creates hot spots, so a cook must move the chicken around as it roasts. While there’s really no way to replicate that oven at home, you can get close enough by cooking at a high temperature and cranking it up even higher in the final stage.</td>

      <td>Chic, virtually indestructible, much more practical than you’d think—vintage wool rugs are interior designers’ go-to bathroom rugs</td>
      <td>“BATHROOMS ARE inherently cold spaces,” said Meg McSherry, a designer in Newton, Mass. “We’re always focused on ways to add warmth.” One seemingly counterintuitive way to cozy up a loo stylishly? Vintage wool rugs, say many design pros, including Ms. McSherry. While cotton is the default choice, wool is “naturally strong, soft underfoot and not stubborn with stain removal,” she said.<br />A vintage Persian rug is no more likely to grow moldy than many other natural materials. Cotton, for example, mildews at lower humidity than wool, according to the Smithsonian’s Museum Conservation Institute. But if you can’t get your mind around sopping a wool rug post-bath, top it with a small cotton mat you hang over the tub or towel rod to dry between ablutions. If you want additional cushiness, place your wool rug atop a nonslip, recycled felt pad, said Chicago designer Elizabeth Stamos.<br />Another perk of opting for a weathered carpet? “Vintage rugs are perfectly imperfect,” Ms. McSherry said. “They will [already] have some wear and tear, so any makeup spills will not be super noticeable.” Going vintage also offers the same satisfaction as choosing to reuse anything: less land-fill fodder. “And it feels less precious than buying new, meaning you probably won’t feel bad about getting it wet,” said Kerra Michele Huerta, a designer in Washington, D.C.<br />You’ll need to vacuum a vintage rug weekly at least. A study out of Ohio State University last year found that a dusty rug will hold more moisture than a clean one. Vacuum the piece on a low-power setting if your machine has one. “Clean up spills immediately, blotting the stain and using lukewarm water with mild detergent,” advised Salt Lake City designer Sarah Gibson, who also writes a blog called Room for Tuesday, on which she has advocated for wool rugs in the bathroom. “Wool is naturally a moisture-wicking material,” said Ms. Gibson, who grew up raising sheep on a farm and admits to being a wool zealot. You can also give your rug a do-it-yourself deep clean, hand washing and drying it flat, as you would a wool sweater.<br />Vintage rugs also offer more versatility than a typical rug designed for a bathroom. You most likely wouldn’t move a chenille number to your bedroom or entryway, but a vintage rug travels well. They’re also great-looking and one-of-a-kind, and they can be found at auction for a song. A 2-foot-by-3-foot handwoven Turkish Village Kilim rug recently sold on Everything But the House for $27.</td>

      <td>Bill Gates is doubling down on private-jet travel, as the niche industry recovers more quickly amid the coronavirus pandemic than the wider commercial aviation market.<br />The billionaire’s Cascade Investment LLC agreed Friday to team up with  Blackstone Group Inc.  and private-equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners in a $4.7 billion deal for  Signature Aviation  PLC. The deal would boost Cascade’s stake in the world’s largest operator of private-jet bases to 30%, from a previous 19%.<br />Commercial flying in much of the world has fallen sharply amid travel restrictions, quarantine rules and steep reductions in flights operated by cash-strapped airlines. Private-jet travel has bounced back quicker. For individuals and companies who can afford it, a private jet offers a way to limit close-quarters exposure to other passengers, as well as providing service to destinations that have been abandoned by airlines.<br />U.K.-based Signature Aviation said in November that demand had stabilized at 80% of 2019 levels. In comparison, global commercial airlines were operating at around one-third of pre-pandemic capacity then.<br />The move comes after more than a year of jostling between the three firms, drawn by the relatively quick recovery in demand for private jets. Blackstone and GIP had previously been engaged in a bidding war for the company.</td>

      <td>Researchers warn that the variant, now detected in the U.S., may spread faster and could reduce the efficacy of vaccines</td>
      <td>A more contagious strain of the coronavirus, first discovered in South Africa, has now been detected in the U.S. The variant has raised concerns over how it will respond to Covid-19 vaccines and whether people who already had the disease could get it again from the new strain.<br />It is normal for viruses to mutate, and most mutations observed so far in the coronavirus sweeping the globe have made little difference to how it functions. The South African variant, known as B. 1.351 or 501.V2, has worried scientists because of its unusually large number of mutations, especially in the spike protein, which the virus uses to attach to and infect human cells. The spike protein is also the part of the virus targeted by Covid-19 vaccines and antibody treatments.<br />The discovery and spread of the variant in South Africa coincided with a powerful surge in infections in the country. South African researchers say they believe that the new variant is around 50% more contagious, based on the much faster rate of Covid-19 transmission since its emergence and biological studies of changes to the structure of the virus, which appear to make it easier for it to attach to and infect human cells. The new strain quickly crowded out other versions of the virus circulating in the country. Still, they say human behavior also contributed to the rise in infections. The researchers say that the new variant doesn’t appear to lead to more severe cases of Covid-19.<br />Health authorities in South Carolina and Maryland have identified people who were infected with the South African variant. At least some of those people haven’t traveled abroad recently, suggesting that the variant is potentially circulating in the community. The variant has also been detected in people with no recent travel history in the Canada, Israel, and several countries in Europe and Africa.<br />The scientists who sequenced the South African variant’s genome say it has a mutation—known as N501—that it shares with a separate variant discovered in the U.K. Scientists say that mutation is likely responsible for making the variants more transmissible.</td>

Many sectors, though, lost jobs last month. The leisure and hospitality sector lost 61,000 jobs in January, following a steep decline of 536,000 in December. Retailers, health-care companies and warehouses cut jobs in January.<br />The fall in the unemployment rate in part reflected the Labor Department’s annual update to population estimates used to calculate the unemployment rate and other measures.

      <td>Pared-back collections of clothes and accessories are simplifying women’s lives and eliminating daily ‘what to wear?’ stress. Here, how to build your own.</td>
      <td>IF YOU’VE GOT a closet full of clothes and nothing to wear, consider the benefits of a capsule wardrobe. Worn in combos, these tightly edited, pragmatic assortments of clothes and accessories can create many fail-safe outfits. The strategy can liberate you from the oppression of wondering “What should I wear,” simplify life and free your mind to engage in more meaningful pursuits, such as rereading “To the Lighthouse” or taking that raku pottery workshop.<br />Factors from Covid-19’s confinement lifestyle to Marie-Kondo culture have all fed the popularity of capsule wardrobes over the past year. Aren’t we all on a quest for control? But the capsule wardrobe concept has been around for decades. The term even merits its own relatively concise Wikipedia page, which credits the invention to Susie Faux who, in the 1970s, founded a London boutique called Wardrobe. Donna Karan’s mid-80s version, Seven Easy Pieces, changed the game for “Working Girl”-era women. And women’s magazines have trafficked in variations on “Five Ways to Wear It” or “10 Wardrobe Staples” for years.<br />For some modern-day apostles, it’s about putting your closet on a fashion diet. You can approach this by adhering to a preferred color palette or eliminating all but go-to basics—but rules help. Back in 2010, Courtney Carver, a 51-year-old in Salt Lake City, Utah, created Project 333, a 3-month challenge that required her to refrain from shopping and whittle her wardrobe to 33 items (underwear, sleepwear and workout gear don’t count). The process was part of a life-simplifying journey that began when Ms. Carver was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Once a self-described “adder,” she used to shop weekly to boost her mood. “It was ‘If I get this thing, I’ll feel happier,” she said. “It was never about the item. It was escape.”<br />Lee Vosburgh, 33, a blogger who runs the website Style Bee, created the 10 x 10 Challenge in 2015 as an antidote to her own shopaholism. Her call-to-action: Restrict yourself to 10 items, and style them into 10 outfits over 10 days. For her part, Jennifer Alfano, 52, a former Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar editor who now runs TheFlairIndex.com, doesn’t adhere to any magic-number methodology. She advocates eliminating excess by making “a list of what you have, why you have it and why you should keep it.” Next, reduce your closet to “an ultimate packing list” to identify essentials.

Textbooks are being rewritten to be more patriotic to China, and some images likely to antagonize Beijing are being removed, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Education is identified in the security law as a key area where greater government oversight is needed—along with the media and the internet. State media ascribed considerable blame for 2019’s social unrest to the city’s liberal school system and teachers. Thousands of students were arrested during monthslong protests, while many more formed human chains and chanted protest slogans in school yards.<br />China’s push to bring up future generations as dutiful citizens, however, is stoking concern among many teachers, students and parents, some of whom say it undermines long-cherished  principles of critical thinking and uncensored debate. Opposition groups say the clampdown is part of Beijing’s broader effort to stifle dissent in the city that has seen dozens of democratic politicians arrested and street protests stamped out.</td>

      <td>TAMPA, Fla.—Tom Brady became the greatest quarterback of all-time by perfecting the way the position is played. He steps backward. He makes microscopic movements, seemingly with a sixth sense for pressure. Then he quickly unleashes the football.<br />Patrick Mahomes has become the greatest quarterback of the next generation by reinventing the precise art that Brady mastered. He throws on the run, goes off script and weaponizes the entire football field against the defense.<br />This Super Bowl between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs is a window into an evolution unfolding in the NFL. The most important position in football is transforming. And the two most transcendent players in the Super Bowl are at the beginning and end of it.<br />Tom Brady defined how to properly play quarterback. Mahomes revolutionized it. They’ve both won the Super Bowl because of that. On Sunday, they will play the same position on the same field in the same sport—and play it nothing like one another. They’re peers who aren’t peers.<br />“[Brady] probably is the standard by which young quarterbacks could judge themselves as far as a pocket passer is concerned,” said Tom House, who trains NFL quarterbacks including Brady. “Mahomes is the prototype of the new school quarterback, where they basically are runners who can pass—or passers who can run.”</td>

      <td>Connected fitness company scrambling to improve deliveries as recovery from pandemic may alter its value proposition</td>
      <td>Peloton Interactive ’s  high-quality problem is getting to be an expensive one.<br />The purveyor of connected spin bikes and treadmills reported predictably strong results for its fiscal second quarter on Thursday afternoon. Revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $1.06 billion, with connected fitness subscriptions surging 134% to about 1.7 million. And Peloton’s appeal doesn’t even fully rest on those willing to shell out top dollar for its gear: Paid digital subscriptions to the company’s vast offering of virtual workouts soared 472% to about 625,000.<br />But some of those metrics are rather backward looking. Because Peloton doesn’t recognize revenue on its gear until it is in customers’ hands, revenue and subscriptions tied to those products essentially reflect what the company was able to get to customers who were patient enough to wait out production constraints. They haven’t seemed to ease: Peloton’s website still shows eight to 10 weeks of wait time to fulfill orders, even as the company says it has significantly increased its manufacturing output.<br />This has tested the patience of customers, many of whom have taken to Facebook and other social outlets to complain about the delays. Peloton might be the most famous game in town, but there are other makers of connected bikes doing brisk business. Peloton also saw a sharp slowdown in the growth of customer deposits and deferred revenue during the December quarter, which could indicate slowing demand. The company insisted on its conference call that this isn’t the case and noted that its growing use of delayed payment options will result in “a dramatically lower level of customer deposits” going forward. Peloton’s share price fell more than 7% Thursday evening following the report, though the stock remains a pandemic standout with a 12-month gain of more than 370%.<br />Peloton is focused on shrinking its wait times, but it won’t be cheap. The company said Thursday it is now investing more than $100 million in expedited shipping to boost its delivery speed. It also said it is delaying the U.S. launch of its new treadmill from April to late May. It is still working to boost its manufacturing. Its $420 million acquisition of Precor, announced in December, was primarily meant to add domestic manufacturing capabilities to better serve North American customers. Precor’s North Carolina facilities are expected to be producing Peloton equipment by the end of this calendar year.</td>

As the latest version of Boeing’s long-range jetliner introduced in the 1990s, it features two giant, fuel-efficient engines and big wings that fold so they can pull up to airport gates.<br />Boeing’s bet is souring, however. Unlike with some of its other airplanes, Boeing’s recent 777X woes aren’t directly related to apparent design missteps or quality lapses. The plane’s troubles stem from the pandemic’s hit to international travel and broader market fallout, and a stiffer regulatory posture following Boeing’s missteps tied to a hazardous flight control system that led to two fatal crashes of its smaller 737 MAX jets.</td>

      <td>New Chief Executive Jim Farley wants to invest more aggressively in electric vehicles, but he still hasn’t fixed Ford’s combustion-engine business</td>
      <td>Ford  is embracing digital technology, and talking about it loudly, in an effort to catch up with both Tesla and General Motors. The new approach is boosting the stock, but rising expectations don’t come for free.<br />The big news in Ford’s fourth-quarter results, reported after the bell Thursday, was a massive acceleration in technology investments. Just over four months into the job, Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley pledged $22 billion through 2025 to electric vehicles and the digital technology involved in connecting them to the internet, as well as $7 billion to autonomous driving. This was after the company on Monday inked a far-reaching partnership with Google also centered on “connected” vehicles and the reams of data they will produce.<br />Mr. Farley promised more detail in the spring, but hinted that the company might invest in battery production, as GM has done through a partnership with South Korea’s  LG Chem .  The car industry is currently struggling to produce as many vehicles as it would like because of a global shortage of semiconductors; Ford “cannot afford” to face the same problems with batteries, Mr. Farley told analysts.<br />GM CEO Mary Barra shifted her primary focus from cost-cutting and efficiency to investment and growth last year—the same move Mr. Farley is now making. The difference is that GM had already tidied up its once-sprawling global empire and improved profitability before changing gears. After years of cost problems, Ford’s core U.S. business is still in the repair shop, raising the question of how it will fund technology investments of $29 billion—a sum equivalent to almost two-thirds of its market value.<br />The good news is that 2020 will almost certainly mark the trough for Ford’s profits, which have fallen for three consecutive years. The company has just started selling a new version of the F-150, its most important product, and a credible competitor to Tesla in the all-electric Mustang Mach-E. Later this year comes the much-anticipated new Bronco sport-utility vehicle. The company expects between $8 billion to $9 billion of adjusted operating profit in 2021, up from $2.8 billion last year, though its guidance excluded a potential hit of at least $1 billion from the current global chip shortage.</td>

      <td>Both companies reported blockbuster fourth quarters but Snap’s guidance fails to inspire</td>
      <td>Snapchat parent  Snap Inc.  and  Pinterest  have broadened their influence significantly over the past year, but only one can be 2021’s top socialite.<br />Both companies reported blockbuster fourth quarters on Thursday afternoon. Sales for Snap and Pinterest grew 62% and 76%, respectively, year-over-year, as advertisers saw particular value in investing in platforms relatively insulated from last year’s election controversy. That was well ahead of the 33% pace that  Facebook  announced last week, though from a much smaller base.<br />Pinterest and Snap have had blazing share price returns over the past 12 months, with both more than tripling, eclipsing Facebook and  Twitter .  Their outperformance reflects the market’s acknowledgment of the significant revenue potential coming in fields such as e-commerce through augmented reality and video—big pandemic winners. Both companies, for example, are leveraging the ability for users to “try on” customers’ products through AR technology. Those users are increasingly coming to both platforms with buying intent.<br />But that might be where the similarities end. As far as near-term risks go, Snap seems more exposed. Its Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen noted advertising declines in January after the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. (Pinterest didn’t.) He also noted the potential for decreased ad demand based on coming iOS changes that Facebook has also flagged. Snap’s updates spooked investors, driving its shares down more than 7% after hours even as Pinterest’s moved higher.<br />Going forward, advertisers certainly have more to consider than political and platform uncertainty. Snap and Pinterest have very different user bases, owning their respective niches while working to expand them. Snap continues to report reaching 90% of 13- to 24-year-olds and 75% of 13- to 34 year-olds in the U.S., noting Thursday that its sway among that demographic in many of its established markets continues to grow. Chief Executive Evan Spiegel also cited a 25% increase in viewership on its Discover platform among users over 35. Meanwhile, Pinterest has long said that it reaches most U.S. moms and that it has more recently reported making progress with younger users and men.</td>

Its role in the suddenly booming sector has been a bright spot as the bank took $1.3 billion in unexpected charges last year and weathered a spying scandal and high-profile company frauds.<br />Spearheading the blank-check business is head of SPACs Niron Stabinsky, who was hired in 2015 from Deutsche Bank AG. He and Credit Suisse have built relationships with some of the most prominent SPAC founders, including venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, veteran deal maker and Vegas Golden Knights owner Bill Foley, and real-estate investor Barry Sternlicht.

The class of therapies attracted attention after former President Donald Trump said a monoclonal antibodies drug helped him achieve a speedy recovery.</td>

      <td>Amazon.com ’s  new boss may come from the cloud. But the executive who helped pioneer elastic computing won’t be getting away from selling books, sweatpants and talking speakers soon.<br />Amazon announced earlier this week that Andy Jassy, current chief executive of the company’s AWS cloud division, will be running the whole company by the third quarter of this year. Mr. Jassy will succeed founder Jeff Bezos, and thus will be only Amazon’s second CEO in its 26-year history. Mr. Jassy has big shoes to fill, given Amazon’s place as the world’s second-largest public company by annual revenue, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.<br />Mr. Jassy’s role with AWS spawned the predictable avalanche of interpretations that the cloud is now Amazon’s most important business. But the numbers suggest that won’t be the reality even in the foreseeable future. Consider that Amazon’s direct retail revenue from its online and physical stores, plus its third-party selling services, exceeded $294 billion last year—more than six times what AWS generated.<br />Now throw in Amazon’s subscription revenue—mostly comprising the fees Prime members pay to guarantee free and fast shipping—and Amazon’s retail revenue last year rises to $319.2 billion. Retail actually outgrew AWS last year by 8 percentage points, thanks in part to the surge in e-commerce brought on by the pandemic. But more-normal growth going forward won’t change that picture much. Even if Amazon’s retail business stopped growing completely, and AWS maintained its 30% rate from 2020, it would still take the cloud eight years to overtake retail.<br />The cloud will most certainly remain vital to Amazon—especially in fueling its growing bottom line. And Mr. Jassy’s success with the venture has well earned him a shot at the top job. AWS on its own would now rank as the ninth-largest tech company in the S&P 500 by annual revenue. But retail remains key to Amazon’s future; AWS actually started as the company renting out the technical capacity it had built to service its e-commerce business. The new boss of the Everything Store will need to prove as proficient as his predecessor at doing everything.</td>

      <td>SMIC expects revenue growth to fall to single digits this year after a 17% jump in the last quarter</td>
      <td>HONG KONG—China’s largest maker of computing chips said restrictions placed by the Trump administration would crimp its pace of growth, despite the booming demand for semiconductors creating a global shortage.<br />Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.  in its first earnings report since it was added to a U.S. export blacklist on Dec. 18 on Friday said its revenue rose 17% to $981 million in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. The Shanghai-based company said it expects growth in revenue to slow to single-digit percentage points in the coming year.<br />SMIC executives lamented that if it weren’t for the U.S. restrictions, the company could have better capitalized on the global chip shortage that has benefited other manufacturers.<br />“After 20 years of independent technology development, market expansion, capacity building and the talent training, the company could have seized this year’s rare market opportunity and achieved rapid growth,” said Haijun Zhao, the company’s co-chief executive. If not for the U.S. actions and other risks, “SMIC could have maintained last year’s rapid growth momentum,” he said.<br />SMIC is one of China’s champions in the chip sector, an area in which Beijing has prioritized greater self-sufficiency. U.S. officials targeted the state-backed company with a raft of actions during the waning months of the Trump administration, alleging links to the Chinese military. SMIC has repeatedly denied military links.</td>

      <td>China’s leading domestic chip maker is getting lots of orders at the moment due to the global semiconductor shortage. The tech war with the U.S., however, will dent its ambitions.<br />Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.’s  revenue for the quarter ended December fell 9.4% from the previous quarter, but that was already better than expected given that the Chinese made-to-order chip maker is at the heart of the U.S.-China technology war. Demand for chips from its less advanced mature nodes was strong due to semiconductor shortages across the board.<br />But SMIC’s gross margin took a hit: It was 18% last quarter, down from 24.2% in the quarter before. The Trump administration’s salvo against Huawei Technologies meant SMIC wasn’t allowed to supply one of its major customers, especially with its more advanced technologies. The higher depreciation charges from its 14-nanometer plants likely took a toll too, according to Bernstein. Its most advanced nodes accounted for only 5% of revenue last quarter, compared with 14.6% in the previous quarter. SMIC’s Hong Kong-listed shares fell 10.6% Friday.<br />SMIC expects gross margin to be in the midteens this year and revenue to grow by a mid-to-high single digit percentage from last year. But since the company’s more mature nodes are already running at close to full capacity, its long-term growth will depend on whether it can build more capacity.<br />SMIC has budgeted $4.3 billion for capital spending this year to expand capacity, mostly for its more mature technologies. That is a drop from the $5.7 billion spent in 2020, which came after the company was forced to slash the target to $5.9 billion in November from $6.7 billion as the Trump administration placed export restrictions on the company in September that made it very difficult to source chip-making tools, especially for more advanced nodes. The U.S. government then formally put SMIC on the entity list in December. This year’s capital expenditure depends on how the Biden administration handles the technology war with China—it is possible that the U.S. government may allow the export of less sensitive technology to SMIC, but that isn’t a sure thing either.</td>

      <td>Investors’ love for Opendoor suggests it doesn’t matter if you win or lose in iBuying, but how you game the game</td>
      <td>Opendoor Technologies  appears to have solved the elusive iBuying equation, but the math is still a bit hazy.<br />Since competitor  Zillow  made its big push into iBuying in early 2019, investors have struggled to understand how such a capital intensive business so dependent on market fluctuations can reliably make money. They have good reason: In the most recent quarter reported, Zillow said it lost roughly $7,500 on average for each home it bought and subsequently sold after interest expense, despite the surge in overall real-estate prices last year. Zillow hasn’t yet shown profitability in its iBuying business on that basis in any quarter and losses seem to be accelerating.<br />But things appear different at Opendoor. The company made about $5,000 per home after interest expense in the first quarter of last year, according to a November analyst day presentation. And, unlike Zillow, its contribution margin increased significantly as the year progressed, rising from 1.9% in the first quarter to 4.8% in the third quarter. Dividing its contribution profit by the total number of homes it sold shows that Opendoor made an average of just under $13,000 per home in the third quarter after interest expense.<br />Could Opendoor really be nearly three times better at making money in iBuying than a company with roughly 10 years more experience in online real estate? Investors seem to think it has at least some advantage: Opendoor’s stock has soared 56% over the last three months, outperforming Zillow’s 48% gain.<br />But it seems hard to believe that, in the algorithmic-based business of iBuying, a more established company could get outplayed in the data game. A 2019 analysis done by Mike DelPrete, a scholar in residence on real-estate technology at the University of Colorado at Boulder, found both Opendoor and Zillow purchase homes for just over 1% less than the value of the home as determined by a real-estate title insurance company. Indeed, Zillow’s own analysis published last month showed it is offering within 0.09% of what a home goes on to sell for on the traditional market.</td>

      <td>More relaxed conditions for supporters have meant strict lockdowns for players</td>
      <td>One year after hosting the last major tennis tournament with thousands of real live fans, the Australian Open is set to present a truly shocking event in 2021: a major tennis tournament with a full house of real live fans.<br />Some 30,000 spectators a day are expected in Melbourne for what is turning into one of the most ambitious sporting events of the pandemic era. There have been weeks of charter flights, massive quarantines, and impromptu tune-up tournaments, all designed to deliver an approximation of the year’s first major.<br />And for the most part, it has worked. Despite complaints about cabin fever and the quality of room service, the sport’s superstars are all where they’re supposed to be and ready to play two weeks of tennis. Nine of the top 10 women in the world (plus Serena Williams) are due to play, along with nine of the top 10 men; only Roger Federer is out as he recovers from knee surgery.<br />But organizers are constantly reminded of how fragile the whole operation is. After a security guard at a tournament hotel tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, hundreds of players and staff were once again locked down pending negative tests. All of Thursday’s matches at Melbourne Park were suspended and the main tournament draw had to be delayed.<br />If the reaction seems extreme, it’s because the Australian state of Victoria has the virus under relative control—and it intends to keep it that way. Organizers insisted that it wouldn’t impact the tournament.</td>

      <td>Tech giant cites boost in pretax profit as reason for higher tax expense</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON— Amazon.com Inc.,  the company frequently cited by Democrats in their calls to raise corporate taxes, saw its tax liability jump last year as it prospered during the pandemic. But the technology giant, and others like it, could face even higher tax bills under the Biden administration’s plan for a minimum tax rate on profitable corporations.<br />Amazon reported $1.8 billion in current U.S. tax liability for 2020, a departure from the tiny or negative tax costs it posted in prior years. The company said a surge in pretax income last year led to the sudden rise in its reported tax expense.<br />In public-policy debates, Amazon’s taxes have often been reduced to allegations that it pays nothing, and that has long been an oversimplification. Still, Democratic control of the House, Senate and White House could matter a lot for the company. If President Biden’s proposed minimum tax had been in place for 2020, Amazon’s cash taxes would have been roughly double what it reported, according to an estimate from Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit publisher.<br />Amazon’s current U.S. tax expense, an accounting measure that is the closest approximation for its 2020 U.S. tax bill, was $1.835 billion on $20.2 billion of income, according to the annual financial statement filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That comes to a rate of about 9%, less than half of the 21% U.S. corporate rate but far higher than the equivalent 1.2% rate that Amazon reported for 2019 or its negative rates from 2017 and 2018.<br />The reason Amazon pays less than 21% stems, in part, from decisions by lawmakers. Amazon reported $639 million in tax credits, which companies can get for favored activities such as conducting research or investing in renewable energy. It also got $372 million from a break related to foreign sales from the U.S. and $1.1 billion in benefits from the way its workers’ stock-based compensation is treated.</td>

      <td>Americans usually rush out to buy things after an economic slump, but this time around there could be a surge in demand for services</td>
      <td>Here’s some advice for life after the pandemic: Make that restaurant reservation way in advance, prepare to pay up for that flight, get used to watching your team from the cheap seats and show up even earlier to the movie.<br />The slump caused by Covid-19 was unlike any other because consumer spending on services, which usually holds up well during downturns, cratered, and remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels. When the crisis eases—something that will with hope begin happening later this year, as more people get vaccinated—the recovery could be impressive.<br />Figuring out just how sharp that rebound will be is a matter of guesswork. While the limited experience the U.S. has with declines in spending on services suggests any rebound will be modest, Americans’ hankering to make up for all things they have missed out during the pandemic—and the ample savings many of them now have—suggests otherwise. The country could be on the cusp of a rebound in demand for services that will be hard for it to meet.<br />Whatever the actual outcome is, it will set the course for the economy. Spending on services amounts to about half of U.S. gross domestic product, while more than four in five U.S. jobs are in the service sector.<br />Usually, recessions are driven by weakness in spending on goods—items that run the gamut from socks to SUVs. That is because, even though Americans spend far more on services than on goods, big-ticket items in particular are easier to forgo when trouble starts. This downturn has been different not just because spending on services fell, but because, other than a brief period of weakness last spring, consumer spending on goods flourished as Americans bought items such as cars and washing machines in response to the pandemic. In the fourth quarter Commerce Department figures show that inflation-adjusted spending on goods was up 7.2% from a year earlier while spending on services fell 6.8% over the same period.</td>

      <td>REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED TO IMPEACH President Donald Trump start to attract primary challengers for 2022. Diante Johnson, an organizer with Black Voices for Trump last year and a field organizer with Trump’s 2016 campaign, has told associates he may launch a challenge to Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R., Ill.), depending on how the district looks after Democratic-led redistricting in the state this year.<br />According to a person familiar with his thinking, Johnson is leaning toward launching a bid, motivated by Kinzinger’s vote to impeach Trump and his overall opposition to the former Republican president. Kinzinger has said he is at peace with the possibility that he could lose re-election over his Trump stance and launched a political-action committee to support fellow anti-Trump Republicans.<br />In Michigan, an Afghanistan War veteran has threatened to challenge first-term Rep. Peter Meijer, who succeeded another member, former Rep. Justin Amash, who was run out of the Republican Party for supporting Trump’s first impeachment. In South Carolina, a state representative plans to primary Rep. Tom Rice, a conservative stalwart who surprised many with his vote to impeach.<br />Rep. Liz Cheney, the highest-ranking Republican to vote for impeachment, has attracted the most attention for her vote, and has split the party between those who want her stripped of her position and primaried, and those who remain supportive of her continued leadership. She won the first battle in that fight Wednesday by keeping her GOP conference post.<br />PROTECTING CONGRESS after the Jan. 6 riot is a shared goal among congressional leadership and security officials, but the particulars have led to disagreements among stakeholders. A bipartisan group of lawmakers wrote last week to House leaders requesting more flexibility in how members use security funds, especially when they are away from Capitol Hill in their home districts. They also asked for more protections related to their personal information, including their home addresses.</td>

      <td>One of the things theatrical webcasts have allowed me to do is catch up with well-received new plays whose brief off-Broadway runs I missed. Eleanor Burgess’s “The Niceties” had a month-long Manhattan Theatre Club engagement in 2018 and was subsequently taken up by regional companies all over the U.S., of which Madison’s Forward Theater is the latest. I can see why: “The Niceties” is a variation on David Mamet’s “Oleanna” in which the militant student (Samantha Newcomb) is a young Black woman and the benighted, condescending baby-boomer professor whom she seeks to bring down (Sarah Day) is a garrulous middle-aged left-winger who has never questioned her own wokeness. Like Mr. Mamet, Ms. Burgess has stacked the deck high, and the results feel less like an actual human transaction than a scripted, somewhat stilted debate with good-gal/bad-gal dramatic flourishes thrown in.<br />Jointly directed by DiMonte Henning and Jen Uphoff Gray, this production was filmed in what looks like an actual professor’s office. Ms. Day, whom I know from her work as a core-company member of Wisconsin’s American Players Theatre, America’s finest classical theater festival, gives a pitch-perfect performance—she always does—but Ms. Newcomb, who became one of APT’s apprentice actors in 2019, also leaves nothing to be desired. Would that “The Niceties” partook of even a part of the deeply layered ambiguities that drive the best dramas but it is as predictable as “Oleanna,” albeit in what is now a much safer way. Nevertheless, it is an effective vehicle for two first-class actors, and this production will definitely hold your attention.<br />—Mr. Teachout, the Journal’s drama critic, is the author of “Satchmo at the Waldorf.” Write to him at tteachout@wsj.com.</td>

      <td>Johnson & Johnson  asked U.S. regulators on Thursday to authorize the emergency use of its Covid-19 vaccine, setting the stage for a potential third vaccine to become available in the U.S. within weeks.<br />J&J’s move follows last week’s release of results from an international clinical trial showing that a single shot of the vaccine was 66% effective at preventing moderate and severe Covid-19 disease. In the U.S. portion of the trial, the vaccine was 72% effective at preventing disease.<br />The addition of J&J’s vaccine could jump-start a U.S. mass-vaccination campaign that has been choppy since it began in December. There has been a limited supply of the first two vaccines, from  Moderna Inc.  and  Pfizer ,  with its partner  BioNTech SE ,  and distribution roadblocks have caused a slower-than-expected pace of vaccinations.<br />J&J’s shot wouldn’t only boost the overall supply of Covid-19 vaccine doses, but also could simplify vaccinations for many because it is given in one dose. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are administered as two doses, three or four weeks apart. J&J’s vaccine also can be kept at higher refrigerated temperatures for a longer period than the first two vaccines.<br />The New Brunswick, N.J., company expects to have millions of doses available immediately upon authorization, federal officials have said. The company expects to make more than one billion doses in total this year globally. The U.S. government has purchased 100 million doses from J&J, which expects to supply that amount by midyear, a J&J spokesman said. The government has options to purchase more.</td>

Revenue slipped 2.6% to $2.41 billion, primarily due to the loss of contributions from its coupon-publishing unit, which was sold last year.<br />Chief Executive Robert Thomson said the latest quarter was the company’s most profitable in its current iteration, since it was split off in 2013 from the entertainment business, an entity now known as  Fox Corp.<br />He also said Dow Jones had its largest quarterly profit since News Corp acquired it in 2007, and that the long-struggling New York Post had achieved a profit. “That is the first profit in modern times, at the very least, for what was a chronic loss-making masthead founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton,” Mr. Thomson said.<br />The company’s book-publishing unit, HarperCollins Publishers, posted a 23% revenue increase to $544 million, while segment earnings jumped 65% to $104 million, led by such titles as Steve Doocy’s “The Happy in a Hurry Cookbook.”</td>

The Treasury Department said they discussed market functionality and recent trading practices in equity, commodity and related markets.<br />The Reddit-fueled frenzy in stocks such as  GameStop ,  a videogame retailer, and  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  has drawn scrutiny from regulators and prompted complaints that the trading, which sent some stock prices soaring, was manipulative.</td>

      <td>House Republicans fail to oblige the Democratic desire for GOP civil war.</td>
      <td>Nearly 70% percent of the House GOP voted to keep Liz Cheney in leadership on Wednesday. Meantime, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she regretted going down the rabbit hole of QAnon conspiracy theories. Not a bad 24 hours for Republicans trying to create a post-Trump future that could win back the suburbs.<br />Ms. Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, came under fire because she voted to impeach President Trump. She did not retreat. “Several Members have asked me to apologize for the vote,” Ms. Cheney told her colleagues, according to one source. “I owe you honesty. I owe you the truth. I cannot do that. It was a vote of conscience. It was a vote of principle—a principle on which I stand and still believe.”<br />Only 10 Republicans supported Mr. Trump’s impeachment. Yet the vote in favor of Ms. Cheney was 145-61. What a blow in particular to Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Trump wannabe who flew to Ms. Cheney’s home state last week to declare: “We are in a battle for the soul of the Republican Party, and I intend to win it.” Ms. Cheney still faces a potentially tough primary, but for now at least the GOP civil war is called off.<br />On Thursday, under pressure from all sides, Ms. Greene disavowed her past cuckoo rhetoric. “When I started finding misinformation, lies, things that were not true in these QAnon posts, I stopped believing it,” she said. School shootings are “absolutely real,” and 9/11 “absolutely happened,” she said. Her comments otherwise, Ms. Greene added, were “words of the past” that “do not represent my values.”<br />Democrats claimed Ms. Greene didn’t exactly say she was sorry, and she’s tweeting about her success online raising $175,000 by promising not to back down. Democrats on Thursday evening stripped Ms. Greene of her committee assignments on a largely party-line vote, 230-199, only weeks into her term.</td>

      <td>But the Republican Party still has a lot of work to do to counter radicalism and conspiracy theories.</td>
      <td>Liz Cheney won. She won’t lose her leadership position after her blistering statement supporting the impeachment of Donald Trump. The vote in the House Republican Conference Wednesday night wasn’t even close, it was reportedly 145-61. Her antagonists spent two weeks bragging they had it in the bag. She insisted on a vote and called their bluff. Suddenly people remembered: She was raised by a House whip.<br />What does it mean? It doesn’t turn the page on the Trump era in Congress but it does, tentatively, begin a new chapter. The pro-Trump group lost, and the We Exist in the Time After Trump forces won. The lopsidedness of the vote implies some sympathy for Ms. Cheney’s stand, or at least grudging respect for the idea of a vote of conscience. Some were likely glad to see someone stand up to a bully, even if they won’t. Some may have been thinking: Hmmm, maybe it wasn’t a good idea to offer quiet encouragement for an insurrection that left five people dead. Some no doubt worried Republicans would be seen as the party of knuckle-dragging louts if they removed the only woman in House leadership for doing what she thought was right.<br />The men who’d threatened her almost from the moment she backed impeachment were left looking like what they are—weak, emotional, spiteful and in the end incompetent. Rep. Matt Gaetz, who swanned around in his Elvis hair in Ms. Cheney’s Wyoming in an attempt to whip up a movement against her, looked especially silly, and left the conference meeting with no statement for the press. Which is exactly how Joe McCarthy left after Margaret Chase Smith gave it to him full in the face on the floor of the Senate 71 years ago.<br />Sometimes things repeat themselves neatly and in a way rich with meaning. (Though to be fair, Mr. Gaetz later tweeted and went on “Hannity,” but I’m sure McCarthy would have too if he could.)<br />Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, after letting Ms. Cheney twist in the wind for a few weeks, spoke forcefully in her support and called for unity. He didn’t relieve freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the QAnon-supporting conspiracist whose social-media accounts appear to have endorsed violence, anti-Semitism and denialism of historic events, of her committee assignments, which was wrong and a mistake.</td>

      <td>Whenever the government is in charge of allocating a scarce good in high demand, there will be rationing and political jockeying. So it is with vaccines as political brawls are breaking out in states over who should be next in line for shots.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended prioritizing shots based on occupation and health factors, but its guidelines are arbitrary and states don’t have to follow them. After nursing-home residents and health-care workers, the CDC says priority should go to those over age 75 and an expansive list of “frontline essential workers.”<br />Then come people 65 to 74 years old, as well as ages 16 to 64 with unspecified “underlying medical conditions which increase the risk of serious” complications plus “essential workers.” The latter include those who “work in transportation and logistics, food service, housing construction and finance, information technology, communications, energy, law, media, public safety, and public health.”<br />By that definition, who isn’t essential? The CDC says its guidelines are intended to “decrease death and serious disease as much as possible,” “preserve functioning of society” and “reduce the extra burden COVID-19 is having on people already facing disparities.” These are all laudable objectives, but the latter two involve political judgments.<br />Many states have already extended eligibility to anyone over 65 before other groups since seniors are at highest risk for severe illness. This has simplified the bureaucracy. Yet as seniors are taken care of and more shots become available, prioritizing people with certain health conditions or politically favored jobs will create a political morass.</td>

      <td>A Connecticut state Senator has a plan for mandatory voting.</td>
      <td>As states consider modifying their voting rules in the wake of the 2020 pandemic mess, the phrase “voter suppression” is being tossed around. To activists on the left, any loosening of election practices is a glorious expansion of the franchise, and any tightening, no matter how minor or politically neutral, is a cynical ploy.<br />What’s the limiting principle? That’s one question raised by a bill in Connecticut to make voting mandatory, on pain of a $20 fine. “Much like jury duty,” Will Haskell, a state Senator, argued in a co-written op-ed last month, “voting should be considered not just an opportunity but a patriotic obligation.”<br />Mr. Haskell has filed a bill to implement this. Here’s how it would work: Starting in 2024, every eligible Connecticut voter would have an obligation to cast a ballot, “with the option to leave such ballot blank.” Those who didn’t participate would later receive paperwork from the state, demanding an excuse. Accepted reasons would include “travel,” “illness,” and “conscientious objection.” Failing to give a good enough alibi would trigger the fine of $20, though the scofflaw could perform two hours of community service instead.<br />“The purpose of this policy isn’t to impose fines,” Mr. Haskell and his co-author said. Except that’s what it would do, dunning $20 from busy single moms, apolitical 19-year-olds, the homeless, or anybody who didn’t care about Election Day enough to remember it. Nonetheless, they argued, the plan “would obviously heighten turnout, moving us far closer to an inclusive and fully representative democracy.”<br />Hmmm. If some people are ambivalent about politics, it’s hard to see how coercing them into voting would improve democratic decision-making. But the attitude on the left is that turnout trumps all. Even basic voting requirements, like deadlines saying that mail ballots must arrive by Election Day, are now under fire for disenfranchising somebody.</td>

      <td>He revives the Obama policy of strengthening America’s enemies and harming its friends.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden implicitly campaigned on Warren G. Harding’s 1920 promise of “a return to normalcy.” But his administration is returning to Barack Obama’s abnormal Middle East strategy. A normal policy would respect the fundamental commandment of sound statecraft: Strengthen friends and punish enemies. It would distinguish between them by asking two simple questions: Which states have tended to shelter comfortably under the American power umbrella? And which have instead sought to destroy the American order? Israel, Turkey and the Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, have functioned as pillars of the postwar American order. By contrast, for the past 40 years Iran has tirelessly opposed the American security system.<br />Three details of Iran’s strategic position could make it more dangerous in the near future. First, the Persian Gulf contains five of the world’s 10 largest proven oil reserves, and Iran threatens to dominate the region. Second, Tehran is increasingly allied with both Russia and China. Third, outreach to Iran by the U.S. has deeply angered most of America’s Middle Eastern allies.<br />A normal policy would seek to contain Iran. Every president since Jimmy Carter regarded Iran as a threat—except Mr. Obama. His flagship policy was the Joint Cooperative Plan of Action, to which Mr. Biden is dedicated to return. The JCPOA won’t contain Iran. Its sunset clauses create a clear path for Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. By lifting sanctions, it supplies the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps with cash.<br />Mr. Obama also dispensed with traditional military deterrence. Tehran saw a green light to expand and arm its militia networks. By the time Mr. Obama left office, Tehran held substantial sway over four Arab capitals: Baghdad, Beirut, Damascus and Sana’a. Donald Trump returned to containment. While revitalizing deterrence and imposing sanctions, he also supported military and intelligence operations by allies, especially Israel, against Iran and its proxies. A new coalition of regional states developed and was formalized in the Abraham Accords.<br />Mr. Trump established significant leverage over Tehran. Mr. Biden appears intent on squandering it. Consider his Yemen policy. One of his first moves was to announce a review of the Trump administration’s designation of the Houthi movement as a terrorist organization. Iran is building up the Houthis as a Yemeni counterpart to Hezbollah. As Hezbollah threatens Israel with precision-guided rockets and missiles, so the Houthis are threatening Saudi Arabia. At the same time, the Houthis provide Iran with a perch on the Red Sea, which guards the approach to the Suez Canal from the Indian Ocean.</td>

If you’re one of the 323 million Americans who don’t live in Kansas City or Tampa Bay, you need to establish some kind of rooting interest. People have all sorts or reasons for how they choose a side, some as simple as liking the uniform colors.<br />My own tools are a bit more obscure, but they may help others provide a cheering rationale.<br />There is the Baconesque technique of rooting for a Chiefs win so that the Jets could indirectly be the best team in the National Football League because in the regular season they beat the Rams who beat the Seahawks who beat the Dolphins who beat the Raiders who beat the Chiefs. Voilà.<br />Some choose based on the city itself. Who doesn’t love a small-market team over Los Angeles, New York or Boston? No immense metropolises are involved this year, but the Tampa area is 50% larger than metro Kansas City. It is also unfairly warmer. Advantage: Chiefs.</td>

      <td>The announcement that Israel would normalize ties with Muslim-majority Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates might have been the highlight of an otherwise dismal 2020. Yet these groundbreaking accords still lack one important child of Abraham. Do Near Eastern Christians have a seat at this table? If not, who can help get them there?<br />Years of international anxiety over the slow demise of Christianity in its ancient homeland hasn’t translated into action. The situation in old bastions like Lebanon, Syria and Iraq is now catastrophic. Egypt, with the largest population of Jesus followers in the region, isn’t much better. That the region’s second most afflicted religious group—after the devastated Yazidis—has gained the least from a long-overdue peace is a painful irony not lost on its persecuted members.<br />Part of the problem is that the regional hostility being rolled back under the Abraham Accords was never a distinctly Christian problem. The centurylong animus between Muslims, the region’s largest group, and Jews, its oldest Abrahamic population and newest recipient of sovereignty, could only be rectified by Jews and Muslims. The relative lack of Christians in any the four Muslim countries that are part the Abraham Accords—Israel has as many as all of them combined—means that Christians simply haven’t been part of the discussion.<br />Another thorny problem is the imprisonment of the region’s most dynamic Christian communities in its other geopolitical axis: the resistance bloc controlled by Iran. Tehran’s belligerence is what first seeded the secret Arab-Israeli collaboration that now manifests as open solidarity. Trapped in the northern tier of Mesopotamia, sandwiched between Shiite and Sunni proxies of Iran and Turkey, these Christians dare not whisper a positive word about normalization with Israel.<br />One final problem is the general lack of Christian sovereignty in the Near East, which precludes them from an independent say on the matter. With the exception of Greece, Armenia and Ethiopia, local Christians—unlike local Jews, who gained independence in 1948—remain subservient players in an Arab conversation that is almost exclusively Muslim.</td>

      <td>Adam Grant is an organizational psychologist at the Wharton School with a talent for delivering comfortable truths. In his first book, “Give and Take” (2013), he argued that the most generous people in the workplace can achieve extraordinary success. In “Originals,” published three years later, he wrote that many effective entrepreneurs, rather than the early-rising obsessives one imagines, are procrastinating generalists.<br />He has a knack for turning the base metal of the Journal of Applied Behavioral Science into life-affirming Oprah gold, and in his latest book, “Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know,” he’s in vintage form. His aim is to “explore how rethinking happens,” how we change our minds, how we persuade others, and how we build cultures of lifelong learning. “This book is an invitation to let go of knowledge and opinions that are no longer serving you well,” he writes, “and to anchor your sense of self in flexibility rather than consistency.”<br />“Think Again” is full of interesting asides culled from academic research. People who are good at math tend to be good at seeing patterns in data, unless those patterns contradict their views, in which case their intelligence becomes a “weapon against the truth.” The more clever people are, the less willing they are to admit the limitations of their thinking.<br />Mike Lazaridis, the precocious electronics wizard who founded BlackBerry, led his company to a valuation of $70 billion by 2008, only to lead it back into oblivion. He clung to the notion that email was the most important feature of a mobile device, even when the market was turning toward the all-in-one charms of the iPhone.<br />Mr. Grant’s answer to Mr. Lazaridis is that we must think more like scientists and less like preachers, prosecutors or politicians. We should be humble about our convictions and beliefs, curious about the alternatives, and open to discovery and experimentation.</td>

Read previous columns here.<br />When a winter storm blanketed the Northeast this week, it shut down cities, snarled traffic and dumped as much as 30 inches of snowfall in parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. But was it a “blizzard?”<br />Not if you ask the National Weather Service. Their reports on the storm avoided the word “blizzard,” instead referring to it as a “large scale snowstorm and Nor’easter.”<br />The storm matched the general profile of a “Nor’easter,” since it moved along the East Coast with powerful winds blowing in from the northeast. But the weather service uses a specific definition of “blizzard” favored by meteorologists. For a storm to qualify, it must have sustained gusts of wind in excess of 35 miles an hour for at least three hours, with the blowing snow limiting visibility to less than a quarter of a mile.<br />This week’s snowstorm evidently did not make the cut—unlike, say, the twin blizzards in January and February 1978 that hit the central and northeastern U.S. with historic strength. This time around, the ingredients of a blizzard—the falling or blowing snow, the sustained winds, and the reduced visibility—may have all been in play individually but did not occur together for three hours.</td>

The company spent about $1.9 billion on such expenses last year.<br />The added burden pushed T-Mobile’s fourth-quarter net income to $750 million, or 60 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier result of $751 million, or 87 cents a share.

Mr. Parnas has pleaded not guilty. The trial, which was supposed to begin in March, has been pushed back without a firm date.<br />The SEC’s allegations expand on those outlined by federal prosecutors, accusing Messrs. Correia and Parnas of raising more than $2 million from investors for Fraud Guarantee, which they used to pay for “lavish personal expenses” unrelated to the company.<br />Fraud Guarantee billed itself as a company that developed products to help customers recover losses from investment or consumer fraud.

Tradeweb is one of the largest electronic marketplaces for Treasurys.<br />Other firms are also seeing a surge in trading. On Tuesday, competitor  MarketAxess Holdings Inc.  reported average daily trading volume on its online credit trading platform at a record $12.4 billion in January, exceeding last March.<br />The pickup in trading volumes is notable because it follows a banner year for electronic bond-trading platforms.

Others have joined the fray, including Volkswagen AG  and, last week, General Motors Corp.<br />That tilt is now paying off on Volvo’s home turf, where the strategy coincided with an aggressive push by EU officials to promote EVs. After early skepticism, European car buyers are warming up.<br />Håkan Samuelsson, Volvo’s chief executive, said Thursday the company is on track to shift half of its sales to fully electric vehicles by 2025. Volvo launched its first battery electric car last year, the XC40 compact SUV, and plans to launch another fully electric car this year.<br />The company said it sold 115,436 plug-in electric cars world-wide last year, about 17% of its total sales of 661,713 vehicles. In Europe, plug-ins accounted for 36% of total sales in the second half and 31% for the full year, driven by sales of the XC40 battery electric model, and the XC60 and V60 plug-in vehicles.</td>

The law empowers platforms to compete for users by creating a variety of forums—from kid-safe and family-friendly to the more provocative and disturbing. It gives small businesses the chance to meaningfully compete against larger companies by saving them from the threat of devastating legal fees. That means Section 230 fosters a competitive internet where all users can engage in forums that best meet their unique needs.<br />Trace Mitchell<br />NetChoice<br />Washington</td>

Friedman (Books, Jan. 30). I have always been taught that the Christian view of work is based on the doctrine of vocation. Martin Luther, studying scripture, came to realize that, while the work of the priesthood is of vital importance, the work of ordinary believers had a dignity of its own which is also honored, and those in ordained offices should not be viewed as being on a higher plane than secular professions and family life. Luther wrote in a 1522 sermon: “When a prince sees his neighbor oppressed, he should think: That concerns me! I must protect and shield my neighbor. . . . The same is true for the shoemaker, tailor, scribe, or reader. If he is a Christian tailor, he will say: I make these clothes because God has bidden me do so, so that I can earn a living, so that I can help and serve my neighbor.”<br />The scriptural basis for this is summarized in Colossians 3:23-24 which says, whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.<br />Matthew Henry (1662-1714) wrote regarding this passage: “It sanctifies a servant’s work when it is done as unto God—with an eye to his glory and in obedience to his command, and not merely as unto men, or with regard to them only.”<br />Duncan Merritt<br />Vestavia Hills, Ala.</td>

She cites his 1800 letter to Benjamin Rush as evidence of Jefferson’s commitment to “the freedom of religion established in the First Amendment.” Jefferson was indeed passionate about religious freedom, as his letter to Rush shows, but he never thought the First Amendment “established” that freedom. Like his friend James Madison, who wrote the First Amendment, Jefferson understood religious freedom as among those natural rights that governments are formed to secure, not to establish. The founders believed that the right itself pre-existed the Constitution and, as an unalienable endowment of the creator, pre-existed government itself.<br />David Collins<br />Chicago</td>

Consumer advocacy groups have reached similar conclusions in recent years.<br />(Read a Q&A on heavy metals in baby foods and the congressional report)<br />These heavy metals naturally occur in soil and water. Baby food makers say that their products contain these metals at levels that are safe and that they are already working at reducing their presence by looking for new suppliers and cultivation methods.<br />The Democratic majority of the subcommittee says the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates food safety, should mandate maximum levels of these metals for baby food. Exposure to heavy metals in food can be harmful to brain development in children, according to the FDA, but the extent of potential harm from the levels found in baby foods is unclear. The agency has set voluntary guidance for how much arsenic or lead can be in some foods.</td>

      <td>Democrats are calling for broad distribution, while Republicans have proposed a more-targeted approach</td>
      <td>Republicans have called for a more-targeted approach to a third round of stimulus checks, while Democrats have argued that broad distribution is necessary to cover gaps in other federal programs. Here is a look at the proposals, which differ both on the size of the payment and in who is eligible.<br />President Biden has proposed checks of $1,400 per person as part of his $1.9 trillion aid plan, effectively topping up the $600 payments from December to $2,000. Democrats promised that amount during the Senate campaigns in Georgia that gave them the majority, and Mr. Biden has shown no signs of budging on that.<br />The Biden proposal didn’t specify the income levels at which the checks would start shrinking, and officials said they were open to discussions on that. In the past rounds, the payments began shrinking once adjusted gross income reached $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples. But Democrats in recent days have talked about setting those levels at $50,000 and $100,000.<br />A group of 10 Senate Republicans has proposed scaling back the checks to $1,000 per adult and $500 per dependent adult and child. The Republican plan would reduce the size of the checks for individuals making $40,000 a year or more and phase them out entirely when income reaches $50,000. Married couples with a joint annual income above $80,000 would see smaller checks, going to zero when income reaches $100,000. The plan didn’t specify the phaseout rules for households with children.<br />The proposals mean that a married couple with two children would receive up to $5,600 from the Democratic plan and $3,000 from the GOP alternative. The Republicans estimate their proposal for the checks would cost $220 billion, less than half the cost of the Democratic plan that the House passed in December.</td>

      <td>In France’s Oscar entry, Martine Chevallier and Barbara Sukowa play closeted lovers looking forward to a new life together.</td>
      <td>‘Two of Us,” France’s Oscar entry, is set mainly in a quiet residential neighborhood in southern France—the unspecified locale is Montpellier and its environs. But the story plays out on a shifting border between grand amour and amour fou—a passion burns steadfastly bright while desperation opens the door to madness. And physical doors keep opening and closing; it’s as if a modern-day Feydeau had turned from farce to romance and impending tragedy. This debut film by Filippo Meneghetti, streaming on major digital platforms, is elevated by the beauty of its performances, and by its masterly technique, which would suggest a filmmaker at the height of his career, not someone directing his first feature. Most remarkably, though, the drama captures the timeless essence of unconditional, all-consuming love through a pair of unlikely heroines, two women in their 70s who maintain separate apartments across the hall from each other.<br />They met decades ago in Rome and have lived in France ever since, lesbian lovers still awkwardly and affectingly closeted because one of them, Madeleine (Martine Chevallier), could never bring herself to break away from her husband and family. Now, after the recent death of Mado’s husband, she and her partner, Nina, a Berliner by birth played by the distinguished German star Barbara Sukowa, have plans for a bright future—leaving France and living the life they’ve always dreamed of, together in Rome. (The film, in French with English subtitles, was originally called “Deux,” a better title that bespeaks the strength of their bond.) But Mado suffers a failure of courage, followed by a stroke that leaves her paralyzed, unable to speak and dependent on a caregiver who sees Nina only as the next-door neighbor, not her charge’s surpassingly significant other. Romance devolves into obsession, devotion into horror, as Mado grows increasingly isolated and Nina fights for every opportunity to be close to the woman she loves.<br />When movies are as memorable as this one, it’s seldom because the plot is stunningly original. Elements of this story have come forth in various combinations over the past few years. What gives “Two of Us” its singular power is the hurtling urgency of the storytelling and the brilliance of the acting. Mr. Meneghetti and his script collaborators, Malysone Bovorasmy and Florence Vignon, hedge no bets, observe no constraints. For the caregiver, Muriel, a drab yet paradoxically vivid woman played by Muriel Bénazéraf, Nina becomes an adversary in an undeclared custody battle. For Mado’s daughter Anne (Léa Drucker) and son, Frédéric (Jérôme Varanfrain), their mother’s friend and neighbor is inexplicably intrusive. (The siblings’ naiveté may seem equally inexplicable as described, but it’s believable as dramatized.) For Nina, meanwhile, proximity to Mado is nothing less than a matter of life or death.<br />Which is how the actress plays it. In the radiance of her youth Ms. Sukowa was the protégée and muse of the German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and later the star of hard-edged political films by Margarethe von Trotta. Her performance here is fearless, to say the least; it’s also fevered, frightening and transcendent, with no concern for clear boundaries, just as Nina’s behavior is, by turns, selfless, selfish, admirable, reckless and self-destructive. (Depending on the scene, the superb cinematographer Aurélien Marra makes Ms. Sukowa look shockingly haggard or startlingly beautiful; the truth of the moment trumps the aesthetics.)<br />And one great performance is reflected, and complemented, by another. Ms. Chevallier’s portrayal of Mado, so full of life at the outset, becomes of necessity a study in mysterious nuance. In Mado’s diminished state, how well does she understand what’s happening to her? What is she feeling as she sits in her wheelchair, gazing into an unfathomable mid-distance?</td>

      <td>FBI Agent Clarice Starling returns in a new CBS series.</td>
      <td>It would be best to temper any expectation of a horrorfest to come in “Clarice,” despite the title character’s prominent role in the Thomas Harris novels “The Silence of the Lambs” (1988) and “Hannibal” (1999), not to mention the 1991 “Silence” film starring Jodie Foster as FBI agent Clarice Starling. All the drama of this sharply written new tale is focused devotedly on Clarice, now portrayed with heart and intelligence by Rebecca Breeds.<br />Borne up by wit and an undeniable emotional punch, the CBS series has its beginnings in the early 1990s—roughly a year after the terrors that occurred in “The Silence of the Lambs.” Agent Starling—who had, many months earlier, rescued a young woman imprisoned in the basement of the monstrous predator known as Buffalo Bill—now finds herself the recipient of an urgent message from that young woman’s mother, Ruth Martin. Who, as it happens, holds the position of attorney general. The attorney general (an electrifying Jayne Atkinson) urges Agent Starling to join up with the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program, or Vicap (an actual FBI program). She’s needed to help solve the case of three new serial killings.<br />It’s not a surprising request. Clarice has, as she regularly proves, unique gifts as a crime analyst. One scene has her noting the psychological pretensions of one murderer. The killer was desperate to leave proof that he was impassioned, a man on fire, when in fact, Agent Starling concludes, he was “cold as hell. The wounds he made shows it.”<br />Starling will turn her attention to those three serial killings, but not without dismay. On no subject is she more opposed to the views of her superiors than in the matter of serial killers—which is the instantly agreed upon official answer when any mysterious murder takes place. This is intolerable to Clarice, who believes in much more detailed consideration of the evidence, and who is ever skeptical of received wisdom. She is, as well, unworried about contradicting others—whether her fellow agents or her FBI superiors. It’s the FBI superiors who give her trouble, but she’s been told more than once that her fellow FBI agents aren’t fond of her either—information that fails to trouble her. In this decidedly confident and glamorous character—the product of a far from idyllic childhood who has endured the most harrowing of experiences at the hands of psychopathic killers—the series has its social commentator: the one who understands the motives for everything going on. She’s quick to figure out, for instance, that the reason officials in the agency jump to the conclusion that the latest murder is the work of a serial killer has something to do with the attention the subject brings. It’s sensational news—the kind that attracts the press.<br />No event in the story available thus far (just three of the 13 episodes were provided for review) showed more potential for the sensational than the one in which Clarice and her FBI colleagues have to do battle with rogue militia types who make it entirely clear that they don’t recognize the authority of the U.S. government. Here they are also guilty of shooting a federal officer. The series takes considerable notice of the history of anti-government insurgents. There’s mention of Waco, Texas—site of the 1993 siege that lasted nearly two months at the compound of the Branch Davidians, a struggle that involved ATF agents, the U.S. military and Texas law enforcement, and ended with a toll of nearly 80. The mention of Waco is raised as a kind of warning and a pledge—whatever action the FBI of this series undertakes, it must not result in another Waco.</td>
