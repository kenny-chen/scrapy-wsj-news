      <td>Seventy years ago, Maine’s first female senator distinguished herself for her courage and integrity.</td>
      <td>History can sometimes help us through current moments by showing what’s needed and providing inspiration.<br />This year marks the 70th anniversary of a great act by a great lady. Margaret Chase Smith was a U.S. representative from 1940-49 and a senator from 1949-73. Her name is always followed by “the first”—the first woman to serve as a senator from Maine, first to serve in both the House and Senate, first to have her name placed in nomination for the presidency at a major party convention.<br />She was generally considered a moderate to liberal Republican, and sometimes called a progressive one. She wanted to provide citizens the help they needed to become fully integrated into society and productive within it.<br />She was independent and made this clear early. She was initially the only member from Maine to support Lend-Lease and extension of the draft. She survived these votes because she understood her state: It was isolationist but also patriotic, against war but for preparedness, and Mainers didn’t like partisanship messing with foreign policy. She was for civil rights, supported Social Security and Medicare. She had a strong sense of where she was from, and felt the civic romance of it. She told biographer Patricia L. Schmidt that she loved Maine’s small-town church spires, and her dream was to see that each town had the money to buy a spotlight so the white spires could be seen for miles at night.<br />She faced criticism from the right. No, she’d blandly state on being questioned, union leaders hadn’t endorsed her in the last election, but she couldn’t help it if union members loved her.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—White House communications director Alyssa Farah has resigned, a sign that Trump administration officials have begun to move on even as President Trump refuses to concede that he lost to President-elect Joe Biden.<br />“It’s been the honor of a lifetime to serve in the Trump Administration over the last 3 and a half years,” Ms. Farah, 31 years old, tweeted Thursday evening. Before joining the White House communications team in April, Ms. Farah served as a press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence and then served as press secretary at the Defense Department. Ms. Farah didn’t respond to a request for comment.<br />Her departure comes as Mr. Trump continues to claim widespread fraud in the Nov. 3 presidential election, an allegation his legal team hasn’t substantiated in court. Key states have certified their results in favor of Mr. Biden. No evidence has surfaced of widespread fraud.<br />Ms. Farah worked closely with the White House coronavirus task force and on Thursday praised the speedy work on a vaccine.<br />Other administration staffers have been looking for jobs on Capitol Hill, with outside firms and Fox News, according to people familiar with the discussions.</td>

      <td>An Old Norse word for a twisty underwater creature has surfaced in a Liam Neeson meme and a pro-Trump legal threat</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />When Merriam-Webster and Dictionary.com announced their selections for Word of the Year on Monday, it was not terribly surprising that both selected “pandemic” as the word that best summed up 2020, based on search traffic of their online dictionaries. But the runners-up include some more unexpected items. One word highlighted by Merriam-Webster is especially intriguing: “kraken.”<br />How did this name for a mighty, mythical Scandinavian sea monster become one of the most significant terms of 2020? The answer has to do with movie memes, professional hockey and electoral conspiracy theories.<br />Stories of the “kraken” originated in the tall tales told by sailors of a gigantic creature living in the waters off the coasts of Norway and Greenland. The word itself can be traced back to the Old Norse “kraki,” which became “krake” in Norwegian and Swedish, referring to something twisted or crooked. (“Crooked,” in fact, comes from the same source.) In the form “kraken,” the word got applied to twisty underwater animals both real and imagined. The kraken of Nordic legends was likely based on actual sightings of giant squid and octopuses, but folklore embellished it into a monstrosity capable of creating massive whirlpools and swallowing up even the largest ships.<br />The word “kraken” entered English in the mid-18th century thanks to translations of a natural history written by the Norwegian bishop Erik Pontoppidan, who described the beast in vivid detail. Stories of the kraken captivated the imagination of many writers, including Alfred Lord Tennyson, who titled an 1830 poem “The Kraken.” Tennyson imagined the Kraken slumbering in an “ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep” before awaking with apocalyptic fury.</td>

      <td>The 36-year-old’s career includes six months as a local prosecutor and a book interpreting the Constitution through a biblical lens</td>
      <td>Four years ago, Jenna Ellis was a young Colorado attorney practicing in county courts, defending clients in domestic-abuse cases and teaching legal classes at a local Christian university.<br />Today, she is a key part of the Trump campaign’s legal team, helping to lead an effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election result with claims of widespread ballot fraud and other abuses. Numerous state election officials say there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election, and federal officials have said it was the most secure ever conducted.<br />Ms. Ellis, 36 years old, is part of what she called an “elite strike force” of Trump lawyers introduced by Rudy Giuliani at a Nov. 14 press conference at Republican National Committee headquarters. President Trump praised Ms. Ellis that day on Twitter as part of his “truly great” legal team.<br />“I’m the Cinderella story of the legal world,” Ms. Ellis said in an interview, noting that she had come from neither a Big Law background nor attended an Ivy League school.<br />Ms. Ellis has been an outspoken presence for the Trump team, appearing regularly on cable news and helping stage a series of events with state lawmakers to air allegations of voter irregularities. Historians and election-law specialists have called the Trump campaign’s efforts unprecedented.</td>

      <td>The President will get the blame if the GOP loses the Senate.</td>
      <td>The most important story in politics for the next month isn’t the foregone outcome of the presidential race. It’s the two Georgia runoff races on Jan. 5 that will determine who controls the Senate and the direction of U.S. policy for the next two years. If Republicans lose those seats, President Trump will be the main reason, and the main casualty will be his legacy.<br />The two Republicans should be favorites. Georgia is changing and Mr. Trump narrowly lost the state, but it still leans center-right. Incumbent David Perdue nearly won the 50% he needed to avoid a runoff, and Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff couldn’t win a House race in the Atlanta suburbs in 2017.<br />Appointed incumbent Kelly Loeffler survived a brutal primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, but the state party is now united behind her. Her challenger, pastor Raphael Warnock, is a genuine man of the left who has been arrested at social-justice protests and believes in the Bernie Sanders canon.<br />The argument that the country needs a GOP Senate to check a President Biden and Speaker Nancy Pelosi should resonate with voters now that it’s clear President Trump has lost. The problem is that Mr. Trump keeps stepping on that argument, and muddling the GOP message, with his claims that Democrats in Georgia and elsewhere stole the election. The polls show tight races that Democrats could win.<br />Mr. Trump has tweeted endorsements of the two Republicans, and he plans to attend a rally in Valdosta on Saturday evening. But he’s also attacking GOP Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger for not overturning the result in a state he lost by 12,670 votes. It’s an unfair rap, as the state conducted a hand recount of every ballot. Mr. Trump lost the race by doing worse in the Atlanta suburbs than in 2016, as he also did in many other suburbs around the country.</td>

      <td>Small investments help prevent major distractions later on.</td>
      <td>Two decades after 9/11, Washington understandably is concerned more with great-power competition than terrorism. But a new report from the Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP) is a reminder that terror groups remain a global scourge.<br />First, some good news: In 2019 the death toll from terrorism around the world fell for the fifth year in a row, according to IEP’s Global Terrorism Index. Deaths declined 59% between 2014 and last year, but nearly 14,000 people still died in terrorist incidents. While far-right political terrorism is on the rise, the report notes that it’s generally less lethal than Islamist terrorism and “the absolute number of far-right attacks remains low.”<br />One reason for declining deaths is that the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State made the world safer. The report attributes 942 killings over 339 attacks to the group in 2019. It marks the first time that ISIS has been responsible for fewer than 1,000 deaths since it became active in 2013.<br />“Despite the decrease in activity from ISIL in the Middle East and North Africa, ISIL’s affiliate groups remain active across the world, and have become especially prominent in sub-Saharan Africa,” according to the report, which uses an alternative acronym for ISIS. “The expansion of ISIL affiliates into sub-Saharan Africa led to a surge in terrorism in many countries in the region. Seven of the ten countries with the largest increase in terrorism were in sub-Saharan Africa.”<br />Americans might reasonably wonder why they should care about jihadist attacks in Africa. The greatest threat of groups like ISIS and al Qaeda is to the lives of innocents everywhere. But there are significant economic costs too. “The global economic impact of terrorism was US$16.4 billion in 2019,” the report estimates. This is a “highly conservative” calculation that doesn’t include indirect effects on business and investment.</td>

      <td>The U.K. on Wednesday approved  Pfizer -BioNTech’s vaccine, and no doubt many Americans are wondering as thousands die each day why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wasn’t first. Blame politicians who promoted public skepticism of a vaccine that U.S. regulators now feel they must remedy.<br />Two weeks ago Pfizer and BioNTech applied to the FDA for emergency use authorization of their vaccine, which they reported was 95% effective. The FDA then scheduled an online public meeting on Dec. 10 with outside experts to discuss the authorization and allowed the public to submit comments.<br />FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn tweeted Thursday: “Send your comments in before this group of outside experts meets to discuss a potential emergency use authorization for a #COVID19 vaccine.” This is a nice gesture toward transparency and democracy, but isn’t this supposed to be a scientific review?<br />These outside “experts” will also have less knowledge than FDA scientists who have been working alongside vaccine makers over the last nine or so months providing real-time feedback on their clinical trials. Mr. Hahn, however, committed to this process in the fall as Democrats like Kamala Harris and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned the Trump Administration was rushing approval.<br />In other words, this regulatory rigmarole is essentially a placebo to reassure the public it will be safe to get inoculated. There’s no evidence that a three-week review is needed. The U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency with 1,320 employees scrutinized Pfizer’s data on a rolling basis, and the FDA with 17,000 staff could do the same.</td>

She declined to comment through a Huawei spokesman. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. Canadian officials didn’t immediately return requests for comment<br />Arrested two years ago while transferring planes in Vancouver, Ms. Meng has been confined to the city, where she has a home. She has since fought extradition to the U. S.—a process allowing multiple appeals that can take years to resolve—and her situation has personified for many in China attempts by Washington to stymie the country’s global ascent.</td>

      <td>Can he hold it? The answer will set the course of Biden’s presidency.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden isn’t yet in the White House, but we are about to witness a crucial test of his ability to roll a closely divided Senate. Republicans can hold the line on Covid relief, or a divided GOP can signal that Biden Democrats will hold the whip hand on spending.<br />Majority Leader Mitch McConnell drew the line this week, circulating a straightforward virus-relief bill that checks bipartisan boxes. As Mr. McConnell noted, the bill delivers “right away on all the subjects where everybody agrees”—more funding for small businesses, vaccine distribution and extended unemployment aid, as well as legal certainty for hospitals, schools and religious groups. Better yet, the bill repurposes some $569 billion of unused virus funds—offsetting the entirety of his bill’s cost. Immediate, targeted aid for those Americans still hurting, at no additional expense to the U.S. taxpayer. What’s not to like?<br />Yet pressure is mounting on the GOP to double or quadruple the dollars. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have climbed aboard a $900 billion bipartisan Senate proposal that would throw money at state and local governments, revive the ill-conceived “enhanced” unemployment benefit, and bail out public transport. And although that bill was negotiated in good faith, it has already been taken hostage. Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer explained that they’ve adopted it only as their “basis” for further negotiation, and are already promising “improvements”—likely hundreds of billions of them.<br />The press is weighing in, casting the McConnell bill as Scrooge-like and inadequate. Mrs. Pelosi is again warning that “the economy will fall into double-dip recession without additional federal relief from Congress.” Even some Republicans argue the party can win the two outstanding Georgia Senate seats only by one-upping Democrats on spending.<br />This fight is rapidly coming to represent something much more significant than a simple dollar figure. Internally, smart Republicans are arguing that this is about the GOP standing for basic principles and good governance, even as it sets the tone for future spending negotiations with a Biden administration.</td>

On Oct. 29, a 20-year-old Tunisian, who had been refused asylum in Italy after arriving by boat the month before, showed up in the south of France. He stabbed to death two worshipers and a sacristan in the Notre Dame Basilica in Nice.<br />Even before the incidents Mr. Macron had made a major speech about Islamist “separatism.” He aims to limit the sponsoring of imams by foreign governments. He has dissolved organizations allegedly sympathetic to Islamic radicalism, such as the charity BarakaCity and the “antiracist” Collective against Islamophobia. He plans to ban home schooling, popular among religious Muslims.<br />Mr. Macron is putting almost all his eggs in the basket of laïcité, the 115-year-old French system for regulating religion. (The word means “secularism.”) At a meeting with the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM), an official Islamic umbrella group created almost two decades ago by then Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, Mr. Macron added more detail. The CFCM would create a “national council of imams.” Preachers would be accredited, or licensed, like doctors and lawyers. By next week the CFCM is expected to create a “Charter of Republican Values” to which the organizations that make it up will adhere. “Some will sign and some will not,” the president reportedly said at the meeting. “We will be watching. Either you are with the Republic or you are not.”<br />In recent weeks Mr. Macron has taken to browbeating the Anglophone press, notably the Financial Times and the New York Times. They mistake his hostility to Islamism for a hostility to Islam, he complains, and misunderstand the logic by which laïcité mediates between religion and the state. Do they really? More likely they have simply looked at France’s Islam policy over the past two decades and begun to question whether laïcité is the right tool for it.</td>

      <td>Brent crude, the international gauge for oil prices, may be overhauled to reflect the growing importance of U.S. exports in global energy markets.<br />By March 2022, S&P Global Platts is likely to start using crude drilled from wells near Midland, Texas, in setting the price of Dated Brent, a gauge that has historically reflected physical oil prices in Europe’s North Sea. The price-reporting agency on Thursday began consulting market participants on the proposed change, and aims to conclude the review by February.<br />Set daily by Platts, Dated Brent is a pivotal cog in the global oil market. It bears parallels to the role of the Libor interest-rate benchmark in its heydays, or that of 10-year Treasury yields in global credit markets.<br />Since the late 1980s, Dated Brent has acted as the benchmark on which the majority of traded barrels of oil in the world are priced. It also helps to determine prices for the Brent-crude futures contracts that oil producers, commodity traders and investors buy and sell on  Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s  marketplace.<br />For years, however, Dated Brent has faced a major problem. Brent, drilled from underneath the East Shetland Basin off the coast of Scotland, is fast running out. Platts responded by introducing different varieties of crude oil produced in the North Sea into its calculations. Dated Brent has evolved into a basket of crudes, including not just its namesake but Forties, Ekofisk, Troll and Oseberg. But supplies of other North Sea crudes are also depleting alongside those of Brent.</td>

      <td>Job openings declined sharply in August, after the $600 weekly payments stopped.</td>
      <td>Congressional Democrats and some Republicans are frantically trying to stitch together another $1 trillion “stimulus” bill. Why? The economy and jobs market have far exceeded expectations of recovery even without the spending spree first proposed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi in July.<br />Since then, employers have added six million jobs—more than the Federal Reserve and the Congressional Budget Office predicted they would. The unemployment rate fell from 13% to 6.9% in six months, no stimulus necessary.<br />In July we warned on these pages that six more months of $600-a-week bonus unemployment benefits would keep millions of Americans out of the workforce. The CBO calculated that “roughly five of six recipients” were getting more from unemployment payments than they would earn from working. Many workers could get twice as much income for staying unemployed.<br />Yet the CBO and many academic economists strangely concluded that continuing these payments (on top of normal unemployment benefits) would be good for the economy because of their effect on consumer spending. Paul Krugman predicted in August that the consequences of not extending the benefits were “terrifying” and would “push overall consumer spending . . . down by more than 4 percent.”<br />President Trump didn’t fully suspend bonus benefits—which would have been optimal for job growth—but he did cut them to $300 a week. Americans subsequently rushed to fill jobs and the unemployment rate fall rapidly. So much for economic ruin.</td>

      <td>An oversize, lavishly illustrated celebration of America’s favorite trading-card icons and the shrine created for them in Cooperstown, N.Y.</td>
      <td>A quotation often trotted out this time of year comes from Baseball Hall of Famer Rogers Hornsby, who played in his last game in 1937: “People ask me what I do in winter when there’s no baseball. I’ll tell you what I do. I stare out the window and wait for spring.”<br />This winter the virus will put everything baseball into serious doubt, including the ritual countdown to the day in February when pitchers and catchers are scheduled to report to spring training. For those who love the game and its past and have hope for its near- and long-term future, a good companion during this “off” off-season is “The National Baseball Hall of Fame Collection,” a slim, oversize, heavily illustrated book by James Buckley Jr. Turning its pages is akin to a stroll through the Hall of Fame itself. Mr. Buckley has given us a potent souvenir of that remarkable institution in Cooperstown, N.Y.<br />The Hall of Fame complex comprises the hall itself, a museum and the A. Bartlett Giamatti Research Center, which includes a library, an archive and a vast photo collection. The center, named after the baseball intellectual who in the late 1980s served as the game’s seventh commissioner, is a researcher’s dream come true. It can boast, among much else, of a dedicated file containing clippings and other biographical raw material for every major-league player who appeared in any game since 1871.<br />Between 1982 and 2012, I visited the Hall of Fame and Museum seven times. The most memorable visit was my first, in June 1982, when I did research for the first of 10 baseball-related books I would write over the next three decades. It was a thrill to see the place and enjoy the wonderful Frank Capra ambiance of the town in which it is located. It was during that first visit that the death of Satchel Paige, the first black pitcher to play in the American League, was announced. As befitted baseball’s equivalent of Westminster Abbey, the flags on the front plaza were lowered to half-staff and a large portrait of Paige, draped in black crepe, was displayed on an easel inside the main entrance.<br />Paige’s passing capped a movement for inclusion that had begun on July 25, 1966, when slugger Ted Williams was inducted into the Hall. When Williams took the podium, he was tanned and in great shape—one writer said he looked like Rock Hudson and sounded like John Wayne. After thanking a number of people and speaking on the virtue of hard work, he brought up the subject of Willie Mays, who had just hit his 522nd home run, which put him ahead of Williams. “He has gone past me, and he’s pushing, and I say to him, ‘Go get ’em, Willie.’ Baseball gives every American boy a chance to excel. Not just to be as good as someone else, but to be better than someone else. This is the nature of man and the name of the game.”</td>

      <td>‘Software is eating the world,” tech investor Marc Andreessenobserved in these pages in 2011. Now software is writing itself.<br />Mr. Andreessen’s point was that the commoditization and miniaturization of computer hardware was allowing software to run nearly everything. Since then, software has penetrated every aspect of life, from cameras to health care and even social interactions.<br />While software allowed hardware to be manufactured automatically, software itself continued to be built by hand. As a result, software development struggled to keep pace with demand. The cobbler’s children need shoes.<br />But software production is beginning to benefit from the automation that has driven the production of hardware. Artificial intelligence, a broad category of software that mimics human intelligence, is being applied to basic, repetitive and time-consuming tasks. Get ready for an explosion of software-written software.<br />The trend is triggering a complete makeover of the information-technology industry. Writing software quickly is a critical competitive market advantage in any industry. Established companies are being eaten alive by new competitors employing automated strategies to write software faster, shipping updates every day to deliver new capabilities to customers.

      <td>First-run movies may help overcome confusing strategy that has limited adoption of the stand-alone streaming service</td>
      <td>WarnerMedia might still need movie theaters. For now, though, it needs HBO Max even more.<br />The Hollywood titan owned by  AT&T  said Thursday that it will put the 17 theatrical movies it has slated for release next year on its HBO Max service in the U.S. the same day they are released for theaters. They will remain on the streaming platform for one month, after which the movies will play only in theaters “with all customary distribution windows” applying. This affects movies from the company’s Warner Bros. studio, including anticipated blockbusters such as “Dune,” “The Matrix 4” and “Godzilla vs. Kong.”<br />It is a bold move from a major Hollywood studio but a sensible one. The movie theater market in the U.S. remains severely hobbled by the pandemic. With less than a month to go in the year, the domestic box office for 2020 has totaled just over $2 billion compared with the $11 billion-plus level that has been the industry’s average over the previous five years, according to Box Office Mojo. Warner Bros. in particular has learned how tough the current market is. The company braved the pandemic’s waters with the Sept. 3 opening of “Tenet,” a $200 million psychological thriller that has so far grossed only $57.4 million domestically.<br />Even with potential vaccines on the horizon, sharply rising Covid-19 cases now make it unlikely that theater attendance will fully recover next year. That gives WarnerMedia an opportunity to give HBO Max a big boost. The company launched the streaming service in May—a seemingly perfect time to capture viewers stuck at home.<br />But HBO Max competes with the company’s other HBO offerings, including apps related to its long-running cable service. So while AT&T reported in its last earnings call in October that combined subscribers to HBO and HBO Max had hit 38 million domestically, that number includes only 8.6 million HBO Max activations. By contrast,  Netflix  now has about 73 million paid subscribers in the U.S. and Canada.</td>

He has attended meetings of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year in his capacity at the St. Louis Fed. He headed the University of Notre Dame’s economics department before joining the regional Fed bank in 2009.<br />Analysts said the largely party-line confirmation vote may have had less to do with specific objections to Mr. Waller’s qualifications, but showed Democrats’ broader frustrations with how the Trump administration has managed financial-policy and personnel issues during the lame-duck period. For example, the Treasury Department last month declined to renew emergency Fed lending facilities that will expire on Dec. 31.<br />Five of 12 Democrats had voted in July to advance Mr. Waller’s nomination out of the Senate Banking Committee, but he received no backing from Democrats on Thursday. One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, also opposed his confirmation.<br />The confirmation marked the first time the Senate had seated a governor in a lame-duck period that follows the November election before the president’s term ends in January, according to Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania.</td>

Mr. Russell will retain 83% of the voting power in Luminar and serve as its chairman.<br />Luminar “spent a huge amount of time just figuring out what was possible,” Mr. Russell said. “In some ways, it’s awesome and surreal to be a part of this, going public. In other ways, it just makes a lot of sense.”<br />The company makes lidar scanners, which use pulsed lasers to sense distances to nearby targets. In self-driving cars, the technology helps onboard computers create a picture of surrounding obstacles such as other cars and pedestrians in order to avoid collisions. The technology has notable critics—including Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk—but Luminar has said it sees its total addressable market growing from about $5 billion currently to $150 billion by 2030.<br />Luminar is another example of a company making its market debut after getting acquired by a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which are publicly traded shell companies formed to pursue deals.

      <td>In “Woke Capitalism in a Secular World” (Houses of Worship, Nov. 27), Andrew Abela says that success of a corporation “cannot be reduced solely to profitability.” And why not? Mr. Abela claims that corporations should be driven by “principles” derived from faith or “some other lasting, existential commitment” instead of the latest progressive causes. But the principles of faith, at least as understood in 2020 America, are subjective, subject to shifting social mores and the differing beliefs of individual corporate executives. Profitability has the benefit of being more objective while, as any student of Milton Friedman knows, providing the most social utility.<br />Anthony Kroger<br />Houston<br /><br />Mr. Abela laments the Business Roundtable’s redefined purpose of a corporation as having been hijacked by a woke movement that has companies becoming politically active. He suggests that companies should not be engaging in political activism, but instead should “work on the good that they were established to do.” But the more important point not mentioned is that companies and their CEOs are likely substituting these actions for the more substantive ones that the Business Roundtable recommended: “Rather than simply working in the interest of shareholders, the organization affirmed that companies also should commit to delivering value to customers, investing in employees, dealing fairly and ethically with suppliers, and supporting local communities.” The Business Roundtable’s principles were abandoned in the 1970s when American corporations embraced Milton Friedman’s pronouncement that businesses’ main purpose is to make as much money as possible for its shareholders. Had they not pursued Friedman’s policy, it is likely that we would not even be having a discussion of “woke capitalism” today.</td>

She accuses Kimberley Strassel of making a partisan attack on “any effort to improve our election system” (“Harvesting the 2020 Election,” Potomac Watch, Nov. 13). Ms. Morgan has made the classic error of conflating any attempt to criticize her pet bill with resisting any attempt at reform. She has the gall to criticize Ohio’s “purge” of its voter rolls. Shortly after voter rolls were updated there, Ohio voting patterns moved in a conservative direction. After the mess of this Nov. 3 election in Democratic-controlled states, I must conclude that the progressives’ desire to “count every vote” really means “count every vote that lands in a ballot box” regardless of its chain of custody or the legality of its arrival there. Ohio has done the right thing in cleaning up its voter rolls as an effective method of ensuring fair and honest elections for all its citizens.<br />Jim Cox<br />Xenia, Ohio<br /><br />Ms. Morgan responds to Ms. Strassel’s column on voter-integrity legislation proposal H.R. 1 by including the assertion that the bill would outlaw purging of voter rolls in any state of the names of those who have died or moved, including to another state. She states this as if that represents a prima facie improvement to election laws. If having a long-dead person’s name listed on active-voter rolls aides vote integrity, it certainly isn’t apparent why that is. If that condition helps potential cheaters, that appears obvious. Her assertion indicates a chasm in thought that leaves me baffled.</td>

Some of those members are now discussing tactics to elevate their preferred contenders, including possibly aligning their endorsements. They haven’t reached an agreement on their strategy, according to people familiar with the discussions, but one approach would be to choose one Black or Latino candidate to recommend for a handful of top remaining positions.<br />"The African-American and Latino communities rallied behind this administration and their expectations are to be included at all levels,” said Rep. Bennie Thompson (D, Miss.), who has spoken with the Biden transition team.<br />The efforts underscore the pressures Mr. Biden faces as he builds out his administration. In addition to demands that he increase the diversity across his cabinet nominees, Mr. Biden is navigating the party’s progressive base and his pledge to govern as a consensus builder. Some of the candidates being pushed by Black and Latino groups don’t have the backing of progressive groups, and vice versa.<br />Mr. Biden’s team so far has included a number of firsts for women and minorities. They include his choice of Alejandro Mayorkas, who is Cuban-American, to be the first Latino and first immigrant to lead the Department of Homeland Security, and Cecilia Rouse, who would be the first Black chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Biden named another Black woman, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, as his nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, and has appointed more than a dozen people of color to senior White House roles.</td>

The companies, which own mines in Illinois, Indiana, Montana and Wyoming, blamed the bankruptcy filings largely on low thermal coal prices and declining coal consumption at U.S. power plants.<br />The chapter 11 filings are the latest in a string of defaults by American coal companies, highlighting how a downturn in coal markets exacerbated by Covid-19 is straining an industry that was already in decline.<br />The U.S. power sector consumed 30% less coal in the first half of 2020 than during the same period last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The coal industry also has been facing competition from natural gas, a lower-cost fuel alternative, and the continuing retirement of coal-fired power plants.<br />Evansville, Ind.-based White Stallion said in court papers it is idling its mining operations and had terminated all of its roughly 260 employees just before filing for chapter 11, citing a severe cash crunch. Before filing for bankruptcy, White Stallion obtained a $10 million Covid-19 relief loan through the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program. The company is among hundreds of businesses that have gone into bankruptcy after obtaining a PPP loan.</td>

That includes the science-fiction adaptation “Dune,” a movie version of the musical “In The Heights” and a new installment of the “Matrix” franchise.<br />Warner Bros. last month said it was going to release “Wonder Woman 1984” on HBO Max Christmas Day for a month at the same time the movie went into theaters. The announcement Thursday covers 17 films that are scheduled for release next year.<br />“It’s threading a needle in the middle of a pandemic,” said Carolyn Blackwood, the studio’s chief operating officer. “We weren’t comfortable sitting on our hands or punting these movies into oblivion.”</td>

It claimed that the collection and counting of absentee ballots in two populous and heavily Democratic counties, Milwaukee and Dane, were marred by systemic violations of state election laws, and that around 220,000 of 3 million votes cast statewide should have been excluded from recount totals.<br />Thursday’s ruling follows a string of unsuccessful lawsuits elsewhere and comes after battleground states have certified results showing Mr. Biden won the election, leaving Mr. Trump with no known path to reversing the outcome in the courts. It also came as a Dec. 8 deadline approaches for states to finalize election results and choose electors ahead of a meeting of the Electoral College a week later.<br />Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday said the Justice Department hasn’t found evidence of widespread voter fraud that would alter the outcome of the election.</td>

      <td>Smaller celebrations still demand good wines. Scaled to suit this moment, half bottles offer other benefits, too. Here, our wine columnist’s top 5 smaller-format picks.</td>
      <td>ARE YOU an optimist or a pessimist by nature? Your feelings about wine in half bottles might offer a clue. Some consider half-bottles a disappointment: They hold only half as much wine. Others see a low-risk means of trying something new. After tasting a trove of wines in tinyish bottles, I think I fall somewhere in between the two types.<br />Half bottles are a conundrum. They offer oenophiles the opportunity to try a wine for much less money—even if, often, half bottles cost more than half the full-bottle price. They can give a preview of a vintage, since wine in half bottles ages more rapidly. (The amount of air trapped between cork and wine is the same in both sizes, so the ratio of air to wine is higher in a half bottle.) This makes half bottles more readily drinkable but less valuable, too, since ageability is a hallmark of a collectible wine.<br />Still, half bottles might be the right size right now. People are drinking alone thanks to pandemic-related restrictions on gathering at restaurants or bars, or at home with friends. And during the holidays, this size suits smaller groups of celebrants too.<br />Retail sales figures released by Nielsen last month show that retail sales of wine in half bottles were up 45.5% in the 4-week period ending Nov. 7 over the same period last year. Full-size bottles saw a 19% increase in the same time period.<br />More people are buying half bottles, but until I went out hunting bottles for this column, I was not among them. If I really like a wine, I’ll always opt for the full-size alternative. And the choice of wines in half bottles tends to be much more limited; many producers don’t make half bottles at all.</td>

      <td>The screen adaptation of the recent Broadway musical has a full dance floor of star power but is far from a night to remember.</td>
      <td>Seldom does a show-stopper also serve as a show-starter. That’s what happens in “The Prom,” but it’s no cause for celebration, even though this Netflix version of the recent Broadway musical has been equipped with an exceptional cast that includes Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman and James Corden. For much of its 130-minute running time the production, directed by Ryan Murphy, suffers from excessive self-delight, chronic glee and a surfeit of joyishness, along with splotches of sentimentality, and doesn’t start to come alive with unforced energy until one of its stars launches into a song-and-dance number that lasts for four truly delightful minutes.<br />The main action begins with an open-and-shut case on Broadway. A couple of aging stage stars, Ms. Streep’s Dee Dee Allen and Mr. Corden’s Barry Glickman, open in “Eleanor!”—a would-be rollicking musical about Eleanor Roosevelt. The reviews are so brutal that the show closes the same night, with the most withering critical scorn directed at the actors themselves—not for choosing a ludicrous vehicle but for being insufferable narcissists.<br />How, then, can they revive their careers? By becoming celebrity activists, they decide in a flash, and finding a cause to champion. Their vague notion quickly turns specific when Dee Dee and Barry learn that the head of the high school PTA in a small Indiana town has forbidden a student from bringing her girlfriend to the senior prom. Mission identified. The fallen stars will journey to the American heartland with two other friends whose careers are on the rocks—Angie Dickinson, not the actress but a dancer played by Ms. Kidman, and a Juilliard-trained thespian, Trent Oliver (Andrew Rannells)—and they’ll support the beleaguered girl with all the well-publicized selflessness they can muster.<br />The premise is a good one because it sets up a collision between the smug Broadway liberals and the resolutely conservative locals, with the earnest lesbian student caught in the crossfire. (Her name is Emma Nolan and she’s played appealingly by Jo Ellen Pellman. Ariana DeBose is Emma’s closeted girlfriend, Alyssa Greene. Alyssa’s mother, the PTA lady, is played by Kerry Washington.) But there are challenges as well, starting with the need for a sharp but generous take on the actors’ vanity and condescension. I didn’t see the well-received Broadway show, but I have the word of my colleague Terry Teachout who, in his review, wrote that Dee Dee, Barry and the others were “drawn with wicked exactitude.”<br />Many words could be used to describe the movie’s approach, but exactitude isn’t among them. Untethered exuberance comes closer. The stars are obviously having great fun in their roles, and we’re up for sharing it: Who doesn’t want to see a cast like this succeed? Yet the characters and situations are oversold from the opening scenes, and it’s not a problem of technique—these virtuosos can do anything that’s asked of them—but of directorial choice in a movie that still has one foot on a theater stage. The performances are many sizes too big for the camera, notwithstanding Matthew Libatique’s elegant lighting and cinematography.</td>

      <td>Bryan Cranston stars in a Showtime series about a New Orleans judge whose son is the culprit in a hit-and-run that kills the child of a vicious mobster.</td>
      <td>By episode 3 of “Your Honor,” Bryan Cranston’s beleaguered Judge Michael Desiato is sitting in a New Orleans dive, drinking whiskey and listening to Leonard Cohen—worse, discussing Leonard Cohen with the only other barfly in the place. Do we feel sorry for him? One of the distinguishing characteristics of “Your Honor” is how little sympathy we’re meant to feel for anyone, other than the dead being left behind.<br />Motives, miscues and the best intentions gone horribly awry provide the dramatic momentum of this 10-part thriller, created by the U.K.’s Peter Moffat, whose characters here are all morally amorphous entities doing what they think is best and making up for it later. Everyone is calculating his or her next move; nothing is casual. The reason Michael goes to that New Orleans bar at all is in pursuit of the questionable objective he’s had all along: preventing his son, Adam (Hunter Doohan), from being revealed as the culprit in a horrific hit-and-run that claimed the life of a young motorcyclist named Rocco (Benjamin Hassan Wadsworth).<br />Michael knows that he and Adam should go to the police. But before they can, he realizes who the dead kid was—the child of Jimmy and Gina Baxter (Michael Stuhlbarg and Hope Davis), vicious mobsters with tentacles everywhere in the city’s underworld. The judge knows what will happen if the facts come out. He has to save his son. So he constructs a wobbly tower of lies and misdirection that threatens to crush the lives—professional, political and otherwise—of everyone he knows.<br />“Your Honor” is complicated, but good complicated: The impulses of the players are understandable. And even though the means are ruthless and the ends seemingly inevitable, one can still be startled by how things play out. The introductory calamity itself, foreshadowed luxuriously by director Edward Berger (who handles several episodes), is a stomach-churning convergence of bad luck, bad timing and vehicular malpractice: On the anniversary of his mother’s murder, the unsettled Adam is en route to the cemetery when he has an asthma attack, drops his inhaler, tries to retrieve it and collides with Rocco—who goes tumbling across an empty intersection. Adam stops. Rocco expires. Adam panics. Adam flees.<br />Without giving much away, not that I can (only four episodes were available for review), Michael looks at the situation and his son’s pathetic attempts to cover his tracks and asks his old pal, local congressman Charlie Figaro (a terrific Isiah Whitlock Jr.), to make the damaged car disappear. Charlie, who’s about to run for mayor, can make such things happen, and Michael tells him only that the car holds bad memories—it belonged to his wife. Charlie arranges for a street-gang-allied kid, Kofi Jones (Lamar Johnson), to steal the car; Michael, trying to create a plausible timeline for Adam, tells a detective friend, Nancy Costello (Amy Landecker), that the car was stolen the day of the accident. Everyone is so uncannily efficient at what they do that Kofi is arrested before the day is out, a motorcycle part falls from the car’s undercarriage, and the boy is hung out to dry. All this by the end of episode 2.</td>

      <td>Mads Mikkelsen stars in a Danish comedy about a group of friends who try to better their lives by tweaking their blood-alcohol levels.</td>
      <td>‘Another Round” is the bland English title of a brilliant Danish comedy originally called “Druk.” That means drink, or drinking, and it goes more directly to the essence of a story about four friends, all of them middle-aged high-school teachers, who transform their lives with alcohol consumed in the course of a cockeyed pseudo-scientific experiment. Yet drink, drinking or binge-drinking—there’s some of that too—can’t begin to convey the wild beauty and emotional depth of this film, which stars the great Mads Mikkelsen and was directed by Thomas Vinterberg from a script he wrote with his longtime collaborator Tobias Lindholm. It’s also the first feature, as far as I know, to display its characters’ real-time blood alcohol levels on screen.<br />Mr. Mikkelsen is Martin, a history teacher at a laid-back private school. The bright-faced seniors in his class are perfectly open to the proposition of learning about the past, but Martin is chronically unfocused in the present and his students are on to him—so much so that one young man stands up and walks out of the classroom in disgust. (Playing now in virtual theaters, the film goes to digital platforms on December 18.)<br />If you’re a James Bond fan you may remember Mr. Mikkelsen from his role as Le Chiffre, the villainous banker who bleeds from one eye in the 2006 “Casino Royale.” If you’re a devotee of superb acting you’ll remember him from the 2013 “The Hunt,” another Vinterberg-Lindholm collaboration, in which he plays a blameless kindergarten teacher accused of serial child-molestation. Denmark is a small country, but Mr. Mikkelsen looms large among the leading screen actors of our time. His wit is quick, his timing impeccable, and his characters always seem to have a rich inner life; he has a gift for suggesting who they were before they got to be who they are.<br />The Martin we see at the beginning of the film isn’t a drinker. He’s depressed and lost in lassitude—not quite a full-time tenant of his body. Yet we sense that he must have been formidably charming as a younger man, and that’s before we’re told by one of the friends in his group that he had been the best of them, a gifted scholar with a promising career.<br />The friend who conveys this information, an amiable psychology teacher named Nikolaj (Magnus Millang), is the one who proposes the drinking experiment in the course of a party the others have organized for his 40th birthday. The experiment, the teacher says, is based on the work of the Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skårderud, who has famously argued—this part is fact, not fiction—that humans are born with a blood alcohol deficit of 0.05%.</td>

      <td>Arkansas’s TheatreSquared offers a well-performed webcast of a play about the Nobel laureate’s persecution by the French press for her relationship with a married man.</td>
      <td>In spite of all the theater-related traveling I did in the years before the pandemic struck, there are still plenty of drama companies of consequence that I have yet to see. I’ve been hearing good things about Arkansas’s TheatreSquared for some time now, and it was long my plan to see a play there after paying a visit to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, which is just 30 miles away and which I also have yet to see. But life kept getting in the way, and the coming of Covid-19 finished the job: I haven’t seen a play in a theater, in or out of New York, since March. So when TheatreSquared announced that it would be webcasting a production of Lauren Gunderson’s “The Half-Life of Marie Curie” taped in an empty theater, I immediately put it on my schedule.<br />Ms. Gunderson’s work is rarely staged in New York, but she was the most frequently produced playwright in America (not counting Shakespeare) in 2017 and 2019, and it’s easy to see why. Not only does she specialize in feminist-angled plots whose protagonists are women, but she makes a special point of writing eminently practical plays that are carefully tailored to the specific needs of theater companies. Like all prolific artists, Ms. Gunderson’s work is uneven—she can be earnest to a fault when she has a political point to make—but at her best, she is a fine craftsman whose shows are always solidly made and on occasion inspired.<br />“The Half-Life of Marie Curie,” a two-hander first performed off Broadway in 2019, falls somewhere in between the extremes of over-earnestness and inspiration. It’s a bioplay that tells how Mme. Curie (Rebecca Harris)—the Polish-French physicist who discovered radium, coined the word “radioactive” and won two Nobel Prizes, in 1903 and 1911—was persecuted by France’s press when it became known that she was having a passionate affair with a married man. Hertha Ayrton (Leontyne Mbele-Mbong), a British colleague and part-time suffragette, comes to France to look after her old friend as the action gets under way. Alas, much of the dialogue that ensues amounts to little more than undramatized pulpit-pounding and ill-digested biographical data (“I’m sorry—you won another Nobel Prize?”) with a few glaring anachronisms thrown in for good measure (I cannot imagine that a Brit with so well-bred an accent would have used the word “bullshit” in casual conversation in 1911). Nevertheless, the situation portrayed by Ms. Gunderson has the advantage of being inherently dramatic, and “The Half-Life of Marie Curie” is the kind of story that can easily take wing so long as the two actors are first-rate.<br />This brings us to Ms. Harris and Ms. Mbele-Mbong, both of whom (as theater people like to say) really know how to deliver the mail. Not only does Ms. Harris bear a striking resemblance to Mme. Curie, but her binational accent is impeccable and her performance is both compelling and entirely believable. So fully does she embody her role that it hardly seems as if she’s acting at all. (Newsreel footage of Mme. Curie exists, and I’d be surprised if Ms. Harris hadn’t screened it while preparing for this show.)<br />Ms. Mbele-Mbong is no less convincing, and the production, whose skeletal sets are by Ashleigh Burns and whose sound design is by Michael Prieto, is spare but exceedingly handsome. Dawn Monique Williams, the director, is the associate artistic director of Berkeley’s Aurora Theatre Company. Her work is new to me, but if this beautifully staged show is representative, then I’ll definitely seek it out in the future.</td>

      <td>Set in a pre-pandemic Toronto hospital, NBC’s series features an appealing cast and a healthy dose of hospital-drama clichés.</td>
      <td>Nurses deserve a show called “Nurses,” especially right now. Whether they deserve this particular “Nurses” is another story. Still, one can imagine an exhausted health-care worker coming home, grabbing a bite and curling up with the beautiful, beleaguered characters who populate the show’s Canadian hospital, where the pre-pandemic, single-payer problems will seem like so many common colds. Can you drift off to sleep while rolling your eyes?<br />Like NBC’s “Transplant,” another imported hit from up north, “Nurses” begins in normal times, in a normally chaotic Toronto hospital called St. Mary’s, where a diverse quintet of nurses arrives for its first day on the job. In a nod to tradition, the de-facto lead character is the blond, blue-eyed member of the group, Grace Knight (Tiera Skovbye), who also has the most ornate story: She was fired from her last job, under circumstances she’d rather not discuss, and is romantically involved with man who already has a fiancée. It will require further examination, but it appears the lover is involved in an arranged marriage-to-be, perhaps of the Indian variety.<br />Also Indian is Nazneen “Naz” Khan (Sandy Sidhu), daughter of a Bollywood star, who has never had a job before and yet has somehow landed in a prestigious facility where her shortcomings begin with not knowing how to make a bed. The pampered Naz is trying to get herself into the real working world, but she’s a natural target for the older, hardened staffers who’ve seen it all, and done it all, and quite obviously resent her for the way she makes her scrubs look like they came from Lululemon.<br />The others principals are the young, naïve nurse-with-a-secret Wolf Burke (Donald MacLean Jr.); former college football star Keon Colby (Jordan Johnson-Hinds); and the somewhat abrasive Ashley Collins (Natasha Calis), who when a white supremacist neo-Nazi comes under their care—after he’s driven into a crowd of pedestrians and filled the emergency room—seriously considers not treating him at all. “I wouldn’t be topping off his morphine drip,” she mutters. This is emotionally satisfying in the moment, but it does call into question the crew’s understanding of medical ethics.<br />The young, intrepid health professionals are all likable and played by very watchable actors who are saddled with dialogue that echoes hospital shows of every era. They’re also characters of somewhat amorphous definition—the doctors treat them like medical waste, yet they’re often smarter than the doctors and willing to contradict them or bail them out in the event of a misdiagnosis. Or nondiagnosis. The more experienced Grace bails out a young surgeon who freezes up in the operating room. In another case, she correctly guesses that meningitis is behind an ER patient’s wildly erratic behavior, which is initially written off to drug abuse or mental illness. Would we have drawn the same conclusion if he were white, she asks? Well, the guy was acting crazier than a rat in a can, so most viewers will be guessing yes, while appreciating the show’s interest in championing oppressed minorities, the most prominent of which is the nursing class itself.</td>

      <td>The Trump administration has sued  Facebook Inc.,  accusing the social-media company of illegally reserving high-paying jobs for immigrant workers it was sponsoring for permanent residence, rather than searching adequately for available U.S. workers who could fill the positions.<br />In a 17-page complaint filed Thursday, the Justice Department’s civil-rights division said Facebook inadequately advertised at least 2,600 positions between 2018 and 2019 that were filled by immigrants on H-1B high-skill visas when the company was applying to sponsor those workers for permanent residency, known as green cards.<br />Companies sponsoring workers for employment-based green cards are required to show as part of the federal application process that they couldn’t find any qualified American workers to fill the job.<br />The suit said Facebook didn’t advertise the reserved positions on its website and required candidates to mail in their applications rather than accepting them online.<br />“And even when U.S. workers do apply, Facebook will not consider them for the advertised positions,” the suit alleges. “Simply put, Facebook reserves these positions for temporary visa holders.”</td>

      <td>AMC  Entertainment Holdings Inc., the world’s largest movie theater chain, has launched efforts to sell more than $700 million worth of stock while warning that failing to raise enough liquidity might force the company into bankruptcy.<br />The equity sale could help AMC avoid a debt default, if the company can generate enough dollars to last it until widespread vaccination against Covid-19 helps bring moviegoers back into theaters, AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron said in an interview Thursday.<br />If AMC can’t obtain the liquidity needed to stay afloat until movie attendance gets back to normal, the company would likely need to restructure its balance sheet, potentially causing a “total loss” of stockholders’ investment, according to a securities filing Thursday. Equity ranks below debt in priority and often gets wiped out in a bankruptcy restructuring.<br />AMC is aiming to sell up to 200 million shares, or more than $700 million, based on the $3.58 stock price Thursday afternoon. The company previously proposed stock sales in September and November, filing two separate shelf registrations to sell 30 million and 20 million shares, respectively.<br />Despite reopening the bulk of the company’s more than 1,000 cinemas world-wide, AMC is burning cash as capacity restrictions limit movie attendance and major Hollywood theaters delay big-ticket flicks or, increasingly, send them straight to streaming.  AT&T Inc.’s  Warner Bros. studio pushed back the release of “Wonder Woman 1984” until Christmas, while MGM Holdings Inc. has delayed the release of “No Time to Die,” a James Bond film, to April 2021.</td>

      <td>A romance blossoms between an English fossil hunter and her unexpected guest in this film starring Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan.</td>
      <td>Instead of getting blood from stones, Mary Anning, the English paleontologist played by Kate Winslet in “Ammonite,” gets fossils, insights and wisdom. And behind the heroine’s stony visage lurks ardor that’s unfulfilled until another woman comes into her life. Francis Lee’s film, which co-stars Saoirse Ronan, is many things, all of them remarkable: a queer romance that finds passion in austerity; a biopic that strips away most details of Anning’s career while honoring its spirit; and a portrait of genius thwarted by gender—a scientist whose lonely existence is sustained by love of learning, even though, as a woman in the mid-19th century, she has achieved only a small fraction of the recognition, let alone fame, that she deserves. (The film, which has been playing in select theaters, is newly available on premium video on demand.)<br />The title derives from Mary’s work, cracking open ancient rocks to see what’s inside. She is far from ancient herself—Ms. Winslet gives her an outwardly calm beauty born of physical strength—but she could hardly be more closed off when we first meet her. An angry eccentric within sight of middle age, she is living with her elderly mother in a coastal town in West Dorset and supporting herself with a little shop where she sells tourists fossils of no scientific interest that she has found in the nearby cliffs. (She has already made a spectacular discovery, an ichthyosaur skeleton that is displayed in the British Museum, but her name on the label has been replaced by that of the man who purchased the fossil and donated it.)<br />Mary’s life changes when a young married couple show up at her shop. The husband, Roderick Murchison, is a geologist at the beginning of a European tour; he knows of Mary by reputation and declares his pleasure in meeting her. The wife, Charlotte, played exquisitely by Ms. Ronan, would have a classic pre-Raphaelite radiance if she weren’t suffering from what her husband calls mild melancholia and seems to be serious depression provoked by a miscarriage. Whatever the case, a fairly abrupt plot turn sends Roderick off on his tour while Charlotte remains behind to convalesce in Mary’s care.<br />That may suggest prompt bonding and a rapid thawing of Mary’s demeanor, but the opposite is true. In keeping with the spareness of the film as a whole, Mary’s bewilderment at her attraction to Charlotte gives way only gradually to her awakening. Their love starts as a mother-child relationship. When it finally opens out into physical rapture there’s still an anguishing realization on Mary’s part that Charlotte, once recovered, will go back to her husband in London, and to whatever world she can make for herself. Or will she? If there’s any fault to be found with “Ammonite,” it’s in the film’s deliberateness. Every step of the way is plotted with a clear purpose, and color-coded in Stéphane Fontaine’s cinematography, which is oppressively bleak until it warms and brightens in keeping with Mary’s evolution. Yet the ending isn’t clear at all. It’s a marvelous moment in which the only clarity comes from knowing that whatever may happen next, Mary will remain her own singular woman.<br />Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—House Democrats selected New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney to lead the caucus through its next campaign cycle, choosing a chairman who represents the types of districts the party will need to win to expand its narrow majority.<br />Mr. Maloney won the race on Thursday, beating California Rep. Tony Cárdenas to chair the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee, which oversees the strategy for the party’s House elections.<br />The vote total was 119 for Mr. Maloney and 107 for Mr. Cárdenas.<br />The soon-to-be five-term lawmaker campaigned on courting voters whom the party failed to reach in the 2020 cycle, including more conservative voters, saying he was aptly positioned to do so because he represents a district that President Trump won in 2016. He also plans to appoint people to look at Latino outreach and recruiting women to run for office.<br />Mr. Maloney has analyzed the party’s losses before. When Democrats were shocked at Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016 and other party losses that year, Mr. Maloney analyzed the DCCC’s operations. He said that helped the party win the House majority two years later.</td>

      <td>Furloughs would be a first for Southwest as airlines continue to grapple with the pandemic</td>
      <td>Southwest Airlines Co.  on Thursday told more than 6,800 employees that their jobs are at risk without concessions from labor unions or more federal aid as the coronavirus pandemic continues to decimate demand for air travel.<br />The temporary layoffs, if the company goes through with them, would be a first for Southwest, which has never furloughed or laid off employees in its 53-year history. The airline had pledged to avoid those measures this year. But in October the company told unions that the company would need them to agree to the equivalent of a 10% pay reduction to offset overstaffing costs. Without that, the company said, job losses in 2021 would be inevitable.<br />Russell McCrady, Southwest’s vice president of labor relations, said the notices were necessary as negotiations with unions have stalled, but added that the company would be willing to pick talks up again. “Our absolute goal is to preserve every job at Southwest Airlines,” he said in a statement Thursday.<br />Leaders of unions that represent Southwest’s pilots and flight attendants said they believed the notices were meant to pressure employees. “We see it as a heartless and cutthroat negotiating tactic,” said Jon Weaks, president of the union that represents Southwest’s pilots.<br />Rival carriers have furloughed tens of thousands of workers as the industry continues to bleed cash and executives believe it will take years for travel demand to return to the same levels as before the pandemic.</td>

For much of the labor force, the idea of checking off goals set during the comparatively rosy close of 2019 now seems quaint. Many markets have shifted dramatically, teams have been redeployed, and workers are often doing the jobs of departed colleagues in addition to trying on the role of teacher or caregiver for a chunk of the workday.<br />In response, some companies are scrapping parts of their performance-management systems, like mid-year reviews and numeric ratings. Others are lowering sales quotas and instituting a sort of performance-score inflation, urging bosses to avoid doling out that dreaded “does not meet expectations” label.<br />It’s all part of a pandemic-driven management style called empathetic leadership. To be sure, some bosses remain unmoved, expecting things to march on as if nothing has changed. But many say these days they are recognizing—and evaluating—the employee as a whole person and not just a worker bee.<br /></td>

      <td>Faced with Christmas in quarantine, far-flung families are finding ways that their smartphones, tablets and other tech can help them maintain traditions</td>
      <td>BEING HOME for the holidays is bound to feel different this year: Nearly 75% of Americans plan to do their best to celebrate with family and friends virtually according to a recent OnePoll survey conducted for Asurion Home+—with 93% of respondents blaming Covid-19.<br />But even if you spend the holiday season alone, you needn’t feel lonely. The dumpster fire that is 2020 has yielded at least one upside: The widespread adoption of social tech has made everyone more-or-less comfortable with shared digital experiences, from work meetings to big family meals and, implausibly, weddings.<br />Virtual communing is no longer limited to Zoom calls with relatives who can’t quite master unmuting: New app features offer an interactive e-gathering experience, which can be more meaningful than lifeless video chats said Jeremy Birnholtz, director of the Social Media Lab and associate professor of communication studies at Northwestern University. “Assuming you’re going to get the exact feelings out of online interactions as an in-person one isn’t realistic. But online interactions can help preserve relationships.”<br />Bradley Keys, a Santa Monica, Calif., marketing director, was worried that his annual Christmas Eve viewing of “The Polar Express” with family and friends would be ruined by the pandemic. Then he found a way for them to join his celebration from wherever they happened to be holed up: “This year, we’ll be using the Rave to watch together from a distance,” he said. The Rave app lets users sync up their  Netflix ,   Amazon  Prime and YouTube screenings and text or voice chat during the show.<br />To take his family’s annual Yuletide game nights virtual, Tal Shelef, co-founder of a real-estate listing site in Toronto, turned to the Houseparty app. “We’ve celebrated Game Night as a family tradition since I was a kid,” he said. “It keeps family gatherings exciting, diffuses tensions and helps everyone relax.” Houseparty lets up to eight people per “room” share face-to-face video as they play.

Some of the claims grew out of a sweeping corruption scandal in Brazil that focused on bribery of officials at state-controlled  Petróleo Brasileiro SA,  also known as Petrobras.<br />The deal includes a deferred-prosecution agreement that allows Vitol to escape charges if it stays out of trouble for three years. The company will also pay an additional $45 million in a coordinated settlement with Brazilian authorities, according to U.S. prosecutors.<br />The investigation of Vitol, accused of paying millions in bribes over a decade, also involved the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The fine paid to the CFTC, a civil regulatory agency, wasn’t disclosed at Thursday’s court hearing.<br />Vitol, a private company, trades 8 million barrels a day of crude oil and also manages upstream assets and refineries, according to its website. Other companies that have faced similar investigations include Glencore PLC and Singapore-based Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd.</td>

But it wasn’t until Covid-19 sent millions of people home to work remotely that Salesforce came to terms with the app maker—agreeing to pay more than 50% above Slack’s closing price the day before The Wall Street Journal broke news of the talks.<br />Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Bret Taylor, one of the architects of the $27.7 billion deal, including cash and debt, said that how its customers and the wider business world reacted to the health crisis, by more rapidly adopting digital tools, drove the two companies together.<br />“The technology that Slack made felt more relevant than ever before. That really motivated us to get into these discussions now,” Mr. Taylor said in an interview.<br />The deal will transform Salesforce into one of the largest players in business software, and, analysts say, help turn it into a more formidable opponent against  Microsoft Corp. , which has been pushing its Teams software suite—which includes Slack-like functions—as a new operating system for companies.</td>

      <td>Earlier this year, consumable goods like food were what was driving sales growth at dollar stores. Now these discount retailers are raising their sights to higher-margin items such as party goods and home accessories.<br />Take  Dollar General ,  which said Thursday that net sales rose 17% and net income expanded 57% in the quarter ended Oct. 30 from a year earlier. Home products sold particularly well. That has helped boost Dollar General’s gross margins, which have been expanding for six consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. On an earnings call, Chief Executive Todd Vasos said it was the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in non-consumables sales.<br />The greater profitability of these items makes for a strong draw. Rival  Dollar Tree  has two brands, its namesake brand, which sells discretionary items for a dollar each, and Family Dollar, which is more like Dollar General in selling a mix of goods at value prices. The former’s gross margins came in at 34.9% in its latest quarter, while the latter’s were 26.8%. Dollar General’s gross margin is somewhere in between, at 31.3%.<br />Dollar General had already started introducing more discretionary goods through an initiative it started last year to add more assortment. It is really leaning in now with a new store concept, Popshelf, carrying discretionary items under $5. The discounter is betting that the treasure-hunt experience will appeal to a suburban audience of higher-income customers. It has opened two new stores near Nashville, which have performed better than the company’s expectations. Dollar General plans to have 30 Popshelf stores by the end of 2021.<br />Dollar Tree, too, said in its most recent earnings call that it will roll out 500 higher-priced stores—with goods priced between a dollar and $5—beginning next spring.</td>

They know he could fixate on his complaints that the election was rigged, even though Georgia has certified President-elect Joe Biden as the winner of the state’s 16 electoral votes. No evidence of widespread voter fraud, in Georgia or elsewhere, has emerged.<br />But they remain hopeful that Mr. Trump will deliver the agreed-upon message: Republicans must vote, so they can keep both senators in office and ensure a Republican Senate majority that can protect the president’s accomplishments.<br />“I’m not sure what he’s going to say,” one Trump adviser said. “He’s super pissed.”</td>

On Thursday, European low-cost leader  Ryanair  confirmed that it would exercise the option to buy a further 75 units, on top of 135 previously ordered.<br />Shares in the Chicago-based plane maker, which has estimated the cost of the MAX debacle at around $20 billion, rose almost 8%. To meet scheduled production rates, the company needs to ship out the 450 MAX planes it has in storage, about 100 of which no longer have a prospective buyer and need to be remarketed.<br />Yet it shouldn’t be a surprise that the plane is selling again.<br />Because aircraft aren’t consumer products, even the biggest scandals are unlikely to push a model out of the market. The infamous McDonnell Douglas DC-10 carried passengers for decades after being grounded. Airlines facing any customer backlash could probably get away with subtle rebranding in fuselages and onboard safety cards. Ryanair labels its custom high-capacity MAX the “737-8200.”</td>

      <td>As Director of National Intelligence, I am entrusted with access to more intelligence than any member of the U.S. government other than the president. I oversee the intelligence agencies, and my office produces the President’s Daily Brief detailing the threats facing the country. If I could communicate one thing to the American people from this unique vantage point, it is that the People’s Republic of China poses the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War II.<br />The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the U.S. and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically. Many of China’s major public initiatives and prominent companies offer only a layer of camouflage to the activities of the Chinese Communist Party.<br />I call its approach of economic espionage “rob, replicate and replace.” China robs U.S. companies of their intellectual property, replicates the technology, and then replaces the U.S. firms in the global marketplace.<br />Take Sinovel. In 2018 a federal jury found the Chinese wind-turbine manufacturer guilty of stealing trade secrets from  American Superconductor .  Penalties were imposed but the damage was done. The theft resulted in the U.S. company losing more than $1 billion in shareholder value and cutting 700 jobs. Today Sinovel sells wind turbines world-wide as if it built a legitimate business through ingenuity and hard work rather than theft.<br />The FBI frequently arrests Chinese nationals for stealing research-and-development secrets. Until the head of Harvard’s Chemistry Department was arrested earlier this year, China was allegedly paying him $50,000 a month as part of a plan to attract top scientists and reward them for stealing information. The professor has pleaded not guilty to making false statements to U.S. authorities. Three scientists were ousted in 2019 from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston over concerns about China’s theft of cancer research. The U.S. government estimates that China’s intellectual-property theft costs America as much as $500 billion a year, or between $4,000 and $6,000 per U.S. household.</td>

Snowflake’s share price jumped 15% Thursday. Investors remain enthralled with the long-term potential for the company’ services, which help businesses rapidly analyze information faster than traditional database tools can.

      <td>How does an unstable nucleus ‘know’ when it’s time to decay? The answer may lie in the fabric of space itself.</td>
      <td>Nobel Prize-winning physicist Frank Wilczek explores the secrets of the cosmos. Read previous columns here.<br />In 1935, the physicist Erwin Schrödinger invented a thought-experiment to test whether quantum theory fully describes reality. Known as “Schrödinger’s Cat,” the experiment asks us to imagine a cat in a sealed box, together with a vial containing poisonous gas and a mechanism that can shatter the vial. The mechanism is triggered when an unstable atomic nucleus decays, breaking the glass and killing the cat.<br />According to quantum theory, however, the nucleus can be in different states, unchanged or decayed, at the same time. Only when it is observed do the possible states “collapse,” making it definite whether the nucleus has decayed or not. Thus the poor cat somehow hovers between life and death, waiting for somebody or something to collapse the nucleus’s state (and thus its own). This weird situation suggested to Schrödinger that quantum theory is missing something. With all respect to him, however, I think that the weird part of the setup isn’t the cat; it’s the behavior of the unstable nucleus.<br />To see why, consider radioactive dating, a marvelous technique for determining the age of objects. It is used in archaeology, to date human artifacts; in geology, to date stones and strata; and in astrophysics, to date distant stars and gas clouds. The accuracy of radioactive dating is undisputed, yet the principle behind it is deeply strange.<br />Many objects contain some nuclei that are unstable, meaning that they will eventually decay, changing into a different isotope and emitting energy in the process. In every equal interval of time, a fixed proportion of the unstable nuclei in a sample will decay. The amount of time it takes for half of them to decay is known as the isotope’s half-life.</td>

      <td>Legislation differs from House version, leaving prospects of new law unclear</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Senate unanimously passed a bill late Wednesday aimed at clearing a backlog of green cards for primarily Indian immigrants, after more than a year of wrangling following House passage of a similar bill in 2019.<br />The bill lifts caps on the number of permanent-residency permits, commonly known as green cards, awarded to immigrants from any one country who come to the U.S. with job offers. That would allow people who have waited in the backlog the longest—primarily Indian immigrants on H-1B high-skill visas—to receive green cards first under a revamped system.<br />The bill was approved under a procedure known as unanimous consent, which allows legislation with no opposition to pass without moving through the normal process of roll-call votes and hearings. Considerable differences exist between the Senate and House bills, and the short window for consolidating them in the current session of Congress clouds the prospect of a law taking effect soon.<br />Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), the bill’s sponsor, has attempted to bring up the country-caps bill on four previous occasions in the last year-and-a-half, though each time a different senator objected, forcing Mr. Lee to alter the bill to meet specific demands. As a result, the bill that passed contains a small carve-out intended for nurses from the Philippines—a key demand from hospital groups backed by Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.)—and provisions imposing restrictions on companies that employ half their workers on H-1B visas.<br />The most recent objection came from Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.), who inserted two measures backed by the White House. The first would impose a new cap of sorts for the next decade on the overall number of immigrants on H-1B visas who can receive green cards. The second could severely restrict future immigration from China.</td>

The agency said the meat can be sold in Singapore as an ingredient in Eat Just’s nuggets product.<br />Eat Just said the approval followed two years of discussion and review. It opens the way for the first commercial sales of such cell-cultured meat, which uses self-replicating animal cells to grow muscle tissue that can be harvested as meat.<br />Developers have said the technology still is in its infancy, and producing meat in bioreactor tanks from animal cells remains far more expensive than raising and slaughtering chickens, cattle and hogs. The technology has drawn investments from major meatpackers like Cargill Inc. and  Tyson Foods Inc.,  as well as such investors as Bill Gates and Richard Branson.<br />Proponents say the method can ease the environmental impact of producing meat for a growing world population, though farmers and ranchers have been skeptical of consumers’ appetite for hamburgers and chicken breasts developed in laboratories.</td>

After her family Thanksgiving was canceled, Ms. Finnegan, 37, a chief customer-experience officer for RiteAid in Los Angeles, will spend the holiday with her parents on Long Island after quarantining. “I see us making a bigger deal out of it than usual,” she said. “Everything’s riding on those two days—you want to make it more fun.” Same goes for her holiday wardrobe. “I’m excited to get something new and to feel special.” She’s open to both tartan and glitter.<br />With Covid cases spiking, the holidays barely resemble themselves—goodbye family trips and awkward office parties, hello outdoor dinners and equally awkward Zooms. What does that mean for jolly dressing? Some women, like Ms. Finnegan, are compensating for months spent in athleisure by decking themselves out. Others, like 33-year-old Julie Webman, are forgoing the fuss. “I’m not dressing up. Comfort is leading my decision-making process,” said Ms. Webman, an activewear merchant in New York. For Hanukkah video calls, she’ll rely on cashmere joggers, a sweater and minor concessions to merriment. “I’m going to put on hoops and blow-dry my hair. But I’m not putting on shoes.”<br />Caroline Maguire, fashion director of e-commerce site Shopbop, advises Zoomers to elevate an at-home look with an idiosyncratic sweater—like the knit at right. “We can’t keep them in stock,” she said of the site’s intarsia and Fair Isle options. If that feels like a generic gesture toward cheer, she suggests layers of necklaces.<br />Celebrating outdoors? “I would do a bright-colored puffer jacket,” said Ikram Goldman, co-founder of Chicago boutique Ikram. “And there’s no question that you should be in a funny hat.” While we do have a few questions (just how funny?), we’ll concede that quirky accessories help fuel dinner chat. For defiantly festive cocooning, Ms. Goldman specifies “dresses with a lot of detail,” like the knot-embellished satin Rabih Kayrouz style she’s planning to wear indoors. Another contender: the bowed Khaite number at right.<br />While spending Christmas Eve at home with her husband and twin boys, Chicago’s Eboni S. Gates plans to wear decadent black silk pajama bottoms and a blouse. “I want to be relaxed, happy, cozy and luxurious,” said the 46-year-old head of VIP relations at Expo Chicago. “It’s been an emotionally tense year. I feel like I need to pamper myself a little bit. I think we all do.”</td>

Earlier this week the U.K. became the first Western nation to grant emergency-use authorization for a Covid-19 vaccine. A shot developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and Germany’s  BioNTech SE  could be distributed in limited quantities imminently.<br />Facebook has come under fire in recent years by government agencies, politicians and others for its handling of the spread of misinformation. With additional Covid-19 vaccines expected to gain approval from regulators world-wide, the company is sharpening its focus on public health-related misinformation. Health experts say inoculations are critical to help end the pandemic, yet surveys show many people are hesitant or opposed to getting vaccinated.</td>

Ryanair chose to exercise the option it had to buy additional aircraft on top of 135 it had previously agreed to buy from Boeing.<br />The Ryanair deal is a reprieve for the struggling Chicago-based aerospace giant, which has lost hundreds of MAX orders amid a nearly two-year grounding following two fatal crashes of the jet——and is now struggling amid a pandemic that has sapped demand for air travel. The U.S. last month approved the MAX for passenger flights again, issuing a set of safety directives and notices to airlines globally.<br />Michael O’Leary, the airline’s chief executive, said it would accelerate its delivery schedule for the jets, saying the order would help the airline’s growth as travel demand returns. “We’re proud to buy them. We’re proud to fly them,” he said.<br />As of last month, airlines and aircraft-leasing firms had canceled about 10% of Boeing’s outstanding MAX orders this year.

Flocked pinecones and glittery globes are positively tone deaf. “In this historic year, we’ve noticed in ourselves and our clients a renewed appreciation for simple, natural treasures,” said Kelsey Ter Meer, principal designer at Heart & Soil Flowers, in Newburgh, N.Y.<br />Limited ingredients characterize this season’s crop. Pottery Barn’s Dried Wheat Wreath, for example, comprises a sheaf-like circle of stalks, symbolizing prosperity and good fortune.<br />Bloomist’s halo of pink peppercorns, above, adorned only with a cluster of off-center pinecones, discretely brings color.<br />The Rosemary and Lavender Wreath from  Williams Sonoma ,  incorporates materials that align with two big 2020 themes: Rosemary has been associated with remembrance since ancient Greece, and lavender is used as a natural sleep aid.<br />Terrain’s strangely beautiful Shelf Mushroom and Moss Wreath, made of sponge mushrooms and velvety greenery, conjures nature in its most primitive form.</td>

Across the country, dry-ice makers are planning to boost production of the frigid storage material needed to ship hundreds of millions of doses to hospitals, pharmacies and physicians’ offices.<br />Brad Dunn, vice president of Cee Kay Supply Inc., which makes dry ice at three Missouri plants, said he has fielded calls from public-health departments, medical-supply and logistics companies planning to take part in what  Pfizer Inc.  has called its biggest vaccination campaign ever.<br />Pfizer is expected to have the first Covid-19 vaccine cleared by U.S. regulators, kicking off a mass vaccination drive that will eventually include other shots. The drugmaker expects to distribute 25 million doses in the U.S. this year and another 1.3 billion globally in 2021.<br />Few pharmaceutical products have required such low temperatures for storage and transit. Pfizer’s vaccine must be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius to remain stable and effective. The temperature of dry ice is around minus 78 degrees Celsius. A vaccine  Moderna Inc.  is developming must also be stored at cold temperatures, though not as low as those Pfizer’s shot requires. Once thawed, Pfizer’s vaccine can be refrigerated for up to five days.</td>

      <td>A recent Vogue photoshoot showing the singer in a full-length frock nearly broke the internet—underscoring the almost unprecedented influence he has over young men’s fashion decisions</td>
      <td>HARRY STYLES wore a dress. You may well know that already even if you don’t follow fashion or music closely. Photos of the British singer in the custom Gucci frock—snapped for the cover of Vogue—swarmed the internet a few weeks ago, sending his brigade of fans into a tizzy. Scads of tweets and online articles recycled the images. And while most of the coverage lauded Mr. Styles for his beguiling, gender-bending outfit, some conservative pundits including Candace Owens predictably wrung their hands, interpreting the hubbub as a death knell for the so-called “manly man.” The cover itself was a landmark: Mr. Styles is the first man to grace the cover of Vogue solo. Think of the instantly collectible issue as a coronation of sorts, confirming that the 26-year-old singer is now officially style-royalty.<br />Mr. Styles, who rose to fame as a member of the boy band One Direction before going solo, has been a fashion provocateur for several years now. A muse to Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele, he consistently wears the label’s rather unisex wares such as tapestry print trousers, lithe loafers and pussy-bow blouses. (Representatives for the artist did not respond to a request for comment for this story and, through a representative, his stylist Harry Lambert declined to comment.)<br />On Instagram, feverish fan accounts like @Hsfashionarchive (which has over 100,000 followers) vie to identify whatever Mr. Styles is photographed wearing, from whimsically wide floral pants by British designer Steven Stokey Daley to a candy-colored necklace by New York jewelers Eliou. This year Mr. Styles topped the “Power Dressers” list on Lyst, a fashion-focused search platform, reflecting the strong correlation between his clothing choices and what online shoppers seek. Camilla Clarkson, communications director at Lyst, noted that Mr. Styles’s “non-binary style” helps drive his popularity, particularly with a younger generation that liberally shops across gender lines.<br />Some older observers, however, regard Mr. Styles’s fashion choices through a “been there, seen that” lens. “It’s kind of like this year’s version of rock-star packaging or something,” said Vincent Boucher, 67, a lecturer at Parsons School of Design in New York. As precursors, Mr. Boucher pointed to Kurt Cobain, Mick Jagger and David Bowie, all of whom donned dresses decades ago, nimbly crossing gender lines. (I’d add to that list the lesser-known, openly gay disco singer Sylvester, who frequently vacillated between men’s and women’s clothing—see the video for his 1978 number-one hit, “You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real).”)<br />Mr. Styles’s Vogue cover elicited little more than “a shrug” from Andrew Groves, 52, a fashion professor at Westminster University in London. As Prof. Groves pointed out, when Bowie wore a dress in the early ‘70s, it was “really provocative because it was outside society’s norms.”</td>

Increased volatility before and after the election fueled much of the surge, along with growing adoption of electronic trading, the company said.<br />“The vast majority of folks inside Tradeweb and at our clients are working remotely, and that change in environment provided an opportunity for firms like us,” said Lee Olesky, Tradeweb’s chief executive. “You don’t have anyone sitting next to you, and you don’t have as many screens and data sources.

      <td>Amid a wave of optimism in financial markets, investors can relax about the expected profit rebound in 2021. They might worry more about 2022.<br />Even as Western nations struggle to contain another jump in Covid-19 infections, most S&P 500 sectors are now up year-to-date. Yet equities didn’t get much of a boost Wednesday when the U.K. approved for use the vaccine made by  Pfizer  and  BioNTech .  The power of good news about the pandemic seems to be subject to diminishing returns, raising the question: Is the profit rebound mostly priced in?<br />Wall Street is factoring in a 22% increase in S&P 500 earnings per share for next year. This seems reasonable, even cautious, following the expected 15% fall this year. This summer showed that consumption can return very quickly when restrictions are eased, and global trade and manufacturing already seem to be on a steady path to recovery. In 2010, after the global financial crash, profit growth was 40% as a result of a dismal 2009.<br />But forecasts for 2022, the first “normal” year after the crisis, say more about what the market is thinking. Those expectations look less grounded.<br />As of now, S&P 500 earnings per share are seen expanding another 17% in 2022. This is in line with what happened in 2011, when they rose 15%. Back then, however, profits were far less elevated because the downturn had lasted longer: Relative to their 2007 peak, they were up only 11% in 2011. Current expectations of 2022 earnings place them 21% above 2019 levels. Consumer-cyclical companies such as auto makers and hotels would be up 35% overall.</td>

      <td>BY THIS TIME in a normal year, I would only be testing vehicles from the following model year, e.g., 2021. Our guest this week, a 2020 Land Rover Defender 110 P400 SE, is about six months late to my party due to delays in production, trans-ocean logistics and overland delivery. The new Defender can climb a wall but it can’t get over Covid-19.<br />Four-door 110 models are now arriving at U.S. dealerships, but production of the two-door 90 models at Nitra, Slovakia, has been set back. Making matters worse: The 90, on a shortened wheelbase, is the cutest damn thing you ever did see—funky fresh and coltish, the SUV preferred by Serengeti game wardens who are also boy-band heartthrobs.<br />The new Defender is a triumph of industrial design, a big, beautiful box of postcolonial nostalgia, if not amnesia, evoking the primitive overlanders of empire while being nothing like them internally. It is to the old what  BMW ’s  New Mini (circa 2000) was to Sir Alec Issigonis’ postwar tobacco tin. Defender’s heritage cues—the blocky volumes, the upright windshield, chamfered horizontal shoulder lines, shoebox greenhouse, white-capped roof with alpine windows—have all been redrafted here in a kind of eight-bit, Minecraft modernity.<br />The anatomy is familiar. Defender shares engines and drivetrain components with the Discovery and other Jaguar Land Rover products; the chassis comprises heavy-duty versions of JLR’s long-travel multi-link suspension, adaptive dampers, and ride-height adjustable pneumatic springs. Defender does get its own, new and prodigious platform, a bonded aluminum monocoque that feels like it could shake off a land mine.<br />It’s easier to list what’s lovable about the Defender—hose-able floors, sharkskin-like cabin trim, optional frontbench seating—than to explain why, exactly, anyone would buy one, especially in the first year. I’d be terrified. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) products have some of the worst reliability scores in the industry; and some Defenders already in-country have manifested serious problems.</td>

Among the biggest beneficiaries: Canadian banks, which have avoided major loan losses and boosted deposits.<br />The biggest Canadian banks,  Royal Bank of Canada  and TD Bank Group, reported earnings growth during their fiscal fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, boosted by lower provisions for loan losses.<br />Canada’s federal and provincial governments spent 382 billion Canadian dollars on virus-related relief this year, equal to almost $300 billion, and accounting for roughly one-fifth of Canada’s total economic output in the third quarter. The money included funding for income and wage supports for people who lost jobs or worked fewer hours during the pandemic, zero-interest-rate loans for small businesses, and loan guarantees.<br />Bolstered by those supports, Canadians have continued making loan and credit-card payments they may have otherwise missed. The relief has been coupled with bank-led deferral programs that let homeowners delay mortgage payments, and the net effect has allowed banks to avoid writing off big chunks of their lending books.<br />TD Bank, which owns the 10th-largest bank in the U.S. by assets, reported on Thursday it provisioned C$149 million less in its Canadian retail unit during the fourth quarter than it had a year ago, and attributed the decline to bank and government assistance programs.</td>

      <td>Marc Agronin is a geriatric psychiatrist at Miami Jewish Health and the author of “The End of Old Age: Living a Longer, More Purposeful Life”<br />Stay-at-home orders and continuing social distancing have increased virtual communication among many extended families during the coronavirus pandemic. Most notably, some older adults who once viewed themselves as technological Luddites have learned to log into Zoom chats as frequently as the average teenager on Instagram or TikTok.<br />And with the coronavirus pandemic on track to get much worse before it gets better, all this Zooming is likely to continue for a while. So how can an older person get the most out of these virtual connections with family, friends and health-care professionals?<br /><br />First, we should acknowledge that for many seniors, video calls and meetings on Zoom and other platforms typically have a small sensory field, limited by the size of the screen being used, the volume of the speakers and the integrity of the connection. As a result, it can be a struggle for someone with vision or hearing loss. Some people try to compensate by getting closer to the screen. Poor internet connections exacerbate sensory deficits, leading to frustration and sometimes a premature end to the call.</td>

During his time as president, from 1974 to 1981, France lowered its voting age to 18, allowed divorce by mutual consent and legalized abortion, a fight spearheaded by his health minister, Simone Veil.<br />“The directions he set for France still guide our steps,” said French President Emmanuel Macron in an overnight communiqué, ahead of a televised speech planned for Thursday evening, in which he described his predecessor as a “servant of the state, politician of progress and freedom” whose his death is a cause of “mourning for the French nation.”<br />Mr. Giscard d’Estaing embodied of a style of politics that would later shape the thinking of centrist leaders such as Mr. Macron. He worked across borders to develop multilateral institutions that would allow Western allies to coordinate in fighting global crises and cooperate in setting economic and foreign policy. He deepened France’s alliance with Germany; was an architect of the European Monetary Union that paved the way for the euro; and shepherded annual summits of wealthy nations that eventually grew into the Group of Seven.</td>

That follows two consecutive increases and comes amid evidence that the economy continues to recover from the spring’s shutdowns, but at a slower pace. The previous week’s level was higher than any recorded before this year, but well down from a peak of nearly 7 million in late March.<br />The weekly claims data, which policy makers and investors have relied on throughout the pandemic for timely information about the labor market, came under scrutiny this week after a government watchdog said the data were flawed. The Government Accountability Office said in a report that states have provided inconsistent data to the Labor Department and incidents of fraud have distorted the numbers.<br />The Labor Department agreed to clarify how jobless claims are counted in the weekly jobless-claims report, but an agency spokeswoman said the department didn’t anticipate any changes in methodology.<br />Other recent data, from the Commerce Department, suggest the economic recovery from the spring’s shutdowns has continued. Consumer spending and retail sales both rose in October, though at a slower pace compared with prior months.

Nasdaq-100 futures edged 0.2% higher, pointing to a muted advance in tech stocks after the opening bell.<br />Trading has been choppy this week as November’s explosive rally in global stocks lost steam. The S&P 500 has repeatedly eked out fresh records on the back of investors’ optimism that Covid-19 vaccines will accelerate the economic rebound next year. But rich valuations for stocks and elevated infection levels are tempering some of that cheer, leading to a more subdued move upward in recent days.<br />“Markets have been driving higher, seeing 2021 as the year economies will snap back,” said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank. “There is concern a lot of the good news is already priced in, so I don’t expect markets to go shooting into the stratosphere any time soon, but we could see a general grind higher.”<br />Ahead of the market open, Tesla gained over 4%.

Regulators in the U.S. and other countries are now evaluating the new two-shot vaccine and other candidates before authorizing them for distribution. Over 3,000 people were reported to have died from Covid-19 in the U.S. on Wednesday, the highest figure since the pandemic began. Pfizer has already begun shipping shots to distribution sites in anticipation of gaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration, which is planning to review the vaccine on Dec. 10 and could authorize its use soon after.<br />However, criminals would face the same logistical challenges as the drug companies in shipping and storing the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and another candidate produced by  Moderna Inc.</td>

      <td>Covid-19 vaccine rollout will aim to inoculate everyone in the country over 50 in just a few months</td>
      <td>LONDON—Britain’s authorization of a Covid-19 vaccine, the first in the West, sets in motion an ambitious plan that will test the capabilities of its state-run National Health Service: Inoculate everybody in the country over 50 within months.<br />The U.K. has been laying the groundwork for some time. Officials organized test runs to refine the logistics of delivering a shot that, in the case of the vaccine developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ,  has to be stored at an ultralow temperature. The government changed the law to allow student doctors, physiotherapists and dental workers to administer the jab. Scientists advising the government have drawn up a provisional list of who should get vaccinated first.<br />The scale and urgency of the task is such that the NHS, already under enormous pressure because of the pandemic, has appealed for retired doctors and nurses to rejoin the service and for thousands of volunteers to train as vaccinators and support staff.<br />The project will be “the biggest vaccination campaign in our history,” NHS Chief Executive Simon Stevens said Wednesday.<br />One major help: Vaccine skepticism is lower in the U.K. than in many other Western countries. A survey by Ipsos in October showed 79% of Britons would get Covid-19 shots if available, compared with 64% in the U.S. and 54% in France.</td>

      <td>Two years ago, Gucci emblazoned its clothes with the New York Yankees logo and the face of Bugs Bunny. Now, the Italian fashion house is embracing Princess Diana and Jackie O.<br />Gucci is courting older, wealthier clientele to stabilize revenue as its five-year run of remarkable growth, fueled by younger shoppers, peters out. Creative Director Alessandro Michele—hailed as a visionary for eclectic, pop-culture infused designs that ignited up social media and attracted millennials and Gen Z—is shifting to more subtle designs that play on the brand’s decades of heritage.<br />“They are going after the largest, yet most neglected, segment of luxury buyers—baby boomers,” said Pauline Brown, professor at Columbia Business School and former head of the North American division of LVMH Moët Hennessy  Louis Vuitton  SE, one of Gucci’s major rivals.<br />“Older consumers not only have the means to buy their products, but they’re living longer, healthier, more fashionable lives,” she said.<br />Executives at Gucci and its parent,  Kering SA,  say they are counting on the new aesthetic to broaden the label’s client base and drive growth, following a four-year run from 2015 when revenue more than doubled. That plan has grown more urgent since the pandemic, as revenue plunged and flocks of tourists from abroad—avid Gucci customers—stayed at home. When a second wave of lockdowns swept the West, brands across the luxury sector scrambled to replace the tourist revenue.</td>

A United cardholder for roughly 15 years, Ms. Moore traveled often. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit and Ms. Moore, 53 years old, scaled back her spending and canceled travel plans.<br />Ms. Moore, a senior director at a national health care organization in Washington, D.C., decided to keep the card after JPMorgan offered her a $200 statement credit. But she has barely used the card since, and is instead mostly using debit cards.<br />Nearly nine months into the pandemic, banks and airlines are scrambling to rescue their airline rewards cards. The companies have deployed the cards for years to win big-spending customers, but the perks they offer—like flight upgrades and airport lounge access—are all but obsolete in a global pandemic.<br />Typically, card companies don’t disclose the volume of spending on their airline cards versus other, more general-purpose cards. But travel purchases were down about 70% on  Visa Inc.  cards in the last quarter compared with a year ago. Travel and entertainment purchases were down 69% on  American Express Co.  cards.<br />Other categories are faring better. At AmEx, spending outside of travel and entertainment was up 1% in the third quarter. (AmEx says this category represents the majority of its cardholder purchases.)</td>

      <td>Europe seems set to end 2020 as a weak spot for the global economy, as business surveys indicate that service providers saw another decline in activity during November, while their Asian counterparts reported a continued pickup.<br />Fresh waves of coronavirus infections prompted many European governments to impose tough new restrictions on businesses and households in late October, measures that are now being eased.<br />By contrast, some Asian countries have largely contained the pandemic, and are easing the less severe restrictions they retained. The result is that while Europe’s largest economies are likely to contract in the final quarter of the year, the recovery in Asia’s largest economies is set to continue.<br />Data firm  IHS Markit  Thursday said its Purchasing Managers Index for the eurozone’s services sector fell to 41.7 in November from 46.9 in October, its lowest level since May. A reading below 50.0 points to a decline in activity, while a reading above that threshold points to an increase.<br />Similar surveys for the U.S. to be released later Thursday are expected to point to a strong rise in activity.</td>

The measure passed the Senate in May and is expected to be signed into law by President Trump.<br />China’s government and financial regulators have long resisted U.S. demands to see the audit papers of Chinese companies whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange or the  Nasdaq Stock Market .<br />While there have been cases of accounting chicanery such as by  Luckin Coffee Inc.,  the risks haven’t deterred investors large and small from buying shares of Chinese technology heavyweights such as  Alibaba Group Holding  Ltd.  and  JD.Com Inc.  The combined market capitalization of the more than 200 U.S.-listed Chinese companies was recently up 53% for the year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, topping $2.2 trillion.<br />In the past decade Chinese companies have collectively raised tens of billions of dollars in U.S. initial public offerings, and follow-on sales of stock and convertible debt, often meeting strong demand.</td>

Prosecutors said the national-security investigation is continuing and opposed bail for the 73-year-old, according to local media. Magistrate Victor So Wai-tak declined bail while setting the next court appearance for April 16, meaning Mr. Lai will be held for 4½ months in prison. Cheung Kim-hung, the chief executive of Apple Daily parent Next Digital, said Mr. Lai will appeal.<br />The decision comes a day after Joshua Wong, a leading face of Hong Kong’s protest movement, was sentenced to more than a year in prison for inciting and organizing a demonstration last year. Fellow activists Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam were also given prison sentences.<br />The indictment against Mr. Lai and Next Digital senior executives Chow Tat-kuen and Wong Wai-keung alleges that a property leased by an Apple Daily-affiliated company from a Hong Kong government entity hadn’t been used as intended, and the trio were in breach of the lease. Messrs. Chow and Wong were both granted bail, while Mr. Lai wasn’t.</td>

      <td>Spending patterns this shopping season show in-store purchases down 16% at department stores but up 212% online</td>
      <td>The coronavirus pandemic has reshaped the 2020 holiday shopping season, with more people buying gifts online and fewer visiting stores. Retailers pushed discounts into October and put their Black Friday deals online. The big shift to e-commerce will test shipping networks in December.<br />The Wall Street Journal is tracking how consumers are spending their money this year. See how the holiday retail season is unfolding below.<br />Data from credit-card transactions show that while shoppers are spending about the same amount of money in person as they did last year, they are spending more online. On Black Friday, electronics stores saw almost four times as much revenue from online credit-card purchases as they did in 2019.<br />Other data trackers say U.S. shoppers are spending less than last year. According to a survey by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics, consumers spent an average of just under $312 on holiday-related purchases from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, down 14% from 2019 but on par with 2018.<br /></td>

      <td>Platform’s design could help company stay in limelight after Covid-19 pandemic subsides</td>
      <td>Etsy  seems to have cornered 2020’s key fashion accessory.<br />The company generated more than $600 million in gross merchandise sales on face masks alone in the second and third quarters, helping its share price more than triple this year. So what happens when mask sales, which are already on the decline, go away? Early holiday sales data are encouraging, suggesting Etsy could continue to climb, buoyed by more-sustainable categories and a defensible business model.<br />In its third-quarter report, Etsy said masks’ percentage of gross merchandise sales had dropped to 11%. It cited a steady monthly deceleration, expecting mask sales to be substantially lower in the fourth quarter compared with a quarter earlier.<br />Still, data from Edison Trends show that Etsy expanded online customer spending on Cyber Monday by 73% year-over-year—well ahead of top retailers such as  Target  and  Amazon ,  at 43% and 19%, respectively.<br />Since it is unlikely that masks were a big holiday gift draw, Etsy’s recent growth seems to imply broad interest in nonmask products that can continue after the coronavirus pandemic subsides. Etsy says that “personalized gift” has actually been the most-searched term on its site this year and that top sellers throughout its recent cyber week sale included such things as custom ornaments and blankets.</td>

      <td>The race to develop the first Covid-19 vaccines has been decided. The battle for market share is just beginning.<br />Regulators in the U.K. have authorized  Pfizer  and  BioNTech ’s  Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, and U.S. regulators are scheduled to complete their own review as soon as late next week. U.S. vaccinations should begin shortly afterward, and regulators will likely authorize  Moderna ’s  vaccine before Christmas.<br />Both vaccines have been shown to be more than 90% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in late stage clinical trials, which raises the bar that future candidates will need to meet. A vaccine developed by Oxford University and  AstraZeneca  has shown far less impressive results. Investors have voted with their wallets: BioNTech’s New York-traded shares have rallied more than 30% over the past month, while Moderna’s stock has more than doubled over that same period.<br />That reaction makes some sense: After all, initial doses will be sold directly to governments at fixed prices, which means that huge profits are likely next year. And the success of the vaccine programs bodes well for other treatments the companies are developing that rely on similar technology.<br />Still, investors expecting that these two companies will dominate this huge market indefinitely are getting ahead of themselves. Key questions about the long-run value of each vaccine program are yet to be resolved.</td>

      <td>Early in his tenure as manager of Tottenham Hotspur, José Mourinho sat down the most lethal English striker of his generation to tell him he wasn’t famous enough. The problem, he lectured Harry Kane, was that people didn’t believe the sport’s truly elite players belonged at a club like Spurs, in a league like England’s.<br />“They still think that movie stars of football belong to other places,” Mourinho told him in 2019, while being filmed by  Amazon ’s  “All or Nothing” documentary crew. “We have to build your status in that direction.”<br />Luckily, Mourinho added, he could help. Mourinho was already a soccer movie star.<br />José Mourinho has been playing the role of José Mourinho for so long now that it’s hard to tell where the veteran soccer manager ends and the rule-breaking, smirking caricature begins. Especially when Mourinho does things like hold an illegal workout in a London park during Britain’s spring lockdown. Or lose a bet to one of his players and shell out $650 for an Iberian ham.<br />The act can be grating to fans of any club that he isn’t currently coaching. But Mourinho is reminding them why he gets away with it nearly two decades after he first shook up European soccer. Underneath the caricature, there remains a serial winner. Ten games into the season, he has Tottenham at the top of the Premier League and mounting a genuine title challenge.</td>
