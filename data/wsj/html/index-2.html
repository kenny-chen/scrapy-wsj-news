      <td>Facebook unit says new rules in India would require ‘mass surveillance’ of user data</td>
      <td>Facebook Inc.’s  WhatsApp said it filed a lawsuit in India to stop new government rules that would require the company to trace users’ encrypted messages, escalating a battle over online speech between American tech firms and the South Asian nation’s ruling party.<br />The messaging service, by far the largest in India, said in a statement that it filed the suit late Tuesday with the New Delhi High Court. The company has argued that the new rules violate Indian law because tracing individuals’ messages would violate their fundamental right to privacy.<br />WhatsApp’s suit comes as a 90-day grace period for compliance with strict new rules from India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology expires. Those rules grant the Indian government sweeping powers to remove content that undermines national security, public order and “decency or morality” and require communications platforms like WhatsApp to be able to trace content back to its creator. In the event that tech companies fail to promptly comply with the government requests, the law says, company employees in India can be held criminally liable.<br />India’s government has come under fire from opposition groups for using such tactics to stifle online criticism over its handling of farmer protests and a surge in Covid-19 cases that has devastated the country in recent weeks.<br />In a statement on its website, WhatsApp said complying with the traceability requirement would force it to break the encryption used to protect communications between its users and “severely undermine” their privacy. Having to track and store such records would be technically inefficient, the company said, and could result in innocent people being investigated by law enforcement.</td>

      <td>Manhattan prosecutors have convened a special grand jury in their investigation of former President Donald Trump and his company, signaling the office is seeking to bring charges in the case, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The development signals that the office is seeking indictments following a multiyear investigation into the Trump Organization and its officers, former prosecutors said. District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. has said the office is investigating possible bank, tax or insurance fraud.<br />Special grand juries typically sit for at least several months, compared with regular grand juries that are impaneled for a month. They often hear multiple complex cases, such as white-collar investigations.<br />“Special grand juries are common when state prosecutors get to the point where they are ready to seek an indictment but the evidence is too complex or lengthy to present during the normal four-week term,” said Daniel R. Alonso, a former federal prosecutor who was Mr. Vance’s former chief assistant.<br />The special grand jury was earlier reported by the Washington Post.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Sen. Bernie Sanders will no longer try to force a Senate vote aimed at stopping a $735 million weapons sale to Israel, according to an aide to Mr. Sanders.<br />The aide said the senator found out Friday that the State Department had already finalized the sale, and it wasn’t clear if he could have forced a vote to block it.<br />Mr. Sanders (I., Vt.) questioned whether U.S. military aid to Israel was helping to keep the peace in the region or fueling conflict. Last week, he introduced a resolution for a Senate vote to block the sale.<br />The Arms Export Control Act allows Congress to block a planned arms sale through a joint resolution of disapproval, with such measures automatically entitled to a vote on the Senate floor. It takes only a simple majority to pass a disapproval resolution, though it would take a two-thirds majority in each chamber to override a presidential veto.<br />Republicans and many Democrats have largely supported the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Israel has a right to defend itself. This month, Israel and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza fought an 11-day war that claimed the lives of more than 250 people, mostly in Gaza, according to the United Nations and Israeli officials. The two sides agreed to a cease-fire late last week.</td>

      <td>Preschool and paid family leave are investments in the future in a way tax cuts for the rich aren’t.</td>
      <td>Do you remember supply-side economics? That’s the doctrine that claimed that lowering taxes (especially on the wealthy) would cause a gusher of growth and bring in more new revenue than it lost.<br />It wasn’t true, as the Reagan and Bush tax cuts demonstrated, according to research conducted by William G. Gale and Andrew A. Samwick for the Brookings Institution. Early returns on the Trump tax cuts show they have done little to stimulate growth as well. But certain supply-side policies really could be counted on to augment aggregate supply and increase output. Some of them were even tax cuts. There was good reason to believe, for example, that making depreciation deductions for business equipment and machinery more generous—part of the 2017 tax law—would boost investment and enhance the capital stock. In fact, the results look disappointing. The share of investment moved up, but only a little.<br />But many of the most promising supply-side policies involve government spending, including investment in physical infrastructure like roads, bridges, ports and airports.<br />The argument for more public investment is essentially the same as the argument for more private investment: If the returns are high enough, future benefits outweigh upfront costs, leaving some “profit” to the investor. All such arguments are strengthened by today’s superlow interest rates, which reduce the cost of capital. Now is the time to invest in the future—both in the private sector and in the public sector.<br />Selecting the right projects, however, is crucial. This means not limiting ourselves to physical investments like factories and roads, because investments in human capital offer many of the highest returns. Fortunately, much of President Biden’s American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan pushes in that direction.</td>

      <td>The major leagues shouldn’t resort to rule changes to prop up batting averages.</td>
      <td>‘There is ample evidence that the public is getting a wee bit tired of all these ‘pitchers duels,’ ” sportswriter Bob Addie noted in 1968. The following year, Major League Baseball lowered the mound and shrank the strike zone to make things easier for batters. This season pitchers are dominating again—in fact, more than ever.<br />There have already been six no-hitters (seven if you count a shortened seven-inning game). The New York Yankees’ Corey Kluber no-hit the Texas Rangers on May 19; the night before, the Detroit Tigers’ Spencer Turnbull did it to the Seattle Mariners.<br />It’s the first time baseball had six no-hit games before June, and the season-long record is eight, set in 1884. It’s not an issue of unprecedented skill. Mr. Turnbull had the distinction only two years ago of being the Major Leagues’ losingest pitcher that season, with 17 losses. His turnaround, dramatic in its own right, reflects a bigger issue for baseball: Strikeouts are way up, batting averages are down, and it’s bad for business.<br />In Mr. Turnbull’s historic game, the losers struck out nine times, but the winning Tigers struck out 12 times themselves. That same night the San Francisco Giants beat the Cincinnati Reds despite striking out 17 times, while the Tampa Bay Rays and Baltimore Orioles combined for 27 strikeouts, and the Colorado Rockies and San Diego Padres totaled 29. The Atlanta Braves had a rough night, striking out 15 times against the New York Mets, so you’d think the team’s ace, Jacob deGrom, who has recorded 65 strikeouts this season, must have been on the mound. No, the Mets did it with an army of seven other pitchers.<br />The reasons for the pitching surge are numerous but clear. Pitchers are better conditioned and stronger, to the point that 100-mile-an-hour fastballs are common. They are also pitching fewer innings a game—relief pitchers often take over after only five or six innings—meaning they can throw as hard as possible without worrying about pacing themselves.</td>

      <td>Jon Levy argues that trust and a sense of community are essential for individuals and businesses who want to cultivate influence.</td>
      <td>Behavioral scientist Jon Levy writes that he was a “broke 28-year-old” when, as part of an unusual social experiment, he started inviting people to his home to cook him dinner, wash his dishes and clean his floors. The guests would not know each others’ identities until they all sat down to eat. Over time, the prestige of the guests would increase to include Nobel laureates, Olympians, business tycoons and artists, thousands of people at hundreds of dinners over the past decade. “The most amusing thing is,” Mr. Levy writes, “they thanked me for it.”<br />In “You’re Invited: The Art and Science of Cultivating Influence,” Mr. Levy explains the social and psychological dynamics behind his Influencers Dinners. He argues for the importance of what researchers call “social integration,” measured by the number of people you engage with during any given day. He cites the research of Brigham Young University’s Julianne Holt-Lunstad, who found, as Mr. Levy puts it, that “if you want to live a long and enjoyable life, the most important thing you can do is surround yourself with people and develop both deep, meaningful relationships and loose associations.” That means spending time with old and new friends, and even going to local shops each day instead of relying on Amazon Prime.<br />Famous people, Mr. Levy found, are just as hungry for these meaningful relationships as anyone else. The challenge is making the initial move and then creating a social environment in which such relationships can flourish. “Our influence,” Mr. Levy writes, “is a by-product of who we are connected to, how much they trust us in that capacity, and the sense of community we share.”<br />We connect with people with whom we have something in common. Researchers have found that people with the same initials are 11.3% more likely to connect than those who don’t. This is a phenomenon known as “implicit egotism,” the notion that we are attracted to anything that reminds us of ourselves, however absurdly. “People named Denis are more likely to live in Denver and become dentists,” Mr. Levy writes, and after Hurricane Katrina newborn girls were more likely to be given names beginning with “K.”<br />When people seek out the company of the powerful and influential, Mr. Levy claims, they are after Steam: “status, time, expertise, access and money.” To elicit the attention of the influential person, and the Steam you crave, you need to exhibit generosity, novelty and awe.</td>

Ro Khanna, the bill’s lead House sponsor, with refreshing candor. This is how industrial policy always works in practice.<br />Start with the $54 billion for the not-so-needy U.S. semiconductor industry.

This is where the U.S. has a comparative advantage and China trails by leaps and bounds. Credit American semiconductor research and development spending by private companies.</td>

They identify the Palestinians as the oppressed and Israel as the oppressor. Once this narrative locks in, the facts become secondary. Every step Israel takes to defend its citizens becomes cruel, evil, monstrous.<br />Israel is the freest, most tolerant and most prosperous nation in the Middle East—and its opponents won’t forgive it for that. Israel’s success, so incongruous in the Middle East, must have been achieved through oppression and intolerance, the opponents argue. But in a region that alternates between despotism, Islamism and anarchy, Israel succeeds because it upholds Western values. Jews and Arabs have equal rights and elect their leaders. Could Jews expect the same under Palestinian rule? They can’t in any other Arab state, and the Palestinians demand the expulsion of all Jews from the areas they want to control.</td>

      <td>A new book published by Robert Woodson’s ‘1776 Unites’ debunks the project’s dubious claims.</td>
      <td>Regular readers of these pages need no introduction to Robert Woodson. For the uninitiated, Mr. Woodson is a veteran community activist who broke with the traditional civil-rights leadership in the 1970s after realizing that the agenda of “racial grievance groups” like the NAACP was increasingly at odds with the actual wants and needs of the black underclass.<br />The Washington-based Woodson Center is a community-development organization dedicated to improving conditions in poor neighborhoods, where broken homes, violent crime and abysmal public schools are common. Unlike its liberal counterparts, the center encourages communities to look inward for solutions, as blacks often did with remarkable success before the 1960s, rather than to the government.<br />Yet Mr. Woodson also makes time to push back at the machinations of progressivism. After the  New York Times  published its “1619 Project”—which posits that America’s true founding was not 1776 but 1619, the year African slaves arrived in Virginia, and that the American Revolution was fought primarily to preserve slavery—he became incensed. Not only was it junk history, but it would be disseminated through school curriculums in the name of helping blacks. Mr. Woodson responded by initiating his own project, “1776 Unites,” which enlisted a group of black scholars, journalists and social activists “who uphold the true origins of our nation and the principles through which its founding promise can be fulfilled.”<br />Last week, Mr. Woodson released “Red, White and Black: Rescuing American History from Revisionists and Race Hustlers.” The book is a collection of essays by 1776 Unites participants, and its publication is a public service. In one essay, the Rev. Corey Brooks, who runs a gang-intervention and prisoner re-entry program in Chicago, knocks the 1619 Project’s “over-emphasis on slavery as the defining institution before and during our nation’s founding.” He adds: “The writers who participated in the project jettisoned facts in favor of a fictitious recounting of why our Founders formed a new nation.”<br />In another essay, John McWhorter, a professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia, says the problem is not merely the project’s numerous and well-documented inaccuracies but also its simpleminded approach to a complicated subject. “The 1619 kind of perspective, for all of its elaborate terminology and moral passion vented in serious media organs and entertained by people with PhDs, demands that we abjure complexity,” he writes. “It is a call for dumbing ourselves down in the name of a moral crusade.”</td>

The possible acquisition builds on Amazon’s existing investments in sports and TV.<br />“Streaming is a massive scale business,” said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney. “You probably need to be willing to spend $10 billion a year on content.”<br />The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon could announce a deal to purchase MGM as early as this week, according to people close to the situation, assuming the talks don’t fall apart at the last minute.<br />In pursuing MGM, Amazon is borrowing a page from the playbook of traditional media companies, which have been consolidating to expand their content platforms. Buying a studio with a massive portfolio like MGM gives Amazon a way to fast-track growth for its video-streaming offerings.</td>

      <td>Both oppose a judge’s order to make public an internal DOJ memo.</td>
      <td>Who knew Attorney General Merrick Garland would ride to predecessor Bill Barr’s rescue?<br />On Monday the Justice Department announced it will appeal federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson’s order to release an internal Justice Department memo from the Trump years dealing with the Robert Mueller report. Justice is appealing despite a May 14 plea not to do so from nine of the 11 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee.<br />At issue is a March 2019 Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) memo advising then Attorney General Barr on how to handle the Mueller findings. Mr. Barr’s department took the view that the memo should not be made public because it is part of protected internal deliberations. Under both Mr. Barr and predecessor Jeff Sessions, Justice also opposed a Judicial Watch suit to depose Hillary Clinton and top aide Cheryl Mills about talking points generated after the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. It did so on similar institutional grounds of protecting senior executive branch officials from invasive discovery.<br />In her May 3 order, Judge Jackson accused Mr. Barr of being “disingenuous” and claimed the OLC memo isn’t protected because the AG had already made up his mind. In response, Justice on Monday released the first page and a half of the memo—but has sensibly taken Mr. Barr’s side and kept the rest shielded. No doubt the new AG appreciates the implications for his own internal deliberations.<br />In the process the Justice Department has exposed Judge Jackson’s order for the partisan mischief and judicial overreach it represents. As the appeals court considers what to do, the Biden and Trump administrations are now on the same page. This is what a nonpartisan and even-handed Justice Department policy should look like.</td>

      <td>The White House purges an arts commission over design differences.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden wants an image as a common-man President, less concerned with elite cultural priorities than bread-and-butter economics. But on Monday the White House made an extraordinary intervention on behalf of America’s liberal cultural mavens, decapitating an obscure fine arts commission whose members tend to favor classical building design.<br />The Commission of Fine Arts since 1910 has held advisory authority over the design of Washington, D.C., buildings and monuments such as the Eisenhower Memorial, which opened last year, and the planned memorial for the first Gulf war. Its seven unpaid members are appointed by the President for four-year terms, which they normally complete no matter the outcome of the next election.<br />But the Biden White House on Monday ordered four of the commission’s members, including the chair, Justin Shubow, to resign or be removed that evening. Such removals haven’t been tested legally. A Trump appointee to the Administrative Conference of the United States in February filed suit against his similar removal by the Biden White House, arguing he was entitled to complete a term.<br />Building design isn’t a campaign issue (yet), but the White House’s aggressive move shows how even control over the capital city’s physical appearance is breaking along partisan lines. President Trump in 2020 ordered that the government pursue classical design in federal buildings. Think of the domed, marble Jefferson memorial or the granite pillars of the Treasury building, as opposed to the “modernist” and utilitarian style of the concrete Department of Housing and Urban Development headquarters.<br />With the arts commission purge, President Biden can appoint a majority of the commission and ensure that modern and experimental approaches preferred by most elite architects remain the norm. The field tends to reject the classical style favored by America’s Founders as retrograde at best and exclusionary at worst.</td>

Mr. Bannon had pleaded not guilty and was awaiting trial in Manhattan federal court.<br />The next month, a lawyer for Mr. Bannon asked U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres to dismiss the indictment and end his client’s bail obligations, citing the presidential pardon.<br />The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office then asked Judge Torres to keep the indictment in place. Prosecutors said they didn’t object to the judge terminating Mr. Bannon from the case, meaning he wouldn’t go to trial. But they argued the pardon didn’t erase the fact that the grand jury found probable cause to believe Mr. Bannon committed crimes.<br />The pardon also doesn’t “undercut the evidence of his involvement therein which the government expects to elicit as part of its presentation at trial,” the prosecutors wrote.  Mr. Bannon’s three co-defendants, who weren’t pardoned, are expected to go to trial later this year.</td>

      <td>‘Shuffle Along,’ which opened on the Great White Way in May 1921, quickly became a triumph, breaking down barriers for African-Americans.</td>
      <td><br /><br /><br />One hundred years ago this month, a Broadway musical opened that defied all expectations and broke down barriers for African-American performing artists. “Shuffle Along” became one of the first successful shows written, staged and performed by Black people, and the first to make Black dance an integral part of the production.<br />The musical combined the talents of the vaudeville team of Flournoy Miller and Aubrey Lyles, who contributed comedic routines about two politicians in a fictional Southern town, with the lyrics of Noble Sissle and the music of Eubie Blake—the most consequential of the four, who had begun his career as a ragtime pianist.</td>

      <td>On Discovery+, documentarian Erik Nelson combines previously unseen color footage of the Pacific war and nakedly honest interviews with veterans who survived it.</td>
      <td>Given the innumerable histories, novels, dramas, memoirs and endless hours of film and video devoted to telling the story of World War II, there would seem little new to be done with material that has had at least 75 years to circulate. But that’s precisely why “Apocalypse ’45” feels so fresh.<br />It seems a near impossibility that any of the footage in this Discovery+ presentation could have gone previously unseen, but such is the case. “Apocalypse ’45” director Erik Nelson was given access to more than 700 reels of unreleased film from the National Archives (thanks to the success, we are told, of his previous archival feature, “The Cold Blue,” which concerned the Hollywood director William Wyler and the combat missions Wyler and his film crew flew in 1943). All the film we see is in color, which gives an alarming immediacy to a war most of us are more used to having seen re-created in dusty black and white. It is all the work of the combat photographers who documented the late stages of the Pacific war—including the battles of Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Manila, the fire-bombing of Tokyo and the August 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The material is often intimate, often heartbreaking: As the camera surveys a lineup of youthful faces en route to Iwo Jima, for example, all one can contemplate is the sense of “impending death” that one of the film’s interviewees recalls feeling as his ship churned its way toward the Japanese-held island.<br />It’s the naked honesty of those interviews that brings a viewer up short. The storytelling, provided strictly through voiceover, is from servicemen who fought the battles—from the air, aboard ships or storming the islands with machine guns and flame throwers. No faces are shown on camera as they speak (the men are introduced at the end of the film, but matching voices to faces was beyond my capacity). Perhaps because of the partial anonymity they’re provided by director Nelson, or because they’re all in their 90s or better (at least nine of the vets have died since filming was completed), they speak with surprising frankness about their fear, their war and their enemy.<br />They were “vicious people,” one vet says of the Japanese. Someone else contends “they were the bravest damn people around.” The idea that the men were all part of a “Greatest Generation” is dismissed by at least one as hype, but embraced by others. The point is, the recollections and sentiments are as diverse as the people who served, from the vet who declares he was happy to kill the enemy to the one who admits that Pearl Harbor “screwed my whole life up from that moment on.” One witness recalls a shipmate who lost a foot “and was the happiest guy in the world.” There is a general reluctance to glorify the war, or their service—“We just wanted to leave there alive,” one says—and there is virtually no argument made that the decision to drop the A bombs was anything but just, and probably saved millions of lives both American and Japanese.<br />World War II era photographers didn’t have sound film, so everything heard in “Apocalypse ’45” has been imposed by the filmmakers—principally David Hughes (“Black Panther”), whose sound design helps situate the visuals somewhere between memory and delirium, an altered state of consciousness that may not exactly replicate, but certainly strives to emulate, a 75-year-old fog of war. It enhances the poignant moments, which are many: One vet recalls wondering why he and his shipmates were suddenly having steak and eggs for breakfast as they headed toward Iwo Jima. His older self knows exactly why.</td>

      <td>PARIS—French counterintelligence authorities are investigating whether the Russian government was behind an attempt to pay high-profile health and science bloggers to sow public doubts about the safety of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, a French security official said.<br />Several French bloggers said publicly they received emails in recent days from a person claiming to work for a marketing firm called Fazze. The emails, some of which were reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, offered to pay the bloggers to make videos on YouTube, Instagram and other platforms criticizing the vaccine developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech  SE, which has been the most widely used vaccine in France. One blogger told French TV he was offered €2,050 (about $2,500) for a video.<br />The security official said counterintelligence authorities suspect the Kremlin could be responsible for the emails. The official compared the emails to campaigns run by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian firm that U.S. authorities have identified as responsible for Moscow’s effort to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Western officials have said these operations are an attempt by the Kremlin to undermine public confidence in Western institutions.<br />The Kremlin didn’t respond to a request for comment. It has previously dismissed accusations that Russia was using disinformation campaigns against Western vaccines and has denied interfering in the U.S. election.<br />Fazze listed an address in London on its website, which was taken down Tuesday. Fazze isn’t registered as a U.K. company. A post on a Russian employment website describes it as a subsidiary of AdNow, a Moscow-based marketing agency. AdNow didn’t respond to a request for comment. The LinkedIn accounts of Fazze employees, now deleted, show many have been educated in Russian schools, such as Siberian Transport University.</td>

Three other officers await trial.<br />“To deliver real change, we must have accountability when law enforcement officers violate their oaths,” Mr. Biden said in a statement following the one-hour meeting, which was also attended by Vice President Kamala Harris. “We have to act. We face an inflection point.”<br />Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Mr. Floyd’s family, said Mr. Biden’s message during the meeting was that he wanted to sign “the right bill, not a rushed bill.”</td>

There are more than 2.3 million people in New York state with criminal records, according to state officials.<br />The proposed law is currently being considered in the state legislature, and Mr. Myrie said he is hopeful it will be voted on this year. It has the backing of many Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans, he said. “Not only is this the morally right thing to do,” said Mr. Myrie. “It makes economic sense.”<br />The bill has the support of some labor unions and corporations such as  JPMorgan Chase  & Co., which sent officials to testify at a May 6 hearing on the bill. A spokesman for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said the governor would review the legislation.</td>

Readers farther afield can enjoy these sites from the comfort of an armchair.<br />Farragut Monument<br />By Augustus Saint-Gaudens; erected 1881; located in Madison Square Park (enter on Fifth Avenue and West 25th Street)<br />The 900-pound bronze statue marked two firsts: the first public work of then-unknown sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and New York’s first monument to the Civil War. Adm. David Glasgow Farragut was known for saying “Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead” before leading his men to victory in the 1864 Battle of Mobile Bay. Though the statue paid tribute to American history, Saint-Gaudens spent three years working on his creation in Paris. The sculptor, a New York native, felt that the French capital “was essential to its successful execution . . . not only because what he called the ‘art current’ ran stronger there, but because sculpture as an art form was taken more seriously [in Paris] than at home,” explains historian David McCullough. The sculptor’s hard work resulted in an imposing statue that conveys determination and authority. Pay special attention to Farragut’s legs. Saint-Gaudens asked his friend Richard Watson Gilder, the editor of Scribner’s Monthly, who was short like the admiral, to model for him.</td>

Members of the group said they would send their new plan to the White House on Thursday, days before an unofficial Memorial Day deadline for progress in the talks.<br />Sen. Roger Wicker (R., Miss.), the top Republican on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said President Biden told the GOP lawmakers during a private meeting earlier this month that he would support a $1 trillion plan over eight years.  Mr. Wicker said the Republican offer would roughly match Mr. Biden’s comments in the meeting.<br />“We’re gonna make it eight years, as the president said he would accept, we’re going to hit a figure very close to what the president said he would accept,” Mr. Wicker said.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki didn’t comment on whether Mr. Biden had signaled support for a $1 trillion plan, saying instead that he had signed off on the $1.7 trillion offer. She said the White House looked forward to receiving a new GOP offer.</td>

Several pilots and security experts asked to review the accounting by The Wall Street Journal said it appeared to be genuine, based on the terminology and back-and-forth typical of such conversations. Some said the Ryanair pilots, who repeatedly asked for clarification about the airport at which they were being asked to land, seemed surprised by the request to divert to Minsk.<br />“They definitely hesitated,” said Ben Berman, a retired U.S. airline captain and former accident investigator who is now an airline safety consultant. “They didn’t just accept the statement of the controller.”<br />Dublin-based  Ryanair Holdings  PLC declined to comment.<br />Belarus released the conversation as part of an effort to support the country’s version of events in the unusual incident. The government of President Alexander Lukashenko has said it received a warning that a bomb was aboard the plane, which was in Belarus airspace at the time; notified the plane’s pilots; advised it to reroute to Minsk; and scrambled a jet fighter to escort it there.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Two former  Deutsche Bank  traders convicted of manipulating precious-metals prices shouldn’t go to prison, federal probation officers recommended, sparking a backlash from prosecutors who sought terms of almost five years or more.<br />A federal jury in September convicted James Vorley and Cedric Chanu of wire fraud after a two-week trial over their trading of gold and silver on futures exchanges operated by  CME Group Inc.  Prosecutors alleged the pair engaged in spoofing, a type of rapid-fire market manipulation that traders and regulators say was once rampant in futures markets.<br />The Justice Department has made spoofing a centerpiece of its white-collar crime program; more than 20 people, many of them former employees of global banks, have been charged with spoofing-related crimes since 2014. But last year’s verdict was just the second trial conviction of a futures trader for spoofing. Eight traders have pleaded guilty and one was acquitted, while one other trial ended in a hung jury.<br />The government said in a court filing late last week that it “opposes, in the strongest possible terms,” the U.S. Probation Office’s recommendation that the two men not be imprisoned. The government urged a sentence of between 57 and 71 months. Messrs. Vorley and Chanu are due to be sentenced in late June.<br />“If hard-won trial convictions are not met with serious sentences, there is a real risk that market manipulation crimes will not be prosecuted,” prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum.</td>

      <td>William McGurn lays out an excellent case against state and local tax (SALT) deductions (“Bernie’s SALT in Biden’s Wounds,” Main Street, May 18). There is a further consideration: The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act greatly reduced the tax code’s subsidy to housing and, not incidentally, made tax-return preparation a lot simpler for many taxpayers. Part of the reduction was direct: limiting deductible interest to $750,000 of new mortgage debt. The indirect changes were more important. Various changes made it more difficult to itemize, and therefore more difficult to deduct mortgage interest. This was due not only to the SALT cap but also to the large increase in standard deductions (from $12,700 to $24,000 for most married couples). Numerous minor changes, the narrowing of the casualty-loss deduction, for example, made some contribution. As a result of all these changes, interest deductions dropped 37% from 2017 to 2018. In 2017 46.9 million returns claimed itemized deductions, whereas in 2018 only 17.5 million did. Thus, roughly 30 million taxpayers ceased itemizing and therefore stopped getting any tax benefit from mortgage-interest or SALT payments.<br />A shortage of lower-income housing could be regarded as a market failure that justifies subsidy. Not so with middle- and upper-income housing. Subsidizing such housing warps economic decisions. When you slash SALT deductions and mortgage-interest deductions, you are removing a lot of the tax subsidy for housing. Making itemization more difficult simplifies tax-return preparation for millions of people. Those are good things and ought not be rolled back.<br />Jack Harllee<br />Washington<br /></td>

      <td>Regarding Lance Morrow’s “Can Freedom Survive the Narratives?” (op-ed, May 17): Mr. Morrow worries that the corrosive narratives pedaled by the left may lead us into a sinister autocracy. He views race as a pretext for moving toward a post-capitalism era in which individual liberties are sacrificed for a common good. Marxists dreamed of America’s collectivist transformation, but class warfare couldn't overcome institutional obstacles and general prosperity. However, race-related unfairness and inequality can serve as a backdoor to a similar outcome.<br />Systemic racism is, in effect, a Trojan horse for rooting out what remains of America’s systemic conservatism. Individual responsibility, traditional values and Judeo-Christian faith are impediments to a communal, progressive utopia. In a classic and brilliant bait and switch, the left’s rooting out of racism yanks open the door to statism (i.e., a much more powerful and active federal government) that can remove conservative barriers to progress and force collectivism for a greater good. Legacy media and social media are exposing and canceling conservative heretics who are deemed racists, science deniers and liars.<br />When Alexis de Tocqueville visited America in 1831, he marveled at its success and potential but warned that its great vulnerability was the surrender of freedom without a struggle. If despotism surfaced in a democracy, Tocqueville thought it would be so pervasive as to entirely relieve citizens of the trouble of thinking and all the cares of living. Our systemic-racism exorcism in which systemic conservatism is the real target paves the way for statism. Leftist elites then can take care of us and relieve us of having to think, as long as we surrender some of our freedom. Mr. Morrow is channeling Tocqueville.<br />Ryan Graham<br />Melbourne, Fla.</td>

Khalil Saucier’s Bicycling Magazine article “Cycling and the Power of White Privilege.” In it Mr. Saucier asserts the sport is racist because “world-champion Chloe Dygert ‘liked’ several racist and transphobic tweets. One tweet said ‘white privilege doesn’t exist,’ while another suggested that if football player Colin Kaepernick ‘realized that if he grew an afro and played the part of victim, he could scam the Black community out of millions.’”<br />It is disturbing that it is now accepted by many that believing an entire race is privileged isn’t racist, but arguing that an entire race isn’t privileged is racist. If I think this has turned the definition of racism on its head, does that make me a racist?<br />As far as the criticism of Mr. Kaepernick, criticism of controversial public figures is common. If the race of the object of criticism determines if the criticism is allowed, it again turns the meaning of racism on its head.<br />Mr. Saucier’s extrapolation that an entire sport is racist because a prominent figure in it “liked” some posts to which he takes umbrage is sad. It dilutes the meaning of racism to anything anyone doesn’t like to hear, about a subject on which they’ve decided only their view is legitimate.<br />Don Meltzer</td>

Canada’s dairy protection was one of the key sticking points of the negotiations over the USMCA which was agreed to in 2018, and the U.S. dispute amounts to a formal accusation that Canada isn’t living up to the terms of the agreement.<br />“Launching the first panel request under the agreement will ensure our dairy industry and its workers can seize new opportunities under the USMCA to market and sell U.S. products to Canadian consumers,” said Katherine Tai, the U.S. trade representative and President Biden’s top trade adviser, on Tuesday.<br />The U.S. alleges that Canada has used a complex system of tariff-rate quotas that sets aside a share of the dairy market exclusively for Canadian dairy processors, and that the system is in violation of what Canada agreed to in 2018.<br />The complaint predates the Biden administration—in December of 2020, the Trump administration filed the initial complaint, and the U.S. and Canada discussed the complaint in December, but failed to resolve the issue.</td>

Under global health regulations, China would have to give its consent for WHO to send international scientists into the country again for further studies.<br />Earlier this year, a team of scientists convened by the WHO spent a month in China, as part of an effort to understand the origins of the pandemic.<br />However, the team was largely confined to reviewing research conducted by Chinese state scientists. Some team members expressed frustration that they weren’t given full access to the data Chinese counterparts used to conclude there was little evidence of Covid-19 in China before the first confirmed cases in early December 2019.</td>

      <td>Once a rarity, liberating shorts suits—like the Thom Browne styles the basketball star favors—are gaining popularity as work wardrobes relax. Here, how to successfully sport one this summer.</td>
      <td>THOM BROWNE is America’s foremost authority on shorts suits. The New York-based designer has been selling the knee-baring ensembles—which pair a jacket with shorts, not trousers—since he launched ready-to-wear in 2003. He has sold them to businessmen as well as NBA stars like LeBron James. In April, Alan Kim, the dimple-faced 9-year-old star of “Minari,” attended the Oscars in an adorable pint-size Thom Browne shorts suit.<br />But Mr. Browne himself is the shorts suit’s best model. In an interview for this article, he claimed to have not worn full pants—with or without sport coats—in over a decade. Shorts “are more comfortable,” he said. His sole concession to Mother Nature is that in winter, he wears knee-high socks with his shorts to give his otherwise exposed calves a smidgen of insulation.<br />Mr. Browne’s commitment to abbreviated formality makes him stand out in Manhattan where, as in all American cities, it’s rare to spot a man in a suit with shorts. That’s not at all the case in Bermuda, the look’s natural habitat. Since around the early 20th century, businessmen on the island have worn cropped shorts with ties and blazers to remain formal while combating coastal heat.<br />In landlocked locales, the shorts suit has had shorter luck—not that fashion labels haven’t tried to force the issue. A 1966 photo from the Evening Standard showed a pair of young men striding through a London park in shorts suits by British designer Hardy Amies. But even in swinging London, the style faltered. In the early 2010s, J.Crew introduced shorts versions of its popular Ludlow suit, but the option fizzled out after a couple of years. More recently, the envelope-pushing Japanese label Comme des Garçons has shown billowing shorts suits at its runway shows, but such experiments barely resonate outside the high-fashion world.<br />When Drew Taylor, 34, moved to scorching Atlanta five years ago, he wanted an everyday shorts suit, but it proved elusive. He couldn’t find a single economical option. (Mr. Browne’s well-known versions ring up at around $3,000.) Mr. Taylor took matters into his own hands by hemming the pants half of suits from thrifty brands like  H&M  into shorts. He continues to make his own shorts suits—now with the assistance of a more skilled tailor—and though he’s since relocated to more temperate Boston, he breaks them out in spring when the temperature exceeds 75 degrees.</td>

Two days after Mr. Putin’s proxy in Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, forced a passenger jet to land in Minsk to arrest a blogger critical of his rule, the Russian dictator is rewarded with this symbolic elevation of his global status.<br />Mr. Biden’s gift to Mr. Putin coincided with word that Mr. Lukashenko is abusing the blogger, 26-year-old Roman Protasevich. Mr. Protasevich appeared in a staged “confession” video in which he supposedly admits to organizing protests. There are reports he has been beaten in prison, and may have been taken to a hospital as a result.<br />Mr. Lukashenko’s hijacking gambit was so dangerous and provocative it’s hard to see how he would have proceeded without at least tacit approval from his patron in the Kremlin. The stunt involved a fake bomb threat and scrambling a military jet against a civilian airliner flying between two NATO and European Union member states.<br />The EU already has imposed a first round of sanctions by barring civilian planes from flying through Belarusian airspace. Other sanctions, including from the United Kingdom, may follow, deepening Minsk’s economic dependence on Russia. The Kremlin is denouncing the EU and defending Mr. Lukashenko.<br />Then there’s Mr. Biden. It’s impossible to know whether Messrs. Putin and Lukashenko were emboldened specifically by Mr. Biden’s recent lifting of sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. That easing came as Mr. Putin imprisons his own vocal domestic opponent, Alexei Navalny.</td>

      <td>Timeshares don’t sell themselves. Neither do their reasonably valued shares.<br />With travel roaring back, consumers are likely to be a promiscuous bunch, perhaps opting for home shares one day and hotels the next. By design, timeshares lock in their business for the long term. Closing the sale has always been hard, though. Travel + Leisure Co. (previously Wyndham Destinations), gave a whopping 945,000 tours in 2019. In the first quarter of 2021,  Marriott Vacations Worldwide  reported sales and marketing amounted to 67% of its sales of vacation ownership products. By comparison,  Airbnb  spent only about a quarter of its revenue on marketing in that period.<br />But you haven’t heard the pitch yet. Coming off a year of lockdowns, consumers say they value the space and privacy of a home share. Soon, they might be back to wanting the amenities and trusted brand name of a hotel. Timeshares can offer both.<br />The industry has evolved since the days when people bought a set week in a set room at a set resort. Today, the largest timeshare companies offer consumers the ability to use points to travel to their resorts across the world for varying periods priced according to demand.<br />Timeshare companies mainly make their money in three ways: sales, fees and financing. Offering financing is often key to selling prospective buyers on the spot who wander into a presentation from the beach with a margarita, but little ready cash, in hand. Interest on timeshare loans typically runs 13% to 14%, according to Jefferies analyst David Katz, making the spread compelling in the current interest-rate environment. Publicly traded timeshare companies like  Hilton Grand Vacations  will sell to anyone, but they have the benefit of an easier approach to their collective millions of hotel members already committed to their brands.</td>

      <td>The most bragworthy hotel in Europe is set to open at Versailles in June. That’s just one reason why this favorite day-trip destination deserves a longer stay.</td>
      <td>FRANCE IS EXPECTED to welcome tourists again as of June 9, one year, two months and 23 days after the border first closed. But who’s counting? If you’re ready to rush back and spare no expense, set your sights on Le Grand Contrôle, a new 14-room hotel situated on the grounds of the Château de Versailles, Louis XIV’s royal residence. The hotel, due to open June 1, occupies three buildings on the estate, including one that housed the Sun King’s finance ministry and overlooks the magnificent Orangery. Guest rooms, fittingly maximalist, are swathed in toile de Jouy fabrics and wallpaper and furnished with 18th-century antiques. Chef Alain Ducasse oversees the hotel restaurant, while the Valmont spa touts treatments inspired by Marie-Antoinette, such as the “Majestic Mirror” facial and “Divine Hand Beauty” massage for 455 euros (about $556). But for hotel guests, the most bragworthy lure is access: They’ll get private tours of the palace after-hours and can wander the Orangery gardens on their own after the standard stream of visitors have left. Rooms, unsurprisingly, go for princely sums—from about $2,070 a night (airelles.com).<br />If that seems too steep or reservations are tough to come by, the nearby Waldorf Astoria Versailles—Trianon Palace is a posh plan B (from about $260 a night, waldorfastoriaversailles.fr). In any case, resist the too-common urge to confine Versailles to a day trip from Paris, though it’s just 11 miles west. Tempting as it is to whisk over for an afternoon, the palace alone warrants unhurried exploration, as does the rest of the estate, which has emerged from a six-month pandemic-induced closure flaunting renovations. Redone, restored or revamped are: the bijou stage at Le Petit Trianon, known as the Theatre de la Reine, where Marie-Antoinette made the occasional exhibitionist appearance; the Chapelle Royale, where the king and queen worshiped; and Louis XV’s and Louis XVI’s private apartments.<br />To see the latter, you’ll need a guide. One fine choice is Brigitte Vergnolle, who runs the bespoke travel service Paris Addict and offers a five-hour private tour of the château, including the grand salons and the apartments for about $1,580 for up to 20 (parisaddict.com).<br />Beyond the château, it’s easy to linger in the elegant town of Versailles itself. Seek out the Musée Lambinet, a 1751 house turned museum, with its eclectic collection of paintings and decorative arts (versailles.fr/museelambinet); the vegetable garden that supplied the kitchens of Versailles (potager-du-roi.fr); and La Salle du Jeu de Paume, the former royal tennis court where the first constitution of France was conceived just after the start of the French Revolution (chateauversailles.fr). Versailles has also become a seriously good food town. The local chef not to miss is Jean-Baptiste Lavergne-Morazzani, whose La Table du 11 features vivid contemporary French cooking (latabledu11.com).<br />The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.

      <td>Partisan combat doesn’t preclude progress on China or police reform.</td>
      <td>The American constitutional system functions well when one political party dominates the government or when two evenly matched parties have enough common ground to make compromises. When both parties are closely and deeply divided, gridlock is the norm and legislative success the exception. With thin margins in Congress, this is the situation Joe Biden faced as he took the oath of office.<br />The early comparisons between Joe Biden and Franklin D. Roosevelt (or Lyndon B. Johnson) ignored this reality. After FDR routed Herbert Hoover in 1932, he assumed office with a majority of 313-117 in the House and 58-37 in the Senate. In the depth of the Great Depression, Democrats were willing to approve just about anything the president proposed, and the Republicans didn’t matter.<br />After LBJ’s overwhelming defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964, Democrats controlled the House by a majority of 295-140 and the Senate 68-32. Although the split between Northern and Southern Democrats complicated the path to civil-rights legislation, President Johnson could mobilize large partisan majorities, often supplemented by the votes of moderate and liberal Republicans, to enact much of his agenda.<br />By contrast, the past three decades have been an era of closely balanced parties unprecedented in American political history. Of the 17 presidential elections between 1920 and 1984, 11 were decided with popular-vote landslides of 10 points or more. In the eight elections since 1984, not one candidate has reached that margin of victory.<br />Democrats held the majority in the House for four unbroken decades after the 1954 election. Since then, the chamber has changed hands four times (in 1994, 2006, 2010 and 2018). There is a better than even chance that the House flips again in 2022.</td>

      <td>The existence of bitcoin and the rest benefits nobody except criminals and speculators.</td>
      <td>No one is out of reach from ransomware attacks. The Colonial Pipeline hack made that clear, along with the nearly 2,500 cases of ransomware—a form of malware that encrypts computer files and holds them for ransom—reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation last year, a 66% annual increase. In 2020 ransomware victims paid hackers $350 million in cryptocurrency. Since many victims pay ransom without reporting the incident, these numbers understate the damage.<br />The solutions floated after the Colonial hack—improved cybersecurity in the private sector and public-private collaboration to protect critical infrastructure—are pro forma and inadequate. There is a simpler and more effective way to stop the ransomware pandemic: Ban cryptocurrency.<br />Ransomware can’t succeed without cryptocurrency. The pseudonymity that crypto provides has made it the exclusive method of payment for hackers. It makes their job relatively safe and easy. There is even a new business model in which developers sell or lease ransomware, empowering malicious actors who aren’t tech-savvy themselves to receive payment quickly and securely. Before cryptocurrency, attackers had to set up shell companies to receive credit-card payments or request ransom payment in prepaid cash cards, leaving a trail in either case. It is no coincidence that ransomware attacks exploded with the emergence of cryptocurrency.<br />Banning anything runs counter to the American ethos, but as our experience with social media should teach us, the innovative isn’t always an unalloyed good. A sober assessment of cryptocurrency must conclude that the damage wrought by crypto-fueled ransomware vastly outweighs any benefits from cryptocurrency.<br />It isn’t obvious that cryptocurrency provides any benefit at all beyond the chance to make a quick buck. I have been studying the crypto market since its inception, and I have yet to identify a single task or process that crypto makes easier, better, cheaper or faster. Don’t take my word for it.

      <td>Gov. Ron DeSantis said the new law aims to protect social-media users</td>
      <td>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill on Monday aimed at making big tech platforms more accountable for their content decisions, a move with political overtones that appeared likely to draw legal challenges.<br />Mr. DeSantis, a potential GOP presidential contender with ties to former President Donald Trump, said the legislation could help conservatives defend themselves from unfair de-platforming and other online restrictions. Social-media companies generally deny that their decisions to ban or otherwise restrict content and users are skewed by political bias.<br />The bill says that “social media platforms have unfairly censored, shadow banned [and] de-platformed” Floridians.<br />It would prohibit tech platforms from banning Florida political candidates. The bill says large social-media platforms may not ban or delete the account of a Florida political candidate for more than 14 days, and authorizes a fine of $250,000 a day for violations related to candidates running for statewide office. It also outlaws censoring or de-platforming journalistic enterprises based on content, in an apparent response to  Facebook ’s  and  Twitter ’s  decisions—later reversed—to limit sharing of an October New York Post article that made allegations about Hunter Biden, President Biden’s son.<br />The bill also requires social-media companies to be transparent about their content moderation practices and give users notice of changes to their policies. People who are treated unfairly in content decisions will have the right to sue companies that violate the law and win money damages, Mr. DeSantis said. The legislation would apply to companies with at least 100 million monthly users world-wide.</td>

      <td>TEHRAN—Iran’s electoral body disqualified dozens of candidates for the country’s June presidential election, including nearly all moderates and reformists, a step that narrows the spectrum for political participation at a time when the Islamic Republic faces growing domestic discontent.<br />The culling of candidates near the center of Iranian politics helps smooth a path to victory for Ebrahim Raisi, a leading hard-line cleric who was defeated in the 2017 election. Analysts warn the move risks reducing voter turnout and further diminishing the popularity of a clerical-led system that has suppressed repeated bouts of political and economic unrest.<br />“It seems the hard-liners’ plan to fully monopolize power in their hands very much overshadows any desire to present elections in the Islamic Republic as proof of the system’s legitimacy,” said Ali Fathollah-Nejad, a scholar affiliated with Freie Universität Berlin.<br />While reformists and moderates were almost entirely sidelined, Iran’s Guardian Council, which vets election candidates, also disqualified scores of establishment insiders, most notably Ali Larijani, a former parliament speaker for 12 years until 2020 who was expected to be the main contender with Mr. Raisi. Mr. Larijani is a conservative but closer in views to the current moderate government than Mr. Raisi.<br />In a statement following the announcement by Iran’s state media, Mr. Larijani said he accepted the outcome and encouraged his supporters to vote. Mr. Larijani ran for president in 2005, garnering less than 6% of the vote.</td>

All of the major U.S. wireless carriers say they have nationwide 5G service, but industry analysts say that service is largely indistinguishable from 4G LTE service. Wireless services with speeds notably better than what’s available today may not reach most Americans until later this year at the earliest, research firm Evercore ISI forecasts.<br />“Overall, you’re looking at some time in the end of ‘21 to end of ‘23 to get two-thirds of the country’s population covered with a 5G service that’s notably better than what is currently out there on 4G,” says Evercore analyst James Ratcliffe.<br />That time frame means the first carrier isn’t expected to reach two-thirds of the country with significantly higher-speed 5G until 30 months after the first 5G-capable phones made their debut in mid-2019, Mr. Ratcliffe says, compared with about 18 months for 4G following the launch of the first 4G-capable phones in fall 2010.</td>

Blinken and Netanyahu said they also discussed U.S. efforts to return to the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, which removed economic sanctions on Iran in return for limits on its nuclear program. The Israeli leader reiterated his opposition to the deal, arguing it won’t be effective in preventing Iran from producing nuclear weapons.<br />This week marks the first Middle East trip as secretary of state for Mr. Blinken, who delayed travel earlier because of the coronavirus pandemic.</td>

      <td>Democratic states that locked down harder and longer continue to experience significantly higher unemployment.</td>
      <td>The unemployment rate in April nationwide was 6.1%, but this obscures giant variations in the states. With some exceptions, those run by Democrats such as California (8.3%) and New York (8.2%) continued to suffer significantly higher unemployment than those led by Republicans such as South Dakota (2.8%) and Montana (3.7%).<br />It’s rare to see differences that are so stark based on party control in states. But the current partisan differences reflect different policy choices over the length and severity of pandemic lockdowns and now government benefits such as jobless insurance.<br />Nine of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates are led by Republicans. The exception is Wisconsin whose Supreme Court last May invalidated Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’s lockdown. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin is 3.9%—the same as Indiana—compared to 7.1% in Illinois whose Gov. J.B. Pritzker has been slow to reopen.<br />Jobs may be slow to recover in severe lockdown states if businesses shut down permanently. There may also be a delayed wave of small business closures once owners use up Paycheck Protection Program loans. While Congress made the loans forgivable, businesses that didn’t spend 60% of the proceeds on payroll will have to pay them back.<br />That includes a lot of restaurants and personal care services that were forced to close their doors and lay off workers during lockdowns but still had to pay rent and other overhead costs. In short, the labor market recovery in many states may be slower than it should be.</td>

Under the new law, German regulators can order companies it finds to be of paramount importance to cease certain practices deemed anticompetitive through a faster procedure than traditional competition enforcement.<br />Google “could be considered to be of paramount significance for competition across markets,” given the products it offers, said Andreas Mundt, the president of the Cartel Office. “It is often very difficult for other companies to challenge this position of power.”<br />“People choose Google because it’s helpful, not because they’re forced to, or because they can’t find alternatives,” a Google spokeswoman said, adding that the company will cooperate with the Cartel Office.</td>

Even many homeowners are feeling it when they visit their local hardware stores to buy lumber. Prices are near record territory and more than three times what they were at this time last year, according to industry executives.<br />The cost of softwood lumber, which is often used for framing, is now at a record, up over 83% from this time last year, according to CoStar Advisory Services.

Many are bound to be disappointed.<br />While single-family homes usually perform well during inflationary periods, values of offices, retail buildings and other commercial properties can tumble in value if owners aren’t in a position to increase rents, economists say.<br />Since the Labor Department this month reported a 4.2% annual increase in April consumer prices—the highest rate since 2008—the prospect of inflation has become an obsession in financial markets.<br />Many analysts and investors expect the surge to be brief. They suggest that the inflation jump reflects recent government spending, pent-up demand and production bottlenecks during the reopening of the U.S. economy. These forces should subside, as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic, and more traditional spending patterns resume.<br />But with a number of U.S. companies warning of higher prices, more investors are seeking assets whose value goes up when the value of money goes down.</td>

      <td>Indian police visited  Twitter Inc.’s  office in New Delhi to investigate the company’s labeling of tweets from a ruling party spokesman as misleading, the government’s latest move against U.S. tech platforms amid criticism over its handling of the pandemic.<br />Sambit Patra, a spokesman for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, in posts last week shared what he said was a document from the main opposition party purporting to show instructions for criticizing Mr. Modi’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. India has in recent weeks reported record highs of daily cases and deaths, making it the world’s worst current outbreak.<br />Twitter appended a label to Mr. Patra’s tweets stating that they contained “manipulated media.” A company policy prohibits the posting of images or videos that Twitter determines may be doctored and could cause harm.<br />The Delhi police, which report to India’s Home Ministry, said in a statement late Monday that they visited the social media company’s local office to investigate the tweets’ labeling. “It appears that Twitter has some information which is not known to us on the basis of which they have classified it as such,” the Delhi police said in the statement.<br />The Indian National Congress, the main opposition party, has said the documents Mr. Patra posted are forged. The party on Tuesday released a letter addressed to Twitter in which it highlighted tweets referring to the documents from several other senior government officials, asking Twitter to apply the same labeling to those posts.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—The world’s largest maker of surveillance equipment has long-established links to China’s military, including conducting a study with Chinese weapons experts and supplying cameras and drones to the country’s air force, according to a report by a surveillance-industry research company.<br />The findings by IPVM shed fresh light on  Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. , which has disputed as baseless a decision by the U.S. Defense Department last year to place it on a blacklist of companies with alleged ties to China’s armed forces.<br />According to public documents and online materials found by IPVM, Hikvision sold drones and other accessory equipment to the Chinese air force in 2019 and was considered a top-tier supplier to the nation’s military in 2014. In March, a drone-jamming rifle, emblazoned with a Hikvision logo, was shown on state television being held by a soldier kneeling in rough terrain and testing equipment for use in extreme conditions such as subzero temperatures or high altitudes.<br />Hikvision’s website also carried a report on how the company’s technology could improve the performance of Chinese missile, tank and other weapons systems, citing a study done jointly with commanders and weapons experts from the People’s Liberation Army. The study proposed the use of Hikvision cameras to record drills and improve weapons accuracy. The report was taken down from Hikvision’s website for several days this month after The Wall Street Journal contacted the company for comment.<br />IPVM, an independent research company based in Bethlehem, Pa., that focuses on the surveillance industry, shared its findings with the Journal, which independently corroborated them.</td>

      <td>MEXICO CITY—Abel Murrieta, candidate for mayor in the northern city of Ciudad Obregón, was handing out fliers on a crowded street corner on May 13. Music played from loudspeakers. He smiled and chatted with passersby.<br />Suddenly, two men approached and shot him 10 times in the face, neck and chest, police say. As the 58-year-old lawyer and former state prosecutor lay dying, his killers walked off calmly and terrified bystanders scurried for cover.<br />Across Mexico, variations on that scene have played out in the run-up to midterm elections on June 6. Even in a country with a history of electoral violence, this vote is shaping up as the most bloody in recent memory as more, smaller criminal gangs viciously compete to control local areas by intimidating or killing off politicians.<br />From February to April, 46 elected officials, members of political parties and candidates for office were killed, a 44% jump compared with the 2018 elections, according to Integralia, a Mexican political consulting firm. Since September, when the electoral process began, 82 politicians have been killed, most of them gunned down.<br />More than 60 candidates for mayor withdrew from the campaign across the country amid the spiral of violence and insecurity, according to party officials. One candidate, a former Olympic athlete, was kidnapped for several hours last week by members of a local gang in Valle de Bravo, a high-end weekend retreat for Mexico City residents. The gangsters threatened to kill her if she didn’t quit the race. She hasn’t campaigned since.</td>

      <td>Investors have turned on Discovery’s stock since announcement of deal with AT&T</td>
      <td>Even show-business marriages have longer honeymoon periods than this.<br />Last Monday’s announcement of a mega-media combination of  Discovery Inc.  with the WarnerMedia business of  AT&T  initially thrilled the investors of both companies. Discovery’s share price opened the day up 10% on the prospect of the niche cable-content provider suddenly becoming one of the largest Hollywood players. Meanwhile, AT&T’s share price jumped nearly 4% on the notion that the telecommunications giant could focus better on its core business without having to also pour capital into a media venture that was never popular with its own investors anyway.<br />The warm feelings didn’t last. Both stocks soon turned south and closed in the red that day. And Discovery kept falling—losing nearly 12% by the end of the week. The potential merits of the deal haven’t changed, but the risks have grown clearer. The complicated transaction will result in a much bigger and much more indebted Discovery, run by its current management but majority owned by AT&T shareholders. And the combined company faces a rapidly changing media landscape with a growing list of competitors. For example, last week brought several reports that  Amazon.com  was in takeover discussions with MGM Holdings. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the deal could be announced this week.<br />Discovery’s stock had already been on a wild ride due to its part in the Archegos Capital selloff earlier this year. The pending merger will add some fresh drama. Both Discovery and AT&T have to preserve the value of the WarnerMedia business during a highly uncertain period while awaiting regulatory approvals, which could take a year or more. The New York Times reported that WarnerMedia Chief Executive Officer Jason Kilar already has hired a legal team to negotiate his departure. Doug Creutz of Cowen noted in a report last week that Twentieth Century Fox saw “pretty serious degradation in performance” while Disney was working to complete its acquisition of the studio in 2019. “We’re not sure that the announcement of $3B in synergies will be well-received by WarnerMedia employees, either, particularly having just survived a synergy-driven purge associated with the AT&T acquisition,” he wrote.<br />How to integrate the two operations is also a major question hanging over the deal. As the home for the old Warner Bros. studio along with HBO and the Turner media properties, WarnerMedia specializes in broad offerings designed for mass appeal. Discovery has made its name with more niche offerings such as Animal Planet, TLC and the recently acquired Food Network and HGTV. An investor poll by Bernstein Research found a large split on whether the company should combine the HBO Max and Discovery+ services into one offering. Investors in the poll were also the “least confident” in the combined company’s ability to achieve the stated goal of $15 billion in direct-to-consumer revenue by 2023.</td>

      <td>Despite a commodity boom that is boosting profits, miners aren’t throwing cash at new projects, raising concerns about future shortages of some metals.<br />So-called technology metals, such as cobalt, copper and lithium, are set for particularly large deficits, analysts say, amid rising demand from makers of batteries, electric cars and wind turbines. Supply constraints threaten to slow countries’ plans to reduce emissions and make them more expensive, they say.<br />Though off their highs, many mined commodities have hit record prices this year as the global economy bounces back from Covid-19, governments increase spending on infrastructure and supply stutters for some resources. For instance, the price of copper—used in construction and to conduct electricity—has almost doubled over the past 12 months to a record of $10,762 a metric ton earlier this month.<br />But miners have been reluctant to invest in new projects, analysts and executives say, because their investors have in recent years wanted higher dividends after seeing the sector burn through cash during the last commodity bull run. That hesitancy is now raising the specter of supply crunches.<br />“We are starting to see some pinch points appear in the key energy-transition metals, copper and platinum group metals for example, where there is very little new supply ready to fill the gap,” says  Anglo American  PLC Chief Financial Officer Stephen Pearce.</td>

Her decision in the trial that lasted three weeks and a day is expected in the coming months, and it could sway a new generation of commerce.<br />“It’s safe to say she’s not just convinced that there’s an easy win for Apple,” said David Olson, an associate professor at Boston College Law School who has been following the case. “She’s thinking hard about this and seems to be bothered by the lack of in-app or in-game…payment systems.”<br />The question of how to define a market in the case is a central issue. Is the market confined to distributing apps on the iPhone as “Fortnite” videogame creator Epic argues? Or, as Apple contends, is the market just devices on which videogames can be played?</td>

Advent International Corp., Culligan’s current majority owner, plans to reinvest in the business and hold a minority stake.<br />Based in Rosemont, Ill., Culligan sells products and services for water filtration and treatment. Founded in 1936 as a maker of water softeners, its product lineup now includes items as simple as water-filter pitchers and as complex as whole-house and business-filtration systems. Culligan offers monthly service contracts with most of its products, accounting for about 65% of sales and generating the steady cash flows that private equity prizes.<br />It has more than 7,500 employees and 1,000 dealers in 90 countries, making it one of the largest players in what the company estimates is a $35 billion global market for consumer water services.<br />Under Advent’s ownership, Culligan’s revenue has tripled thanks to an aggressive M&A strategy and high-single-digit organic growth. Culligan has done 90 acquisitions since Advent bought it in 2016, primarily of small, family-owned companies in markets like Germany, Italy and Spain. In 2019, Culligan announced a deal to buy AquaVenture Holdings Ltd., a publicly traded U.S. maker of bottle-free water coolers, for $1.1 billion including debt. It has also expanded into pitchers and machines that dispense filtered water, such as those that might be found in an airport.</td>

      <td>China has several reasons to further crack down on cryptocurrencies</td>
      <td>Bitcoin has recovered some of its losses after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He’s pledge to crack down on mining and trading on Friday. But investors should be cautious with all crypto as far as China is concerned. The government has its own reasons for smothering the sector, and a track record that suggests it will follow through effectively.<br />The first and most obvious reason is the stated one: to limit the risk of financial excesses becoming a broader social issue.<br />In some areas, particularly real estate, the Chinese government has struggled to seriously control expanding leverage and risk. But crypto advocates shouldn’t confuse that for laxity generally.<br />Case in point: peer-to-peer lending. An explosion of platforms and borrowing in 2014 and 2015 attracted attention from regulators, with a particular sharp negative turn in 2018 after a series of small protests against some lenders. The amount of outstanding peer-to-peer loans fell from more than 1 trillion yuan, the equivalent of $155.78 billion, in mid-2018 to less than half that by the end of 2019. By the end of last year, Chinese regulators announced that the sector had been “zeroed out.” Major players either wound down or moved into other businesses.<br />The second reason to smother bitcoin applies to mining particularly: The energy intensity of “mining” increasingly runs at odds with Beijing’s environmental goals. The government has become more ambitious in terms of targets relating to emissions in the past year, and environmental protection is one of the very few areas where there is still any prospect of significant China-U.S. cooperation. It’s hard to see why bitcoin mining would be a priority for increasingly scarce energy use.</td>

Then it briefly became a residence for the country’s founder, Kim Il Sung.<br />Now, it is the site of Pyongyang’s hottest housing development. The modern block of apartments represents a cog in Kim Jong Un’s national strategy to project strength amid economic strife, sanctions and pandemic lockdowns.<br />North Korea has few levers left to pull in pursuit of an economic revitalization without bargaining with the U.S. This is compelling Mr. Kim to give priority to domestic projects that display the regime’s self-image as being the greatest country on Earth.<br />The housing development in central Pyongyang will feature dozens of low-rise buildings and total 800 apartments when completed. Mr. Kim has visited twice in recent weeks. The homes will be “gifts to working people,” North Korea’s state media says, reserved for professionals such as scientists, educators and writers.<br />The modern apartments are the most lavish elements of a broader five-year push to boost the number of homes in Pyongyang by 50,000 units, and even more across a country that has significant housing shortages. Mr. Kim could also use a splashy project to brag about, after admissions of economic shortcomings and calls for more self-sacrifice.</td>

Morgan Asset Management.<br />Bitcoin prices steadied following several days of whipsaw trading for cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin edged down less than 0.1% to $38,812 from late Monday afternoon.

That puts both stocks ahead of big European peers such as Hermès,  LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton  and Gucci-owner Kering.<br />One reason is that the U.S. brands reported better than expected sales in their latest quarterly numbers, thanks in part to strong demand for designer clothing and handbags in China. Their e-commerce businesses are growing quickly: Tapestry’s online sales have doubled in a year and now comprise almost 30% of turnover.<br />The two companies have also managed their inventory levels better lately, allowing them to sell more products at full price and increase their gross margins. And their valuations had more ground to make up after investors fled to the safest luxury stocks such as Birkin handbag maker Hermès throughout 2020.<br />American luxury names have sometimes outperformed in the past, but it isn’t the norm. In terms of share-price gains, Capri has beaten Hermès and LVMH in just three of the last nine calendar years. The U.S. stocks have also been far more volatile, after several years of overexpansion damaged perceptions of their brands among consumers. While Europe’s top couturiers have overexpanded at times too, on the whole they are better at managing their brand image. The continuity provided by anchor shareholders such as LVMH’s Bernard Arnault, the world’s second-richest man, may help.</td>

Mr. Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in April; three other officers await trial.<br />Demonstrators pushed to “defund the police,” reallocating police funds toward social spending and investment in Black communities. Many argued America has yet to come to terms with what they see as a racist history and society.<br />Under pressure, big companies pledged billions of dollars toward diversifying their workforces and suppliers and rolled out new initiatives on training and investment. Some will hold moments of silence or mark the anniversary in other ways on Tuesday.<br />Broader demands for change have reverberated across popular culture. The Golden Globe Awards were canceled after several big entertainment companies and stars said they wouldn’t participate in the awards show or work with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that oversees the event, criticizing what they said was a failure to diversify among other complaints. The National Basketball Association and the National Football League let players wear slogans like “Say Their Names” on uniforms and helmets.

The Chinese companies are also caught up in an official clampdown on China’s tech sector alongside Alibaba and other big players.<br />But these are younger businesses that haven’t become solidly profitable. Analysts polled by FactSet expect Meituan, Pinduoduo and Kuaishou to record net losses this year. That means their valuations are disproportionately sensitive to rising interest rates, which reduce the value of faraway profits more than those that will be earned in the near term.<br />Although everyone is suffering, there is a distinction between China’s profitable and pre-profit tech companies, said Hyde Chen, an equity analyst with the chief investment office of  UBS Group AG’s  global wealth-management unit.</td>

      <td>Covid-19 is spreading rapidly in large developing countries such as Argentina and India, sparking concerns of long-term economic hardship, but prices of their government bonds have barely budged.<br />The disconnect boils down to two factors, analysts and fund managers say. Loose monetary policy and economic reopening in developed countries is fueling global growth. At the same time, some emerging economies can’t afford to shut down. Under those circumstances, investors are willing to hang on to the relatively high-yielding debt, even as cases climb.<br />Bond fund managers remain desperate for government debt that pay attractive returns because yields, which fall when bond prices rise, remain near historic lows in Europe and the U.S. Simultaneously, international demand is booming for the commodities exported by many emerging markets.<br />Indian 10-year bond yields have remained around 6% since infections started to surge compared with the roughly 1.6% paid by the 10-year Treasury note, according to global bond-data provider Cbonds Europe SIA. The Reserve Bank of India bought some bonds to keep the market steady in recent months but international investors also played a part.<br />“Real rates are high in India,” said Polina Kurdyavko, an emerging markets portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management. “All else being equal, it’s attractive.”</td>

Belarus said it did so because of suspicion that explosives were on board.<br />Authorities there then arrested a prominent journalist and opposition activist onboard, before allowing the plane to continue its journey. The incident has sparked an international outcry and raised questions over the legality of the plane’s grounding and the ramifications for the airline industry.<br />The European Union, the U.K., Ukraine and Lithuania banned their own airlines from flying over Belarus. Approximately 3,000 flights each week transit Belarus, according to aircraft tracking firm Flightradar24.<br />The move to avoid the country adds to restrictions already in place in the east of Ukraine following the downing of a Malaysia Airlines jet in 2014. While not presenting a major detour for most airlines, rerouting adds time and additional fuel expenses to flights predominantly between Europe and Southeast Asia.</td>

The Department said it would appeal to keep its legal reasoning in the matter under wraps because it constituted confidential legal advice from the department’s lawyers to then-Attorney General William Barr.<br />The Biden administration sided with its predecessor by saying it intends to appeal the case. The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />In the late Monday filing, the Justice Department said Mr. Barr never considered bringing charges against Mr. Trump due to a longstanding and controversial department policy that a sitting president can’t be indicted.<br />“Commencing an actual prosecution of the president was not an option the attorney general was considering,” the department said in its filing.</td>

Her campaign said it had raised $4.4 million overall, touting her record as an Obama administration Justice Department official, federal prosecutor and top aide to Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez. She spent $3 million on the campaign since January, the most of any of the eight Democratic candidates.<br />Mr. Bragg, a former federal prosecutor and top New York attorney general official, surpassed her in cash on hand.

Mr. Bragg has raised $2 million overall and $712,000 over the past four months, his campaign said.<br />More than half of Ms. Farhadian Weinstein’s recent fundraising came from four dozen donors, many of whom work in the financial sector. Some opponents have questioned whether Ms. Farhadian Weinstein could independently lead an office that prosecutes white-collar crime with so many donations from the financial sector. She has said she would prosecute anyone who breaks the law.<br />Eight Democratic candidates are vying to replace incumbent Cyrus Vance Jr., a three-term Democrat who isn’t running for re-election.

Greg Abbott, who has said he will sign it despite the objections of law enforcement groups who say it would endanger the public and police.<br />Gun control groups also oppose the measure, noting the state’s recent history of mass shootings, including those at a Walmart in El Paso, a church in Sutherland Springs, and a high school outside Houston, though in each of those attacks, the assailants primarily used assault-style rifles, not handguns.<br />Texas already has some of the loosest gun laws in the country and has more than 1.6 million handgun license holders.<br />Supporters of the bill say it would allow Texans to better defend themselves in public while abolishing unnecessary impediments to the constitutional right to bear arms. Once signed into law, Texas will join nearly two dozen other states that allow some form of unregulated carry of a handgun.</td>

The stock has fallen 52% this year, through the close Monday, amid questions about the strength of its preorders and production plans as well as increased competition from legacy auto makers.<br />Lordstown Motors is one of several electric-vehicle startups to go public in a rash of mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies over the past year. While investors initially saw impressive returns, shares of many have since retreated, as the startups missed targets and added costs in their earliest days as publicly traded companies.</td>

      <td>The Court needs to affirm the principle of racial equality or the U.S. will resegregate.</td>
      <td>Nearly every day we learn of another case of governments or others setting policy based on the color of one’s skin. This is contrary to the equal rights fought for and won in the Civil War and civil-rights movement, and the Supreme Court has a rare and valuable chance to reaffirm that principle if it decides to hear the appeal in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard.<br />The particulars concern whether Harvard discriminates against Asian-Americans in its admissions decisions. Harvard won in the lower courts but the Asian-American plaintiffs have appealed to the High Court. The larger stakes are whether the Supreme Court will wink as America divides in ways that have proved so destructive in the past.<br />The temptation will be for the Justices to give Harvard a pass given its contentious subject. The High Court has already taken cases on gun rights and abortion for the next term starting in the autumn. And you can imagine the reluctance to add the combustible issue of race to the docket.<br />This would be a mistake, and not only on the merits of this case. As Justice Clarence Thomas pointed out in 2018 when the Court passed on Kansas and Louisiana laws involving Medicaid funds for Planned Parenthood clinics, Supreme Court Justices are given lifetime tenure precisely so that a “politically fraught issue” will not prevent them from applying the law neutrally.<br />This is what is at stake in Harvard. In America today the principle that drove the civil-rights movement—equality for all—is fast giving way to the view that race must be a dominant factor in every decision from college admission to eligibility for a federal farm program to the makeup of corporate boards to who gets priority for a Covid vaccine.</td>

      <td>New Jersey comes in it at number one in a new ranking of states. Too bad it’s for how much its citizens will pay in taxes over their lifetimes.<br />An average New Jersey resident will pay an estimated $931,698 in taxes for his lifetime of toil, according to a new study from the financial technology company Self. That’s nearly twice the $525,037 for the average American. It’s even more than the $734,563 their neighbors in high-tax New York will pay.<br />The study is based on the 2019 Consumer Expenditures Report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and includes taxes on income, property, consumption (sales tax) and owning a car. It reports that New Jersey also ranks No. 1 in taxes as a share of earnings: 49.51% on estimated lifetime earnings of $1,881,648. Oh, yes, the denizens of the Garden State can also expect to pay the most in lifetime property taxes: $378,087.<br />This grim news will not surprise Garden State residents. The high amount of income New Jerseyans fork over to their governments also explains why New Jersey Members of the U.S. House of Representatives signed letters to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer asking that the $10,000 annual cap on the state-and-local tax (SALT) deduction be repealed. Some say they will hold the infrastructure bill hostage if the SALT cap remains.<br />But the more sensible reading of New Jersey’s dismal tax numbers would be to recognize that restoring the SALT deduction is only a Band-Aid—and mainly helps the affluent. Taxes in New Jersey are high for all residents. The real problem is that the state is dominated by public unions that work with politicians to tax, spend and elect, and then do it again.</td>

China is treating Australia like the chicken, and the latest example is hostage Yang Hengjun, who will face trial in China this week on allegations of espionage.<br />In 2018 Australia angered Beijing by banning Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE from its 5G mobile network. Mr. Yang, a writer and Australian citizen, had the bad luck of traveling to China a few months later.<br />In January 2019, authorities detained him on vague charges of endangering national security, although Aussie Foreign Minister Marise Payne said last week that China has “not provided any explanation or evidence for the charges.” He has been in Chinese custody for more than two years, and Ms. Payne said Mr. Yang has had “no access to his family, and limited, delayed access to his legal representation.”<br />China-Australia relations have since worsened. Canberra called last year for an independent probe into the origins of Covid-19, and Beijing responded by slapping tariffs and trade restrictions on a range of Australian commodities. Ms. Payne further infuriated Beijing this spring when she killed two investment agreements between the state of Victoria and the Chinese government.<br />Mr. Yang’s trial is scheduled to begin May 27, and it looks like China will bar Canadian diplomats from attending as observers. Last week Ms. Payne criticized the legal proceedings as “a closed and opaque process to date.” The Chinese embassy responded with a statement demanding that Australia “respect China’s judicial sovereignty and refrain from interfering in any form in Chinese judicial authorities’ lawful handling of the case.”</td>

      <td>Notebooks, sketch pads, talking with others—all help us to improve our thought processes. We make the world our whiteboard—an extra brain lobe.</td>
      <td>In 1998 philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmers published an article titled “The Extended Mind,” in which they wondered, “Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?” Human beings have long relied on technology—print or digital—to remember things and play with ideas. We live and work and learn in crowds—online or off. The self is permeable; no mind is an island. Sure, the brain sits isolated in a skull, but it feeds on interaction with the outside world.<br />Cognitive scientists have since explored the philosophers’ question in several related fields, including embodied, situated and distributed cognition—respectively, how thought is shaped by bodily experience, physical environments and social exchange. In her book “The Extended Mind,” science writer Annie Murphy Paul takes on each in turn. “Our scientific journals mostly proceed from the premise that the mental organ is a disembodied, placeless, asocial entity, a ‘brain in a vat,’ ” she complains at the beginning. “Our history books spin tales that attribute world-changing breakthroughs to individual men, thinking great thoughts on their own.” While this criticism may be overstated, her efforts to upset these interpretations is fascinating, sure-footed and wide-ranging.<br />First, Ms. Paul argues, we pay too little attention to the body. At the ground level, people differ in their interoception, or perception of internal states. Heartbeat awareness sometimes correlates with decision-making ability, as arousal alerts us to danger before we become consciously aware of it. Meditation supposedly increases such abilities. Ms. Paul notes that we might also be made smarter by movement. Exercise or mere walking sharpens perception; for students, participating in recess can improve classwork. We gain a special benefit from gestures. Speakers moving their hands help speakers think and listeners listen. Gesture comes before speech in evolution, child development and even individual utterances.<br />Working her way outward, Ms. Paul argues that the spaces around us expand our minds. Encountering nature can have salutary effects, whether it’s a walk in the woods or looking out an office window. Greenery reduces rumination and anxiety, increases attention and creativity, and lifts one’s mood and physical health, Ms. Paul notes. Built spaces can also be mind-altering, for good or bad. Open offices were meant to help collaboration but typically increase distraction and reduce interaction. Walls increase privacy and some types of creativity. We work best when we can design our own spaces and control when we work solo and work jointly. Then, Ms. Paul notes, there’s the space of ideas. Thinkers benefit from notebooks, sketch pads, architectural models, concept maps and big or multiple computer screens. You can make the world your whiteboard—and in turn an extra brain lobe.<br />Finally, Ms. Paul says, we can merge with other minds. First, by copying experts, or whoever has gone before, and learning from their wisdom and mistakes. Or by sharing one’s expertise: Teachers sometimes learn more than their students, because they are reviewing and organizing material. Second, Ms. Paul notes, we benefit from working with peers. Open-minded debate helps people find flaws in their arguments, and motivates participants to learn more in preparation. We also learn better from peers’ stories and gossip than we do from dry textbooks. Third, thinking as a group lets us tackle projects that simply elude the grasp of one person, such as operating a navy vessel or a particle accelerator. Groups as small as a married couple help members think by delegating memory duties (where are the yard things versus the house things?).</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The State Department warned Americans against all travel to Japan because of the risk posed by the Covid-19 pandemic on Monday, raising its travel advisory for the country to its highest level two months ahead of the Tokyo Olympics.<br />The State Department’s travel advisories are designed to warn travelers about dangers overseas. It now sets Japan at “Level 4: Do Not Travel.” Americans are still permitted to travel to Japan but do so at their own risk.<br />Last month, the State Department warned against travel to about 80% of the world, as countries continued to grapple with surges of the virus while the situation at home improves.<br />The seven-day rolling average of reported U.S. Covid-19 cases has fallen below 30,000 per day and is steadily decreasing, as more of the nation gets vaccinated against the deadly illness. Nationally, more than 39% of people have been fully vaccinated and over 49% have had at least one vaccine dose.<br />By comparison, Japan has only just begun to roll out the large-scale vaccination of its elderly population. Domestically, opposition to the Olympics is growing. Some prominent Japanese business leaders have warned that holding the games could be more damaging to the economy in the long run.</td>

      <td>Al Sharpton and civil-rights attorney Benjamin Crump led a march in downtown Minneapolis Sunday in advance of the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death on May 25. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of Floyd’s murder last month.<br />Messrs. Sharpton and Crump didn’t visit North Memorial Health Hospital, where two recent victims of a yearlong explosion of violence in Minneapolis are on life support. On April 30 Ladavionne Garrett Jr., 10, was riding in a car with his parents when a gunman opened fire. A bullet pierced Ladavionne’s head; doctors put him in a medically induced coma and removed part of his skull to relieve swelling on the brain. On May 15, 9-year-old Trinity Ottoson-Smith was jumping on a trampoline at a friend’s house when bullets fired from a passing car struck her in the head. She is also in critical condition at North Memorial, in the room next to Ladavionne’s.<br />Nineteen children in Minneapolis have been shot this year, an increase of 171% over the same period in 2020. Their relatives wonder where the protesters are. “Why ain’t nobody mad about a 10-year-old, my grandson, fighting for his life?” asked Sharrie Jennings, Ladavionne’s grandmother, at a May 17 mayoral event. “Because a cop didn’t shoot him, is that why?” Ms. Jennings warned of “a deadly summer” for kids if the mayor and police chief don’t “step up.” Later that day, Aniya Allen, 6, was caught in a shootout between rival gangs while in her mother’s car. Aniya died on May 19.<br />Minneapolis homicides between Jan. 1 and last week were up 108% compared with the same period in 2020; shootings were up 153%, and carjackings 222%. The crime increase began after Floyd’s death and has never let up. Nor has the assault on law enforcement that began with the arson destruction of the Third Precinct building on May 28, 2020. Officers are routinely punched, kicked and hit with projectiles. There was a near-riot in downtown Minneapolis in the early hours of May 22 following a shootout among club patrons. Two people were killed in that shootout and eight wounded. Responding officers called for backup across the Twin Cities at what the department called an “exceptionally chaotic scene.” The previous weekend, officers were maced, and pelted with rocks and debris while trying to disperse disorderly crowds.<br />After Floyd’s death, the Minneapolis City Council called for abolishing the police department and replacing it with a “new transformative model for cultivating safety.” Abolition didn’t happen, but “some folks” in the community got the message anyway that “they have a sort of open season on their enemies,” said Alicia Smith, the executive director of the Corcoran Neighborhood Organization.</td>

We have a divided country, but our education system is going to unite us.” But we can attest the department isn’t eager to hear critical voices. Its effort to shut them out defies Marbury v. Madison (1803), the foundational Supreme Court case that recognized the power of judicial review and established the basic principles of the separation of powers.<br />Late in his term, President Trump appointed eight people, including the two of us, to the National Board for Education Sciences. Congress created the NBES in 2002 to advise the Education Department on its research and statistical work. The NBES is mandated to determine whether the department’s “technical and scientific peer review” process is sound, whether its research is “scientifically valid,” and whether its activities “are objective, secular, neutral, and nonideological.” Given this administration’s resurrection of Obama-era departmental guidance and regulations on divisive issues—such as threatening schools with civil-rights investigations based on racial disparities in suspension and expulsion rates—objective research based on sound statistics is more important than ever.<br />But the department is preventing the NBES from evaluating the new policies. Until the new members are seated, the board lacks a quorum and can’t meet. That’s where Marbury v. Madison comes in.<br />Like Marbury, our case starts with a refusal to deliver presidential commissions. White House officials notified us in early January that the president had signed and the secretary of state had processed our commissions. With that, we became federal officers. But the Education Department won’t deliver the commissions or even acknowledge their existence.<br />In 1801 President John Adams signed William Marbury’s commission as a justice of the peace, but Thomas Jefferson became president before Marbury’s commission had been delivered. Jefferson and Secretary of State James Madison refused to recognize Marbury’s appointment and deliver his commission. In a decision written by Chief Justice John Marshall, the high court found that Adams’s signature had made Marbury’s appointment final and that refusal to deliver the commission was “violative of a vested legal right.”</td>

      <td>Old-fashioned phones taught us to be patient and to appreciate the advances our kids take for granted.</td>
      <td>‘If I were permitted one phone call,” my 18-year old daughter, Molly, recently told me, “and my life depended on that person picking up, I’d call you.” How nice, I thought, but she wasn’t finished: “Not mom.” Ouch.<br />Sure, I tend to pick up more often than Devin, my wife, does, especially when it’s family calling. But unlike my daughter, I don’t assume I’m being screened whenever my call goes directly to voice mail. In fact, I don’t mind at all.<br />I can’t blame Molly, or any other digital native who grew up with the instant-gratification expectations that smartphones engender. These cherubic callers simply have never experienced frontier justice as administered by the busy signal.<br />For them, the options have always been a successful conversation or a shot at voice mail. By contrast, most peak-hour calls made in my 1980s adolescence resulted in the dreaded busy signal, telephony’s equivalent of being told “Ask Again Later” by the then-popular Magic 8-Ball.<br />The busy signal wouldn’t have put you through to voice mail even if the technology had existed. The busy signal didn’t care if you were the queen of England. The busy signal told you someone had beaten you to the punch, plain and simple. The busy signal was bigger than you.</td>

      <td>He’s not chief justice, but never before has he had the power and influence he has now.</td>
      <td>For Clarence Thomas, any chance he might become chief justice has long since passed. But at 72, he is coming into his own. For circumstances have now made it as plausible to speak of the Thomas court as the Roberts court.<br />The trigger was the replacement of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Justice Amy Coney Barrett. This move gave conservatives a 6-3 majority, depriving Chief Justice John Roberts of the ability to swing decisions to the liberal side—unless he manages to bring Brett Kavanaugh along undefinedwith him.<br />This gives Justice Kavanaugh Joe Manchin-like powers over any case in which the chief might go south on his more conservative-minded colleagues. It’s a big change from the days when Justice Anthony Kennedy could easily move back and forth, here siding with conservatives to strike down speech limits in Citizens United v. FEC (2010), and there unearthing in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) a constitutional right for gay couples to marry.<br />For a while, Chief Justice Roberts looked as though he might become the new Anthony Kennedy. The chief pulled his own Kennedy in 2012, even before Justice Kennedy retired, when he saved ObamaCare by ruling that the individual mandate was a tax and thus constitutional. He has sided with the court’s liberal wing on other cases too, such as when he blocked the Trump administration’s bid to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. At the same time, the Roberts court has lately been shy to take up contentious issues from abortion to gun rights.<br />Enter Clarence Thomas. As Jan Crawford Greenburg noted in her 2007 book, “Supreme Conflict,” for many years Justice Thomas has been dismissed unfairly as Antonin Scalia’s sidekick. In fact, the men weren’t only brothers-in-arms but brothers—just listen to Justice Thomas’s tremendous eulogy for Scalia—whose significant disagreements on issues from natural law to deference to precedent helped each hone his own position while increasing their mutual respect.</td>

      <td>Anti-Semitic violence is un-American and threatens Biden’s Mideast agenda.</td>
      <td>The Gaza war spilled into America last week as some pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas demonstrators crossed the line separating protest from mob violence in several U.S. cities.<br />Past anti-Jewish violence in America has generally come in one of three forms. It has either been perpetrated by a deranged individual like in the 2018 shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, by an outgrowth of communal tensions as in the 1991 Crown Heights riots, or by an attack on a particular Jewish individual such as the 1915 lynching of Leo Frank.<br />Last week brought something different: Mobs visited widespread violence on random Jews, or in some cases “Jewish-looking” non-Jews. The targets have no responsibility for Israeli policy. Given the policy preferences of U.S. Jews documented in polling, many were likely anti-Trump, anti-Netanyahu, critical of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and pro-Black Lives Matter. None of this meant anything to the mob. All the attackers seemed to care about was that their victims were, or looked, Jewish. That was enough.<br />Nothing about last week’s violence would have surprised Theodor Herzl, architect of the Zionist movement. The core insight that drove Herzl into Zionism was that though the ideals of the liberal enlightenment were beautiful and appealing, European Jews would perish horribly if they entrusted their fate to them. Many Israelis—whether descended from Holocaust survivors, Jews expelled or fleeing persecution and discrimination across the Middle East, or Jews who endured oppression and discrimination in the Soviet Union—believe from familial and personal experience that Herzl got it right.<br />Americans have tried to build a country that could prove Herzl wrong. The U.S. has sought to form a national identity that transcends race and tribe, in which anyone—including Jewish Americans and Palestinian-Americans—can be truly at home and as American as apple pie. The country isn’t there yet, but many of us want to keep trying.</td>

      <td>Fifty years have passed since President Nixon declared war on cancer in his 1971 State of the Union address: “The time has come in America when the same kind of concentrated effort that . . . took man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this dread disease.” Today we are closer than ever to that goal.<br />Cancer killed 10 million people world-wide last year, and doctors diagnosed 19 million new cases. Yet scientists have made startling progress in understanding, preventing and treating it. “I’ve had an oncologist tell me that this is a very exciting time to have cancer,” a medical journalist quipped this month at the Fifth International Vatican Conference, an annual gathering of medical, scientific and religious experts. Panelists described progress on many fronts in the battle against cancer:<br />• New vaccines against human papillomavirus, which causes cervical and throat cancer, are in late-stage trials. Scientists are also testing vaccines for melanoma, leukemia, lung and renal cancers.<br />• In five years there may be a simple blood test costing less than $500 that can detect 70% of all cancers in the earliest stages. When patients with breast, prostate and thyroid cancer spot the disease early, their five-year survival rate is 99%.<br />• New Crispr gene-editing technology deploys a molecular defense system borrowed from bacteria, which use this system to kill invading viral cells by unzippering their DNA to rip it apart. Scientists are using Crispr to repair or rewrite flawed genes. The therapy cured sickle-cell anemia in the first three patients to receive it, and soon it will take on cancer. Many trials of Crispr therapies in the U.S. now are in phase 2 for leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma and more. In China, Crispr is showing promise against lung cancer.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The National Guard, deployed to secure the U.S. Capitol in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack by a pro-Trump mob, will end its mission there Wednesday, the Pentagon said.<br />The troops began arriving at the Capitol hours after Trump supporters breached the Capitol building while Congress was certifying the election of President Biden. The number of troops at one point peaked at 26,000, representing all 50 states, three territories and the District of Columbia. Their strength has been gradually reduced, and roughly 1,600 members remain at the complex, where the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives meet and have office space.<br />The Pentagon hasn’t provided an updated cost estimate since March, when it said it had spent $521 million. Although the soldiers are leaving, officials have warned that the hardened security measures around the Capitol would remain.<br />“They will not be able to return immediately to the open campus where people can openly visit the Capitol because of the strain on the Capitol Police,” said Ret. Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who conducted a security review following the riots, Sunday on CBS.<br />The Capitol Police twice requested the National Guard to extend its mission around the Capitol. The force asked the Guard to stay past March 4, for instance, the date of the presidential inauguration day until the 1930s. Law-enforcement officials feared another mob could gather and attack the Capitol on that date.</td>
