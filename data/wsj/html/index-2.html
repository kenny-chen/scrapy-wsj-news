      <td>Marked for stardom since childhood, the Brazilian playmaker was long seen as a potential successor to Messi and Ronaldo, but never completely delivered</td>
      <td>PARIS—Ever since Neymar was a spiky-haired teenager in southern Brazil, large swathes of the soccer economy have been invested in making him a superstar.<br />He was the prodigy who shot to fame with Santos, before two of the richest clubs on the planet spent hundreds of millions of dollars to secure his services. He had a major  Nike  endorsement that put his face on billboards around the planet. And he was the face of Brazil’s home World Cup in 2014 and the Rio Olympics two years later.<br />But in 2020, Nike parted with its one-time golden boy following an allegation by a Nike employee that he had sexually assaulted her on a promotional trip to New York,  according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Neymar denies the allegation, which is false, a spokeswoman said.<br />Soccer clubs, sponsors, and officials around the world long viewed Neymar as the heir apparent to the game’s reigning kings, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. That much was confirmed in 2017 as Neymar became the most expensive player in soccer history. Paris Saint-Germain had paid FC Barcelona $262 million for his contract, more than doubling the previous world transfer record.<br />Yet for all the hype that has surrounded him since childhood, Neymar, now 29, has never quite cleared the impossibly high bar that was set for him.</td>

The strong start to its business year comes after Dell, in February, reported record full-year revenue.<br />Personal-computer sales registered their strongest growth in a decade last year, underscoring a shift from mobile devices brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, according to industry data. PC shipments overall rose 13% in 2020 and are expected to increase 18% in 2021 despite the semiconductor shortage, according to International Data Corp.<br />“We continue to see very strong demand on the consumer side, and the demand on the commercial side is also starting to strengthen as offices reopen,” said HP Chief Executive Enrique Lores.<br />HP expects personal computers to remain a hot item into next year, he said Thursday, as the company posted a roughly 27% jump in second-quarter revenue and raised its full-year earnings outlook. Consumer sales increased strongly, rising 72% in the computer business and 77% in the printing segment, the company said.</td>

      <td>Americans will celebrate independence from Covid-19 on July 4. We got a sneak peek when Phil Mickelson won the PGA Championship and was surrounded by adoring fans enjoying their post-Covid freedoms.<br />But U.S. citizens residing overseas are not able to share in this optimism. The U.S. government has no plan to provide vaccinations to Americans who don’t reside in the U.S. It was the right thing for the U.S. government to prioritize vaccinating all people in America, but now that vaccine supply exceeds demand at home, it is time for Americans abroad to be given their shots.<br />The U.S. government has rarely offered vaccinations to Americans residing overseas. But this is the first time at least since the eradication of smallpox that the U.S. government has offered free vaccines to everyone in America, whether citizens, residents or visitors. Americans living overseas are U.S. taxpayers and should have the same access to free vaccines funded by their tax dollars.<br />There are no significant hurdles for the U.S. government to ship Covid vaccines around the world and administer them to Americans living abroad. The State Department confirmed on April 20 that it has sent to each U.S. embassy sufficient vaccines to administer to all American employees. Each embassy also maintains a list of Americans who have registered their contact details, and unregistered Americans could easily be reached through the American communities in each country. All that would be required to administer vaccines in an orderly manner to Americans overseas would be to create an online sign-up system.<br />While the virus has recently receded in the U.S. and Europe, it has spiked in countries in the Indo-Pacific. Many countries in that region have been slow in delivering vaccines to their populations. In Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, less than 6% of the population has been fully vaccinated. The rates in the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam are even lower. Some governments are prioritizing their citizens over foreign residents, and in some countries the only available vaccines are ones that haven’t been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, such as  AstraZeneca  and Sinovac.</td>

The facility made vaccine substance and finished vaccine doses for J&J and  AstraZeneca  PLC.<br />Emergent chief executive Robert Kramer told a House committee last week that the company had produced enough of a key ingredient to yield more than 100 million doses of the J&J vaccine.<br />The company has been taking corrective measures and been in talks with FDA and J&J over the steps needed to reopen the facility.<br />Johnson & Johnson said it is working with Emergent to secure “as quickly as possible emergency-use-authorization in the U.S. for Covid-19 drug substance manufactured at Emergent Bayview.”</td>

      <td>The country used a low corporate rate to become a Celtic tiger. That’s why it opposes the U.S. global minimum tax.</td>
      <td>Ireland threw a wrench this week in the Biden Treasury’s plans for a new global minimum tax. “I absolutely support and will be making the case for our 12.5% tax rate,” Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said regarding the global negotiations. He has “significant reservations” about setting a higher minimum rate.<br />Democrats want a high global minimum tax that would end national tax competition and reduce the harm from their huge tax increase on U.S. business. But tax competition has been a boon to global growth and investment, as Ireland’s famous low-tax policy makes clear. Far from a “race to the bottom,” Ireland adopted policies that were ahead of their time and helped its economy grow from a backwater into a Celtic tiger.<br />It might surprise you to learn that Ireland’s recent tax history includes raising rates on some activities. The story starts in the 1950s when Dublin adopted a zero tax rate on exporting businesses and companies in a special economic zone near Shannon. Those tax breaks were explicit subsidies, in an era when many governments used targeted tax breaks to steer their economies.<br />But in the 1970s, when Ireland joined what later became the European Union, the bloc’s rules prohibited such blatant export subsidies. Dublin at first responded by playing the same game as other European giants—offer tax subsidies but less aggressively. Ireland raised the corporate rate on manufacturers to 10%, compared to a rate for everyone else that sometimes hit 50%. Over time Dublin expanded that preferential rate to other industries such as financial services.<br />The impending phase-out of those tax subsidies in the late 1990s under an EU mandate led Dublin to think again. And it pioneered a new strategy: Apply the same low tax rate to every business. Policy makers settled on 12.5%, which was a tax increase for some companies but a cut for others. This was a classic flat-tax reform, and from then on Dublin was out of the tax-subsidy business.</td>

      <td>Costco Wholesale Corp.  said demand surged in its latest quarter as the U.S. economy began to rev up, but the club-store chain warned it is facing higher costs for everything from workers to imported cheese.<br />The company on Thursday said it generated $45.28 billion in revenue for its quarter that ended May 9, up almost 22% from the same period last year. Analysts had predicted the chain would report $43.65 billion in revenue.<br />Costco has seen price increases in part because suppliers are paying more for containers and shipping as demand rises, finance chief Richard Galanti said. Expenses for paper goods, apparel and plastic items like cups and plants are up, as are costs for fresh meats and imported cheeses.<br />In March, the company estimated inflation was rising in the 1% to 1.5% range, but now it thinks it is up 2.5% to 3.5%, excluding gasoline sales, he said. Higher costs could put pressure on Costco’s margins.<br />“Inflationary factors abound,” Mr. Galanti told investors. The company is pushing to control costs and manage supply-chain pressures, including by purchasing inventory early, he said.</td>

Answer: When Democratic government authorities give permission.<br />Witness  Facebook ’s  decision to stop censoring some claims about the origin of Covid-19 the same day President Biden said his Administration will investigate whether a Chinese lab may have been involved.<br />It’s been clear for more than a year that the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which collects and tests coronaviruses, deserved scrutiny over the emergence of the pandemic in Wuhan. Yet Facebook announced in February that it would expand its content moderation on Covid-19 to include “false” and “debunked” claims such as that “COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured.” Facebook deployed fact-check warnings against an influential Medium post this month on the origins of the virus by science journalist Nicholas Wade.<br />As long as Democratic opinion sneered at the lab-leak theory, Facebook dutifully controlled it. But ideological bubbles have a way of bursting, and the circumstantial evidence—most of which has been available for months—finally permeated the insular world of progressive public health. This prompted officials like Anthony Fauci to say more investigation is needed, while the White House issued new intelligence directives reflecting lower certainty of a natural emergence.<br />Facebook acted in lockstep with the government: “In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of COVID-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps,” it said Wednesday.</td>

That’s Japan’s decision, but the U.S. can do more to help its ally.<br />A Monday State Department travel advisory, citing Covid-19 cases in Japan, urged Americans to avoid travel to the country. This won’t have much practical effect, but it sends the wrong message as Japan begins to welcome tens of thousands of athletes and officials to the country ahead of the Olympics.<br />Tokyo and several other Japanese prefectures are in a state of emergency, and some hospitals are under serious strain. Yet the country of 125 million has suffered fewer than 13,000 Covid-19 deaths. Over the previous week Japan reported a daily average of 109 deaths and nearly 5,000 new cases.<br />Japan has fared well compared with the U.S. and Europe during the pandemic, but it has fallen behind on vaccination. That’s dangerous in Japan, where more than 29% of the country is age 65 or older. Only 5.2% had received at least one vaccine dose, with 2.3% fully vaccinated as of May 24.<br />Many Japanese fear that opening up now will lead to the import of more Covid-19 variants. Some 83% of Japanese want to cancel or delay the Olympics, an Asahi newspaper survey found this month. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, whose approval rating has sunk to barely above 30%, has vowed to hold the Olympics—and to vaccinate the country’s elderly population by the end of July.</td>

      <td>Progressives know they can’t pass their ambition to eliminate fossil fuels through Congress in open debate. So they’re doing it by degrees and in relative stealth via regulation across the economy. Consider President Biden’s executive order this month that conscripts the financial system in the climate cause.<br />“The intensifying impacts of climate change present physical risk to assets, publicly traded securities, private investments, and companies” as well as a “transition risk” from a shift away from fossil fuels, the order says. The goal of Mr. Biden’s many other climate regulations, such as electric-car mandates, is to make fossil-fuels obsolete, and he wants financial regulators to order private capital to assist.<br />National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the White House budget director are directed to measure climate risk to federal programs, assets and liabilities.<br />“The Federal Government has broad exposure to increased costs and lost revenue as a result of the impacts of unmitigated climate change,” the executive order says. This is almost comic when you consider the fiscal risks of Mr. Biden’s $6 trillion in actual and proposed new spending, much of which is for subsidizing non-economic investments in green energy. Think Solyndra or Fisker Automotive.<br />Mr. Biden’s four horsemen of the climate apocalypse will “quantify climate risk within the economic assumptions and the long-term budget projections of the President’s Budget.” They will also analyze the “financing needs” to achieve Mr. Biden’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and limit “global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.”</td>

      <td>The central bank is likely to have trouble taming prices without hurting the real economy.</td>
      <td>If you’ve worried that the Federal Reserve would wait too long to address inflation concerns, you can take comfort from recent statements by members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee suggesting they might eventually be willing to shift away from easy-money policies. The problem is that the instruments in the Fed’s toolbox for lifting rates are potentially more harmful than they once were—and using them is likely to induce pangs of regret.<br />The Fed’s traditional tools—the discount rate, reserve requirements and open market operations—have evolved into considerably different mechanisms since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Fed now relies on its ability to pay interest on the reserves held by banks as its primary means for conducting monetary policy versus more subtle techniques for influencing supply and demand for reserves through open market operations. The Fed has also become a massive player in the market for U.S. government debt, which gives it a significant impact on the demand for Treasury securities, affecting prices and yields across maturities.<br />Considering that excess bank reserves held in depository accounts at the Fed grew from less than $2 billion in August 2008 to more than $3.8 trillion currently, and that Fed holdings of Treasury securities increased over the same period from less than $500 billion to more than $5 trillion, it is clear the Fed’s clout has risen enormously. Its earlier holdings equaled about 5% of total U.S. government debt; its current holdings are 18%.<br />It seems almost quaint to recall the days when contractionary monetary policy meant the Fed’s attempts to raise the interest rate at which banks loaned excess reserves to each other—called the federal-funds rate—by selling relatively meager amounts of Treasury debt at prices slightly below the going market price to increase yields.<br />The whole thing worked only because banks actively sought to avoid keeping excess reserves in Fed depository accounts that paid no interest; they much preferred to make profitable loans to the private sector. If a bank purchased Treasury debt from the Fed, its reserve account was debited for the amount, reducing the total supply of reserves—putting upward pressure on the fed-funds rate. As that rate increased, so did other interest rates.</td>

      <td>More than 3,000 children never saw their parents again. On Jan. 6, Congress returned within hours.</td>
      <td>Democratic lawmakers want to establish a “9/11-style commission” to investigate the siege of the Capitol on Jan. 6. “I would like to see Jan. 6 burned into the American mind as firmly as 9/11, because it was that scale of a shock to the system,” commentator George Will said recently. The attempt to reconfigure the “domestic terrorist” narrative to fit the horrifying story of Sept. 11 is profoundly disheartening. These two events are fundamentally different in nature, scope and consequences. Mentioning them in the same breath not only diminishes the horror of what happened on 9/11; it tells a false story to the generation of Americans who are too young to remember that day nearly 20 years ago.<br />My brother, Charles “Chic” Burlingame, was the pilot of American Airlines flight 77. He was murdered in his cockpit at age 51 in a 6½-minute struggle for control of the airplane. Here is what I want these young people to know:<br />Members of Congress might have had a frightening day on Jan. 6, but on 9/11 some 200 people in the World Trade Center towers chose to jump from 80 to 100 floors above the ground rather than be consumed by fire. A woman waiting at a lobby elevator bank was burned over 82% of her body when jet fuel from the first plane sent a ball of fire down the elevator shaft and into the lobby. She spent three months in a hospital burn unit and was permanently disfigured.<br />There are countless harrowing stories like this—of death, destruction and heartbreaking loss. More than 3,000 children lost parents. Eight young children were killed on the planes. Recovery personnel found 19,000 human remains scattered all over lower Manhattan from river to river, including on rooftops and window ledges. Victims’ remains were still being recovered years later by utility workers and construction crews. Some families received so many notifications of remains that they couldn’t take it any more and asked for them to stop. More than 1,100 families received nothing. Their loved ones went to work that morning and disappeared.<br />The attack brought down our nationwide aviation system, shut down the New York Stock Exchange for days, destroyed or rendered uninhabitable 16 acres of Lower Manhattan including underground subway and commuter train lines and destroyed a section of the Pentagon. Rebuilding at ground zero is still incomplete, and U.S. troops are still in Afghanistan.</td>

      <td>Baltimore’s Bishop John Carroll was the father of America’s Catholic Church.</td>
      <td>Baltimore’s Bishop John Carroll had a decision to make. It was 1805, and the diocese then encompassed the entire U.S. Years before, Pope Pius VI had urged Carroll to build a cathedral church. But what kind of building would it be? And what would it say about American Catholics? His choice would set American Catholicism’s tone for years to come.<br />Carroll spent decades at the nexus of Catholic and U.S. history. He was the new republic’s first Catholic bishop, appointed in 1789, and a second cousin of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the sole Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence. The cathedral would have to be deeply Catholic and unmistakably American.<br />Eventually the bishop raised enough funds and acquired property on a prominent hill overlooking Baltimore harbor. He rejected a modest Gothic design and adopted an ambitious plan devised by Benjamin Latrobe, son of a Moravian minister and an architect of the Capitol, then being built.<br />Latrobe’s design took 15 years to execute. The cathedral’s unfinished stone walls were conscripted as Baltimore’s last line of defense during the War of 1812, and Carroll died in 1815, too early to see it completed. But when the Cathedral of the Assumption was finally dedicated on May 31, 1821, it was clear that he had made the right decision. Thanks to Latrobe’s genius in refracting light through the skylights and oculus of the structure’s classical dome, the luminescence of America’s first cathedral bespoke the Catholic commitment to the religious freedom proclaimed in the First Amendment.<br />Two hundred years later, this extraordinary building is more than a masterpiece of Federal-style architecture. It is the center of an innovative urban mission in one of America’s most troubled cities, and it is an unparalleled historical site: the place where more U.S. Catholic history was made than at any other.</td>

      <td>Was it the oil crisis that slammed the brakes on U.S. automakers? Or a wave of regulation?</td>
      <td>Charles E. Wilson, the former General Motors president who served as secretary of defense under Dwight Eisenhower, was asked at his 1953 Senate confirmation hearing how he would handle potential conflicts between the country’s interests and the company’s. Wilson found such conflicts inconceivable: Surely “what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.”<br />So it once seemed. Kenneth Whyte’s vigorous, provocative book “The Sack of Detroit: General Motors and the End of American Enterprise” begins with the economic transformation in the decades after Henry Ford introduced his Model T. By 1958, the top 10 companies on the Fortune 500 list were all “car manufacturers or producers of steel or fuel for cars,” Mr. Whyte observes. Detroit had become home to the so-called Big Three: Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, or GM. The possibilities for growth appeared limitless.<br />More recently, however, American car makers have been running on fumes. The industry’s decline is usually dated to the 1973 oil embargo, which prompted many drivers to choose small, fuel-efficient imports over gas-guzzling domestic models. But Mr. Whyte, founding editor of Canada’s National Post and the author of biographies of Herbert Hoover and William Randolph Hearst, tells another story. He argues that Detroit’s troubles began earlier, when consumer advocates prompted the federal government to hit auto makers with onerous regulations. The industry was “sacked in 1966 by a well-educated, well-placed, suit-and-tie-wearing band of crusaders united by a determination to knock automakers and the whole of corporate America down a peg and make them pay,” Mr. Whyte declares. “They brought to its knees the greatest industrial enterprise in human history.”<br />For decades, traffic safety was governed by the “Triple-E strategy”: educating drivers, enforcing traffic laws and engineering safe roads. According to Mr. Whyte, this approach was successful—but not successful enough: In the 1950s, auto accidents were still claiming more than 30,000 American lives annually. By then, new research suggested that the problem was not the initial impact of a driver crashing a car but a “second collision” of a human body slamming against a dangerous car interior.<br />This research captured the imagination of Harvard Law student Ralph Nader, who became convinced that car manufacturers were the real culprits. His 1965 bestseller “Unsafe at Any Speed” singled out the rear-engine design of the Chevrolet Corvair, a compact car that GM had introduced to compete with smaller imports and that was the target of a barrage of personal-injury lawsuits.</td>

      <td>John Krasinski directs Emily Blunt in the sequel to their 2018 horror movie about a post-apocalyptic world in which the slightest noise could lead to sudden death.</td>
      <td>‘A Quiet Place Part II” was supposed to hit the multiplexes immediately after its world premiere in New York in March 2020, but the film went back on the shelf to wait out the pandemic, rather than become streaming fodder.<br />A good thing, too—it’s worthy of the big screen. Speaking professionally, I should note that no sequel could have been as distinctive as the 2018 original, a horror thriller with a powerfully dramatic premise  and fully developed characters. This follow-up offers the solid satisfactions of suspense and intensity without the delight of discovery. Speaking personally, though, I feel compelled to note that the critics screening was my first time in a movie theater since the Covid-19 shutdown, and I was so excited to be there, so gobsmacked by the enormous images and immense sounds—and eerie silences—that I may not be the most objective judge of the production’s ultimate worth.<br />The action begins just after the first film ends. The surviving members of the Abbott family are visibly older—mainly the sister, Regan (Millicent Simmonds), and her kid brother, Marcus (Noah Jupe)—but nothing is made of that, which is perfectly fine. We’re quickly caught up in the plight of the siblings, their mother, Evelyn (Emily Blunt), and Evelyn’s newborn son, after a brisk and gripping preface takes us back to the onset of the post-apocalyptic plague—blind monsters who listen for the slightest sound, then devour the hapless human who made it.<br />The husband and father, Lee (John Krasinski), figures in the preface, but it’s our only chance to see him again. Lee previously gave his life for his family, and in this story dead means dead—none of those time-warpy resurrections that occasionally occur in superhero franchises. Now it’s up to the materfamilias to keep everyone safe from hideous harm in this once-picturesque rural corner of New York state. But Evelyn gets more help from Regan than she could have imagined. Among the movie’s many good ideas executed well, the one really fine idea is transforming the already brave and resourceful deaf daughter into a full-fledged action heroine, a role for which Ms. Simmonds, deaf in real life, turns out to be impressively suited. That decision is thanks to Mr. Krasinski, who directed, as before, but this time from his own screenplay, rather than a joint effort with Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, his collaborators on the previous script.<br />“I can save us,” Regan signs to her mother, and your heart goes with her as she marches off into the wilderness, cochlear implant in place and shotgun on her shoulder, determined to find the source of a song emanating from a radio station on an offshore island. But why would a deaf girl, however brave, choose to follow the siren call of a golden oldie? Because, I can tell you without spoiling your viewing pleasure—I mean your theater-attending pleasure—Regan takes the song, “Beyond the Sea,” to be not just any random anthem on a loop at some abandoned station but a code, or specific signal, suggesting that other remnants of civilization are still out there, waiting to be discovered. (Along the way she is joined, not always supportively, by one of her father’s friends, Emmett; he’s played with gusto and sporadic glee by the always excellent Cillian Murphy.)</td>

      <td>After two decades away from solving crimes, a forensic psychiatrist played by Rebecca Gibney finds herself called upon to help catch a serial murderer in Melbourne.</td>
      <td>It’s been 20 years since forensic psychiatrist Jane Halifax (Rebecca Gibney) has worked with police as she’s called on to do in “Halifax: Retribution.” The citizens of Melbourne, Australia, are suffering the growing menace of a sniper—a killer who never misses his targets. That those targets are chosen at random is all the more cause for the terror he inflicts on this city, whose law-enforcement establishment quickly realizes its need for expert help of the kind Jane can provide, however reluctantly. Not only has she been leading a satisfying life as an academic, she’s recently had a tormenting personal loss of her own. She’s nevertheless incapable of rejecting the call of duty in an emergency of this magnitude, particularly one awash in as many mysteries as this one. And as much carnage, colorfully delivered—one of the distinguishing features of this eight-part series. Even conversations among police officers end with somebody getting a bullet in the head.<br /><br />There are, however, distinctive features of a more complex kind in this tale, among them its lack—relatively speaking—of clichéd characters and circumstances. It’s a story that can boast, as well, of a skepticism about high-minded idealists—a kind that turns out to be in the end not terribly nuanced in its picture of the lethal self-righteousness at the heart of a certain kind of obsessiveness with the need to reform society. A picture that suggests, in the end, a connection between that kind of obsession in its extreme forms and a certain degree of mental derangement.<br />There’s no mistaking that the most objectionable—and most dangerous—characters here are those claiming they’ve been driven by devotion to the highest principles. Among them, their determination to right the wrongs of governments that victimize people through the machinery of surveillance: a crime, in the view of certain of the criminals in this saga, that cries out for attention to be paid—which, one of them apparently feels, can be achieved only by repeated acts of murder.<br />A crisply authoritative professional, Jane stands somewhat apart from the police in her ability to establish personal connections with wanted criminals. It’s how she manages to get herself into close quarters with one of the most dangerous of these—which makes for scenes impressively freighted with tension. Not that anyone can imagine she won’t be able to escape, with every hair still in place. Jane has, in addition, a strong support unit in her police colleagues, led by Tom Saracen (Anthony LaPaglia)—a force employed to shadow her every move into dangerous territory.</td>

      <td>From its first chaotic scene to its last, ”HouseBroken,” an animated Fox show involving a therapist and a bunch of neighborhood animals in treatment, seems a concept that was destined to make its way into the world. That it’s a good thing that this one did is clear at once, as we confront, in this highly engaging series, a riot of creatures great and small competing for the attention of the show’s star, who is, naturally enough, the group’s therapist. She’s a standard poodle (expertly voiced by Lisa Kudrow) who will brook no disrespect for the disciplines of psychotherapy, not even from a patient called Diablo (Tony Hale), who is decidedly more civilized, as dogs go, than his name implies.<br />The relationships between the patients are smooth enough—it’s the therapist, clearly doing her all to please the group, who manages to raise hackles. Having assured one client that she’s not a bad dog, the therapist receives a snippy retort complaining about good-dog, bad-dog distinctions. There are also complaints, by a different patient, about being “triggered”—a noteworthy charge, and by now a familiar one, which some time ago began gaining currency among college students claiming to have suffered from exposure to literature, or history, that made them “uncomfortable.” All of the many moments involving language complaints in this genial work approximate the real world’s preoccupation with the latest forbidden term, the latest outrage against the rulebook of sensitive speech. How did they get into this playful series? They’re in the air is the answer, the voice of the culture.</td>

      <td>‘Cruella,” playing in theaters, provides the answer to a question that no one outside Walt Disney Pictures ever felt compelled to ask: Who was Cruella de Vil before she got to be so cruel? See this live-action prequel to the “101 Dalmatians” franchise as a fashion show if you must see it at all—the setting is mainly punk-rock London in the 1970s, with smashing costumes designed by Jenny Beavan. Otherwise it’s a lifeless slog, and, with a running time of 134 minutes, a cruelly elongated one.<br />Emma Stone is Estella, a gifted orphan who dreams of becoming a fashion designer, not a thief. (Estella at age 12 is played by Tipper Seifert-Cleveland in a short, inert prequel to the prequel.) Ms. Stone first revealed her gift for comedy more than a decade ago in such films as “Zombieland” and “Easy A,” but she’s betrayed by the style and ponderous pace of this one, which was directed by Craig Gillespie (“Lars and the Real Girl”) from a screenplay by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara. Every joke is leaned on, as if it were some Shavian gem; every pregnant pause eventually aborts.<br />The London of Estella’s early adventures is Dickensian in flavor. As a wild young woman and a shameless grifter, she acquires a couple of partners in petty crime, both of them recycled from earlier films in the franchise: clever Jasper (Joel Fry, who’s genuinely witty in the role) and hapless Horace (Paul Walter Hauser, burdened by an excess of buffoonery). But the story doesn’t coalesce—to the extent that anything in the rattletrap narrative ever comes together—until the heroine gets a job at a fashionable department store. That’s when she shows her designer chops and crosses paths, then swords, with her boss, Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson), who’s a legend in the world of haute couture and not just tyrannical toward Estella but really, truly cruel. Ms. Thompson, too, falls afoul of the film’s mirthless style, though it isn’t her fault. Almost everyone on screen is, or becomes, unpleasant. If nothing else, “Cruella” is a radical departure for Disney’s gladness merchants.<br />Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com</td>

      <td>Now it can be told? President Joe Biden has been saying over and over since he was merely a candidate for the nation’s highest office that his tax increases would only target corporations and rich people. The line was always disingenuous because even his old boss President Barack Obamaacknowledged that workers suffer when corporate income tax rates rise. But now the New York Times is reporting that President Biden plans to support a direct tax increase on Americans who are not at all wealthy.<br />Jim Tankersleyreports in the Times that the paper has obtained Biden budget documents and that “the documents forecast that Mr. Biden and Congress will allow tax cuts for low- and middle-income Americans, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in 2017, to expire as scheduled in 2025.”<br />Granted this is the Times, so readers should be skeptical. But Mr. Tankersley’s account does offer a plausible explanation for why the White House budget team and the Biden Treasury would be looking to shake revenue out of every available American taxpayer:<br />Federal spending in the World War II era allowed the United States to save Western civilization by defeating Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.  The Biden spending plan will subsidize daycare and electric cars, among other political desires. Unclear is what the U.S. will do in the tragic event it has to fund victory in a world war again.<br />But it does seem clear that taxpayers are being drafted to support a much larger government—almost akin to a permanent Covid emergency.

      <td>Leaders of six biggest U.S. banks, testifying to Congress Thursday, each warned against a retroactive change to the capital-gains tax</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden’s expected $6 trillion budget assumes that his proposed capital-gains tax rate increase took effect in late April, meaning that it would already be too late for high-income investors to realize gains at the lower tax rates if Congress agrees, according to two people familiar with the proposal.<br />Mr. Biden’s plan would raise the top tax rate on capital gains to 43.4% from 23.8% for households with income over $1 million. He would also change the tax rules for unrealized capital gains held until death.<br />The effective date for the capital-gains tax rate increase would be tied to Mr. Biden’s announcement of the tax increase as part of his American Families Plan, which includes an expanded child tax credit and funding for preschool and community college. He detailed the plan April 28, and the budget will be released Friday. White House representatives didn’t immediately comment.<br />Congress must still approve any rate changes and retroactive effective dates, and there is already wariness about the full capital-gains tax plan building among some congressional Democrats.<br />Some, such as Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), have said they want to maintain a lower tax rate for capital gains than for ordinary income. And lawmakers from farm states, including Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.) and Rep. Cindy Axne (D., Iowa) have objected to the changes on capital gains at death.</td>

      <td>New research shows that the biggest effect of early education isn’t on children’s test scores but on their resilience as teenagers and adults</td>
      <td>Psychologist Alison Gopnik explores new discoveries in the science of human nature. Read previous columns here.<br />Does preschool help children become more successful adults? Twenty-five years ago, I thought that there wouldn’t be a straightforward answer to this question—development is just too complicated and hard to study. I was completely wrong. A clever and compelling study by the economists Guthrie Gray-Lobe, Parag Pathak and Christopher Walters has just appeared as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, and the answer is clearly “yes.” But the results also raise fascinating questions about how early experience influences later life.<br />In defense of my earlier view, development is, in fact, complicated and hard to study. How can we tell that there aren’t other differences between children who go to preschool and those who don’t? There are so many different kinds of preschool programs, so many different measures of success and so many other things that happen to children as they grow up. Wouldn’t early effects just wash out later on?<br />Some of these problems have been reflected in policy debates. Early studies of big public programs, particularly Head Start, found that children’s grades and test scores improved at first, but the effects faded out in elementary school. On the other hand, some more controlled and longer-term studies found that children who attended preschool were healthier and wealthier many years later. But these studies looked at experimental, relatively small interventions, like the Perry Preschool Program in Ypsilanti, Mich.<br />In the new study, the researchers looked at both the short- and the long-term effects of a big public preschool program, and they took advantage of a remarkable natural experiment. In 1997, Boston decided to offer free universal preschool, but since there were more applicants than places, they used a lottery to decide who would get in. The result was the equivalent of a randomized, controlled trial—the scientific gold standard for determining cause and effect.

      <td>Partners at Base10 to donate half of carried interest from latest fund for student scholarships</td>
      <td>After years of promises from the venture-capital industry to invest in more startup founders of color, one firm is taking a novel approach: sharing their investment profits with students at predominantly Black universities.<br />San Francisco-based Base10 Partners said Thursday it has raised a $250 million venture fund to invest in tech companies, and that a portion of the profit from that fund would be given to historically Black colleges and universities to fund student scholarships, with a focus on majors relevant to a career in tech.<br />Venture-capital partners typically claim carried interest—a share of a fund’s profit—as a large part of their income. Base10 partners said they will forgo half of their carried interest—which is 20%—and donate it for scholarships and other forms of financial aid for students at HBCUs.<br />Base10 Partners, founded in 2017, is the largest Black-led venture capital firm in the country. About $50 million of the new fund came from HBCUs themselves through their endowments, said Adeyemi Ajao, Base10 co-founder and managing partner.<br />HBCU endowments are about half the size of those of other schools, according to a government report from 2018. That has limited their involvement in venture-capital funds, which can be lucrative but highly risky investments, said Mr. Ajao. Base10 said it welcomed smaller-than-typical check sizes from the HBCUs and waived fees for them. By creating a pipeline for more HBCUs to engage with venture capital, and more Black students to get a start in tech, Base10 hopes to begin to expand opportunities and support for underrepresented minorities in Silicon Valley.</td>

      <td>Massachusetts court turns down brokerage’s request for a preliminary injunction in a regulatory action over its duties to investors</td>
      <td>A Massachusetts judge on Thursday gave state securities regulators a green light to proceed with their case against Robinhood Financial LLC, ruling that it wouldn’t be in the public interest to block an administrative hearing on allegations that the online brokerage doesn’t protect inexperienced investors.<br />Robinhood, the zero-commission trading platform that has exploded in popularity this year, asked a court last month to issue a preliminary injunction to prevent an administrative complaint brought by the Massachusetts Securities Division from proceeding. In its request, Robinhood argued that the state’s new fiduciary rule—which state regulators have accused Robinhood of violating—should be invalidated.<br />In his ruling, Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Kenneth W. Salinger didn’t rule on the validity of the state’s fiduciary rule, which requires brokers to act in their clients’ best interest. Instead, he indicated Robinhood could continue to challenge the rule in court.<br />Robinhood has argued that the fiduciary rule doesn’t apply to the company, in part, because it is a self-directed brokerage that doesn’t make investment recommendations or provide advice. The brokerage has also argued that the rule is in conflict with other regulations and determinations, and that the state’s top securities regulator, Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, is unable to “redefine the common law of broker-dealers.” The fiduciary rule was supported by Mr. Galvin and took effect last year.<br />In the decision, Judge Salinger requested further information from both parties about whether Robinhood’s challenge to the fiduciary rule should move forward, or whether it should be paused pending the outcome of state regulators’ administrative complaint.</td>

      <td>KAMPALA Uganda—French President Emmanuel Macron publicly acknowledged his country’s “terrible responsibility” in Rwanda’s 1994 genocide and asked for forgiveness in a bid to reset relations during the first visit by a French leader to the East African nation in more than a decade.<br />In a sober statement at the Gisozi genocide memorial in the capital, Kigali, where nearly a third of the 800,000 victims are buried, Mr. Macron said that France made errors of judgment in standing by a genocidal regime during the 100 days of massacres.<br />“France has political responsibility in Rwanda, it has a duty to recognize the share of the suffering it inflicted on the Rwandan people,” Mr. Macron said, shortly after laying a wreath at the memorial. “I have come to recognize our responsibilities; only those who survived can perhaps forgive.”<br />While Mr. Macron’s remarks fell short of a full apology, his focus on victims and survivors underscored France’s continuing efforts to thaw three decades of frozen relations with Kigali. Mr. Macron’s televised remarks were also received favorably across most of Rwanda, where media is tightly controlled.<br />“It’s a historic turning point,” said Kanimba Joseph, a 37-year-old genocide survivor from Kigali, who lost both parents in the killings. “By accepting responsibility France is healing a lot of wounds.”</td>

      <td>Seven notable noses—a chef, florist, perfumer and others—recall the aromas of favorite vacation spots they can’t wait to inhale again</td>
      <td>RARELY do we go rummaging through our brain’s olfactory files for reminders of an impressive vacation. But this is a great time to give a workout to what chef Marcus Samuelsson calls our “smell muscle,” using our sense of smell to experience more of the world. You’re sure to get your heart pumping.<br />Emerging from the cocoon we were unceremoniously stuffed into a year ago, many of us are starting to dream of returning to a favorite place—a beloved getaway spot that has been frustratingly off-limits for the past 14 months. While photos or particularly vivid TV shows might conjure the image of those out-of-reach destinations, they can’t reproduce the feeling of being there. “When we smell things we are directly experiencing little bits of that place, the materials that make up that place,” said author Harold McGee, whose most recent book, “Nose Dive: A Field Guide To The World’s Smells,” came out in the fall. The aroma of the place is perhaps the only experience we can’t transport as a souvenir.<br />Not that it hasn’t been tried. Versions of Smell-O-Vision or Scentovision, a system that transmits smells during films or television shows, first wafted onto the scene in the 1960s after Swiss scientist Hans Laube introduced it in 1939 at the World’s Fair. “It didn’t work,” said Mr. McGee, but hold tight for another decade or so and we’ll be able to visit India and share the smell experience when we return home, he predicted. Until then, we asked Mr. McGee as well as six other professionals for whom scent plays an important role to share the aromas that evoke their strongest memories of places they’re eager to sniff once again.<br />“I live in San Francisco and we’ll often go on a driving trip up the coast to Mendocino. I smell the ocean and the redwoods. The redwood forests have a particular smell—moist, evergreen, woody,” said Mr. McGee, adding that the bark on the massive trees tends to be flaky, which may contribute to the aroma. Other indelible scent memories are less agreeable. “I love visiting New York, Paris and London. I think of the smell of the subways,” said Mr. McGee. “In Paris, the subways have rubber wheels, and that may be what gives it its distinct smell. The London subways are deep underground. You feel the stifle of air. In New York, walking along the streets you pass the subway grates, you smell the subway more than the street. Not always pleasant.”<br />Ms. Burch’s most memorable vacation smell comes from the Caribbean. “A flower called Lady of the Night blooms in the evening at our home in Antigua,” said Ms. Burch. “The scent is magnificent—a floral with tremendous depth. It travels from room to room and throughout the gardens with the wind.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Prospects dimmed for an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, after most Senate Republicans lined up against the proposal at the urging of GOP leaders.<br />The bill will need 60 votes to advance in the evenly divided Senate, thanks to the chamber’s longstanding filibuster rule. That means 10 Republicans would have to vote with all 50 Democrats to allow the bill to proceed. A vote could come later Thursday.<br />Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) declared his opposition to the commission, calling it a political exercise. He suggested that Democrats would weaponize the commission against Republican candidates to keep the controversy over former President Donald Trump’s actions before and during the riot at the forefront of next year’s midterm election campaigns.<br />“The heart of this recommendation by the Democrats is that they would like to continue to debate things that occurred in the past,” Mr. McConnell told reporters earlier this week. “They’d like to continue to litigate the former president into the future.”<br />Democrats could impanel their own special congressional committee to investigate the events surrounding Jan. 6, but party leaders, including President Biden, have said they prefer an independent, bipartisan probe, modeled on the investigation carried out by the 9/11 Commission following the 2001 terrorist strikes.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden is expected to propose a $6 trillion budget on Friday that would lay the foundation for his plans to modernize the nation’s infrastructure and expand the government’s role in providing healthcare, education and other social services, according to people familiar with the plans.<br />The Biden administration’s first budget, for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, would put the nation on a path to spend $8.2 trillion annually by the end of 2031, the people said. Under the plan, debt would exceed the record level seen at the end of World War II within a few years and reach 117% of economic output by the end of 2031, up from about 100% this year.<br />Federal spending next year would rise about $300 billion, or 5%, from 2021, according to February projections from the Congressional Budget Office, before Congress enacted Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package.<br />The budget request, which typically reflects an administration’s policy priorities, is expected to detail the proposals Mr. Biden has already laid out in his infrastructure and family-aid plans over the past few months. Officials have said those plans, which envision sharply higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, will generate enough revenue to offset higher spending within 15 years, but will add to deficits in the meantime.<br />“The president’s proposal, you’ll see, will have a temporary period of spending and permanent tax increases that, beyond the budget window, will result in lower deficits and more tax revenue to support those expenditures,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told lawmakers Thursday. “I believe it is a fiscally responsible program.”</td>

His billing activities had already left a former business partner uneasy, the partner later told the FBI, but once the pandemic hit the activities appeared to go into overdrive.<br />Mr. Taylor acquired a California lab for $60,000 in February 2020, according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit filed last week, and used it to bill more than $42 million in fake claims through last month. Mr. Taylor bundled expensive and unnecessary tests with those coded as Covid-19-related, in an apparent effort to slip them through for approval, the affidavit alleged. The document said $11 million of those claimed were paid.<br />The California lab, Beach Tox, didn’t conduct any tests after Mr. Taylor acquired it, and didn’t have any equipment in the lab to do so after July 2020, the affidavit said, citing the lab equipment’s owner. A lawyer for Mr. Taylor, who was arrested and released Wednesday on bond, said Mr. Taylor would plead not guilty. “There are a significant number of factual inaccuracies in the complaint affidavit that will be addressed as this case proceeds,” the lawyer, Robert Nicholson, said.<br />Mr. Taylor is one of around a dozen people charged by federal prosecutors in the past week with participating in fraud schemes related to the pandemic, as the Justice Department ramps up investigations into misconduct tied to Covid-19 and the trillions of dollars in government relief funds provided since last year. The new cases collectively account for around $143 million in fraudulent bills to government healthcare programs, the agency said.<br />“These medical professionals, corporate executives and others allegedly took advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to line their own pockets instead of providing needed healthcare services during this unprecedented time in our country,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.</td>

Plus three great enterprises were wrongly vilified. You state “CEOs get paid to lead and protect their brands, not to be led by people who think business should embrace their politics.

The integrity of the political ground rules of a free society are critical to the free-enterprise system’s functioning. One-time Trump supporter Steve Schwarzman has long advised: “We believe in investing where there is the rule of law and not the law of rulers.” Former Trump supporter Nelson Peltz confessed on Jan. 7, “I voted for him this past election in November. Today, I’m sorry I did that.” Major Trump supporter and Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone said the denial of President Biden’s win was “a disgrace” and encouraged people to rally around Mr. Biden as president, saying the tantrums of a loser were “not what I signed up for.” Yet Daniel Henninger’s “When CEOs Zoom for Democrats” (Wonder Land, April 15) mocked a forum of 90 major CEOs I led to discuss patriotic efforts at restoring social harmony—derisively calling them “CEO Zoomers.” Few of us were Davos attendees—unlike President Trump.

Gretchen Whitmer is right, Line 5 is “a ticking time bomb.”<br />This 68-year-old pipeline was designed to operate for only 50 years. It has already reported 33 polluting spills, some close to the Great Lakes. Its protective coating is incomplete and its supports are sinking. It is particularly vulnerable in the busy shipping channel in the Straits of Mackinac, where it was recently dented by an anchor.<br />An oil spill in the Straits would be disastrous. Did we learn nothing when Enbridge devastated the Kalamazoo River with a gigantic spill from a 41-year-old pipeline?<br />There is no evidence that shutting down Line 5 would cause U.S. gasoline shortages, like the Colonial Pipeline disruption did. That’s because the Colonial Pipeline, which supplies 100 million gallons a day of gasoline to gas stations that serve U.S. consumers, was shut down without notice. Consumers were unaffected last summer when a court shut Line 5 down for 18 days. Line 5 carries no gasoline. It transports 7 million gallons a day of hydrocarbons to U.S. refineries, which have had six months to make other plans.<br />The authors assume that this outdated pipeline won’t cause an environmental disaster. This is taking a huge bet with no safety net. In ordering Line 5 to shut down, Gov. Whitmer is protecting us all.</td>

In the letter, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. O’Leary described the incident as a “premeditated and unlawful” hijacking and “an illegal and reprehensible action.”<br />On Sunday, Belarus scrambled a jet fighter to intercept a Ryanair commercial jet flying over the country en route from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania. Belarus says it diverted the plane because of a suspected bomb aboard. While on the ground in Minsk, authorities arrested a prominent dissident living in exile who was a passenger, along with his girlfriend.<br />The European Union and the U.S. have called the incident a brazen case of interference with civilian aviation. The EU has urged its carriers not to fly over Belarus. Belarus said it acted responsibly and in accordance with international protocols for dealing with a bomb threat.<br />On Thursday, foreign ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations and the EU’s foreign policy chief called the diversion “a serious attack on the rules governing civil aviation” and called on the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization to investigate the incident.</td>

      <td>These new swim fitness gadgets—paired with cutting-edge apps—will leave you better equipped to (finally) take on pools again</td>
      <td>AS SWIMMERS return to their local pools this summer after a very long dry spell, they’ll have their pick of new tracking and timing technology to improve their strokes. From heart-rate sensors that clip onto goggle bands to smart goggles that project a tally of how many laps you’ve swum directly onto the lens, underwater fitness tech is catching up to its aboveground cousins. Much like Fitbits, these new devices relay via companion apps how hard you worked and whether to take it easy or push yourself on your next swim. We tested some of the most intriguing innovations to see what’s helpful and what’s hype before you invest.<br />Tired of having only your thoughts for company in the lanes? Zygo has overcome Bluetooth’s traditional ineffectiveness at communicating through water with its proprietary transmitter that can send sound from your phone, through the water and into the waterproof headset. Just set the walkie talkie-size transmitter at the end of the pool (not ideal for crowded public areas) and pair your headphones to the Zygo app, where you can choose from one of the over 150 available coached training sessions; or any podcast or playlist on your phone. ($299, shopzygo.com)<br />With these smart goggles, instead of squinting at the clock every 100 meters to see how fast you’re freestyling, you can look off into your peripheral vision to check your lap tally, set time, rest time and more. We found it easy to take in the display, which lives at the corner of the lens, at a glance. Once you pull yourself out of the pool, log into the companion app on your phone to view other statistics related to your workout, from stroke type to kilocalories burned. The app will also let you share your metrics with friends. ($235, finisswim.com)<br />Like the Finis’s, Form’s goggles will tally your laps and tell you how long it took to complete each one. But here, the goggles use an OLED display to project your metrics in front of you as you swim, giving them the appearance of floating in the water. You can customize the display to choose which stats you see, including stroke rate, pace, distance and calories. And, like the Finis, you can view even more fitness data once you log into the app post-swim. ($199, formswim.com)<br />If you want to focus on swimming not data-mining, just clip this nifty little heart-rate, distance and stroke tracker to any goggle strap. Designed by Olympic swimmers and coaches for all levels of swimmers, the tracker will very accurately relay via the Phlex app how hard you exerted yourself. When you check your phone post-workout, you’ll also get a “Splash Score” based on your heart rate and effort to help you improve. ($250, phlexswim.com)</td>

It also plans to restart several auto factories in Canada, Mexico and South Korea within the next several weeks that make models such as the Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain crossover vehicles.<br />Despite the reopening of these facilities, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has said the company expects the second quarter to be the auto maker’s weakest of 2021 in terms of reduced production before some recovery occurs in the back half of the year.<br />The computer-chip shortage continues to cloud an otherwise robust new-vehicle market, more than a year after the Covid-19 health crisis led to a collapse in U.S. auto sales and production last spring.<br />The lack of semiconductors, used in engines, braking systems and other vehicle components, has led to factory disruptions across the auto industry and left dealers with nearly bare new-car lots. It is also prompting companies to reduce their manufacturing and earnings forecasts for the year.</td>

      <td>Dick’s, Best Buy among chains facing challenges finding products as shoppers flood in; ‘We’re chasing all the time’</td>
      <td>Big retail chains such as  Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc.  and  Best Buy Co.  say they are rushing to have enough goods to sell in their stores this year amid surging demand from American consumers for products from fitness equipment to televisions.<br />The situation is a sharp turn from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic a year ago, when many retail executives worried aloud about whether shoppers would ever return to their stores. Companies shifted to e-commerce and added curbside services. But this spring, as vaccines roll out, households get stimulus funds and restrictions are lifted, people are shopping in stores again.<br />The spending is adding to inventory challenges that surfaced last year when shoppers hurried to buy items such as toilet paper and bikes. Now, purchasing teams are dealing with a range of in-demand items along with pandemic-fueled strain on supply chains. They risk potentially losing out on sales as consumers have historic levels of money to spend.<br />“It’s hit almost every aspect of the business, so we’re chasing all the time. We’re chasing everything. But we’ve gotten really good at it,” Lauren Hobart, chief executive of Dick’s Sporting Goods, said this week about finding some products. Executives have pointed to supply constraints for certain products, and in March said the company had been pushing to get fitness items, kayaks, golf equipment and athletic apparel.<br />Dick’s reported sales in the quarter ended May 1 more than doubled from a year ago when stores temporarily closed, and jumped 52% from the same period in 2019. Ms. Hobart said team sports returned with a vengeance while golf, fitness and outdoor products also had strong demand.</td>

      <td>Uncertainty stems from use of chip maker’s graphics processors by ‘miners’</td>
      <td>“Not like last time” can be a dangerous phrase in business. But in the case of  Nvidia  and its relationship with crypto-miners, it also happens to be true.<br />Worries about the impact of crypto-mining have hung over the chip maker as the latest cryptocurrency craze began pushing ethereum prices skyward earlier this year. Nvidia’s graphics processors designed for videogaming are also used to “mine” ethereum, which involves matching and updating cryptocurrency transactions in return for rewards. Those rewards grow as ethereum prices rise, and this year has seen the cryptocurrency’s value soar nearly fourfold, even after a sharp correction over the past few weeks.<br />Nvidia got badly burned by a previous ethereum price jump and subsequent crash in 2018, which resulted in miners dumping their chips on the secondary market and thus hurting Nvidia’s sales. So investors are extra wary this time around, as evidenced by the reaction to the company’s fiscal first-quarter results late Wednesday. Revenue surged 84% year over year to about $5.7 billion, while the company projected $6.3 billion for the current period—14% above Wall Street’s expectations. But the company acknowledged that crypto demand will drive some of that upside. Nvidia’s share price slipped 1% Thursday morning.<br />Nvidia’s business with crypto-miners is hard to fully quantify. The company has started selling specialized graphics cards designed for mining, and it estimates that revenue from these products totaled $150 million in the recently ended quarter and will reach $400 million in the current period. That’s about 6% of Nvidia’s total projected revenue for the quarter. But the company also admits miners could still be snapping up its regular gaming cards as well, even though Nvidia has employed some technical measures to make those products less useful for mining.<br />Strength in Nvidia’s main businesses should better contain any risk from crypto exposure this time around. Its gaming chip revenue has grown 66% since the fiscal year ended January of 2020, which bore the brunt of the impact of the last ethereum spike, while its data center unit has more than doubled. The two are on track to do a little over $20 billion in combined revenue for the current fiscal year—up 43% from the previous year.</td>

      <td>Early movers in decarbonization shift offer a glimpse of the hard times ahead for Exxon and Chevron</td>
      <td>Despite the drama of a watershed week for big oil, change will likely be slow and painful.<br />On Wednesday, an activist shareholder won its bid to install climate-friendly directors on  Exxon  Mobil’s board. Earlier in the day,  Royal Dutch Shell  was ordered by a Dutch court to reduce its total carbon emissions. Last week, the International Energy Agency, a longtime industry advocate, said investments in new fossil-fuel projects must cease to reach a target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.<br />Pressure on the petroleum industry to decarbonize is building on multiple fronts. U.S. oil giants that look at their more forward-thinking peers across the Atlantic for inspiration will find some lessons, but not easy ones.<br />The major European oil companies have refocused their attention on extending existing high-return sites rather than exploring new ones. Oil and gas expenditures were slashed during the coronavirus pandemic and remain down. Billions of dollars will still be spent on the traditional business, but likely with a higher hurdle rate because of more uncertain future demand, higher capital costs and rising carbon prices.<br />Green investment will increase, but that doesn’t mean  Chevron  and Exxon should start building solar or wind farms. Renewable projects could be tough without relevant experience. Competition is fierce for new sites and it is a low-margin business—more installation than exploration. There is a risk of overpaying.  BP ,  the last of the European supermajors to pivot toward green energy, paid a healthy premium to buy into offshore wind projects.</td>

      <td>Washington needs better coordination with the private sector to prevent and respond to hacking.</td>
      <td>Cybersecurity has for years been a wonky, abstract concern to most Americans. No longer. The long gasoline lines and price spikes resulting from the Colonial Pipeline attack were a wake-up call, the moment cyber got real for millions. The ransomware attack disrupted one of the largest refined-gasoline pipelines in the U.S. for six days, and is part of a disturbing trend. Our adversaries no doubt are noting the economic and societal cost inflicted; the number of people directly or indirectly affected by a malicious cyberattack is only going to rise.<br />That is one of the many reasons we have worked for the past two years as co-chairmen of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, a panel created by Congress and dedicated to writing a 21st-century “cyber doctrine” that better secures America from these threats. Our goal is to be the “9/11 commission” for cybersecurity before a catastrophic attack happens. Unlike many efforts out of Washington, our work has been productive. We are already crafting and passing legislation to ensure the U.S. government has the resources and tools to protect Americans.<br />This starts with the federal government improving its interactions with private industry—the companies and enterprises that comprise the overwhelming majority of our exposure to cyber threats. One priority is the identification, protection and defense of systemically important critical infrastructure. These are systems and assets like the electric grid, energy pipelines and the financial industry that, if targeted and exploited by adversaries or criminals, could lead to catastrophic consequences to national security, the U.S. economy and public health and safety.<br />A second commission priority is improving the shared situational awareness of cyber intrusions. The private economy owns and operates most of the country’s critical infrastructure, so collaboration is essential to preparation. To that end, the commission recommended the establishment of a Joint Collaborative Environment, a common, cloud-based environment that would allow for the increased sharing of cyber threat data between federal agencies and state and local governments and private industry. This “nerve center” approach would lead to greater detection and analysis of cyber threats that affect critical networks, whether public or private.<br />Third, the government needs to increase its capacity to respond to cyberattacks. As Vince Lombardi once said: It’s not whether you get knocked down. It’s whether you get back up. We want to make sure that critical infrastructure is resilient enough to weather a cyberattack and also get back up to 100% capacity swiftly. The commission recommended the codification of a “cyber state of distress,” a federal declaration that would trigger additional resources through a “cyber response fund,” not unlike what the U.S. now does in the case of natural disasters.</td>

HSBC  agreed to sell parts of its business to two U.S. regional banks,  Citizens Financial Group Inc.’s  Citizens Bank and  Cathay General Bancorp ’s  Cathay Bank.<br />HSBC will retain around two dozen locations and convert the sites into international wealth centers, it said. That would help the bank focus on the “banking and wealth-management needs of globally connected affluent and high-net-worth clients,” it added. It will go from about 1.4 million customers to roughly 300,000.<br />As such, the bank will no longer service customers with balances below $75,000.

He said the bank’s U.S. mass retail operations “are good businesses, but we lacked the scale to compete.”</td>

All of us—citizens and government officials—need to do our best to stamp it out.<br />“The recent attacks on the Jewish community are despicable, and they must stop,” President Biden tweeted Monday. “I condemn this hateful behavior at home and abroad—it’s up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor.” All Republicans and Democrats should applaud Mr. Biden’s firm stance.<br />Hours later, the president signed the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act into law, in response to racist attacks against Asian-Americans carried out by bigots who blame them for the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The latest eruption of anti-Semitism has been sparked by fighting between Israel and Hamas, the terrorist group that controls the Gaza Strip. But the perpetrators of these vile anti-Semitic attacks, in the U.S. and elsewhere, use the actions of Israel as an excuse to mount assaults against Jews.<br />There is nothing anti-Semitic about policy disagreements with the government of Israel. Jews themselves, including Israelis, are sharply divided in their opinions of the government, just as Americans are sharply divided in our views of the U.S. government. But attacking people because they’re Jewish isn’t about a policy dispute—it is about simple hatred.</td>

Massive outbreaks have been observed especially in mink farms, with Denmark culling millions of the mammals last year amid fears of new mutations.<br />A World Health Organization-led team investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic said in a March report that the virus very likely spread from bats and then to humans via another small mammal species such as mink, raccoon dogs or ferret badgers, either on a farm or in the wild. This week, President Biden ordered a U.S. intelligence inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, following renewed scrutiny of the possibility that the outbreak of the virus might have started with a laboratory leak in China.<br />Russia’s agriculture safety watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor said it has distributed 17,000 doses of the vaccine to both state and private clinics in several regions, including Moscow. Pet owners, breeders and owners of animals that are kept free range have expressed rising interest in the shot, and at least 10 cats and dogs have been vaccinated so far, the agency said.</td>

The first confirmed cases of Covid-19 emerged in Wuhan in December 2019.<br />But in a broadcast on Thursday, one of the team members suggested that any audit of Chinese laboratories should be done separately from the second phase of their research. Another expressed doubt that such an audit would reveal anything new.<br />“I think it’s the challenge that proving a negative is just impossible,” Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist on the team, said during the This Week in Virology podcast. “We run the risk indeed of losing the momentum for the real work that needs to be done.” Dr. Koopmans didn’t respond to a request for comment.<br />On Wednesday, President Biden ordered a fresh U.S. intelligence inquiry into the origins of the pandemic, asking for a report in 90 days that he said should include specific questions for China. U.S. intelligence has focused on two scenarios—whether the pandemic started as a result of human contact with infected animals, or a laboratory accident—and the majority view is that there is insufficient evidence currently to prove either one, Mr. Biden said. It was unclear if the podcast was recorded before the president’s order.</td>

The company also wants to be ready to ramp up to 70 by the first quarter of 2024, and is even considering a rate of 75 by 2025.<br />Likewise, a recent report by Reuters suggested that, in the U.S., Boeing is aiming to lift output of its 737 MAX to 42 jets a month in the fall of 2022.<br />Investors shouldn’t let their enthusiasm run wild. While consumers are hungry for chip-filled cars and electronics, airlines probably don’t want many planes in the near term, beyond opportunistic purchases at discounted prices. Indeed, 2021 output targets for the A320, which is the most popular aircraft family in the world, haven’t changed and remain set at 45 a month by the final quarter. This is lower than Airbus expected only seven months ago.<br />Moreover, larger jets still face an uncertain future due to the potentially lasting damage to business travel caused by the pandemic. Planned production for the A350 has only been lifted to six a month by the fall of 2022 from its current rate of five a month. The less popular A330neo remains stuck at two.</td>

Republicans panned the White House’s $1.7 trillion offer last week, itself a decrease from the Biden administration’s original $2.3 trillion plan, arguing that the White House hadn’t narrowed its proposal enough.<br />While Republicans’ latest offer partially closes the gap between the two sides, the negotiators will still face major differences in the talks, including how to categorize certain forms of spending.<br />How to pay for the infrastructure package also remains a source of sharp disagreement between the parties. Republicans have rejected the White House plan to raise taxes on companies, while the White House has argued against the fee increases favored by some Republicans.</td>

      <td>Boeing Co.  has agreed to pay $17 million in civil penalties for production lapses related to 737 aircraft models in a settlement with the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency said.<br />The settlement, which involves production problems that took place from 2015 to 2019 with the narrow-body passenger jet, comes as the agency has increased its scrutiny of Boeing’s production and quality controls of other aircraft such as the wide-body Dreamliner, often used on international routes.<br />As part of the settlement, announced Thursday, Boeing agreed to undertake steps to bolster its internal quality checks. They include assessing whether the manufacturer and its suppliers are ready to safely increase 737 production. It also agreed to allow the FAA to review those assessments—a requirement an FAA official said was rare but not unprecedented when the agency confronts manufacturing problems.<br />Boeing could face up to another $10 million in deferred penalties if it doesn’t follow through on the settlement terms. The penalty amounts are capped by federal law. Earlier this year, the FAA said Boeing would pay $6.6 million for failing to meet its obligations under a 2015 settlement and to resolve two enforcement cases. Boeing also reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department to resolve a criminal investigation into the 737 MAX’s development.<br />Problems covered by Boeing’s latest FAA settlement aren’t related to two 737 MAX crashes in late 2018 and early 2019, which claimed 346 lives.</td>

      <td>President Biden’s coming budget proposal will include his decision on whether to push to end a ban on using federal dollars for abortions in most cases, potentially opening a new front in the clash over access to the procedure.<br />Mr. Biden said during his presidential campaign that he backed scrapping the ban, known as the Hyde Amendment, reversing his longstanding position in favor of the measure that has been included in spending bills for decades.<br />Keeping the language out of his Friday budget proposal would be welcomed by many Democrats and abortion-rights advocates, but eliminating the Hyde Amendment would face headwinds in Congress, where most Republicans are opposed.<br />Mr. Biden’s budget proposal won’t likely be enacted in full by lawmakers, but it serves as a statement of the White House’s priorities. And his decision comes as some states add new restrictions on abortions and the Supreme Court prepares to consider the legality of a Mississippi abortion law that sought to ban the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy.<br />The White House declined to discuss the budget but said the president’s position on the Hyde Amendment hasn’t changed since his campaign statements.</td>

      <td>With the unveiling of one of three built-to-order Boat Tails, Rolls-Royce introduces a Coachbuild program that invites the customer into its design studio.</td>
      <td>At 60 Miles an hour the loudest noise in this new  Rolls-Royce  comes from the electric clock.” David Ogilvy wrote this tagline in 1958 to underscore the kind of exacting workmanship that went into Rolls-Royce’s Silver Cloud. The line has passed into advertising legend. Ogilvy’s phrasing wasn’t just catchy, it helped boost American sales.<br />Luxury marches on, sometimes in a direction few would even dream of going. The poor copywriter forced to adapt Ogilvy’s neat formulation to the new Rolls-Royce Boat Tail—the first to be unveiled from the company’s just-announced Coachbuild customization program—would have his hands full. Would-be owners who have been anointed by Rolls get to have a hand in building the car from scratch, from initial sketches through a full-scale clay model to delivery.<br />What does that mean for the “electric clock”? For this Boat Tail, one of three built on the same chassis, the clock is the owner’s heavy mechanical watch. He likes to take his watches off when he gets behind the wheel, but he hates stowing them in the glove compartment. So Rolls-Royce worked with the Swiss watchmaker Bovet 1822 to develop both a watch and a housing on the dashboard that would allow its complicated tourbillon movement, which can be sensitive to motion or temperature changes, to keep on ticking (without electronic assistance—the owner was adamant) while avoiding any interference from vibrations or the car’s antenna. “This has never been achieved,” says Alex Innes, Rolls-Royce’s head of Coachbuild design. “And having lived and breathed it for two and a half years, I know why.”<br />How do you squeeze that into an ad? The answer is, you don’t. For one thing, nobody else can ever buy this car. For another, the owner wouldn’t hear of it. Rolls is keeping his identity private so we know nothing about him, beyond the fact that the face of his Bovet watch duplicates the night sky over his birthplace on the day he was born. Where and when is a secret.<br />How much will one of those custom jobs set you back? Rolls-Royce declines to say, but an earlier customization project, the Sweptail from 2017, had a reported sticker price of $13 million. For that kind of money the owner can do just about anything he or she wants to the car, from tweaking the lines of its silhouette to gratifying whims that may strike some—OK, me—as slightly insane. How else to characterize a built-in fridge configured to cool the owner’s preferred champagne to his preferred temperature in exactly the time it takes him to arrive at the place where he likes to drink it? (None of this is for the half-hearted. The bespoke collaboration takes about four years and requires frequent consultations at Rolls-Royce’s headquarters in West Sussex, England.)</td>

      <td>Stablecoins are one of the weirdest things in the whole bizarro world of cryptocurrencies, because they operate on principles directly opposed to the rest of the crypto system.<br />Crypto true believers argue that bitcoin and its ilk will supplant “fiat” currencies issued by governments, while the whole point of the innovative blockchain that underlies them is to overcome what pseudonymous inventor Satoshi Nakamoto called “the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.”<br />Yet stablecoins, and especially the largest, Tether, are thriving. Tether’s $60 billion of issuance leaves it jockeying for third place in crypto market value behind bitcoin and ethereum. There are scores of others, and  Facebook ’s  Libra, renamed Diem last year, plans to join in with stablecoins covering several currencies.<br />Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency tied one-for-one to dollars or other traditional currencies and whose value relies on trusting the issuer.<br />Stablecoins have also become central to the financial infrastructure of crypto. According to data provider Crypto Compare there’s more trading between Tether and bitcoin than between bitcoin and all fiat currencies put together. For crypto traders, at least, stablecoins are a vital tool, because of the speed with which they can be used to move money from one crypto exchange to another, and because they provide a handy way to park cash temporarily in what is basically dollars.</td>

      <td>The White House is set to release its multitrillion-dollar fiscal year 2022 budget Friday. Here is a guide to what the blueprint means—and how it could take on outsize importance this year.<br />The president’s budget proposal serves as a fiscal blueprint for the administration’s policy priorities and signals to Congress what the White House hopes to accomplish over the coming years. It also provides a detailed look at how the president’s spending and revenue proposals would affect federal deficits and debt. It includes the administration’s assumptions about how those policies would affect economic growth, inflation and interest rates.<br />The White House is expected to release President Biden’s first budget proposal Friday morning.<br />Some years, lawmakers skip trying to pass a budget entirely and just move straight to the spending bills needed to fund the government. But this year, Democrats might try to pass legislation under a process tied to the budget known as reconciliation. If Democrats in the House and Senate can pass an identical budget, then they can pass legislation with a meaningful connection to the budget with a simple majority in the Senate, rather than the 60 votes most bills need. That means they can pass legislation without GOP support in the Senate—as they did with the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package passed in March, which was tied to the fiscal year 2021 budget.<br />Mr. Biden hopes to get GOP support for an infrastructure bill, but if the two sides can’t reach a deal, Democrats might try to pass a sweeping infrastructure, child-care and education package using this process. But none of it is possible if they can’t agree first on a budget.</td>

      <td>Airbus  SE laid out a long-term plan to return aircraft production to pre-pandemic levels, putting its suppliers and customers on notice that it is betting air travel, and jet demand, will bounce back quicker than others expect.<br />Airbus said it plans to lift production of its bestselling A320 narrow-body to 64 a month by the second quarter of 2023—topping its 2019 average monthly output of 60. It set out a longer-term ambition of reaching 70 a month at the beginning of 2024. That could rise to 75 in 2025, the company said.<br />At the start of the crisis, Airbus cut rates across its programs by roughly 40% and reduced its A320 output to 40 a month.<br />The new rate plan for the A320neo is “markedly higher” than previous expectations, according to Sandy Morris, an aerospace analyst at Jefferies in London. Jefferies had forecast an average production rate of around 52 a month in 2023, and 57 a month in 2024. Airbus shares were up almost 6% in midday European trading.<br />Industry executives have repeatedly said they expect travel demand to stay below pre-Covid levels for years. While Airbus has penciled in two full years before its factories are back where they were before the crisis, it is essentially telling its globe-spanning supply chain that the plane maker is sticking to what has been for months a more optimistic forecast for air travel recovery than many in the industry.</td>

But investors betting on a further jump in the yuan might be disappointed.<br />Chinese market benchmark CSI 300 rose 3.2% Tuesday, the biggest one day move in almost a year. That has put the index into positive territory for the year, but it’s still lagging behind most other major markets. The S&P 500 is up 11.7% in 2021.

That was the highest three-day inflow since the trading link’s launch in 2014.<br />The yuan has also appreciated below 6.4 per dollar this week, its strongest level since 2018. That is mostly down to dollar weakness, though the yuan has also done better than most other major currencies this year. Recent comments from some researchers at China’s central bank may have triggered hopes that Beijing could allow the yuan to strengthen further. One said that China should stop controlling the exchange rate, while another suggested appreciating the yuan to offset rising prices in imported commodities.</td>

That level would represent the lowest levels of claims since the coronavirus pandemic’s onset last year and the fourth consecutive week claims have reached a fresh pandemic low.<br />Separately, economists forecast that other reports will show that orders for durable goods—items designed to last at least three years—rose 0.9% in April, and that U.S. gross domestic product in the first quarter grew at a 6.6% seasonally adjusted annual rate, higher than the initial 6.4% estimate.<br />Taken together, the data will likely point to an economy that is gaining strength as Covid-19 cases steadily decrease, more Americans receive vaccines against the virus and governments ease restrictions on businesses.<br />“I think there’s still a lot of pain out there, but the good news is that it really looks like the economy is kicking into overdrive, and I do see positive signs for the job market,” said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global Ratings.</td>

      <td>Facebook Inc.  has ended its ban on posts asserting Covid-19 was man-made or manufactured, a policy shift that reflects a deepening debate over the origins of the pandemic that was first identified in Wuhan, China, almost 18 months ago.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that three researchers from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care, according to a previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report.<br />“In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of COVID-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps,” Facebook said in a statement on its website Wednesday.<br />President Biden on Wednesday ordered a U.S. intelligence inquiry into the origins of the virus. The White House has come under pressure to conduct its own investigation after China told the World Health Organization that it considered Beijing’s part of the investigation complete, calling for efforts to trace the virus’s origins to shift into other countries.<br />Earlier this month a group of 18 prominent scientists called for a deeper investigation into the circumstances in which the virus emerged, including the possibility that a laboratory accident released it.</td>

I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn.

      <td>ALBANY, N.Y.—Worker groups are split over a proposal in New York state that would let ride-hail drivers and delivery workers form unions and get access to additional benefits while sidestepping the question of whether they should be classified as employees.<br />State Sen. Diane Savino, a Democrat from Staten Island, began circulating a draft of the proposed legislation last week. She said she was having ongoing discussions with worker groups and app companies—including  DoorDash Inc.,   Lyft Inc.  and  Uber Technologies Inc.<br />Ms. Savino hopes her bill will be enacted before the state Legislature adjourns for summer recess on June 10. But groups representing delivery workers as well as labor unions who voiced support for the measure backed away this week, reducing the odds of rapid action, lawmakers said.<br />Representatives for Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, both Democrats, didn’t respond to requests for comment about the proposal. A spokesman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said, “This is an issue that we’ve been looking at and we will review this and any other similar proposals.”<br />Ms. Savino estimated her bill would affect more than 200,000 people. Most app-based workers—including Uber and Lyft drivers—are currently considered independent contractors, and as such aren’t covered by New York’s wage and hour laws or by state systems of workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance.</td>

Hours later in the U.S., an activist investor won at least two seats on Exxon’s board, a historic defeat for the oil giant that will likely require it to alter its fossil-fuel focused strategy.<br />The back-to-back, watershed decisions demonstrated how dramatically the landscape is shifting for oil-and-gas companies as they face increasing pressure from environmentalists, investors, lenders, politicians and regulators to transition to cleaner forms of energy.<br />“The events of today show definitively that many leaders in the oil-and-gas industry have a tin ear and do not understand that society’s views and the legal and political environment in which they operate are changing radically,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School who has advised energy companies.<br />Many oil companies have begun adopting comprehensive plans to reduce emissions, and some, especially in Europe, have diversified into renewable energy. But reducing emissions while generating returns is proving challenging, and many face skepticism about their strategies.</td>

      <td>Graphics-chip maker says quarterly gaming revenue more than doubled from year-ago period</td>
      <td>Nvidia Corp.  reported a record quarterly revenue and profit, propelled by demand for videogaming and cryptocurrency and despite a broad-based shortage of semiconductors.<br />The chip maker on Wednesday posted net income for its most recent quarter of $1.91 billion, more than double the year-prior figure. Revenue rose 84% to $5.66 billion. Both profit and revenue exceeded expectations, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.<br />Nvidia is the latest chip company to have enjoyed months of booming demand for computing power that has padded order books. The hot market has triggered shortages of some chips, affecting companies as varied as  Apple Inc.  and  Ford Motor Co.  and contributing to President Biden’s recent call for $50 billion to strengthen the U.S. semiconductor industry.<br />Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia, which last year became the U.S.’s biggest chip company by value, specializes in graphics processors that have flown off shelves as people flocked to videogaming for entertainment during the coronavirus pandemic. The way those graphic chips work has also made them popular for other applications, including performing artificial-intelligence calculations and mining cryptocurrencies, further inflating demand.<br />Nvidia’s gaming division—its largest in terms of revenue—more than doubled sales in the quarter. Sales for its datacenter business advanced 79% from the year earlier to more than $2 billion. The main drivers behind the record revenue were graphics cards for laptops and personal computers, said financial chief Colette Kress. Cryptocurrency demand also aided results, she said, with some uncertainty as to the extent of its contribution.</td>

      <td>The ‘Friends’ reunion show on HBO Max is the culmination of a fervent nostalgia trip encompassing everything ’90s—particularly the body-conscious fashion worn by Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green</td>
      <td>Off Brand is a column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />POORVA SETH, 21, a recent graduate of the University of Toronto, wore a tight white T-shirt, beige jacket, miniskirt and knee-high boots to an outdoor lunch date this spring. Her sartorial inspiration? Rachel Green, the character that Jennifer Aniston played in the ultra-popular sitcom “Friends.” The show, which is being revisited in a reunion special on HBO Max this week, went off the air just a few years after Ms. Seth was born in 1999. Yet like many Gen-Z women, she considers Rachel Green “the style icon that I look to the most.”<br />Although it’s been nearly 30 years since “Friends” debuted in 1994, its avant-basic aesthetic is a source of inspiration for many people who were too young to absorb it the first time around. Although the show’s kooky coffee-shop set design has not endured in the same way, its body-conscious and colorful fashion is having a moment. Specifically the styles worn by Rachel Green, the show’s resident fashion plate, who had evolved from an unemployable suburban princess into a polished Ralph Lauren executive by the time series ended its run in 2004. Emily Perry, who runs the popular Instagram account @everyfriendsoutfit, noticed, “More than any other ‘Friend’ her outfits get the most questions about where and how to buy certain pieces and get shared widely.”<br />According to Google data from 2020 compiled by Money.co.uk, Rachel Green was the TV character with the most-searched style, easily beating the next in line, Maddy Perez from the far-more-current HBO show “Euphoria.” Image-sharing platform  Pinterest  reports that searches for “Rachel Green aesthetic” are eight times higher over the last month than during the same time period in 2017, and searches for “Rachel Green outfits” have increased by 58%.<br />Both those who lived through the 1990s, as well as those who devour that decade’s look on TikTok, know what the Rachel Green look entails: skinny layered T-shirts, knee-high boots, overalls, slip dresses, low-rise cargo pants, shorts with tights, plaid mini-skirts, buttoned cardigans. Although what I recall most powerfully about Rachel Green from the (actual) ’90s was her highlighted shag hairdo—the “Rachel”—it now takes a back seat to her fashion. Currently trending on TikTok: videos enumerating style lessons learned from Rachel Green (for example, “A Little Black Dress is always a good idea”).</td>

      <td>Confused by the different offerings from wireless carriers? We’ll clear things up.</td>
      <td>Engineers developed the software and circuitry to make 5G possible. Corporate marketers are the ones explaining to the public how it all works.<br />That’s where things get complicated.<br />As with the previous generation of wireless service, cellphone carriers have pinned a confusing array of brand names on 5G services. Each type reveals a tradeoff: Some 5G signals can be found across broad swaths of the U.S. but have yet to deliver dramatically better internet speeds than their 4G counterparts. Other 5G connections are extremely fast but hard to find outside stadiums and business districts. For anyone confused by 5G’s many flavors, here’s a quick guide:<br />5G<br />What it means: AT&T uses this simple label to describe most of its next-generation cellular coverage. It applies to service in the carrier’s low- and midrange frequencies. Signals carried over low-range frequencies provide the slowest connections in the 5G universe but travel the farthest. High-frequency signals transmit more data at a faster rate but don’t travel very far. Midrange frequencies are a balance of speed and distance. Testing by research firm Opensignal shows that AT&T’s 5G service is about twice as fast as its 4G service—far short of 5G’s ultimate capability.</td>

Mr. Chipman most recently served as a top policy adviser to the gun-control organization Giffords, led by former Democratic Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in 2011 along with 18 others in a Tucson-area supermarket parking lot. Six people died in the attack.<br />At a hearing Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, (R., Iowa), the committee’s minority leader, likened Mr. Chipman’s nomination to “putting a tobacco executive in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services.”</td>

      <td>How two resourceful Allies used spiritualism, deception and distinctively British nonsense to escape a Turkish prison camp in World War I.</td>
      <td>Tales of spunky prisoners of war suffering horrifying privation or outfoxing their sadistic or imbecilic captors are a staple of military history and the movies. John McCain devotes much of his Vietnam memoir “Faith of My Fathers” to his ordeal in the Hanoi Hilton, and “Stalag 17,” “The Bridge on the River Kwai,” “The Great Escape” and “Unbroken” are great films. Fact or fiction, few of them can match the latest entry in the genre for screwball comedy.<br />Margalit Fox’s “The Confidence Men” tells the tale of two Allied officers captured by the Turks during World War I who escaped their remote prison camp by pulling an ingenious and elaborate spiritualist con on the camp’s greedy commandant. A onetime writer of obituaries for the New York Times and the author of three other books, Ms. Fox brings a deadpan touch to her story.<br />Close your eyes and you can picture the young Sean Connery and Michael Caine of “The Man Who Would Be King” playing the two leads in a film based on the book. The impresario of the bizarre escape plan was Elias Henry Jones, 33, an Oxford-educated barrister and onetime magistrate in Burma during the British Raj. The son of a Welsh lord, Jones, a second lieutenant in the Indian Army Reserve, was captured after the disastrous siege of Kūt-al-‘Amāra, in what is now Iraq, in April 1916. His accomplice was Cedric Waters Hill, just 25, an Australian mechanic who became a pilot and just happened to be a skillful amateur sleight-of-hand artist.<br />After a hideous 62-day trek with other POWs covering nearly 2,000 miles, Jones was deposited in the Yozgat camp, a cluster of repurposed buildings in a small village in remote Anatolia, “the Alcatraz of its day.” Hill showed up not long after. The camp was commanded by Kiazim Bey, an aging autocrat who lived in fear of his prisoners escaping. His young aide-de-camp and translator was Moïse Eskenazi, a diminutive, officious Ottoman Jewish soldier, known to the prisoners as “the Pimple.” The British officers endured quarters crawling with vermin and choked down rotten food, but they were an enterprising lot. They formed an orchestra, gave lectures, held classes and staged entertainments. Jones fashioned a Ouija board from scrap, and using an inverted glass as a planchette, began giving mock readings for his fellow captives—the inspiration for his escape plot.<br />“The Confidence Men” is essentially a shaggy-dog thriller, so a tick-tock of their intricate scam with its twists and turns and near-disasters would cheat the reader. But it won’t spoil anything to report that their scheme involved a half-dozen spirits “summoned” by Jones surreptitiously manipulating the board, the chief of whom was “the Spook.” There was also a fiendishly complicated mind-reading act based on a memorized system of word clues relayed by the stooge to the sham mentalist. And a code using Welsh words to fool the Turkish censors while communicating with family back in Britain. Plus “trance-talking”—when the Ouija board was unavailable—not to mention the “Telechronistic Ray,” the “Four Cardinal Point Receiver,” a staged double hanging, and six months of feigned madness in a Turkish hospital.</td>

      <td>A bankruptcy judge said will let the OxyContin maker send its chapter 11 plan to creditors for a vote, a critical milestone that keeps the company on track for an August trial over its bankruptcy exit</td>
      <td>Purdue Pharma LP is preparing to poll creditors on its bankruptcy exit plan, a critical milestone as the OxyContin manufacturer prepares for a summer trial over a chapter 11 proposal that earmarks billions of dollars for opioid abatement programs.<br />Judge Robert Drain of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y., said Wednesday he intends to approve Purdue’s disclosure statement, a document describing the proposed repayment terms on which creditors will vote.<br />Judge Drain said he would formally approve the disclosure statement and accompanying solicitation materials that will be sent to creditors after lawyers incorporate final changes to the documents that were discussed at Wednesday’s hearing.<br />Purdue’s creditors are a vast and diverse group that includes states, municipalities, tribes, school districts and thousands of people who have asserted personal injury claims over OxyContin, the company’s flagship drug. Judge Drain said the disclosure statement provides Purdue creditors with sufficient information to give an informed vote on the chapter 11 plan.<br />The judge’s remarks follow weeks of negotiations between lawyers for Purdue and state authorities who demanded the drugmaker disclose more information about how the chapter 11 plan would work. Opponents have challenged a component of the chapter 11 plan that would release members of the Sackler family who own Purdue from thousands of opioid-related lawsuits in exchange for a $4.28 billion payment. The family has denied wrongdoing.</td>

      <td>The evidence catches up to Fauci and other Wuhan Covid deniers.</td>
      <td>President Biden on Wednesday ordered U.S. intelligence to dig deeper into the origins of Covid-19, a reversal after he reportedly ordered a State Department investigative unit shut down. Mr. Biden is trying to cover for his embarrassing closure of the investigation because the dam has finally broken on the evidence that the virus may have escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). The shame is that it took so long because the suspicious facts have been apparent from the start.<br />In January 2020, international media began reporting about a virus spreading in the Chinese city of Wuhan. “The coronavirus could result in a global pandemic,” said Sen. Tom Cotton on Jan. 30, 2020. “I would note that Wuhan has China’s only biosafety level-four super laboratory that works with the world’s most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus.”<br />The world would learn more about Covid-19—and the WIV. But it was always reasonable to ask if the virus came from a nearby lab that handled dangerous viruses. On Feb. 6, 2020, Botao Xiao of the South China University of Technology posted a paper concluding the virus “probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.” But the Chinese government strictly controls research into Covid-19’s origins, and the molecular biomechanics researcher withdrew his publication.<br />The Communist Party then went on offense, with Beijing’s ambassador to the U.S. declaring that lab-leak theories were “absolutely crazy” and could “fan up racial discrimination, xenophobia.” After Mr. Cotton responded by calling on China to “open up now to competent international scientists,” the media chose denial: “Tom Cotton keeps repeating a coronavirus conspiracy theory that was already debunked” (Washington Post) and “Senator Tom Cotton Repeats Fringe Theory of Coronavirus Origins” ( New York Times ).<br />The public-health clerisy also set boundaries for allowable discussion. On Feb. 19, 2020, the Lancet published a statement by scientists condemning “conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.” Although some academics quietly dissented, the document was promoted as proof that the lab possibility was “debunked.”</td>

      <td>Two board challengers win, but fossil fuels aren’t going away.</td>
      <td>The usual suspects are casting  Exxon  Mobil’s partial defeat in a proxy shareholder battle on Wednesday as a Waterloo for fossil fuels. Sorry—the vote is a reflection of the enormous political pressure and financial leverage of government pension funds, proxy advisers and asset managers like  BlackRock  that want to be seen as virtuous to the progressives who are now in power.<br />The San Francisco-based hedge fund Engine No. 1 formed in November of last year and set out to overhaul Exxon’s board. Its goal: Make the biggest U.S. oil and gas company “transition” out of its legacy business. The fund enlisted big public pension funds and exploited the pandemic’s ravages.<br />Exxon had to “wake up” and “get out of the oil and gas focus,” California State Teachers’ Retirement System (Calstrs) Chief Investment Officer Chris Ailman said in December. Critics said Exxon’s board was too deferential to management, which had invested in U.S. shale and cranked up debt as oil and gas prices plunged.<br />Critics also flogged former CEO Rex Tillerson’s big bet on Canada’s oil sands, which became unprofitable amid low prices. Exxon’s main misjudgment was to underestimate the impact of U.S. shale fracking on oil prices. It was late to shale and then paid a hefty sum for fracking pioneer XTO Energy in 2010.<br />While its European rivals have forged into renewables like wind and solar, Exxon has made a long-term bet that the world will need oil and gas for many more decades. It estimates that some $12 trillion to $17 trillion in new investment will be needed to generate enough oil and natural gas supplies to meet global demand through 2040.</td>

      <td>Covering the Afghan retreat but leaving the Asia-Pacific.</td>
      <td>The Journal reported Wednesday that the Pentagon plans to dispatch the USS Ronald Reagan, the only aircraft carrier operating in the Asia-Pacific theater, to the Middle East to cover the U.S. and NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan. This may seem like no big deal, but it highlights the U.S. Navy’s dearth of ships to meet its military missions.<br />The redeployment means the U.S. for several months will be without a carrier in the Western Pacific. The Reagan will sail to replace the aging USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which has to return home soon after two long deployments in 36 months. The U.S. has to cover the retreat from Afghanistan, but the deployment dilemma won’t end once U.S. troops leave.<br />President Biden has promised the U.S. can fulfill an antiterror mission in Afghanistan from over the horizon, but it isn’t clear how that will be done. Doing it with a carrier in the region would be a misuse of naval resources. It would have made more sense to remain in Afghanistan with a residual military force.<br />The missing carrier in East Asia should send a message that the U.S. is going to need more naval assets and a better strategy, or it’s going to have to shrink its commitments around the world. The problem is more urgent than Americans recognize.</td>
