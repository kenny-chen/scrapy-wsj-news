      <td>New York’s governor did to the disabled the same thing he did to the elderly.</td>
      <td>At last, Joe Biden, Anthony Fauci and CNN are no longer presenting New York Democrat Andrew Cuomo as the model governor in pandemic response. The question now is how many lives were lost due to his reckless policy of forcing vulnerable populations to accept greater risk of infection—and then hiding the results. Nursing homes were not the only places forced to accept Covid-positive patients.<br />Maria McFadden Maffucci writes at National Review: “Cuomo’s edicts put another vulnerable population in inexcusable peril: New Yorkers with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) living in group homes.” Ms. Maffucci writes:<br />Guess how that worked out for disabled New Yorkers. As is Cuomo custom, the state government withheld crucial information from public disclosure. Therefore scientists and policy makers had to try to make sense of limited data. Ms. Maffucci says that researchers often had to rely on voluntary reporting from advocacy organizations.<br />The available data told another highly disturbing story. Last year a study in Disability and Health Journal titled “COVID-19 outcomes among people with intellectual and developmental disabilities living in residential homes in New York state” reported some dismal statistics:<br />If the Cuomo government ever allows a full accounting, perhaps researchers can estimate the precise impact of the directive to facilities on accepting Covid-positive patients.</td>

      <td>An anti-inflammatory drug can help reduce the risk of death in people hospitalized with Covid-19, a new clinical trial indicates, reviving hopes—and debate—about a medicine that many physicians had abandoned after earlier clinical-trial failures.<br />A U.K. study of more than 4,000 hospitalized patients showed that people who received the rheumatoid arthritis drug tocilizumab plus steroids had a 20% lower risk of death after 28 days compared with patients who received steroids and standard care only, according to preliminary results posted online this month.<br />The results haven’t been published yet in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, but U.S. scientists are paying attention to them because of the reputation of the University of Oxford researchers who conducted the study. In June, the same Oxford researchers were the first to prove that the cheap and widely available steroid dexamethasone significantly reduced Covid-19 deaths, a finding that led to the drug becoming a standard treatment for most hospitalized patients.<br />Researchers say Oxford’s study may have succeeded where others failed because it included a much larger number of patients, whose average age was about 63, and included only patients with high inflammation measured in lab tests and low blood-oxygen. The data could lead to the drugs becoming more widely used, especially if they are included as suggested or recommended treatments in guidelines crafted by influential organizations such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health or the Infectious Diseases Society of America.<br />“There have been a lot of studies before this one that suggested a possible benefit and others that seemed not quite as compelling,” said Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. “I think what we were waiting for was a really large scale, well-designed study—and I think we may now have that.”</td>

      <td>The Food and Drug Administration said Monday it will quickly analyze any vaccine booster shots against Covid-19 variants such as those from South Africa and the U.K., and won’t require further large clinical trials of the new shots’ effectiveness.<br />The agency issued new guidance for vaccine manufacturers as it looks to establish speedier procedures to deal with virus mutations that could worsen the pandemic. Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement the agency is seeking “efficient ways to modify medical products that either are in the pipeline or have been authorized for emergency use to address emerging variants.”<br />The agency also announced new guidelines for makers of diagnostic tests and monoclonal-antibody drugs about how those companies can best adapt their products to address mutations now cropping up in the U.S.<br />Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s center for biological products, which evaluates vaccines, told reporters Monday the analysis of whether vaccines prevent the new strains of Covid-19 will involve a few hundred research subjects over a couple of months. That would be faster than vaccine trials, which so far have involved thousands of research subjects over several months, followed by an FDA analysis.<br />The federal agency has been criticized for taking up to three weeks just to analyze the clinical study of a new vaccine from  Johnson & Johnson .  J&J said its vaccine was 72% effective in the U.S. in preventing moderate to severe Covid-19 infection. This compared with 57% in South Africa, where the mutant strain has been prominently present.</td>

While vaccines also suppress new infections, the effect isn’t as pronounced.<br />The information appears to vindicate the U.K.’s policy of stretching limited vaccine supplies by delaying a second shot to up to 12 weeks after the first, while also emphasizing the extra protection that comes from a second shot.<br />The data include an analysis of the effect of vaccinations among the elderly, a study looking at infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare workers, and a broad look at vaccinations in Scotland that covered more than five million people.</td>

      <td>Regarding Alan S. Blinder’s “The Risks of Skimping on Covid Relief” (op-ed, Feb. 18): I might have agreed with Prof. Blinder if the problem today was one of inadequate aggregate demand, as it was in the 1930s and after 2008, but that is not the situation. His focus on traditional macroeconomic policy misses that today’s needs are to help the specific sectors impacted by the pandemic and the people suffering the greatest negative impact from it. It isn’t a problem of inadequate aggregate demand nor an issue of widespread, across-the-board unemployment. Look at the increase in savings rates and the all-time highs in the stock market to realize that sending checks based on prior years’ income with no attempt to target the aid to people who actually were hurt by the pandemic wasn’t the proper policy.<br />How can sending checks to a retired couple whose combined  income has remained steady at $150,000 a year in any way address the problems we currently are facing? A household with school-age children and adults who are now working at home and drawing the same (if not higher) salaries they did in 2019 would be much better served by programs aimed at getting schools reopened rather than receiving a stimulus check. There is no benefit to the travel-industry workers who have lost their jobs nor the restaurant workers whose places of employment close. These are the people who need help. Increasing aggregate demand won’t lead to more demand for air travel, rental cars and hotel stays as long as people are afraid to travel, nor will it increase restaurant employment as long as these places are precluded from being fully open due to health-department restrictions.<br />Bill Powar<br />Palo Alto, Calif.<br /></td>

      <td>The transportation sector currently represents more than 28% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.</td>
      <td>Holman Jenkins’s “EVs Are the Lowest Climate Priority” (Business World, Feb. 10) completely misses the mark. The transportation sector currently represents more than 28% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions per data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency—more than any other sector of the U.S. economy. Cars and light-duty trucks make up nearly 60% of those emissions, without any noticeable decrease in recent years. By way of contrast, carbon emissions from the U.S. power sector are at their lowest level in more than 30 years and continue to fall, as nearly 40% of our nation’s electricity comes from carbon-free sources.<br />Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time, and America’s investor-owned electric companies are well-positioned to continue to be part of the climate solution. This includes taking advantage of the great strides made from emissions reductions in the electric sector to help reduce transportation-sector emissions by increasing the number of nonemitting electric vehicles on U.S. roads. In other words, EVs are a top climate priority and an effective and proven lever to reduce emissions.<br />We look forward to leveraging our progress and to working with the Biden administration on policies that help drive electrification and reduce emissions from the transportation sector.<br />Tom Kuhn<br />President</td>

Additionally, there are critical pre-emptive measures, focusing global surveillance on origins of viral transmission, that will significantly reduce such needs in the first place: We know that over 62% of human emerging diseases derive from zoonoses, a disproportionate number in selected taxa (particularly bats, carnivores, rodents), and in those species that geographically reside mainly in Asia, tropical Africa and latitudinal/longitudinal hot spot regions. Together with information about which populations of these species are closer in proximity to humans, a comprehensive global network will complement organizational changes and provide early warning signals to curtail the chances of future pandemics.

The appointment must still be approved by the state-controlled company’s board at a meeting scheduled for Feb. 23.<br />Shares in Petrobras fell nearly 20% in late afternoon trading on Monday, and the Bovespa index fell more than 4%, with the Brazilian real sliding more than 1% against the dollar.<br />“It’s a complete disaster,” said Mailson da Nóbrega, a Brazilian economist and former finance minister.<br />He said Mr. Bolsonaro is increasingly ruling like a populist by intervening in Latin America’s largest company. “This creates insecurity about other areas of the government...it’s going to take a long time for us to come back from this,” he added.</td>

The justices appeared to be working on cleaning house of Trump-related litigation following the former president’s second Senate impeachment trial earlier this month.<br />A bipartisan Senate majority found Mr. Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection culminating in his supporters’ Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, but the 57-43 margin fell short of the two-thirds vote needed for conviction.<br />Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. has been investigating potential insurance and bank fraud by the Trump Organization and its officers. Mr. Vance sent a grand-jury subpoena to Trump accountant Mazars USA in August 2019, but the then-president intervened to block it, arguing that his official status immunized him from criminal investigation during his term.<br />Last July, the Supreme Court ruled that the president had no inherent power to prevent a third party from turning over records to criminal investigators but could assert other arguments any citizen could raise against a subpoena, such as that it was overbroad or issued for an improper purpose.</td>

After studying at a Chicago conservatory, Confrey whetted his keyboard skills by arranging player-piano rolls of pop music, embellishing notes and enriching harmonies. His roll work—about 170 pieces—remains an effervescent emblem of the 1920s. He went on to compose a variety of popular works, but he has been largely and unjustifiably forgotten.</td>

      <td>‘When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?”<br />There are competing accounts of the authorship of this affirmation of the importance of empiricism to the intellectual method. It used to be claimed for John Maynard Keynes. As with almost every quotable observation of the last 150 years it has been attributed to Winston Churchill. Most people now think it was more likely the work of Paul Samuelson.<br />Whoever said it first, it seems almost quaintly nostalgic in our age of individual epistemic autonomy, when facts are infinitely fungible and take second place to our ideological priors. An updated version of the adage might be: When the facts change, I deny them, ascribe them to some malevolent opponent, and then imagine another set of facts that allow me to leave my mind unchanged. What do you do, sir?<br />We’ve seen plenty of this epistemic nimbleness in the last year, with scientific claims that large gatherings threaten public health except when they’re in service of racial justice, or that political violence threatens public order only when it comes from the right.<br />As Samuelson could attest, economics is more prone to the temptations of fact-selectivity than any other discipline, and our current macroeconomic policy debate is no exception.</td>

      <td>The European debate on immigration, integration and Islam has intensified. In part this is a response to terrorist attacks, the preaching of radical Islam, and the re-emergence of extreme right-wing and populist parties. But the big, underlying change has been the influx of migrants from the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.<br />More than 3.7 million people have arrived illegally in Europe since 2009, the majority of whom have applied for asylum. Roughly half arrived in 2015 alone. Two-thirds of the newcomers were male. Around 80% of asylum applicants were under 35. The great majority have come from Muslim-majority countries.<br />The flow of migrants has abated in the past few years, but large numbers of people still attempt to reach Europe, even during the pandemic. Last year Europe saw more than 336,000 first-time asylum applications and 114,300 illegal entries from January through November.<br />One consequence has been a change in the position of women in Europe. Many Muslim migrants don’t feel or express contempt for women. But some do—enough to drive a trend.<br />One shocking event that drew attention to this trend was the wave of sexual assaults on New Year’s Eve 2015-16 in Germany. According to German police, more than 1,200 women were assaulted, of whom 24 said they were raped. The perpetrators often acted in gangs, attacking lone women. Of 153 suspects in the city of Cologne, nearly all were foreign, including 103 from Morocco and Algeria. Sixty-eight were asylum seekers.</td>

The 49-year old exile, who ran a furniture shop in Cape Town, was making a delivery to a customer when he was attacked.<br />Police, who announced their inquiry late Sunday, said a preliminary investigation points to robbery as a motive. But the Rwanda National Congress party, many of whose senior members are living in exile, said the killing was an assassination that followed a pattern of murders ordered by the Rwandan government against opponents inside and outside the country.<br />“While investigations are going on to determine the exact cause of Mr. Bamporiki’s assassination, the incident resembles assassinations that happened before, where the victims were lured by people they knew; but who fatally betrayed them to death,” the party said.<br />A Rwandan government spokesman didn’t respond to calls for comment. The government has denied that it targets dissidents abroad. Some pro-Rwandan government accounts on Twitter blamed the killing on the infighting within the ranks of Rwanda National Congress party.</td>

      <td>A group of activist investors thinks  Kohl’s  can do better, but that may be easier said than done.<br />An investor consortium with a combined 9.5% stake in Kohl’s is attempting to take control of the department-store chain’s board, nominating nine to its 12-person board. The investors are calling for a plan to grow sales and are pitching a sale-leaseback of some of Kohl’s real-estate assets, among other changes.<br />But Kohl’s faces industrywide problems. For more than a decade now, department stores have been losing market share to discounters, which grew quickly starting in the recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis. The pandemic has made things worse with online retail grabbing more share and apparel brands shifting focus to direct-to-consumer sales.<br />In fact, Kohl’s is the best-performing of the struggling bunch, making it a curious target for activists. For the nine-month period ended Oct. 31, 2020, its top line declined 26% from a year earlier.  Macy’s ,   Nordstrom  and  Dillard’s  all lost roughly 35% in the same period. Both operating margins and returns on invested capital declined between 2011 and 2019 at Kohl’s, but its numbers are still mostly better than those peers.<br />Sale-leasebacks could help juice returns for a while, but holding on to assets isn’t such a bad strategy either. Macy’s, for example, managed to raise $3.15 billion in credit last year to bolster liquidity, using its real estate as collateral. The move helped the department-store chain distance itself from bankruptcy.</td>

Elizabeth Dole, and the room collectively had almost seven decades in the Senate.)<br />“It was just Bob and Joe, not Mr. President,” Mr. Dole said in describing their meeting in an interview afterward. The two men, one a working-class kid from Scranton, Pa., and the other a farmland boy from Kansas, overlapped in the Senate for almost a quarter of a century. Mr. Dole eventually became the Republican leader, Mr. Biden a powerful Democratic committee chairman.<br />Yet they have another, more personal bond. Both have survived grievous hardships in their lives. Mr. Dole endured body-shattering wounds on a World War II battlefield, and Mr. Biden the deaths of a wife and two children. Both found ways to march on. So perhaps it isn’t surprising that they have an amicable relationship: “We were friends then, and we are friends now,” Mr. Dole said.<br />Naturally, these two friends discussed why the Senate they both love—and really, all of Washington—doesn’t work better right now. And maybe, as Bob Dole heads into battle once more, this time against cancer at the age of 97, his advice again can offer courage and wisdom to a capital that seems short of both.<br />“We did talk about how we were able to work together in the Senate when we both were there, one a Democrat, one a Republican,” said Mr. Dole. “We worked across the aisle and we compromised. We couldn’t solve everything, but most everything we could work out.”</td>

And the hotel-sales boss is now in marketing.<br />Workers at America’s hotels, restaurants, bars and convention centers have been among the hardest hit during the Covid-19 pandemic. Lockdowns and the lack of travel have caused many gathering places to close or reduce their staff. Since February 2020, the leisure-and-hospitality sector has shed nearly four million people, or roughly a quarter of its workforce. As of January 2021, 15.9% of the industry’s workers remained unemployed; more than any other industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br />As a result, millions of hospitality workers—a group that includes everyone from front-desk clerks to travel managers—are trying to launch new careers. Some have transitioned to roles that tap skills honed over years of public-facing work in high-pressure environments. Others have seized the moment to remake themselves for different occupations. Many remain conflicted about leaving an industry they say continually provides new experiences and engenders lasting relationships.<br />A year ago, Ellen White was head trainer at Public Kitchen on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. There, she schooled the restaurant’s workers on the finer points of high-end service.<br />Ms. White supported herself working in restaurants for nearly two decades while acting, until she was furloughed from her restaurant job when the pandemic took hold last spring.

It also said it had raised more than a half-billion dollars at a valuation of $29.5 billion for the company, a sevenfold increase from a funding round less than a year earlier.<br />However, Roblox’s listing plans hit another snag earlier this month when the Securities and Exchange Commission requested changes to how it accounted for the sale of virtual currency called Robux. The company said those issues have since been addressed.<br />Roblox, founded in 2004, makes a free online platform with tens of millions of games. The company’s user base soared through the pandemic as stay-at-home orders meant more people spending time online. It counted nearly 33 million daily active users last year, up from about 18 million the year prior.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. Treasury may be able to facilitate climate stress tests on U.S. banks and insurers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday, though the tests likely wouldn’t impose capital requirements or limit dividend payouts as existing stress tests do.<br />Ms. Yellen, speaking at the New York Times DealBook conference, said the tests would be carried out by the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators and not the Treasury. But she said the Treasury, which helps shape regulatory policy toward U.S. financial firms, may be able to facilitate the tests.<br />“I think it’s not envisioned that this would have the same status in terms of limiting payouts and capital requirements,” she said, referring to the annual bank stress tests the Federal Reserve already conducts. “But I think they would be very revealing both to regulators and to the firms themselves in terms of managing their own risks.”<br />Ms. Yellen has said she intends to create a hub within the Treasury to review the tax policy incentives and financial stability risks related to climate change and will appoint a senior official to lead the review.<br />Regulators around the world have warned of the dangers climate change poses to the financial system, including the risk of more severe weather events such as flooding or wildfires that threaten physical assets that underpin bank loans. Banks’ business may also be altered as countries reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, including more widespread use of electric vehicles and shifts to renewable energy resources.</td>

      <td>Is it possible to choose which Covid-19 vaccine you get?<br />For now, you’re unlikely to have a choice. Medical experts say it’s important to take whichever vaccine is offered to you, and both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that are currently authorized in the U.S. have been shown to be highly effective at preventing disease. As vaccine supply increases and more options become available in the coming months and years, there may be more scope for doctors to recommend  different types of shots for different populations.<br />Currently, there is a little bit of wiggle room for people who are determined to get one vaccine over another. People who have registered for vaccination can try to call vaccine sites directly to find out whether they have  Pfizer  or Moderna shots. But many places don’t inform people ahead of time about which vaccine they will get during the appointment.<br />In the early stages of the rollout, Pfizer’s vaccine has been more likely to be offered in hospitals, medical centers or large vaccine sites that have the ultracold storage that it was initially believed to need. Moderna’s shots, by contrast, have had less-extreme cold-storage requirements, making them more accessible for smaller pharmacies or offices in addition to larger venues. But now a new study has indicated that Pfizer’s vaccine can be stored and transported at temperatures similar to what a consumer freezer provides. If the FDA approves the change, that should make Pfizer’s vaccine more accessible.<br />If and when the FDA authorizes the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, it’s also likely to help serve areas without access to high-grade cold storage, says Kathleen Neuzil, director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.</td>

      <td>Fubu’s logo-heavy clothes were inescapable in the ’90s, driving a $350 million-a-year business. Nearly 30 years later, the brand is relaunching through licensing deals and collaborations aimed at a younger generation.</td>
      <td>THE FOUR FOUNDERS of Fubu—childhood friends Daymond John, J. Alexander Martin, Keith Perrin and Carlton Brown—never imagined the fashion brand would make it this far. As Mr. Perrin recalls, when the quartet got together in the Hollis neighborhood of Queens in New York to start the label in 1992, “our mindset was we had to make as much money as we can because we don’t know how long this thing is going to last.”<br />Yet last it has. Fubu (an acronym for “For Us, By Us”) is nearing its 30th year in business, remarkable longevity that’s comparable to that of powerhouse brands like  Nike  and Ralph Lauren. The founders admit that Fubu’s public profile has faded in the past decade or so. At its peak, around 1999 to 2002, the company was grossing $350 million a year according to its founders. “We were on such a grand scale in the ’90s and early 2000s that anything less than that, I guess, to our audience felt like we went away,” said Mr. Brown during a recent Zoom interview conducted with all four founders.<br />Over the last few years, the brand has been orchestrating a relaunch the founders hope will appeal to the generation of ’90s babies born after Fubu debuted. The plan has included collaborations with Puma and  Urban Outfitters ,  as well reissues of the sort of baggy logoed gear that was inescapable on MTV and in the pages of XXL magazine through the ‘90s and early 2000s. Most recently, Fubu has relaunched its affordable suiting line in partnership with Karako, a Manhattan tailoring label, and added new licensees in Europe and South Africa.<br />Some Gen-Z style icons have embraced the revitalized Fubu. In January singer Lil Nas X posted a photo on his Instagram of himself wearing a $129 camo Fubu hoodie, while that same month NBAer Kyle Kuzma arrived at a game in a full Fubu corduroy sweatsuit.<br />As the founders tell it, hard-earned lessons from their three decades in business are culminating in this brand refresh. Early on, the foursome was preternaturally skilled at grassroots marketing. Long before social media and influencers who post #sponsored-content, Fubu was seeding free products to everyone from reverends to rappers, expanding its footprint through grassroots outreach. With very low overhead, Fubu managed to get valuable press from musicians in particular. During the heyday of MTV and BET, you could see Fubu clothes in videos for acts like Brand Nubian, Mariah Carey and O.D.B.</td>

      <td>The latest grounding of  Boeing  planes isn’t the start of another 737 MAX debacle. But it is more unwelcome publicity for an already battered U.S. aerospace industry.<br />On Sunday, airlines around the world followed Boeing’s recommendation and stopped flying all 777 jets with engines manufactured by Pratt & Whitney, a division of U.S. conglomerate Raytheon. This followed problems on a United Airlines flight Saturday that scattered engine debris over a Denver suburb. The Federal Aviation Administration will order inspections of all the affected aircraft, given the precedent of a similar incident in 2018.<br />While the extent of the problem is still unclear, it is likely to affect only a subset of a small subset of the global fleet.<br />Pratt is one of three companies to have made turbofan engines for the jet since it started flying in 1994. According to data provider Cirium, only 8.3% of all 777s in operation use the PW4000 engines in question, with another 12% sporting  Rolls-Royce  equivalents. The rest are serviced by  General Electric ,  which has been the exclusive supplier of all the longer-range 777 variants that Boeing has produced since the mid-2000s.<br />United is the top user of Pratt-powered 777s—and the only one in the U.S.—followed by Japanese carriers ANA and  Japan Airlines ,  as well as  Korean Air  and  Asiana Airlines .  Yet the immediate logistical challenges for airlines may be limited. The affected 777s are the kind of big, old jets that airlines have kept in storage during the Covid-19 crisis. Out of 127 in operation, according to Cirium, 67 were already parked.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A new Treasury Department watchdog report warns that law-enforcement agencies may not be on firm legal footing when they use cellphone GPS data drawn from mobile apps without obtaining a warrant first.<br />In a review of the Internal Revenue Service’s use of a commercial platform that allowed the agency to track cellphones, the Treasury Department inspector general for tax administration said that a landmark 2018 Supreme Court case might preclude the warrantless tracking of criminal suspects through location data generated by weather, game and other apps. The report encouraged stricter controls on use of the data.<br />Many government lawyers have concluded that the decision in Carpenter v. United States doesn’t apply because it addresses data held by cellphone carriers that contain a subscriber’s personally identifying information, rather than GPS location data drawn from apps, which doesn’t.<br />The watchdog’s report is only a recommendation, and its interpretation of the law hasn’t been blessed by any court. Yet it is the first known government analysis to raise serious doubt about the legality of law-enforcement and intelligence agencies purchasing highly revealing information generated by U.S. cellphones and other digital services.<br />The audit, requested by Sens. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) and Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), examined the IRS Criminal Investigation division’s use of a commercial software platform provided by Venntel, a company that sells to the government access to GPS data gathered from apps. Venntel’s parent company, Gravy Analytics, caters to corporate clients. The IRS experimented with Venntel’s platform as an investigative tool in 2017 and 2018 but stopped using the software.</td>

The small-scale plant in Fremont, Calif., will make batteries for smaller devices such as radios and smartwatches. Enovix is scouting a location for a second factory that will also build batteries for smartphones, and aims to start selling batteries for electric vehicles after 2025.<br />A longer-lasting, quicker-charging and cheaper battery is essential for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, improved solar-energy storage and advancements in key technologies such as augmented and virtual reality. Enovix has plenty of company:  QuantumScape Corp. , which builds solid-state batteries—a design that is free of liquid, greatly reducing fire hazards—went public last year through a SPAC deal and has a market capitalization of more than $22 billion, though it projects no meaningful revenue before 2026. China-backed Microvast Inc., which builds batteries for electric buses and other commercial vehicles, said this month it would go public through a New York-based SPAC in a deal valued at about $3 billion.<br />A SPAC deal was “the opportunity of the day,” said Enovix Chief Executive Harrold Rust. “But we have got to build the company and hit our numbers, and if we do that I think we will be a valuable company regardless of what the stock market does.”</td>

Boyu’s Singapore office, its first presence outside China, provides a potential refuge from political intrigue within the party, they said, and helps the firm diversify from its base in Hong Kong, where business confidence has been shaken by unrest and Beijing’s efforts to stamp out dissent.<br />Launched a decade ago by Alvin Jiang—the former leader’s grandson—and three co-founders, Boyu has won a reputation for being a well-connected and savvy China-focused investor, whose backers have included Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and Singaporean state investor Temasek Holdings.</td>

Susan Collins said she would oppose Neera Tanden’s nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget, further narrowing her chances of getting confirmed by the Senate.<br />In a statement Monday, Ms. Collins, a moderate from Maine who was among a handful of Republicans who were seen as possibly supporting the nomination, cited Ms. Tanden’s past statements on social media in explaining her decision.<br />“Neera Tanden has neither the experience nor the temperament to lead this critical agency,” Ms. Collins said. “Her past actions have demonstrated exactly the kind of animosity that President Biden has pledged to transcend.”<br />On Friday, Democratic Sen.

A confidential EU paper on Hong Kong, circulated last week and seen by The Wall Street Journal, advocates greater cooperation with the U.S. and other allies in pressuring China.<br />Support for imposing sanctions on Russia has built quickly following a tense trip to Moscow by EU foreign-policy chief Josep Borrell. Mr. Borrell said Monday ahead of the meeting that “it is clear that Russia is in a confrontational course with the European Union.”</td>

In January, 5,707 children arrived at the border alone, up from 4,855 the month before.<br />The numbers are smaller than in 2018 and 2019, when waves of children and families overwhelmed border-patrol stations and migrant shelters.<br />But this time, government capacity is limited: The child-shelter network run by the Department of Health and Human Services to house migrant children has reduced its capacity by 40%, and as of Friday, shelters were 93% full.<br />“They’ve seen very large growth in a very short period of time,” said Mark Greenberg, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan Washington think tank, who oversaw the shelter network during the Obama administration. “The closer you get to 100% capacity, the harder the system is to manage.”</td>

      <td>The highly transmissible Covid-19 virus variant that first emerged in the U.K. can partially evade a commonly used coronavirus test. Some health authorities are using that fact to their advantage.<br />As more-transmissible variants emerge as a concern in the fight against the virus, the vast majority of Covid-19 diagnostic tests haven’t been affected. But for a handful, including one from diagnostics giant  Thermo Fisher Scientific  Inc.,  a section of the test can’t pick up on variants including the U.K. variant that have a specific mutation, the company, laboratories and health officials who have processed its tests said.<br />Yet the other parts of the tests still work. So if a test comes up positive for Covid-19 but that portion of the test fails, that could indicate that the samples contain the U.K. variant. Some laboratories are exploiting the bug to more quickly find cases that might be caused by the fast-spreading variant.<br />“It’s actually been a benefit for public health to be able to monitor,” Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said at an online event last week. “There was a silver lining there.”<br />The tests in question are PCR tests: molecular tests that search for specific portions of the virus’s genetic code and amplify them. They are often performed in a lab. The large majority of Covid-19 diagnostic tests, including both molecular and rapid-antigen tests, are able to flag known Covid-19 virus variants as a positive test result.</td>

The president and his advisers have for weeks been quietly discussing the matter with members of Congress and senior Capitol Hill aides, according to people familiar with the matter, and Mr. Biden is optimistic that a compromise can be reached.<br />The exact contours of the new round of investments in the economy remain to be determined. Mr. Biden during his presidential campaign outlined his interest in new infrastructure investments and measures to combat climate change and boost manufacturing jobs, as well as improving access to child care and seeking ways to increase racial equity.<br />The prospect of another pricey package is already raising concerns among some Republicans. Congressional aides also said that while there is bipartisan interest in funding infrastructure improvements, there will be tension between progressive lawmakers who want expansive proposals that address longstanding Democratic priorities and moderates and Republicans who support less expensive, more tailored measures.</td>

      <td>Macquarie earned a windfall when the deep freeze in Texas sent energy markets into a tailspin</td>
      <td>The deep freeze that plunged millions of Texans into darkness last week produced a windfall of up to $215 million for  Macquarie Group Ltd. , an Australian investment bank that is active in U.S. power and gas markets.<br />The extreme weather froze wind turbines and oil-and-gas wells, closed oil refiners and prompted power stations to trip offline, sending a jolt through energy markets. Wholesale power prices rocketed, as did spot prices for natural gas in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Arkansas.<br />The turbulence led to a bonanza for Macquarie’s commodity traders, who specialize in sending gas and electricity to clients such as utility companies in unusual situations.<br />The bank bumped up its guidance Monday for earnings in the year through March to reflect the windfall. It said that net profit after tax would be 5% to 10% higher than in the 2020 fiscal year. That equates to an increase of up to 273.1 million Australian dollars, equivalent to around $215 million. In its previous guidance, issued Feb. 9, Macquarie said it expected profits to be slightly down on 2020.<br />“Extreme winter weather conditions in North America have significantly increased short-term client demand for Macquarie’s capabilities in maintaining critical physical supply across the commodity complex, and particularly in relation to gas and power,” the bank said.</td>

      <td>In a world changed by the pandemic, the hotel chain’s key to recovery may be mixing business with pleasure</td>
      <td>Marriott International ’s  late Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson, who died last week, told Forbes in 2019 that he wanted his company to be “as big as possible.” His boldest move came back in 2015 when he announced that Marriott would acquire Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, adding brands that appealed to travelers’ interests and values such as design, fashion, youth and productivity. Now Marriott is hoping Mr. Sorenson’s biggest deal can be its savior.<br />If big was Mr. Sorenson’s mission, he succeeded. Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood made it the largest hotel chain in the world. Over the course of Mr. Sorenson’s decade-plus tenure at the top, Marriott’s stock more than tripled, keeping most of his long-term shareholders happy.<br />Until last year, at least, when some of its portfolio’s strengths became its biggest weaknesses. Nearly half of Marriott’s hotel rooms are now in urban areas, while upscale rooms make up about a third of its portfolio. In 2019, 60% of its room nights booked were for business travel. In 2020, the coronavirus hit urban and upscale hotels the hardest in the hotel industry, according to data from hotel-analytics firm STR. Perhaps worst of all, business travel essentially evaporated overnight. At the height of the pandemic in April, Marriott temporarily had to shut more than a quarter of its hotels, while revenue per available room was down 90% year on year.<br />But at least some of Marriott’s die hard investors seem relatively undeterred, even while trends remain severely depressed. On Thursday, Marriott said it swung to its first full-year loss since 2009. It also said occupancy rates in the U.S. and Canada fell from the third to the fourth quarter to just 35%, less than half of the world-wide occupancy levels the company saw in 2019 overall. Meanwhile, the company declined to give a substantive 2021 outlook, except to say that the impact of Covid-19 would continue to be material to its results.<br />Marriott’s stock is up 44% over the past six months and is nearly back to pre-pandemic levels, signaling investors’ faith that its business will fully rebound, and quickly. There are certainly signs this could be the case: Marriott said occupancy rates in mainland China, where the virus has eased, reached 60% in July and remained above that level for the remainder of the year. However, the company also reported high volatility around renewed increases in the virus, noting occupancy in the country has fallen to 40% year-to-date for that reason. That volatility is certainly something investors should keep in mind as they bet on Marriott’s recovery: Analysts aren’t forecasting that Marriott’s revenue will recover to anywhere close to 2019 levels this year.</td>

      <td>Short-term imbalances between supply and demand may justify a 10-year high for copper prices, but staying there would prove more challenging</td>
      <td>Copper prices jumped to just above $9,000 a metric ton in New York in early trading Monday, leaving the metal up 14% this year at its highest level in almost a decade. But wide-eyed talk of a new commodity supercycle is premature.<br />Supercycles are long-running, broad-based commodity bull markets like the one from the late 1990s until the early 2010s. Copper rebounded rapidly after the 2008 crash and didn’t peak until early 2011. But it’s unlikely the favorable conditions that held then will be replicated—particularly in China.<br />During that post-financial-crisis surge in copper prices, China began perhaps the most rapacious expansion of construction in its history: The amount of real estate floor space on which construction began rose by more than 40% in 2010. In 2011, real estate starts were more than twice what they were in 2007.<br />There is little prospect of a repeat performance now. China’s recovery owes more to its near-eradication of Covid-19 for most of 2020 than the sort of no-holds-barred stimulus seen in the U.S. and other developed economies. Indeed, Chinese M2 money supply rose slower than that of the U.S., eurozone, U.K. or Japan last year. The government is concerned with the leverage of major real-estate companies, and households in general, and won’t permit another debt-driven surge in building. Nor is there likely to be a boom in infrastructure investment above what was expected before the pandemic.<br />There are legitimate long-term bullish factors for some commodities, including copper. The metal is needed for electric and hybrid vehicles. But that doesn’t explain why copper is up 45% from pre-pandemic levels, when those long-term applications already were well-known—nor why it is rallying with oil, which certainly won’t benefit from a more decarbonized future.</td>

      <td>How a company uses carbon emission offsets can help identify risky businesses</td>
      <td>Investors need to dig into the details of net-zero emission plans to assess their value and risks. Thankfully there is a handy shortcut.<br />Companies face rising costs of carbon dioxide emissions. European Union credit costs reached a record high of nearly €40 a metric ton, or about $48, this month. Levies of over $100 are expected in many countries by 2030. Given the very limited information available about companies’ carbon footprints and cleanup plans, analyzing how they use CO2 reduction techniques can be a helpful shortcut to identify risky businesses.<br />All industries will be affected, and heavily polluting ones face significant financial risk. Oil and coal producers face existential questions. The challenge is also particularly acute in so-called hard-to-abate industries: airlines, cement, long-haul trucking, plastics, shipping and steel. Many investors would like to distinguish the leaders from the laggards.<br />A commitment to cut emissions is a good start. Nearly 1,400 companies have promised to reduce their net CO2 emissions to zero by 2050, according to the UN’s Race to Zero campaign. However, patchy disclosure of carbon footprints and uncertainty about how markets will evolve over the decades mean investors can struggle to understand a company’s plans and associated risks. Reporting standards will help, once agreed.<br />Meanwhile, one useful indicator is how much a plan relies on carbon reduction techniques or offsets such as planting trees or carbon capture projects. Offsets are widely used, but even some companies in the hard-to-abate sectors, such as global shipping giant Maersk and steel producer  Thyssenkrupp ,  plan to decarbonize without them.</td>

The brand, one of the youngest in the famed sparkling wine region, is known for its metallic bottles that cost hundreds of dollars each.<br />The investment, LVMH and Jay-Z said, is aimed at growing Armand de Brignac through LVMH’s global distribution networks while drawing upon the conglomerate’s vast resources within Champagne wine country. It comes at a difficult moment for Champagne: The pandemic canceled weddings, soirees and other occasions to pop corks, cutting sales of the wine by around 20% last year. The two sides didn’t disclose the value of the transaction.<br />“We were working really hard to maintain a brand that was growing faster than the staff we had and bigger than some of the expertise we had,” Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, said in an interview. “We’d been in this 15 years, not a hundred.”<br />The partnership shows how European luxury brands are now embracing Black recording artists and hip-hop culture to appeal to a younger, more diverse clientele. Rihanna and LVMH launched a cosmetics line, Fenty Beauty. The rapper Gucci Mane and his namesake brand, the Italian fashion house Gucci, have collaborated on a collection. Dior, an LVMH brand, has used the rapper A$AP Rocky as a featured model in several menswear collections. Streetwear has become a staple of luxury fashion.</td>

Now  SoftBank  is hoping for a repeat in South Korea.<br />Coupang, a fast-growing Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010, filed this month for an initial public offering in New York that could come as early as March. It is expected to value Coupang at more than $50 billion, the most for a foreign company since Alibaba in 2014—creating another windfall for SoftBank’s Vision Fund. The Japanese company is a 38% owner, a stake it acquired by investing a total of just $2.7 billion since 2015.<br />Coupang has quickly become Korea’s largest e-commerce player, according to Euromonitor International—booking $12 billion in revenue last year, its IPO prospectus says, compared with $2.4 billion in 2017. While still unprofitable, the company narrowed its losses by about a third last year. Coupang has spent heavily building its own delivery network and fulfillment centers, helping it entice customers with next-day delivery and easy returns.<br />As in other countries, e-commerce grew strongly in Korea during the pandemic. But online shopping has long been popular there, and will account for 28.9% of retail sales in 2021, market researcher eMarketer forecasts—second only to China. Korea’s population density helps: About half of the country’s 52 million people live in Greater Seoul, making it easier for Coupang to achieve the fast delivery it promises.<br />Coupang has unseated  eBay  as the market leader, but the sector remains fragmented. One of the strongest competitors is local giant Naver, whose leading position in search and payments has helped it push into online shopping too. Its e-commerce revenue last year was up 38% from 2019, and it has partners in  CJ Logistics ,  one of Korea’s largest logistics companies, and  BGF Retail ,  which runs its largest convenience-store chain.</td>

The Feb. 1 coup abruptly ended Myanmar’s decadelong democratic shift and returned the country to military rule, with the hugely popular civilian politician Aung San Suu Kyi detained in her house and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces in absolute control. Hundreds of others have since been detained, including politicians and activists, and nights bring internet blackouts and the fear of police raids and other attacks.<br />Monday’s massive turnout, accompanied by the closure of many shops and other places of work, comes after police fired on protesters on Saturday, killing two people. More than 30 others were injured in the incident, which took place in the city of Mandalay. A message on state-run TV late Sunday warned that protesters were pushing people down a path of confrontation where they would suffer a loss of life.<br />The demonstrations don’t have a leader, but participants have mobilized crowds using phone calls, texts, live-streaming, messaging apps like Signal and social-media websites to exchange plans and alert fellow protesters.<br />Arising at 5 a.m. Monday, Thaw Zin drove around Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, to map out the locations of police barricades, street closures and convoys of military vehicles—details he shared with a core group of friends, whom he calls “proliferators of information,” who in turn relayed the tidbits to others to help plan the day’s demonstrations. An hour later, he was at a prominent protest site, hanging up posters from an overpass before police arrived.</td>

      <td>China’s banking regulator formalized rules that will force Ant Group Co. and other online lenders to have more skin in the game when they make loans with banks, dealing a blow to a burgeoning business that helped drive Chinese consumer spending in recent years.<br />Starting in 2022, internet-lending platforms in the country will have to fund at least 30% of every loan they make jointly with commercial lenders, which include banks, trust companies, and finance companies. Individual banks will also be subject to new caps on how much they can lend together with online partners, according to regulations published on Saturday by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.<br />Several analysts on Monday said the rules are aimed at large technology companies including Ant and WeBank, a large online lender backed by  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  Both have become big originators of unsecured loans to individuals and small businesses by working with dozens of commercial lenders that supply most of the funds. Ant and WeBank declined to comment.<br />Ant, in particular, has come under intense regulatory scrutiny since its blockbuster initial public offerings were pulled in early November last year. The owner of Alipay, which has more than a billion users in China, has partnered with around 100 commercial lenders, including many small regional banks and trust companies, to make loans to hundreds of millions of individuals, raking in large profits in the process.<br />At the end of June 2020, Ant had the equivalent of $267 billion in outstanding consumer loans, accounting for nearly a fifth of the country’s outstanding short-term household debt. Just 2% of that total was funded by the Hangzhou-based company. Its consumer-lending services, Huabei and Jiebei, have supplied credit to many free-spending young people in China who don’t qualify for bank-issued credit cards.</td>

It doesn’t disclose how much it spent on the bonds.<br />Both the Bank of England and the ECB are buying corporate bonds to keep credit markets functioning smoothly after the coronavirus pandemic dealt a blow to the global economy.

      <td>WASHINGTON—Judge Merrick Garland, President Biden’s pick for attorney general, is expected to get a bipartisan welcome before the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday, where he will promise to combat a rising threat of domestic extremism and stress the need for an independent Justice Department.<br />The very fact that Judge Garland is getting a hearing itself signals changed times. In 2016, Senate Republicans refused to grant him one after President Barack Obama nominated him for the Supreme Court. Republicans and Democrats alike are hailing the nominee, who spearheaded domestic terrorism investigations for the Justice Department in the 1990s, as expertly qualified both to fight the threat of extremist violence and to restore morale, stability and institutional integrity to a Justice Department roiled by political storms in recent years.<br />The federal judge and former prosecutor will highlight critical tasks that he would take on if confirmed, including overseeing the prosecution of “white supremacists and others” involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to prepared remarks released over the weekend.<br />Judge Garland would also pursue strong enforcement of civil-rights law, citing the Justice Department’s original mission to enforce amendments that provided broader rights and protections for Black Americans that grew out of the Civil War.<br />“That mission remains urgent because we do not yet have equal justice,” he plans to say. “Communities of color and other minorities still face discrimination in housing, education, employment, and the criminal justice system; and bear the brunt of the harm caused by pandemic, pollution, and climate change.”</td>

      <td>Shares of small companies are outpacing their larger counterparts by the widest margin in more than two decades. Behind their rise: confidence among investors that heavy stimulus and coronavirus vaccine deployment will boost the economy.<br />The Russell 2000 Index of small companies has climbed 15% and set 10 closing records so far this year, well above the S&P 500’s 4% rise. That is the largest such gap between the two indexes through Feb. 19 since 2000, according to Dow Jones Market Data.<br />The leadership by small companies goes back even further. Over the past six months, they are beating the S&P 500 by nearly 30 percentage points as investors anticipate greater fiscal spending from the Biden administration.<br />Among some of the biggest gainers: hydrogen fuel-cell company  Plug Power Inc.,  fast-food chain  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc.  and retailer  Macy’s Inc.  All three stocks have more than doubled in the past six months and are up at least 30% in 2021.<br />Smaller companies are more tied to the domestic economy than their large-cap counterparts, which make more money overseas. Economically sensitive sectors such as energy, materials and banking also account for more of the Russell 2000 than larger indexes. These cyclical groups were battered by the pandemic but are now powering markets to records.</td>

They sent workers home, and brought them back again. They held emergency meeting after emergency meeting. They shared their own homes and lives with staff in video calls and personal words. They tried to save the world, through vaccines and bleach wipes or even just getting folks enough toilet paper.<br />This was leading a company in 2020, through the worst crisis most bosses have witnessed in their careers. Working through it was often painful, but there are things we can learn from all of it—the actions of upstarts and veterans, the missteps and failures, and the groundbreaking wins.<br />The Wall Street Journal’s Leadership Lessons From the Covid-19 Crisis, available to download for Journal subscribers, spotlights how leaders adapted to a challenge unprecedented in our modern times, including takeaways from their experiences.<br />The tactics on display include both old-school styles harking back to the days of Jack Welch (see  Emerson Electric ’s  David Farr), and more modern approaches. I’m all for the new wave of empathetic leadership that we’ve seen some executives move toward recently, but these case studies suggest there are circumstances that call for nonstop hours, tough feedback and seemingly impossible goals, as was the case at  Moderna ,  which developed a Covid-19 vaccine. Keep it fair, of course, but when the whole world is watching, and the outcome is literally a matter of life and death, sometimes you need a hard-charging leader pushing you forward.</td>

These seats would be given to some of the more than 200 Hong Kong-resident members of China’s top political advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the people said.<br />The plan is part of sweeping changes presaged by the chief of Beijing’s office on Hong Kong affairs, Xia Baolong, in a speech on Monday in which he said that Hong Kong’s executive, legislature and judiciary must comprise “true patriots.” In his first public speech after taking the office in early 2020, Mr. Xia called anyone who opposes the governments of China or Hong Kong “destroyers” who shouldn’t be able to exert influence in the future.<br />Mr. Xia didn’t specify any proposed electoral changes, but the people familiar with the plans said details of the legislation are being completed ahead of the March 5 opening of the National People’s Congress, China’s legislature. Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who has a low public-approval rating, hasn’t said whether she intends to run for a second five-year term next year.</td>

Declining bond prices result in rising yields, which have stoked concern that highflying stocks are starting to look less attractive than assets considered to be risk free.<br />“As the yield goes up, there is more demand for [government bonds] in relation to other assets,” said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. “How much are you willing to pay for stocks?

Mr. Ryu’s defection in 2019 occurred just two months after Pyongyang’s acting ambassador to Rome, Jo Song Gil, defected to Seoul.<br />The number of recent ambassador-level defections from North Korea shows Kim Jong Un’s control over the regime’s bureaucracy may not be as strong as his father’s or grandfather’s, said Cheon Seong-whun, a former South Korean national security official. However, he cautioned against reading too much into the defections as a sign of the regime’s fragility.<br />“We should be wary of interpreting the series of defections as a sign of weakness of the Kim Jong Un regime,” Mr. Cheon said. Most North Koreans have a tendency to rally around their leader against outside pressure, he said.</td>

Republican lawmakers are talking about impeachment, but Democrats dismissed their effort as disingenuous.<br />On Thursday, lawmakers from both parties said they would publicly grill State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker over the state’s delay in releasing a fuller tally of nursing-home deaths as well as a controversial March 25 department directive that said nursing homes couldn’t refuse to admit Covid-positive patients.<br />Mr. Cuomo and his aides have responded forcefully to critical lawmakers both recently and over the course of his time in office, and the governor said on Friday that he would be more aggressive in addressing critics of his actions on nursing homes. Dr. Zucker said the March 25 directive was consistent with federal guidance at the time and was necessary to preserve hospital capacity.<br />But pressure tactics that normally happen in private are bursting into public view and, some legislators said, have only steeled their positions.</td>

      <td>His administration appears to have engaged in a coverup to frustrate federal oversight.</td>
      <td>The Cuomo administration’s alleged misreporting of nursing-home deaths in New York is serious, perhaps meriting federal criminal charges.<br />On March 25, 2020, Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order requiring New York nursing homes to admit hospitalized patients who had tested positive for Covid-19. The order also prohibited nursing homes from requiring hospitalized residents deemed “medically stable” to be tested before admission or readmission. By the end of the summer New York had more than 32,000 Covid deaths, the highest in the nation and more than double any other state. If New York were its own country, it would have ranked among the top 10 for Covid deaths. The number of deaths translated to the country’s second-highest death rate—more than three times the national average.<br />What caught the Justice Department’s eye was Gov. Cuomo’s claim that New York’s nursing-home deaths were lower than many other states’ and that his March 25 order didn’t contribute to the extremely high number of New Yorkers who died from Covid. Given the virus’s disproportionate effect on the elderly, sick and frail, this seemed unlikely. On Aug. 26, Justice’s Civil Rights Division, relying on its jurisdiction to investigate government-run facilities under the federal Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, asked the Cuomo administration for data on New York’s publicly run nursing homes, which account for less than 5% of nursing homes in the state.<br />In September, New York produced data showing it had underreported Covid deaths in government-run nursing homes by a third. The undercounting appeared to be due to several factors. First, when a nursing-home resident who contracted Covid died after being transported to a hospital for treatment, New York didn’t count it as a “nursing-home death.” Second, New York didn’t include deaths occurring before the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began requiring Covid reporting from nursing homes in mid-May. CMS made reporting prior Covid deaths optional, and New York apparently elected to keep the information to itself.<br />But New York officials knew the data they reported to CMS only went back to mid-May. The Cuomo administration misled the public when it relied on that data to claim in late September that the state’s total nursing-home deaths were low.</td>

      <td>Speculative manias are in the air, as evidenced by the recent price surges for bitcoin, a digital asset with a fundamental value of zero, and  GameStop ,  a declining retailer. Along with the other economic trends—a strong recovery, surging commodity prices and an uptick in inflation—those asset bubbles have a clear cause: the massive expansion of money and credit.<br />Yet America’s fiscal and monetary masters are turning a blind eye. They are focused solely on mending the labor market. With the fervor of messiahs, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen tell us the only way to save the labor market and reach full employment is to continue to pour fiscal and monetary fuel on the fire. But their prescriptions and prophecies, modeled on the playbook of the 2008 financial crisis, are not valid today.<br />After that crisis, the Fed began quantitative easing, which massively expanded its balance sheet. At the same time, commercial banks were busy shrinking their loan books and writing off losses from mortgage debt and securities, which meant the Fed’s injections did little more than offset the contraction of commercial bank balance sheets. As a result, money growth from 2010-19, as measured by the Fed’s broadest money measure, M2, averaged only 5.8% a year.<br />While money on the Fed’s books grew rapidly, money in the hands of the public grew slowly. Spending and inflation were restrained, and the postcrisis recovery was anemic with inflation persistently below the Fed’s target. In contrast, China’s money-supply growth exploded in 2009 and 2010, averaging 23% a year. China achieved a strong recovery as a result, but also a jump in inflation, which moved from minus 1.8% in July 2009 to 6.5% by July 2011. Money matters.<br />Fast-forward to February 2020. Since then, the quantity of money in the U.S. economy, measured by M2, has increased by an astonishing $4 trillion. That’s a one-year increase of 26%—the largest annual percentage increase since 1943.</td>

      <td>Companies won’t make permanent investments in new employees based on temporary revenue.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration says if Congress passes the proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill, we won’t have to “wait for years for the economy to return to full employment,” as two members of the Council of Economic Advisers put it in a recent White House blog post.<br />It’s the right goal. In April 2017, the unemployment rate dipped below what the Congressional Budget Office projected as full employment. It stayed there until the pandemic. That created intense competition for employees and drove wage growth at or above 3% for 20 consecutive pre-pandemic months. By 2019 median family income hit a record high, the poverty rate declined to a record low, and income inequality decreased for the second year in a row.<br />The jobs picture is all but certain to improve in a year when people are getting vaccinated and states are opening their economies. The labor market will improve in the coming months if the government does nothing. But massive spending will hurt more than it helps.<br />Business owners recognize that government spending can put more money into circulation and may result in increased sales. But they also know that government largess—no matter how generous—is finite. If you believe a revenue source is going to dry up, you don’t invest in growth and hiring based on its continuing.<br />Say you owned a restaurant and sales increased because your competitor next door burned down, but he had insurance and would rebuild. You’d certainly appreciate the increased sales, but you wouldn’t hire more permanent employees, because you know the increased revenue is temporary.</td>

Greg Abbott’s decision last week to ban natural-gas exports to Mexico temporarily was shortsighted and counterproductive for his state.<br />This isn’t to dismiss the suffering in Texas. But Northern Mexico, which was also in the deep freeze, is the Lone Star State’s largest trading partner and its biggest market for natural-gas exports. Trying to use a state edict to cut off Mexican power generators in a crisis was a public admission that in Texas’s eyes, customers south of the border don’t rate.<br />As the cold snap ends, gas exports will resume and life will go on as before for Texas gas suppliers. But Mr. Abbott has handed Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador a cudgel with which to beat Mexico’s economic liberals, who opened energy markets to private investment and trade in 2014. It is their fault, AMLO argues, that Mr. Abbott has the power to leave them shivering in the dark.<br />This claim is nowhere near the truth—I’ll get to that in a minute—but AMLO used it last week to launch a new blitzkrieg against energy competition, foreign and domestic, in Mexico. The world-class demagogue from Tabasco, who thrives on nationalism, now has the bit in his mouth. Over time it could cost Texas gas suppliers.<br />The Abbott decree was likely not even legal. “Force majeure” clauses in contracts might allow the interruption of shipments due to an act of God. But a governor doesn’t have jurisdiction to shut down international trade unilaterally.</td>

      <td>Even when TV was a ‘vast wasteland,’ it brought us together.</td>
      <td>Newton Minow famously called television a “vast wasteland”: “a procession of game shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, western bad men, western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons. And endlessly, commercials. . . . And most of all, boredom.”<br />That was 60 years ago. Today the options are far more vast, and many of them are of high quality. But we’ve lost something: With so many viewing options, TV is no longer America’s great common denominator.<br />In 1961, when Mr. Minow became chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the three most-watched television programs were westerns: “Wagon Train,” “Bonanza” and “Gunsmoke.” Each was seen weekly by roughly 1 in 3 Americans. Wasteland or not, it was part of a sweeping shared experience.<br />When I looked at Nielsen’s top 10 list of most-viewed series for 2020, I was surprised to discover that I had watched only three—and two of them were NFL football. My editor at the Journal had seen only the same three. (The third was the NBC drama “This Is Us.”) Neither of us has watched the two most popular scheduled nonsports series, the  CBS  crime dramas “NCIS,” with a 5.0 rating, and “FBI,” with 4.2. The numbers represent the percentage of homes with television that tuned in. In 1961 the rating for “Gunsmoke” was 37.3.<br />The issue isn’t whether cop shows are aesthetically better than cowboy shows. And it’s not as if Americans are watching less TV; in fact, adults view 4 hours and 8 minutes of television every day, according to Nielsen. When you add in other forms of “video time,” the total jumps to nearly 6 hours. (The pandemic drove up the number by about 35 minutes a day.)</td>

      <td>The pioneer of head-transplant surgery believed that the soul resides in the brain and could be rescued from physically compromised bodies.</td>
      <td>The “title characters” of Brandy Schillace’s admirable biography “Mr. Humble and Dr. Butcher: A Monkey’s Head, the Pope’s Neuroscientist, and the Quest to Transplant the Soul” were one and the same person: Robert J. White, a distinguished neurosurgeon, an accomplished neuroscientist and a man dedicated to searching for the means to transplant souls by transplanting the human brain. If this makes White sound macabre, Ms. Schillace’s account of his life, work and temperament is anything but. She deftly persuades the reader to take White seriously (he wasn’t even eccentric) and to ponder profound medical-scientific-philosophical issues. Best of all, the book is fascinating.<br />White (1926-2010)—blue-collar, middle-class, born in Duluth, Minn.—was, in many ways, a model American. He enlisted in the Army during World War II and served in the medical corps. Afterward he received a full scholarship to Harvard Medical School and in 1953 graduated with full honors. He subsequently enrolled in the University of Minnesota’s neuroscience program and completed his Ph.D. In 1961 he moved with his family (he and his wife would have 10 children) to Cleveland, where he founded the neurosurgery department and brain-research lab at Metropolitan General Hospital.<br />White’s contribution to mainstream medicine was groundbreaking and enduring. He played a seminal role in the medical use of “localized hypothermic cerebral perfusion”—putting the brain on ice, so to speak, to provide surgeons with the necessary time to repair it. Perfusion is now commonplace—it is also used in cardiac surgery—and has saved the lives of countless individuals who would otherwise have died. By the end of his life, White, a superb surgeon, had operated thousands of times, was loved by his patients and their families, advised two popes on bioethical matters, had written hundreds of articles and won numerous honors. He thought it important to make himself available to the press (perhaps too available: one headline read “Monkeys Help Doctor Get ‘Ahead’ ”) and popular culture (he was a consultant on the 2008 movie “X-Files: I Want to Believe”).<br />But Ms. Schillace didn’t write this book to chronicle the life of a routinely establishment physician. Even as a young man, White, a devout Catholic, was convinced that the soul was located in the brain, what the author describes as “three pounds of gelatinous convolutions and a hundred billion nerves.” White felt it was his religious and medical duty to devise techniques for rescuing healthy brains from otherwise diseased and dying bodies. His solution was to transplant heads (containing their brains) onto cadavers that were brain dead but otherwise physiologically viable.<br />Before he could attempt such surgery on people, White experimented, mostly on monkeys, dozens of times, to ascertain and refine the necessary procedures. In March 1970 he succeeded in transplanting a monkey’s head onto another monkey’s body. (A warning: Ms. Schillace’s descriptions of surgery are very detailed.) The transported head didn’t survive long, but the important thing for White was that sensors revealed electrical impulses emanating from the resettled brain. White believed that only brain death—the cessation of the brain’s electrical signals—meant true death. Therefore the monkey whose head was relocated, while its brain was still active, was, in White’s opinion, actually alive. He couldn’t wait to start on human transplants.</td>

      <td>Mayo Clinic, like many health providers, has been pushed to its limits by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its intensive-care units were often filled to or near capacity in 2020. And while doctors throughout the health system rushed to find ways to care for the wave of sick patients infected by the new virus, many of the medical and support staff were being sent home to work remotely.<br />The information-technology team led by Mayo Clinic Chief Information Officer Cris Ross faced immense challenges. Practically overnight, remote, secure and fast access to multiple systems had to be provided to thousands of workers, including doctors. The influx of Covid patients, meanwhile, needed to be able to communicate with the outside world while being kept in isolation. And it all had to be done on the fly. Adapting the healthcare system’s networks and building new tools to meet these demands required planning, decisions and execution at speeds undreamed of a short time before.<br />Mr. Ross spoke to The Wall Street Journal about his IT department’s efforts to support Mayo’s staff and how the pandemic is changing the way his team provides IT to the organization. Here are edited excerpts of the discussion.<br />WSJ: What was the biggest lesson you learned?<br />MR. ROSS: Sometimes we have an expectation that if we’re going to make a change, it’s going to take months and months—that we have to step slowly and carefully. But with the pandemic, we were forced to make decisions in weeks or days. We’ve discovered that when necessity requires rapid decisions and fast action, we can do it.</td>

      <td>The U.S. officially rejoined the Paris climate accord on Friday to much media and European applause. Our guess is that China is the most pleased because it knows the accord will restrict American energy while Beijing gets a decade-long free ride.<br />Paris is a voluntary agreement, and nations submit their own commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. The Obama Administration vowed to slash emissions 26% or more from 2005 levels by 2025, but the Trump Administration withdrew from the accord. President Biden has now pledged to reach “net-zero emissions no later than 2050.”<br />Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Biden is committing the U.S. without submitting the Paris agreement to the Senate as a treaty. They know it would never get a two-thirds vote for approval, and probably not even a simple majority. Yet the Administration will cite Paris to justify sweeping environmental regulations to raise the cost of fossil fuels and subsidize renewable energy and electric vehicles. It will bypass Congress for much of this.<br />The economic damage will be real. A 2017 analysis of the Obama Paris commitments, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Council for Capital Formation, predicted a $250 billion reduction in GDP and some 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025.<br />Meanwhile, China emitted nearly twice as much CO2 as the U.S. in 2018. Yet under Paris, Beijing gets a pass to increase its emissions until 2030. In 2020 China’s coal plants produced some 4,874 terawatt hours of energy—an increase of nearly 15% since it joined the pact, according to S&P Global Platts.</td>

Yet despite that domestic day of infamy, he’ll undoubtedly be the party’s kingmaker now, though it’s an open question whether he could rise like a phoenix to become the party’s standard-bearer again.<br />One thing is certain: With President Biden in the White House doing the radical Democrats’ bidding on every front, one can readily envision a redux of Trumpism in 2024, sans the sizzling melodrama of its progenitor.<br />James Hyland<br />Beechhurst, N.Y.</td>

      <td>Regarding your editorial “Emmanuel Macron and the Woke” (Feb. 18): While I welcome French President Macron’s apparent opposition to “wokeness,” far from restoring “classical liberal values,” he is forcing through a law that effectively renders home schooling illegal for most parents. Just as the German government in 1938 threatened parents with prison if they did not send their children to school from age 6, France will soon require all children from age 3 to attend school or else. Few truly independent options exist, as even the Catholic schools follow the state curriculum with full state funding.<br />Defenders of the law reiterate the view of French revolutionary Georges Danton in 1793 that children belong not first to their parents but to the state. MPs have acknowledged that they know they are taking away a fundamental right by seeking to make home schooling very difficult, but they forge ahead despite all evidence that this move is disproportionate and unnecessary to combat Islamic radicalism. The current law, which includes an in-home inspection of home-schooled children each year, is amply sufficient for detecting any madrasa-style “home schooling.” Having cited ad nauseam the example of 15 children found being radicalized, half of whom were registered as “home-schooled,” the government unjustly tars all 62,000 home-schooled children in France with the same brush.<br />The architects of recent terrorist attacks overwhelmingly have been products of the French (or Belgian) school system, none of them home-schooled. Mr. Macron’s totalitarian instincts are as troubling as those of the jihadists.<br />Priscilla Larkin Harris<br />Ghlin, Belgium</td>

Instead, the auto makers’ extreme focus on cost optimization and lean manufacturing meant eliminating these valuable supply-chain partners. The focus on lean should have been balanced with a pragmatic view on the extreme cost of idled automotive production lines. To shut down production lines for $80,000 vehicles because of a missing $2 microcontroller is catastrophic.<br />Products like semiconductors that have longer lead times and large production lot sizes need distribution for efficient buffering between the manufacturers and end customers. Semiconductors have extremely long and complex production cycles that can range from 10 to 26 weeks. Once a production cycle is begun, large quantities of the same product flow in lots through a semiconductor-manufacturing line that pop out at the end in a burst. Highest volume customers (e.g., smartphone manufacturers) can efficiently receive product directly from a manufacturer. For lower volume, high-mix customers like automotive and industrial, distributors buffer inventory to match a customer’s demand for a steady flow of product to the long production cycles of semiconductor manufacturing and also provide many value-added services.<br />The collaboration between authorized distributors and automotive manufacturers presents a wealth of opportunity to minimize future disruptions.<br />David Loftus<br />President and CEO</td>

      <td>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sidestepped questions over whether his country agreed to pay Russia to provide coronavirus vaccines to Syria as a part of a prisoner swap between the two Middle Eastern countries.<br />Mr. Netanyahu confirmed Saturday night that negotiations with Russia took place as part of efforts to bring back an Israeli woman stuck in Syria. He said he had spoken twice with Russian President Vladimir Putin to hammer out the deal, but denied that Israel provided its own vaccines for it.<br />“I want to say that not even one Israeli vaccine went for this thing,” said Mr. Netanyahu. “We brought back the woman. I’m happy we did this. I thank President Putin that we did this. And more than this I won’t add because that was the Russian request.”<br />The deal was first reported by a U.S.-based blogger, Richard Silverstein, and the  New York Times ,  who said that Israel secretly agreed to pay Russia to send vaccines to Syria to secure the return of the Israeli woman.<br />Israel has described the exchange as a standard prisoner swap. The prime minister didn’t deny buying the Russian vaccines, however, and a person familiar with the deal said that was part of the arrangement.</td>

      <td>Michael J. Meehan and friends started buying a tech company’s shares, but from each other, driving up the price on each trade. Others noticed the rising stock and started buying too, sending shares to more than $100. Then everyone piled in until it hit around $500 at its peak. Sound familiar?  GameStop ? AMC? Nope. It was RCA, pumped by the so-called Radio Pool in 1928-29.<br />Pump-and-dump schemes and roving gangs of investors are an age-old problem. In the 1930s, Congress made these stock pools illegal. Problem solved, right? Ha ha, sure—just like last week’s Roaring Kitty congressional hearings will “fix” the latest iteration. To be fair, RCA was successful and radios really were the future. No matter, after the crash the stock hit $10.<br />For a pump and dump to work, you need a certain type of investor—specifically, the type P.T.

To be nice, let’s call them dupes. “Greater fools” works too.<br />On Feb. 2, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy tweeted, “I have officially sold all my meme stocks. I lost 700kish. Vlad and company stole it from me and should be in jail”—Vlad Tenev being the founder of the stock-trading app Robinhood.

      <td>Chinese policy makers have been floating an implausible theory: The novel coronavirus didn’t originate in China but was imported from Europe. That’s what a former chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention told an academic conference last fall. One theory is the virus rode into Wuhan on frozen-food packaging.<br />This month the World Health Organization visited China to investigate the origins of the virus. A member of the WHO delegation said it's “possible that a frozen carcass could have been shipped” to China and introduced the virus, giving some validation to the food-packaging idea. Reporting has suggested that China required the WHO to agree it would investigate the food hypothesis as a condition of entering Wuhan. By lending credence to this improbable theory, WHO is damaging trust in the important project of figuring out where the virus originated.<br />The most common culprit cited by Chinese officials is frozen salmon, though officials have also suggested the virus may have hitched a ride on frozen cod, pig heads or other products. In response, Beijing has suspended imports of some food products and introduced inspections and tests of frozen food, which has frequently held up imports from the U.S. and Europe.<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration weighed in last week with a forceful statement. “There is no credible evidence of food or food packaging associated with or as a likely source of viral transmission,” the Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcocksaid in a Covid update on Thursday.<br />Other scientific bodies have reached similar conclusions. The International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods has stated: “Despite the billions of meals and food packages handled since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, to date there has not been any evidence that food, food packaging or food handling is a source or important transmission route.” More than 100 million cases of Covid have been diagnosed world-wide and, outside China, not a single case has been traced to food or food packaging.</td>

The Biden administration has called the project a “bad deal,” but Nord Stream 2 is shaping into a pressure point between the new administration and a bipartisan Congressional coalition that has assailed the project.<br />The report was expected to provide a list of companies involved in pipeline construction and are therefore subject to U.S. sanctions. Instead, the State Department named two entities previously sanctioned by the Trump administration—the main pipe-laying vessel and its owner—along with 18 companies, mostly insurers, that already have left or were leaving the project.<br />The failure to name any new targets for sanctions allows the work to continue while also providing the administration with time for discussions with Germany about the project and to formulate its own policy on the pipeline.</td>

Companies considering opening additional offices and dedicated to more hiring diversity can bridge this gap by locating new facilities in areas where there are a large concentration of Black workers who have the relevant skills.”<br />McKinsey studied detailed employment data for more than 3,000 U.S. counties and cross-referenced it with internal corporate data and interviews inside companies. What emerges is a comprehensive picture of Black representation in corporate America—and the challenges that remain for both workers and organizations.<br />Mr. Manyika recently spoke with The Wall Street Journal.

      <td>Conventional wisdom says the best time to go to business school is in your 20s, after working a few years, perhaps while you are still single and trying to move up in the corporate world.<br />Some M.B.A. students beg to differ. In fact, the experiences of graduates with untraditional or non-business backgrounds show that the degree can help mid-career individuals parlay expertise in areas such as science or the military into business leadership. It also can help in the transition from the public to the private sector at any age.<br />Many M.B.A. programs have sought candidates from different backgrounds in recent years, especially as businesses look to hire a more diverse workforce. Schools have said that waiving their standardized-test requirements, including the GMAT exam, for this year removes a hurdle for untraditional students. Some top programs also have plans to diversify applicant pipelines.<br />In 2020, the percentage of two-year M.B.A. applicants with six or more years of work experience increased to 32% from 17% in 2019, according to the nonprofit Graduate Management Admission Council. The share of candidates with 10 or more years of experience rose to 19% from 7% a year ago.<br />Applications to M.B.A. programs, in general, soared this past year as students from a variety of backgrounds sought places to ride out the pandemic-induced recession. Students typically flock to business schools and other graduate programs during economic downturns to sit out a tough job market and gain credentials. M.B.A. program applications had fallen for five straight years because of a hot job market and high tuition costs.</td>

      <td>GameStop  mania has spilled over into a popular exchange-traded fund, as the WallStreetBets craze reaches beyond shares favored on social media.<br />The fund,  State Street ’s  SPDR S&P Retail ETF, was created in 2006 to give investors broad exposure to mall-store firms. Its shares have surged 23% this year, far outstripping a 4% gain in the S&P 500, despite the uncertain outlook for retail. Behind those gains are the traders who congregate on social-media platforms such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum and whose enthusiasm has turned this mundane investment into a roller coaster.<br />On Jan. 27, GameStop soared 135%, driven by events such as Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeting “Gamestonk.” The State Street fund jumped 42% the same day. The next day, GameStop shares tumbled 44% and the fund, known by its ticker XRT, dropped about 9%.<br />On Jan. 28, the fund suffered its largest single-day outflow in more than a decade, according to FactSet. Three-quarters of the money in the fund flowed out, amounting to $506 million in redemptions, driven in part by what some analysts describe as a frantic rush by traders to liquidate the ETF—whose price at times traded at discounts rarely seen in this part of the world—to get their hands on underlying GameStop shares.<br />The whipsaw trading highlights how the mania in WallStreetBets favorites like GameStop can drive pricing in other investments, in this case one typically preferred by investors seeking portfolio diversification and targeted exposure to industry sectors. GameStop shares, long viewed as an also-ran by many investors in a world dominated by  Amazon  and  Costco ,  at one point this year accounted for 20% of the State Street fund.</td>

Stuck near historic lows for most of last year, Treasury yields have climbed in recent months along with investors’ expectations for a strong economic rebound, driven in part by more debt-financed government spending.<br />Rising yields, which result from falling bond prices, often reflect investors’ expectations of faster growth and an accompanying rise in inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of bonds’ fixed payments and can eventually lead the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. More government borrowing also can boost yields by increasing the supply of bonds. Though many investors are keeping an eye on inflation data, analysts and portfolio managers say so far there is little reason to believe price levels will rise enough to prompt the Fed to raise rates any time soon, which looms as perhaps the greatest risk to major stock indexes.<br />“The market has principally been saying, ‘Hooray, the pandemic is coming under control and the economy is starting to grow again,’” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, an investment adviser and brokerage firm. “But now we’re actually starting to see the consequences of that in the form of higher rates, and I think the market’s processing that.”<br />As of Friday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note stood at 1.344%, up from 1.157% just five trading sessions earlier and roughly 0.9% at the start of the year.</td>

And District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine, a Democrat, “is investigating whether former President Trump or any other individual violated district law and illegally incited violence on Jan. 6,” according to a spokeswoman, though his authority is more limited.<br />Prosecutors would face clear challenges in bringing any case, according to former prosecutors and experts.<br />Tom Firestone, a lawyer with Baker & McKenzie LLP and former assistant U.S. attorney in New York, said prosecutors would have to consider several factors, including whether Mr. Trump was engaged in constitutionally protected political speech or instead crossed a line that prompted supporters to commit violence. “If you look at his speech, there’s evidence that both sides could use,” Mr. Firestone said.<br />Other important considerations would include Mr. Trump’s intent, what he knew about his supporters’ intentions, and whether the attack on the Capitol was reasonably foreseeable under the circumstances. “I think all of these factors would make it a difficult prosecution, though not an impossible one,” Mr. Firestone said.</td>

Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal may have come of age as generational rivals, captivating the sport, and harnessing much of its good will, but as the years go on, and bodies weary, it may be Djokovic—the third man in, and a historic talent himself—who stands alone.<br />On Sunday, Djokovic won the Australian Open men’s final, his 18th major tournament victory, rolling over Daniil Medvedev 7-5, 6-2, 6-2, putting him two majors behind Federer and Nadal, who both have 20. At 33, Djokovic is about a year younger than Nadal, and more than six years younger than Federer, who will be 40 when the U.S. Open rolls around in late summer. Djokovic owns lifetime winning records against both—he’s 29-27 against Nadal, 27-23 against Federer.<br />Nothing should be assumed in tennis—injuries can happen at any time, and the mental stress of an individual, globe-circling sport isn’t insignificant. Great players can and have suddenly walked away. It will be interesting to see what condition Federer is in when he returns this spring, after nearly a year away, recuperating from a knee injury, and if there’s a chance he can add a couple more. There’s part of me that thinks Nadal could keep dropping in and winning the French Open into his late 30s and early 40s, like some kind of clay-court version of Tom Brady—or better yet, in the way the aging golfer Fred Couples stays relevant at Augusta, because he knows the joint so well.<br />But if Djokovic continues to power along, staying healthy, he may soon be atop the major mountaintop.<br />“The question that comes out of this match is simple,” John McEnroe said on ESPN after Djokovic prevailed Sunday. “Is he going to be the greatest player that ever lived, or is it going to be Roger or Rafa?”</td>

The U.K. has given the third-highest number of vaccination doses per 100 people, according to Oxford University-based OurWorldInData.org, behind Israel and the United Arab Emirates.<br />The fast pace of inoculations, combined with the passage of a Brexit deal at the end of last year, after a period when it appeared the U.K. could crash out of the European Union without one, has led some investors to reassess their expectations of U.K. assets.<br />Hedge funds had largely neutral net positions on sterling’s prospects at the end of last year.

Now, with vaccine rollouts delayed in some places and new virus strains appearing, it is looking more likely that international travel could be stalled for years.<br />After declaring that 2020 was the worst year for tourism on record, with one billion fewer international arrivals, the United Nations World Tourism Organization says prospects for a 2021 rebound have worsened. In October, 79% of experts polled by the agency believed a 2021 rebound was possible. Only 50% said they believed that in January, and some 41% didn’t think travel would reach pre-pandemic levels until 2024 or beyond.<br />James Sowane, who owns a transportation company catering to tourists in Fiji, called a staff meeting earlier this month and told employees to start looking for other jobs. He recently took advantage of a government-assistance program and had brought back some laid-off workers, optimistic that vaccines could spark a travel rebound as early as April.<br />But now Mr. Sowane doesn’t think tourists will return until next year, and he and his wife can’t afford to keep paying wages at their company, Pacific Destinations Fiji. He is borrowing from his bank to keep a few core employees.</td>

      <td>One of the mining industry’s most prolific dealmakers, Mick Davis has set up a new fund to invest in metals required to store power</td>
      <td>One of mining’s heavyweights is betting on batteries to power his comeback.<br />Mick Davis, a key figure in the megamergers of  BHP Ltd.  and Billiton as well as  Glencore  and Xstrata, is raising money to invest in companies that mine the metals required to store power.<br />His wager: Efforts to move to low-carbon energy will require more batteries and provide a permanent shift in metals demand.<br />Once the preserve of consumer products, batteries are disrupting the automotive and energy industries by enabling electric vehicles and making it possible to store wind and solar power. Those trends have pushed many miners to expand into the metals used to make batteries, such as lithium, cobalt, graphite and nickel.<br />The last big secular change Mr. Davis said he bet on was China in 2002, when he became chief executive of Xstrata. Driven by a belief that resources like coal, copper and zinc would be in demand as China developed, he helped transform the small Switzerland-based miner via a string of deals into a more than $50 billion giant.</td>

      <td>Every winter, Novak Djokovic has to travel some 10,000 miles to find his backyard.<br />His annual trip to Melbourne brings out crowds of adoring fans from his native Serbia. It puts him back on the zippy hard courts he loves best. And more often than not, it also comes with a major trophy. Deep into the second decade of his career, the Australian Open still feels like home.<br />Melbourne was where Djokovic won his first Grand Slam tournament in 2008 and on Sunday, it’s where he clinched the 18th of his career, cruising to a 7-5, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Daniil Medvedev of Russia in Rod Laver Arena. He now trails Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal by just two for the men’s all-time Slam record.<br />“We’re talking about some cyborgs of tennis,” Medvedev said. “In a good way.”<br />The emphatic win gave Djokovic, 33, an unparalleled ninth Australian Open title in 17 visits to the tournament that he has always called his favorite. He has never lost there in a final. Only Nadal has a more intimate relationship with a single major, winning Roland-Garros a mind-boggling 13 times.</td>

Local governments from New York to Seattle have enforced rules capping delivery-app fees, in an effort to rein in restaurants’ costs while the health crisis keeps people home.</td>

      <td>The Federal Reserve predicates its easy money policies in part on the fact that its favorite measure of inflation has run more than a half percentage point below its goal for several years.<br />With inflation so low for so long, the thinking goes, the Fed can hold interest rates very low for a while to help boost the economy as it recovers from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.<br />This raises an important question: Is the central bank thinking about inflation properly?<br />The Fed defines its inflation target in terms of consumer prices, such as those we pay for cars, toothpaste and haircuts. But in recent decades, prices have often climbed much faster for investment assets, such as homes and stocks, and twice led to booms and busts followed by recessions.<br />If the Fed does run into problems with the low interest rates it has helped to engineer, it might be because of asset prices and not consumer prices.</td>

      <td>Data may mean a second dose of the vaccine is unnecessary, potentially freeing up limited supply</td>
      <td>Covid-19 survivors who have gotten a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine are generating immune responses that might render a second shot unnecessary, potentially freeing up limited vaccine supply for more people, several new research papers suggest.<br />The research, while preliminary, found that the previously infected people generated protection against the disease quickly and at dramatically higher levels after a first shot of the current two-shot regimens when compared with people who were vaccinated but hadn’t been sick.<br />“Everyone should get vaccinated. Not everybody needs two shots,” said Viviana Simon, a professor of microbiology at New York’s Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and an author on one study. “As long as we can’t deliver as much vaccine to everybody who wants it, I think it’s an important consideration.”<br />The research, which has been posted on preprint servers but not peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal, comes as other findings into the two-shot regimen to healthy members of the general population highlight immune benefits after the first injection. On Friday, researchers in Israel reported a single shot of the vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  is 85% effective in preventing symptomatic disease 15 to 28 days after being administered.<br />Late-stage clinical trials of two-dose vaccines by Pfizer and BioNTech, as well as  Moderna Inc.,  have shown their shots to be safe and highly protective against Covid-19 when given through two doses spaced several weeks apart. However, Pfizer’s trial excluded individuals with symptomatic Covid-19, and Moderna’s left out people with a previously known infection, prompting researchers to see how immune systems in people previously sick responded.</td>

      <td>Tycoons in the region put money into U.S. blank-check companies as major local stock exchanges haven’t allowed such listings</td>
      <td>Thousands of miles from Wall Street, the boom in blank-check companies is taking hold in a region where major stock exchanges don’t let firms raise money for unspecified uses.<br />In mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore, investment firms controlled by tycoons and money managers have collectively raised billions of dollars on the New York Stock Exchange and  Nasdaq  Stock Market over the past year via special-purpose acquisition vehicles, showing how far-reaching the SPAC boom has been.<br />The vehicles are publicly listed shell companies with ready pools of cash to invest in—and merge with—private businesses. They have been touted by investment bankers as an easier way for startups to go public. If a SPAC fails to find a merger target by a deadline, typically two years, investors could take their money back.<br />As of Feb. 18, eight SPACs sponsored by companies in Asia raised a total of $2.3 billion this year, according to Dealogic data. The sum is small relative to what has been raised by American companies, but it already surpassed the total raised from SPACs in the region for all of 2020. Bankers say more issuances are likely, including from private-equity groups.<br />“This is a compelling pocket of capital that all the large private-equity and venture firms in Asia will be considering,” said Udhay Furtado, co-head of Asia equity capital markets at  Citigroup Inc.</td>
