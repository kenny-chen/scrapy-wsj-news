      <td>At 48, an HR manager shifts direction to become a professional organizer</td>
      <td>Valerie Green views her life as a series of major pivots. Some she initiated, but some she didn’t, including the latest, when she was laid off this spring.<br />Early in her working life, when she was getting started in architecture, a chance conversation with a colleague’s ex-girlfriend prompted her to leave her entry-level job at a New York firm and abandon her plan to apply to architecture school for an advanced degree. Instead, she enrolled in Stanford University’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, where she studied product design.<br />For two decades, she worked at consulting firms where she helped clients formulate new products. Her last job in the field ended with a layoff six years ago, leading her to make the leap to human resources, a field where she could put her design thinking to use in a new, less tangible way.<br />That was a successful transition. But when she was laid off from her job in learning and development this year at Sonos, a maker of wireless home speakers, she felt paralyzed. “I still had a big crush on Sonos and I was really upset,” the 48-year-old says.<br />Ms. Green made a deal with herself: She would give herself the summer to shake off the hurt before she embarked on a job search. She increased the number of hours she was volunteering at local food pantries and got a third dog. “I was upset and I wasn’t going to make a good decision,” she says. “If you can take the time to heal, that will yield better results.”</td>

Between Jan. 1 and Dec. 20, the city recorded 1,824 shooting victims, up nearly 104% from 896 during the same period a year earlier, according to NYPD data.<br />The number of shootings increased to 1,493 for the year so far, compared with 754 for the same time in 2019, the data showed. A single shooting could end up with more than one victim, which accounts for the difference in totals between victims and incidents.<br />The Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice said people of color accounted for most of the victims.<br />An analysis of NYPD data by that office showed that 1,440 of 1,495 shooting victims between Jan. 1 to Oct. 1, or 96%, were either Black or Hispanic. During that period, 29 shooting victims were white.</td>

      <td>Sen. Ted Cruz helped rework program rules, enabling Wilks brothers and others in oil industry to get relief funding</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—As the coronavirus pandemic and low oil prices walloped U.S. frackers this spring, Texas billionaires Dan and Farris Wilks got a $35 million relief loan to help one of their fracking companies stay afloat. At the same time, they were on a buying spree in the country’s oil patch.<br />Since spring, businesses controlled by the Wilks brothers have hunted for deals among fracking firms going through bankruptcy and taken or increased stakes in at least six other companies, corporate filings show. But when it looked like the oil-and-gas industry would be shut out of a key pandemic lending program, they and others in the industry turned their attention to Washington, making an appeal for help in meetings with home-state senator Ted Cruz.<br />The twin dynamics of acquisitions and government rescue show how the economic tumult caused by the pandemic has reshaped the landscape for a key U.S. industry. One result: The Wilkses have expanded their presence in a still-youthful industry where they first invested in 2002, soon to become billionaires as fracking flourished.<br />But the industry was already under pressure from international competition and a sagging oil price by the time the pandemic hit, and its mounting woes prompted the Wilkses and others to turn to allies in Washington, including Mr. Cruz. The Republican senator helped convince the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve to change the rules for pandemic loans to ensure oil and gas firms could participate.<br />Soon after the U.S. government changed the rules of its lending program in April, a Wilks family company, ProFrac Holdings LLC, applied for and received a $35 million loan, federal records show. ProFrac, a supplier of pumping equipment and services, is just one slice of the sprawling portfolio of fracking businesses that the Wilks family owns in part or outright across the American West and Canada.</td>

      <td>TOKYO—Shuichi Takatori spent two weeks in the hospital this fall with a fever after catching Covid-19. He recovered, went back to work and now feels fine.<br />But the disease lingered on in a different way—in the stigma Mr. Takatori says he felt from society. The 60-year-old member of Japan’s Parliament decided to disclose his illness, although he said he feared the consequences in next year’s election, and word quickly got around.<br />A restaurant where had dined called his office to ask for damages. The school basketball team of an aide’s child was disinvited from a tournament. And weeks after his recovery, he says relatives told him not to visit his hometown for a service on the first anniversary of his father’s death.<br />“I feel even now like it’s something embarrassing,” said Mr. Takatori, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.<br />Doctors say the shunning doesn’t make much medical sense, because people who have recovered from Covid-19 are typically no longer infectious. And public-health specialists say turning every infection into a moral failure—which is apt to be unfair, since the path of the virus is so random—can make the epidemic harder to control. For his part, Mr. Takatori said he was taking precautions and has no idea why he got sick.</td>

Each of the 100,000 winners received 200 yuan in the new digital currency, which could be spent on online or offline purchases.<br />The Suzhou pilot included twice as many residents and three times as many merchants as one conducted in October in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, the first such trial of the government-backed digital currency.<br />The trial in Suzhou also expanded the scope of the pilot program by testing the digital yuan on online stores and by introducing an electronic-payment method that doesn’t require an internet connection.<br />Wang Ju, a 39-year-old Suzhou resident who was selected to participate in the pilot, was impressed to find a pastel-colored replica of a yuan bank note featuring state founder Mao Zedong in her digital-wallet app after following the instructions.</td>

He only launched his product, called The Pinter, in September.<br />This fall, by the time infections surged again, Mr. Broadbent added another bigger warehouse to allow employees to social distance and keep safe. The company, the Greater Good Fresh Brewing Co., was able to ship ingredients to make 50,000 pints of beer in one week.<br />“That was tricky, but nowhere near as tricky as the first time,” he said.<br />The resurgence in coronavirus infections throughout the West this fall has dealt a fresh blow to the global economy. But the impact is far less, thanks in part to lessons learned by businesses, particularly in manufacturing, about how to keep workers safe and continue operating. The resurgence of East Asian economies, particularly China, has also buoyed many Western manufacturers.</td>

Brian Kemp’s signature, increases the sentence in cases where the victim was selected on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation or other bias. It also creates a hate-crimes database.<br />Legislators in South Carolina and Arkansas have looked to the Georgia law as a model able to draw broad bipartisan support in a historically conservative state.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A sweeping legislative package containing pandemic aid for businesses and families and funding for the government remained in limbo Saturday as President Trump continued to press for larger direct payments to Americans.<br />The delay could result in millions of people experiencing a suspension of unemployment benefits and a possible shutdown of the federal government on Tuesday.<br />Congress is scheduled to return early next week, although it is unclear whether lawmakers can reach a compromise that would address the president’s objections. The measure passed with enough votes to override a potential presidential veto, but it was unclear Saturday whether Mr. Trump’s opposition would persuade any Republicans to reconsider.<br />On Saturday, Mr. Trump renewed his criticism of the legislation, calling on lawmakers to increase the direct coronavirus-relief payments to $2,000 for individuals from $600 per adult and per child, the current level in the bipartisan bill. He also targeted the $1.4 trillion government funding bill that was attached to the legislation, casting it as reckless spending at a time when federal resources should be focused on the economic recovery in the U.S.<br />“I simply want to get our great people $2000, rather than the measly $600 that is now in the bill. Also, stop the billions of dollars in ‘pork,’” Mr. Trump wrote on  Twitter  on Saturday. The president hasn’t said whether he intends to veto the legislation. Earlier this week, a copy of the bill was flown to Mar-a-Lago, the private Florida club where Mr. Trump is spending the holidays, in case he decides to sign it.</td>

      <td>Spurred by the pandemic, business changes that normally might have taken years unfolded in months. Now, shifts that began as temporary fixes are likely to become permanent.</td>
      <td>For many who crossed the digital divide this year, there will be no going back.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic forced Americans to collectively swap the physical for the digital world in a matter of months. As retailers learn to operate without stores, business travelers without airplanes, and workers without offices, much of what started out as a temporary expedient is likely to become permanent.<br />“Covid has acted like a time machine: it brought 2030 to 2020,” said Loren Padelford, vice president at  Shopify Inc.  “All those trends, where organizations thought they had more time, got rapidly accelerated.”  Merchants using the company’s e-commerce platform shot up more than 20% between January and June to 1.4 million, according to broker Robert W. Baird & Co.<br />The reverberations are already apparent in everything from the stock market to corporate spending patterns to the decline of physical cash. Investors in 2020 rewarded companies with digital-intensive, asset-light business models such as online used car seller  Carvana Co. , Airbnb Inc. and  Amazon.com Inc.  or firms that supply the infrastructure that makes those models possible—like Shopify,  Zoom Video Communications Inc.  and Microsoft Corp. Businesses are now spending less on office space and travel and more on cloud computing, collaboration software and logistics.<br />In many ways, digitization is simply the next chapter of a process under way for a century: the dematerialization of the economy. As agriculture gave way to manufacturing and then services, the share of economic value derived from tangible material and muscle shrunk while the share derived from information and brains grew. Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan liked to note that economic output has steadily gotten lighter.</td>

      <td>MY FATHER was known for his daily lists. Every year on Dec. 26, he itemized the dozen tasks that would let him immediately eradicate any trace of Christmas. Not that he was a bah-humbug kind of guy, but he did not dally when there was work to do. By nightfall, the tree was at the curb, my mother’s mechanical Santas were in the attic and the breakable ornaments were safely packed away in what he called their “babble wrap” (he also was known for malapropisms).<br />My father attributed the fact that our house was always in perfect repair to his lists. As he said, “They keep me in line, Scrutt Butt.” (This was a nickname, probably a malapropism, he used interchangeably for me, my three brothers or any other dawdler he was fond of).<br />This month I resolved to make my own list of the home projects I have been avoiding, and tick them off one by one in 2021. But I ended up with 47 items on my list, and just looking at it overwhelmed me. So I played some online bridge and then I took a nap.<br />But shortly after I awoke, I heard a voice in my head, sort of like the Ghost of Post-Christmas Past, and it said, “Start by grouping similar tasks together, Scrutty. It’s not rocket science.”<br />I did that and came up with five categories of décor projects, which seemed like an improvement. And yet each seemed to represent its own circle of procrastination hell. So I sought professional help—not for the project itself but for ways to get oneself to actually tackle the job rather than goldbrick.</td>

      <td>Retired Gen. Lloyd Austin must surmount two congressional hurdles in his path to the Pentagon—a waiver, then confirmation</td>
      <td>Retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austin’s four-decade military career was defined by breakthroughs: He was the first Black general to lead a division in combat, to command a theater of war, and to lead U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan.<br />Should Gen. Austin—President-elect Joe Biden’s choice to lead the Defense Department—be confirmed, he would become the first Black secretary in Defense Department history and would be the third recently retired general ever to lead the department.<br />Because of the latter, his confirmation process will require two congressional votes. The first would be by both chambers of Congress on whether to give Gen. Austin a waiver to hold the top Pentagon civilian job even though he has been out of uniform for only four years—short of the seven years required under laws safeguarding the tradition of civilian control of the military. The second vote would be the Senate confirmation vote.<br />Gen. Austin’s career was largely built in the Middle East, while defense leaders have said the biggest challenge to the U.S. now comes from China.<br />Leading up to his confirmation hearing, senators will have a small aperture into his potential policies as defense chief. While in the military, Gen. Austin was sometimes described as the “invisible general”  because of his unwillingness to speak publicly about military campaigns he led.</td>

      <td>Restaurant selection could shrink on food delivery platforms in the new year as regulation mounts</td>
      <td>Just how valuable has restaurant selection been to delivery platforms’ growth over the past year? We could soon find out.<br />A California bill is set to require third-party delivery platforms to have stated agreements in place with merchants to deliver food orders starting Jan. 1. The bill will effectively end the growth-strategy platforms including  DoorDash  and Postmates have historically employed to rapidly augment their delivery footprints. Delivery platforms will have to remove so-called unpartnered food merchants, or those with which they don’t have a stated agreement, from their apps in California. Without an agreement, a delivery platform can list a restaurant’s menu without permission, sometimes leading to complications for restaurants like dining rooms crowded with unexpected delivery people or orders for items the kitchen no longer makes.<br />While users might be in for a shock, the companies themselves have been preparing. DoorDash, for example, said in its public-offering filing that over 95% of its gross order value came from partnered merchants in the nine months ended Sept. 30. Similarly,  Uber Technologies ’ Uber Eats said it grew active partnered restaurants by 70% year over year in the third quarter.<br />The California bill won’t affect all players equally. The impact on Postmates, whose largest market is Los Angeles, could be disproportionately large. Postmates has 700,000 merchants on its platform, according to a September regulatory filing from Uber.<br />Of those, only 115,000 were partnered at that time, according to the company.</td>

Special pandemic-related programs and extra financial assistance have assisted workers who lost jobs during the coronavirus pandemic and related shutdowns.<br />More than 22 million jobs were lost in March and April at the beginning of the pandemic. Through November, about 12 million have been recovered.<br />Here is what we know about the status of the payment programs:<br />One program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance has been available to the self-employed, gig workers and others not typically eligible for unemployment aid. The other, Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, provided up to 13 weeks of additional payments to individuals who exhausted other programs that pay benefits, such as regular state unemployment benefits.<br />Regular state programs aren’t affected. These programs, which typically run for 26 weeks, cover about 90% of U.S. workers.</td>

      <td>TOKYO—As the world’s two biggest economies, the U.S. and China send scores of startups to the public markets—some at jaw-dropping valuations—yet Japan, at No. 3, has been lagging far behind.<br />The Japanese government wants to kick its startup scene into higher gear, but it won’t be easy.<br />The country’s star initial public offering in technology this year, and one of the biggest in recent years, is online marketing-tool developer Plaid Co., whose opening trade on Dec. 18 gave it a valuation of around $1.1 billion. Meanwhile,  Airbnb Inc.  opened this month at a valuation of $102 billion, the largest in a series of blockbuster U.S. listings, while China’s JD Health International Inc. made its debut in Hong Kong at a market capitalization of roughly $38 billion, capping a bumper year for IPOs there.<br />Japan lacks the self-reinforcing mix of young innovators and financiers that has made places like Silicon Valley and Hangzhou in China, hotbeds of growth. But venture capitalists and entrepreneurs say things are improving. The amount of money startups raise in Japan has increased by more than seven times over the past seven years, to about $4.8 billion in 2019, according to Tokyo-based data tracker Initial Inc.<br />Venture funds are getting bigger, and the government is pouring in money. A unit of government-owned Japan Investment Corp., or JIC, created a $1.2 billion venture-capital fund this year, the country’s biggest. In recent weeks, it invested nearly $100 million into an initial group of seven companies.</td>

      <td>Holiday sales grew, but not by much.<br />During a remade shopping season, many Americans ditched stores for digital outlets. And pandemic buying trends that favored household goods and food over apparel continued, according to early sales data from firms that track shopper spending.<br />U.S. retail sales rose 2.4% between Nov. 1 and Christmas Eve compared with the same period last year, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks online and in-store spending with all forms of payment. Online sales grew 47.2% during that time, said the firm. The tally excludes sales of gas and autos.<br />That is below the 3.6% to 5.2% sales growth predicted by the National Retail Federation, an industry group, last month. A more complete picture of holiday spending will emerge in the coming weeks as the government reports December retail-sales figures and retailers report financial results.<br />“It’s going to be modest compared to what we have seen in the past,” said Rod Sides, head of the retail and distribution practice at consulting firm Deloitte LLP. Mr. Sides said sales are likely to rise a few percentage points, boosted by big-box and online retailers, as a surge in Covid-19 cases in recent months and new restrictions on public gatherings weighed on results. “The folks that are playing catch-up,” in retail, he said, “continued to play catch up.”</td>

      <td>To keep fit while working from home during the Covid pandemic, a data analyst in Brooklyn got on his bike—and set himself an ambitious target</td>
      <td>When a winter storm blanketed the Northeast in snow and ice this month, most outdoor exercisers shifted to an indoor workout. But Stephen Arthur, a 53-year-old IT specialist in the North Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, was 28 miles away from cycling 10,000 miles in 2020. Determined to reach his goal before year’s end, he put knobby, snow-worthy tires on his mountain bike and bundled up. Mr. Arthur didn’t have the target in mind when 2020 began, but when the pandemic hit, cycling preserved his sanity.<br />He used to bike 2 miles round trip to work. “It was an easy way to turn my commute into exercise,” he said. When he began working from home in March during lockdown, there were days when he never left his 650-square-foot apartment or spoke with anyone, except on Zoom. “Getting outdoors to bike became the highlight of my day,” he said. “I kept waiting for the governor or mayor to say you can’t ride your bike, but instead they encouraged people to get outside and exercise.”<br />Pre-pandemic, Mr. Arthur would use vacations to take multi-day, solo bike tours in different countries. Unable to travel, he now uses weekends to explore Brooklyn by bike. “I thought I knew the city,” said Mr. Arthur, who grew up in Bergen County, N.J. “Now, I’ve gotten to know it on a whole other level.”<br />When his mom died in May, cycling became an outlet for grief. Weekend rides got longer, taking him along the Hudson River or to Coney Island or to Rockaway Beach in Queens. “I probably cycled at least four centuries in September,” he said, referring to rides of 100 miles or longer.<br /></td>

      <td>Faced with a rapid deterioration in their finances in 2020, America’s colleges and universities issued a record amount of bonds this year.<br />It is a stressful time for higher education. The coronavirus pandemic worsened existing pressures on tuition and auxiliary revenue, with international students opting to study outside the U.S. and money from room and board drying up as schools keep classes online. At the same time, demand for financial aid and costs related to providing protective gear and Covid-19 testing have jumped.<br />Hoping to address possible shortfalls and take advantage of ultralow rates, universities have flooded the market with debt. With few places to get a return in the bond market, investors have scooped up the issues, which in some cases offer yields of 2% or 3% for debt that matures in 15 to 30 years.<br />The higher-education sector “becomes attractive because it’s under pressure,” said Daniel Solender, who oversees tax-free fixed-income investments at asset manager Lord Abbett & Co., referring to rising yields on higher-education bonds as schools’ ability to navigate the pandemic came into question. The firm added more than $300 million to its holdings of such bonds this year.<br />“There are a lot of high-quality institutions with great reputations, great balance sheets, that will find a way to make it through this environment,” he said.</td>

The Constitution dictates that Congress starts on Jan. 3, but in the past when the day has fallen on the weekend, lawmakers have come to an agreement to move the date to start during the workweek. But this year, Democrats wanted to start as early as possible, with the certification of Joe Biden’s election win set for Jan. 6 and Democrats wanting to avoid any recess appointments by President Trump, which could occur if there is any gap between sessions.<br />House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has been shoring up support to be able to carry a majority of those voting on the House floor when Congress comes back. Democrats have 222 seats to Republicans’ 211, with two races uncalled, making getting the 218 votes necessary tough. More than 40 lawmakers have tested positive for the coronavirus since the pandemic began, and Democrats don’t want to further dent their majority if members fall ill.<br />Mrs. Pelosi faced no opposition within her party to remain the leader. But she will need to hold most of her caucus together as she seeks approval from the full House.</td>

Now, more are introducing vehicle features that aim to make driving in rush-hour traffic or on road trips less taxing.<br />Some new systems allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel on highways or in heavy congestion, using sensors, radar and cameras to automatically keep the car centered, control speed and even to change lanes.<br />General Motors Co.  was the first major car company to promote such capabilities in 2017 with its hands-free Super Cruise feature, which can be activated on most U.S. highways by pushing a button on the steering wheel that enables the car to take over steering and speed control.</td>

We’ve tried to keep the tradition going by picking a movie for everyone to watch on their own schedule and then getting together on a video chat to talk about it. I enjoy the discussions, but why don’t I seem to like watching the movies as much anymore? —Jack<br /><br />Research has shown that when people do something together, shared emotions are amplified, making the activity feel more intense and engaging. That’s especially true if there’s an exciting or emotional component to the activity, as with an action movie. To bring back some of the experience you’re missing, try organizing a watch-party where everyone streams the movie at the same time. Knowing you’re part of a group experience, even in virtual form, can bring back some of the excitement until you can start meeting in person again.</td>

Metropolitan Nashville Police Department spokesman Don Aaron called the event “significant” and videos showed damage to businesses in the area and fires burning.<br />Local officials described a harrowing early morning scenario leading up to the blast, which took place at 6:30 a.m. Authorities said dozens of people were evacuated from hotels and other buildings. Local police officers initially responded to a 5:30 a.m. report of gunshots in the downtown area. As they arrived, they found a suspicious recreational vehicle on Second Avenue North outside the  AT&T  building. A recording coming from the vehicle said that a potential bomb would detonate within 15 minutes, Police Chief John Drake said.<br />From there, officers began an immediate evacuation of the area. Shortly after that, the vehicle exploded. Police said it was unclear if anyone was inside the RV at the time.<br />Officers “heard announcements coming from this vehicle, took them seriously, and were working to seal the streets to protect folks,” Mr. Aaron said. “We think lives were saved,” said Mr. Aaron of the rush evacuation.</td>

      <td>LONDON—Business groups are calling for more time to adjust to Britain’s new trade agreement with the European Union, saying new rules set to come into force next week risk disrupting the $590 billion-plus annual trade in goods that previously flowed freely.<br />The U.K. and EU said Thursday they had signed an agreement over their future relations, setting the seal on the 2016 British referendum decision to leave the bloc. That was a relief for businesses that feared four years of politically charged negotiations could end without a trade pact, resulting in tariffs on goods for both sides.<br />But despite the reprieve, for the first time in almost half a century, food, motor vehicles and other goods moving between the EU and U.K. will from Jan. 1 face customs checks and need to meet separate sets of standards and regulations.<br />The British government estimates there will be 215 million extra customs declarations a year, nearly 600,000 a day, which businesses say will take time and cost money to organize. Some companies will need to pay inspection fees, seek import licenses and figure out how to account for value-added tax. British food and animal exports to the EU will be checked on arrival, while some professional qualifications will no longer be automatically recognized. Some businesses say they don’t yet know fully how they will respond because they have yet to see the details of the trade agreement.<br />Predicting long lines at British and European ports, and reams of new paperwork, business groups are now calling on both the U.K. and EU to help companies navigate the changes and mitigate any new frictions to trade, including giving firms time to adjust to new rules.</td>

      <td>His aunt was the life of the party and the ruler of the roost. But her past was a set of intricate, purposeful mysteries.</td>
      <td>Haven’t we all wished for an aunt like Ferdinand Mount’s Aunt Betty? A stylish, darting little woman nicknamed Munca, she loved having her nephew spend childhood summers at her Sussex house (complete with chauffeur, nanny, cook, maid) and, in later years, ferried him up to London in her Rolls-Royce to meet theater friends at the Café de Paris. One memorable encounter in 1957, for example, was with the aging trouper Sophie Tucker. “This is my nephew,” Aunt Betty proudly declared of the mortified teenager. “He’s going to be a writer.” To which Tucker responded, “That’s swell . . . I’ve always had a lot of time for the guy with the pencil.”<br />A family photograph from the previous year says it all: Betty; her husband, Greig; their daughter, Georgie; and Ferdinand’s sister, Francie, smiling—and the young writer standing just apart unmistakably “glum and ungrateful.” For Betty was, in many ways, just too much. Whether plumping up the cushions in her chic drawing room, deadheading her rosebushes or igniting a drinks party, she seemed always to attack and overwhelm.<br />Just how much more there was to this armor-clad butterfly is revealed—incrementally and irresistibly—in “Kiss Myself Goodbye: The Many Lives of Aunt Munca,” a family history so deftly excavated and winningly conjured that it restores our faith in a literary species too often given to flabbiness and self-absorption. “It is a personal memoir that turned into a quest while I wasn’t looking,” Mr. Mount explains of his decade-long exhumation of a past riddled with as many deceptions and double-crosses as any espionage novel. “In this book, nobody’s recollections are reliable,” he cautions. And isn’t that putting it mildly.<br />All begins, as it must, with a birth. “Betty just went off to Cornwall and came back with a baby,” Ferdinand’s mother announces of her sister-in-law. Arriving in 1941, Georgie was Betty and Grieg’s golden girl and their only child until, sometime in 1950, “an adopted baby sister suddenly arrives, out of the blue, like a food parcel during the war.” Georgie and her Mount cousins adore chubby little Celeste. Then one day, she’s gone. “We just borrowed her to help her parents out,” Betty explains, and that’s that.<br />The mystery of the borrowed baby nags at Mr. Mount, as do other, seemingly related conundrums of Betty’s life: her ruthless sabotaging of Georgie’s marriage plans, the serial romances of her past, her hazy connection to her jaunty brother Buster, her real age—her real name(s), for heaven’s sake. “I had tugged the thread,” he writes of his growing curiosity, “and I could not resist following it to the end.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Trump is spending Christmas at his private Florida club and President-elect Joe Biden will remain in Delaware, the unofficial headquarters of his transition to the White House.<br />In a statement released by the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump thanked front-line medical workers, law enforcement and first responders.<br />“Your daily contributions are an example of the selfless love of God and remind us of the noble principles we strive to live by, especially during this special time of year,” he said.<br />Later, the president said on Twitter he would give brief remarks to U.S. service members across the world via videoconference, with “Fake News not invited!”<br />Mr. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday night after vetoing a $740.5 billion defense-policy bill and demanding that lawmakers revise a coronavirus-aid package that funds the federal government. The president issued a string of pardons, including of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, longtime adviser Roger Stone, and Charles Kushner, his son-in-law’s father. He is expected to remain at Mar-a-Lago until the New Year.</td>

      <td>The Congressional Review Act could swiftly undo Trump successes.</td>
      <td>If Democrats control the Senate next month after Georgia’s runoffs, say a quick goodbye to President Trump’s recent deregulation. With full control of Washington, Democrats could use the Congressional Review Act to annul the Trump Administration’s handiwork, as Republicans undid Barack Obama’s. The good news: More of Mr. Trump’s efforts are now safe from the CRA, thanks to the wrangling over virus relief.<br />The CRA lets lawmakers nix regulations published in the previous 60 legislative days, with a similar “lookback” period for a new Congress. That review window moves: Whenever lawmakers dither in D.C., the CRA review period for their successors gets later on the calendar. Judging by Congress’s schedules, analysts thought new rules from the Trump Administration might be at risk beginning as early as May.<br />That would put in jeopardy some big items on Mr. Trump’s agenda. This summer the Administration finished overhauling environmental reviews, the goal being to prevent endless projects like Denver’s 13-year study of a 12-mile road expansion. That deregulation will be crucial for the success of any big infrastructure bill. But the new rule wasn’t finished until July 16, and at the time it seemed within the CRA’s window.<br />Legislative dysfunction to the rescue: Congress later added days to its session as it worked toward a scrupulous agreement—that’s a joke—on this week’s 5,593-page omnibus to fund the government, provide Covid relief, create new Smithsonian museums, and Make Business Lunches Great Again. Now the CRA’s review period in 2021 might not reach back further than August, although the precise window won’t be clear until lawmakers deal with Mr. Trump’s veto threat.<br />Plenty is still at risk, including the new rules the Trump Administration might finish before the inaugural oath is delivered on Jan. 20. The Labor Department recently adopted a rule saying retirement-plan fiduciaries must pick investments “solely on financial considerations,” meaning no settling for lower returns in exchange for fewer carbon emissions.</td>

      <td>Political clemency will inevitably follow political prosecutions.</td>
      <td>President Trump’s flurry of pardons and grants of clemency this week are being denounced far and wide, and many of them appear to be undeserved, or worse. But the critics would have more credibility if they tried to understand why tens of millions of Americans will discount these as the Andrew Weissmann pardons.<br />Mr. Weissmann is the former deputy to special counsel Robert Mueller on the Russia collusion probe. He’s a Democratic partisan who can be seen even now on MSNBC suggesting that Mr. Trump obstructed justice in the probe that never turned up evidence of collusion. He and his fellow prosecutors spent two years, with the full resources of the federal government, trying to prove a case that didn’t exist.<br />Instead they indicted individuals in the Trump orbit of crimes unrelated to their main purpose. They pursued Paul Manafort on a foreign-lobbying statute that is rarely enforced and then turned up evidence of tax fraud. They coerced George Papadopoulos and Alex van der Zwaan into copping pleas on a single count of making false statements. Roger Stone was convicted of obstructing a Congressional investigation.<br />Mr, Manafort’s tax offenses are serious crimes, and that’s how a jury saw them. He and Mr. Stone, former business partners, have long been political scoundrels of the type Mr. Trump likes to have around him. But there’s no doubt they were targeted not for their specific offenses but because they associated with Mr. Trump. Prosecutors were out to get Mr. Trump—many of them still are—and they were happy to take down others in the hope they would have evidence against the President.<br />Yet the targeted men had nothing to offer beyond what prosecutors turned up from other sources. It was inevitable that Mr. Trump would pardon these former associates before he left office. If the good and righteous want to avoid political pardons, they should be more critical of political prosecutions.</td>

The 5,593-page year-end package passed both chambers of Congress with broad bipartisan support, and the president only publicly registered his frustrations after lawmakers approved the legislation.<br />The president called on lawmakers to increase the direct payments to $2,000 for individuals from $600 per adult and per child, the current level in the bipartisan bill. He also criticized the spending portion of legislation, which includes routine funding for foreign allies and international programs.<br />“Why would politicians not want to give people $2000, rather than only $600? It wasn’t their fault, it was China,” the president wrote on Twitter on Friday. “Give our people the money!”<br />The president delegated negotiations to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and played little role in the monthslong talks over the bill. He hasn’t told lawmakers whether he intends to veto it, furthering the uncertainty about the fate of the package.</td>

      <td>The musician behind many chart-topping classics calls himself ‘a master of nothing who could do a few things at once</td>
      <td>Michael McDonald is one of the most recognizable voices of his generation. He wrote and sang songs that have topped the airwaves for decades, including “Takin’ It to the Streets,” “What a Fool Believes” and “Minute by Minute” with his Doobie Brothers bandmates, as well as “I Keep Forgettin’” as a solo artist. But to hear Mr. McDonald tell it, he was something of an accidental superstar, “a master of nothing who could do a few things at once: play some piano, write some songs, sing background.”<br />He was recently inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Doobie Brothers. The ceremony, originally planned for May 2020, was postponed and then turned into an HBO special—one pandemic adjustment that he says he didn’t much mind. “I love getting awards and am honored to do so, but I’m socially inept at these events,” he says with a laugh. “The last time I went to the Grammys, I was the only one in a tuxedo, so I was actually relieved that we didn’t have to go through the whole thing. It fits my personality to stay home and watch it on television.”<br />Mr. McDonald, 68, had a modest attitude when the Doobie Brothers brought him aboard in 1975 as a temporary substitute for their ailing frontman Tom Johnston, and little seems to have changed since. “I look back on my career and realize that blind ignorance allowed me to succeed,” he says over the phone from his Santa Barbara, Calif., home. “I kind of overanalyze things, and if that’s self-deprecation, so be it. I call it being a little more in touch with reality. I look back on my music and feel so blessed that people like it. But do I think it’s the greatest stuff I’ve ever heard? No. That’s just the reality.”<br />As a child in Ferguson, Mo., Mr. McDonald played banjo to accompany his father, who used to sing Tin Pan Alley and ragtime songs, before moving on to keyboards and Top 40 cover bands. He later mastered Motown tunes, which deepened his love of R&B.<br />In 1970, an 18-year-old Mr. McDonald moved to Los Angeles. He recorded demos for RCA Records while working as a keyboardist and background vocalist on recordings with members of the legendary “Wrecking Crew” band of superb session musicians, who graced thousands of songs by all sorts of artists. The experience “was transformative,” Mr. McDonald says. “I learned studio skills from some of the greatest ever to do it.”</td>

      <td>The pandemic offers a unique opportunity to fix the housing crisis plaguing rural America.</td>
      <td>With the Covid-19 pandemic has come the rise of remote work, and rural America is having a moment. Searches on RedFin and Zillow show upticks in interest in rural areas, as more Americans determine to flee the cities for greener pastures.<br />Finding a house in rural America, however, may be easier said than done. Consider Orange County, Ind.—population 19,840 in 2010—which is in many ways a model for rural America. It has a thriving arts community, a local food co-op and a farmers’ market, interesting ecological and natural features such as the Rise at Orangeville natural spring and Hoosier National Forest, and a rich history, with a name deriving from the Dutch Protestant House of Orange.<br />And it has wide open spaces—too wide open. There simply isn’t enough housing for the people who want to live there. This counterintuitive housing shortage is having a devastating effect on rural America’s economy.<br />At first glance, Orange County’s housing shortage doesn’t make sense. One would think building in rural America would be easy. There is plenty of cheap land; zoning rules are generally less restrictive; and employers are struggling to fill job openings. Yet the housing crunch is an enormous struggle. In 2017 there were a mere 79,000 single-family home starts in all of “nonmetropolitan” America, compared with 223,800 in 2005.<br />One explanation is the unwillingness of banks to extend loans to contractors or developers looking to build housing where there are no comparison properties nearby. And given the relatively small, sometimes stagnant housing markets in rural areas, there are often few such “comps.” Without them, there can be no loans. Without loans, there can be no building.</td>

      <td>Behind the paradox lies a superstition about history that may explain their viciousness and violence.</td>
      <td>It is impossible to read Mark Twain in the 21st century without being aware, each time one encounters it, of the single most unspeakable word in the English language today; a word that in Twain’s time was as common as mud and therefore completely unremarkable on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line. The issue concerning the appropriateness of designating “Huckleberry Finn” and “Tom Sawyer” in their original and unexpurgated state as assigned reading in English classes in the public schools has troubled teachers and administrators since at least the 1990s.<br />I am not concerned here with the question of whether the bowdlerization of these texts is defensible, a moral imperative, or an offense against literature—New South published a sanitized edition of the two books in 2011—but rather with the paradoxical character of postmodern political correctness. That character was exposed, also in 2011, when the Virginia Department of Education adopted a textbook, “Our Virginia: Past and Present” by Joy Masoff, which contained the claim that “thousands of Southern blacks fought in the Confederate ranks, including two under the command of Stonewall Jackson.” That prompted anger and indignation on the left and an advisory to teachers from the department to ignore the passage.<br />Yet it is a historically confirmed fact that many Southern blacks, freemen as well as slaves, fought on the side of the Confederacy, as attested to by the historian William Freehling and documented by Harvard’s Prof. John Stauffer in an essay for TheRoot.com. Even so, many Civil War historians continue to deny it for ideological reasons.<br />The dispute over the existence of black Confederate soldiers is a clear instance of how radical progressives, in their war on America, have been pursuing two contradictory aims at once. First, they have worked tirelessly to expose what they view as the fundamentally and indelibly racist character of America from its inception. Thus the central purpose of the “1619 Project,” conceived by Nikole Hannah-Jones and subsequently developed by the  New York Times  magazine: to rewrite, edit and otherwise “correct” the history of the American Republic. Second, they have sought to sanitize America’s cultural achievements and thereby satisfy the moral demands of the present time, all for the good of future generations.<br />No one has noticed, or at any rate pointed out, the basic contradictoriness of exposing, emphasizing, and displaying our national sins on the one hand, while on the other trying to obliterate every trace of them from historical record.</td>

      <td>An ill-conceived bid to turn Massachusetts foster parents into salaried government employees.</td>
      <td>Service Employees International Union Local 509 launched an effort in October to organize Massachusetts foster parents, claiming that it would “amplify foster parent voices in order to make meaningful repairs to our broken system.” In reality, unionizing foster parents would turn them into salaried government employees, creating a conflict of interest for Local 509. The union represents child welfare agency caseworkers, who are frequently the target of complaints from foster parents.<br />“I always hated the idea that kids don’t have a safe place to be,” says Rachel, a single woman who lives in a Boston suburb (names have been changed to protect the privacy of foster children and to protect foster parents from retaliation). She has wanted to be a foster parent since she was a teenager. She told the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families that she would happily take in an older child—something not enough foster families are willing to do—but that she couldn’t manage a child with severe behavioral problems. Rachel had volunteered for years with special-needs kids but knew that, as a single parent, she could only handle so much.<br />DCF didn’t listen. When 12-year-old Alexa (also an alias) showed up at the door, she had been in other foster homes for almost a year, including a stint with her grandmother that ended because of Alexa’s violent temper. She had thrown chairs at school and threatened kids at camp. Because of her history, no family members were willing to take her in. But no one told Rachel. Instead, only a single box was checked off on the form listing Alexa’s challenges—hygiene. It’s true that in the months that Alexa lived in Rachel’s home she smeared feces on the wall, but that was one of the less frightening incidents. Rachel finally told DCF after 10 months that she couldn’t handle Alexa anymore.<br />“Either they were negligent or deliberately held back information from me,” Rachel says. “They just said whatever they had to in order to get her into my home.”<br />Rachel’s experience with DCF is the tip of the iceberg. A devastating 2019 exposé in the Boston Globe revealed that “2,000 families have stopped accepting foster children in the past five years—almost as many as the total number of foster families currently in the system.” The department never asked these parents why they quit. When the Globe did, they uncovered stories of parents who were never told about kids’ medical problems, behavioral issues or past-traumatic experiences.</td>

      <td>The original cover art for ‘The Blue Lotus,’ an artistic breakthrough for the cartoonist Hergé, will be auctioned in Paris next month.</td>
      <td>‘It’s too good for children!” exclaimed Georges Remi about “The Blue Lotus,” the fifth in his series of comic books about the intrepid boy reporter Tintin. Remi—better known to readers by his pen name Hergé—created the character in 1929 for a Belgian newspaper, but it was the books that made Tintin world-famous: 23 were published before the cartoonist’s death in 1983. When “The Blue Lotus” appeared in 1936, Hergé was 29 years old and approaching the peak of his powers as an artist. “In terms of quality there is a before and after ‘The Blue Lotus,’” says Eric Leroy, comic strip expert for the Artcurial auction house in Paris.<br />On Jan. 14, Artcurial will auction the original cover art for “The Blue Lotus,” in Indian ink, watercolor and gouache on paper. It shows Tintin and his dog Snowy poking their heads out of a Ming vase to confront a giant trompe-l’oeil dragon painted on the wall behind them; both parties look surprised by the encounter. The presale high estimate for the cover art is $3.4 million, just below Hergé’s auction record of $3.6 million, set in 2014.<br />Like his creator, Tintin is a French-speaking Belgian, but his adventures take him all over the world, and readers were drawn by Hergé’s carefully researched renderings of exotic locales. The first books in the series took Tintin and his faithful companions on eventful missions to the U.S.S.R., the Belgian Congo, Egypt and the U.S. In “The Blue Lotus” he travels to China, where he witnesses Japanese imperialism and risks his life to break up an international opium-smuggling ring.<br />The cover art at auction next month is unique. When Hergé submitted it to his publisher Louis Casterman, the art was deemed too costly to reproduce using the standard four-color printing method. Hergé came up with a simpler version for use in the book but gave the original to Casterman’s young son, who folded it in six and stored it in a drawer. His heirs have now decided to sell the drawing. “I’d say it’s the most beautiful artwork by Hergé on the market that remains in private hands,” says Mr. Leroy.<br />One of Hergé’s inspirations for the drawing was a magazine cover that showed the actress Anna May Wong, star of the 1932 film “Shanghai Express,” posing against a red dragon backdrop. Michael Farr reproduced the image in his 2001 book “Tintin: The Complete Companion,” which traces the real-life sources of Tintin’s adventures. Mr. Farr, who met Hergé in 1978, describes him as a “journalist manqué”: “That’s why he created Tintin, who was the dashing foreign correspondent he aspired to be.”</td>

You know, the house we lived in when we were still married.”<br />In the scripted drama, produced by Qcode Media, Ms. Moore plays an accountant who secretly runs a website that streams audio of women sharing their intimate desires. The original plan was to record the show with a cast on a sound stage, but when the pandemic hit, the production went online and the actors interacted with each other remotely over Zoom, from makeshift studios in closets and spare rooms at home.<br />“I went to different rooms and recorded myself and said, hey, which one sounds the best?” Ms. Moore said in a recent Zoom call. “It ended up being my bathroom.”<br />A-list celebrities like Matthew McConaughey, Kristen Wiig, Rami Malek and Cynthia Erivo are turning to scripted fiction podcasts with the production qualities of TV and film—just without the pictures. Alongside film, TV and theater, scripted podcasts have become a popular, somewhat pandemic-proof medium for actors and writers to tell ambitious stories.</td>

Mexico began administering 3,000 doses from Pfizer, and Argentina will start inoculations next week after 300,000 doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine arrived Thursday from Moscow on an Argentine state aircraft.<br />The first injections in Mexico and Chile were broadcast live on television.<br />“It was something unexpected, I’m very excited,” said Zulema Riquelme, a 46-year-old Chilean nurse who works with Covid-19 patients and became the first in that country to receive the vaccine. “These have been difficult months because I haven’t been able to see my family, a lot of exhaustion. I feel proud that they chose me.”<br />The arrival of the vaccines, which most countries are administering first to front-line health-care workers before giving them to the elderly, offers a glimmer of hope for a region of 650 million that has logged over 470,000 deaths from Covid-19, about 30% of the world’s total, and more than 14 million cases. With a new surge of deaths and cases now hammering the region, health officials in most countries are still negotiating purchases with pharmaceutical companies or awaiting delivery of vaccines early next year.</td>

That is happening as the U.K. copes with a fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus that has forced lockdowns over most of the country.<br />On Christmas Day, ambassadors from the 27 EU countries met in Brussels to begin scrutinizing the agreement, ahead of its expected approval by governments next week. The British Parliament is set to meet on Dec. 30 to ratify the accord.<br />It will take effect with the U.K. and economies across the world already straining under the pandemic and governments’ efforts to contain it. The U.K. has been among the worst-hit economies, with gross domestic product at the end of the third quarter almost 10% less than it was a year earlier.<br />Britain will have to adjust to the new relationship with the EU as it simultaneously deals with the economic pain caused by the virus. That risks hindering a recovery, economists and business executives say, with unpredictable consequences for jobs and livelihoods as businesses adapt to the upheavals of both challenges.</td>

That figure was an improvement: 16 firms met targets the year before, and 11 the year before that.<br />Buildings generate a surprisingly large share of the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. About 40% of annual emissions in the U.S. come from heating, lighting, cooling and constructing buildings, according to the AIA.<br />The architects learned a lesson when trying to meet their green challenge, one that applies broadly to industrywide efforts to address climate change: Customers have to want the products first.<br />“The architecture profession tends to give what the client asks for and the vast majority of clients aren’t asking” for green structures, said Mike Fowler, a senior associate at Mithun Inc., a Seattle-based architecture firm that was among the few to hit the mark. Mithun always presents at least one energy-efficient design option to clients and works to educate them on climate benefits and potential cost savings, he said.</td>

But sovereignty isn’t the same as equality and in international affairs, other nations’ objectives must be taken into account.<br />And in international affairs, power matters, as the just-concluded pact between the U.K. and the EU shows. The EU is a much more important market to the U.K., accounting for some 43% of its exports, than the U.K. is to the EU as a whole or to any individual EU country.<br />That asymmetry meant the EU could extract a price from the U.K. for tariff-free access to the bloc that it didn’t demand of Canada and Japan—less important potential competitors than the U.K.—in past free-trade deals. That price was a U.K. agreement not to undercut EU standards in areas like labor, the environment and subsidies to the private sector.</td>

      <td>Max Weber’s ‘Athletic Contest’ features a mix of new ideas, formal experiments and theories then current in advanced art.</td>
      <td>Well into the 1960sMax Weber (1881-1961) was the most famous early modernist in America. Since then, Marsden Hartley, Georgia O’Keeffe and Arthur Dove have been accorded top places in our history. However, from 1909 to 1919, he produced some of the greatest paintings ever made in this country. There is now a fine Weber on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the remarkable “Athletic Contest.”<br /><br />Initially titled “Interscholastic Runners,” it was painted in 1915 when Weber was at the peak of his powers. The painting is a challenging compendium of the new ideas, formal experiments and theories then current in advanced art, made personal and distinctly American. The work serves as a virtual laboratory of artistic pragmatism in which Weber, like so many other American artists, took only what he needed from European art. Weber’s Cubism of the 1910s incorporated his interest in other contemporary art movements and philosophies. Equally contemporary, his subjects were drawn from New York’s fast-paced, complex life.<br />In “Athletic Contest” he cast cyclists, runners, spectators and a pole vaulter as flattened forms jostling on overlapping planes, reflecting his interest in the simultaneity of time and place, fusing memories and experiences. The painting swirls with nonstop energy, catching the unceasing activity of life and reflecting Weber’s keen awareness of Italian Futurism. Weber was also drawing upon the influential writings of Henri Bergson (1859-1941), who rejected the Impressionist emphasis on the single moment in time and considered time as a fluid continuity—la durée—that fused past, present and future.<br />Weber once said of his work, “I painted motion.” Here he deployed dynamic, Futurist “force lines” to convey speed and a repetition of forms to suggest sequential motion, inspired by the photographic studies of Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey, well known to Futurists and many other artists at this time, as well as Marcel Duchamp’s radical “Nude Descending a Staircase.” Prime examples of this technique are the runner portrayed by a line of four heads at the top of Weber’s painting and the motion of the pole vaulter at the center. Here and in other works, there are clear references to cinematic movement. Over time, Futurism was as great an influence as Cubism on Weber’s work of this period.</td>

Many models from Japan’s top car makers—Toyota,  Honda Motor Co.  and  Nissan Motor Co. —come in both traditional and hybrid versions.<br />Earlier this month, Toyota President Akio Toyoda said that if Japan was too hasty in banning gasoline-powered cars and moving to electric vehicles, “the current business model of the car industry is going to collapse.” He was speaking on behalf of Japanese car makers in his role as head of a local industry association.<br />Mr. Toyoda said the electricity grid couldn’t handle extra summer demand and observed that most of Japan’s electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels.</td>

They usually are somewhat lower than those of Treasurys due to their tax advantages.<br />The dislocation didn’t last long, but assuming that things are back to normal in the $4 trillion market would be a mistake. There were two reasons for the big divergence: Investors rushed to own Uncle Sam’s liabilities—the safest, most-liquid securities in the world—to the exclusion of nearly everything else. But they also fretted that the collapse in commerce, travel and employment would crush state and local revenue.<br />“We have no money,” said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in a March radio interview at the height of this spring’s emergency.<br />New York’s situation now looks less dire, but the damage to it and other issuers is substantial. State tax collections nationwide were 6.4% lower between March and August against expected growth of 2% to 3%, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Cities were even worse off with an average 21% revenue drop since the pandemic began, according to a survey released this month by the National League of Cities. Meanwhile, the pandemic brought unexpected expenses.<br />The degree to which state and local coffers were hurt depended largely on how they raise money. Jurisdictions that rely largely on income taxes took a hit and those relying on tourist spending did even worse. Cities that fund themselves mostly on property taxes could be in fairly good shape as long as they aren’t dependent on struggling malls and office buildings.</td>

      <td>LAWYERS HELPING TRUMP with his quixotic election challenges are finding little support from their firms or their university affiliations, which don’t want their brands associated with the campaign. Chapman University became the latest organization to formally distance itself from a Trump legal effort after it ordered faculty member John Eastman to stop using a Chapman email, phone number and physical address in his court filings on behalf of Trump before the Supreme Court. A recent court filing by the Trump campaign shows that Eastman has since changed his listed address to a UPS store in Anaheim, Calif.<br />Eastman’s ties to Chapman “should not be construed as implying any concurrence or approval for his actions by the university,” said Chapman University President Daniele C. Struppa. In a lengthy response to Chapman, Eastman said law faculty frequently use the university’s address on court filings, and he accused the university of having a double standard toward Trump supporters. Law firms like Porter Wright Morris & Arthur LLP and Jones Day have also distanced themselves from Trump’s efforts to overturn the election, moves that were criticized by the Trump campaign as buckling to “leftist mobs.”<br />In recent days, Trump’s White House lawyers have pushed back on lawyer Sidney Powell’s efforts to have a special counsel appointed to review the election results. And that’s after Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said last month that Powell wasn’t a part of their legal team after she suggested that long-deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez was behind alleged election rigging.<br />AFTER TARGETED RESTAURANT AID was left out of the coronavirus relief package, its primary backers had harsh words about who deserved the blame. For Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer, who sponsored a House effort to make nonchain restaurants eligible for direct grants, some responsibility lies with the powerful National Restaurant Association. A Senate version, backed by the NRA, was designed for a broader set of restaurants and would permit restaurants that are part of a chain to receive aid.<br />“They didn’t lift a finger. They spent no political capital,” Blumenauer told the Journal. “They were there to claim credit, they weren’t there to help.” The NRA said it called for a comprehensive restaurant-recovery effort from Congress within days of the industry being shut down in March, and this has continued to be its top ask. “We are proud of our advocacy efforts for the entire restaurant industry,” said Sean Kennedy, the association’s executive vice president for public affairs.</td>

But he later soured on Castro and was granted political asylum in the U.S.<br />Like so many people who have escaped political oppression, Mr. Cruz has a special appreciation for America and its freedoms. So why did his son recently block legislation on the Senate floor to open America’s door to people like his father—Hong Kongers now enduring a crackdown by another Communist government?<br />The legislation is “The Hong Kong People’s Freedom and Choice Act of 2020,” and it passed the House in early December by voice vote. The bill would make it easier for Hong Kongers to gain refugee or temporary protected status. TPS allows people from designated countries to remain and work in the United Status.<br />Mr. Cruz, who has supported Hong Kong’s democracy movement in the past, offers two main objections. First, he says the bill isn’t really about helping Hong Kong; it’s another Democratic effort to relax standards on behalf of “open borders.” Second, he says it would give China an opening to infiltrate spies into the U.S.<br />He prefers his own bill to cut off federal funding for Hollywood filmmakers who censor their films for screening in China. He is also pushing the Shame Act, which would sanction China for forced sterilizations and abortions directed at religious minorities such as the Muslim Uighurs.</td>

      <td>The University of Texas at Austin will dissolve its bias-response team.</td>
      <td>Political speech is under attack these days from Beijing to Berkeley, so we’ll take victories where we can get them. One arrived Tuesday when the University of Texas at Austin agreed to disband its PC police and end policies that suppress speech on campus.<br />Credit the nonprofit Speech First, which sued on behalf of student members in 2018. The group claimed UT and its officials had “created an elaborate investigatory and disciplinary apparatus to suppress, punish, and deter speech that other students deem ‘offensive,’ ‘biased,’ ‘uncivil,’ or ‘rude.’”<br />Students could anonymously report their professors and peers for “bias incidents” to the Campus Climate Response Team, which would investigate and threaten disciplinary referrals and “restorative justice” meetings with administrators. The university gave several examples of what constitutes an act of bias, including “faculty commentary in the classroom perceived as derogatory and insensitive,” and other behavior open to highly subjective judgments about what is offensive.<br />A federal judge dismissed the case in 2019. Citing that decision, university spokesman J.B. Bird said Wednesday that there was “no evidence students were disciplined, sanctioned or investigated for their speech” and that, “to the contrary,” there was “strong evidence of the university protecting the speech rights of conservative students and guests on campus.”<br />But Speech First appealed, and in October the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the ruling and remanded the case back to the district court. Circuit Court Judge Edith Jones blasted the bias-response team as “the clenched fist in the velvet glove of student speech regulation.”</td>

It seems to me impossible that there are not people walking along the streets in the U.S. who have it, don’t know it and are spreading it.” We thought what was coming would decide the 2020 election.

      <td>WASHINGTON—Republicans blocked Democrats’ effort to pass legislation approving $2,000 stimulus checks for Americans by unanimous consent in the U.S. House, and countered with an attempt to cut foreign aid that was thwarted by Democrats in turn.<br />House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) made the request for Democrats. Rep. Rob Wittman (R., Va.) made Republicans’ request. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D., Mich.), presiding over the rare Christmas Eve session, said neither proposal had been “cleared by bipartisan floor and committee leadership” and therefore couldn't be “entertained”—confirming that leadership on each side of the aisle had objected to the other party’s proposed legislation.<br />The largely symbolic moves Thursday came in response to President Trump’s demand that lawmakers increase direct payments to Americans as part of massive legislation that combines a coronavirus relief package with a $1.4 trillion government funding bill. Mr. Trump called on lawmakers to increase the direct payments to $2,000 for individuals from $600 per adult and per child, the current level in the bipartisan bill. Congress overwhelmingly approved the legislation earlier this week, and Mr. Trump only publicly voiced his concerns after it passed.<br />In addition to complaining that the checks were too skimpy, Mr. Trump had criticized the spending portion of the 5,593-page year-end package, which includes routine funding for foreign allies and international programs. The foreign aid was in Mr. Trump’s budget and had been approved by the Republican-controlled Senate Appropriations Committee and by the majority of House Republicans as recently as Monday.<br />In a letter to his GOP colleagues on Wednesday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) of trying to “use the American people as leverage to make coronavirus relief contingent on government funding—which includes billions of foreign aid at a time when there are urgent needs at home.”</td>

But the price action was minimal and mirrored a similar drop earlier this week, when investors shrugged off new stimulus measures as Congress passed a $900 billion Covid-19 aid bill that includes direct payments to households, aid to businesses and more. The fate of that package is now unclear following criticism from President Trump.<br />Government-bond yields have largely been stuck in a range, pinned by the Federal Reserve’s efforts to stimulate the economy and investor uncertainty around when a vaccine-fueled rebound will take place.</td>

      <td>WITH DESIGN museums and historic homes off-limits, these streaming series, premiering or returning in the next month, are a satisfying substitute for décor junkies.<br />This lavish new series from executive producer Shonda Rhimes follows the cream of British society as they traverse the ballrooms and gardens of 1815 London. Diverse casting and a tweak to Regency style bring this drawing-room drama into the 21st century. “It was all about creating a clean, fresh, colorful world modern audiences could relate to,” said production designer Will Hughes-Jones. For the old-money Bridgerton family, that meant a refined palette of blue, white and champagne, inspired by then-newly popular Wedgwood china. The bedroom in the upstart Featheringtons’ home, by comparison, illustrates their new-money flash: a gilt-frame mirror, damask on nearly every surface and the acid yellows and bright pinks favored by the family, part of a “heightened reimagining of the period.”<br />Most of the first season of this delightfully oddball show, which introduced poet Emily Dickinson (Hailee Steinfeld) as an angsty, goofy teen, took place in her parents’ staid 1850s New England home. This season shifts to the new estate of Emily’s brother Austin (Adrian Enscoe) and his wife, Sue (Ella Hunt). “It’s more of a Victorian Italianate villa, and it’s much more showy,” said production designer Neil Patel. Reflecting Sue’s aspirations, the parlor is decorated in regal blues, greens and golds, with a mix of Hudson River School and Old World art hung salon-style and a showstopping reclining sofa. Said Mr. Patel, “The design looks toward the most current European styles of the time.”<br />In this post-apocalyptic series with a bonkers premise—passengers are stuck in a train hurtling endlessly across the globe’s frozen dystopia—all the action takes place within 14-by-40-foot railcars comprising a slew of styles and periods. This first class apartment car (pictured), home to homicide detective Andre Layton (Daveed Diggs), was previously inhabited by an aging international architect, said production designer Stephen Geaghan. “His best days were the ’50s and ’60s, when he made his money.” Hence the homage to mid-20th-century design: Marcel Breuer Wassily chairs, sculptural circular fireplace and shagalicious carpet.</td>

      <td>The last-minute trade deal opens new doors for the U.K., EU and U.S.</td>
      <td>Brexit came down to the wire but it arrived Thursday, with a new trade deal between the United Kingdom and European Union. Arguments about whether this is a good or bad deal for either side matter less than the fact that British voters have finally received what they voted for in 2016.<br />Britain left the European Union on Jan. 31 and has been in a transitional period applying most EU economic regulations. The new deal governs trading rules when the transition ends on Dec. 31. The agreement provides for zero-tariff, zero-quota trade in goods and allows trade in some services to continue with minimal restriction. The U.K. regains the ability to set its own labor, environment and other regulations, although the EU could reapply tariffs if Brussels believes trade with the U.K. becomes “unfair.”<br />Trade won’t be as free as it was when the U.K. was in the EU, and more red tape is inevitable. The deal also doesn’t cover financial services. Because it leaves scope for greater divergence between the two sides, the deal is nearer to a so-called hard Brexit than many British and European politicians expected. But by the standards of other trade deals around the world, the new pact is relatively open.<br />The deal will prove its merit by what each side does with the new opportunities it presents. The U.K. has sacrificed seamless access to the European market as the price of regaining the regulatory freedom to unshackle its domestic economy and strike new trade deals with other nations.<br />Now London should follow through. Prime Minister Boris Johnson seems disinclined to push too hard for deregulation at home, but his Brexit deal will be a costly missed opportunity if he doesn’t. A trade deal with the U.S. would be the biggest prize, and one is possible if Britain is prepared to reform food-safety regulations and liberalize pharmaceutical procurement, among other things.</td>

It was a long and winding road but we have got a good deal to show for it. It is fair. It is a balanced deal and it is the right and responsible thing to do for both sides,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a press conference after the deal was announced. “The European Union and the United Kingdom will stand shoulder to shoulder to deliver on our common goals.”<br />Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the accord ends the uncertainty that has bedeviled U.K. politics for years and puts its economy on a better footing to recover from the pandemic. “This deal above all means certainty,” he said.<br />Germany and France welcomed the deal, a sign that the EU’s two largest economies are likely to support it when leaders formally sign off on the agreement next week.</td>

      <td>Christmas came early to my town this year. Even before the children made their socially distanced way from house to house for trick-or-treating, the storefronts and houses of Berwyn, Pa., were decorated in long coils of Christmas lights. On our local online discussion board, one woman said that she wished everyone could have just waited until after Thanksgiving and the beginning of Advent. Seasonal decorations, after all, are properly reserved for the season.<br />You can imagine the response she received. Incredulous to the point of anger, other neighbors announced that after a lousy year which sometimes felt like an unending darkness, it was a great relief to drive around and see the lights sparkling. At least one could enjoy the lights even if the businesses themselves were shuttered! They had a point: For many of us, Christmas isn’t about commemorating a specific event, the birth of Jesus, at a particular time. Rather, it is a whole season of sentiment. Avalanches of greeting cards, unexpected warm smiles from passersby, the ringing of bells, the singing of carols, a childlike awe at lights in the darkness—all serve to induce a sensation of good cheer.<br />What should Christians make of such simple pleasures and delights? Are they innocent distractions, obstacles to faith—or perhaps something more profound than we give them credit for?<br />Frank Capra’s 1946 film “It’s a Wonderful Life” has become a Christmas classic in part because it so beautifully captures the sentimental spirit of Christmas. In nearly every scene, Capra plays on our sympathies, tugging the heartstrings at the puppy love between George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) and Mary Hatch (Donna Reed); at the villainy of Mr. Potter, the greedy banker (Lionel Barrymore); at the delicate affection of George’s daughter Zuzu for the flower she has won at school.<br />The most obviously sentimental appeal comes from Clarence the angel (Henry Travers). Near the end of the film, George, threatened with bankruptcy and jail because his alcoholic uncle has mislaid the firm’s cash, despairs of what he has made of his life and attempts suicide on Christmas Eve. He is rescued by the inept but loving Clarence, who has been sent to teach him the true value of his life.</td>

      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />Thirty years ago this month, the American Dialect Society began an annual tradition of selecting a Word of the Year. What began as a whimsical exercise on the model of Time’s Person of the Year has grown in stature as dictionary publishers and other groups have followed suit.<br />For a decade now, I have been overseeing the dialect society’s Word of the Year selection as chair of the its New Words Committee. For this year, more than 300 attendees took part in a virtual event last week featuring a lively debate over nominations in a variety of categories.<br />There was no shortage of innovative terms, including some previously featured in this column, like “doomscrolling” (obsessing over bad news online, chosen as Digital Word of the Year) and “the Before Times” (a term for the pre-pandemic era, deemed Most Useful). Other prime 2020 words included “oysgezoomt,” a Yiddishism meaning “fatigued by overexposure to Zoom,” and “Blursday,” to describe the experience of days seeming to blend into each other during lockdown.<br />But the overall winner of Word of the Year, after much deliberation, was a more obvious word with which we’ve become all too familiar: “Covid.” It’s hard even to think back to the beginning of 2020—aka the Before Times—when those five letters carried no meaning. The closest you might have gotten to it was “corvid,” known to bird lovers as a term covering crows, jays, magpies and ravens.</td>

      <td>Seeking an ocean passage to China, William Barents set the template for polar adventure and endurance.</td>
      <td>The cold, hoary legacy of polar exploration depends on outsize characters—and good books. Some chronicle legendary survivors. Ernest Shackleton found fame in 1917 by bringing his crew safely back from Antarctica, yielding one of the best adventure stories ever written: Alfred Lansing’s “Endurance.” Other explorers made their way into print by dying. John Franklin, who was lost in 1847 trying to find the Northwest Passage, inspired such titles as “The Man Who Ate His Boots.” The Norwegian Roald Amundsen both survived and disappeared. He forced the Northwest Passage in 1905 and then led the first expedition to the South Pole, recounting his adventures in several bestsellers. Amundsen later perished in an Arctic rescue mission. Conquest and tragedy fused to form the ideal polar hero.<br />The template for the romantic Arctic explorer was set 300 years earlier. As Andrea Pitzer writes in “Icebound,” William Barents of the Netherlands became the first European to journey into the icy void. “He was the patron saint of devoted error,” Ms. Pitzer asserts, attempting three times to find a northeast passage by sea over Russia to China in the late 16th century. Barents died in the effort while most of his crew survived. His crewmate Gerrit de Veer published a book telling the story. “Barents’s failures came from the immense adversity he faced,” Ms. Pitzer explains. “In time, that adversity itself would become the source of his fame.”<br />“Icebound” is a fascinating modern telling of Barents’s expeditions. The book faces limitations due to its very old source material: there is a dearth of known facts about Barents himself. Much of the extant record of his three voyages comes from de Veer’s contemporary account. Certain basic details have been lost, including the name of Barents’s ship and the man’s personality. As a result, “Icebound,” while fluid in its telling and thorough in its research, necessarily lacks the human element of the greatest adventure tales.<br />This is not to gainsay the book’s drama. Ms. Pitzer presents a compelling narrative situated in the context of Dutch imperial ambition. She writes vividly about the “unnerving isolation” of venturing north and east of Scandinavia into uncharted waters. “Going to sea can be challenging enough with a plotted course and an endpoint in mind,” she writes. “Sailing day after day without a map into unknown territory is a completely different experience. It’s impossible to know which kinds of shores, or what animals, wind, and weather may appear next. Any given tomorrow might have brought Barents or his men within sight of an open sea beckoning them to China.”<br />The open sea was a mirage—like so much else in the Arctic. A common theory since the time of the ancient Greeks posited that a warm polar ocean lay beyond the ice. It was said that crops could grow on land in its temperate climate, and that ships might sail freely over the north pole. Barents, who served as navigator, subscribed to this view. If he could prove it, then the Dutch, recently liberated from Spain, could achieve parity with other European powers by opening a faster trade route to the East.</td>

      <td>Frustrated by James Bond-style myths, John le Carré fashioned a literature of betrayal and the cost of secrets.</td>
      <td>The late John le Carré, born David John Moore Cornwell in 1931, liked to quote fellow English novelist Graham Greene to the effect that “childhood is the writer’s bank balance.” Thanks to an anxious upbringing, young David acquired enough authorial capital for the future le Carré to produce 26 books: tales of espionage and more that injected emotional complexity into “the secret world” and transformed spy fiction forever.<br />“The only relationship that I had as I grew up,” le Carré told a Beverly Hills audience in 1999, “was with my father . . . a mercurial, enormously attractive and totally amoral person who was, by profession, not to put too fine an edge on it, a confidence trickster and saw the inside of a number of prisons in his lifetime. The effect of that continues to haunt me.”<br />In his 2016 autobiographical collection “The Pigeon Tunnel,” le Carré recalled how “Ronnie the conman could spin you a story out of the air, sketch in a character who did not exist, and paint a golden opportunity when there wasn’t one.” When not separating gullible partners from their funds, his father could also be violent and was so to his first and second wives. “Ronnie beat me up, too,” le Carré wrote, “but only a few times and not with much conviction.” David’s abused mother (Ronnie’s first wife) left when he was 5, and the boy would spend his youth poring over business papers that his father kept boxed in the attic, seeking details of his dad’s larcenous schemes. “By the age of eight I was already a well-trained spy.”<br />The Oxford-educated David made espionage his career, working first for MI5, then MI6. He wrote his first two works of fiction—under a pseudonym, for security reasons—while still in his government’s employ. Starring in these books was an unprepossessing intelligence officer named George Smiley.<br />Le Carré wanted to up his literary game, partly, he claimed, in response to Ian Fleming’s James Bond fantasies of the 1950s and ’60s, which he dubbed “cultural pornography.” “It was a very rum thing,” he observed, “being in the secret world and watching the literary extension of it as a kind of saccharine vision of a life we didn’t live. Anybody involved in it I think would have been aware of the human cost, the incompetence, the constant cockups, the tragicomedy of it all. . . . Espionage . . . needed some kind of serious treatment, I thought.”</td>

      <td>Tiny towers, fake ruins and Greek temples for the garden: the joys of a very English architectural obsession.</td>
      <td>The subject of this discursive book is the architectural folly, which the British author Rory Fraser describes as “an elaborate building set in a beautiful landscape that serves no purpose other than to improve the view: architecture for the sake of architecture.” Follies originated as a feature of English and French 18th-century landscape gardening, and were typically Greek temples, turreted towers and picturesque ruins. The Great Pagoda in Kew Gardens is an example; so is the Temple of Love built for Marie-Antoinette in the garden of Versailles.<br />Mr. Fraser broadens the definition and includes other eccentric memorials and odd garden structures. He is drawn to their quirky architecture and equally to the stories behind their creation. Most writing about this subject has a condescending quality—what will they think of next? What distinguishes Mr. Fraser’s engaging book is that the author takes his unserious subject seriously, seeing follies as offering a portal into the past, “a diagonal glimpse of a soft underbelly that is rarely seen, revealing the dreams of those who built them when unconstrained by the contemporary equivalent of ‘building regs.’ ”<br />Rory Fraser is fortunate that in these trying times most readers will encounter his book online; it’s hard to know in which section of a bricks-and-mortar bookstore this slim volume would be shelved. “Follies” is a sort of travel book—it ranges over England with a side trip to Wales—but takes a narrower perspective than most books of this genre. It deals with history, from a 13th-century priory to a 20th-century obelisk, but its treatment of the past is idiosyncratic rather than scholarly. It is part memoir and part architectural diary, and illustrated not with plans and photographs but with the author’s charming watercolors, which give it an old-fashioned air that complements its subject.<br />Mr. Fraser is not an architect; he studied English at Oxford. This amateurism is all to the good because his book avoids the usual academic jargon and is a pleasure to read. Here he is describing Freston Tower in Suffolk: “Built at the height of Elizabethan England, the brickwork is beautifully mottled. Smoked browns and dusty reds form a narrow base, in turn fretted with diamonds in charcoal blue that rise up the side, culminating in four fantastic finials.” The tower stands beside the River Orwell and was built by a wealthy landowner to observe a ceremonial passage of the Virgin Queen’s barge. “What better way to attract her languid eye than to build a massive orange tower on the starboard side—complete with a portly merchant waving frantically from the top of it.”<br />Mr. Fraser’s occasionally ironic prose reminds me of Evelyn Waugh’s travel writing. Waugh comes to mind because one of the follies that Fraser visits is at the end of the garden of Castle Howard, the spectacular country house that was the setting for the 1981 televised version of “Brideshead Revisited.” Remember the scene where Sebastian Flyte and Charles Ryder are sampling wine in a fanciful garden pavilion? That domed room with its four Roman porticos—called the Temple of the Four Winds—was the work of the great architect John Vanbrugh, who also designed the main house. Vanbrugh was inspired by Palladio’s Villa Rotonda, but he transformed the Renaissance villa, shrank its dimensions and added Jacobean flourishes as well as a curious Mughal dome. “A shapeshifting folly—surely not?” the author asks, but he is reminded that Vanbrugh spent time in India as a young man, and that John Soane described him as “the Shakespeare of architects.” “Just as Shakespeare played around with a still molten language to revolutionise English theatre, so too did Vanbrugh with architectural elements—based on his own experiences—to create a new national Baroque that was distinct from its Catholic European counterparts,” Mr. Fraser trenchantly observes.</td>

      <td>While the historic agreement signed by the U.K. and European Union on Christmas Eve removes the risk of very bad economic outcomes, it leaves much up in the air</td>
      <td>For the Brexit process, the deal announced by the U.K. and the European Union on Christmas Eve marks a long-awaited end to the beginning.<br />For business and markets, it removes the worst of the risks associated with Britain’s decision to quit the trading bloc. The two sides no longer face the prospect of tariffs or quotas on each other’s goods from Jan. 1—an outcome that would have massively disrupted trade patterns that have built up over decades in products such as food, vehicles and airplanes.<br />That explains sterling’s roughly 1% rise against the euro since talk of a deal gained steam on Wednesday. A worst-case scenario that was dragging down the average view of Britain’s economic prospects has been removed.<br />This doesn’t mean the prospects are great. Even with a tariff-free trade deal, the U.K. government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, previously forecast that Britain’s output would be 4% lower than it might have been if the country had remained within the bloc, mainly because “nontariff barriers” such as divergent regulations and customs checks will reduce trade. Sterling is still close to historic lows against the euro.<br />Of course, signals from currency markets and the outputs of economic forecasting models both need to be taken with a fistful of salt. Optimists see plenty of opportunity for the U.K. now that it can sign trade deals with third parties. Where they agree with the pessimists is that the long-term nature of Britain’s relationship with its biggest trading partner has yet to be fully determined. The U.K. sent 43% of its exports to the EU last year, while 52% of U.K. imports came from the bloc.</td>

      <td>Finding the balance between the twin myths of Graham Greene’s inner demons and his questing spirit.</td>
      <td>In stark chronological terms, Graham Greene (1904-1991) was a member of that spangled generation of British writers born in the golden decade between 1900 and 1910, a logjam of talent that included such mighty timbers as George Orwell and Evelyn Waugh (both born in 1903), Christopher Isherwood (1904), Anthony Powell and Henry Green (both 1905) and W.H. Auden (1907). Generational solidarity went only so far among this gang of highly individual Edwardian contenders, and so the views of Greene held by his professional peers are always worth attending to.<br />Waugh, for example, admired Greene’s work, shared his religious convictions but distrusted his politics. Orwell filed a no-holds-barred review of “The Heart of the Matter” (1948) for the New Yorker in which he accused Greene of glamorizing sin and regarding hell as a “high-class nightclub” with entry reserved exclusively for Roman Catholics. But it was Powell, brought news of the 86-year-old Greene’s death (in the Swiss hospital where he was being treated for aplastic anaemia), who left the most searing judgment: a valediction so wounding that it was confided to Powell’s diary rather than the newspapers who had asked for tributes.<br />“From the word go I had found his books wholly unreadable,” Powell begins, “long before there could have been any question of jealousy.” Good at reportage, he conceded, a lively journalist and an astute businessman, but the novels are “vulgarised Conrad” further cheapened by religious propaganda, and as for the personality of the man who wrote them, “I think he was completely cynical, really only liking sex and money and his own particular form of publicity.” There is also talk of a “colossal row” dating from the post-World War II days, when for a brief period Greene, in his capacity as a director of the firm of Eyre & Spottiswoode, was Powell’s publisher.<br />The “row” is more extensively, yet still obliquely, covered in Powell’s memoirs. It involved Powell’s group biography “John Aubrey and His Friends” (1948). Owing to a combination of paper shortages and publisher inertia, the work had still not appeared in print two years after it was accepted. When Powell, not unreasonably, complained about this delay, Greene lost his temper and declared that “it’s a bloody boring book anyway.” The memorialist professed himself “ruffled.” In reality, as Richard Greene (no relation) reveals in this diligently researched biography, the two men did not speak for the next dozen years. Powell further remarks about the contretemps that Greene “would go white with rage on such occasions, admitting that he had to have rows from time to time for his health.”<br />Powell signs off with mention of Greene’s “delight in polemics, causing trouble.” It has to be said that few of these asperities survive into “The Unquiet Englishman: A Life of Graham Greene.” This, as its author acknowledges, is intended as a corrective to Norman Sherry’s mammoth three-volume endeavor “The Life of Graham Greene” (1989-2004) and Michael Shelden’s “Graham Greene: The Enemy Within” (1995), both of which went to town on their subject’s sexual peccadilloes and his supposed deviousness. Greene’s Greene, alternatively, is, if not exactly a benign, healing presence, then a force for good in the political and ethical debates of his day—a mythmaker, certainly, and a creature of the will but, for all his trafficking with the devil, indisputably on the angels’ side.</td>

      <td>Contemporary novelists readily take on the end of the world. The end of a life is a tougher subject.</td>
      <td>There is a hole in contemporary fiction that has been noticeable for some time but was especially conspicuous in this year. Novelists are obsessed with the apocalypse and have envisioned countless scenarios for the downfall of civilization. Equally, they are transfixed by grief and repeatedly are drawn to produce meditations on loss and recovery. But they do not like to write about the subtext of these preoccupations, the thing that they are hinting toward or circling around, cautiously evoking yet usually leaving off the page. They do not like to write about death.<br />How to write about something no one among the living has experienced? In his “Aspects of the Novel,” E.M. Forster observes: “There is scarcely anything that the novelist cannot borrow from ‘daily death’; scarcely anything he may not profitably invent. The doors of that darkness lie open to him and he can even follow his characters through it, provided he is shod with imagination.” The novelist’s inherent ignorance is in fact the source of unmatched artistic possibility, and when we think of the most enduring writers we can nearly always match them with an unforgettable death scene. The death may be noble, like Sydney Carton’s in “A Tale of Two Cities,” or wretched, like Madame Bovary’s; it may be romantic, like Dr. Zhivago’s, or hideously meaningless, like the suffering child’s in Camus’s “The Plague”; but it is always present.<br />Such scenes are the exception now, implied but rarely confronted, and in this reticence, I think, literature is running downstream from culture at large. Western society, having insulated itself from the reality of death more successfully than any collection of people in human history, is uncomfortable with reminders of its inevitability. Death has become as we imagine sex was to the Victorians: a taboo, unsuitable for mixed company—one of the last unmentionable subjects.<br />Much of our perceived immunity to death disappeared in 2020, and so far as that affected reading habits, it was perfectly reasonable to want books that provided the escapism that had become harder to find in real life. I felt that too. But amid the tensions and anxieties, the uninterrupted blare of ambulance sirens, the close calls and the tragedies, I also found myself searching for books that looked plainly at death, even as I rearranged my life to elude it.<br />Echoing Plato and Cicero, Montaigne famously declared: “To philosophize is to learn how to die.” “To begin depriving death of its greatest advantage over us,” he wrote, “let us adopt a way clean contrary to that common one; let us deprive death of its strangeness; let us frequent it, let us get used to it; let us have nothing more often in mind than death.” Literature can help us with this as well. In his novel “My Red Heaven,” which was published in January, before most people could have foreseen the shape the year would take, Lance Olsen puts the matter more imperatively: “Art doesn’t make life more bearable or longer or impervious to anguish. Its real goal is the opposite: to teach you that nobody can be saved in the end.”</td>

      <td>A look at well-intentioned but off-target books for little ones—and a few that hit the mark.</td>
      <td>Most of the year, this column is devoted to the best new books for young readers. Not so this week. As a last gasp of our annus horribilis, let’s talk about what makes for a bad book; specifically, what makes for a lousy board book for babies and toddlers. As for why publishers produced so many, I suppose the usual answer applies: It’s 2020. What do you expect?<br />To understand why some board books are great and some suboptimal, you have to consider who is meant to read them. Children ages 0-3 haven’t been here very long. They’re learning our language, but they may not speak it yet. In their first few months, they don’t even see colors; their world is black, white and gray. As children grow, they learn to discriminate between sounds and shapes and attach names to people, animals and objects. They start to learn spatial concepts (up/down, in/out) and mathematical ideas (one versus many). The concept of zero, which seems obvious to grown-ups, is not grasped by most children until after the age of 4.<br />In other words, babies and toddlers are not like us; they don’t know what we know. Good board books respect this innocence—young children’s newness to words and pictures—and meet them where they are. In 2020, I am happy to say, there were some great ones, brimming with humor and beauty and appropriate for their audience. Creative Editions published “Egg,” with simple, delightful rhymes by Amy Sky Koster and exquisite illustrations by Lisel Jane Ashlock. Candlewick Press brought out Kenneth Kraegel’s droll and surprising board book “This Is a Book of Shapes” and Steve Light’s deceptively sophisticated concept book “Up Cat Down Cat.” Minedition produced Giuliano Ferri’s “Masquerade Party,” a satisfying layering of ideas and language with sturdy fold-out panels. “Who is this plucky pirate?” we read. When the fellow’s hat is lifted away, the answer appears: “It’s a playful pig.”<br />There were board books that, while great in theory, slightly missed the mark. Xavier Deneux’s construction-site illustrations for “Build!” have graphic appeal, but the book’s removable, puzzle-like pieces are exasperatingly liable to disappear into the sofa cushions. Sam Boughton’s pictures for Templar’s “Hello, Elephant!” and “Hello, Bear!” are so splashy and distempered, and the typeface for his prose so scraggly, that it may be hard for small eyes to know where to look. The same is true of Isobel Lundie’s illustrations for “The Amicus Book of Earth,” from Amicus Ink, which feel flat and crowded on the small page.<br />Then we come to a category we might call “too much too soon.” These 2020 board books are not really for little ones, mostly because they presume a body of knowledge that babies and toddlers don’t have. Little, Brown’s “The Princess Bride: A Counting Story” by Lena Wolfe—based on the PG movie and illustrated by Bill Robinson—begins: “1 Story, 2 Lovers, 3 Outlaws.” Another entry from this category is Putnam’s four-volume “Big Ideas for Little Philosophers” series by Duane Armitage and Maureen McQuerry, with pictures by Robin Rosenthal. “A philosopher is a person who loves wisdom,” toddlers learn from “Truth With Socrates.” “Wisdom means knowing things that help you live better and be happy.” In “Equality With Simone de Beauvoir,” children get this message: “We don’t have to be the way everyone expects us to be. We just have to be ourselves.” (Hmm, the philosophical parent may think: not when it comes to table manners.)</td>

      <td>Covid has turned even cultural luminaries into homebodies. We asked 18 musicians, actors, artists, designers and authors to share their favorite quarantine discoveries.</td>
      <td>IT FEELS almost callous to call anything a silver lining in 2020, but during this tumultuous year, many people eagerly took shelter in culture, high and low. Film, TV, books and music gave us relief and a center of gravity. In the interest of tallying up the silver linings and seeking recommendations to help us weather the next few months, we asked 18 well-known cultural figures to share their favorite quarantine discoveries and comfort fare. Many were drawn to the familiar. Actor Jon Hamm, for example, spent part of his downtime consuming comedies from the 1970s and 1980s that he remembered from his youth. “I found myself, like a lot of people, going back to what feels comfortable and knowable, because so much of our existence in the last eight months has been uncomfortable and unknowable,” he said.<br />Others took this strangely antisocial period to get acquainted with a classic work of art they’d always pledged to tackle. This was the year to gorge on Wong Kar-wai films or sink into Tolstoy. And then there was Slime. The gooey substance adored by children and shunned by parents might not be everyone’s idea of a cultural touchstone, but musician Norah Jones, we learned, is a recent convert and vouches for its therapeutic properties. For his part, Swizz Beatz thrilled at excavating Marvin Gaye. “I was in that zone, just digging up everything I could find from him,” he told us. Candice Bergen found herself happily burrowing into the “Wolf Hall” trilogy and keeping company with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly in “To Catch a Thief.” As she admitted, “I’m behind on stuff. I’ve just gone into sludge mode.”<br />Quarantine Discovery ’70s and ’80s comedy classics that he grew up with, such as ‘Beverly Hills Cop,’ ‘48 Hrs.’ and ‘Fun with Dick and Jane.’ “A lot of iconic comedies, the tone of which and pace of which they don’t really make anymore,” said Mr. Hamm. Also on the list: the 1985 Chevy Chase film “Fletch.” (It was recently announced that Mr. Hamm will star in a reboot.)<br />Up Next Finishing current TV series like “Lovecraft Country” and “The Queen’s Gambit.”<br />Quarantine Discovery Timbaland has been consumed by Prince’s discography, especially his self-titled 1979 album. “I started to dive into the sonics, just trying to understand the difference between warm tape and digital because I feel like Prince had cracked the code when that album came out.” Mr. Beatz has been listening to a lot of Marvin Gaye. “It’s just a classic. Even the Marvin Gaye albums that weren’t famous, you know, ‘Here, My Dear,’ and so many of them that were never mainstream records but then you go back and find these discoveries.”</td>

      <td>Homebound holidays make knowing how to mix a drink particularly rewarding. And it doesn’t have to be complex.</td>
      <td>Last December a group of cocktail virtuosi in Washington, D.C., put on their annual holiday cocktail seminar. The invitation promised that “DC’s finest bartenders” would present original holiday cocktails. “They’ll tell the story of what inspired the drink, and show you how to make the drink at home,” the promoters said. “And best of all, they’ll serve it to you!”<br />That was so 2019.<br />The advertisement for this year’s event was a little different. “Cocktails will be batched and placed into plastic pouches, which may be collected” to go. For $50, virtual attendees were promised “6 pre-mixed cocktails . . . just bring them home and enjoy!” There was a caveat: “Some drinks might involve shaking, heating, or other final preparation.”<br />Such has been the effect of lockdowns on the bougie world of high-end mixed drinks. A year ago a craft cocktail meant an elaborate concoction painstakingly constructed and extravagantly presented. Now it’s a premixed drink in a plastic bag. À votre santé.<br />The irony is that the artisanal-cocktail movement was born, in no small part, out of a rejection of prefab drinks. Dale DeGroff, a bartender and pioneer in the craft-cocktail movement, penned a 2002 book titled, appropriately, “The Craft of the Cocktail.” An authoritative mix of recipes and techniques with a dash of anecdotes, the collection helped reintroduce a thirsty public to whole categories of forgotten drinks, such as cobblers.</td>

      <td>Selected by Rachel Holmes, author of ‘Sylvia Pankhurst: Natural Born Rebel.’</td>
      <td>By Amanda Foreman (2010)<br />1. There are few better guides to understanding the relationship between the U.S. and Britain than this immersive history of Britain’s role in the American Civil War. Startlingly, we discover that the war divided Britain as bitterly as Brexit does today. Whiggish English politicians sided with the North, but just as many staunchly supported the Confederacy, despite slavery’s having long been abolished in the British empire. America was Britain’s greatest trading partner—cotton was king. Amanda Foreman writes with bracing verve about the people who were a part of this history. We board naval ships, follow British volunteers into the heat of battle (on both sides) and observe Nathaniel Hawthorne, the U.S. consul in Liverpool, writing “I hate England.” We encounter John Roebuck, a member of Parliament, who regards Southern plantation owners as honorary Englishmen and the Northern immigrant hordes as “the scum and refuse of Europe.” All testimony to the visceral passions on this subject that were soon forgotten. To no two other countries would the term “special relationship” ever be more appropriately applied.<br />By Nadine Gordimer (1979)<br />2. The daughter of dissident antiapartheid activists, Rosa Burger—whose Afrikaans surname means “citizen”—knows what it is to be brought up by politically committed parents persecuted as traitors to their tribe. In Nadine Gordimer’s novel, it is 1974 and Rosa, now 26 and parentless, has fled South Africa for Europe. At a party in London, she publicly offends her adopted black brother by using his diminutive childhood nickname. Later that night, he telephones her. “I’m not ‘Baasie,’ I’m Zwelinzima Vulindlela. . . . You know what my name means, Rosa? . . . ‘Suffering land.’ ” Gordimer captures the impact of racialized civil war not just between but within families. Finally alive to the meaning of Baasie’s name, rather than just the irony of her own, Rosa finds her way home to South Africa to reclaim her political inheritance.<br />By Maaza Mengiste (2019)</td>

      <td>Natural gas will play a key role in the shift to renewable energy, but that is no guarantee it will provide good returns</td>
      <td>As a relatively clean fossil fuel, natural gas will play a useful role for years to come. It is less certain that it will be a profitable one.<br />Exuberant investment in new gas reserves and liquefaction facilities in recent years helped globalize the market but also created a glut. Growing Asian demand has pushed prices up dramatically this month, raising hopes of better times. But any sustained recovery in prices and profits will require fossil-fuel producers to resist the temptation to overinvest once again in their favorite green-transition fuel.<br />Future gas demand will balance two major trends: growing prosperity in Asia driving an increase in consumption; and declining sales in Europe and North America. Future profitability depends on how well supply and demand match up.<br />The world’s biggest economies have promised radical change. The European Union, Japan, South Korea and the U.K. have all committed to cut their net emissions to zero by 2050, while China is aiming for 2060. The U.S. under the Biden administration may join them.<br />Natural gas will likely play two key roles in that green transition: replacing coal-fired power plants until sufficient renewables production can be built; and fueling backup peaker plants to bridge the gaps in intermittent wind and solar generation.</td>

Then, after talks continued through the night, on Thursday morning.<br />However on Thursday afternoon, negotiations were continuing, with the two teams ensconced in the EU executive’s 13-floor 1960s Berlaymont building, snacking on deliveries of pizza and sandwiches.</td>

      <td>Even as more Americans get Covid-19 vaccinations, diagnostic manufacturers, employers and public-health authorities are pushing to expand testing for the virus over the next several months to help curb its still-surging spread.<br />The goal is that more-frequent testing, along with other mitigation measures such as mask wearing and social distancing, can get people back into classrooms and workplaces before the wider availability of vaccines.<br />“While we’re in the process of immunizing the American people, we must keep our guard up,” Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, who oversees Covid-19 testing, said at a media briefing last week. “You can expect more at-home and screening testing, like before you go to work, before you travel.”<br />Some large employers, including companies such as  Netflix Inc.,  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  recently started expanding testing for workers, looking to screen people without symptoms. Last week, Google started offering weekly testing for its 90,000 U.S. employees, and airlines and tourist organizations are hoping that testing will get people back in the air.<br />The U.S. will likely be able to perform more than 70 million Covid-19 tests a week by the end of January, according to recent estimates from the Rockefeller Foundation. By April, that is expected to grow to 200 million weekly tests. The growth will be driven by tests done outside laboratories, including in schools and doctors’ offices, and those processed at home. Increasing the number of patient samples analyzed in a single test, a technique known as pooling, will also likely contribute, the foundation said.</td>

      <td>BERLIN—For years, Victoria Bergstrom has been waiting for this moment, a rite of passage, finally to be 21 years old and able take part in the family tradition of drinking a glass of Swedish Glögg together on Christmas Day.<br />But this isn’t exactly how the American student imagined it. Instead of sitting together around the Christmas tree in Portsmouth, R.I., opening presents and nipping at a cup of hot, spiced wine, she is stuck at college in the Netherlands, and plans to join the family ritual in a video chat, thousands of miles away because of the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Ms. Bergstrom’s parents are elderly, the prime risk group for contracting Covid-19, and her father isn’t in good health. So, she decided to not return home for Christmas to avoid unwittingly bringing the coronavirus with her.<br />“I could go home, but I won’t because I don’t want to put my parents at risk,” Ms. Bergstrom says. “I would rather spend one holiday and not see my family and get 10 or 15 more in the future.”<br />Usually at this time of year, millions of students in college towns all around the world put away their books and make the journey to celebrate the holidays with family. But the pandemic has cast a shadow over the traditional homecoming.</td>

      <td>The Los Olivos, Calif., property underwent a series of price cuts after hitting the market in 2015</td>
      <td>Michael Jackson’s onetime Neverland ranch has sold for $22 million to billionaire Ron Burkle, a onetime associate of the late pop star and co-founder of the investment firm Yucaipa Companies, according to public records and three people familiar with the deal.<br />The property, located about 40 miles from Santa Barbara, had been on and off the market for years, first listing for $100 million in 2015 and undergoing several price cuts. It was listed for $31 million last year, The Wall Street Journal reported.<br />Mr. Jackson’s estate co-owned the ranch with a fund managed by  Colony Capital ,  a real-estate investment trust. Amid financial struggles, Mr. Jackson had defaulted on a loan backed by the ranch and Colony bought the note in 2008, putting the property’s title into a joint venture it formed with the pop star. Mr. Jackson originally paid about $19.5 million for the ranch in 1987.<br />Mr. Jackson made Neverland famous by installing quirky features like a railroad and an amusement park, which included a Ferris wheel and a merry-go-round. He also kept orangutans and an elephant there. A whimsical floral clock in the front of the property spelled out “Neverland.” The ranch was named for the fantasy world in J.M. Barrie’s “Peter Pan.”<br />The Los Olivos property spans about 2,700 acres and includes about 22 structures, including a 12,000-square-foot Normandy-style mansion. There are also several guesthouses, a swimming pool with a cabana, a basketball court, a tennis court and a 50-seat movie theater, The Wall Street Journal reported when the property came on the market.</td>
