      <td>The possibility of a bond-market tantrum or higher inflation has supplanted pandemic-related concerns</td>
      <td>During earnings season in the middle of a pandemic, there would seem to be no shortage of things for investors to fret about. Could a new variant of the virus knock markets? Or negative guidance from a major American company reset earnings expectations?<br />Perhaps not. An offhand comment by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellenabout interest rates on Tuesday revealed what is fueling market sentiment, to the exception of almost anything else.<br />Speaking at an event with the Atlantic, Ms. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn’t overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy.” She was referring in particular to the Biden administration’s planned long-term spending, some of it years down the line, when the economy will probably be much closer to full employment.<br />To be sure, the market was already down for the day when the Treasury Secretary’s comments hit the wires, but it’s telling that such an anodyne remark—by someone who knows very well the clear demarcation between Federal Reserve and Treasury policy—could deliver such a jolt. Ms. Yellen walked back her comments later, at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit.<br />How the Fed reacts to the economic recovery and the administration’s bulging spending plans isn’t all that matters, but it sometimes seems like investors believe that it is. Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly stressed that the Fed intends to sit on its hands and allow inflation to stray marginally above 2% without acting to cool the economy.</td>

Mr. Floyd’s death sparked a summer of unrest in Minneapolis and across the country.<br />Eric Nelson, Mr. Chauvin’s attorney, requested a hearing where the judge could reinterview some jurors. He said the purpose of the questioning is to show the jury “committed misconduct, felt threatened or intimidated, felt race based pressure during the proceedings, and/or failed to adhere to instructions during deliberations, in violation of Mr. Chauvin’s constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.”<br />Mr. Nelson didn’t name a specific juror or explain what misconduct he is alleging in a court filing Tuesday. He asked the court to grant him more time to fully investigate the issues.<br />Judge Peter Cahill has denied requests for a retrial at multiple points during the proceedings after Mr. Nelson said that the jury was being swayed by pressure to convict Mr. Chauvin out of fear that a failure to convict would unleash a new round of social unrest in Minneapolis.</td>

Legal experts noted that the search was an unusual step for prosecutors to take, particularly because Mr. Giuliani has served as the personal lawyer of former President Donald Trump.<br />“[U]nder exceptional circumstances, the appointment of a special master to review materials seized from an attorney may be appropriate,” the prosecutors wrote. “Those circumstances may exist where the search involves the files of a criminal defense attorney with cases adverse” to the prosecutors’ office.<br />The three assistant U.S. attorneys on the letter are part of the office’s public corruption unit and are also the prosecutors on the campaign-finance case involving several of Mr. Giuliani’s associates. The letter—which said a grand-jury investigation was under way—was written to U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken, who is also overseeing that case.</td>

Mr. and Ms. Gates gave $36.8 billion to the organization between 1994 and 2020, according to the foundation.<br />Mr. and Ms. Gates said in a statement posted simultaneously to their Twitter accounts on Monday that they would continue to work together at their foundation. “We continue to share a belief in that mission,” they said.<br />No changes in their roles or the organization are planned, a foundation spokesperson said.

      <td>Editor’s note: This week’s Future View is about President Biden’s first 100 days in office. Next week we’ll ask, “Does ‘equity’ demand the elimination of gifted-and-talented programs in schools?” The argument has been made most recently within New York City’s Department of Education. Students can click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before May 11. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Intimidating the Court<br />On his 80th day in office, President Biden advertised his worst tendencies. He empaneled a Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court to make “an appraisal of the merits and legality of particular reform proposals,” most notoriously what is termed “court packing.”<br />While expanding the Supreme Court would delegitimize the institution—the last rational federal institution in the U.S.—the existence of the commission is itself a way to intimidate the current Supreme Court justices. How might jurists who esteem their court, who value its history and integrity, respond to the credible threat of debasement by the executive? Consider the history of court packing under Franklin Roosevelt. When the Supreme Court in the 1930s deemed several pieces of New Deal legislation unconstitutional, President Roosevelt attempted to “vitalize” the court with younger, like-minded justices. This initiative failed due to a few men of integrity within Roosevelt’s own party, but the message was received. Roosevelt secured a much friendlier Supreme Court thereafter.</td>

The outfit that is supposed to offer credible, unbiased scientific guidance has been found again to be politicizing virus policy.<br />The New York Post reported over the weekend that the CDC consulted American Federation of Teachers (AFT) chief Randi Weingarten in writing its guidelines for school openings. The chronology of this non-scientific political intervention is even worse than it sounds.<br />In early February, new CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters in a press conference that “schools can safely reopen and that safe reopening does not suggest that teachers need to be vaccinated.” Oops. She forgot to consult the expert opinion of Ms. Weingarten, a major supporter of President Biden.<br />After unions howled, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Dr. Walensky was speaking in her “personal capacity,” not providing “official guidance” from the CDC. A couple of weeks later, the CDC rolled out official school reopening guidelines that recommended teachers be given “high priority” for vaccines and curiously echoed other union demands.<br />Now we know why. Emails obtained by the New York Post showed that the AFT union reviewed a CDC draft and made recommendations that union officials said would “strengthen the document.” The CDC adopted two of the union’s suggestions nearly verbatim.</td>

      <td>The Treasure State will refuse extra federal jobless payments.</td>
      <td>The economy is roaring back as government lockdowns finally end, and employers are struggling to find workers. Enter Montana with a novel idea: telling the feds that it doesn’t want their extra payments for not working.<br />On Tuesday Gov. Greg Gianforte said that by June 27 Montana will end its participation in the federal supplemental unemployment benefit program that provides the jobless with an additional $300 a week through September. Congress enacted the bonus in its Covid legislation, but Mr. Gianforte believes it has become a disincentive to work. So do most economists.<br />Montana already offers a maximum individual unemployment benefit of $572 a week, and with the federal bonus the jobless can collect the equivalent of up to $21.80 an hour for doing nothing. With state and federal benefits combined, about half of Montana’s workers make more than their prior earnings while on unemployment, says University of Chicago economist Peter Ganong.<br />State Commissioner of Labor and Industry Laurie Esau estimates that Montana’s labor force is down some 10,000 workers from pre-pandemic levels. Nearly 25,250 Montanans collected unemployment this week, but the state’s jobs website reports more than 14,000 open positions. In March Montana’s unemployment rate was 3.8%.<br />Montana also plans to issue regulations strengthening requirements so those collecting unemployment checks must show that they are able and available to work and actively looking for a job.</td>

While they’re playing defense in the minority for now, their prospects for picking up the five net seats they need to regain the majority in 2022 are excellent. That is, unless they devolve into internal brawling over the 2020 election.<br />Yet that’s precisely what they seem to be doing as some Members try to oust Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney from the GOP House leadership. Ms. Cheney easily survived an earlier effort to dump her, 145-61, after she was one of 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach Donald Trump after the events of Jan. 6.<br />But she continues to rankle some in the GOP House conference by refusing to go along with Mr. Trump’s demand that Republicans agree that the 2020 election was stolen. On Monday Mr. Trump issued a statement that “The Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE!”<br />Ms. Cheney responded on  Twitter : “The 2020 presidential election was not stolen. Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system.”<br />This has angered some in the House GOP, and on Tuesday Axios caught House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on a hot mic saying “I’ve had it with her.” But Mr. McCarthy knows Ms. Cheney is right. The election wasn't stolen, yet Mr. Trump wants an endorsement of his stolen claim to be a litmus test for every Republican candidate. He’s the one who wants to refight his losing campaign.</td>

      <td>Did the FBI set up two Members of Congress for political attack under the guise of a “defensive briefing”? It’s possible, and Senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley are rightly demanding answers.<br />On Monday the Republicans sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines asking how the Washington Post came to know about an FBI briefing to both Senators on Aug. 6, 2020. A Post story last week used the info to smear Mr. Johnson and his report on Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings, suggesting that he’d ignored FBI warnings and thus may have been manipulated by the Kremlin. The newspaper cited only anonymous “current and former U.S. officials.”<br />In their letter the Senators note that the briefing came after “pressure from Democratic Leadership.” In July 2020, the Democratic Members of the Gang of Eight—senior Members with access to intelligence secrets—had sent a letter and classified addendum to Mr. Wray specifically citing the Johnson-Grassley probe into Hunter Biden as reason for an urgent briefing for Congress about foreign “disinformation.” That news was then leaked, in what was an obvious attempt to tar the work of the two Republicans.<br />The two Senators became more concerned when the ensuing briefing by the FBI turned out to be what they described as “not specific” as well as “unconnected to our investigation.” (Their report was based on U.S. government documents.) They specifically expressed to the FBI during the briefing their concerns that it would be “subject to a leak” for partisan gain. Which is exactly what happened last week, despite the FBI’s promise to the Senators of confidentiality.<br />After the August briefing, Messrs. Johnson and Grassley sent a letter demanding that Mr. Wray and the intelligence community disclose the reason for it. They never received the answer. In light of last week’s leak, they are renewing their demand to know who recommended the briefing, and the intelligence that supposedly supported it.</td>

      <td>Liberal voters rebuke leftist politicians for a policy that brought homeless encampments to the city’s public spaces.</td>
      <td>Austin, Texas<br />Voters in this deeply liberal city overwhelmingly approved a proposal last week to reinstate a ban on camping in public places, dealing a harsh rebuke to Mayor Steve Adler and his fellow Democrats. It turns out there’s a limit to what even the most progressive electorate will tolerate.<br />The vote came amid a homelessness crisis in the city caused almost entirely by Mr. Adler and the Austin City Council’s 2019 decision to rescind a 23-year-old ordinance that prohibited camping in public places such as sidewalks, city parks and highway medians, as well as ordinances against panhandling and sitting or lying down in public. The predictable result was the emergence of San Francisco-style homeless encampments all over the city, especially downtown, which was soon inundated with aggressive panhandling, public intoxication and debris-strewn tent cities.<br />At the time, Mr. Adler said the answer to Austin’s homelessness problem wasn’t to arrest people for sleeping on the streets, an approach he called “ineffective and inconsistent with the character of this city.” He offered more publicly funded housing and services for the homeless, following the “Housing First” policy mantra of West Coast cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle. “We need places where homeless folks can be safe and surrounded by social workers and others getting them the help and support they need,” Mr. Adler said.<br />And he meant it. Along with the repeal of the camping ban, Mr. Adler and the all-Democrat city council appropriated more than $73 million for homeless-related services in 2020, a record for the city. It was so much money that the city had trouble spending it. By December Austin had doled out only 57%, or $42.3 million, which still amounted to tens of thousands of dollars per homeless person. Yet the problem kept getting worse.</td>

      <td>How can a communist country treat capital gains more favorably than the U.S. does?</td>
      <td>The concept driving President Biden’s tax proposals for individuals is that the long-term capital gains and dividends of wealthy investors should be taxed as ordinary income. If the concept becomes law, the U.S. will have hamstrung itself economically by impairing a key engine of growth—the individual risk-taking needed to start companies and create jobs.<br />The current top rate on long-term capital gains is 23.8%: 20% plus the 3.8% investment-income surtax. Mr. Biden proposes to push the top rate to 39.6% plus the 3.8% surtax, for a total of 43.4%<br />In the business and financial world it is generally understood that long-term capital gains are different from ordinary income and thus should be taxed differently and at lower rates. Long-term capital gains can be heavily eroded by inflation. Lower capital-gains tax rates reward the patient capital needed to create and build business. Also, net capital losses are generally not deductible from taxable income. So if government isn’t willing to share fully in the losses from risky economic investing, it shouldn’t take a large part of any net gains.<br />Capital is mobile, so the issue must be considered globally. Looking at the world’s 10 largest economies, not one currently taxes individual long-term capital gains at or close to ordinary income rates.<br />The most critical comparison is between the U.S. and China, which has adopted key Western investment policies and made no secret of its desire to become the world’s leading economy. Mr. Biden has acknowledged this, calling Beijing’s intentions to displace U.S. global leadership “deadly earnest.” The top capital-gains tax rate for Chinese investors is 20%. Chinese citizens are allowed—even encouraged—to buy and own stocks in Chinese companies. They can invest and become wealthy as long as they don’t challenge the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese model, a political dictatorship, a market economy, and low taxes for investors, continues to generate rapid economic gains.</td>

The implications have already been far reaching, helping to suppress inflation, boost profits, and sustain solid gains in real wages after nine years of stagnation. . . .<br />One factor which accounts for part of the productivity surge is the investment boom which has driven the latter part of the expansion, the consequence of an historic shift in the stance of fiscal policy.

It’s a claim Democrats aren’t embarrassed to make when one of their own is presiding over the sort of job market we’re starting to enjoy, in which employers make attractive offers to people without skills or experience or credentials, or who have a checkered criminal history.<br />“The best anti-poverty program is a job,” tweeted Barack Obama to mark a particularly good monthly report in May 2015.<br />“The great economic boom of the 1990s lifted the fortunes of almost every disadvantaged group, including racial minorities, high school dropouts and single mothers,” jubilated the Los Angeles Times in the late Clinton years.<br />“America Is ‘Fully Employed,’ But Some Still Need Jobs,” snarked the  New York Times  at the same stage of the Reagan boom.<br />A job may not be a solution for somebody who can’t work or can’t find a job, or who has behavioral problems or is disabled, but hiring binges are engines of social amelioration. We’re on the cusp of such a boom now, or perhaps reacquainting ourselves with the Trump boom. Fifteen million job vacancies were begging by late March, five million more than before the pandemic.

      <td>Abraham Lincoln stands among the foremost lyricists of the American experience. His first inaugural address called on a divided citizenry’s “better angels” to uphold the sacred inviolability of the Union. His Gettysburg Address envisioned a nation baptized by the blood of battle into “a new birth of freedom.” And his second inaugural meditated on a just God chastening a republic of liberty that tolerated slavery.<br />How did Lincoln arrive at these arresting ideas and phrases? As far as we know, he didn’t leave a personal diary to posterity. But he did bequeath 109 surviving fragments or notes that feature what he called his “best” (though often “disconnected”) thoughts. In scrawled penmanship, Lincoln explored a range of subjects: the mysteries of nature, a lawyer’s public reputation, the immorality of slavery, the active role of God in human affairs. These notes—some no more than a few sentences, others multiple paragraphs—were not, according to Lincoln’s personal secretaries, John Nicolay and John Hay, “written to be seen by men.”<br />Lincoln’s confidential ruminations are the subject of Ronald C. White’s “Lincoln in Private,” an intimate character portrait and fascinating inquiry into the basis of Lincoln’s energetic, curious mind. Mr. White, whose masterly biography of Lincoln appeared in 2009, regards Lincoln’s notes as the “building blocks” of his political philosophy and of his sense of self. “The function of Lincoln’s fragments”—all of which are reprinted in the book—“is for him to write in private what he may not yet be willing to say in public.”<br />Lincoln cherished careful, authoritative rhetoric. He used his private jottings to confront problems, establish propositions, exercise the limits of his arguments and anticipate critics’ rejoinders—all before announcing his public positions. He wrote to himself as both a meditative thinker and as a careful practitioner who searched for the precise word or phrase and who often set rigid standards for himself. The “leading rule” for all aspiring professionals, the lawyer Lincoln recorded in 1850, “is diligence. Leave nothing for tomorrow which can be done today.” To fulfill an ambitious life was “to be honest at all events.” We see in Lincoln’s fragments a poised and resolute intellectual. We also see a vulnerable individual humbled by the precariousness of the nation and of its vast, uncertain future.<br />When Illinois Sen. Stephen A. Douglas’s 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act granted citizens the right to decide for themselves the fate of slavery in the western territories, Lincoln retreated to his private thoughts to work through the inconsistencies of Douglas’s “popular sovereignty.” “If A. can prove, however conclusively, that he may, of right, enslave B.,” Lincoln wrote to himself, “why may not B. snatch the same argument, and prove equally, that he may enslave A.?” Put another way, was democracy moral when a political majority curtailed the natural rights of another people who themselves were deprived of electoral consent? Lincoln’s resounding “no” to this question informed his Peoria speech (1854) and his debates with Douglas in 1858, fueling his rise in the Republican Party.</td>

      <td>Majority of shareholder votes are cast against compensation plans for GE’s Larry Culp and AT&T’s John Stankey</td>
      <td>Shareholders at  General Electric Co.  and  AT&T Inc.  rejected the companies’ executive compensation plans in nonbinding votes, the latest blue-chip companies to be rebuked by investors over how they paid leaders during the pandemic.<br />Nearly 58% of  GE  shares were voted against the board’s compensation practices, according to an initial tally announced at the GE annual meeting Tuesday. Less than half of shares cast at AT&T’s meeting last week supported the telecom and media giant’s compensation plans, the company said Friday. Neither company has disclosed full tallies yet.<br />The two widely held stocks add to a growing list of big U.S. companies that have failed to garner shareholder support for their executive compensation plans this year. Such advisory votes are nonbinding and rarely fail to win overwhelming shareholder support; but some institutional investors have used them this year to also voice their displeasure with  Starbucks Corp.  and  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.,  among others.<br />The executives at GE and AT&T received special stock awards in 2020 that made them among the highest-paid business leaders last year, a difficult period when the pandemic disrupted business, tested managers and cost millions of Americans their jobs. The median CEO received compensation of $13.7 million in 2020, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis in April.<br />Asset manager Allianz Global Investors said its stewardship committee decided to vote down AT&T’s executive compensation plan. “This rationale takes into account multiple one-off decisions by the compensation committee raising concerns around performance linkage,” an Allianz spokeswoman said, adding that long-term incentive payments “enabling payouts for performance that is inferior to peers” also contributed to the decision.</td>

      <td>A Discovery+ miniseries tells the story of actor Tom Arnold’s sister, who profited handsomely from introducing methamphetamines to Iowa.</td>
      <td>Lori Arnold drives a forklift now, but she used to be a “queenpin.” The “Scarface in a Skirt” of screaming tabloids headlines. The woman who, on a grand scale, introduced methamphetamines to Iowa. She is, to a great extent, a fascinating story.<br />But if viewers find themselves conflicted while watching this Discovery+ miniseries, it won’t be surprising. “Queen of Meth” is, in many ways, a cautionary tale, the story of a drug-abuse epidemic brought on by a number of factors, including the disastrous strikes against Hormel’s meatpacking plants in the mid-’80s (and the closing of the Hormel plant in Arnold’s hometown of Ottumwa, Iowa). What ensued was a convergence of financial need and idleness that led a farming state into a whirlwind of meth addiction. As the joke went, Iowa came to stand for “I Only Want Amphetamines.”<br />It was a situation cultivated in no small way by Arnold, who was making bushel baskets of cash and at one point spending it ostentatiously. “Why don’t you get a vanity plate that says ‘BUST ME’?” one local remembers saying to Arnold about her red Jaguar. It would, indeed, all come tumbling down in 1991 for Arnold, who spends a great deal of time and energy mapping out how one becomes a drug lord, a process that resembles a kind of falling forward into deeper and deeper involvement with criminals. And, of course, being one.<br />“I’m more embarrassed about my past than I used to be,” Arnold admits. Embarrassment may not be exactly what a viewer will experience, but a three-part presentation about Arnold seems like two parts too much. Much energy is devoted to the Arnold family chronicle: Lori Arnold’s brother is Tom Arnold, the actor-comedian and onetime husband and co-star of Roseanne Barr. He appears throughout “Queen of Meth” as a guide, translator, historian and apologist. Their mother, who more or less abandoned them, is blamed for most of Lori’s problems, which included a marriage at age 14 and exposure at an early age to those dens of Midwestern iniquity, the skating rink and the Elks club. Mr. Arnold is a mostly sympathetic element in the show and has acknowledged his own problems with substance abuse. But when he employs the “addiction is a disease” rhetoric in regard to his sister it feels very false. She was intoxicated by the money, never mind the cost.</td>

      <td>House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy questions whether the Wyoming lawmaker can carry out her job in leadership</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said he had concerns about Rep. Liz Cheney’s ability to serve as one of the party’s top leaders, signaling ebbing support for the prominent critic of former President Donald Trump to remain in her post.<br />“I have heard from members concerned about her ability to carry out the job as conference chair—to carry out the message,” Mr. McCarthy said Tuesday on Fox News. “We all need to be working as one if we’re able to win the majority.”<br />A spokesman for Ms. Cheney, the GOP conference chairwoman, said in response, “This is about whether the Republican Party is going to perpetuate lies about the 2020 election and attempt to whitewash what happened on Jan. 6. Liz will not do that. That is the issue.”<br />Adding more tension to the relationship, Axios reported Tuesday afternoon on comments purportedly made to Fox News hosts before the segment started. According to audio of the remarks, Mr. McCarthy said: “I think she’s got real problems. I’ve had it with her. You know, I’ve lost confidence.” Mr. McCarthy’s office declined to confirm the remarks.<br />Ms. Cheney, who represents Wyoming, has urged the party to distance itself from the former president over his remarks and behavior related to his baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, while Mr. McCarthy has emphasized unity, including with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump was impeached by the House in January over allegations he incited the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol by his supporters. He was acquitted in the Senate.</td>

      <td>In a Peacock comedy produced by Tina Fey, Sara Bareilles and more play the now-middle-aged members of a ’90s girl group that reunites.</td>
      <td>The people I live with were startled the other day by a sound they’d never heard, and which showed no signs of stopping. “What’s happening?!” they cried in alarm. It was me, under headphones, watching “Girls5eva” and roaring with laughter. “I’m sorry,” I said. I was lying.<br />Created by the veteran comedy writer Meredith Scardino, “Girls5eva” (“because 4eva’s too short,” says the signature lyric) is about a one-hit-wonder pop group that decides to make a last-ditch lunge at stardom. The let’s-get-the-band-back-together trope is ubiquitous, but the eight-episode series is about a lot of other things, too, including the question of whether mere middle-aged contentment can be enough when you’ve actually tasted celebrity. The spotlight may be irresistible, but so is the cast of “Girls5eva,” an all-star lineup of Broadway veterans, songwriting talents, killer comedy sidekicks and people as likable as they are funny.<br />The members of Girls5eva, who now number four (“Ashley lost her battle with the infinity pool,” someone laments) were basically ripped off as young performers and never really got to enjoy the little fame they had. They now lead lives of unquiet, comedic desperation. Dawn (singer/actress Sara Bareilles) lives in Queens with her young son and husband, Scott (Daniel Breaker), and works in a corner Italian restaurant owned by her maniacal brother (a devilish Dean Winters, the “mayhem” guy in the Allstate ads). Gloria (Paula Pell) became a dentist and half of the first New York lesbian couple to get divorced. Wickie (Renée Elise Goldsberry of “Hamilton,” among other things) maintains an Insta-glamorous public image but actually works shooting geese at the airport. Summer (Busy Philipps) is married to a former boy-band star named Kev (Andrew Rannells of “Girls”), whom she seldom sees and for reasons that become pretty obvious. Her marriage is just one of the fictions that keep the gloriously ditzy Summer going.<br />The bandmates haven’t been in touch for years—they were thrown together by management to begin with, à la the Spice Girls. But when a rapper known as Lil Stinker (Jeremiah Craft) samples Girls5eva’s biggest single on his latest release, they’re asked to appear with him on a late-night talk show and the reception is so great they decide they’ll go on tour with Stinker. He takes a pass. “Y’all remind me that this might not last forever,” says the contemplative Stinker. “That fame is, in its essence, transient.” Don’t they know it.<br />Their old manager, Larry Plumb (Jonathan Hardary), whose crimes of copyright are revealed over time, puts it even more bluntly: “They reunited ‘Saved by the Bell,’ ‘Kenan & Kel’ and everyone from Iran-Contra,” he says. “For ladies, 35 is checkout time!”</td>

Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans in Manhattan.<br />The debate, hosted by NY1, was recorded in advance of Tuesday night, with a format that included brief opening statements before candidates answered questions posed by moderator Errol Lewis. The candidates were also able to ask questions of their opponents during one portion of the evening.<br />Though the candidates have participated in numerous candidate forums, all held virtually, the debate marks a potential moment that could influence the outcome of the race.</td>

Prosecutors allege that she and former Chief Operating Officer Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani deceived investors and patients by promising the company’s blood-testing technology could do more than it actually could.<br />Attorneys for Ms. Holmes argued Tuesday that the U.S. attorney’s office for the Northern District of California had built a sweeping case on anecdotal evidence and urged a federal judge to restrict what prosecutors could present to a jury at a trial scheduled to begin in late August.<br />“This trial is going to be a sprawling mess of irrelevant, prejudicial evidence,” Amy Saharia, a Williams & Connolly LLP partner representing Ms. Holmes, said in court.<br />Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bostic countered that the case wasn’t overly broad and that the indictment alleged Ms. Holmes “defrauded patients by saying tests were accurate and reliable when they weren’t—and she knew it.”</td>

Federal prison officials recently reached out to the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted the former Democratic lawmaker, about releasing him to home confinement, an office spokesman said.<br />The spokesman said prosecutors told the federal Bureau of Prisons on Monday that they opposed home confinement for Mr. Silver. A spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons said it wouldn’t discuss an individual inmate’s release plans, but that the bureau had the authority to furlough inmates to their homes while they are considered for home or community confinement.<br />Mr. Silver, who has a home in Manhattan’s Lower East Side, couldn’t be reached for comment, and his attorney, James Loonam, declined to comment. Before he was sentenced in July, Mr. Silver said he was sorry for his actions and said he didn’t wish to die in prison. His lawyers said in court papers that Mr. Silver had a history of kidney disease and cancer.<br />Mr. Silver was one of the most powerful politicians in New York and served more than 20 years as speaker of the Assembly before he was charged in 2015 with trading official favors for bribes disguised as legal fees.</td>

      <td>Justices examine relevance of First Step Act to an earlier conviction; Biden administration backs inmate, reversing Trump position</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court appeared unlikely after Tuesday arguments to extend leniency to a career criminal under the First Step Act, despite the Biden administration’s last-minute decision to back the inmate’s claim that the 2018 criminal-justice overhaul applies to his crack-cocaine offense.<br />Reducing penalties for drug offenses has attracted bipartisan agreement, with widespread acknowledgment that punishment for crack cocaine, a drug lawmakers associated with African-Americans, has been disproportionately severe.<br />The issue Tuesday wasn’t one of policy, however. Rather, the court sought to make sense of complex provisions of the First Step Act, a predecessor 2010 law called the Fair Sentencing Act and federal sentencing guidelines that calibrate punishment based on factors including the amount of drugs in possession and a defendant’s prior criminal record.<br />“Look, the [penalty] ratio between crack and ordinary cocaine was ridiculous, 100 to 1 or something,” said Justice Stephen Breyer. “So Congress finally got around to modifying that. Fine. And anybody who had been sentenced under the old range, go back and get resentenced. Fine.”<br />The problem, he said, was that the section in dispute “seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with that ratio.” To read it in the defendant’s favor, he said, could permit nearly every federal offender to seek resentencing, something far beyond the First Step Act’s scope.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration said it would begin reallocating some Covid-19 vaccine doses to states with higher demand for shots and direct pharmacies to offer walk-in vaccinations, as the president aims to get 70% of the adult population at least one dose by July 4.<br />President Biden said Tuesday he also wants 160 million U.S. adults to have the full course of the vaccine by that point, which he said would mean administering about 100 million shots over the next 60 days. The U.S. administered about 220 million shots in Mr. Biden’s first 100 days, but the pace of vaccinations has fallen in recent weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly 56% of U.S. adults had received at least one dose as of Monday, according to the CDC.<br />“The light at the end of the tunnel is actually growing brighter and brighter,” Mr. Biden said.<br />“We need you to bring it home,” he said. “Get vaccinated. In two months, let’s celebrate our independence as a nation, and our independence from this virus.”<br />The new goals are part of the next phase of the Biden administration’s vaccination campaign, which will focus on addressing vaccine hesitancy and eliminating barriers that make it difficult for some Americans to access the shots. The administration is also preparing to distribute shots to adolescents.</td>

But at home he is under pressure to bring France in line with the European Union’s plan to achieve the bloc’s Paris accord commitment: a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 1990.<br />Mr. Macron in 2019 backed off a plan to raise carbon taxes on energy after the idea sparked the antiestablishment yellow vest movement. That threw off France’s plans to hit its EU commitment on emissions.<br />“The yellow vest movement reminded us how crucial public acceptance is,” Marie Lebec, a lawmaker from Mr. Macron’s party, said Tuesday. “There is a middle way between those for whom nothing is good enough and those who don’t want to do anything.”<br />Tuesday’s bill must be reconciled with a text that has yet to pass the French Senate before it can become law.</td>

      <td>It’s a real gas being an incumbent in this business.<br />Cheniere Energy ,  the largest exporter of U.S. liquefied natural gas, had a great first quarter and can look forward to many more. Revenue increased 14% from a year earlier—higher than the 4% growth analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected. Net income increased 5%, a much better result than the 42% decline analysts had penciled in.<br />The East Asian LNG spot price benchmark, the Japan/Korea Marker, spiked to a record $32.50 per million British thermal units in mid-January—six times what it was a year earlier—buoyed by cold weather and a tighter shipping market. That helped boost Cheniere’s margins. Though more than 80% of Cheniere’s export capacity is sold through long-term contracts, the company is able to capitalize on shorter-term spikes through its uncontracted capacity.<br />Pricing dynamics are favorable for U.S. exports at the moment: Brent crude is approaching $70 a barrel even as the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub natural gas prices remain below $3 per million British thermal units. Higher oil prices tend to make American LNG more competitive because it is sold under Henry Hub-indexed prices rather than oil-indexed pricing used elsewhere.<br />After a year of shrinking demand growth, the global LNG supply-demand balance looks tight for 2021, according to Samer Mosis, team lead for Europe, Middle East and Africa LNG analytics at S&P Global Platts. It is expected to continue tightening until 2024-2025 because of a lack of new supply growth.</td>

Psychologists call this “post-traumatic growth.”<br />Endurance athletes, who typically prevail through extreme emotional as well as physical challenges, often experience a type of post-traumatic growth. Through years of training and experience, they build an increased sense of personal strength.

      <td>Lack a plot in which to nurture a dreamy profusion of plants and flowers? Dig into container gardening, no land required.</td>
      <td>LIKE A BOTANICAL King Midas, Alexander Hoyle turns lifeless pavement into cottage gardens worthy of bucolic Britain. You can barely tell that the fairy-tale patch in front of the garden designer’s own London apartment—a profusion that includes foxglove and iris—isn’t a patch at all but a group of plantings set atop a mostly flagstone surface (right). The transformative ingredient: containers. Mr. Hoyle fills flower pots with several species, he said, then sets the containers cheek by jowl “to embody the English country garden…romantic, abundant and very floriferous.”<br />Mr. Hoyle and other garden designers challenge the notion that vibrant, pollinator-friendly flower gardens require a country estate. City balconies, sidewalks and rooftops can be home to decidedly un-urban styles of garden via container gardening, a method that offers some unanticipated advantages.<br />Jessica Smith, a floral designer and gardener in Bath, England, created her doorstep cutting-garden with containers during the 2020 lockdown. She had originally grown the seedlings on windowsills in a bid to supply her own wedding flowers (the ceremony was scuttled by the pandemic).<br />“Growing in containers meant that I could place my plants very closely together for an abundant and wild look with no gaps,” she said. This would be trickier in a traditional flower border, she added. “Plants need space for their roots and can’t compete well for water and nutrients. But in containers, each plant can be watered and fed individually and placed for maximum impact without [compromising] their needs.” Ms. Smith was able to nurture water-needy climbing roses alongside drought-tolerant cosmos, for example. Containers also let you position plants requiring different soil types—acidic versus alkaline, loamy versus sandy—beside each other. “It was a liberating way of planting,” she said.<br />Container gardeners use planters to play with height in ways not possible when you’re planting in the ground. For example, you can elevate smaller, lower-growing flowers such as calendula, also known as pot marigold, and place them anywhere in a display, said Ms. Smith. You can fashion improbable plant-scapes using different-sized pots; containers raised on bricks concealed by pots in front; and teepees made of willow or bamboo for climbers such as sweet peas.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Justice Department needs more money to fight domestic terrorism, bolster enforcement of civil-rights law, combat gun violence and promote other Biden administration priorities, Attorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers Tuesday in his first congressional appearance since his confirmation.<br />Mr. Garland outlined the department’s $35.2 billion budget request for the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the Justice Department. The request is an 11% increase from the previous fiscal year, substantially larger than those the agency has requested in recent years. During the Trump administration, the Justice Department requested more modest budget increases each year. Congress ultimately sets the Justice Department’s funding.<br />The request reflects priorities Mr. Garland has already begun enacting. Federal prosecutors are pursuing more than 400 cases in connection to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, and Mr. Garland has said thwarting extremist violence is a top concern. The Biden Justice Department has also taken a more active role in monitoring local police, announcing sweeping investigations into police departments in Minneapolis and Louisville, Ky., where high-profile police killings of Black people sparked nationwide protests and bipartisan calls for change.<br />The priorities Mr. Garland highlighted mark a shift from those of the Trump administration, which sought more money to fight street crime and gang violence and took a more hands-off approach toward local police practices.<br />The budget request calls for a $33 million increase in funding for the department’s Civil Rights Division to enforce federal voting-rights statutes, investigate local police departments and prosecute hate crimes, all work Mr. Garland called “critical to protecting the American dream.” The attorney general said that amounted to a 18.6% increase over current funding for the division.</td>

Bordo’s “The Fed in the Sand as Inflation Threatens” (op-ed, April 27): I have been calling on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to release his plan to curb the effects of inflation for several months. Last month, I finally heard back from him. He told me that he doesn’t want inflation that substantially exceeds 2%, or inflation for a prolonged period.<br />I agree. The problem for Mr. Powell is that Messrs. Lewis and Bordo are precisely right: Inflation rates above 2% for any period will disproportionately hurt low-income families, like mine growing up. I watched my parents struggle to make ends meet month after month. If the cost of gas and groceries were also increasing at the rates they currently are, I’m not sure what we would have done.<br />According to data from FactSet, 47 S&P companies have mentioned inflation on their earnings calls for Q1 2021—more than during any other quarter in the last 10 years.<br />I ran for public office because I want every American to have the same opportunity I did to live the dream of this country. Mr. Powell’s indifference toward rising costs of gas, groceries, and diapers is wrong and hurts our nation’s poorest families the most.<br />There must be a clear plan to address rising inflation. Fiscal policy makers should be transparent with American families and offer solutions to those who may be hurt by their decisions. Eighty-seven percent of Americans are already concerned about the rising costs of everyday goods. Mr. Powell needs to get real about inflation and stop brushing off this serious issue as “temporary” pain.</td>

Hyman Rickover: “There are two types of ships: submarines and targets.” Given the ubiquity of satellite surveillance, secrecy is an anachronism. The assorted missile arrays poised to take out a carrier task force make an entire fleet into a veritable floating Pearl Harbor. Positioning a fleet between Taiwan and China invites an incident with limitless potential for escalation. Were even one ship to be sunk by China, what then would our retaliatory strike provoke? As Adm. Rickover warned: “Unfortunately . . . attempts to limit war have always failed. The lesson of history is when a war starts every nation will ultimately use whatever weapon it has available.” A surface Navy in the context of nuclear-armed belligerents is as antiquated as the canvas sail.<br />Lt. Cdr. Jeffrey R. Smith (USN, Ret.)<br />Alameda, Calif.<br /><br />Much of China’s military development and its potential threat to the U.S. is being financed with American money. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative says that in 2019 the U.S. spent $471.8 billion on imports from China while our exports were $163 billion. In addition, U.S. foreign direct investment in China was $116.2 billion and the reciprocal was $37.7 billion. In an economy like China’s, those dollars can be directed wherever the regime chooses. Our national strategy requires a more expansive effort than simply increasing the defense budget. We cannot win an arms race in which we finance both sides.</td>

      <td>Ferrari  investors may have gotten too used to smooth driving.<br />The luxury sports-car maker isn’t pulling away from the challenges posed by the pandemic quite as effortlessly as some were hoping. Its shares fell 7% in New York Tuesday after the company said it would hit its 2022 financial targets a year late due to Covid-19. Ferrari delayed some spending last year; now it has worked through its delivery schedule enough to expect a knock-on impact on profits next year.<br />The selloff highlights just how high the stakes are when a stock fetches more than 40 times prospective earnings. If investors are spooked by some relatively minor post-pandemic grinding of gears, they may not be properly prepared for Ferrari’s move into the electric age—a process fraught with much greater risks for a brand based on engine noise.<br />Chairman John Elkann said last month that Ferrari would launch its first all-electric vehicle in 2025, for the first time putting a timeline on the company’s EV efforts. While the car could be an opportunity to win new customers with a more digital notion of automotive tech, Ferrari will need to find a distinctive approach that chimes with its powertrain-centric heritage.<br />The company has already built up some experience with batteries, having started deliveries late last year of its first plug-in hybrid, the SF90 Stradale. But taking the internal combustion engine out of vehicles is an altogether bigger challenge. Apart from the question of engine sound, it will be hard for Ferrari to claim leadership in battery and software engineering in the way it can with engines and mechanical engineering. Most likely the company will continue to make plug-in hybrids—often seen as a transitional technology—well into the future.</td>

      <td>During Yellen’s tenure and Powell’s, no governor has cast a dissenting vote on monetary policy.</td>
      <td>In the aftermath of an economic and financial challenge that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently likened to Dunkirk—the urgent rescue of British and other Allied troops from France in World War II—there’s a remarkable uniformity of opinion on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Apparently, they all agree on the appropriateness of the Fed’s monetary-policy decisions. That’s what worries me.<br />While it might seem reassuring when members of an institution concur, the Fed’s tendency toward groupthink carries the risk of missing other important perspectives. Forging a consensus can mean trimming the edges of troubling concerns over future developments.<br />For example, even as financial markets signal uneasiness about the effect of inflationary pressures, Mr. Powell has maintained steadfastly that the Fed will be “patient” in keeping interest rates near zero through 2023. He also promises the central bank will continue purchasing at least $120 billion of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities every month (adding $1.44 trillion annually to the Fed’s balance sheet) until “we’ve made substantial further progress toward our goals.”<br />Echoing this commitment to easy-money policies stretching well ahead, Fed Gov. Lael Brainard’s speech in March to the National Association for Business Economics was titled “Remaining Patient as the Outlook Brightens.”<br />Is such sanguinity reassuring? Granted, under the emergency conditions imposed last spring by the coronavirus pandemic, strong disagreement on the Fed board over internal policy decisions wouldn’t have been helpful. It was critical for the central bank to project confidence and resolution in carrying out its function as lender of last resort.</td>

Globally, there are more than 900,000 new cases and 13,000 deaths a day. The U.S. should immediately begin exporting Covid vaccines, not only to help others but also to prevent future outbreaks at home.<br />It is laudatory that the U.S. is donating $4 billion to Covax to buy vaccine for low- and middle-income countries and working to assist countries in setting up vaccine production facilities. But these efforts won’t save lives today. It takes the better part of a year to build and work out the kinks of a vaccine-production facility, and tight supply chains will make it hard for other countries to manufacture large volumes.<br />Even the 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine President Biden has pledged will take weeks to deliver. Only 10 million have been produced, and they need weeks of testing since they were produced in the troubled Baltimore Emergent factory. The other 50 million doses won’t be manufactured and available for months.<br />The U.S. needs to begin exporting  Pfizer ,  Moderna and  Johnson & Johnson  vaccines in the next few days. While the formal export ban expired at the end of March, the U.S. government still has contracts requiring delivery of tens of millions of doses. Washington also has leverage over vaccine exports because of a complex relationship between pharmaceutical companies and the government that includes the U.S. position on waiving patent rights on the vaccines at the World Trade Organization, Food and Drug Administration approval of the vaccines, and the Defense Production Act, which is integral to optimizing supply chains for vaccine production.<br />The domestic Covid vaccine supply now exceeds demand. Some pharmacies are administering shots on a walk-in basis, and the mass-vaccination site at Philadelphia’s convention center went from giving 7,000 shots a day to a few hundred. Four thousand doses there were recently set to expire because of slack demand.</td>

      <td>Investors are pricing the rental-car company like a long-term luxury</td>
      <td>Avis Budget Group  is coming off what Chief Executive Joseph Ferraro called the most difficult year in its history. Meanwhile, shares of the company are up more than 530% over the past 12 months.<br />That kind of discrepancy is only justified if the rental-car industry is undergoing a structural shift from a commoditized afterthought to a more valued staple in consumers’ travel plans. Facts—past and present—suggest otherwise.<br />Like other rental-car companies,  Avis Budget  spent the pandemic unloading a large percentage of its fleet to cut costs and boost profitability amid tanking demand. In February, Avis Budget said it ultimately removed 31% of its fleet due to the pandemic. And on Monday, the company said its Americas business logged its best margin on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the company’s history, even while global revenue was down 22% year over year.<br />Investors now have to consider the sustainability of those margins, which have been boosted to a large extent by industrywide price increases. Avis Budget said revenue per day was up 12% in the Americas in the first quarter, and that those favorable pricing dynamics have largely continued into the second quarter. For now, a shortage of available rental vehicles, coupled with pent-up demand for travel, have consumers paying up. In March, the cheapest rental car in Maui ran more than $700 a day, according to a report last month from Hawaii News Now.<br />Will demand continue to support significant price increases in the longer term, though? Avis Budget noted on Tuesday that rental-car pricing in the Americas didn’t appreciate at all from 2010 to 2019, even while average prices for airfare and hotels increased significantly. But there is likely a reason for this. There have always been myriad rental-car companies at major airports, where a large percentage of the industry’s business is transacted. Meanwhile, alternatives such as ride-sharing and public transport may have been less attractive during the pandemic, but they are likely to log increased utilization as case rates subside. Wall Street analysts expect Avis Budget’s adjusted Ebitda to peak in the third quarter of this year, but grow less than 5% in the fourth quarter from the same period of 2019.</td>

      <td>The nylon shorts, a brand mainstay since 1982, are growing increasingly popular with a younger generation. If you can’t wait for a restock, try these modern-day options.</td>
      <td>A FEW WEEKS ago Bryan Koehler, a full-time clothing reseller in Houston, struck gold at his local Goodwill. Mr. Koehler, 26, chanced upon a stash of nearly 50 pairs of Patagonia Baggies, recycled-nylon shorts that come in a kaleidoscope of colors from fluorescent lemon to pine green to solid black. He snatched them up for $5 a pair and, within 48 hours, had sold 40 pairs on the resale site  Poshmark  at around $40 each. When asked to explain this rapid-fire resale bonanza, he credited the “following” Baggies shorts have attracted. “People are willing to pay [for them],” he said.<br />These culty shorts—which come in men’s and women’s cuts and retail new for $55—have been a Patagonia mainstay since 1982, but what made Mr. Koehler’s score particularly valuable is that Baggies can be devilishly hard to find. When summer rolls around, Baggies in colors like purple, “Bayou Blue” (a bright blue) and mango sell out steadily in nearly all sizes.<br />This year, Patagonia has introduced a new color, “Jellyfish Yellow,” a soft, almost greenish tint which instantly triggered demand among collectors (yes, there are Baggies collectors). “Just to see Patagonia release a new colorway, it gets people excited,” said Middlesbrough, England-based Daniel Eaton, 30, who runs Way Out Cache, an online vintage-outdoor-wear resale store that peddles old Patagonia shorts.<br />Mr. Eaton, like many Baggies connoisseurs, credits the shorts’ shape as the key to their allure. They have a breezy, well-off-the-leg cut and nipped, gam-flashing length—with inseams as short as 5 inches for men and 2.5 for women. A spring 1991 catalog described the fit as “the perfect cross between traditional rugby shorts and swim trunks.” Yes, you can swim in Baggies, too. Since the early ’80s, the style has largely gone unfussed with. Mr. Koehler noted that the immodest silhouette of the 5-inch Baggies was more or less the same one his dad favored when he was in his 20s back in the ’80s. “That style is coming back,” he said, gaining currency with a younger generation thanks in part to brazen TikTok and Instagram users who flaunt their Baggies in posts.<br />That only makes Baggies harder to track down. For years, Jumaane Bennett, 29, a mail handler in East Hartford, Conn., has been amassing Baggies—which he calls “the best of both worlds”—halfway between a swishy basketball short and a clean everyday one. He now has roughly 20 pairs. Yet Mr. Bennett said the style is getting harder to find and he’s taken to nabbing Baggies on resale sites. If you’d rather forego the secondhand route but simply can’t wait for a restock, here are three Baggies dupes that might not be cultish, but will get you that nostalgic, thigh-flaunting look for summer.</td>

      <td>AUSTIN, Texas—A group of major companies and business organizations came out Tuesday against a Texas voting bill, after debating how aggressively they should be involved in state legislation.<br />Nearly 50 companies, including  Microsoft Corp. ,  Unilever  PLC and  American Airlines Group Inc.,  signed a letter opposing “any changes that would restrict eligible voters’ access to the ballot” in Texas, days ahead of an expected vote in the state legislature on a voting bill.<br />As state legislatures consider new voting access bills, companies in Texas and elsewhere have grappled with how much to weigh in, amid pressure from employees and civil-rights organizations and pushback from Republicans lawmakers. After Georgia legislators added vote-by-mail identification requirements and limited drop boxes, companies including  Delta Air Lines Inc.  and Coca-Cola Co. lodged public opposition.<br />The business community in Texas has been divided in recent weeks over how strongly to come out against the imminent legislation. Signatories of Tuesday’s letter preferred not to name any specific bills because there are several and because they wanted to avoid direct lobbying, said people familiar with the matter. A fight over how strongly to oppose the bills, meanwhile, broke out among members of the Greater Houston Partnership, the state’s major business association, according to internal documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The group splintered, and some of its members joined more than 175 business executives, lawyers and other prominent Houstonians in signing a letter Tuesday opposing the bills.<br />The statement, signed by leaders of major companies, regional businesses and chambers of commerce, doesn’t address specifics of the several voting bills that are advancing in the Texas Legislature. People involved in drafting the statement said it was intended to oppose them.</td>

Mr. Dimon has in recent weeks said that the massive government stimulus, the widespread vaccine rollout and the actions of his corporate and consumer clients have him believing in a possible “Goldilocks” economy of fast growth coupled with mild inflation.<br />“The boom is good. Employment is good. Growth is good. Everyone should enjoy it,” he said Tuesday. Mr. Dimon was interviewed at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit by Editor in Chief Matt Murray.<br />Still, Mr. Dimon pointed to signs that leave him unsure of the longevity and impact of that boom. Small businesses and lower-income workers suffered disproportionately in the pandemic, he said. Inflation will likely increase. The stock market is priced at historic highs, with pockets of excess.<br />Mr. Dimon also said that government spending aimed at driving economic growth will fall flat if it isn’t designed well, with measurable outcomes. For example, a highway plan should detail how many miles would be built, at what cost and by when, he said. Offering free tuition for community college won’t work if schools aren’t measured by graduation and job placement rates.</td>

Otherwise, no one will be safe,” said Uğur Şahin, BioNTech’s chief executive officer. He said the pandemic would only end when herd immunity is accomplished world-wide.<br />“By mid-2022, even regions with high density populations like India will reach a high rate of vaccination and herd immunity,” Dr. Şahin said. “We will see in the next 12 months an increasing number of industrial, developing and low-income countries reaching this type of herd immunity just by increasing the manufacturing capacity of the currently existing players and adding new manufacturing sites.”<br />Dr. Şahin, who founded the company with his wife, Özlem Türeci, said that they were expanding their manufacturing alliance of more 30 companies in order to produce more vaccines to supply countries such as India.</td>

In 2020, sales of previously owned homes surged to their highest level in 14 years, and many economists forecast sales to rise again this year.<br />But the supply of homes is tight, and new construction can’t keep up with demand—which means that buyers often have to fork over a staggering amount to close a deal. U.S. house prices soared 12.2% in February from a year earlier, the biggest annual increase in data going back to 1991, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency.<br />For millennials who are looking for a home, this means a tough calculation. Many of them have limited funds and are carrying a lot of debt. So, is it worth stretching their resources to buy a more expensive house if they can lock in a lower mortgage rate for years to come?<br />Or should they wait until housing prices cool down to more affordable levels—and risk having mortgage rates rise in the meantime? Already, rates recently hit their highest level since June, and many economists expect them to continue creeping upward this year.</td>

That would keep him in power for at least a few more months as he defends himself in a corruption trial that began in May 2020 and could drag on for years. He denies any wrongdoing.<br />“His dream right now is to keep going.

Over the course of the full year, Pfizer now expects the vaccine to generate $26 billion in sales. It had previously forecast $15 billion in sales from the vaccine.<br />Rising vaccine sales joined better results across the company’s portfolio of drugs to boost Pfizer’s revenue overall. Total revenue for the first quarter came in at $14.58 billion, climbing 45% year over year. Stripped of one-time items, Pfizer’s adjusted profit in the quarter was 93 cents a share.<br />Analysts surveyed by FactSet had been forecasting an adjusted profit of 78 cents a share on sales of $13.62 billion.<br />Apart from the company’s success with its Covid-19 vaccine—a two-dose shot that it developed with  BioNTech SE —sales also rose in Pfizer’s divisions for oncology, internal medicine and hospital products, along with sales of other drugs in its portfolio. Sales for Eliquis, an anticoagulant, rose 25% operationally year over year, while Vyndaqel, used to treat heart failure, saw revenue improve 88% operationally year over year.</td>

      <td>Four years after 2017 tax law, lawmakers and economists still disagree over workers’ and shareholders’ relative burdens</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden is seeking about $2 trillion in higher taxes on companies over 15 years to pay for his infrastructure plan. But corporations are just entities composed of people, so if corporate taxes go up, who ultimately pays?<br />The Biden administration says the greater tax burden would fall largely on high-income shareholders of profitable companies that wouldn’t reduce investments even if taxes rose. That view makes the corporate tax a useful tool for redistributing income and taxing people the U.S. individual-income tax can’t always reach.<br />The reasoning is that a company would react to a decline in after-tax profit by reducing payouts to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. The company’s share price could also be lower than it otherwise would be, hurting shareholders.<br />“In the short run, it’s just shareholders, shareholders, shareholders,” said Steve Rosenthal of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, who described Republicans’ 2017 corporate tax cuts as an enormous giveaway to foreign investors. “The corporate tax is like the best way to collect revenue from foreigners and rich guys,” he said.<br />A completely different perspective animated that law. Republicans, who controlled Congress and the White House, said workers would gain as corporate taxes declined. The idea was that those cuts would spur investment and make employees more productive and able to claim higher wages. In that view, Mr. Biden’s infrastructure spending to help workers would be funded by workers themselves.</td>

They are offering these workers a nearby alternative: furnished office space, bookable by the day or month and within walking distance from home.<br />One of those companies is Daybase, a New York-based startup founded by the former WeWork executives Joel Steinhaus and Doug Chambers. It is launching this week and plans to open its first locations in Northern New Jersey, this year, eyeing suburban towns like Hoboken and Montclair.<br />A proliferation of new suburban office spaces could help fill empty retail space. They could also further blur the distinction between residential and commercial neighborhoods and help remake metropolitan areas.<br />Today, most cities are built around central business districts designed for commuters. But some urban planners suggest cities could become more decentralized, with more and smaller offices throughout the suburbs. That would allow more people to work and shop without ever having to commute far.</td>

The sticks, complain some investors, don’t leave much of a mark.<br />Since last summer, companies have issued nearly $240 billion of debt with special rules that reward them with lower borrowing costs—or penalize them with higher ones—depending on if they meet self-made targets for things such as cutting carbon emissions, or for getting more women on boards, according to Dealogic. That nearly doubles the total issuance of such debt over the previous three years.<br />Lenders have long put ratchets on loans or step-ups on bonds that cause interest rates to change depending on a company’s financial performance. But the idea of tying interest costs to nonfinancial risks, such as reducing carbon emissions, or improving governance, is relatively novel.<br />The surge in bonds and loans tied to environmental, social and governance performance, known in industry parlance as ESG, is meeting a huge demand from investors for such investment products.<br />Fund managers like them because they qualify for ESG-labeled funds that they can sell on to investors. One irony of ratchet loans, is that the investors get paid more if the companies fail to meet their objectives. This is meant to compensate investors because a borrower that misses governance targets is a riskier prospect.</td>

      <td>Canadian National’s higher bid for Kansas City Southern gives it upper hand, but exposes it to broad financial risk if approval falls through</td>
      <td>The scrap between two Canadian railroads for  Kansas City Southern  is getting ugly. It could also get very expensive.<br />Canadian Pacific  and  Canadian National  have released letters from stakeholders in support of their competing offers for the U.S. carrier or disparaging rival bids. Canadian Pacific, which moved first and agreed to pay $25 billion, or $275 a KCS share, called its domestic rival’s higher bid inferior because it “creates adverse competitive impacts.”<br />Canadian National, whose $325-a-share bid combining cash and stock was valued at $33.7 billion when announced but is worth somewhat less now, disagrees and has taken a riskier tack. Canadian Pacific asked for and received a waiver from more stringent rules enacted by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board in 2001 governing rail mergers. Canadian National, which is larger, hasn’t asked for a waiver and could face a longer, tougher approval process potentially extending to the end of 2022. The not-so-new rules have never been applied to a major merger.<br />Before either company’s bid is approved, though, Kansas City Southern would be taken over by a voting trust created by the winning bidder. The U.S. railroad’s shareholders would be paid regardless. The combined company would still be one of the smallest Class 1 railroads in North America under either scenario and would be the most expensive large rail acquisition of the current era in terms of earnings multiple.<br />Taken at face value, both offers seem economically justified given the limited consolidation moves left on the table. Railroads are natural monopolies that can’t be replicated, and connecting Canada, Mexico and the U.S. has serious value. If Canadian National is chosen by Kansas City Southern’s board, then it says it can extract at least $1 billion a year in pretax synergies and it probably would win business from truckers and other railroads. But it could face a significant financial hit if the deal later fails to gain approval or even if significant concessions such as trackage rights or disposals are required.</td>

      <td>Lenders awash in cheap funding face no credit issues for now, but that might not last</td>
      <td>Things are very good for consumer lenders right now. Maybe too good.<br />Shares of lenders including credit-card, auto, student and personal loan makers have soared this year, thanks to strong credit performance and a belief that rates will tick higher. For many of these stocks it isn’t hard to envision further gains as part of a broad recovery in consumer spending and credit demand. Firms such as  Ally Financial ,   Capital One Financial ,   LendingClub  and  SLM  all are up more than 40% so far this year, or roughly double the gain for S&P 500 financials overall.<br />Early worries of credit woes stemming from the pandemic haven’t materialized. But investors also now have reason to be cautious on the longer-term outlook, as the current lending boom could create conditions for higher defaults eventually. Capital One’s longtime Chief Executive Richard Fairbank last week offered some “pattern recognition” on what he called the physics of credit markets. “This period of unusually strong credit could lay the groundwork for credit worsening down the road, as an industry point,” Mr. Fairbank said.<br />One risk is that consumers may appear more creditworthy only temporarily, boosted by stimulus, forbearance of other debts such as student loans or mortgage payments, and high collateral values for things like used vehicles. That, paired with lenders’ excess liquidity driven by a flood of deposits, could “push lenders to stretch for less-resilient business,” Mr. Fairbank said.<br />Auto lending seems like one potential area for excess. Mr. Fairbank noted that auto-loan competition can be especially fierce because dealers often actively make lenders bid against each other. Executives at Santander Consumer told analysts last week that competition “has returned and is more intense in some respects than pre-Covid times.”</td>

      <td>MediaTek has fared well during the chip shortage and its stock has skyrocketed</td>
      <td>The technological rivalry between China and the U.S. has drawn attention to the world’s chip factory,  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  Another semiconductor company on the island has also thrived as tensions have escalated.<br />Chip designer  MediaTek  is on a roll: Its shares have more than doubled since the beginning of last year and it’s now Taiwan’s second largest company with a market value of $62 billion. The company makes mobile application processors, which integrate multiple components into a single chipset—akin to the brain for a smartphone. According to Counterpoint Research, MediaTek overtook  Qualcomm  to become the largest maker of mobile chipsets last year, a title it will probably retain this year. Like Qualcomm, MediaTek is a fabless chip firm: It designs chips that are then manufactured by contract chip makers like TSMC. MediaTek’s more affordable chipsets have won market share in mid- to low-end markets. Qualcomm still leads in 5G chipsets, but MediaTek is also catching up fast there too. The company’s revenue grew 78% year over year to a record high last quarter, outpacing Qualcomm, and it expects further gains this quarter.<br />The U.S. sanctions on Huawei have helped MediaTek too. Many Huawei smartphones, especially the high-end ones, use chipsets designed by its own HiSilicon unit. But since U.S. sanctions have crippled Huawei, its market share has been gobbled up by its Chinese smartphone rivals, which are big customers of MediaTek. Chinese smartphone makers Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo represented 35% of global smartphone shipments last quarter, compared with 28% a year earlier, according to industry researcher IDC. New orders for MediaTek’s Dimensity chipsets from these smartphone makers have more than offset lost revenue from Huawei—another echo of TSMC, which shrugged off lost revenue from Huawei last year as orders from Huawei’s rivals surged.<br />There are some temporary factors that have aided MediaTek’s rise. The shutdown of  Samsung ’s  manufacturing plant in Austin, Texas, earlier this year due to winter storms disrupted Qualcomm’s business, which relies on the facility for some radio frequency components. The issue will likely ease in the second half this year, according to Counterpoint.<br />But in general, MediaTek has fared well during the chip shortage. It has managed to raise prices as demand jumped: Chinese smartphone makers in particular have increased orders, partly to boost inventories. The switch to 5G has also helped since 5G chipsets have higher prices than 4G ones.  Morgan Stanley  estimates global 5G penetration will reach 47% this year from 18% in 2020.</td>

      <td>Two Republican lawmakers are pressing the attorney general to investigate potential anticompetitive behavior by  Amazon . com Inc. in its pursuit of a major government cloud-computing contract, according to letters reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah) and Rep. Ken Buck (R., Colo.) urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to open up an investigation into the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure procurement process in a joint letter on Monday evening. Amazon was one of a number of technology companies that competed for the Department of Defense’s 10-year, $10 billion cloud-computing contract, but ultimately lost to rival Microsoft Corp.<br />The letter says Amazon might have violated antitrust laws and federal conflict-of-interest laws. “We are concerned that Amazon may have attempted to monopolize one or more markets relating to government and/or commercial cloud computing services by improperly influencing the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure procurement process,” the letter says.<br />Amazon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment late Monday. The company previously has said its cloud subsidiary received no preferential treatment.<br />Amazon has contested the 2019 decision awarding the so-called JEDI contract to Microsoft, its largest cloud-computing rival. Amazon contends that it was treated unfairly in the JEDI procurement process, claiming that former President Donald Trump improperly influenced the outcome and steered the contract to another bidder. The Pentagon has denied those claims.</td>

      <td>More auditors and audits won’t yield much new revenue.</td>
      <td>President Biden says he wants to “revitalize” IRS enforcement to target wealthy Americans who “aggressively plan to avoid the tax laws.” No doubt tax avoiders exist. But a lot less money is likely to be found under the sofa cushions than Mr. Biden and progressives think.<br />The White House is hoping to use this sleight-of-math to help finance its $2 trillion cradle-to-grave entitlement plan. It projects that giving the IRS an extra $80 billion to hunt down tax dodgers will generate $700 billion in revenue over 10 years, citing a National Bureau of Economic Research study that estimates the top 1% of earners fail to pay $175 billion a year in tax they owe.<br />But estimates of the “tax gap”—the difference between what is owed and paid—are based on outdated and incomplete data. The NBER study examines income concealed in foreign bank accounts before Congress, in the 2010 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca), required foreign banks to report foreign assets held by Americans. The IRS has since cracked down on these offshore accounts.<br />The Administration also cites a study from economists Larry Summers and Natasha Sarin that projects that restoring the IRS budget to “historical levels” could generate more than $1 trillion over a decade. Republicans during the Obama Presidency reduced the IRS budget after discovering it was targeting conservative nonprofits. As a result, audit rates over the last decade have fallen across the income spectrum,<br />But the authors probably overstate the effect of IRS staffing on the wealthy. Between fiscal years 2010 and 2019, the amount the IRS dunned taxpayers with reported incomes over $1 million declined by about $4 billion—and about $4 billion for other individuals.</td>

Employees are free to have these conversations on private accounts, but “it can’t happen where the work happens anymore,” said CEO Jason Fried.<br />Talk about “politics, advocacy, or society at large” has become “a major distraction” that is “not healthy” and “hasn’t served us well,” Mr. Fried wrote. Employees “shouldn’t have to wonder if staying out of it means you’re complicit, or wading into it means you’re a target. These are difficult enough waters to navigate in life, but significantly more so at work.”<br />Seems sensible enough. The company offered severance of up to six months’ salary to “those who cannot see a future at Basecamp under this new direction,” said co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson. “No hard feelings, no questions asked.”<br />So much for goodwill. A day later the Verge website ran a hit piece citing unidentified employees making vague allegations that the company wasn’t committed to diversity, equity and inclusion.

Yet new Census voting data show these claims are as meritless as Donald Trump’s that the election was stolen.<br />Census figures released Thursday show that turnout in 2020 reached a near-historic high for a presidential election, with 66.8% of voting-age citizens casting ballots—0.9 percentage-points shy of the 1992 record.<br />Turnout was 5.4 percentage-points higher than in 2016, and 3.2 points higher than in 2008 when Barack Obama drove scores of young people and minorities to the polls. The share of Hispanics (53.7%) and Asians (59.7%) of voting age who cast ballots also hit new peaks. Black voting (62.6%) surpassed any presidential year save 2008 and 2012.<br />Notably, GOP states with stricter voting rules didn’t experience significantly lower minority turnout. Black turnout was highest in Maryland (75.3%) followed by Mississippi (72.8%) and lowest in Massachusetts (36.4%). Liberals have lambasted Georgia for “purging” voters and restricting ballot access. But Georgia had a smaller black-white voting gap than Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia and California—all states controlled by Democrats.<br />The states with the biggest black-white voting gaps? Massachusetts, Oregon, Wisconsin, Iowa and Colorado. Three allow same-day voter registration (Wisconsin, Iowa, and Colorado), according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Good luck trying to discern a link between a state’s voting rules, partisan control and minority turnout.</td>

The Wall Street Journal reported in 2019 that federal officials were examining whether the sportswear maker shifted sales from quarter to quarter to appear healthier.<br />The SEC doesn’t plan to take any enforcement action against Kevin Plank, the company’s co-founder and executive chairman, or Chief Financial Officer David Bergman, Under Armour said in a press release. Under Armour previously disclosed that the two men had been told they could be sued by the SEC.<br />The practice of pulling forward about $408 million in orders happened over six consecutive quarters beginning in the third quarter of 2015, the SEC said. The sales involved orders that customers had requested be shipped in future periods, the SEC said.<br />The regulator alleged the company misled investors by not disclosing a significant portion of its revenue and revenue growth resulted from the practice. The lack of disclosure created “significant uncertainty” about whether Under Armour would meet its revenue guidance in future quarters, the SEC said in a news release.</td>

      <td>Leaders’ greatest failure was not focusing on the elderly, who had lower costs and far greater benefits.</td>
      <td>Now that the Covid-19 pandemic seems to be abating, it’s a good time to look at lessons that observers have, or should have, learned. The list of mistakes is long, but the most glaring was the failure to understand and act on the virus’s propensity to attack the old and vulnerable. Policy makers failed, in other words, to understand the enemy.<br />Some clear thinking based on data that were available last spring would have led to two insights. First, the benefits of protecting the old and vulnerable exceed the costs. Second, the costs of protecting the young and healthy exceed the benefits.<br />For our purposes we are combining voluntary and coercive (e.g., government lockdown) nonpharmaceutical precautions—mask-wearing, hand-washing, quarantining, distancing and isolation of infected people—under the umbrella of protection. The benefits of protection include reducing the potential for death, pain, suffering and healthcare costs, along with reducing the chance of infecting others. But the main benefit of protection is that fewer people die from Covid-19.<br />The infection fatality rate is the probability that a person will die once becoming infected, whether that person has symptoms or is unaware of the infection. The global average infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is roughly 0.23%. The average U.S. fatality rate is higher, probably 0.3% or 0.4%, because Americans are older and less healthy than those in most other countries. Underneath this average, the infection fatality rate increases exponentially with age. For an 85-year-old it may be 2,000 times as high as for an 18-year-old. This increase in the death rate by age is partly due to comorbidities, which increase with age.<br />The primary risk from SARS-CoV-2 is infection leading to death. Those who die lose years based on statistical life expectancy. A person’s expected years lost is equal to the infection fatality rate times life expectancy times probability of infection.</td>

      <td>Being an immigrant once meant leaving your country of birth behind. No longer.</td>
      <td>I’m an immigrant, happy and assimilated. I pay closer attention to America than I do to other parts of the world. This isn’t only because I live here. Settling in a country calls for integration that is meticulous, not just heartfelt. That doesn’t mean that I wall myself off from the world. Like many immigrants, I also pay near-obsessive attention to the land of my birth.<br />Previous immigrant generations needed to erase their old selves to become American. You were more American by being less Italian, or by letting the Greek or Serb in you dwindle. But America now demands less. I’ve never felt pressed to forget India, where I was born. Even if I’d wanted to, I wouldn’t be able, because of technology. An immigrant now can never let go of the country of his birth.<br />These days have been suffused with India. I’ve spent my waking hours reading and watching news, talking to people by telephone, taking in tweets and  Facebook  posts, all of which describe the enormity of India’s pandemic collapse. A decade ago, I spoke to Liberian immigrants who followed from afar that country’s battle with Ebola, and also to people from Haiti as they wrestled with the earthquake’s aftermath. They spoke to me of their impotence (at being unable to help), their guilt (being in America while relatives perished from precisely the sort of fate the immigrant moved here to avoid), and their gut-churning sense of distance from loved ones who’d been sickened or buried under rubble in Port-au-Prince.<br />I’m in close touch with my family. I speak daily to my mother, who is isolating at home in Delhi, and to my sister, who’s raising her Zoom-schooled sons in that city and doing her job as an elementary-school teacher. My brother works as an editor, putting out a publication whose reporters go out, masked and tireless, writing up the grim news they see. A part of that news was the death of his own wife’s father.<br />India’s Covid ordeal, like Liberia’s Ebola and Haiti’s earthquake, is a curse of nature. But its effects on a wondrous, ambitious country have been magnified by the dereliction of India’s government. Which takes me back to my starting point. Immigrants in generations past would assimilate by cutting their civic cords to the places from which they came. You couldn’t be properly American if you didn’t move on.</td>

      <td>Young children are clearly happier and healthier when they spend the day at home with a parent.</td>
      <td>In his first address to Congress, President Biden proposed spending an extra $225 billion on child care. That’s on top of the $40 billion the administration is already spending as part of the “bailout” of child-care providers in Mr. Biden’s American Rescue Plan, and the $10.3 billion the federal government normally spends on child-care subsidies. The new plan, billed as an effort to help low- and moderate-income families, would put America on a path to becoming a society where the state assumes much of the care of young children. Many Republicans have balked at the cost of Mr. Biden’s spending blowout, but in this case the substance matters more than the money. A dramatic expansion of child care is a bad deal for American parents. More important, it’s a bad deal for American children.<br />Criticism of the Biden approach invites immediate scorn from certain elite quarters. Brown University economist Emily Osterargues that criticisms of Mr. Biden’s proposal are “not supported by the data. . . . Child care is not ‘terrible for children.’ ” The essential point isn’t that “child care” is bad for kids, however, but that a federal push to get droves of children into daycare is. These are two different things, raising radically different questions. For example, how can we ensure safe facilities and capable caregivers for millions of additional children moved abruptly into child care? Hardly a trivial logistical challenge.<br />Moreover, the available empirical data contradict Ms. Oster’s argument. In 1997 the provincial government of Quebec began offering child care for 5 Canadian dollars a day to all families, regardless of income. Almost two decades later, economists Michael Baker, Kevin Milligan and Jonathan Gruber found that children from two-parent families who participated showed significant increases in anxiety, aggression and hyperactivity. Those effects persisted—and even grew—as they reached young adulthood. Self-reported health and life satisfaction decreased significantly. Boys who participated were more likely to commit crimes. It was, to put it bluntly, a disaster for Quebec’s children.<br />Some advocates argue that Quebec’s failure proves simply that low-quality care produces low-quality results, something they think the U.S. could surely avoid. This ignores the federal government’s persistent failure to provide high-quality care for the relatively small number of children in the $10 billion Head Start program. It also ignores that even high-quality child care in the U.S. is linked to negative social and emotional outcomes for children who spend lots of time in institutional care. A major longitudinal study conducted by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development found that the more time infants and toddlers spent in nonfamilial care, the more likely they were to engage in aggressive, disobedient or risky behavior.<br />That doesn’t mean child care is bad for all kids. Research shows that high-quality care is often beneficial for children from disadvantaged homes. But young children from average, healthy homes can be harmed by spending long hours in child care. Moving millions of young children out of their homes into nonparental group care will have unintended negative effects on children’s emotional and social well-being.</td>

      <td>Health experts say Americans need to continue to follow public-health guidance and states need to push vaccinations</td>
      <td>With more than 40% of all U.S. adults fully vaccinated and the daily number of new Covid-19 cases declining, governors across the U.S. are broadly rolling back restrictions implemented during the pandemic.<br />On Monday, governors from New York and New Jersey said their states would on May 19 lift most capacity restrictions at places of business.<br />Neighboring Connecticut previously ended many capacity restrictions and announced in April that it would end all restrictions on businesses beginning May 19, except for indoor masking requirements. On Monday, Connecticut became the first state in the U.S. to have 50% of its adults fully vaccinated, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />Outdoor and indoor gathering limits are also being adjusted upward, said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, while businesses, including Broadway theaters, museums, offices and retailers can now make their own decisions on reopening plans.<br />“The key is smart reopening. Reopening is not a light switch,” said Mr. Cuomo.</td>

      <td>The GOP senator forced the president and vice president to respond to him.</td>
      <td>Kamala Harris went first. In the Republican response to Joe Biden’s address to Congress, Sen. Tim Scott avowed that America “is not a racist country.” The next day on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” the vice president was asked if she agreed with him.<br />“I don’t think America is a racist country,” she said, “but we also do have to speak truth about the history of racism in our country and its existence today.”<br />The following day, it was President Biden’s turn. In an interview with NBC’s “Today,” he, too, was asked about Mr. Scott’s characterization—and he, too, agreed. “I don’t think America’s racist,” he said, “but I think the overhang from all of the Jim Crow [laws], and before that slavery, have had a cost, and we have to deal with it.”<br />Though no one was impolite enough to bring it up, Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris would never have said what they did if the black Republican senator from South Carolina hadn’t used his moment to force their hands. Essentially, he dared them to speak aloud the logical conclusion from all their repeated references to systemic racism and the threat of white supremacy. Wisely recognizing that this would be political poison, they flinched.<br />How different from only two weeks ago, when a Columbus, Ohio, police officer saved the life of a black teenager by shooting another black teen about to stab her. Asked about it, White House press secretary Jen Psaki went right for the progressive go-to: “Black women and girls, like black men and boys, experience higher rates of police violence.”</td>

      <td>Democracy hasn’t advanced, but the U.S. has bolstered its regional interests.</td>
      <td>Ten years after Seal Team Six put an end to Osama bin Laden’s terrorist career, most observers think of America’s 21st-century Middle East policy as a succession of ghastly failures. Certainly ambitious efforts by both Republican and Democratic presidents to transform the region fell far short of success. Yet if the Middle East is less peaceful and no more democratic than it was in 2001, the U.S. has dramatically reduced the ability of regional upheavals to provoke major crises around the world. While withdrawing entirely would be unwise, America can defend its vital interests with less risk and a more focused strategy than at any time since the end of the Cold War.<br />As the Biden administration addresses the remaining issue that poses a major threat to U.S. regional interests—Iran’s quest for regional superpower status based on its nuclear program and support for militias and terrorists—it should reflect on what Washington and its allies have gotten right over the past 20 years.<br />The first achievement involves one of the great unheralded successes of our time: America’s prevention of major new international terrorist attacks on its soil. With help from key partners around the world, U.S. security institutions have kept Americans largely safe since 9/11. To appreciate the value of this achievement, think what the world and the U.S. would look like if 9/11 had been only the first of a succession of massive attacks.<br />The second decisive success is that fracking has dramatically reduced the Middle East’s ability to roil world energy markets. The days are long past when even minor crises in the region could send energy prices surging around the world. Middle East oil still matters, but emirs and ayatollahs can no longer cause global economic upheavals by manipulating prices through the oil cartel.<br />In the third place, as the raid that killed bin Laden demonstrated, America’s reach has grown very long. Stunning advances in drone technology and precision weapons targeting are part of the story. So too are the extraordinary capabilities of U.S. special operations forces. Add to that the ability of very small numbers of American forces to increase vastly the battle effectiveness of local allies by hooking them up to the information available through integrated communications and surveillance, and the U.S. ability to project a lot of power with a small presence is a game changer in the Middle East and beyond.</td>

      <td>A band of healthcare elites saw that Covid-19 was more dangerous than U.S. leaders acknowledged. Would their advice have made a difference?</td>
      <td>It is an article of faith among America’s educated elite that the United States is uniquely bad at solving big problems. Urban sprawl, economic inequality, nuclear proliferation, environmental degradation, whatever—the American intelligentsia can be counted on to conclude that other developed nations handle these perils more judiciously than the U.S. does. You wonder how the country hasn’t collapsed under the weight of its own incompetence.<br />Michael Lewis’s “The Premonition: A Pandemic Story” is a book-length expression of this belief. It is the story of a loosely connected group of doctors, scientists and public-health experts whose research led them to see that the novel coronavirus raging in Wuhan, China, in early 2020 was far more dangerous than U.S. health officials and political leaders realized. This global group of “Wolverines,” as they came to call themselves, tried to warn the U.S. government, but nobody listened in time.<br />“In February 2021,” Mr. Lewis explains in the book’s introduction, “The Lancet published a long critique of the U.S. pandemic performance. By then 450,000 Americans had died. The Lancet pointed out that if the COVID death rate in the United States had simply tracked the average of the other six G7 nations, 180,000 of those people would still be alive.” If only the experts had been listened to, the book implies, these “missing Americans” would be with us still.<br />The article Mr. Lewis is referring to is a cringe-making leftist rant. (A sentence taken at random: “Donald Trump stirred up the underlying racial animus of US society to deflect attention from policies that abet billionaires’ accretion of wealth and power.”) The article, in any case, doesn’t claim that 180,000 people could have been saved by more robust public-health interventions in early 2020 but that those deaths are mostly the result of Americans’ poor health. That the U.S. death rate, even so, is lower than that of the U.K. and Italy and nearly equal to that of France—all G7 nations—rather complicates Mr. Lewis’s breezy thesis.<br />It is amazing to me that intelligent people in 2021 can survey the past year and conclude that some alternative set of non-pharmaceutical interventions would have made an appreciable difference in the spread of this magnificently resilient virus. But many such people do believe that, including the author of this book and its ostensible heroes. One of those heroes, an accomplished hospital administrator named Carter Mecher, drew up a national pandemic response plan for the George W. Bush administration. The key to stopping dangerous pathogens, he came to believe as he studied pandemic modeling, was closing schools.</td>
