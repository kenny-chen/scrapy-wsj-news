      <td>The move, affecting stocks in seven Chinese companies, will take effect by the close of business on Jan. 5</td>
      <td>MSCI Inc.  will strip its indexes of stocks in seven Chinese companies that the U.S. government says help China’s military, including the country’s largest chip maker and a major producer of surveillance equipment.<br />The move, which will take effect by the close of business on Jan. 5, follows similar actions by other benchmark providers including FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices. It will affect 10 securities that trade in either Hong Kong, Shanghai or Shenzhen.<br />Last month, President Trump signed an executive order barring Americans from investing in 31 Chinese companies that the U.S. Defense Department says supply and otherwise support China’s military, intelligence and security services.<br />In a statement after U.S. markets closed Tuesday, MSCI said its list only includes securities issued by companies explicitly named in the order, but not those from subsidiaries or affiliated companies.<br />That means some of the largest stocks that could potentially have been affected by the order—such as  China Mobile Ltd. , which has a roughly $117 billion market value—have been spared, and the overall impact on indexes will be limited. FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones took a similar approach.</td>

The number of new death sentences imposed this year—a total of 18 as of mid-December—is the fewest since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976, the report said.<br />Ten executions were carried out under the federal death penalty, the first time that the U.S. government performed more civilian death sentences than the states did combined.<br />At least 11 executions were halted or delayed—through stays, reprieves or reschedulings—because of coronavirus-related precautions, according to the center.<br />Just last month, a federal district judge in Washington postponed the Dec. 8 execution of Lisa Montgomery through year’s end after her lawyers contracted Covid-19.</td>

      <td>SUVs are getting too big—and too pricey. Kia’s sleeker midsize Sorento trims the fat without sacrificing the third-row seat, giving the middle class a break, says Dan Neil.</td>
      <td>THE 2021  Kia  Sorento is a midsize crossover with third-row seating. I find that utterly fascinating.<br />In the past I’ve complained about the spiraling size of SUVs and pickups, as auto makers and dealers push U.S. consumers into ever larger vehicles, because—at the risk of being reductive—they are more profitable. It would be easy for a small family to walk into a dealership and drive off with a full-size, three-row SUV, having blown their budget, convinced the third row will pay for itself in convenience over 72 months of car payments.<br />The emergence of midsize crossovers with third-row seats represents the counter trend in consumer preference: right-sizing. Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Mazda CX-9, Subaru Ascent, GMC Acadia, VW Atlas, Nissan Pathfinder. All now have third-row seating options, formerly the exclusive domain of L- and XL-sized vehicles. All are cheaper to buy, feed and maintain than the full-size brand alternative.<br />Example: Kia’s own Telluride SUV is 7.9 inches longer and about $2,600 more than the new Sorento. The Telluride is well priced and well reviewed, and has the option of seven or eight seats. But for buyers who foresee using these seats only sparingly, the midsize option may pencil out better, now that it’s here.<br />As was inscribed at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Know thyself, carbuyers. Those two or three extra seats could cost a lot, or a little. How often do you expect to have more than five people in your car; how old will they be; and how comfortable, for how long? Kids are bendy. I’ve owned a seven-passenger minivan for years. I can’t remember the last time every seat was filled. And yet car buyers are often consumed with fears of “What if?” Third-row seats, bike racks, multi-mode vehicle dynamics, launch control, paddle shifters, low-range 4x4, seat massagers, 300-mile EV range: just a few of the features people pay scads for and use rarely, if ever. Third-row seats are like gym memberships.</td>

      <td>Online marketplace for sneakers and streetwear raised $275 million from private investors</td>
      <td>StockX LLC, an online marketplace popular with sneaker collectors, raised a fresh round of funding that valued the startup at $2.8 billion, more than doubling its valuation from last year.<br />Investors, including Tiger Global Management and Altimeter Capital, put $275 million in the company this week. StockX has now raised $490 million through private investors.<br />StockX Chief Executive Scott Cutler, a former executive at eBay Inc. and the New York Stock Exchange, said in an interview that the company was profitable for the first time in the third quarter, with revenue rising 75% year over year. He said the website averaged a record 25 million monthly visitors in the quarter, including 10 million over the Black Friday weekend. “I think that’s just representative of the growth in the business.”<br />The Detroit-based company started in 2016 as an online platform to buy and sell rare sneaker models, before expanding into streetwear, handbags, accessories and electronics. StockX emulates a stock exchange by providing market data for items, including the 52-week high and volatility. It generates revenue by keeping a percentage of each transaction.<br />StockX joins online companies, including  Wayfair Inc.  and  Etsy Inc.,  that have benefited from changes to shopping habits during the coronavirus pandemic. High-profile startups  DoorDash Inc.  and  Airbnb Inc.  went public this month and surged in their first day of trading.</td>

      <td>With so much uncertainty, let’s embrace a policy agenda that is premised on curiosity</td>
      <td>As the debate over big tech and antitrust intensified over the past year, certainty reigned.<br />On one side are those who are certain that companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are monopolies, dominant in individual markets like search, social networking, e-commerce and app stores. They are certain that mergers between companies like Facebook and Instagram reduced competition. And they’re certain that antitrust law has calcified, unable to account for new technologies. As a recent report by the House Judiciary Committee claimed, “companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups…have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons.”<br />On the other side of the debate are those who are certain that competition is flourishing in the tech sector, with innovation yielding great products at ever-lower prices, and companies like TikTok and Snap emerging to challenge incumbents. They are certain that mergers have benefited consumers. And they’re certain that we don’t need to re-examine antitrust doctrine because it’s flexible enough to evolve with technology.<br />In the course of this debate, I’ve espoused my own certainties. When I worked for Facebook, it never felt like we could afford to be complacent. We faced real competitive threats. If I had shown up at a meeting and announced that Facebook didn’t compete with Google, Apple or TikTok, I would have been laughed out of the room. And I saw Facebook’s investment in developing new features for its Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions and improving the safety, security and infrastructure of both products. So it’s hard for me to reconcile my experience in the tech sector with the antitrust arguments now being waged against it.<br />But if November’s election taught us anything, it’s that our assumptions are often wrong. With polls predicting a blue-wave election that never materialized, predictions that seemed certain before the election now seem flimsy in the wake of it.</td>

      <td>Moves by high-profile companies to Texas from California are likely to improve the personal finances of executives and offer employees more affordable housing—but make little difference to the firms’ tax bills.<br />Oracle Corp.  and  Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co.  are the latest big corporations to announce moves to the Lone Star State. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc., is also moving to Texas, and the electric car company is expanding there.<br />The announcements have highlighted the vastly different tax and regulatory systems in the country’s two most populous states. California relies more on taxing personal income, particularly of high-income households, and operates a growing regulatory structure. Texas leans on more regressive property and sales taxes and boasts a more laissez-faire environment. The biggest difference: High-paid executives who move can see their state income-tax bills go from 13.3% to nothing.<br />But corporate investors hoping for big tax and other savings may need to temper their enthusiasm. Business-tax considerations are likely to prove secondary at best, tax and economic-development experts say. They are dwarfed by the allure of more-affordable housing, lower cost of living and lighter regulatory burdens.<br />For companies, much of the difference between California and Texas boils down to ease and cost of hiring—not just now but down the road.</td>

      <td>Mayor Anne Hidalgo appointed 11 women and five men to senior roles at city hall in 2018, and now has to pay a $110,000 fine</td>
      <td>The city government of Paris has been dealt an unlikely punishment: a fine of 90,000 euros, equivalent to $110,000, for appointing too many women to senior positions and breaking France’s gender-equality rules.<br />The offense dates back to 2018, when Mayor Anne Hidalgo appointed 11 women and five men to her senior team at a time when administrations around the world were trying to increase female representation in governments. But with 69% of the positions going to women and 31% to men, Paris broke national government rules to promote equality, which require that at least 40% of new positions should be allocated to each gender.<br />A waiver was introduced in 2019 if the new hires didn’t lead to a broader gender imbalance. That would seem to be the case for Paris, where women account for just under a half of senior officials in city hall. But the initial round of appointments predated the waiver, meaning the Paris government was still on the hook.<br />Ms. Hidalgo told a meeting of the city council on Tuesday that the appointments helped give women a louder voice in government in France and, with tongue in cheek, said she was delighted to pay the fine.<br />“In Paris, we are doing everything to make it a success, and I am very proud of a large team of women and men who together carry this fight for equality,” Ms. Hidalgo said.</td>

      <td>The proposal is a way to help Europe’s creaky banks navigate the downturn and be strong enough to lend during the recovery</td>
      <td>The European Union unveiled plans to assist countries in setting up a network of national “bad banks” to help cope with a possible avalanche of defaulted loans triggered by the pandemic.<br />Bad banks—private or government funded repositories that soak up soured loans—are seen as a way to help Europe’s creaky banks navigate the Covid-19 downturn and be strong enough to lend during the recovery. The European Central Bank, which supervises the largest banks in the eurozone, has warned banks could be facing $1.7 trillion in bad loans under an extreme, yet possible, economic scenario.<br />The proposal for the bad banks announced Wednesday by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, underscores its limits in trying to create EU-wide solutions that all member states can agree on. The effort would rely on individual governments to sponsor the bad banks, falling short of more ambitious proposals for a continentwide bad bank.<br />Banks in the south of Europe, such as Italy, Spain and Greece, tend to see a surge in loan defaults during economic downturns. The issue is less severe in richer northern European countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, which have blamed individual countries and their banks for their troubles.<br />Bad loans have been a big problem for the bloc since the sovereign-debt crisis in 2011, when banks choked on mountains of defaulted loans, hurting profits and their ability to lend. Banks were still cleaning up their balance sheets when the coronavirus pandemic hit.</td>

And it isn’t only the well-off taking part. Less-affluent shoppers are buying items like premium spaghetti sauce or salon-worthy shampoo that was previously out of reach or thought to be not worth the price before the coronavirus pandemic forced people to curtail activities and isolate.<br />Stephanie Moon bought a Chloé handbag on sale for $600 this summer as a reward for signing her first client to her newly launched consulting firm. The 38-year-old San Francisco resident said she doesn’t usually buy designer bags, but felt like she could afford one now.<br />“I’m saving so much money, because I’m not going anywhere or doing anything,” she said. “Normally, I’d treat myself to a night out with my girlfriends, but that wasn’t an option this year.”</td>

      <td>The wildly popular trading platform exposed Massachusetts investors to ‘unnecessary trading risks,’ according to the complaint</td>
      <td>Massachusetts securities regulators are expected to file a complaint Wednesday against the wildly popular trading platform operated by Robinhood Financial LLC, alleging the company aggressively marketed to inexperienced investors and failed to implement controls to protect them.<br />In a final draft of a more than 20-page administrative complaint reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the enforcement arm of the Massachusetts Securities Division said Robinhood failed to protect its customers and their assets, violating state laws and regulations. Robinhood exposed Massachusetts investors to “unnecessary trading risks” by “falling far short of the fiduciary standard” adopted this year that requires broker-dealers to act in their clients’ best interest, the state said.<br />A Robinhood spokeswoman said the company hadn’t seen the complaint but will continue to work closely with all regulators.<br />“Robinhood has opened up financial markets for a new generation of people who were previously excluded,” she said. “We are committed to operating with integrity, transparency, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”<br />The complaint from the office of William Galvin, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, marks the latest round of scrutiny that the popular brokerage has faced in its short history. Since it was founded less than a decade ago, Robinhood has exploded in popularity, amassing more than 13 million customer accounts.

However, those restrictions have already been reimposed in parts of Europe over recent days, and tightened in Germany from Wednesday.</td>

      <td>New network-security legislation is latest setback for U.S. effort to rein in Chinese tech giant</td>
      <td>BERLIN—The German government on Wednesday moved to allow the use of Huawei’s technology in 5G mobile networks in exchange for assurances by the Chinese vendor about the safety of its gear, in a rebuke to the Trump administration.<br />The bill, which still requires parliamentary approval, marks a setback for the outgoing U.S. administration, which has long lobbied European allies to reject Huawei’s technology. The U.S. claims that Huawei gear is akin to a Trojan horse that once inside critical infrastructure in the West can be used by China to spy and steal sensitive information, posing a security and economic threat to the U.S. and its allies. The company denies those allegations.<br />In light of German industry’s dependence on China—the country is Germany’s largest trade partner and the biggest market for many German companies—Berlin has been reluctant to saddle up with Washington, instead seeking a middle ground that would allow Huawei to do business in Germany but with sufficient monitoring to appease its wary U.S. ally.<br />When the government published a draft of the bill earlier this month, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that the government sought to create a legal basis that would address network-security concerns but also keep the market open to competitive technologies.<br />“We’ve created regulation that allows us to monitor trustworthiness in an appropriate fashion. Our security interests played a big role,” Mr. Seehofer told the German business daily Handelsblatt.</td>

      <td>Retail sales in November are forecast to decline, ending six months of spending growth</td>
      <td>U.S. consumers have pulled back on purchases and limited holiday shopping in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic triggered new business restrictions, potentially snapping a six-month stretch of retail sales growth.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast that retail sales decreased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in November from a month earlier. The Commerce Department will release the November figures on Wednesday.<br />That would mark the first month-over-month decline since April in the department’s measure of spending at stores, vehicle dealerships, restaurants and online.<br />Expected weakness in automotive sales will likely contribute to the decline, along with “the fact that people are starting to stay at home again,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at consulting firm Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. A rise in coronavirus infections is starting to affect sales at businesses such as restaurants, he added.<br />The U.S. economy continues to recover, but at a slower pace. Hiring growth slowed in November while worker filings for unemployment benefits recently increased. Overall consumer spending, which includes retail and services consumption, has continued to increase, but more slowly than over the summer. Consumer confidence has been mixed, with one survey reflecting a brighter outlook for the economy beyond the pandemic.</td>

Hours after the second shot, she said she was sure it was the genuine article.<br />“I woke up around midnight freezing,” said the 68-year-old retired nurse. “For the next 24 hours I had intense chills, serious neck pain, headache, all my joints were aching.” She had a fever that peaked at 102.4 and poured out so much sweat that she lost 3 pounds, she said. The following day she woke up and felt fine.<br />Ms. Edwards, like the other 30,000 volunteers who took part in Phase 3 clinical trials for Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, wasn’t told whether she got the vaccine or a placebo. However, she said a trial researcher attributed her symptoms to her body mounting a strong immune response to what was most likely the vaccine. “It’s better having 36 hours of feeling really rough than getting Covid,” she said.<br />Moderna declined to comment for this article.<br />As the first vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  rolls out this week and the next one from Moderna looks poised to start reaching people soon, some Americans have expressed reservations about getting vaccinated. One concern has been possible side effects. While the data show that some Moderna and Pfizer trial volunteers experienced side effects, even those who had harsh reactions recommend the shots.</td>

Expectations for new legislation aimed at combating climate change under a Biden administration are likely to stoke demand for ESG funds over the coming years, and several asset managers are rushing to meet that demand.<br />Asset managers have launched 31 ESG-related ETFs so far this year, nearly double last year’s sum and bringing the total number of products in the U.S. to more than 100, according to Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research at FactSet.<br />BlackRock Inc.  has been among the most prolific, recently rolling out ETFs that are based on the S&P 500 and other indexes but exclude companies involved in the fossil-fuel, tobacco and weapons industries.

Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.3%.<br />Signs of progress toward a fresh fiscal-stimulus package buoyed sentiment on Tuesday, allowing the S&P 500 to break a four-day losing streak. Top congressional leaders signaled they were inching closer to striking a deal after a day of meetings. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he’s optimistic, fueling bets that lawmakers will craft the new aid package before the holidays and the expiration of several key aid provisions.<br />Hopes for the new stimulus package have become the latest catalyst for a market rally that has sent the S&P 500 index up over 14% this year, despite the economic setback triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.<br />“It is just another excuse for those that missed the rally, or that are bullish anyway to buy into it,” said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. “We know that [a deal is] coming, the signals are pretty clear,” he added.</td>

      <td>Real-estate developers provide much-needed economic activity and land purchases. A squeeze on their balance sheets by the government would have impacts on international markets.</td>
      <td>China’s real-estate developers contributed significantly to its recovery this year, revving up sales and construction activity as the world’s second-largest economy began to shrug off the economic effects of the pandemic.<br />But it isn’t clear whether they will be able to repeat the same act next year. Markets that are sensitive to the conditions in the sector, especially industrial metals like steel and copper, may begin to reflect that.<br />Late last month, China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission chief Guo Shuqing labeled real estate the country’s largest “gray rhino:” an obvious and highly dangerous threat that is tough to tackle.<br />Most listed real-estate developers breach at least one of three “red lines”—specific leverage ratios to avoid—which haven’t been officially announced, but which are repeatedly identified in state media. As of the end of the first half of 2020, only six major developers passed all three tests, according to  BNP Paribas .  Nine breached all three, among them Sunac and Evergrande, two of the country’s largest property firms.<br />In theory, where developers place on the redlines test will determine how much debt they can raise in the subsequent year. And without the ability to add leverage, their ability to buy the land required to finance local governments would be more limited. Analysts at Nomura expect land-sales revenue to rise by just 5% next year, down from 9% this year, the slowest increase in at least five years.</td>

With majority ownership of Finite, BP plans to take global the business of paying landowners not to cut down trees.<br />BP and Finite didn’t disclose financial terms of the latest deal but said that the forestry firm was now part of the energy company’s Launchpad. The unit functions similarly to a private-equity firm by taking big economic stakes in businesses with an eye toward steering them through expansion.<br />“Finite Carbon has the potential to build a global platform for managing and financing natural climate solutions,” said David Eyton, BP’s executive vice president of innovation and engineering.<br />BP itself has been one of the world’s biggest buyers of forest carbon-offset credits, a type of climate-change currency. The company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on offsets to comply with California regulators. They operate a so-called cap-and-trade system that aims to reduce greenhouse gasses by making it more expensive over time for companies operating in the state to pollute.</td>

The Fed’s point man for financial regulation, Randal Quarles, noted recently that the U.S. central bank had sought to join after it had already been engaging with the group on an informal basis.<br />In a statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said “as we develop our understanding of how best to assess the impact of climate change on the financial system, we look forward to continuing and deepening our discussions with our NGFS colleagues from around the world.”<br />The network, which launched three years ago, is a forum for central bankers and regulators to come together and discuss how their institutions can ensure their financial systems don’t worsen climate change risks, and how financial institutions might be able to lower those risks.</td>

      <td>Here are some of the messages of hope that spiritual leaders are delivering during the pandemic</td>
      <td>The Rev. Carmen D’Amico stood before his congregation in Muse, a former coal town in western Pennsylvania, and talked about not giving into despair and darkness.<br />“Being in a pandemic doesn’t mean you stop doing what is good,” he told the members of Holy Rosary Catholic Church on a recent rainy Sunday morning, all wearing masks and sitting in every third pew to keep safe distance. “If you know someone is alone, call them up. Reach out to them. Do you have elderly neighbors who need their leaves raked? Do it. Don’t wait for anyone to ask you.”<br />Simple actions matter, he says. “We need to support each other to get through this. We need to be the light for each other.”<br />Religious and community leaders, who like everyone else have been grappling with Covid-19 for months, need a special message for the 2020 holiday season. People are exhausted by the crisis that they thought would be over by now. Many have lost loved ones and jobs. They miss family and friends they can’t safely visit, an absence deeply felt during a season traditionally filled with gatherings and festive concerts and pageants.<br />Here are some of the messages that spiritual leaders are delivering during a time of distress.</td>
