      <td>Letlow was set to be sworn in with new freshmen in Congress on Sunday</td>
      <td>Louisiana Rep.-elect Luke Letlow died of Covid-19, just days before the Republican was set to be sworn in as a new member of Congress, his spokesman said Tuesday. He was 41.<br />Mr. Letlow won a runoff election this month to replace his former boss, Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham, who represents the Fifth Congressional District in the state. It is the state’s largest district and mostly rural, covering the northeastern and central parts of the state.<br />“The family appreciates the numerous prayers and support over the past days but asks for privacy during this difficult and unexpected time,” said Andrew Bautsch, the Letlow family representative.<br />Mr. Letlow was set to be sworn-in on Jan. 3. Though new to elected office, he wasn’t new to Congress. He served as Mr. Abraham’s chief of staff, interned for former Republican Rep. John Cooksey, and worked for Republican Bobby Jindal when Mr. Jindal was in Congress and later served on his gubernatorial staff, according to the Monroe News Star newspaper.<br />He is survived by his wife and two young children. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said on Twitter he had spoken to Mr. Letlow’s wife, Julia, and offered his condolences. Other Louisiana officials mourned the loss.</td>

The scenic property, in a high-end neighborhood called Shouson Hill, includes six low-rise buildings with 26 apartments and a rooftop swimming pool.<br />A representative of the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong previously said the sale of the Shouson Hill compound was purely the result of a business decision, made as part of a global reinvestment program by the State Department.<br />The deal didn’t close on Dec. 30 as scheduled. On Wednesday, Hang Lung said it was informed last week by Hong Kong’s Land Registry that the sale can’t be completed without the written consent of the Chinese government.<br />China’s imposition of a national-security law on Hong Kong this year has helped stoke tensions between Washington and Beijing. The Trump administration in recent months has imposed sanctions on senior government officials in China and Hong Kong for actions that the U.S. said have eroded Hong Kong’s autonomy.</td>

      <td>THE LAST THING anyone needed was another virtual meeting. And yet, in October, more than 1,100 fans of radicchio tuned in to “Rad TV,” a day’s worth of YouTube programming to fete their favorite bitter vegetable. Academics retold its history (did you know radicchio only became a staple in Italy in the 20th century?), plant breeders shared growing techniques, chefs demo’d recipes such as radicchio tarte tatin and grilled radicchio salad with anchovy dressing.<br />Bitter vegetables don’t usually have fan clubs. But radicchio, a kind of chicory, has earned a passionate following of small farmers, chefs and plant breeders who prize its capacity to grow in cold temperatures—keeping farmers busy during the slow season—as well as its flavor and range of vivid hues. Most of us know (and most supermarkets offer) the densely layered, burgundy-leaved Radicchio di Chioggia. Other tempting varieties include the pale-green, speckled Variegato di Castelfranco, the delicate, pink Rosa del Veneto and the oblong, almost tentacled Rosso di Treviso Tardivo. These are seasonal, available now through early spring.<br />Besides being gorgeous, the fresh, grilled or wilted leaves set off the season’s rich, fatty foods and add much-missed freshness to a winter plate. And unlike those wimpy, bagged salad greens, radicchio will last weeks in the fridge.</td>

Still, the S&P 500 ended Tuesday at its second-highest closing level in history.<br />The rollout of coronavirus vaccines and the passage of the new $900 billion fiscal stimulus package has helped buoy market sentiment in the final weeks of the year. But elevated levels of Covid-19 infections, the emergence of a fast-spreading variant of the virus, economic data showing the rebound is slowing, and the back and forth in Washington over the size of stimulus checks has tempered some of that optimism.<br />“We are going to keep getting this push-pull, vaccine versus virus, politics versus economics, for a while yet,” said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for State Street Global Advisors in Europe. “November was a great month for markets and there was always going to be a pause for breath. December seems to be just that.”</td>

It commits Beijing to end forced technology transfers and increase transparency over how it subsidizes firms.<br />European officials say they are gaining more than they are giving in the deal, which has won backing from leaders of all 27 EU countries but still needs their governments’ formal approval and will face a vote in the European Parliament. The Europeans also say the pact provides similar advantages to those the U.S. gained when it signed its “phase-one” trade agreement with China, which took effect early this year.<br />Critics of the deal in both the U.S. and Europe say that even if it gives the EU short-term commercial gains, it binds the bloc’s economy more closely to China’s and could help build the increasingly authoritarian country’s economic might just as Western leaders are working to check it.<br />U.S. officials have also expressed concern that the accord will help Beijing deflect external pressure to reform its state-driven economic model. Critics say Beijing has acceded to long-sought European requests in part because it wants to divide Brussels and Washington.</td>

It stressed that vaccine recipients would still get a second dose, just three months later than planned.<br />Some provinces in Canada have been delaying the second dose to inoculate more people at once, and Belgium is considering a similar approach.</td>

Instead it has started using third-party employees, a first for the company.<br />Gig-economy companies say reclassifying workers as employees would add to costs, reduce workers’ flexibility and result in lost jobs.

      <td>Regulatory outlook appears promising, and Covid-19 vaccines could give the industry political capital</td>
      <td>In the year ahead, investors should expect Big Pharma to have its wallet open. Investors hunting for buyouts should think big.<br />Total deal volume for the drug industry has reached $253 billion globally so far this year, according to Dealogic. That is down from a record $432 billion in 2019. The onset of the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with election-related uncertainty over future industry regulations meant fewer large deals were agreed upon.<br />Investors are expecting that to change, and for good reason. For starters, the regulatory outlook seems far brighter than some had feared. President-elect Joe Biden did vow to implement tough new drug-pricing measures during the campaign. But with the pandemic still unfolding, it is unlikely to be a priority for the administration.<br />The ultimate balance of power in the Senate is still uncertain, but the blue wave that investors feared ahead of the election didn’t materialize. Even with a narrow Democratic majority, getting broad legislation through the Senate will be a challenge. And while Big Pharma is always a popular target for politicians, the industry might get some political capital from having developed safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines in record time.<br />As such, deal activity has picked up lately. This month,  AstraZeneca  agreed to purchase  Alexion Pharmaceuticals  for $39 billion in cash and stock, and  Eli Lilly  agreed to buy gene-therapy startup  Prevail Therapeutics  for $880 million in upfront cash and more than $1 billion if certain development milestones are reached.</td>

      <td>Activist call to evaluate strategic options could help chip maker make some painful choices</td>
      <td>Chip making is a complicated business. Fixing a broken chip maker is more complicated still.<br />Such was laid bare by a letter to  Intel Corp.  Tuesday from well-known shareholder activist Dan Loeb of Third Point. The letter comes months after the chip maker disclosed new problems with its latest manufacturing process that put it even further behind  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , or TSMC. It also comes just a few weeks before Intel is expected to announce whether it will begin outsourcing some future manufacturing needs to its rival, as part of an effort to rectify the problem. That announcement is expected in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call, scheduled for Jan. 21.<br />Mr. Loeb appears to disfavor this strategy, citing the “vital role” Intel plays in national security by maintaining domestic chip-making capabilities. But his suggestion that Intel engage a “reputable investment advisor” to help it evaluate whether it should even remain an integrated chip manufacturer could add to the problem, as the most natural buyers for Intel’s manufacturing operations are all overseas. Advanced Micro Devices Inc., or AMD, spun off its manufacturing arm more than a decade ago. That business, GlobalFoundries, is now majority owned by an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government.<br />And any buyer will be left with the same vexing problem of how to catch up to TSMC if it wants to remain competitive. New chip-making processes spend years in development before they get to high-volume manufacturing. And even if Intel fixes the issues it reported in July for its 7-nanometer process under development, the company is still well behind TSMC, which is already shipping even more advanced chips at 5 nanometers—including  Apple Inc.’s  new processors for its latest generation of iPhones.<br />But Mr. Loeb also called on Intel to evaluate the “potential divestment of certain failed acquisitions,” which might prove to be more helpful in the meantime. While he didn’t specify any particular deals, the company’s two largest to date—programmable chip specialist Altera and driver-assistance systems designer Mobileye—have done little to change its fortunes. Pressure from an activist could give Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan the cover needed to unwind some of those deals, which could raise capital and help Intel focus on the problems at hand.</td>

      <td>The Fed’s stance means the greenback’s weakness is likely to continue, but that isn’t a disaster for investors who position themselves correctly</td>
      <td>There are many reasons to expect a weaker U.S. dollar next year and perhaps for longer, but none more important than the new policy stance of the Federal Reserve.<br />The U.S. dollar briefly rallied in March due to its haven role in investment portfolios. Since then, it has dropped around 12% against a trade-weighted basket of currencies as the U.S. turned out to be even harder hit by the coronavirus pandemic than most major economies.<br />As vaccines are rolled out and the global economy snaps back, this trade won’t necessarily run in reverse. Rather, currencies of countries that export commodities and manufactured goods are likely to keep strengthening against the dollar, as would be seen in a typical global recovery. Some Asian exporters already are quietly intervening to limit their currencies’ rise.<br />But this time, reasons to expect a weaker dollar run even deeper. For several years before the pandemic, U.S. interest rates on both the long and short ends of the yield curve were substantially higher than in Europe and Japan—a major source of strength for the U.S. currency. That premium has largely disappeared, though, as the Fed lowered short-term rates to near zero and launched a new round of asset purchases. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes has fallen from almost 2% at the start of the year to around 0.93% now.<br />Granted, that is still well higher than the 0.02% and minus-0.58% yields on 10-year Japanese and German government bonds, respectively. But real yields in the U.S. are in fact lower on an inflation-adjusted basis, points out markets economist Simona Gambarini of Capital Economics. In the U.S., the core consumer-price index was 1.6% higher than a year earlier in November. That compares with slight deflation in Japan and the eurozone.</td>

Families and attorneys they hired to represent the activists haven’t been allowed to contact them. The defendants were appointed attorneys from the mainland, and their trial was held behind closed doors this week.<br />“They didn’t have proper legal representation, were detained in secret for months and the verdict was handed down after a secret trial,” said Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy politician who has been coordinating with the families of the 12. “The whole legal process is a joke but with serious consequences—we don’t even know how to appeal the sentence.”<br />The U.S. called for the release of the activists earlier this week. Foreign diplomats attempted to attend the trial but weren’t allowed inside.</td>

      <td>In Italy over 11% of the banks’ assets are in government debt, a record</td>
      <td>European banks are doing something that got them into trouble years ago: loading up on government debt, a trade investors call the “doom loop.”<br />Banks in the eurozone, stuffed with excess cash thanks to Covid-19 central bank relief efforts, bought close to €200 billion, the equivalent of $245 billion, in government debt of their home countries in the year to September. That has raised their holdings by 19% to €1.2 trillion, according to the European Central Bank.<br />This comes against the backdrop of massive government and central bank support packages that have buoyed assets. The ECB has been buying big quantities of eurozone government bonds, keeping their prices stable and making the investment safe for banks.<br />The fear is that behind the support lies increasingly fragile government finances, as countries borrow aggressively to counteract the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />It rekindles memories of Europe’s last financial crisis early last decade. In 2012, what started as a struggle by weaker eurozone countries to repay debts turned into a financial-sector crisis. Banks held mountains of government bonds that fell in value, triggering a spiral of ratings downgrades that sent bank borrowing costs up, leading to a credit crunch that slowed economic growth. That hit government finances and perpetuated the doom loop between banks and their sovereigns.</td>

Argentina will now permit elective abortion up to the 14th week of pregnancy, scrapping current legislation that only allows the procedure when a pregnancy results from rape or when a mother’s health is at risk.<br />The outcome was a blow to the ever-expanding evangelical movement and the Catholic Church in the country of 45 million. Pope Francis, who was born in Argentina, had actively backed antiabortion groups.<br />It is a momentous victory for a feminist movement, known for its green bandannas and energetic demonstrations, that didn’t give up even after the senate had rejected an abortion legalization bill just two years ago.<br />Although the movement had been around for years, it had gained strength following huge protests in 2015 triggered by the slaying of a 14-year-old pregnant girl.

Mr. Sheikh was originally sentenced to death and has been imprisoned for the past 18 years. The kidnapping charge carries a sentence of only seven years.<br />Pakistani authorities have been searching for a way to keep Mr. Sheikh detained—including appealing to the country’s Supreme Court to reinstate the conviction. Acting U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said Tuesday that if the authorities are unsuccessful, the U.S. was prepared to take the man into custody and pursue the case in the American court system.<br />“We remain grateful for the Pakistani government’s actions to appeal such rulings to ensure that he and his co-defendants are held accountable. If, however, those efforts do not succeed, the United States stands ready to take custody of Omar Sheikh to stand trial here. We cannot allow him to evade justice for his role in Daniel Pearl’s abduction and murder,” Mr. Rosen said.<br />The late Mr. Pearl was a veteran Wall Street Journal correspondent. While serving as the newspaper’s bureau chief for South Asia and reporting in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi in January 2002, he was kidnapped and killed by Islamic extremists. At the time, Mr. Pearl was reporting for an article about religious extremists in Pakistan as part of the paper’s coverage in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S.</td>

      <td>The feds seek billions in penalties for filling valid opioid prescriptions.</td>
      <td>One benefit of the Trump era has been the relative absence of dubious lawsuits against business. An exception is the Justice Department’s new suit against  Walmart  for filling opioid prescriptions.<br />The lawsuit in federal court in Delaware claims that Walmart “failed to detect and report at least hundreds of thousands of suspicious orders” and that as a pharmacy it “unlawfully filled thousands upon thousands of invalid controlled-substance prescriptions.” These actions enabled opioid abuse and “helped fuel a national crisis,” the feds say.<br />The complaint alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations, but it is really a 160-page exercise in scapegoating a company because it is well-known and has deep pockets. Walmart doesn’t push pills on opioid addicts. Its pharmacists fill valid prescriptions written by doctors who are licensed by their states and registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).<br />When Walmart’s pharmacists catch a prescription that appears fraudulent or forged, they are trained to refuse to fill it and document the incident. Walmart says it has passed tens of thousands of leads about suspicious prescriptions to state and federal law enforcement. It's the job of the DEA and state medical boards to investigate and revoke doctors’ licenses and prescribing privileges if there’s wrongdoing.<br />Yet the DEA rarely imposes such restrictions on physicians, and Walmart has no authority to act on its own. When pharmacists have refused to fill questionable prescriptions, doctors have sometimes sued for defamation and patients have sometimes sued for discrimination. Several states have prohibited pharmacists from interfering with the doctor-patient relationship by second-guessing valid prescriptions.</td>

      <td>Federal prosecutors said Tuesday they wouldn’t bring federal charges against two police officers in the fatal police shooting of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was killed in 2014 while playing with a toy gun.<br />The action closes a long-running civil-rights investigation into a case that helped spark a nationwide conversation on police use of force against Black Americans.<br />Prosecutors informed Tamir’s family of their decision this week and released a statement to the media on Tuesday, saying the boy’s death at the hands of two officers didn’t meet the standard for bringing federal civil-rights charges against the police.<br />To bring such charges, prosecutors would need to prove that the officers’ use of force was unreasonable and that the officers broke the law willfully and deliberately. The split-second decision to open fire on Tamir, based on the officers’ stated belief that the toy gun was a real threat, didn’t meet that burden, according to the department.<br />“Although Tamir Rice’s death is tragic, the evidence does not meet these substantial evidentiary requirements,” the Justice Department said.</td>

      <td>U.S. troops can’t be everywhere forever. But the Trump Administration hasn’t made a good case for its recently announced withdrawal from Somalia in Northeast Africa.<br />President Trump has often expressed his skepticism of American commitments abroad, but the Administration’s move on Somalia was relatively quiet. Mr. Trump ordered the military to “reposition the majority of personnel and assets out of Somalia by early 2021,” according to a Pentagon statement this month. “While a change in force posture, this action is not a change in U.S. policy,” the statement said. “The U.S. will retain the capability to conduct targeted counterterrorism operations in Somalia.”<br />Even if it can achieve some objectives from outside the country, it would be losing the influence that comes with the 700 U.S. troops in Somalia. Americans are still vulnerable in countries like neighboring Kenya, and the U.S. needs multiple outposts to fight active terrorist groups.<br />Since Islamic State lost its physical caliphate in Syria and Iraq, unstable parts of Africa have become more appealing for jihadists looking to claim territory and plot attacks on the West. ISIS has a small presence in Somalia but the greatest threat is al-Shabaab.<br />The U.S. has launched at least 50 airstrikes this year against the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabaab. Mr. Trump said in a June letter to congressional leaders that some U.S. forces in Somalia also “advise, assist, and accompany regional forces, including Somali and African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) forces, during counterterrorism operations.”</td>

For the next installment we’ll ask, “The 1918 flu pandemic precipitated the roaring ’20s. Do you anticipate the end of Covid-19 having a similar effect?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Jan. 12. The best responses will be published that night.<br />A Tale of Two Pandemics<br />At the beginning of the pandemic, I was concerned that my elderly mother, a hairdresser, continued seeing clients at their homes despite San Francisco’s shelter-in-place orders. After all, we should have been performing our new American duty—staying at home. I pleaded with my mother to close her business, citing the grim data emphasizing increased mortality among elderly populations plastered on every front page. Reluctantly, she sheltered for a week, but soon the income loss became too much.<br />Untimely car and dental troubles depleted the savings we hoped to ration throughout the pandemic. Local and federal aid barely covered three months of living and business expenses. Every $20 haircut quickly became more valuable than our health. The irony was not lost: To survive the pandemic, we had to risk infection.<br />Meanwhile, a supposedly united America preened over its noble self-isolation—even celebrities shared the quarantine struggle, tweeting and streaming from their lavish homes. In actuality, the images populating social media were only half the story. The U.S. experience was divided: Those that possessed adequate financial capital could freely perform their civic duty while working-America compromised their safety for necessities. My low-income family was excluded from visions of a safe, socially distant society, sparking endless debates over stimulus packages that, if substantive, could allow us to shelter.</td>

      <td>Presidents are often at the mercy of unpredictable factors like the business cycle—and pandemics.</td>
      <td>President Trump’s supporters tout the economy’s pre-pandemic performance as evidence that tax cuts and deregulation were making America great again. Detractors look at the data and find these policies wanting or outweighed by the harmful effects of Mr. Trump’s aggressive approach to trade and his isolationist approach to immigration.<br />Both views are misguided. A closer look at the data from the past four years exposes the folly of inferring anything about a presidential administration from how the economy performed. Consider these four lessons:<br />Lesson 1. Presidents often get credit or blame for the economy even though uncontrollable events often matter more than policy. Consider the data for Mr. Trump’s full term. Based on the latest forecasts, the economy will have grown since the beginning of 2017 at an annual rate of about 1.5%, the worst performance of any president since Herbert Hoover. Job growth has been even more dismal, at around three million jobs lost over the past four years.<br />These numbers are obviously meaningless in assessing Mr. Trump’s economic policies given a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. While one could debate the effect on the economy of the president’s mismanagement of the public-health crisis, no one would argue that the GDP and unemployment numbers are reflective of his regulatory reforms or immigration restrictions.<br />The same point applies to other years too, even if the magnitude and causes are not nearly as stark. For example, Mr. Trump’s supporters sometimes credit him with turning the economy around because growth increased from 1.7% in 2016 to 2.3% in 2017. But much of the change is explained by an increase in the pace of exports caused by the 0.7 percentage point pickup in the growth rate of America’s trading partners in 2017. Giving Mr. Trump credit for that “turnaround” makes about as much sense as blaming him for “ruining” the economy with his terrible four-year growth rate.</td>

      <td>Covid-19 worsened a shortage of coins. Capitalism is solving the problem.</td>
      <td>Making change used to be a bit of a joke. A memorable “Saturday Night Live” parody ad in 1988 imagined the “First CityWide Change Bank,” which gave its customers the denominations they want: “If you come to us with a $100 bill, we’re not going to give you 2,000 nickels—unless that meets your particular change needs.”<br />Nowadays getting the change you want is no laughing matter. In many cities making change has become a cash cow for some because of the great U.S. coin shortage. Covid has limited banks hours and shut down the retail businesses that often return coins to circulation. It doesn’t help that Americans have a tendency to dump coins in shoeboxes and never use them again, keeping many in-circulation quarters and pennies sequestered.<br />Nickel-and-diming isn’t going away, even in the digital age—though it’s quarters in particular that are in high demand. Americans still need coins at laundromats, to pump air in their tires at gas stations and for old fashioned parking meters. It’s costly to retrofit coin-operated machines.<br />Don’t panic. Washington is coming to the rescue with its usual turtlelike agility. Officials at the U.S. Mint concede that “sometimes coins are not readily available.” The Mint’s director, David J. Ryder, has asked consumers to “help get coins moving by using exact change when making purchases, taking your coins to financial institutions, or turning them in for cash at coin recycling kiosks.” He says that production of coins is rising now given the demands.<br />As usual, the free market is way ahead of the government. Customers at the Pennsylvania-based Wawa convenience-store chain can change their coins for bills and come away with a free coffee. For one week in July, the Community State Bank in Wisconsin gave a $5 bonus for every $100 worth of coins turned in. My son tells me that San Francisco even has an active secondary market of enterprising entrepreneurs hanging out and serving as, well, “change agents.” A couple of quarters go for as much as a dollar, a roll of 40 for $11 or $12.</td>

Italy as a country ranks low on every index of efficient, accountable governments and effective legal systems. Criminalizing policy disappointments and managerial errors is a symptom of this failure, not its cure.<br />Still, the particulars of the indictment being sought by relatives of early victims will ring bells for many Americans: the shipping of infected persons to nursing homes, failure to test patients who couldn’t be connected to China, failing to order lockdowns sooner, worrying about the potential impact on businesses.<br />The U.S. remains in a similar phase of denial, with every failure related to testing, mask promotion, etc., spun as a missed chance to extinguish Covid altogether. When the reality principle intrudes, here’s suspecting the greatest failure will be the one we are least willing to acknowledge or even understand: It began with our strange reticence to acknowledge the reality of mild (and, as it turned out,  asymptomatic) Covid.<br />Any alert person knew from the get-go that, amid the exigencies of Wuhan, Chinese doctors were failing to detect mild cases, and that thousands of these cases were likely being exported to the world. Whatever the horrors in Wuhan’s hospitals, they happened not because Covid-19 is an extravagantly deadly respiratory infection. They happened because a flu-like disease had been allowed to spread unrecognized for months in an urban population unprotected by any prior immunity or vaccine.<br />Yet it instantly became a U.S. journalistic trope to accuse anyone mentioning the flu of “downplaying” the new disease—downplaying anything being the worst sin in journalism.</td>

On Dec. 18 my blog, The Naked Dollar, revealed a list of race-based demands from 120 Dalton teachers. The Naked Dollar isn’t particularly well-known, but the story quickly went global.<br />The demands read like a manifesto to codify permanently the “oppressed” status of black students and teachers. Among them:<br />• Expand the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to at least 12 staffers. That works out to about one for every 100 students and would cost at least $1.5 million a year. What will they do all day? No doubt ferret out ever subtler racist infractions, real or imagined. The diversity industry needs friction to survive, so it perpetually reworks the definition of racism.<br />• Reroute 50% of contributions to Dalton to the New York public school system. An effective 50% tax rate on donations—the lifeblood of any private school—is a good way of ensuring that alumni close their wallets. How will the school pay all those diversity officers?<br />• Compensate “any Black student or student of color” who participate in antiracism initiatives or has his images used in school publications. Financial favoritism based solely on skin color seems an invitation to a civil-rights lawsuit.</td>

      <td>Biological classiﬁcation conforms perfectly with the patterns of evolutionary relationships evidenced by anatomy, physiology and genetics.</td>
      <td>The great but grumpy biologist J.B.S. Haldane was once asked what evidence would disprove evolution, whereupon he growled: “Fossil rabbits in the Precambrian.” He was referring to the evolutionary fact that complex multicellular creatures came along later than simple, unicellular ones. A bit surprising, perhaps, that one of the foremost evolutionary geneticists of the 20th century immediately reached for a paleontological example, but Haldane’s reply was well-suited for public consumption, because then—as now—when most people thought of evolution, they were likely to conjure images of dinosaur fossils.<br />Donald Prothero is a research associate in vertebrate paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. When I learned he had written a book that examined 25 different discoveries relating to evolution, I assumed that he, like Haldane, would deploy paleontology in making his case. Mr. Prothero’s book is indeed tilted toward examples from the world of ancestral creatures, but, refreshingly, also guides the reader through impressive discoveries in embryology and molecular genetics.<br />“The Story of Evolution in 25 Discoveries” is a parade of self-contained vignettes, often including biographical sketches of the scientists who made and interpreted each discovery. This particular story begins (like everything else) with the big bang, followed by the fascinating tale of how science gradually came to understand the age of the Earth: From biblical literalism; through Lord Kelvin’s famous underestimate, in the 1890s, of 20 million years; to our current understanding of 4.5 billion years. Then comes a whirlwind tour of evolutionary change as it occurs, in real time, among microbes, plants, insects, fish, birds and mammals, obliterating the creationist canard that evolution hasn’t even been witnessed, let alone studied.<br />Some of the most impressive evolutionary stories involve common body plans, technically known as homologies. Thanks to Mr. Prothero, I now know that Aristotle first noticed this widespread phenomenon, of which Darwin wrote: “What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include similar bones, in the same relative positions?” Curious indeed. And strongly suggestive of common descent—or, for anti-evolutionists, of a Creator’s insistence on sticking with the same divine blueprint, or “archetype,” even when other more direct routes should have been available. The Darwinian story provides scientific insight into why homologies occur, whereas the theological story simply reiterates that they occur.<br />And on we go, to the embryonic similarities of otherwise distantly related creatures (“ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny”) and then biogeography (“the sinking of Noah’s Ark”), which shows, among other relevant findings, that the flora and fauna of islands resemble those of nearby continents—a phenomenon that wouldn’t necessarily be expected if each had been a special, independent creation. The story of life continues, detailing how living things within natural categories share those common body plans, or, as Darwin put it, how “organic beings have been found to resemble each other in descending degrees, so that they can be classed in groups under groups.” As a result, instead of being arbitrary, our system of biological classification conforms perfectly with the nested, branching patterns of evolutionary relationships demonstrated by anatomy, physiology and genetics. Moreover, as Mr. Prothero points out, “if life had been specially created rather than evolved, there would be no reason for the molecular systems to reflect this pattern of similarity seen in megascopic features . . . [and] not even Darwin could have dreamed that the genetic code of every cell in your body also shows the evidence of evolution.”</td>

Pandemic Unemployment Assistance is available to the self-employed, gig workers and others not typically eligible for unemployment aid. Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, another federal program that provided up to 13 weeks of additional payments to people who exhausted regular state benefits, will also be extended.<br />Both programs, which were established in response to the coronavirus pandemic, were slated to end Dec. 31.

But Tuesday’s ruling could have the effect of strengthening Republican oversight efforts of the incoming Biden administration.<br />Democrats took control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections and will take over the presidency in January. As a result, a ruling sought by Democrats could give Republican lawmakers a potential new tool for investigating a Democratic administration. And the Biden administration might appeal the ruling in an effort to fend off future GOP information demands.<br />At the center of the case is an obscure 1928 law that has rarely been invoked and that allows any seven members of the Oversight Committee to jointly demand and receive information from the executive branch.

      <td>This adaptation of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels is a comic journey into dystopian ideas.</td>
      <td>Terry Pratchett’s Discworld, the setting of 41 novels by the phenomenally prolific author, was carried on the back of four elephants and a turtle. Its TV incarnation, “The Watch,” is carried by Richard Dormer, Northern Irish actor and “Game of Thrones” veteran. His Commander Sam Vimes, as we see in episode 1, begins his career as an idealistic member of what passes for a police force in the Discworld locale of Ankh-Morpork. But after the emptying of “9321 bottles of booze,” the loss of “68,242 brain cells” and the neutering of law enforcement by the city’s administration, he has become a combination of Popeye and Keith Richards, a scowling, ambling, slightly addlepated detective who will still rise—albeit with considerable difficulty—to the occasion.<br />The advantage of adapting someone as celebrated as Pratchett, who died in 2015, is that his work comes with a built-in fan base. The downside is that said base generally takes its dystopian fantasy very seriously, even work as comic as Pratchett’s. And the fans already have an idea of what it should look like and who should play whom. I am no Pratchett authority, but Mr. Dormer presents a more than acceptable Vimes, with his antic comedic flair, the fractured cowboy rhythms of his gait and Clint Eastwood-inspired cigars that migrate from one side of his mouth to the other as he ponders the great questions of his place and time. Among them: How can the villainous but conflicted Carcer Dun (Samuel Adewunmi) still be alive, when Vimes saw his old friend-cum-foe fall to his death 20 years before? How can he not have aged a day? Is Carcer’s evil plan somehow connected to the magic afoot at Unseen University? And is a missing library book connected to the dragon attacks besieging the city?<br />And what of the City Watch, which Pratchett made the subject of so many novels? Behind every truly memorable act of predictive fantasy lies a serious idea, Pratchett’s being the benighted wisdom of the Ankh-Morpork authorities: Shortly after Vimes joined the Watch, the crime-ridden city decided to recognize and authorize guilds devoted to specific illicit pursuits—a Thieves Guild, an Assassins Guild, a Drug-Pushers Guild, even an Alchemists Guild. As long as the malefactors stayed within their quotas, they were immune to arrest or prosecution. Crime rates actually dropped. But the effect on the Watch was devastating. Dispiriting. Dissipating. Just look at Vimes.<br />The revitalization of the force is effectuated by several near-simultaneous occurrences: The re-emergence of Carcer, of course; the introduction to the Watch of Constable Carrot (Adam Hugill), a fresh-faced and very tall young lad who was raised by dwarves (and tries rather cluelessly to enforce what we’d normally think of as law); and the arrival of Lady Sybil Ramkin (Lara Rossi), a self-possessed and very capable all-around force of justice who rankles Vimes but allies with him to track down Carcer and thwart dragons. Along with them are the mysterious Angua (Marama Corlett), who happens to be a werewolf; the forensics expert Cheery (Jo Eaton-Kent) and, making an occasional cameo appearance, Death himself (Wendell Pierce).<br />The first episode of “The Watch” will play Thursday on AMC+, then again during a two-episode presentation Sunday night at 8 p.m. on BBC America with subsequent episodes materializing on AMC+ and BBC America every Sunday. “The Watch” can’t be taken as seriously as that erstwhile Sunday night staple, “Game of Thrones.” On the upside, it’s a lot more fun.</td>

      <td>The genre, which takes familiar sounds from electronic pop, rap and dance and intensifies them through compression, distortion and exaggeration, broke into the mainstream this year thanks to figures like 100 Gecs and A.G. Cook.</td>
      <td><br /><br />On Dec. 4, electro-pop outfit 100 Gecs released a new holiday-themed song, “Sympathy 4 the Grinch.” The track by the duo Dylan Brady and Laura Les is an impossibly fast and frenetic number that welds the pogoing bounce of ska with the explosive choruses of pop-punk while adding a thick coating of distorted electronics to chirpy, pitched-up vocals. Like many songs by 100 Gecs, it’s polarizing, beloved by fans for its infectious energy but seemingly designed to clear the room of anyone who doesn’t connect to their aesthetic. For those in the latter camp, it’s as annoying as music gets. The genre? It’s usually called hyperpop, and 100 Gecs, along with London producer A.G. Cook, are among its most visible proponents.<br />Hyperpop artists take familiar sounds from electronic pop, rap and dance and intensify them through compression, exaggerating the elements that scanned as “artificial”—programmed drums, Auto-Tuned vocals, the blaring synths found in videogames—to create a cartoonish wall of noise that embraces catchy tunes and memorable hooks. The music zooms between beauty and ugliness, as shimmery melodies collide with mangled instrumentation. The genre tag was originally applied in 2014 to Mr. Cook’s London-based collective and label PC Music, but now reaches much further: In August 2019, streaming platform Spotify, responding to the growing popularity of 100 Gecs, created the hyperpop playlist to highlight this scene. Many of the tracks found in the site’s survey, which currently has almost 150,000 subscribers, are created by teenagers, some as young as 15. It’s a style utterly of this moment that is also difficult to pin down, since it is continuously mutating.<br />Mr. Cook and 100 Gecs had a big year in 2020—as did hyperpop as a whole. The latter released a remix album, “1000 Gecs and the Tree of Clues,” and its two members, individually and collectively, produced music for more than a dozen songs by others, including British singer Charli XCX and bawdy Maryland rapper Rico Nasty. A.G. Cook, who is Charli XCX’s creative director, co-produced and co-wrote her excellent album “How I’m Feeling Now,” released in May; co-wrote and co-produced “Shiver” by Jónsi, frontman of Icelandic dream-rock band Sigur Rós; and issued two albums under his own name, the 49-track “7G” and the concise “Apple.” These are the most visible products of the genre’s current wave, but the scene around the sound goes much deeper and is fueled by the digital culture created by teenagers.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked an effort by Democrats to hold a vote on sending bigger stimulus checks to many Americans, amid growing calls within the GOP for the larger coronavirus-relief payments sought by President Trump.<br />The Kentucky Republican, without committing to hold a vote, said the Senate would address Mr. Trump’s demands to boost the size of the checks to $2,000 from $600 as well as his concerns about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which regulates online speech, and his complaints about purported election fraud. Mr. Trump has blamed fraud for his defeat in the November election, but no significant fraud has emerged.<br />“This week the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus,” Mr. McConnell said, without offering further details. A person familiar with his thinking said Mr. McConnell was considering putting all three items into one bill.<br />The comments came after several Republican senators, including two competing in runoffs soon that will decide control of the Senate, said they would support larger checks.<br />Mr. Trump signed a Covid-19 aid bill into law Sunday but said that the $600 payments in that package were too small. The House then moved to vote to increase the size of the checks to $2,000, which passed Monday night 275 to 134, with 44 Republicans joining almost all Democrats in support.</td>

      <td>A scientific advisory committee had advised lower limits on sugar and alcohol, citing health risks</td>
      <td>The federal government on Tuesday issued new dietary guidelines that keep current allowances for sugar and alcohol consumption unchanged, rejecting recommendations by its scientific advisory committee to make significant cuts.<br />The scientific committee, which was composed of 20 academics and doctors, had recommended cutting the limit for added sugars in the diet to 6% of daily calories from 10% in the current guidelines, citing rising rates of obesity and the link between obesity and health problems like Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The committee also recommended lowering the limit for alcoholic beverages for men to one drink per day from two, matching the guidance for women. It pointed to research linking greater alcohol consumption to a higher risk of death.<br />The new guidelines do include the scientific committee’s recommendation that children under age 2 consume no added sugars at all. This is the first time the guidelines have included recommendations for babies and toddlers. Added sugars are those found in processed foods—in everything from soda to breakfast cereal—as well as honey and sugar itself. They don’t include sugars naturally found in foods like fruit and milk.<br />The dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years, have a wide impact: They shape school lunch programs, mold state and local health-promotion efforts, and influence what food companies produce.<br />The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services reviewed the committee’s recommendations, which were released in July, and decided not to include the lower limits because “the new evidence is not substantial enough to support changes to quantitative recommendations for either added sugars or alcohol,” said Brandon Lipps, deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at the USDA. Mr. Lipps said that the new limits recommended by the scientific committee didn’t meet a “preponderance of the evidence” standard required by law.</td>

The genius of capitalism is that it harnesses human greed to the common good—but greed itself remains a sin. We are reminded of this every time a company uses foreign slave labor to bring down prices or calculates that the lawsuits arising from a safety glitch will cost it less than fixing the danger before anyone gets hurt. It may be good business, but it’s bad living.<br />Capitalism is a boon to humanity, but Marley was right: Mankind remains our business as well, and fairness, honesty and generosity should govern the heart even in the pursuit of profits.<br />It’s a fallen world. No system will fix it. Socialism errs in thinking it can force sinful humans to be what they are not. Capitalism errs in thinking that putting sin to good use will transform it into virtue.

In arguing for an end to lockdowns once vulnerable populations have been vaccinated, their analysis assumes that there is a binary outcome from Covid-19 infections: Either it kills you or it’s no threat at all.<br />Follow-up studies, however, have demonstrated that long-term cognitive and behavioral problems are common, affecting up to 20% of hospitalized survivors and up to 10% of patients with a much milder disease. There are a significant number of Covid patients who are left with chronic respiratory problems, chronic anosmia and cardiac sequela, and these problems aren’t limited to the elderly. The rest of the population is also at risk and must be protected, even if immediate death isn’t likely.<br />Most Americans would love to see the end of our public-health measures, but this is far too soon.

      <td>Chunky clogs have become improbably trendy, with brands like Chanel, Hermès and Louis Vuitton offering high-fashion takes. Here, the footwear’s surprising history, from Dutch workers’ shoes to the Paris runways.</td>
      <td>ON HER FIRST date with Joe Biden, in 1975, Jill Biden, then a college student at the University of Delaware, immediately noticed his shoes. As she later recounted, “I had been dating guys in jeans and clogs and T-shirts, he came to the door and he had a sport coat and loafers and I thought, ‘God, this is never going to work, not in a million years.’”<br />As the incoming first lady observed, the divide between the clogged and the unclogged can seem vast. On the one side, bohemian aplomb; on the other, an uptight suspicion of any shoe that shares an etymology with plumbing mishaps. But reader, she married him. Is the gap really as yawning as we assume it to be?<br />It’s certainly narrowing, especially now that both mass-market and luxury brands are bringing new designs to eager consumers. In September,  Crocs  released a collaboration with the Puerto Rican rap star Bad Bunny that sold out in 16 minutes. And this season, Hermès, which is better known for handbags with yearslong waiting lists, is releasing its anticipated iteration; priced at $990, it’s in the new category of luxury clog. The Hermès design comes on the heels of  Louis Vuitton ,  Gucci, Dior and Chanel versions, not to mention more affordable offerings from Everlane and Gap, all of which are late to the party compared with No. 6, the New York brand whose earthy pairs made wood-soled shoes a fashionable class signifier 15 years ago.<br />This clog blossoming suggests not just a high-fashion takeover of a shoe formerly associated with artisans and hippies, but its newly broad appeal.<br />As with everything this year, the growing visibility of clogs has been shaped by the pandemic. With less of a reason to wear formal shoes, either because of unemployment or closed offices, clogs’ slip-on, slip-off ease is understandably appealing. And perhaps because their comfort and support makes them a favorite of health care workers, 2020’s superheroes, they’ve taken on an associative feel-good glow.</td>

The late researcher of the complex genetic and environmental factors relating to intelligence believed, as Mr. Riley puts it, that “dodging difficult topics was intellectual cowardice.” That brings to mind cancel culture, the apotheosis of intellectual cowardice. Does the need to shut down discussion, out of fear or plain rage, have its roots in genetic or environmental factors? We should study that, too.<br />Tom O’Hare<br />Charlestown, R.I.<br /><br />Mr. Riley quotes Flynn’s remark: “To advise scholars that they should not systemically investigate race and IQ seems to me to raise the question of what we are afraid of.” The Trump era has provided a bit of clarity on how one might begin to answer that. We aren’t afraid of the evidence or the truth about racial differences. We are afraid of individuals who wield great power and demonstrate little appreciation of the finer points. Do we need to go public with findings that we know will be used to substantiate distorted conclusions?</td>

That would mark its second straight monthly decline bigger than 14% and largest monthly drop since January. Prices are more than 25% below a peak hit in late October and have suffered four daily drops of at least 6% this month, a period of outsize volatility punctuated by Monday’s 8.5% slide and Tuesday’s recovery.<br />Natural-gas prices often gyrate in the winter because demand in the season is driven by how frequently people use their heaters. The power-generation fuel is used as the primary source of heat for roughly half of the homes in the U.S., so speculative investors often position for demand and prices to rally in the colder months of the year.<br />Recent weather forecasts show warmer temperatures spreading across the U.S. in the next few weeks, though, driving an unwind of bullish bets and fresh price declines.<br />“It is becoming increasingly apparent that the market will need to gradually discount another warmer-than-normal winter,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.</td>

      <td>As this difficult year slinks to its unlamented end, I have felt compelled to ask myself: What do I believe so much that if necessary I will fight for it the way America’s revolutionaries did, with their lives, fortunes and sacred honor? And how do my beliefs compare with the widening spectrum of beliefs about America?<br />Many populist conservatives believe that America was at its best in the 1950s, when men were men and women were women, manufacturing dominated the economy, white Christians dominated the culture, patriotism was unquestioned, and divisive social issues hadn’t entered the public agenda.<br />I believe in America the way liberals do—not as perfect, but capable of being made “more perfect.” I believe in America the way Abraham Lincoln did at Gettysburg when he promised a new birth of freedom built on the foundation of the Declaration of Independence. I believe in America the way Martin Luther King Jr. did when he rooted his dream in the American dream and denominated the unpaid promissory note to black Americans in the principles of the declaration. I believe in America the way that Bill Clinton did when he declared in his 1993 inaugural address, “There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.”<br />There are those who don’t believe that America ever was, or ever can be, worthy of devotion. On the far left, some argue that America is irredeemably marked by slavery, conquest and genocide. They are right that we should seek to understand and to teach history fully, without glossing over its brutalities. But it is one thing to be honest about the past, another to use it as proof of a national original sin that can never be expunged. At the end of this road is despair—or revolution.<br />On the far right there are those who give America’s original sin a different name—liberalism. They claim that the Declaration of Independence inspired by John Locke has led us down the primrose path. A polity based on individual rights liberates appetites and destroys morality, they say, and the civil law created to protect liberty becomes the source of its destruction. At the end of this road lies theocracy, which could only be achieved at the point of the sword, or withdrawal into faith communities whose existence is protected by the polity their members scorn.</td>

      <td>Prices won’t break out of the $40 to $50 range until consumption gets back to normal sometime next year.</td>
      <td>When will oil sustainably break out of the “Virus Alley”—that $40 to $50 band that has held oil prices in check for months? That’s Question No. 1 going into 2021 for an oil industry that has dramatically retrenched and investors who have abandoned the sector because of a lack of returns. It will also determine when U.S. shale recovers from its pandemic malaise and resumes growth.<br />Only a year ago prospects looked pretty good. Optimism about the world economy at the beginning of 2020 had a barrel of Brent crude at $70. Then came a pandemic that was in almost no company’s—or country’s—emergency plans. The general view of something called SARS-CoV-2 was initially conditioned by the experience of SARS-1 in the early 2000s, which had about 8,000 cases world-wide and fewer than 800 deaths.<br />But by March the highly transmissible coronavirus was precipitating a world-wide shutdown, the worst global recession in 74 years, and the constriction of movement by both car and plane. That led to a plummeting of global oil demand and a price collapse that saw prices go “negative,” or below zero, as producers paid people to take their oil away because storage tanks were filled to overflowing.<br />The rebound from negative prices and the stabilization of the market was made possible by unprecedented production cuts by the group that calls itself OPEC-plus—the 13 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and a group of 10 other producing nations led by Russia. That U.S.-brokered agreement got oil prices up into the $40 to $50 range of Virus Alley, blocked at one end by the virus and at the other by the uncertain prospect for vaccines. Now that vaccines are here, prices have moved to the $50 end of the alley. But will they rise into that higher band of $50 to $65 that will enable companies to start spending and attract investors?<br />In the short term, such a rebound will be challenged. The resurgence of the virus is again leading to shutdowns, reducing economic activities. A clear indication of this was provided by the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., when  IHS Markit ’s  weekly survey showed that gasoline demand had fallen to a level last seen in 1997.

While this will cancel out the 4% decline of 2020, small business and other sectors will be left devastated.</td>

      <td>Activist hedge fund says it has taken significant stake in Intel, calls for changes to preserve U.S. edge in semiconductor industry</td>
      <td>Activist hedge fund Third Point LLC is urging  Intel Corp.  to consider strategic changes after a year in which the U.S. semiconductor giant suffered new product delays and lost its rank as America’s most valued chip company.<br />Third Point said in a letter Tuesday to Intel Chairman Omar Ishrak, “We suggest the board retain a reputable investment advisor to evaluate strategic alternatives, including whether Intel should remain an integrated device manufacturer and the potential divestment of certain failed acquisitions.”<br />Intel said it “welcomes input from all investors regarding enhanced shareholder value. In that spirit, we look forward to engaging with Third Point LLC on their ideas towards that goal.”<br />Intel, which both designs and builds its own chips, said this year that it would consider outsourcing the manufacturing of some of its most advanced chips. The company is expected to decide soon where it will make future generations of processors.<br />Third Point said Intel risks triggering broader implications for U.S. tech supremacy if it fails to act. “Without immediate change at Intel, we fear that America’s access to leading-edge semiconductor supply will erode, forcing the U.S. to rely more heavily on a geopolitically unstable East Asia to power everything from PCs to data centers to critical infrastructure and more,” the letter says.</td>

Mr. Parks is now seeking unspecified damages, according to the complaint, over allegations including false arrest, civil-rights violations and emotional distress.<br />The New Jersey state police, Woodbridge police and prosecutors in Middlesex County didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. New York state police officials, whom the Woodbridge police sent photographs for facial-recognition comparison, said their records showed they didn’t provide any leads in the case.<br />Police increasingly have adopted facial-recognition software into their crime-solving arsenal. Advocates say it is an effective new technology that has helped solve many cases, but the tools have drawn growing scrutiny in law enforcement in part because of the potential consequences of a false match.</td>

Lawmakers are calling for further investigation. The companies say it was above board.<br />The Wall Street Journal viewed part of a recent unredacted draft version of the lawsuit, which elaborates on allegations in the redacted complaint filed in a Texas federal district court.<br />Ten Republican attorneys general, led by Texas’ Ken Paxton, say Google gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a ubiquitous tool for allocating advertising space across the web. This and other conduct by Google, they allege in the final lawsuit, harms competition and deprives “advertisers, publishers and consumers of improved quality, greater transparency, increased output and/or lower prices.”<br />Previously unreported details from the draft, including contract terms and company documents, shed light on the legal battle ahead and the relationship between two tech giants who have called each other competitors even as they hold an ever-widening share of the digital advertising market.<br />A Google spokeswoman declined to comment on specific terms of the deal. She said the states’ “complaint misrepresents this agreement, as it does many other aspects of our ad tech business. We look forward to making our case in court.”</td>

American will also alert passengers if they are suddenly scheduled to fly on a MAX due to a schedule change, she said.<br />David Seymour, American’s chief operating officer, said gradually reintroducing the MAX would help build customer confidence and give passengers flexibility if they initially prefer to fly on other aircraft.

      <td>Vermont is a tough place to visit this winter, but if you don’t want to socialize, here’s where to quarantine cozily</td>
      <td>HIDING OUT in Vermont’s snowy Green Mountains presents some challenges during Covid-times—but that’s the allure. The state’s strict regulations, wide-open spaces and intelligent epidemic management have led to one of the country’s lowest rates of infection. A tough place to visit, Vermont requires all out-of-state travelers to quarantine for seven days if they have a negative Covid test or 14 days without one—either before they leave home or after arrival. The state also limits locals and visitors alike from gathering with people from other households. Lodgings and restaurants and even ski resorts, however, are open at limited capacity.<br />The obstacles have kept most visitors at home, but if you don’t mind quarantining and don’t want to socialize, Vermont can be your own private snow globe this winter. And if you’re a skier, 50% lower capacity on peak weekends on the mountains means 50% fewer people scraping off the powder. We recommend these three, extra-safe lodging strategies, all focused on southern Vermont counties with even lower Covid rates than the rest of the state. Strap on your snowshoes.<br />The owners of the Homestyle Hotel Inn + Restaurant in Ludlow recently took over a motel in an 1830s building across the street and turned it into the Main + Mountain Bar and Motel. The transformed hostelry’s second-floor accommodations feature cool hues of white and gray, with live-edge headboards and white subway tile.<br />Covid-safety bonus: The motel has contactless check-in and pickup from the bar downstairs, and every room’s doors and windows open to the outside. Best of all, this fall the owners closed the hotel part of their property across the street and turned its former guest rooms into private dining rooms for the Homestyle Restaurant.<br />Surroundings: The homey mill town of Ludlow has emerged as one of Southern Vermont’s best dining destinations, and is about a five-minute drive from the access road to Okemo Mountain.</td>

That could open a door for big state banks or other types of government-controlled entities to buy into the firm to help beef up its capital base, the officials and advisers say.<br />China’s national pension fund, China Development Bank and  China International Capital Corp. , the country’s top state-owned investment bank, are already investors in Ant.<br />Mr. Ma, China’s richest person, has helped define China’s new economy with the two companies he founded—Ant and its e-commerce affiliate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Their businesses span payment services, online retail, cloud computing, wealth management and lending. Separately, Alibaba is facing an antitrust probe that could also lead to an overhaul of its business and asset divestitures.</td>

      <td>From free tests to the shielding of care homes, Tübingen has pioneered tools later deployed elsewhere to minimize pandemic casualties</td>
      <td>Concern is growing in Europe over access to vaccine doses during the winter wave of Covid-19. But one town claims to have found a formula to prevent high mortality without a draconian lockdown.<br />The southern German city of Tübingen was hit hard by the virus in the spring, but measures such as widely available testing and even subsidizing taxi rides have since managed to protect the elderly, who make up most of the fatalities.<br />At the peak of the first wave in April, the town had 70 Covid-19 patients in its biggest hospital—out of 89,000 inhabitants—including 33 in intensive care, forcing doctors to cancel elective surgery. Now, at the height of the far more devastating current surge, patients number just 35, many transferred from other regions. Fifteen of them are in intensive care, of whom fewer than half are Tübingen residents. The hospital hasn’t canceled non-urgent surgery.<br />Local authorities say such numbers are no accident. The town, they point out, started earlier than most German municipalities in carrying out frequent Covid-19 tests on care-home staff, residents and visitors. It subsidizes taxi rides for those over age 65 so they don’t have to use public transit. Younger residents are discouraged from shopping between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. so as to avoid seniors having to mingle with people who are more likely to carry the virus without symptoms.<br />Tübingen’s pandemic policy has so far cost it half a million euros, all financed through the town‘s budget. A week of the current lockdown, with restaurants and all nonessential stores closed, costs the German economy and the state between €27 billion and €57 billion in lost output and subsidies, according to estimates by the Ifo Institute, a government-funded economics think tank in Munich.</td>

Over the past two weeks, authorities in Dalian have tallied up 35 symptomatic carriers, including the two reported Tuesday. Hundreds of flights into and out of Shenyang and Dalian have been suspended in recent days to prevent the further spread of the disease.</td>

While convenient for some and for others the only way to see the movie, the creators of the production describe streaming as a regrettable medium for superhero films.<br />Star Gal Gadot, who plays the main character in “Wonder Woman 1984,” said in an interview the streaming experience for viewers is unlikely to match going to the movie theater. “Cinemas have the ability to give fans the 360 experience,” she said.<br />Director Patty Jenkins even shot the film with special IMAX cameras hoping to amplify the scale of the 2½ hour action-packed spectacle.<br />The producer of “Wonder Woman 1984,” Charles Roven, who has made a career out of producing big-budget franchise films, also said the big screen is key to superhero movies’ success with fans. But, in Hollywood, where the genre has dominated the business for more than a decade, their allure is also about profitability, he said. The longtime producer isn’t convinced WarnerMedia’s plan to debut his films, “Wonder Woman 1984” and next year’s “The Suicide Squad” in theaters and on streaming service HBO Max simultaneously, makes economic sense.<br />“If you’re making a movie that costs $200 million plus and you want it to be viable,” it needs a big theatrical debut, said Mr. Roven. “People want the spectacle so that’s why you spend the money. They come to see it. That generates the profits.”</td>

      <td>The use of Snapchat, Instagram or TikTok can fray or strengthen ties, depending on whether pals communicate the same way</td>
      <td>For many teenagers, the past year has been a blur of online classes, remote extracurriculars and virtual holiday celebrations. The shift to small-screen living might not seem like a major adjustment for teens already glued to their devices, but it has reshaped what is most critical to them: their friendships.<br />I interviewed five teenagers across the country to learn what nearly a year of living virtually has been like for them. A common theme is that their tech choices—or those of their parents and even their friends’ parents—dictate with whom they have stayed in touch. That was the case, to some extent, before the Covid-19 pandemic, but it has become starker in the months since many in-person interactions came to an abrupt end in March.<br />Nearly half of the 849 teens surveyed by Common Sense Media late last spring reported feeling less connected than usual with their friends after schools closed. Students who had once talked to certain friends every day in the school cafeteria or in the hallway suddenly lost touch with all but their closest pals once schools shut down, unless they happened to be connected on the same social-media apps. Some even lost touch with their best friends because of the technology they do or don’t use.<br />Here is how these teenagers say technology has dictated their friendships in the months since the pandemic altered their social interactions.<br />Ian Pase, a 16-year-old from Anaheim Hills, Calif., who has attended his public school remotely since the spring, prefers Snapchat to keep in touch with friends. “There are a lot of people who I’m not superclose friends with who I liked talking to in class but we don’t have each other’s social media so we can’t really communicate anymore,” he said. “I also have friends who don’t have Snapchat because their parents don’t allow them to have it. They use Instagram to text each other so there’s kind of a disconnect.”</td>

      <td>Trump’s veto of defense authorization bill becomes a focus in Senate runoffs</td>
      <td>President-elect Joe Biden’s narrow victory in Georgia last month was driven in part by shifts toward the Democratic ticket in a collection of nine counties with strong ties to the military.<br />As a group, the military counties backed President Trump. However, his victory margin was 7.8 percentage points less than in 2016, a greater movement than the 5.3-point swing toward Mr. Biden statewide. And while voter turnout grew by less than 21% across Georgia, the number of votes cast in military counties rose by nearly 26%.<br />Now, Mr. Trump’s veto of the annual defense policy bill is adding new complications to GOP voter turnout efforts ahead of Jan. 5 Georgia runoff elections that will determine control of the U.S. Senate. Mr. Trump said he rejected the bill due to provisions that would remove Confederate names of military bases, limit his ability to withdraw troops abroad and didn’t remove legal protections for internet platforms he says squelch conservative voices.<br />The $740.5 billion bill passed the House and Senate with bipartisan majorities, including support from Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, the two Georgia Republicans defending their seats in the runoffs.<br />The two senators must now decide whether to support a president who could help boost Republican turnout in the runoffs or back a veto override of the bill. The legislation authorizes $168 million in military construction projects in Georgia, funds for educating military children and enhanced hazard pay and bonuses for certain military personnel, among other things.</td>

Investors include Tokyo-based trading company  Mitsubishi Corp.<br />The government-owned Japan Bank for International Cooperation said Tuesday it would lend slightly more than a third of the total $1.767 billion in financing for the project. It said the project would “contribute to economic development in Vietnam through the stable supply of electricity.” Japanese commercial banks and the Export-Import Bank of Korea are also providing financing.<br />The project has become a flashpoint in the debate over whether rich nations should continue supporting coal-fired power in developing nations with growing electricity demand.<br />Critics of the project include a group of international investors and Japan’s own environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, who is considered a potential future prime minister. In January, Mr. Koizumi said the project couldn’t gain the understanding of the international community.</td>

      <td>U.S. doesn’t need to reach full herd immunity before public spaces can begin phased reopenings</td>
      <td>As 2021 arrives, there is one question that matters most: How soon can we escape the Covid-19 pandemic?<br />The answer is as elusive as it is pressing. It is unknown what level of natural infection and immunization is needed to reach herd immunity in the population. It is also unknown how many people in the U.S. have already contracted the coronavirus. Whatever the answer to the question, trillions of dollars in economic activity are at stake, as are millions of livelihoods.<br />By some metrics, things have never been worse: U.S. hospitalizations are at a record high, and public-health experts continue to warn that things will get worse before they get better. With more than 19 million confirmed cases in the U.S., achieving herd immunity is a ways off. After all, that figure accounts for just 6% of the U.S. population. And with daily new cases still reaching well into the hundreds of thousands, it seems unrealistic to hope for Covid-19 to vanish in the new year. Worse, public polling has suggested that some adults won’t take a vaccine if offered.<br />However, the outlook for the year ahead is much brighter than those grim figures would suggest. Eradicating Covid-19 shouldn’t be necessary to begin a gradual return to schools, restaurants, concert halls and arenas.<br />While the challenge of vaccinating a large portion of the country is significant, it might not be as daunting as it first seems. There are roughly 333 million people in the U.S., but not everyone will need a vaccine right away. For starters, about 19 million people have a confirmed case. The true number of cases is likely much higher: Many patients with confirmed cases do not show symptoms, and some people who experience symptoms consistent with Covid-19 choose not to seek medical attention. Children make up a large share of the U.S. population, and there is little evidence that schools are hot spots for spreading the virus. That suggests vaccinating children shouldn’t be a prerequisite for returning to normal. So far, the shots available in the U.S. are only authorized for patients 16 and older.</td>

The fund managed by Blumberg’s American Ventures division will be the company’s fifth distressed fund since 1992 but the first one it has raised in the past decade, according to Philip Blumberg, founder and chief executive.<br />“In this market we expect discounts of up to 35%,” Mr. Blumberg predicted. “It will be the best buying opportunity since 2010.”<br />Numerous other investment companies also think that historic opportunities await because of the havoc wrought to the commercial property market by the pandemic. Their thinking is that prices will plummet because fear of contagion has kept people away from malls, airports and office buildings.<br />Other companies that have raised or are raising distressed funds include  KKR & Co. ,  Kayne Anderson Real Estate and Terra Capital Partners. Heavyweights like  Brookfield Asset Management  and Starwood Capital Group are sitting on billions of dollars in cash and capital commitments that could be used for that purpose.</td>

      <td>Competing bids to Salesforce’s offer didn’t emerge, even after news of firms’ merger talks surfaced</td>
      <td>One of the largest tech deals this year also shows why there might be a lot fewer of them in the future.<br />Salesforce.com ’s  $27.7 billion acquisition of  Slack Technologies ,  announced this month, was the largest to date for the hyperacquisitive cloud-software provider, as well as the second-largest deal so far in the software space—behind IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat in 2018, according to Dealogic. The high price Salesforce paid—representing 26 times Slack’s projected revenue for the next 12 months—led many to speculate that the company faced competition on the deal.<br />But that wasn’t the case. According to a regulatory filing last week detailing the background of the merger, Slack Chief Executive Stewart Butterfield said he received “informal messages” from representatives of two large, publicly traded U.S. technology companies on Nov. 25—the day The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks between the two companies. But those reps only “expressed a desire to discuss the market rumors,” according to Mr. Butterfield. No actual competing bids emerged.<br />That isn’t a surprise. Besides the rather generous valuation Salesforce was already offering, the most likely competition would have come from tech giants that are already under intense government scrutiny.  Amazon.com  and Alphabet’s Google in particular operate large cloud businesses that could have benefited from the addition of Slack’s popular messaging platform. But Google is now the subject of several antitrust lawsuits from the federal government and most states, while Amazon is dealing with its own government probes into how it competes in the retail and cloud-services sectors.<br />Microsoft ,  while not under the same level of scrutiny, was also an unlikely bidder. The software giant has become Slack’s primary competitor with the popularity of its Teams platform, which has been reporting superior growth numbers to Slack of late. Having its own history with government crackdowns would also likely make Microsoft think twice before spending top dollar to take out a competitor. Other tech giants will be making similar calculations for the foreseeable future.</td>

Energy storage is a solution investors should watch in 2021, even if it doesn’t yet lend itself to stock picking.<br />Governments around the world greatly raised their decarbonization ambitions this year. There is great uncertainty about how their promises will be delivered, but almost all scenarios involve massive building of solar and wind farms. As their share of power production grows, it will become crucial to bridge the times when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine.<br />Building wind and solar together can reduce the gaps, while gas-fueled power plants can provide a nonrenewable backup. Also helpful are demand-side response agreements—when big power consumers promise to cut their usage during pinch points in exchange for lower prices.<br />Even with all these methods, though, it will be necessary to store excess electricity for use in lean times.</td>

      <td>A handful of startups and larger firms are experimenting with nationally competitive, nonlocalized pay. Is the extra cost worth the added employee goodwill?</td>
      <td>Tech workers and employers alike are beginning to question location-focused pay scales. A handful of companies are moving to abandon them altogether.<br />In setting pay without regard for location, tech companies including Reddit Inc. and  Zillow Group Inc.  are making a potentially expensive gamble to retain talent and gain a hiring edge. The move can entail maintaining relatively high salaries of employees who are relocating, and adopting a revised scale for new hires. Though it is early, the move challenges a long-held, but not universal, notion that where people live should determine what they make.<br />Some big tech firms including  Facebook Inc.  were clear early on in the pandemic that people moving away from the Bay Area to less expensive cities would see a pay cut. Payment platform Stripe Inc. offered one-time bonuses for workers who moved out of San Francisco, Seattle or New York—and agreed to a pay cut of up to 10%.<br />But a pay cut for any reason can be bad for worker morale, said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis who researches pay determination. “Employers really have to do a bit of a dance to justify it to workers,” he said.<br />Workers considering more flexible work scenarios are themselves divided. A November survey of 600 tech workers by the job-search platform Indeed found that 60% of respondents would be willing to take a pay cut to work remotely permanently while 40% said they wouldn’t.</td>

      <td>A burst of central bank bond-buying has revived a debate about quantitative easing’s potential fiscal cost</td>
      <td>The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and  Bank of Japan  have collectively expanded their balance sheets by around $8 trillion in 2020. It took them almost eight years to achieve the same growth following the seizure of global financial markets in September 2008.<br />That burst of bond-buying has revived a debate about quantitative easing, and how it might impose a fiscal cost on the countries pursuing it. But the circumstances in which to worry look fairly limited.<br />The logic goes like this: When the central bank buys bonds from commercial banks, the proceeds are credited to those banks in the form of additional reserves parked at the monetary authority. The central bank then pays interest on those reserves. In periods like the past decade when the market value of bond portfolios has swelled, that has been profitable for central banks.<br />But if interest rates were to rise, all that might reverse: The central bank would be paying higher interest on its reserves—very short-term liabilities—and the value of its long-maturity bondholdings would decline. That might leave the central bank requiring assistance from the fiscal authority to be recapitalized, or at the very least cut short the profit central banks return to their finance ministries.<br />The important factor is the circumstances in which major developed economies might face an unexpected rise in inflation. There is a great deal we still don’t really know about inflationary pressure. But if it came from an economy genuinely running hot, it is very likely that tax revenues would be rising anyway, more than offsetting any expense rising from central bank losses.</td>

Professional investors such as Stanley Druckenmiller and companies like Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. began investing this year. Companies like Robinhood Markets Inc. and  PayPal Holdings Inc.  allowed their customers to buy and sell bitcoin.<br />Despite those inroads, industry watchers say bitcoin must gain traction as a form of payment to become more ubiquitous. Spending it isn’t easy. Few merchants accept it, and many people are still unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency. Its use is generally limited to high-end purchases, like those at Mr. Dossa’s dealership.<br />Bitcoin, introduced in 2008, was designed to operate as a form of electronic cash, allowing users to exchange value as quickly and cheaply as sending an email. In practice, its adoption was hampered by several factors. In early years, it was difficult for average users to operate the digital wallets that stored their holdings. Many of the companies that tried accepting bitcoin in 2014 and 2015, including  Expedia Group Inc.  and Dell Inc., later quietly dropped it.</td>

      <td>Office-building landlords are hoping that the massive Covid-19 vaccination campaign launched in the U.S. this month will lead to millions of people returning to workplaces in 2021 after spending most of the pandemic working from home.<br />But it isn’t going to be soon. Rather, a widespread return probably won’t take place until the late spring or early summer of 2021 when enough people have been vaccinated in the U.S. for the population to come close to achieving “herd immunity,” according to public-health professionals and executives in the real-estate industry.<br />Moreover, the office world that will be reinhabited next year will look a lot different from the one that was hurriedly vacated in mid-March when the fear of Covid-19 sent much of the U.S. labor force into lockdown. During an initial transition period, office density likely will be low, workers will wear masks and a range of other safety precautions will be followed.<br />Long-term changes in the workplace will continue for years. Working from home and other remote locations, which became a necessity during the pandemic, will likely remain a major part of the workplace, employers and real-estate executives say.<br />Businesses that are highly competitive for top talent will likely begin opening small satellite offices in metropolitan areas and offering employees the option of working there, at home or in centralized headquarters—or a combination of the three. Design firm Gensler already is working with a half dozen Fortune 100 companies on such “hub-and-spoke” strategies, as they are becoming known in the office industry, said Joseph Brancato, co-chairman of the firm.</td>

But with a single announcement, the Federal Aviation Administration is formally pivoting from approving case-by-case exemptions to setting broad safety standards the industry has long sought.<br />The new approach, replacing stringent protections that currently bar practically all home-delivery options, go into effect in two months, but some requirements are likely to take years to implement.<br />The detailed regulations, which total more than 700 pages and parts of which had been in the works since the Obama administration, also aim to address concerns related to law enforcement, national security and privacy protection.<br />“They get us closer to the day when we will more routinely see drone operations such as the delivery of packages,” FAA chief Steve Dickson said in a written statement accompanying the rules. Mr. Dickson has told colleagues he intends to stay on under the Biden administration, according to people involved in the conversations, to fill out the remainder of his five-year term ending in 2024.

      <td>German business software giant SAP paid around $8 billion for the startup two years ago, in one of the biggest acquisitions ever</td>
      <td>German business software giant  SAP SE  said it would return Qualtrics International Inc. to public markets, in a listing expected to value the business at least 50% above what it paid for the startup two years ago.<br />SAP said in November 2018 it planned to buy the customer-relationship management software vendor shortly before Qualtrics was about to go public. SAP paid around $8 billion, one of its largest acquisitions ever, in a bid to keep pace with rivals such as  Salesforce.com Inc.<br />Provo, Utah-based Qualtrics, in a regulatory filing Monday, set an initial price range of between $20 and $24, which would value the company on a fully diluted basis between $12 billion and $14.4 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. Pricing can change based on investor feedback until the day before a company’s stock starts trading.<br />SAP CEO Christian Klein in July said the company would take Qualtrics public while remaining the majority shareholder. The deal, he said, would allow Qualtrics to better pursue non-SAP business opportunities.<br />Qualtrics shares will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “XM.” SAP will retain a controlling stake in Qualtrics following the planned IPO, including all of the company’s Class B shares that give it extra voting rights.</td>

      <td>Maybe the GOP will stand up on trade once Joe Biden is picking winners.</td>
      <td>President Trump will soon leave town, but his tariffs may be staying. Joe Biden hasn’t been exactly clear about his trade policy, so perhaps it’s time to point out one unsightly effect of the Trump tariffs: expanding the D.C. swamp.<br />Republicans who cheered when the Trump Administration picked winners and losers might soon find out what it’s like when the Biden Administration does it. Take Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who lobbied last year for a company in his state, SM Products, to get tariff exclusions on imported Chinese-manufactured saw blades.<br />In a Sept. 19, 2019, letter to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), four members of Missouri’s congressional delegation, including Mr. Hawley, argued that “it would not be beneficial to impair a small American company that does not have the financial resources or alternative supply chain options.” Since SM’s costs and prices are “locked in many months before delivery,” the legislators wrote, the Missouri company “must absorb the entire cost of the tariffs,” likely precluding profitability.<br />Join the club. Countless American businesses were in a similar situation. Most weren’t lucky enough—or connected enough—to have a U.S. Senator pleading their case. Yet you might be surprised. As Mr. Trump’s tariffs began to bite, Congress sent hundreds of letters to the USTR, supporting specific tariff exclusions. The examples here are taken from about 100 pages of correspondence from 2019, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request.<br />Mark Meadows, now the White House chief of staff, urged tariff exclusions in a Nov. 22, 2019, letter, aiming to prevent “severe economic harm to an important business in my district.” He said the USTR had “my wholehearted support in your work to combat Chinese intellectual property theft and industrial espionage.” But given how fast Mr. Trump’s tariffs were kicking in, “it was not possible for Fairfield Chair to develop a new relationship with a new supplier of similar quality.” Please, please don’t tax these beech wood components from China.</td>

      <td>The President writes a $2,000 check to make Democrats the majority.</td>
      <td>President Trump finally signed the Covid-19 relief bill and 2021 budget on Sunday night, but not before giving a big assist to Democratic hopes of gaining control of the Senate in the two runoff elections on Jan. 5. Current GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is left this week trying to undo the significant political damage.<br />Mr. Trump had been insisting that Congress write checks of $2,000 each to most Americans, rather than the $600 in the bill. His own Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, negotiated the $600 figure. But after the bill passed, Mr. Trump decided that wasn’t enough.<br />Never mind that the $2,000 would go to tens of millions of Americans who have kept their jobs and maintained their incomes during the pandemic. It would also add some $350 billion or more to a federal deficit that is already into the trillions of dollars. The economy won’t benefit since the recipients aren’t going to change their behavior knowing it’s merely a one-time check.<br />Senate Republicans oppose the $2,000 for these sound reasons, but Mr. Trump has put them in a political spot. Democrats immediately joined Mr. Trump’s call for the $2,000, and on Monday House Democrats were expected to vote to approve the extra cash.<br />That leaves Mr. McConnell with a tough call of barring a vote as Democrats bang away in TV ads in Georgia against GOP incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Or he can hold a vote, which would split the GOP caucus and upset fiscally conservative voters. Either way it amounts to a Donald Trump in-kind contribution to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden.</td>

      <td>Bill bans evictions statewide for 60 days, and then tenants unable to pay because of the pandemic can file to prevent or suspend proceedings</td>
      <td>New York is poised to enact wide-reaching protections for tenants suffering from hardship due to the coronavirus pandemic, with lawmakers expected to place a moratorium on many evictions until May 1.<br />New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said Monday he would sign the bill, a move cheered by tenant advocates who said the state would be enacting one of the strictest eviction moratoriums in the country. Opponents said the legislation didn’t do enough to protect landlords and could prevent struggling building owners from paying their taxes.<br />The bill effectively bans all evictions statewide for 60 days, including those already in motion. After that, tenants who are unable to pay their rent because of the coronavirus pandemic can file paperwork to prevent or suspend eviction proceedings until May 1. Households where a member is at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 are also protected under the bill.<br />“You do not solve a public health crisis, you do not solve an economic crisis, by kicking people out on the street,” said state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, a Democrat from Brooklyn. “You solve it by keeping people in their homes.”<br />The state Senate voted Monday afternoon to approve the legislation, and the Assembly continued its debate into the evening.</td>
