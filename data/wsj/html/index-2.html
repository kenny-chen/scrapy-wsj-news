      <td>Lawsuit adds one of the U.S. chicken industry’s biggest customers to expanding litigation that alleges long-running collusion among poultry processors</td>
      <td>Chick-fil-A Inc., the leading U.S. chicken chain, sued major poultry producers, accusing them of price-fixing that the Atlanta-based company says led to inflated prices for billions of dollars worth of its chicken purchases.<br />The chicken-sandwich giant alleged in a lawsuit filed Friday in a federal court in Illinois that top chicken suppliers, including  Tyson Foods Inc.,   Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. ,  Sanderson Farms Inc.  and Perdue Farms Inc., coordinated pricing for meat supplies and collectively reduced production to push up prices. Chick-fil-A is seeking unspecified damages and to recoup legal fees, according to the lawsuit.<br />A Tyson spokesman said Chick-fil-A’s claims were unfounded and that Tyson would defend against them. A Perdue spokeswoman and a Sanderson Farms spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for Pilgrim’s didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />The lawsuit adds one of the U.S. poultry industry’s biggest customers to a four-year legal battle over alleged collusion among companies that produce the bulk of the roughly 37 billion pounds of chicken consumed annually in the U.S.<br />Major supermarket operators and food-service distributors have filed civil suits alleging anticompetitive behavior, and this year the U.S. Justice Department indicted senior chicken-industry executives and sales officials on criminal charges of bid-rigging and price-fixing. The defendants have pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges, and major chicken companies are contesting the civil-court claims.</td>

      <td>Without traditional campus life and classes, some students postpone education; ‘You need to have a plan,’ a counselor says, but even part-time jobs are hard to find</td>
      <td>When New York University moved many classes online amid the pandemic, a group of third-year film and drama students at the school took things into their own hands. Reluctant to tackle a semester of what they labeled “Zoom Shakespeare” and “Zoom Treasure Island,” they began researching where to live and work together inexpensively. “We wanted to create an environment where we [could] riff off each other,” said Marina Fess, an acting major.<br />The students organized a creative collective in Vermont without oversight or advice from professors or NYU, which isn’t awarding academic credit for the three-month stint.<br />Many students elsewhere also took action, choosing either to postpone college or interrupt their studies to work as proofreaders, long-distance tutors, campaign volunteers, researchers and DoorDash delivery people. Some are pursuing passions like drone piloting.<br />During Covid, the decision to take a gap year or semester before or during college is complicated. With many school policies in flux, tuition refunds or credits aren’t always a given and students who have secured scholarships may be hesitant to defer. At some schools, students who take time off may risk losing the chance to enroll whenever they like, and could have to resubmit financial aid applications the following academic year. Finding gap-year activities also is harder now. Even part-time jobs can be tough to land and the pandemic has suspended or limited many traditional pursuits, like travel or international volunteer programs.<br />Jill Tipograph, co-founder of Early Stage Careers, a career coaching service for college students and young professionals, says both high-school seniors who postpone college and mid-college students putting their education on pause should commit to activities that develop their skills and maturity. She suggests that they map out their gap period and how to structure their days. “You need to have a plan,” Ms. Tipograph says. “You can’t just take time off.”</td>

      <td>Democrats devise magic ‘multipliers’ to justify spending, but the returns never show.</td>
      <td>Wait for it . . . any day now . . . get ready for the “multipliers.” You know, the idea that a government dollar spent magically turns into multiple dollars in the economy. We ought to start hearing that silly word again as the lame-duck coronavirus stimulus negotiations kick in. Expect more multiplier mumbo jumbo as the Biden administration begins its tax-and-spend fiesta.<br />Let’s face it, the Democrats haven’t had a believable economic messenger since Robert Rubin during the Clinton administration. Since then they’ve presented a cast of characters—Larry Summers, Mr. Biden’s adviser Jared Bernstein, and lately Elizabeth Warren—who bend themselves into pretzels to justify higher spending and then higher taxes.<br />The  New York Times  described this trend during the early days of the Obama administration. The financial crisis team of Jason Furman, Tim Geithner and Mr. Summers were “carrying around this list of multipliers” taken from a chart by Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. Every dollar spent extending unemployment insurance benefits would, the fairy tale went, boost the economy by $1.64. Sadly, a dollar in reduced corporate taxes would boost the economy by only 30 cents. But cheer up, every dollar spent on food stamps would spur a $1.73 increase in gross domestic product. Mr. Zandi called it “bang for the buck”—the proverbial free lunch. It’s more like “dud for the dollar” because it didn’t work. It never does. Multipliers are a canard, a Keynesian conceit.<br />The economy grew after the Great Recession, as it does after every recession. The stimulus didn’t stimulate. Shovel-ready projects weren’t ready. Many complained that the stimulus wasn’t big enough. More hooey. The Obama administration’s high taxes and heaps of regulation held the economy back. Is spending driving today’s recovery? Think back to the Heroes Act 2.0, Nancy Pelosi’s $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Economic growth in the third quarter of 2020 was 33% as lockdowns were lifted, despite—or because of—that gigantic stimulus package not becoming law.<br />The theory of multipliers is based on the Keynesian view that poorer consumers tend to spend a large amount of increased income, and the rich less so. But multipliers are half a story. Someone has to put up the original money that allegedly gets multiplied, taking it away from the private sector and negating whatever dwindling chain of transactions are hypothesized. It’s like two waves canceling each other out—you can’t just do the math on the additive public wave and ignore subtracting the private. This demand-side theory omits the principle of productivity, the real driver of economic growth and prosperity.</td>

      <td>Thousands of angry protesters gathered on Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn, N.Y. Camped out in front of Chuck Schumer’s apartment building, the mob used bullhorns and signs to jeer the Senate minority leader.<br />The activist left was sending a message to Democrats: President Trump was unacceptable. They accused Mr. Schumer and his colleagues of being soft. Signs urged him to “show some spine” and to resist “by any means necessary.”<br />Nearly every Democratic senator eventually complied. Oregon’s Sen. Jeff Merkley vowed to obstruct the president’s nominees purely as “a protest” against Republicans. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut promised to “shatter precedent” to stymie nominations.<br />The result was unprecedented. As had been tradition, Presidents Clinton and Obama had nearly all of their cabinet confirmed in January. Mr. Clinton had 13 out of 14; Mr. Obama, 11 out of 15. Senate Democrats made sure Mr. Trump had only three.<br />Because the Democrats abolished the filibuster for confirmation votes in 2013, they couldn’t ultimately block any appointment without Republican support. But nominees faced a bombardment of endless “questions for the record.” Democrats voted en bloc against nominees in committee. They consistently refused to consent to routine floor votes, forcing the use of the cloture procedure, then made sure to use every minute of the 30 hours of postcloture debate to delay the confirmation vote as long as they could.</td>

      <td>Regarding your editorial “Can Republicans Regroup on Health Care?” (Nov. 30): That the party needs to address its biggest policy vulnerability correctly underscores the need of a more competitive health-care system but you miss the most important problem: Most health-care-provider markets in the U.S. are highly concentrated.<br />There is now overwhelming academic research that concludes the rise in prices charged by hospitals and doctors is due to reduced competition and not increased volume or quality. California data provide an example. Between 2008 and 2018 the volume of hospital care purchased by commercial insurers declined by 15% while their payments (and prices) to hospitals increased by 283%. Much of this increase is due to the growing power of large systems. In many markets across the U.S., insurance companies have no choice but to contract with dominant health systems—at above-market rates—to offer health plans that meet network adequacy requirements demanded by regulators and employers.<br />We need limited but targeted regulations to restore competition to provider markets if the GOP model of limited government control can work. Otherwise the public, which doesn’t currently support a government-run system, will see no other option.<br />Prof. Glenn Melnick<br />University of Southern California</td>

      <td>MANAMA, Bahrain—Saudi and Israeli dignitaries traded blunt remarks over longstanding issues that divide them Sunday during a regional security forum held against the backdrop of U.S.-brokered normalization deals between the Jewish state and Gulf Arab neighbors.<br />The exchange came two weeks after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secretly met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to seek assurances that a normalization deal between the longtime rivals was in reach. Saudi Arabia has denied the meeting took place, but Israel hasn’t. The Wall Street Journal reported that Prince Mohammed pulled back from a deal during the encounter, largely because of the U.S. election result.<br />In a fiery address at the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal condemned Israel as the last Western colonizer of the Middle East. He disparaged its claims of upholding human rights and enumerated decades of crimes committed against the Palestinians.<br />“They’re demolishing homes as they wish and they assassinate whomever they want, and yet the Israeli Knesset passed a law that defines the citizenship of Israel as exclusively Jewish, denying the non-Jewish inhabitants of Israel of equal rights under the law,” Prince Turki said. “What kind of democracy is that?”<br />He prefaced his remarks by saying they represented his personal view, but as a senior prince who advises the Saudi king, his comments are closely monitored as a policy bellwether. Following criticism of Palestinian leaders by another senior Saudi royal in October, Prince Turki’s comments reveal the divergent views at the top echelons of the secretive kingdom toward warming relations with Israel.</td>

Will Trump Deliver?” (op-ed, Nov. 27): Prof. Blinder chants the left’s mantra that the economic recovery is in peril unless President Trump and Senate Republicans can work with House Democrats to pass another stimulus package. It’s hard to believe, however, that the economy could survive and thrive during the state lockdowns preferred by Democrats in the last eight months, but it cannot scrape by for eight weeks until Bidenomics arrives and the spending floodgates reopen.<br />If times are so tough in several blue or purple states, why did Democrats in the House reject the GOP offer in October of a $1.8 trillion stimulus package? The governments that allegedly were in decent fiscal health before the pandemic were, in fact, living on the edge after decades of imprudent underfunding of pension and health benefits for government workers.<br />Some type of federal bailout of beleaguered state and local governments surely is on the horizon. It is a rare politician in either party who doesn’t love bringing home the pork, and the 2022 election campaigning will unofficially kick off shortly after Inauguration Day. Democrats’ pleas for more money now may reflect a desire to get a couple more trillion dollars of pre-Biden spending out of the way (and blamed on president President Trump), so that there is a clean slate for a real spending surge when Joe Biden is in the White House. As it is, the national economy is strong, holiday spending appears to be robust, states that are strapped can muddle through and Sen.

Democrats made defending the Affordable Care Act a top issue in Supreme Court confirmation hearings weeks before the election and promised repeatedly on the campaign trail to protect the law.<br />Democrats took the House majority in 2018 after centering their campaigns on the Trump administration’s efforts to chip away at the health law. But after the party lost multiple House seats and underperformed in several Senate races this year, some former candidates and strategists who worked on 2020 campaigns say Democrats should have focused more on people who were losing their jobs and struggling to pay rent during the pandemic.<br />“I think that the message needs to shift more towards the economy,” said Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who lost her race in November in a Miami-Dade County district that swung toward President Trump after voting overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in 2016.<br />“There’s a lot of fear that many people here will not be able to get back to work, that they don’t know where they’re going to be able to find their next paycheck,” she said.</td>

IAC, under Chairman Barry Diller, is pushing back, saying such a move would devastate a key part of its business.<br />The  Alphabet Inc.  unit so far hasn’t acted on the internal recommendation of its Chrome trust and safety team regarding IAC in part because the two are rivals in some categories and because the search giant’s executives, including Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker, are concerned that penalties could be viewed as anticompetitive, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Google was sued in October by federal prosecutors for allegedly operating an antitrust monopoly in search. State officials are wrapping up their own investigations, which may result in additional charges. Google has said it would contest any allegations in court.<br />The search company’s concern with IAC centers on browser extensions, which are external applications that run inside Google’s Chrome browser.

      <td>From free video calling to a $2,495 stationary bike, here’s a look at how companies used pricing to respond to the coronavirus crisis</td>
      <td>Free Zoom, $13 unlimited  Walmart  delivery, a $30  Disney  movie, a $399 iPhone and a $2,495 Peloton bike: This year, companies in tech and other industries used the lever of pricing in ways that managed the pandemic’s obstacles or even capitalized on its opportunities.<br />Ordinarily, an economic downturn causes a decrease in demand for many products and services. Yet the Covid-19 pandemic’s widely varying impact on different corners of the economy tested traditional pricing approaches. Companies played up conveniences, knocked down barriers and offered new services and new choices—with mixed results. Here’s a look at examples of intriguing price moves this year:<br />“Mulan,” a $200 million live-action remake years in the works, was supposed to have a big theatrical release—but the coronavirus had other plans. Instead,  Walt Disney Co.  charged $30 for at-home “premier access” to the title, for people already paying $6.99 a month for a Disney+ subscription. After three months, “Mulan” became available on the service for no extra charge.<br />In the film industry, it’s common to charge a higher price for early viewing, reducing the price as time goes on. For some, the “Mulan” price was a bargain. Between popcorn, drinks and tickets, a family outing to the theaters easily exceeds that. For others, $30 was too high.<br />During its opening weekend, “Mulan” appeared as No. 10 on Nielsen’s U.S. streaming charts, with 525 million minutes streamed. The list was otherwise dominated by  Netflix Inc.  and topped by the streaming giant’s “Cobra Kai” series, which drew an estimated 2.2 billion streaming minutes.</td>

      <td>Sweden’s Covid-19 experiment is over.<br />After a late autumn surge in infections led to rising hospitalizations and deaths, the government has abandoned its attempt—unique among Western nations—to combat the pandemic through voluntary measures.<br />Like other Europeans, Swedes are now heading into the winter facing restrictions ranging from a ban on large gatherings to curbs on alcohol sales and school closures—all aimed at preventing the country’s health system from being swamped by patients and capping what is already among the highest per capita death tolls in the world.<br />The clampdown, which started last month, put an end to a hands-off approach that had made the Scandinavian nation a prime example in the often heated global debate between opponents and champions of pandemic lockdowns.<br />Admirers of the Swedish way as far as the U.S. hailed its benefit to the economy and its respect for fundamental freedoms. Critics called it a gamble with human lives, especially those of the most vulnerable. With its shift in strategy, the government is now siding with those advocating at least some mandatory restrictions.</td>

Companies from energy giant  Royal Dutch Shell  PLC to Australian fuel company  Ampol Ltd.  are closing facilities or considering doing so as they reckon with anemic fuel demand and growing competition from newer, more efficient fuel-making facilities in Asia and the Middle East.<br />Eleven refineries from the U.S. to Japan have said this year that they intended to close. Three have announced partial shutdowns, and at least another five are on the chopping block, according to analytics firm  IHS Markit .<br />The thinning out is part of a global shift in fuel-making power away from wealthier countries, where demand is in long-term decline and there are many older, smaller refineries. Newer, larger facilities in countries such as China generally are able to produce fuels for less, benefitting from growing regional markets and shipping their products overseas.<br />More than 1.7 million barrels a day worth of refining capacity in countries such as the U.S. and Japan has disappeared or is poised to do so in 2020 and 2021, as China, India and the Middle East add more than 2.2 million barrels a day worth of fuel-making capability, according to the International Energy Agency.</td>

      <td>Republican hopefuls will need to lay the groundwork for potential campaigns of their own without alienating the president and his supporters</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Trump’s public and private musings about running again in 2024 are scrambling the calculus for the large field of fellow Republicans considering bids.<br />Most hopefuls have been quick to show deference. But it’s unclear whether Mr. Trump, who refuses to concede his loss to President-elect Joe Biden, will follow through, and rivals either way will likely seek ways to remain viable. Prospective GOP candidates don’t want to risk alienating Mr. Trump’s base by appearing to push him aside, but they also don’t want to be left unprepared if he decides not to run.<br />“For the last 20 years everyone who has run for president has always started off pretending like they weren’t. You can still do that with the possibility of Trump running again,” said Republican strategist Todd Harris. The 2024 election, he added, “could be the first time loyalty to Trump and political ambition are put on a collision course.”<br />Mr. Trump—who managed to get more than 74 million votes in his losing effort this year—demonstrated his grip on the party base with Saturday’s rally in Georgia for two senators locked in tight runoff elections. “Four more years, four more years,” a shoulder-to-shoulder crowd chanted. He is raising millions of dollars for a newly formed political committee that can fund future campaign activity.<br />“Trump blocks out the sun on all of the other prospective candidates,” said Kevin Madden, a former adviser to Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and now a senator from Utah. “You show up in New Hampshire and talk about the future of the GOP, you immediately put a target on your back with Trump and his followers. Are you willing to take that fight on?”</td>

      <td>Shares have won big this year, not primarily because earnings went up but because the cost of money went down almost to zero</td>
      <td>Many investors are still bewildered that the shock of 2020’s economy gave rise to the awe that is this year’s stock market. The puzzle gets worse: Stocks have done better than their norm of the past century even if you invested at the high in 2007 and held through both the worst financial crisis and worst pandemic in 100 years. What on Earth is going on?<br />The answer should give pause to investors who plan to hold for the long run. Stocks have won big, not primarily because earnings went up but because the cost of money went down almost to zero. A repeat in the next decade is almost inconceivable, which means future returns are likely to be pedestrian, at best.<br />To put some numbers on it, an investor who bought the S&P 500 in October 2007, stayed calm as Lehman Brothers went bust, and ignored the repeated panics and the pandemic made an annualized 7.3% above inflation, including dividends. That is far better than the 6.5% annualized real return on U.S. stocks from 1900 to the start of this year calculated by academics Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton for  Credit Suisse .  It is on a par with the postwar returns of 7.4% over inflation annually from 1950 to the start of the year, despite the great financial crisis and the pandemic, the worst hits to the economy since the second world war.<br />This year is a fine example of why: In 2020, falling earnings coincided with much higher valuations of future earnings, as lower interest rates and bond yields made stocks look more attractive.<br />Unpack that thought and the implication is that we are paying more for the same future stream of income. That is, stocks offer pretty much the same prospective profits and dividends that they did before, but at a higher price. Sure, some biotechnology and videoconferencing stocks have had their growth accelerated by the pandemic, but shareholders of airlines, shopping-mall owners and travel companies will be using a big chunk of future profits to pay for the debt needed to survive 2020. The market assumption is that 2020 is a write-off but that S&P earnings in 2021 will be about 4% above last year’s, and 2022’s will reach roughly where 2021’s were expected to be before the pandemic hit.</td>

They used that experience to expand from the purchase of a single derelict site nearby into one of the world’s largest independent gas-station operators, with over 6,000 sites across Europe, and more recently in Australia and the U.S.<br />They took advantage as big oil companies sold off underperforming gas stations, snapping up sites in the U.K. and then in Europe. Their playbook: doubling down on higher-margin food, selling fresh and packaged groceries and franchising some of the world’s most recognizable fast-food brands.<br />Now the Issa brothers are looking to repeat the trick in the U.S. EG Group—the business they own along with private-equity firm TDR Capital—struck its sixth American acquisition in just over two years in November.<br />But as the brothers explore a stock-market listing for the business, they are facing scrutiny over corporate governance and the debt amassed to fund the rapid expansion.

Chinese authorities last month stopped Ant from raising more than $34 billion in record-breaking initial public offerings in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and are planning to implement rules that would sharply curb the company’s growth ambitions.<br />Back in 2018, the Hangzhou-based startup approached banks with a proposition that many lenders found hard to resist. Ant offered to match them with users of Alipay, its ubiquitous payments app used by hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens and many of the country’s small businesses.<br />The banks were asked to supply funds for short-term online loans and Ant would connect them with borrowers, provide them with some credit-risk metrics, and channel payments back to the lenders. In return, Ant collected fees for helping to originate the loans, while banks earned interest income on the debt.<br />Around 100 banks, ranging from national lenders to small rural banks, signed up for the opportunity to expand their balance sheets by partnering with Ant. At the end of June, Chinese banks and trust companies had the equivalent of around $230 billion in outstanding loans to consumers who borrowed through Alipay, according to calculations by The Wall Street Journal based on Ant’s disclosures.</td>

Alongside scientific research, one goal is to figure out what kind of places might be suitable someday for mineral extraction.<br />On Dec. 1, China said it landed a probe on the moon in humanity’s first bid since the 1970s to return lunar rocks to the Earth. The U.S. has its own asteroid mission that recently grabbed as much as 2 pounds of material from the asteroid Bennu, with return to Earth scheduled in 2023.<br />Japan’s Hayabusa 2 probe blasted off six years ago on its journey to Ryugu, a boxy miniplanet about a half-mile across that circles the sun mostly between the orbits of Earth and Mars. Last year, the probe collected two samples from the asteroid, including one from beneath the surface after firing a projectile to create an artificial crater.<br />After a journey of more than 3.2 billion miles, Hayabusa 2 flew by Earth this weekend and released a capsule that Japanese officials hope will contain at least 0.1 gram of asteroid material, the equivalent of a few grains of rice. The capsule sped through Earth’s atmosphere at 7 miles a second before extending a parachute that allowed it to glide down to a landing spot in Australia on Sunday morning local time.</td>

      <td>The words we use to praise and insult dishes have changed dramatically over time.</td>
      <td>Not so long ago, if you had invited someone over for a meal of something charred, they would have assumed that you were apologizing for burning dinner. Yet now, “charred” is desirable. It signifies food that is robust, deeply flavored and cooked in a modern way, whether on a hot skillet or grill or roasted in an oven.<br />Browsing cookbooks the other day, I noticed that many of the words we now use to praise dishes once would have been considered insults. I found recipes that call for ingredients to be “crushed,” “smashed,” “fermented,” “vinegared” and “sour,” as well as “burned” or “charred.” There was charred corn, charred broccoli, hot charred cherry tomatoes with cold yogurt, every kind of charred meat, charred tofu and even charred butter with lemons.<br />Tastes change from one generation to the next, and this is as true of food words as it is of foods themselves. Such shifts in vocabulary reflect wider social trends. The vogue for charred vegetables and fermented everything goes along with new concerns about health, as well as more globalized attitudes to cooking. We have shaken off the tired old belief that French is the only language in the kitchen. The Mexican “sofrito” and the Indian “tadka” have taken their rightful place alongside the French “mirepoix”—all of them referring to a preparation of finely chopped, flavorsome vegetables.<br />Back in the 1990s, American grocery stores would place a premium on foods that were “imported,” meaning foreign and therefore glamorous. Now it is the “local,” the “sustainable” and the “seed-to-table” that are prized. Cooks of earlier generations might have seen a smashed carrot salad as a failed carrot purée, but we now see such rough-hewn dishes as healthy and natural.<br />Often our attachment to food words is a proxy for craving certain flavors and textures. I am old enough to remember a time when the greatest compliment you could pay a cake was to say it was “light as a feather.” In Gloria Pitzer’s “Better Cookery Book” from 1983, a Yellow Colonial Cake is described as “Perfect, yellow, light-as-a-feather layer cake.” But today’s baking books are just as likely to praise a cake for being “dense,” particularly if it is a chocolate loaf cake.</td>

One day in 2015, I was in the shower and the word Ferrari came to me. I thought, “That’s weird.” Day after day for a week, I would get in the shower and the word Ferrari would come to me. Finally, I went to the dealership in Mill Valley, Calif. I went through all the cars and when I saw the 458, I said, “I want to test-drive that one.” They said, “OK, come back tomorrow and we’ll have one you can drive.”<br />The next day one of the guys there pulled this car out and we went up a hill. He hit the gas. In the passenger seat, I felt the G-force and it was one of the most thrilling things I ever felt in my life. When I got behind the wheel, I punched the gas, and it was even more thrilling. That was it: I had to have this car.<br /><br />Ordering a new Ferrari is not like ordering other cars. I spent two weeks going back and forth, designing it. At first I wanted it all chocolate color, exterior and interior. They talked me out of it. I ended up selecting titanium paint, a chocolate-colored suede interior, and a black dashboard that would not distract from the driving experience. I put carbon fiber everywhere I could. I chose yellow brake calipers, which matched the yellow in the Ferrari logo. (It is the traditional color of founder Enzo Ferrari’s hometown—Modena, Italy.) All these decisions and more made my car unique—one of one, built that year.</td>

The result: getting seed funding has always been harder for Silicon Valley outsiders, including startups from outside New York City and the Bay Area, and founders from minority backgrounds. The numbers are particularly stark for Black founders: Between 2013 and 2017, 77% of founders of active U.S. startups that had received venture capital were white. Only 1% were Black.<br />But something unexpected is happening during this chaotic year: Owing to a convergence of factors, some Black founders of tech startups are finding that it’s easier to attract investment.<br />For starters, pandemic lockdowns have made investors easier to reach. Many are now more accessible through Zoom and social media. This has eliminated not just physical barriers but also psychological barriers to funding companies outside of startup hubs like New York City and the Bay Area.<br />Black founders also say that the killing of George Floyd, subsequent protests and the broader cultural movement that has ensued have caused the VC industry to reckon with its track record of funding minority founders. Many companies and investors—including SoftBank, Google, PayPal, and Andreessen Horowitz—have announced diversity-focused funds and started cutting checks from them.<br />“Never did we think 2020 would be a tipping point for ShearShare,” says Courtney Caldwell, co-founder of the company sometimes known as “Hairbnb,” which uses a marketplace approach to match hairstylists with salon owners.</td>

      <td>MEXICO CITY—The October arrest in the U.S. of Mexico’s former defense minister sparked anger among senior Mexican military officers, a key factor that led President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to push hard for the release of the influential general.<br />Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos, who served as defense minister from 2012 to 2018, was arrested for allegedly taking bribes to protect the operations of a drug cartel. The surprise arrest in Los Angeles, as the general and his wife were starting a California vacation, stirred an outcry among high-ranking Mexican officers.<br />The military is a key ally of the Mexican president, one he can ill afford to alienate. Top officers were angered that Gen. Cienfuegos had been arrested by U.S. authorities outside Mexico and would be judged in the U.S., two senior Mexican government officials said. Officers saw this as a humiliation and a violation of Mexico’s sovereignty. Others also believed the general was innocent.<br />The arrest awakened nationalist anti-American passions in the armed forces, said former Foreign Minister Jorge Castañeda.<br />“This is a hard blow to Mexico’s image and for its armed forces,” an active-duty general wrote to Mr. Castañeda in a WhatsApp message, according to Mr. Castañeda. “Cienfuegos is innocent,” the active-duty general added. “This is a totally abusive and arbitrary action by the U.S. I consider it an insult to Mexico.”</td>

Khaldoon al-Mubarak wanted to know how bad things could get.<br />Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son assured the chief executive of Mubadala Investment Co. that a fund housing $15 billion of Mubadala’s money was diverse enough to withstand the storm. BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink explained to Mr. Mubarak how government stimulus could boost the U.S. economy. Egon Durban, co-CEO of private-equity firm Silver Lake, argued the market had become too bearish and was overlooking an eventual vaccine.<br />“In those early days I was on the phone all the time,” said the 44-year-old Mr. Mubarak, a Tufts University graduate who sports a crew cut and is as comfortable in a suit as a traditional Emirati thobe. “For me, it was instrumental in really forming a view.”<br />The view that emerged was that the world would eventually bounce back from the pandemic and that an unprecedented crisis would bring big opportunities. Mr. Mubarak staked billions on that belief, committing to new investment partnerships with U.S. private-equity giants  Apollo Global Management Inc.  and Silver Lake while making new bets on everything from  Alphabet Inc.’s  self-driving car effort to a firm working on a coronavirus vaccine trial.<br />He made this push while many of his peers pulled back. Mubadala  invested more than $11 billion this year as of December 1, according to consulting firm Global SWF, up 46% from the entirety of last year. That compares with a 36% decline in new capital deployed by all sovereign funds over the same period. A larger United Arab Emirates fund, the $500 billion Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, is among those that invested less, according to Global SWF. ADIA declined to comment.</td>

Now, those politicians will be in a better position to do something about it.<br />Buybacks have been a particularly hot issue since 2018 when, under terms of the Trump administration’s corporate tax cuts, big U.S. companies repatriated billions of dollars that had been stashed for years in overseas tax havens. In the resulting binge, the dollar value of big companies’ repurchases of their own stock shot up 55% to a record $806 billion. Buyback foes complained that such repurchases enriched shareholders, generally wealthier Americans, at the expense of workers, new plants and research, and broader economic development<br />Buybacks are down about 30% this year, as companies conserve cash to ride out the pandemic. But the issue remains prominent for Democrats who just took the White House and retained the House as they plan their legislative and regulatory agenda.<br />With that in mind, here is what investors need to know about buybacks—and why they are controversial.</td>

      <td>Whether it’s for a backyard ‘minimony’ or a public-park ‘micro-wedding,’ ‘corona brides’ are getting creative with jumpsuits, short dresses and other options that Grandma would hate</td>
      <td>IN MY FAMILY, we classify life’s challenges into two tiers: problems and “prombles.” A problem is a broken bone; a “promble” is a broken pencil. In the omnishambles of the coronavirus pandemic, being forced to reimagine one’s wedding is a mere ‘promble.’ But that doesn’t make it feel any less gutting to the many couples worldwide who have either postponed or drastically scaled back their nuptials this year. Elaborate country-club weddings and tropical destination events were downsized to “minimonies” (tiny weddings), “micromonies” (another word for tiny weddings) and intimate backyard affairs. Grandma stayed home. Banquets became slices of pizza. And over-the-top poofy dresses chosen by committee became jumpsuits and minidresses purchased online, worn with white face masks.<br />By the time I was enlisted to officiate my friend Alice Newell-Hanson’s New York City wedding in September, it had gone from being a 180-person warehouse rager to a four-person affair under a tree among the pigeons and hookah-puffers of Washington Square Park. The bride’s original dress—a floor-length embroidered gown fit for a very chic Renaissance Faire—was replaced by a shorter white Proenza Schouler dress with a leather buttoned belt. In the same amount of time it took me to become a reverend of the American Marriage Ministries (five minutes), the bride bought her new dress online. “Knowing we weren’t going to have tons of family there gave me a new sense of freedom. The dress didn’t have to be something that my relatives would ‘get,’” Alice said, adding that her family back in England was particularly mystified by the belt. She has no regrets: “I think I’m going to like what I wore better in the long run because it really just felt like me.”<br />Many “corona brides” (as they call themselves on social media) I spoke to expressed a similar silver-lining sentiment. Few mourn the extravagant confections designed to make an entrance on a curving staircase. Perhaps the minimal, less exorbitant gown is a cooler, more contemporary look anyway. Just look at Lily Allen, the British singer who wed this fall on a small scale in Las Vegas. Her short, tailored Dior dress looked just right—even iconic—for her wedding pictures at the burger joint In N’ Out.<br />Dyanna Villaluna Volek, 36, a government affairs manager for the San Francisco International Airport, had planned a 150-person gala at the airport’s museum for this November. While she originally bought multiple “very traditional” vintage options to choose from to fit the event’s 1920s theme, she ended up renting a simpler gown from Rent the Runway to wear with an unorthodox  Etsy  cape for her revised tiny public-park ceremony. When the nuptials had come and gone, she went to a  FedEx  shop to return the dress and remembers thinking, “Shouldn’t I feel more connected to my wedding dress?” But she realized, “I think that was like the whole ceremony in and of itself, we mourned what was supposed to be for a little bit and then we let it go and then something better came along.”<br />Should you choose to buy rather than rent a gown, one advantage of going for a simpler design is that it can be worn again. Vanessa Cocchiaro, a Paris-based Australian designer with a thriving bridal business, makes wearable pieces like jumpsuits and slip dresses, most of which sell for under $1,000. While she’s watched friends who design couture-level clothing close their businesses, she said her affordable and modern dresses are flying out the door, purchased for intimate Covid-era ceremonies. An Australian client of Ms. Cocchiaro’s was originally going to wear “a princess dress” but when she reconceived her wedding as a humbler affair, opted instead for one of Ms. Cocchiaro’s short frocks. The designer explained, “She said she still felt bridal-ish but beautiful and it’s something that she’s going to wear again and again.”</td>

      <td>Consumer-product makers are under pressure to pitch in as customers and lawmakers pay more attention to plastic waste</td>
      <td>Who should pay to recycle discarded cereal boxes, drinks bottles and detergent containers?<br />The makers of such products have long fought efforts to make them pay for the cost of dealing with packaging waste. Now, trade groups that represent companies like  Procter & Gamble Co.  and  PepsiCo Inc.  are softening that stance, as consumers become more concerned about plastic waste and municipalities struggle to cover the costs of their recycling programs.<br />Federal and state lawmakers in the U.S. are proposing bills to push companies to pick up the tab for managing empty soda bottles, candy wrappers, cereal boxes and other packaging they use. Such rules could help pay for curbside collection and sorting infrastructure, and spur companies to design packaging that is easier to recycle, lawmakers say.<br />Charging companies “puts the financial burden of plastic pollution back on the manufacturers who generate it and profit from it,” said Sen. Tom Udall (D., N.M.), who this year introduced a bill that would make companies pay to collect and process waste. Several states including Massachusetts, New York and Washington are considering similar measures.<br />Packaging has become more complex of late, often being a mix of materials such as aluminum layered with different plastics to make baby and pet-food pouches. Most recycling facilities can’t handle these. Also, a 2018 ban on waste imports by China, historically the biggest buyer of used plastic from the U.S., created a glut of recyclables with nowhere to go. Ninety two recycling programs have been eliminated in the U.S. since late 2017, according to the Recycling Partnership, a nonprofit.</td>

      <td>The films collected in a new Blu-ray set are precious records of the Yiddish cinema that was virtually extinguished by the Holocaust.</td>
      <td><br /><br />Technologies come and go in the film world, but rarely whole cultures. That’s one reason why movies in Yiddish prove so fascinating. They are fundamentally different from other objects of bygone days. Whereas, say, silent pictures from Denmark or Japan document the past, there remains an unbroken link between such movies and new ones produced in those countries today. Not so for Yiddish films, which are truly relics from a vanished world. Equally significant, Yiddish movies are distinguished by their extra-nationality. They were produced not in a single country, but rather on two continents an ocean apart, primarily in the U.S. and Poland.<br />The American debut of a collection of recently restored Yiddish films offers a precious peek into what has largely been a void for most of us. “The Jewish Soul” contains 10 pictures on five Blu-rays and marks another significant collaboration between the Paris-based Lobster Films, which managed the difficult reconstructions and initially released them in France, and Kino Lorber, which added bonus materials and is distributing the package stateside. (The set is also available for purchase, and several titles can be rented, digitally via the Kino Now platform at kinonow.com.)<br />Yiddish cinema’s great tragedy was its short life. It didn’t really take off until the mid-1930s, and the form was virtually extinguished by the Holocaust, though filming in America limped along till roughly 1950. There had been silent films—“The Golem” (1915), from Germany, is perhaps the best example—that dealt with Jewish themes and characters, but the absence of spoken dialogue left them bereft of a vital aspect: the sound of Yiddish itself, the innately musical, profoundly emotional and irrepressibly funny language of Ashkenazi Jewry.</td>

      <td>An exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art shows how artists used the most elemental of creative practices—drawing—to reinvent their world.</td>
      <td>New York<br />Because drawing is more modest in scale and intimate in its mode of address than many of the other forms of contemporary art being shown today, it is easy to overlook or take for granted. Kudos to the Museum of Modern Art, then, for thrusting it into the conversation with “Degree Zero: Drawing at Midcentury.” The show covers the years 1948-61, when in the aftermath of World War II artists felt art itself had to be reinvented from the ground up and chose that most fundamental of processes, drawing, for the task. At every turn “Degree Zero” upends our expectations to tell us something new about what was going on at that time.<br />The approximately 80 works here were all drawn from MoMA’s collection by Associate Curator Samantha Friedman, the show’s organizer, and have been installed with sufficient space between them to permit safe viewing at close quarters. They were made by artists from Latin America, Asia and Africa in addition to Europe and North America, until recently the museum’s almost exclusive focus. So along with MoMA pantheon members like Henri Matisse and Jackson Pollock, we encounter the likes of Jean Dubuffet, Willys de Castro, Otto Piene and Yayoi Kusama, as well as names likely to be as new to the general public as they were to me. This broad-gauge approach is nothing less than revelatory, forcing us to think differently about certain exalted reputations as a result.<br />The show’s theme is poignantly captured in an untitled charcoal and chalk drawing by the French abstractionist Hans Hartung from 1960. It consists of closely abutting dark, black vertical marks of almost uniform length. On the one hand it reads as a kind of existentialist manifesto, “I draw, therefore I am.” Yet at the same time, the individual parts seem to be in the process of resolving themselves into an image—art coming into being before our eyes.<br />Among the unforgettable discoveries is Sonja Sekula (1918-1963), who divided her time between the U.S. and her native Switzerland, where, the label tells us, she underwent treatment for mental illness. “The Voyage” (1956) is a jewel-like, ink-and-watercolor work organized into a loose grid. Each of its panels is a different color and obsessively filled with a dense web of lines and minuscule circles within which the only recognizable image is that of a ship. It is a mesmerizing, vertiginous record of the journey through a charged interior landscape that demands—and rewards—prolonged, close scrutiny. A pity, then, that it’s hung almost too high to be seen properly.</td>

Such exposure could have protected them from getting sick from Covid-19 or lessened the severity of the disease.<br />Others doubt that the immune systems of people in the region differ from people in the rest of the world in any systematic way. They suspect cultural factors and, in some countries, government policies such as tightly enforced quarantines are playing the main role.<br />Whatever the case, doctors agree that some explanation is needed for why Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore all have experienced at most a few thousand new SARS-CoV-2 infections a day, even during the current surge. That compares with tens of thousands of daily cases in many European nations and more than 150,000 new cases on many days in the U.S.<br />Yasuhiro Suzuki has pondered the question as the highest-ranking doctor in the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare’s medical corps until his retirement in August.</td>

      <td>The Trump administration said Friday it will allow most borrowers with federal student loans to suspend their monthly payments until Jan. 31, 2021, extending by a month an earlier reprieve designed to support households during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The decision, announced by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, will help most of the 42 million Americans who owe federal student loans.<br />“The coronavirus pandemic has presented challenges for many students and borrowers, and this temporary pause in payments will help those who have been impacted,” Mrs. DeVos said. She added that Congress, rather than the administration, should determine what, if any, additional relief should be provided to student-loan borrowers.<br />The move will allow tens of millions of borrowers to go another month without having to pay hundreds—and in some cases, thousands—of dollars in student-loan payments. Instead, taxpayers will cover the cost of foregone interest on those loans.<br />Most borrowers with federal student loans haven’t had to make payments since March, when the pandemic led swaths of the economy to close.</td>

      <td>Order concludes three-year legal battle over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal judge in Brooklyn on Friday ordered the Trump administration to fully restore the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, meaning the government will once more have to accept new applications for the program that protects immigrants living in the U.S. since childhood without legal permission.<br />The order concludes a three-year legal battle over the Trump administration’s attempt to kill DACA, which the Supreme Court ruled it did improperly because it didn’t follow the proper procedure for federal policy-making.<br />That means, for the first time since September 2017, new applicants who weren’t previously eligible, typically because they were too young, may now apply for the program. The Friday ruling also asks the government to issue two-year permits for it.<br />“Today’s decision from a federal judge in New York is a victory for the courageous directly impacted plaintiffs, all DACA recipients and DACA-eligible youth,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, state and local policy manager for United We Dream and herself a DACA recipient.<br />The DACA program was created by the Obama administration in 2012 to offer work permits and deportation protections to young immigrants, known as Dreamers, who have been living in the country without legal permission since childhood. To apply, an immigrant must have arrived in the U.S. before age 16, lived in the country since 2007 and have a high-school diploma or a GED.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A California billionaire gave $333,800 to Republican Party accounts in 2016 and then enlisted the help of Abbe Lowell, a prominent Washington lawyer, to push White House officials to recommend a pardon for a friend, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />Sanford Diller, a philanthropist, was seeking the pardon of Hugh Baras, a California psychologist who was sentenced in 2014 to more than two years in prison for tax evasion and theft of government property, and said it was the one favor he sought in exchange for his donations, the documents reviewed by the Journal show.<br />The matter drew the attention of federal investigators. A court filing in federal district court in Washington unsealed earlier this week indicated that communications involving Mr. Lowell were at issue in an investigation of an alleged “secret lobbying scheme” and potential bribery in exchange for the pardon.<br />The court filing was heavily redacted but the roles of Mr. Lowell and Mr. Diller were confirmed this week by people familiar with the case and documents reviewed by the Journal. Their identities were earlier reported by the New York Times.<br />The Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section was investigating the case, according to people familiar with the investigation, and its status is unknown. The Justice Department declined to comment. “It is my understanding that the Justice Department had and has absolutely no quarrel with anything that Abbe did in this matter,” an attorney for Mr. Lowell, Reid Weingarten, said, adding: “There was no bribe, there was no clemency, this is what the prosecutors concluded and this entire matter is much ado about nothing.”</td>

(Unlike most recording artists of his stature, Mr. Bennett isn’t signed to a record label.) Five years ago, for example, the two longtime friends—Mr. Corcoran is about three years older—had only a 15-person team handling tasks like marketing and selling merchandise.<br />News of a rift between Chance the Rapper and his manager comes during the rockiest period of the artist’s career to date.</td>

      <td>Federal program allowing states to make Medicaid recipients work has been blocked by lower courts</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court said Friday it would consider the legality of a Trump administration program allowing states to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients.<br />Lower courts have blocked the program, which stripped health insurance from recipients who didn’t file paperwork demonstrating they were working or otherwise complying with or exempt from the requirements. Those courts found that the requirements interfered with Medicaid’s statutory purpose of  expanding health-care coverage for lower-income Americans.<br />In its Supreme Court appeal, the Trump administration argues that the secretary of Health and Human Services has broad discretion to authorize experimental projects to test policies that could further Medicaid’s purpose. The administration argues that promoting recipients’ economic self-sufficiency could improve “health outcomes”—for example, by “‘incentiviz[ing] beneficiaries to engage in their own health care”—and therefore is in line with the goals Congress established for Medicaid.<br />The case the high court agreed to hear centers on Arkansas, which in March 2018 was granted a waiver allowing it to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients through Dec. 31, 2021.<br />The waiver, which authorized a program called Arkansas Works, was in effect for 10 months before being blocked by a federal court.  “More than 18,000 people (about 25% of those subject to the work requirement) lost coverage as a result of the project in just five months,” a federal appeals court noted.</td>

      <td>The jobs report for November was disappointing, although nowhere nearly as much as the politicians claimed on Friday. Democrats and Republicans leapt on the news as justification for the $1 trillion spending bill they want to pass before the end of the year.<br />Joe Biden called the report “grim” and “shows an economy that’s stalling,” while White House economist Peter Navarro said the numbers mean “there’s a train wreck coming, folks” and it’s Congress’s “job to flip the switches so, so the trains don’t hit.” Bad economic news is good political news when you want to spend taxpayer money.<br />Yet the jobs report was hardly a disaster, as payrolls expanded in the month by a net 245,000 new jobs and the jobless rate fell to 6.7%. The private economy did even better with 344,000 new jobs, offset by a decline in government payrolls—mainly due to the end of 93,000 temporary census jobs. State and local governments lost a net of 13,000, nearly all of that related to local school closures.<br />Much of the economy is still recovering well from the pandemic recession, as manufacturing and construction both added 27,000 jobs in the month. Transportation and warehousing had a gangbusters month with 145,000 new hires, as  Amazon  continues to hire as many as 1,400 workers a day.  Walmart  has added tens of thousands of new U.S. workers since March, as its online sales have soared, and this week it announced more than $700 million in new cash bonuses for employees. The retailer has paid $2.8 billion in employee bonuses this year.<br />The struggling parts of the economy are smaller retailers, small businesses and consumer services hit by greater social distancing amid the sharp spike in Covid infections. Hiring for the holiday season was below normal. Restaurants and bars, which had been recovering, shed 17,400 jobs in the month.</td>

      <td>The legislation offered liability protections for good-faith actors.</td>
      <td>Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf says he feels the pain of businesses struggling to survive the pandemic, but does he really? On Monday he vetoed a bill providing liability protections for schools, businesses and other employers against Covid-related lawsuits.<br />Mr. Wolf in May issued an executive order protecting health-care workers and owners of real estate that was donated for Covid emergency services. His order doesn’t protect businesses from lawsuits by customers who catch Covid. The bill passed by the GOP Legislature did.<br />Nearly 80 associations representing schools, child-care providers, small businesses and others backed the bill. “For the foreseeable future,” they wrote in a letter to Mr. Wolf, “employers will be subject to strict workplace health and safety requirements and those who adopt these precautions should proceed with confidence knowing they will not be targeted with frivolous, and potentially devastating, litigation.”<br />The legislation wouldn’t absolve businesses that disregard public-health requirements. But its higher standards for lawsuits, requiring clear and convincing evidence of gross negligence, could head off many frivolous suits. More than a dozen states including Michigan and Idaho have enacted similar legislation. Mr. Wolf said the legislation was too broad and unnecessary, but businesses with their livelihoods on the line disagree.<br />His veto is especially worrisome given the state’s plaintiff-friendly legal climate. Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court and Philadelphia’s Court of Common Pleas top the American Tort Reform Association’s list of “Judicial Hellholes” this year. The report notes that Pennsylvania has one of the nation’s highest payout rates in medical liability suits, and Philadelphia is a top jurisdiction for asbestos litigation.</td>

      <td>Donald Trump’s campaign against the 2020 Presidential outcome undermines political legitimacy, but no side is blameless in America’s partisan election escalation. Witness the new Democratic effort to overturn the election result in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District—which could be emulated in New York’s 22nd if Republicans win there too.<br />Iowa’s state elections board on Monday certified Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks’s victory in the 2nd district, flipping a seat currently held by a Democrat. But her opponent, Rita Hart, is dusting off a 1969 federal statute to have the House of Representatives pick the winner. That means Democrats in Washington could overrule Iowa voters to seat a co-partisan and grow their majority.<br />The Iowa race was decided by six votes. The counting went on for weeks as 24 counties canvassed and recanvassed over 390,000 ballots, and lawyers from both sides haggled with election officials over machine counting, ballot qualifications and voter intent.<br />Normally this exhaustive process would end matters. Not this year. Ms. Hart’s campaign said it will bypass an Iowa court appeal and ask the Committee on House Administration to intervene. The House has final say on its Members’ elections and the Supreme Court has held that courts can’t intervene in those decisions under the Constitution’s Article I.<br />That means the count in Iowa’s 2nd District will become a political fight rather than a legal one. House Democrats in 1985 took advantage of the same process to reverse Indiana’s state certification of a Republican winner in a Congressional race. They refused to seat either candidate in January, and in May declared the Democrat the winner after their recount excluded 32 absentee votes.</td>

The U.S. troops are expected to leave the country by early next year, the officials said.<br />The move, supported by the new acting defense secretary, Chris Miller, effectively reverses the course set by his predecessor, Mark Esper. Mr. Esper favored drawing down U.S. forces operating in the volatile Sahel region of West Africa while maintaining the American presence in Somalia, according to a senior U.S. official.<br />The Pentagon, in a statement sent to lawmakers Friday, said that despite the withdrawal, U.S. aims in Somalia hadn’t changed. “We will continue to degrade violent extremist organizations that could threaten our homeland while ensuring we maintain our strategic advantage in great power competition,” the statement said.<br />The Trump administration’s push to reduce U.S. forces in Africa has drawn opposition from lawmakers from both parties who see a need for a continued American engagement in the continent’s conflict zones.

      <td>Two strikingly different ways of seeing the world, ordering society and understanding human destiny.</td>
      <td>Every man and every woman, it seems, knows Gilbert and Sullivan’s quipping lines from “Iolanthe” (1882): “That every boy and every gal / That’s born into the world alive. / Is either a little Liberal / Or else a little Conservative.” When the lines were first sung, the labels matched up with Britain’s political parties, but they obviously have a wider application—each calling to mind, then and now, a cultural outlook, an inclination, a temperament, even a philosophy. Over time, of course, even the firmest definition will shift, making easy summary difficult and historical circumstance—context, that is—crucial to our understanding of what “liberalism” is and how “conservatism” differs from it. These days, we may also ask: What sets the two sides of democratic politics so far apart?<br />Edmund Fawcett, a former editor and correspondent at the Economist, grappled with one end of this polarity in “Liberalism: The Life of an Idea,” published in 2014 and revised four years later. He now explores its opposing force in “Conservatism: The Fight for a Tradition.” A self-described left-wing liberal, Mr. Fawcett believes that both categories of thought (and politics) are facing critical tests, making it all the more urgent that we grasp their genealogy—how they developed and what they have come to represent. He calls his explorations “historical essays,” and indeed they are written in a reflective mode, though at times in an impassioned style. Members of both thought-categories will find much to learn from both books, not least from the historical figures Mr. Fawcett brings into view.<br />Mr. Fawcett notes that, in the broadest terms, the modern era in advanced societies has been governed by a liberal outlook, one in which the liberty or freedom of the individual has been increasingly protected from the state or “liberated” from custom, hierarchy and the institutions—notably, the church—that once dictated social relations and guided man’s understanding of himself. The origins of this outlook, he notes, can be traced to the Enlightenment, when “reason” was elevated to an exalted position and, it was believed, a rational scrutiny of both principles and institutions would lead humanity away from dark superstition and upward toward the light.<br />Enlightenment thinkers, Mr. Fawcett reminds us, encouraged the idea that society might be understood and thereby changed for the better. They also sought to sever moral codes from their traditional mooring, or at least to rethink them: As Mr. Fawcett puts it, David Hume and Immanuel Kant “welcomed liberty from ethical tutelage” so that men could determine their own standards of conduct. The German statesman Wilhelm von Humboldt saw education as a way to realize individual possibility rather than, as tradition would have it, train for an occupation or a social role. Benjamin Constant, in France, focused on the concept of liberty, which he defined as a condition of existence allowing people to turn away interference from either society or the state. Calling absolute power radically illegitimate, François Guizot insisted that human imperfection meant that no person, class, faith or interest should have the final say. Like other French liberals of his day, he sought a juste milieu—a place where interests and ideas could be balanced. Enlightenment philosophers on the Continent also challenged the assumptions of the ancien régime, helping open careers to talent and remove restrictions on office-holding long governed by religion and class.<br />These currents of thought we associate with the 18th century, and for good reason, but after the shock of the American and French revolutions, they were dammed up by the Napoleonic Wars and an interlude of restoration. It was only in the 1830s that the dam broke. A period of rapid change—brought on by the dislocations of the Industrial Revolution, the railway’s remarkable shrinking of distance, and episodes of agricultural depression and financial crisis—demanded a re-assessment of established patterns of thought and governance. Enlightenment-driven liberalism was one mode of response; conservatism, one might say, was a response to the response.</td>

      <td>Regarding Chester E. Finn Jr.’s “A Progressive Assault on Selective High Schools” (op-ed, Nov. 27): Ironically, eliminating the test-based admission process for entry to the country’s elite high schools would hurt the ethnic groups that its proponents are trying to help. Children from wealthy families will always have access to high-achieving schools, but for low-income families of all races the exam schools are their best chance for an equally high-level education. Eliminating the admission tests would destroy the elite schools and eliminate the only chance that poor, especially inner-city students have of receiving an education equal or better than that offered by the private city and wealthy suburban schools.<br />A well-designed exam measures not only what a student has learned but, more importantly, their capacity to learn new things. This is especially important for boys whose maturity level often lags behind their intellectual ability.

      <td>From his chaotic childhood to a lifetime as consort to the queen, Prince Philip has remained irrepressibly himself.</td>
      <td>As I was growing up, our monarchist British household considered Prince Philip a rather louche character. “It’s all very well for him,” my mother would comment tartly after the latest outrage—a caustic riposte, a scandalous gaffe or a “perfectly dreadful” brown hat worn on some royal tour. “He can say or do whatever he likes, but the queen can’t.”<br />Her comments were unfair. After all, Prince Philip had given up an illustrious career in his beloved Royal Navy to spend the next 70-some years of his life walking two steps behind the queen. A driven, restless and highly energetic man, he was not cut out for a secondary role. Yet as my father, born two months after Philip, was given to say: “You just get on with it.” And the prince consort did. In her biography “Prince Philip Revealed,” Ingrid Seward writes that above all he has been loyal. “For him duty is at the center of everything. It is not a choice.”<br />Royal biographies tend to fall into two categories: reverent, the subject’s imperfections whitewashed; or waspish, a chronicle of backstairs gossip. A clue into which category Ms. Seward’s book falls is provided on the back flap of the book jacket. The editor of a British magazine called Majesty (devoted entirely—surprise—to royals), she appears in a photograph alongside his royal highness, gazing up at him with a worshipful smile.<br />Do we really need yet another book on Prince Philip? What more is there to say about the man? Not a lot. But you can’t believe everything you see in Netflix’s “The Crown.” Ms. Seward’s biography is more than mere hagiography, although it is indeed reverential. And while she takes us painstakingly over well-trodden ground, she does produce some interesting information about Philip’s later years, in particular his relationships with Diana and Meghan Markle.<br />Prince Philip is the most intriguing member of the royal family. His childhood was bizarre. He was born on a dining table in a villa on Corfu, Greece, the youngest in a family of four sisters. His mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was stone deaf (she became a skilled lip reader in four languages). His half-Danish father, Prince Andrew, second in line to the Greek throne, was sentenced to death after the army was defeated in Smyrna by the Turks, saved only by the intervention of George V. In 1930, after eight years of impecunious exile in Paris, the family dispersed. Philip’s sisters married (two of them to high-ranking Nazis); his mother, now mentally ill, was committed to a sanatorium; his father moved to Monte Carlo with his mistress. Philip, at age 9, went away to boarding school. On holidays he was shunted around between relations—a person, he wrote in a guest book, “of no fixed abode.”</td>

But my guess is you’ll see a lot of virtual activity in states all across America,” Mr. Biden said Friday in Wilmington, Del. He said it was “highly unlikely” that millions of people would gather at the National Mall as part of the festivities.<br />“I think you’re going to see something that is closer to what the convention was like than a typical inauguration,” he said.<br />Mr. Biden said his transition team was holding discussions with congressional leaders in preparations for the events planned on Jan. 20, when he is scheduled to be sworn-in as the nation’s 46th president. Public health officials have continued to warn against large gatherings as coronavirus cases have skyrocketed across the country.<br />“First and foremost, my objective is to keep America safe but still allow people to celebrate,“ Mr. Biden said. ”People want to celebrate. People want to be able to say we’ve passed the baton. We’re moving on and democracy is functioning.”</td>

      <td>There is only one race: the human race.</td>
      <td>“The Predicament of Counting Americans by Race” (Review, Nov. 28) quotes Kenneth Prewitt, a former director of the U.S. Census Bureau, as saying, “race is incoherent.” He knows what population geneticists know. There is only one race: the human race. Every scientific attempt to classify humans racially has failed. Race is a social construct that changes on whims, biases and power plays. The amount of melanin pigment in the skin is of minuscule consequence genetically. France, where the government doesn’t officially track the race of its population, has it right. Where France continues to go wrong, apparently, is in its slipshod enforcement of justice and fairness for all people.<br />Jeff Kalenak<br />Brookfield, Wis.<br /><br />For the last five census enumerations, I have listed my race as American. I was born here, as were my parents. My mother’s side of the family has been in the Hudson Valley since before the English fought the French and Indian War. Her ancestors are a mix of several nationalities and the Mohegan Tribe. Most of my father’s family emigrated here in the 1900s.

      <td>The shifts and ambiguities in the novelist’s work resonate with a historian who has chronicled the shadowy forces of persecution.</td>
      <td>At the outset of this brief but haunting work, Saul Friedländer asks himself a question. Now 88, the eminent historian of the Holocaust wonders whether he felt the urge to reread Marcel Proust’s great multivolume novel “In Search of Lost Time” in response “to some need, to something in my personal life that called for delving into that book.” At the close, he will give us an answer. In the meantime, this lifelong student of the worst in human history and character finds relief from a dark vocation in the beauty and irony—and deep ambiguity—of an author he deems “the greatest painter in words in French literature.” This, though, is a shadowed portrait—and the shadows occasionally fall not only over Proust, but his champion as well.<br />Mr. Friedländer has always imbued his scholarship with an acute literary sensibility rooted in a multilingual, border-crossing background. Born in Prague to a nonreligious Jewish family, young Pavel moved to France when the Nazis invaded his Czech homeland. Separated from his parents (who would die in Auschwitz), he survived the war in occupied France as a pupil at a Catholic school but returned to his ancestral faith. Now an ardent Zionist, he left for Israel in 1948. There Pavel/Paul became Saul (reversing the path of his New Testament namesake). He worked for the future Israeli premier and president Shimon Peres, but turned sharply against the divisive nationalism of the Netanyahu era. As a historian, based in Geneva and then at UCLA, he integrated daily life and high policy into his panoramic study of the Third Reich as it descended from persecution to extermination.<br />In addition to the prize-winning volumes of his “Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1933-1945” he has written two luminous memoirs: “When Memory Comes” and “Where Memory Leads.” After a 2013 book on Franz Kafka’s shame and guilt, Mr. Friedländer confirms his late swerve toward literature in the incisive and quizzical essays of “Proustian Uncertainties.” Proust, the conflicted son of a doting Jewish mother and a distant Catholic father, speaks to the historian who mapped the shifting sands of identity in a period when tolerance and assimilation vied with bigotry and harassment.<br />He finds Proust “undecided to the end” about his Jewishness. The nameless narrator of “In Search of Lost Time”—who sometimes shares his creator’s views but often doesn’t—directs both warm sympathy and snobbish mockery toward Jewish characters. He even compares one inoffensive friend to a “hyena,” a spasm of disgust that reveals, for Mr. Friedländer, the “secret self-image” of Proust as a guilty parvenu. Behind this “constant seesaw” lie the bleeding wounds of the Dreyfus Affair, which tore France apart—and divides the novel’s characters—after the Jewish officer was wrongly convicted of treason in 1895.<br />Proust’s homosexuality, which called for perpetual wariness and discretion, also shifted and sharpened his angles of vision. His fiction, Mr. Friedländer shows, mounts an “eloquent defense of homosexuality,” courageous for its date. Still, it can descend into “the language of hatred,” even for the buffoonish but heroic Baron de Charlus—that unforgettable gay Falstaff. Proust shows us a lesbian couple engaged in a symbolic “act of desecration” of a father’s memory, an outrage justified by the narrator as an “escape” from unbearably mixed feelings. Proust’s uncertainties bred Proustian contradictions aplenty.</td>

It couldn’t be learned how many people would be withdrawn from the embassy. While the State Department doesn’t disclose the number of people at the complex, the total has been estimated in the thousands.<br />The State Department said it continually adjusts staffing at facilities around the world but doesn’t comment on specifics of the adjustments. An official said U.S. Ambassador Matthew Tueller remains in Iraq and the embassy has continued to operate.<br />In a video the U.S. embassy released on its social-media accounts, Mr. Tueller said, “The temporary reduction of staff numbers will not affect the commitment of these dedicated personnel.”</td>

For decades Turkey worked to build a society open to people of all faiths, and stood against Russian aggression. But a valuable ally has drifted.<br />The U.S. agreed to sell Turkey 100 F-35 jet fighters and include Turkish companies in manufacturing components of the aircraft. But three years ago, Ankara decided to purchase the Russian S-400 missile-defense system, designed to shoot down the F-35. Allowing Russian “advisers” to work near F-35s and giving the S-400 radar proximity to American stealth aircraft is unacceptable.<br />Diplomats, the Pentagon and senators, including us, warned Turkish government officials that there would be consequences. The president should now follow the law and levy sanctions against Turkish entities. The Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act requires sanctions against any country that engages in a “significant transaction” of defense assets with Russia, Iran or North Korea.<br />President Trump has demonstrated his commitment to putting American interests first. And the president has given Turkey every opportunity to cooperate with NATO. Congress, with broad bipartisan support, included enforcement language on Turkey in last year’s national defense authorization.<br />Punishing Turkey for choosing Russia over the U.S. would be a clear warning. Other nations should consider who is a better trade partner: the U.S., with more than 20% of the world’s economy, or Russia, with an economy smaller than the economies of some U.S. states. A failure to follow through would send the message that the U.S. isn’t willing to make hard decisions.</td>

      <td>The stereotypical Canadian can’t stop saying he’s sorry. People from Halifax, Nova Scotia, can’t stop saying thank you. Every year Nova Scotia donates one of its finest firs or spruces to serve as Boston’s official Christmas tree. The gifts come in gratitude for Boston’s help after the 1917 Halifax Explosion—the largest man-made blast of the preatomic age.<br />On the morning of Dec. 6, 1917, the SS Mont-Blanc entered Halifax’s harbor carrying thousands of tons of explosives en route from New York to France for use in World War I. The Norwegian steamship SS Imo, traveling above the speed limit and in the wrong lane, was exiting the harbor. They collided.<br />Unaware of the Mont-Blanc’s cargo, crowds gathered to see the fire. A sailor appraised train dispatcher Vince Coleman of the danger, and rather than flee, Coleman warned incoming trains: “Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbour making for Pier 6 and will explode. Guess this will be my last message. Good-bye boys.” Coleman died at his post; his warning saved as many as 300 lives.<br />The explosion sent up a mushroom cloud 2 miles high and shattered windows 50 miles away. It vaporized water, exposing the harbor floor. Samuel Prince, a survivor, described the devastation in a 1920 dissertation: “Trees were torn from the ground. Poles were snapped like toothpicks. Trains were stopped dead. Cars were left in twisted masses. Pedestrians were thrown violently into the air, houses collapsed on all sides. Streamers were slammed against the docks. Then followed a veritable air-raid, when the sky rained iron fragments upon the helpless city.”<br />Some 2,000 were killed and 9,000 wounded in a city of 50,000. Twelve thousand buildings were obliterated or badly damaged. Suddenly, half the city was homeless in the cold.</td>

      <td>Use of face coverings increased impressively right into the current national outbreak.</td>
      <td>It’s to be expected that many who spent four years unproductively obsessing about President Trump now believe his ambivalent mask messaging is responsible for every infection and death in the U.S. The mask issue is not nearly so simple.<br />Mask compliance has actually been pretty good around the U.S. and in Europe regardless of Donald Trump and it didn’t stop the current, worst-yet surge. In frustration, the CDC’s Robert Redfield insisted in midsummer that if everybody wore a mask for several weeks, the virus could be controlled. What he really might have liked to say: “It doesn’t matter how many of us wear masks if the young, who have the least to fear from Covid and are most likely to spread it unwittingly, aren’t wearing them.”<br />Until Nov. 10, his agency truthfully stressed that masks won’t save you from getting the disease, only from transmitting it. Now this guidance has been changed in apparent hope that the noncompliant might respond to a new message that doesn’t lean so heavily on their altruism. And yet a national survey from researchers at Harvard, Rutgers, Northeastern and Northwestern throws cold water on any idea of masks as a simple fix. Mask usage increased impressively across the U.S. right into the current outbreaks even as physical distancing fell by the wayside. “We find that social distancing has decreased dramatically since the spring, while mask wearing has increased,” the group concludes. At worst, our face-covering psychodrama distracted from the behavior that really matters.<br />Whether a Thanksgiving bump will materialize will be known in the next few days. Millions who defied guidance and traveled may have done so safely. France, Spain, Italy and Belgium have seen new infections turn down sharply in the past two weeks. The exception is Germany. Its leaders cite a “prevention paradox”—so successfully was an earlier surge moderated that people stopped fearing the virus. The U.S. may have created a similar problem for itself in spades with the national lockdown in the spring that landed like a lead balloon in parts of the country where the epidemic had not yet reached. We may still be paying for this “cry wolf” episode.<br />For what it’s worth, I see universal mask compliance and yet my state is enduring a surge right along with the others. I see virtue signaling on TV by anchors in a position to infect nobody but a camera. I see slippage below the nose which defeats the purpose of masking up. I see obstreperous old guys who recognize that a mask is a useful tool but get their backs up over people politicizing and fetishizing it.</td>

Chevron Corp. on Thursday said it will cut its annual capital spending budget by 26% next year and sharply through the middle of next decade, as the coronavirus pandemic forces an industry-wide reappraisal of fossil fuel investment. That followed  Exxon Mobil Corp.’s  retreat from a plan to increase spending to boost its oil-and-gas production as the struggling company reassesses its next decade. Chevron shares fell 0.1 % Thursday.<br />General Motors Co. is tapping the brakes on its relationship with electric-truck startup  Nikola Corp.  The Detroit auto giant revealed Monday it is scaling back a pact that had fueled investor enthusiasm for both companies. Under the revised deal, GM still intends to provide Nikola with fuel-cell technology but is scrapping plans to build an electric pickup truck called the Badger for Nikola and will no longer take a stake in the company. The move comes after a short seller’s report raised questions about the readiness of some aspects of Nikola’s business, allegations the company said were false and misleading. GM shares fell 2.7% Monday.<br /><br />A new face-off is unfolding in the world of beauty. Sephora plans to install 850 shops inside Kohl’s Corp. stores by 2023, upending the beauty retailer’s longstanding partnership with  J.C. Penney Co.  That follows  Ulta Beauty Inc.’s  deal announced in November to open more than 100 shops inside  Target Corp.  stores by next year. Beauty has been one of retail’s brighter spots during the pandemic. Department stores are struggling to find new revenue sources as shoppers turn to fast-fashion chains, discount retailers and e-commerce players. Shares of Kohl’s rose 13% Tuesday.<br /></td>

Employers added 245,000 jobs last month, less than half the 610,00 jobs added in October, and the unemployment rate dropped slightly to 6.7%. Many Americans are seeing temporary furloughs become permanent.<br />“We had some not-so-good news on the job front that further necessitates our taking action,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said at a news conference Friday.</td>

      <td>President Trump’s re-election campaign had warned of debt after Election Day. But a postelection fundraising blitz tied to his unsuccessful effort to reverse his election loss has raised $207.5 million for Mr. Trump’s political committees and the Republican Party.<br />The president’s team pulled back on spending in some battleground states as Election Day approached, interviews with Trump advisers and advertising records show. His campaign had $18.4 million in cash on hand and about $11.3 million in payments owed to vendors as of Nov. 23, according to Federal Election Commission reports filed late Thursday.<br />His campaign’s cash position was boosted by an unprecedented postelection email-and-text-messaging fundraising drive to service campaign debt, fund other political committees and finance his court battle, which hasn’t shown election-changing evidence of voter fraud.<br />The Trump campaign had spent more than $8.8 million on its recount effort as of late November, according to the new FEC reports, which cover the period from Oct. 15 to Nov. 23. Expenses include a $3 million filing fee for a Wisconsin recount and $2.6 million in legal consulting, including a $30,000 payment to legal team member Jenna Ellis.<br />There is no documented payment to Rudy Giuliani, who is spearheading the legal team, nor to Sidney Powell, whom Mr. Trump and others first described as a team member and later said was no longer part of it.</td>

While rising virus infections could lead to weaker-than-expected economic activity in the coming weeks, the vaccine progress has reduced the chances of much weaker growth in 2021.<br />“The risk characterization has improved,” Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Friday.</td>

      <td>Overseas companies registered in U.S. would have to declare their true ownership</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Congress is set to approve legislation requiring companies in the U.S. to register their true owners, plugging what many illicit-finance experts say is one of the biggest holes in U.S. anti-money-laundering rules.<br />Lawmakers in both parties late Thursday announced an agreement to overhaul the framework for fighting money laundering. The measures are expected to be voted on as soon as next week as part of an annual defense-policy bill.<br />Proponents have been trying to pass so-called beneficial-ownership legislation for nearly two decades but have been blocked by groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world’s largest business group, and the American Bar Association, according to advocates. But the Chamber has dropped its opposition and now supports the measure as lawmakers addressed the group’s privacy concerns.<br />Among the biggest changes: handing federal officials the true identities of company owners that had previously been allowed to operate anonymously, through the creation of a new registry at the Treasury Department. While information on beneficial owners of companies registering in the U.S. won’t be available to the public, law enforcement would have access to the data under the legislation.<br />Under existing law, companies aren’t under any federal obligation to report the true owners who benefit from its operations. Agents can register on behalf of owners in many U.S. states, or other companies owned by the true owners can be cited as the owners, allowing the true owners to create a string of shell companies that obscure their identities.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—U.S. exports and imports both rose for a fifth straight month in October, reflecting a continued recovery in global commerce driven by a strong economic rebound in China.<br />Exports from the U.S. rose 2.2% to $182.0 billion from the previous month, while imports rose 2.1% to $245.1 billion, the Commerce Department said Friday. The trade deficit widened to $63.1 billion from $62.1 billion. The figures were adjusted for seasonal variations.<br />Global trade has recovered more quickly than economists expected since widespread lockdowns were imposed in March and April, but activity remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Economists say the outlook for trade remains uncertain amid a resurgence of the virus and renewed lockdowns in the U.S. and Europe.<br />“Virus transmissions remain elevated, and widening restrictions on activity, at home and abroad, have the potential to disrupt supply chains and weigh on demand,” Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics said in a research note.<br />Compared with a year earlier, U.S. exports in October were down 13.5%, while imports fell 3.3%. The deficit increased 47% year-over-year.</td>

      <td>Chicago Fed leader says government aid is quickest way to deliver new support to the economy</td>
      <td>Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said Friday that although the latest job creation data is disappointing, he wasn’t yet ready to call for changes in central-bank monetary policy.<br />Instead, he said government aid, which can be targeted and deployed quickly, is the most effective way to deliver new support to the U.S. economy right now, and is more potent relative to what the Fed can do with its suite of tools.<br />The November data, which showed moderating levels of job creation, was “weaker than I was expecting,” Mr. Evans told reporters after remarks to a Michigan banking group. But even so, he said he doesn’t see a need for the Fed to alter its path in what remains a time of high uncertainty.<br />“The most important source of stimulus for the economy over the next few months is some type of fiscal support and increase in public health safety support,” Mr. Evans said. “I think that that would be quicker. I think that that’s most relevant at the moment” compared with actions the Federal Reserve could take.<br />In a separate appearance, Minneapolis Fed leader Neel Kashakari joined with Mr. Evans in expressing concern about the slow pace of job creation. The government said the jobless rate stood at 6.7% last month—it’s down from a shockingly high 14.7% in April—but many economists noted the drop in unemployment was actually driven by people leaving the labor force.</td>

      <td>Governments scramble to secure limited vaccine supplies, and only a small sliver of the population will receive a shot for months to come</td>
      <td>The race to vaccinate the world’s population against Covid-19 is shifting into a high stakes contest, as governments scramble to secure the small number of doses becoming available from Western pharmaceutical companies and Russia and China race to fill the gap.<br />The result is a fragmentary global vaccination drive likely to proceed at vastly different speeds. For most people around the world, a vaccine will remain a distant hope for several months, and it could be years before the poorest countries cover their people. Consequently, governments may need to deploy alternatives like widespread testing and smarter social distancing restrictions in order to contain the virus’s spread, global public health experts said.<br />“When we talk about the global vaccine race, there are still a lot more questions than answers,” said Syra Madad, a senior director at New York City’s Health and Hospitals Corporation. “I don’t think it’s going to be enough to get us out of the pandemic.… If the question is, is a vaccine an exit strategy? It’s part of an exit strategy.”<br />Europe and America have struck dozens of different, competing bilateral contracts with drug makers, but initial supplies will be limited, forcing hard choices through at least the first quarter of next year.<br />This week, the U.K.’s authorization of the West’s first vaccine offered hope that other leading Western candidates could soon cross the finish line. But the front-running candidates use novel viral RNA technology that is hard to scale up. Whether and how soon the U.S. and EU can inoculate the majority of their populations will partly depend on whether other vaccines—which use more traditional platforms—prove safe and effective.</td>

      <td>If there were ever a year to ship our loved ones cookie tins brimming with cheer, this is it. With these top techniques from pro bakers, festive treats arrive fresh, intact and full of sparkle.</td>
      <td>THIS SEASON, many of us are scaling back our holiday celebrations. But even if you can’t gather with everyone you love, you can still feed them. Spread holiday cheer—remotely—by baking and mailing packages of comforting cookies.<br />Sharing cookies is a longstanding holiday ritual. This time of year, kitchens turn into production facilities to supply cookie swaps, tree-trimming parties and holiday open houses. Even in normal times, some of those cookies would travel by mail. But in 2020, shipping cookies takes on new resonance. “I don’t know of a better gift than to bake for someone,” said Kelly Fields, author of “The Good Book of Southern Baking” (Lorena Jones Books) and owner of Willa Jean restaurant in New Orleans. “Baking is my love language.”<br />First, you need to choose your cookies. Ms. Fields ships baked goods from Willa Jean nationwide via the mail-order-food site Goldbelly. She recommends sticking with sturdy varieties for shipping—drop cookies, shortbreads, biscotti. Stay away from iced or filled cookies, or any that are brittle or tender. “I love pecan sandies enough that if somebody was to ship them to me, I would enjoy the crumbs as much as the cookie,” said Ms. Fields. “But not everybody is of that opinion.”<br />Picking durable cookies is a good excuse to forgo fussiness altogether. Put away the frosting tubes, rolling pins and cookie cutters, and let lower-maintenance flourishes—powdered sugar, sprinkles, sanding sugar—do the dazzling. “If I did the thing where I made cutout cookies with the sugars and royal icing decorations and piping bags, then you have to wait for them to dry,” said Claire Saffitz, author of “Dessert Person” (Clarkson Potter). “I don’t have time to do that anymore. I like cookies that don’t require decoration and look pretty on their own.” Her slice-and-bake pistachio pinwheels, with their hypnotic, swirly green pattern, are both stunning and surprisingly simple to make.<br />While some bakers feel compelled to churn out a smorgasbord, it’s OK to stick with one variety. “There are people who would be super pumped to get a dozen chocolate chip cookies, and equally excited to get a dozen of three or four different kinds,” said Ms. Fields. “Whatever you’re going to have the most fun with is the right number.”</td>

The legislation would also expunge some criminal records and impose a 5% federal tax on cannabis products to help fund programs in communities hurt by the war on drugs.<br />The vote was largely along party lines. Libertarian Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan and five Republicans voted in favor of the bill, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) who was a cosponsor. Six Democrats voted against the bill, all centrist lawmakers.<br />The bill was a Democratic priority in the House, where lawmakers see it as a civil rights issue.

      <td>Trump lost badly in New York and California, but Republican candidates picked up House seats in both states. Here’s how two of them did it.</td>
      <td>A quarter-century apart in age, Nicole Malliotakis and Michelle Steel are classmates. They’re both freshmen, Republicans who’ve won election to the House of Representatives for the first time. Each ousted an incumbent Democrat in a resolutely blue state—New York and California, respectively—where Joe Biden romped home in November. And each woman has a scathing view of the politics of the other’s state as well as of her own. They’re ready to scorn Govs. Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom. As for Mayor Bill de Blasio, Ms. Malliotakis, a state assemblywoman from New York City, practically combusts at the mention of his name.<br />“I think our leaderships are competing with each other to be the most radical. They keep getting bad ideas from each other,” says Ms. Malliotakis, 40, who will represent New York’s 11th Congressional District, comprised of the borough of Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn.<br />“The leadership is trying to make these states into Third World countries,” Ms. Steel, 65, responds. She is a member of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, a local legislative body, and representative-elect from California’s 48th District, a beachy slice of the county. In Washington for a freshman orientation, including a lottery for office space, the two talk to me by Zoom from their hotel rooms near the Capitol.<br />Both are robust proponents of low taxes and limited government. “Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Ms. Malliotakis says: “The government should provide an environment for that—and then get out of the way.” Ms. Steel—who was born in South Korea and came to the U.S. at 19—confesses to drawing her earliest political beliefs from her mother’s experience as a clothing-store owner in Los Angeles. “I saw that my mom was harassed—really harassed—by a tax agency, the State Board of Equalization,” she says. “And you know what? I decided that the Republican Party’s ideology is much better for small-business owners. They need less regulation and smaller taxes.” Her first foray into elective politics was a successful run for the Board of Equalization in 2007.<br />Not long into our conversation, however, a difference emerges. Asked what role President Trump played in her race, Ms. Steel says that he was “not really a factor.” Hers was a very local race: “For an 18-month period, it was just Rouda vs. Steel.” (Rep. Harley Rouda won election in 2018, unseating 15-term Republican Dana Rohrabacher.) The voters in her district, she says, “were more concerned about their businesses”—hit hard by the pandemic—and with state and local taxes.</td>

      <td>Maria Garcia applied for aid and was denied simply because she doesn’t ‘identify as Black.’</td>
      <td>Portland, Ore.<br />The state of Oregon, hoping to strike a blow against both the pandemic and “systemic racism,” has established a Covid relief fund exclusively for blacks and black-owned businesses. The Oregon Cares Fund website accurately describes the program as “unprecedented.” It is also surely unconstitutional.<br />In July the Oregon Legislature Emergency Board allotted $200 million to assist small businesses suffering losses because of the pandemic and government-ordered shutdowns. Of the total, $62 million was set aside for the Oregon Cares Fund, whose website describes it as “a Fund for Black people, Black-owned businesses, and Black community based organizations.” Black families are eligible for up to $3,000 and black-owned businesses for up to $100,000.<br />Maria Garcia, owner of the Revolucion Coffee House in Portland, applied for support. She was denied because her business “does not meet the criteria because 0% of its owners identify as Black.” She has sued in federal court, alleging that the denial violates her rights under the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. Last month a federal court declined a petition in another lawsuit, by the timber company Great Northern Resources, to enjoin further distributions from the Cares Fund. Both cases await a ruling on the constitutional merits.<br />The state couldn’t have been surprised at the challenges. Oregon’s Legislative Counsel advised the Emergency Board that, absent evidentiary findings of past discrimination by the state in the relevant industries, “the program would almost certainly be unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.” But in a brief submitted to the Legislature, the Portland law firm Schwabe, Williamson & Wyatt gave the board cover with this now familiar refrain: “Centuries of systemic and institutional discrimination—perpetuated and exacerbated by current systems—have caused economic disparities.”</td>

      <td>‘12 Sunsets,’ his new interactive digital archive, includes 65,000 images covering all 22 miles of Sunset Boulevard</td>
      <td>When Ed Ruscha began photographing the streets of Los Angeles decades ago, strangers would ask what he was doing, squinting behind the lens of a retrofitted Nikon on a tripod in the flatbed of his Datsun pickup truck. “I just said, ‘Ahhh, this is a school project.’ Or something like that,” Mr. Ruscha recalls.<br />For more than 50 years, the artist has meticulously documented a number of streets, including Sunset Boulevard, which runs 22 miles from downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific Ocean. Now some 65,000 of his photographs of the street have been digitized and collected in “12 Sunsets,” an online archive launched recently by the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles. Capturing Sunset Boulevard year in and year out “became an obsession,” Mr. Ruscha said, “because it’s such a Rolling Thunder of a street!”<br />Mr. Ruscha, who turns 83 this month, mixes Pop art, conceptual art and surrealism in a varied oeuvre infused with deadpan wit. “I kind of bounce around between making paintings and things that are not paintings, or drawings,” he said. “And I make prints, lithographs, etchings—things like that.”<br />The seeds of “12 Sunsets” were planted in 2012, when the Getty acquired an archive of about 500,000 images of Los Angeles streets by Mr. Ruscha. Over the years, he stored many strips of negatives by winding them around motion-picture reels. “We got these giant film canisters, as if we’d gotten 10 copies of ‘Lawrence of Arabia,’” said Andrew Perchuk, deputy director of the Getty Research Institute.<br />The images are a trove for demographers, urban planners and architectural historians: “There is no other such fine-grained record of an American city that anybody knows of,” Mr. Perchuk said. Visitors to the site can tool virtually along Sunset in either direction, east or west, and see how restaurants, karate schools and tuxedo-rental centers flourished and vanished. A stretch of the boulevard in West Hollywood known as the Sunset Strip was a longtime center of the music business, whose presence comes through in stores such as Organ Center and Guitars ‘R’ Us, the offices of music publishers and a sprawling Tower Records.</td>

      <td>LONDON—Ivan Glasenberg, the longtime chief executive of  Glencore  PLC, is handing over the reins of the global mining and trading giant he built, saying Friday he would retire in the first half of next year.<br />The Switzerland-based, London-listed company said it had tapped Gary Nagle, a senior deputy who currently runs the company’s coal industrial assets, for the top job.<br />A successor to one-time-fugitive Marc Rich at the company that would become Glencore, Mr. Glasenberg transformed it from a privately held trading house into the largest coal marketer in the world. An unapologetic promoter of coal, he continued to ramp up that business despite a growing backlash from governments, regulators and eventually investors, who criticized the fossil fuel for contributing to climate change.<br />In the past few years, however, Mr. Glasenberg began to shift away from a focus on coal, emphasizing Glencore’s big position in commodities key to building electric cars and renewable energy infrastructure, like nickel, copper and cobalt. The announcement of Mr. Glasenberg’s retirement came on a day when the company also said it planned to reduce its emissions to net zero by 2050. That will partly be possible, the company said, because of its depleting reserves of coal.<br />Mr. Glasenberg said he is handing off a company better positioned than others to take advantage of this energy shift. “No one has a portfolio of this mix to meet the energy demands of the future,” he told reporters Friday.</td>

      <td>Your shopping habits during the pandemic are reshaping America’s labor market.<br />The nation added jobs for the seventh straight month in November, the Labor Department said Friday. Most came in the transportation and warehousing industries—the ones that package, ship and deliver goods to consumers. Households’ shift toward buying sneakers, groceries and even cars online is driving a hiring binge in logistics industries.<br />Warehousing and transportation accounted for 145,000 of the 245,000 jobs created in November—and a big share of job growth since the labor market began recovering this spring after a sharp contraction due to the coronavirus pandemic. Online retailer  Amazon.com Inc.  has announced plans to hire hundreds of thousands of workers this year, including warehouse and seasonal employees.<br />The shift is creating a divide in the workplace. U.S. employment is still 6.5% smaller than it was in February, the month before the pandemic caused businesses across the U.S. to close. But employment in warehousing and related industries has boomed. Warehousing and storage jobs have grown by 97,000, or 8%, since February. Courier and messenger jobs—workers who deliver goods—have expanded by 182,000, or 22%.<br />Much of the growth is tied to consumer spending. Even before the pandemic, U.S. households were increasingly buying retail items online, including clothing, gifts and groceries. The pandemic has accelerated that trend.

      <td>The 28 reliefs in Andrea Pisano’s doors for the Florence Baptistery depict the Virtues and scenes from the life of John the Baptist.</td>
      <td>Standing for centuries in the Piazza della Signoria in the sun, rain and snow was giving Michelangelo’s David a skin condition, so in 1873 Florentines transplanted the marble statue to the protective rotunda of the nearby Galleria dell’Accademia, to be bathed in the illumination of a domed skylight. Other outdoor Florentine art treasures have since followed suit, most recently the pair of gilded bronze doors commissioned by one of the city’s merchant guilds and designed by Andrea Pisano in 1330 for the Baptistery of Florence’s cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore. A year ago this month, after three years of painstaking restoration, a blink in Florentine time, the doors—the oldest of three pairs done for the Baptistery—were installed in a purpose-built hall inside the church’s art and sculpture museum, the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo. Replicas replaced the originals.<br />Andrea’s doors joined the famous Gates of Paradise and another set, both by Lorenzo Ghiberti (1378-1455). All had weathered centuries of pollution, not to mention the devastating flood of 1966. They now stand together under protective glass in the museum’s luminous main hall, the gold leaf once obscured by grime now flickering in the light.<br />Of all the great artworks Italy has produced, the Baptistery’s doors, their sculpted reliefs illustrating biblical narratives, are among the most sacred, and not just because they belong to a major Italian cathedral. The triumvirate, created between 1329 and 1452, spans a critical period that saw the so-called proto-Renaissance of the late Middle Ages flower into the High Renaissance. Andrea sculpted his doors during Giotto’s lifetime; Ghiberti completed the Gates of Paradise the year Leonardo da Vinci was born. The trio forms a historical cycle.<br />Andrea modeled his doors on the monumental San Ranieri bronze gates finished in 1186 by Bonanno Pisano (no relation) for the Cathedral of Pisa, which featured 10 rectangular reliefs depicting scenes from the life of Christ within a decorative architectural grid that unified the whole. Andrea’s set has 28 narrative reliefs within an architectural grid, eight depicting the Virtues (placed in two rows at the bottom); the remaining 20 scenes are from the life of St. John the Baptist, patron saint of Florence, to whom the Baptistery was dedicated.<br />Unlike in Pisa, where bronze plates were attached to wooden frames, the Baptistery doors were entirely cast in bronze, and within each rectangle the scene is set within a medieval quatrefoil. In all but five, the action takes place on a projecting shelf or platform.</td>

      <td>Situation has already gotten worse since the November jobs report was compiled</td>
      <td>The job market is in danger of stalling. With the Covid epidemic worsening across the country, that should hardly count as a surprise, but perhaps it will stir both Congress and the Federal Reserve to move faster than they otherwise might have.<br />The Labor Department on Friday reported that the economy added 245,000 jobs in November, short of the 440,000 economists expected and far weaker than October’s gain of 610,000. That left the U.S. with 9.8 million fewer jobs than in February, before the crisis took hold. The unemployment rate slipped to 6.7% from 6.9%, but that was because fewer people were looking for work—a reflection of people throwing in the towel on finding a job, or taking themselves out of the labor force to care for homebound children.<br />If anything, the current state of affairs is worse than what was depicted in the job report. The surveys that the jobs and unemployment figures are based upon measured the state of things in the pay periods included in the week ended Nov. 14.  Since then, Covid cases, hospitalizations and deaths have risen, spurring renewed caution on the part of many Americans, while colder weather is hurting businesses that have been relying on outdoor arrangements, such as restaurants. This chill is showing up in higher-frequency data: Restaurant reservation figures from OpenTable show a marked decline since early November, for example, while figures from scheduling-software company Homebase show that the number of hourly employees working at restaurants, retailers and other small businesses is slipping.<br />For investors the silver lining is that the job figures could help push another round of government support over the finish line. With a bipartisan group from the House and Senate reaching a broad consensus around a new $908 billion aid package, the possibility of Congress passing a deal before it breaks for the holidays is looking more likely.<br />Fed officials, too, might be more inclined to step up their efforts to support the economy when they meet later this month. That could include committing to continue the central bank’s purchases of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities until certain economic conditions are met. It might also tilt Treasury purchases more to longer-dated securities in an effort to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates.</td>

      <td>Out on the water or down in the pub, Cornish fishermen hold on to an ancient way of life.</td>
      <td>In the spring of 2017, Lamorna Ash, then a 22-year-old graduate student in anthropology at University College London, rode British Rail from Paddington Station all the way down the “Cornish Riviera” to Penzance, the last stop on the Great Western line. Her plan was to immerse herself in the life of Newlyn, a small fishing village just beyond Penzance on the coastal road toward Land’s End, in order to do field research for her master’s thesis on the culture of a tight-knit community whose work has centered around a single industry—fishing—for centuries. Ms. Ash, named for a nearby coastal landmark—Lamorna Cove—was drawn to Cornwall by her family’s history there, including her mother’s childhood home and subsequent family holidays.<br />Ms. Ash successfully completed her master’s degree—and then some. “Dark, Salt, Clear” is an extraordinary debut, a deeply researched and deeply felt work of narrative nonfiction. It is the kind of book that ziplines readers to a different world. You’ll feel the damp sea air and smell the fish and ale in this vivid, multifaceted portrait of a hardworking, hard-drinking town and its salty residents, intimately connected to one another and to every aspect of its sea-to-market fishing industry. Ms. Ash explores questions about work, life and community and in so doing reflects on her own choices. On top of everything else, this book charts the author’s own passage to maturity as she re-evaluates what matters to her.<br />Although set along a stretch of the same spectacular, craggy coastline as “The Salt Path” (2018), Raynor Winn’s memoir about hiking the entire 630-mile Southwest Coast Path with her ailing husband following bankruptcy and a dire medical diagnosis, “Dark, Salt, Clear” is a deep dive into a distinctive culture rather than a tale of confronting adversity with a literal walk on the wild side. Over the course of two separate stays, first in spring and later in fall, Ms. Ash lodges with a local couple—Denise, a fishmonger, and Lofty, a ship’s chandler—in their cottage overlooking the harbor in Newlyn’s fisherman’s quarter, known as the Fradgan. “I don’t think I really knew what community meant before staying with Denise and Lofty,” she writes. “Because those who live in the village also work in the village and socialize here too, there is a depth to their relationships virtually unheard of in sprawling cities.”<br />Her well-connected hosts introduce her to fellow old-timers, including a police sergeant/birdwatcher with a blog called “Ornitholosism II—It’s a Religion!” who teaches her about the local avian culture. A retired geologist gives her a crash tutorial on the long history of the region’s geography and geology, evidenced in the largely untampered coastline, whose “bald cliffs act like time exposed, their many layers—some with lines of dark orange copper running through them—recounting the story of the county’s ancient past.”<br />Ms. Ash explores Newlyn’s drinking culture firsthand, with rowdy nights at the Swordy and the Star, two pubs frequented by local fishermen. There is much talk about the challenges of fishing quotas, climate change, repeated absences from family and the economic stresses of gentrification as the area becomes ever more popular with tourists and second-home buyers. Although Newlyn is one of the largest and most profitable fishing ports in the U.K., salaries are low, with the average wage 17% below the rest of the country’s. In fact, Ms. Ash reports that Cornwall suffers from high rates of homelessness and had the third highest suicide rate in the U.K. in 2017. Yet despite living in the only U.K. county poor enough to qualify for emergency funding from the European Union, local fishermen, frustrated with the encroachment of EU vessels on local fishing grounds, largely voted for Brexit.</td>

      <td>From ‘Rent’ to ‘The Producers,’ the 1990s proved a decade of stage hits from unexpected sources.</td>
      <td>It’s a bittersweet experience to pick up Michael Riedel’s fun and gossipy new showbiz history, “Singular Sensation: The Triumph of Broadway.” Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the “Triumph” of its title would have been arguable: While Broadway was thriving this time last year, the business suffered from systemic problems that had never really been addressed, such as bloated ticket prices and venal scalpers. In the wake of Covid-19, Broadway’s future is highly uncertain. When will theaters reopen? Will tourists and New York theatergoers actually want to cram themselves into those crowded houses? Will 2019 ticket prices hold in the post-Covid economy? If not, will theater owners, producers and unions agree to temper their greed?<br />It seems to me, then, that “Singular Sensation,” which examines Broadway through the 1990s, gives a brief summary of the 2000s and concludes with the statement that “Broadway is in the midst of its new Golden Age,” is already passé even at the moment of publication. Still, it makes for a jolly read. It’s a follow-up to Mr. Riedel’s successful “Razzle Dazzle: The Battle for Broadway” (2015),  which provided an insider’s look at 1970s and ’80s Broadway, primarily through the perspective of the powerful Shubert Organization. By the late ’60s, the rise of rock music had made the Broadway musical seem obsolete: “An art form that once produced the greatest of American songwriters no longer attracted them.” “Razzle Dazzle” took readers from this crisis point, which coincided with white flight from the city and the encroaching sleaze of Times Square, to Broadway’s reassertion of its unique identity—beginning with the musical “A Chorus Line” (1975), which almost singlehandedly revived the genre. Mr. Riedel ended that volume in the 1990s with the death of Bernard B. Jacobs, who with Gerald Schoenfeld, had helmed the Shubert Organization—the duo known to insiders as Bernie and Jerry, or simply, “the Shuberts.”<br />The revitalization of Broadway went hand-in-hand with the post-rock reinvention of the musical (Mr. Riedel gives only minimal space to straight plays), with hits like “Annie,” “42nd Street,” “Dreamgirls,” and “Nine” following “A Chorus Line.” And starting with 1970’s “Company,” Stephen Sondheim had shown the way to expanded psychological possibilities for the genre. But theatrical geniuses were, as ever, rare, and the deaths of Michael Bennett, Bob Fosse and Gower Champion within just a few years of each other, along with Jerome Robbins’s decision to devote all his time to the New York City Ballet, left Broadway bereft of great director-choreographers. “And who’s in sight to take their places?” Bernie Jacobs inquired piteously. The answer was already on the horizon. “The dance-driven American musical was about to give way to the British pop opera.” The age of Andrew Lloyd Webber had begun.<br />Without the focal point of the Shuberts, “Singular Sensation” lacks the unity and through-story of “Razzle Dazzle,” but it excels in giving the reader a fly-on-the-wall view of backstage infighting, struggles, and victories. As a longtime theater columnist, first for the New York Daily News and then for the New York Post, Mr. Riedel can spin a yarn with zest. Creating, rehearsing and mounting even a mediocre Broadway musical is an epic process, more difficult than outsiders can imagine, and Mr. Riedel presents some of these stories in gruesome detail. “Sunset Boulevard,” for example, shows many of its key players at their worst. Mr. Lloyd Webber comes off as extremely hubristic: Reflecting on the brilliant Billy Wilder movie he would base his musical on, he decided to take the plot to greater extremes. “We went much further than the film,” he said smugly. Part of the problem, no? Then, having hired Patti LuPone for the role of Norma Desmond in London, he didn’t have the nerve to tell her he was casting Glenn Close for the American productions. Hell, as we know, hath no fury like a diva scorned, and “the feud between Patti LuPone and Andrew Lloyd Webber gripped the theater world for years to come.” (That sentence alone constitutes proof of just how provincial and hermetic the theater world is.)<br />Mr. Riedel devotes a couple of moving chapters to the saga of “Rent,” the brainchild of a passionate young writer-composer named Jonathan Larson, who wrote the show while working as a waiter at the Moondance Diner on Sixth Avenue, developed it painstakingly at the off-Broadway New York Theatre Workshop, then died of an aortic dissection, at 35, just before the show’s triumphant first preview.</td>

      <td>Selected by the author of the Constable Twitten mystery series.</td>
      <td>By Patrick Hamilton (1941)<br />1. “To those whom God has forsaken is given a gas-fire in Earl’s Court.” So writes the British Patrick Hamilton, in this, his masterpiece, “Hangover Square.” In 1956 the poet John Betjeman described Hamilton as a writer of “the top class of English novels” while admitting that he knew nothing whatever about him. Hamilton was an outsider and so were his subjects—people whose idea of life was to make it from one pub to the next. In this tense and brilliant novel set in the late 1930s, we meet the unforgettable George Harvey Bone—a huge, unhappy shambles of a man tossed from one vivid mental state to another by excesses of booze. He’s besotted with the equally unforgettable Netta Longdon, whom he’s nonetheless driven to kill. The novel strongly suggests a reason: “The girl wore her attractiveness not as a girl should . . . but rather as a murderous utensil with which she might wound indiscriminately.” There is no missing the novel’s artfully achieved echo of history—particularly the efforts to appease Nazi Germany prior to World War II. Netta may not be a Nazi, but there’s something pointedly familiar, by design, about the way George is subjected to ever-increasing depths of humiliation by the selfish Netta. Until he acts.<br />By Muriel Spark (1970)<br />2. In the year she published “The Driver’s Seat,” Muriel Spark wrote, “I advocate the arts of satire and of ridicule.” As if to prove it, she wrote this absorbing novella, described by the novelist David Lodge as “a crime story turned inside out.” It is a masterpiece of inversion, one that takes the elements of a normal crime story—a woman’s body found—and reverses them all. Victim Lise, who flies to a southern European city seemingly in search of her murderer, wears garish clothes, creates a trail of incidents and makes odd, Samuel Beckett-type comments as if to provide the material for witness statements. “You’re not my type,” she tells the pushy men who try to pair off with her—which, we learn, is code for “You’re not my murderer.” Finally, she meets her “type” and the grisly crime—her killing—occurs, under her detailed instruction. Doctoral dissertations have been written on this short novel, which was intended to satirize the style of the then-fashionable French nouveau roman. But the question Spark artfully raises in it is a timeless one: Who is in the driver’s seat in this (or any) book?<br />By Jill Dawson (2000)</td>

      <td>Reading Shirley Hazzard’s fiction and essays is a bracing confrontation with a fearless mind.</td>
      <td>Just as excellence can, in certain moods, strike us as a reproach, Shirley Hazzard has a way of unnerving the unready. For Hazzard, who died in 2016 at the age of 85, writing was a toweringly moral enterprise whose central drama is played out continuously on the level of the sentence. The sloppy construction, the cant phrase, the parroted opinion—these represent unforgivable derelictions of duty. In a 1982 essay lamenting what she viewed as a rise in corporatism and groupthink, Hazzard wrote: “There is at least one immense truth we can still adhere to and make central to our lives—responsibility to the accurate word.” Reading her lucid, witty, attentive and fearlessly candid books one is uncomfortably reminded of Thoreau’s admonition that “there is never an instant’s truce between virtue and vice.”<br />These rigorous standards were not divisible from Hazzard’s life, which was organized around art and ideas. A passionate autodidact, Hazzard grew up in Australia but resided for most of her life in New York and Italy. With her husband, the great Flaubert biographer Francis Steegmuller (whom she met at a party thrown by Muriel Spark), she discreetly occupied the hub of the postwar intellectual world. Impeccably finished novels appeared at tasteful intervals, notably “The Bay of Noon,” in 1970, “The Transit of Venus,” in 1980, and “The Great Fire,” for which she received the 2003 National Book Award and came to the belated notice of a generation of readers accustomed to more from their authors in the way of self-promotion.<br />Less known than these books, but certainly no less accomplished, is Hazzard’s short fiction, nearly all of which appeared in the New Yorker, and which has now been brought together by editor Brigitta Olubas in the volume “Collected Stories” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 356 pages, $28). Along with a handful of uncollected and previously unpublished stories are the contents of her 1963 debut, “Cliffs of Fall,” and the linked sketches satirizing the United Nations in “People in Glass Houses,” from 1967.<br />“Cliffs of Fall” is concerned with love triangles of different angles and ratios. Hazzard is as interested in true heartache as in comedic infatuation, and the layering of sentiment and irony produces a complex choral effect. “You learned—it was all understood—that you must not forfeit any advantage, and that love itself was a subtle game of stoutly maintaining or judiciously yielding your position,” one character thinks, wryly pondering the embittered state of her marriage. Men usually hold the levers of power by dint of the self-righteousness that is expected from their gender, but women can master the game as well. “It is really quite easy to have the advantage over people,” one realizes. “You just have to keep quiet and look at them.”<br />Cynicism occasions Hazzard’s most memorable aphorisms, but her allegiances ultimately lie not with the wised-up but the vulnerable and devoted. Abandonment to love is akin, in these stories, to submission to an eternal work of art. The beauty and pathos derived from the surrender belong to a higher order of experience. When a married man ending things with his mistress tells her how much he owes her, the placating comment creates a moment of revelatory abjection. “This admission seemed to her to set the seal on the dissolution of their love: total indebtedness could only be acknowledged where no attempt at repayment was contemplated.”</td>

      <td>Six new books to help make at-home holidays bright.</td>
      <td>Why is this holiday season different from any other holiday season? Unfortunately, we all know the answer to that. Instead of socializing and traveling in the run-up to Hanukkah and Christmas, most of us will be in sedentary seclusion. Fortunately, some things don’t have to change. Families can still fry latkes and light menorahs, or set up creches and build gingerbread houses (or do all these things), and in the evening children can still snuggle up with festive picture books.<br />For Jewish households, Leslie Kimmelman presents an affectionate Judeo-medieval mash-up in “The Eight Knights of Hanukkah” (Holiday House, 40 pages, $17.99), a picture book about deeds of “awesome kindness and stupendous bravery.” As we see in Galia Bernstein’s droll cartoon illustrations, on the last day of Hanukkah a dastardly dragon is plaguing a kingdom, gobbling all the doughnuts, swooping over orchards and roasting the unpicked apples, and scorching the Hebrew letters off children’s dreidels. A cohort of mail-clad champions, at the behest of their mother, sets out on horseback to put the kingdom in order. Alone and severally, the knights perform goodly fixes: Sir Gabriel, for example, valiantly peels a massive pile of spuds (the usual potato-peelers having fled for fear of the dragon); his apron reads, “Kisseth the cook.” If the ending feels a little pat, well, never mind: Who wouldn’t want a dragon to light the Hanukkah candles?<br />Two admired figures in the world of children’s literature have combined forces for a joyfully syncretic picture book about a roving spirit of seasonal plenty, Nate Gadol, whose surname means “great” in Hebrew. Written by Arthur A. Levine and illustrated by Kevin Hawkes, “The Hanukkah Magic of Nate Gadol” (Candlewick, 30 pages, $19.99) is as much a celebration of the American melting pot as it is the story of a specific character. And what a character! In his bright blue greatcoat and ornate boots (see below), Nate Gadol travels unseen across continents and through centuries: “In answer to people’s prayers, he made things last as long as they needed to.”<br />Evidently Nate was in Judea with the Maccabees more than 2,000 years ago, ensuring that their tiny reserve of oil burned for eight days and nights—the original Hanukkah miracle. And he’s active in the American winter of 1881, when two impoverished immigrant families, the Jewish Glasers and the Catholic O’Malleys, are in need of help. Mr. Hawkes’s pictures for this inviting tale have sweep and warmth, with rich coloring and touches of gold that give even scenes of chilly privation a sumptuous appearance. In an afterword, Mr. Levine writes of his desire to expand the “wonderful supplementary mythology” of stories connected with the celebrations of Christmas and Hanukkah. It is an ambition achieved in this delightful book for readers ages 4-9.<br />For another tale of Yuletide generosity, Tad Hills uses colors so glowing that it’s as though the pages are strung with Christmas-tree lights. “Mistletoe” (Schwartz & Wade, 32 pages, $17.99) features an eponymous gray mouse who can’t seem to induce her great friend, Norwell, to come outside into the cold to enjoy the snow. Norwell, an elephant, demurs: “I think I’ll stay home, where it’s cozy.” When Mistletoe realizes why Norwell is so reluctant, she gets busy with knitting needles and yarn. As Christmas approaches, she knits at every possible moment, even “in the bath (which isn’t easy).” A humorous reveal at the end shows how far friendship—and yarn— can extend in this picture book for children ages 2-6.</td>
