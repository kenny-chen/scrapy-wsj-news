      <td>LOS ANGELES—Britney Spears retained a new lawyer, Greenberg Traurig LLP’s Mathew Rosengart, Wednesday who promised to petition the court to remove Ms. Spears’s father, James Spears, from his role as her conservator.<br />At the hearing, in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Judge Brenda Penny accepted the resignation of Ms. Spears’s prior court-appointed attorney, Samuel Ingham III, and she acknowledged Mr. Rosengart as her new lawyer.<br />The hearing marked the next steps in the 39-year-old pop star’s effort to reclaim more control over her life and $60 million estate 13 years into a conservatorship that put Mr. Spears at the helm.<br />Ms. Spears addressed the court via phone and fell into tears at the end of another emotional testimony two weeks after an earlier hearing in which she railed against her father and her legal predicament. In this hearing, she repeatedly asked Judge Penny to remove her father from the conservatorship immediately and to investigate him for “abuse.” Ms. Spears described years of being overworked and restricted in her freedom to do anything from take hair vitamins, to drink coffee, to eat a hamburger and french fries.<br />She described her circumstances as “f---ing cruelty.” “If this is not abuse I don’t know what is.”</td>

Some demonstrators blocked a highway on Tuesday, while others a day earlier sought to dispatch boats laden with supplies to Cuba. Many call for the U.S. to intervene militarily.<br />“I think we need to consider it,” Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who is Cuban-American, said. “We have the ability, like we did in Panama, to depose a dictatorship and create a democracy.”<br />Haitian-Americans gathered last week at the Little Haiti Cultural Center to discuss potential responses to the unrest provoked by the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse. Many are pressing the Biden administration for more-lenient immigration policies to help people fleeing Haiti. Some argue against deploying U.S. troops to the country, though in Haiti some officials have beseeched the U.S. to bring order.<br />“It could further inflame the situation,” said Krystina François, the Haitian-American executive director of the Office of New Americans of Miami-Dade, which promotes civic engagement. “We’re asking not to rush to elections. We need to build up confidence for the democratic process.”</td>

      <td>The $4.1 trillion budget strategy: please Bernie, squeeze the moderates.</td>
      <td>The price of Republicans losing those two Georgia Senate seats in January was always going to be steep, and late Tuesday Democrats presented America with the bill: $4.1 trillion. That’s how much in new taxes and spending President Biden, Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi hope to ram through Congress with the narrowest majorities in decades.<br />Senate Democrats announced that they’ve agreed on a top-line budget resolution total of $3.5 trillion. They hope to pass this with 50 Senate Democrats plus Vice President Kamala Harris to break the tie. That’s in addition to the $600 billion or so in net spending in the bipartisan infrastructure framework.<br />Don’t believe the spin that this is a compromise from the $6 trillion that Mr. Sanders floated some weeks ago. That was a feint to make the final number appear more moderate. This would be the largest spending increase in U.S. history, and a huge increase in the size and scope of government. It would lift federal spending as a share of GDP to more than 25% from the modern norm of 20% to 21% or so. Democrats are going for broke—literally.<br />“Every major program that President Biden has asked us for is funded in a robust way. And we are making some additions to that,” crowed Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, standing next to Mr. Sanders. “Most important, something that Senator Sanders has led, and convinced America is so important, which is a robust expansion of Medicare, including money for dental, vision and hearing.”<br />Mr. Schumer didn’t mention the cost of this new Medicare fillip: about $300 billion. And for a Medicare entitlement that the Trustees in their annual report say will already start to run out of money as early as 2024.</td>

      <td>An ugly example in Boston of bias against Asian-Americans.</td>
      <td>Here’s a sign of the progressive times. On Friday federal judge William Young withdrew an earlier opinion approving a temporary new admissions plan for three elite Boston public schools. The new plan substitutes grades and zip codes for a competitive entrance exam, which appears designed to reduce the number of white and Asian-American students.<br />Judge Young said he took this extraordinary step—the first in his 36-year judicial career—because the school system’s attorneys had misled him by excluding from the court racially charged text messages sent by two Boston School Committee members involved in the admissions decision.<br />The texts were sent during the virtual meeting when the admissions changes were approved, and they suggest there was racial animus behind the decision. Committee member Lorna Rivera, for example, sent a message to fellow member Alexandra Oliver-Dávila saying she was “sick of westie whites.”<br />“Me too,” Ms. Oliver-Dávila replied. “I really feel like saying that.” Committee chairman Michael Loconto mocked the Asian names of some of those who commented.<br />All three have since resigned, and the Boston Parent Coalition for Academic Excellence is hoping the judge will formally reopen the case. Though Judge Young makes clear he may not change his ultimate conclusion, he has also suggested that withholding these texts from the court record is “potentially fraud on the Court.”</td>

      <td>Brussels wants you to know that Europe’s finest bureaucrats are Thinking Big about climate change, and on Wednesday they released a comprehensive regulatory and spending plan to prove it. Call it an awe-and-shock strategy: They hope voters will be so awe-struck at its grand ambitions that they won’t have time to be shocked by what’s in it.<br />Called “Fit for 55,” the European Commission says the aim of its program is to reduce the European Union’s carbon emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030. This is supposed to put Europe on track to become “the world’s first climate-neutral continent” by 2050. The big Brussels reveal consists of hundreds upon hundreds of pages of proposed legal changes and spending commitments.<br />The trouble will be what’s in the fine print. The headline pledges will be difficult enough. Brussels wants to ban sales of new internal-combustion cars by 2035 and subject aviation to the EU’s emissions-trading system—good luck taking a vacation on a budget.<br />Another proposal requires enormous expenditures to boost energy efficiency. There’s a renewable-energy directive, and an update to the regulation on land use, forestry and agriculture (requiring, among many other things, planting three billion trees by 2030).<br />Most of this won’t happen soon, or in this form. Industry groups started furiously picking Fit for 55 apart before it was even released. They’ll be sure to tell the national governments that have to approve this legislative Hydra about all the ways this package will be bad for job creation. They have a point, especially for industries such as aviation already nearly bankrupted by the pandemic. Governments will quail at the costs as they struggle to manage pandemic spending and debt.</td>

      <td>Deregulating the market will spur competition and reduce prices.</td>
      <td>There aren’t many things that President Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump agree on, but here’s one: Breaking down regulatory barriers to competition in hearing aids.<br />President Biden’s executive order on Friday instructed the Health and Human Services Secretary to expedite a rule-making that will allow Americans to purchase hearing aids over the counter rather than by prescription. That’s the same way you can buy reading glasses. The goal is to open up the industry—the four largest manufacturers control 84% of the market—to more competition and thus reduce prices.<br />As Mr. Biden’s order noted, a pair of hearing aids can cost about $5,000 and isn’t covered by Medicare or most private insurers. One result is that some 40 million Americans with hearing loss don’t use hearing aids. People can buy less expensive personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) without prescriptions, but they aren’t as effective or adjustable.<br />The hearing-aid oligopoly and a cartel of medical professionals have long fought direct-to-consumer sales. Note that the actual hearing-aid accounts for only about a third of what consumers pay. Licensed audiologists often contract with two or three manufacturers and then bundle the cost of the device with other fees and services.<br />In 2019 the average retail price for a hearing aid was $2,284 compared to the $774 wholesale cost of the device. Requiring prescriptions for hearing aids boosts margins of medical specialists. Allowing the devices to be purchased over the counter will expand the consumer market and encourage more competition in manufacturing, thereby driving down the wholesale price of devices too.</td>

They will seek to codify the agreement on the top-line spending figure into a budget resolution in the coming weeks and get it approved by Congress.  The number marks a middle ground between the $6 trillion package some progressives were seeking and the roughly $2 trillion figure backed by some centrists.<br /><br />The legislation Democrats are preparing is expected to include paid family and medical leave, subsidized child care, an extension of an expanded child tax credit, universal prekindergarten for three and four-year-olds and affordable housing, among other issues. It would also extend expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies  approved earlier this year in the Covid-19 aid package.</td>

Then one day, I had a radical thought while watching Molly labor over a puzzle.<br />Perhaps it was because she was working on an image of the azalea-shrouded 13th green at Augusta National Golf Club, beauty I could readily appreciate.

      <td>Abraham Lincoln’s union with Mary Todd was not a happy one, but it may have honed his ability to guide a nation through crisis.</td>
      <td>‘Poor Mrs. Lincoln!”<br />Those words were uttered time and again after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, as mourners expressed pity for the woman who had seen her husband murdered before her eyes. From around the world, condolence letters flooded the White House, but such outpourings of sympathy proved short-lived deviations from all that had come before and all that would come after. In “An American Marriage: The Untold Story of Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd,” the eminent Lincoln scholar Michael Burlingame has amassed an avalanche of insults directed at Mary Lincoln. She was, according to a panoply of people who interacted with her, cold, coarse, savage, repulsive and brutal. She was a fool, a shrew, a she-devil, a hellion and a hyena. In the index of Mr. Burlingame’s two-volume, prize-winning “Abraham Lincoln: A Life,” under “Lincoln, Abraham—Marriage and Domestic Life—relations with MTL” can be found the subentries “bad temper,” “ ‘home was hell’ ” and “not a good cook or hostess.” Now this provocative, compulsively readable book sets out to demonstrate that Abraham Lincoln’s sorrows—often attributed to the challenge of leading the nation through civil war—must be ascribed also to the horror of his domestic life.<br />The most enlightening questions historians can ask are “why” questions, and scattered within this catalog of defamation, Mr. Burlingame notes Mary Lincoln’s unhappy childhood and her “profoundly dislocating losses.” One son died at the age of 3, another at 11 (after the assassination, a third son died at 18; only Robert Todd Lincoln survived his mother). Mr. Burlingame writes of her “hunger for ersatz forms of love—power, money, fame”—and of the “unconscious rage” she directed toward her husband. People at the time also described Mrs. Lincoln as demented, deranged, crazy and insane, and Mr. Burlingame convincingly offers a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, noting that numerous Todd relatives displayed symptoms of the same illness. The narrative ends in 1865; Robert would commit his mother to an insane asylum, against her wishes, 10 years later.<br />Mr. Burlingame is writing against what he calls Mary Lincoln’s “defensive” biographers: those who have presented the Lincoln marriage as happy or the First Lady as a feminist ahead of her time. While he makes clear that the “depressive, emotionally reserved and uncommunicative” Mr. Lincoln was “far from an ideal husband” (his childhood was unhappy too), Mr. Burlingame’s sympathies ultimately lie with him. Observers judged Mr. Lincoln as patient with his wife, but also as meek and browbeaten. Some wondered at his inability to control her, and others questioned his manhood, impressions that Mr. Burlingame offers without historical analysis. To his credit, Mr. Burlingame admits the need for something he does not supply: “a modern, thorough, psychologically sophisticated biography” of Mary Lincoln. Future scholars would do well, too, to consider her critics in light of cultural expectations about women, men, politics and marriage. To give just one example, neighbors found it outrageous that Mary Lincoln implored her husband to look after the children.<br />A few aspects of the book deserve closer scrutiny. When Mr. Burlingame writes of Mary Lincoln’s physical abuse of her husband, he cites a 2018 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey to claim “that more men than women were the victims of domestic violence in 2015,” although that contradicts the report’s conclusions. A chapter called “The First Lady and African Americans” refutes previous contentions of Mrs. Lincoln as an abolitionist, claiming that her conduct toward black people “belies that characterization,” even though black abolitionists often attested that their white allies were hardly innocent of routine racism. Moreover, by the time we get to this chapter, it is well-established that Mary Lincoln treated nearly everyone in her orbit with disdain.</td>

      <td>How Irving Stone (and Charlton Heston) taught the world to know the man</td>
      <td>Like Shakespeare and Beethoven, Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) is one of those giants of Western culture who is known by only one name—and not just to highbrows but pretty much everybody. Even those whose awareness of the visual arts is restricted to the Mona Lisa and “The Last Supper” are more than likely to also know that Michelangelo was the sculptor of “David” and the painter of the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel ceiling. That double-barreled fact is the measure of his fame. But how do they know about Michelangelo? And how, for that matter, do they know Hamlet’s “To be or not to be” soliloquy or the first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth? It’s been a long time since you could count on our schools to teach such things, or even to introduce their students to the notion of artistic greatness itself.<br />For Americans over 50 years old, the answer is a phenomenon called “middlebrow culture” that was fostered by radio, TV, magazines and the movies. From the ’30s until well into the ’70s, high culture was generally portrayed by the media not dismissively but with unironic respect—and in such a way as to suggest that anyone with a public-school education could enjoy it.<br />In the case of Michelangelo, it was a novelist who made all the difference. Sixty years ago, Irving Stone, who specialized in novels about great men and women of the past, published “The Agony and the Ecstasy: A Biographical Novel of Michelangelo,” a hefty but immensely readable and meticulously researched book. (Stone even studied marble carving in preparation for writing it.) In later years, the kitschy-sounding title has caused many to view the book with understandable suspicion, and it doesn’t help that Stone’s prose style occasionally ran to the purple. But that isn’t important in the end, for “The Agony and the Ecstasy” is deeply informed in every possible way: To read it is to learn the fundamentals of Michelangelo’s life and art, and to do so in a genuinely entertaining yet deeply respectful way.<br />Much the same things can be said of Carol Reed’s 1965 screen version, in which Charlton Heston, an actor whose gifts are now similarly undervalued, plays the artist wonderfully well. Heston left behind a vivid account of the experience in his 1995 memoir “In the Arena,” explaining how the studio built a duplicate of the Sistine Chapel, putting a photographic reproduction of Michelangelo’s fresco on the ceiling, then covering it with blue paint so that Heston could appear to be painting it himself by removing the covering bit by bit. (He even lay on his back on a duplicate of the scaffolding used by Michelangelo.) To watch “The Agony and the Ecstasy” is to be given a privileged close-up glimpse of a great painter at work.<br />What happened to such exercises in the development of middlebrow taste? In the case of TV, they migrated to public television, then largely disappeared. Robert Hughes, for many years Time magazine’s art critic and himself one of the finest of middlebrow educators, both in Time and on PBS’s 1980 TV series “The Shock of the New,” wrote savagely in “The Spectacle of Skill,” a posthumous collection of his selected writings, of how William Paley, the president of CBS, was offered the U.S. broadcast rights to the BBC’s “Civilisation,” the 13-part 1969 TV series in which Kenneth Clark, the British art historian, recounted a thousand years of Western cultural history. Paley, himself a noted collector of modern art, later told Hughes that he’d turned “Civilisation” down flat, assuming that “its commercial prospects . . .were too slight.” Soon afterward, he pulled Leonard Bernstein’s Young People’s Concerts out of their prime-time slot and quickly scuttled CBS’ other high-culture offerings, preferring to milk the cash cow of sitcoms and cops-and-robbers shows. But he was wrong about “Civilisation,” which put PBS on the map for the first time in its then-brief history—and the work of Michelangelo, needless to say, was prominently featured therein. (The first shot of the first episode is of “David,” with the music of Bach playing in the background.)</td>

Mr. Adams also met this week with President Biden, who is working to counter rising crime in American cities amid criticism from Republicans who contend that Democrats have failed to sufficiently respond.<br />Mr. Adams said Wednesday that it was important to make clear that crimes would have consequences and to focus resources on preventing crimes motivated by poverty.<br />“Give those young people who are carrying a gun the real services they need and identify the services beforehand. You have to have intervention and prevention,” Mr. Adams said.</td>

      <td>Three years after his death by suicide, a documentary attempts to take the measure of the larger-than-life man.</td>
      <td>Early in Morgan Neville’s enthralling and unsettling “Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain,” a documentary feature playing in theaters, the filmmaker is heard speaking softly behind the camera. Gossip isn’t what he’s after, he assures an uneasy interview subject in a reference to the tabloid scandal that broke shortly before Bourdain’s death: “I want to make a film about why he was who he was.”<br />The whys of that life include why the cook-turned-chef-turned-writer and media star burned so bright, was so avid for experience, was loved by so many who knew him and by so many more who read his zestful words and followed his extravagant adventures. Inevitably, of course, they’re overshadowed by why he, of all irrepressible spirits, committed suicide three years ago, at age 61, by hanging himself in his room in a French hotel. Unable to penetrate that mystery, the film touches briefly on the scandal without proposing it as the answer. Still, Mr. Neville, who won an Oscar for the 2013 documentary “Twenty Feet From Stardom,” leaves us with a vivid, thoroughly satisfying sense of the man Bourdain was as well as the one he seemed to be.<br />Sometimes the two coincided. In film clips from the late 1990s, during Bourdain’s tenure as an executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in New York, he’s the same brash, funny, alluring, articulate, supersmart, self-ironic and immensely likable prodigy of energy he continued to be for much of his life. Where the person and the persona begin to diverge in Mr. Neville’s documentary portrait is after the suddenly celebrated author of “Kitchen Confidential” hits the road for a TV food and travel show whose various iterations will span—and pretty much consume—16 years of his life. Bourdain, a natural storyteller, loves the new medium and takes to it quickly, though not without a steepening cost to himself and others. While the most affecting interviews in the film are with his friends and his second wife, Ottavia Busia-Bourdain, the most revealing are with the producers, directors and crew who worked with him across all those years and miles and watched him grow and change.<br />Some of the changes are unsurprising, the consequence of an exhilarating but exhausting process that Bourdain later describes as “airport to airport, city to city—I’m starting to feel like a modern-day Willy Loman.” Far from starring in his own version of “Death of a Salesman,” the peregrinating host thrives on scarfing exotic foods—one of his producers calls his eating a live, beating cobra heart “a little salacious”—engaging effortlessly with fascinating people and immersing himself, however briefly, in cultures that were as foreign to him as to his viewers. That’s a surprise. The world traveler, the film tells us, hadn’t traveled before the advent of his first series, “A Cook’s Tour.” What he knew of other lands came mostly from movies and books, which enhanced his already voracious appetite for the real thing.<br />It’s hardly a surprise that appetite would figure prominently in a documentary about a chef who eats—and smokes and drinks and charms—his way around the world. But there are appetites for nourishment, and those for experience, and what makes Mr. Neville’s film change from beguiling to troubling to heartbreaking and frightening is his subject’s insatiable hunger for extreme experience. It’s not just the rigors of the road, the 250 days of travel each year that wreak havoc on Bourdain’s two marriages and the family life he cherishes. “People forget that Anthony Bourdain was a junkie,” says his friend the artist and self-described junkie David Choe. “It jumped. The addiction jumped.”Those five chilling words go a long way toward explaining the film’s latter stretches.</td>

The billion-dollar total also reflects the bar set by pledges previously announced by Snap Inc.’s Snapchat, Google’s YouTube and Bytedance Ltd.’s TikTok.<br />Facebook said creators can receive payments for hitting certain milestones when using its products.The company also plans to provide seed funding to help creators cover content-production costs for its platforms. The programs will start on an invitation-only basis, Facebook said, without providing details such as timing or qualifications needed to participate.<br />It isn’t immediately clear yet, though, whether these bets will drive long-term loyalty among creators. People can build audiences on a variety of platforms, and the incentives being doled out to use them are fast-changing.<br />Savvy content creators have become a crucial part of the global social-networking landscape in recent years, helping platforms like TikTok and  Amazon.com Inc.’s  Twitch grow in popularity. Anyone can become a star overnight on these internet hubs, and the companies behind them are eager to appeal to the most popular creators to stand out from their rivals.</td>

It also offers a glimmer of hope for the thousands of people who each year lose the ability to speak as a result of injury or illness.<br />Yet the limitations of the so-called speech neuroprosthesis indicate that brain-computer interface technology—in which tiny electrical signals from the brain are converted into actions in the physical world like speaking, typing or controlling a computer cursor—remains in its infancy. In recent years the technology has drawn the attention of academic scientists as well as techcompanies that hope to commercialize it, including Elon Musk’s Neuralink Corp., Kernel and  Facebook Inc.<br />Facebook is a sponsor of the new research and said in a blog post that it was eager for the development of a noninvasive, wearable device that could allow people to type by thinking.<br />To test their neuroprosthesis, the University of California, San Francisco researchers enlisted the help of a man in his 30s who had lost the ability to speak as a result of paralysis caused by a severe stroke suffered more than 15 years ago. The man, who now communicates by using a cap-worn pointer to tap out individual letters on a screen, agreed to have a small rectangular array of electrodes surgically attached to the outer surface of his brain.</td>

The report said the improvement came as consumers spent more on tourism, travel and other services that were restricted earlier in the pandemic.<br />Employers throughout the country also saw varying job gains, with many noting difficulties in finding workers. Wages increased at a moderate pace and demand for low-skilled workers rose, suggesting workers have increased leverage in a tight labor market.</td>

Democrats hope to use a process tied to the budget known as reconciliation to pass the package without GOP support, but will have to maintain total unity in their ranks to advance it through the evenly divided Senate.<br />“We’re gonna get this done,” Mr. Biden said Wednesday in the Capitol, pumping his fist as he entered a lunchtime meeting with Senate Democrats where he endorsed the $3.5 trillion plan and stressed the importance of unity, according to lawmakers.<br />The $3.5 trillion agreement was bigger than some centrist Democrats had sought, but marked a softening in the stance of Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), who had originally pursued a $6 trillion package. Many moderate Senate Democrats, including Sens. Jon Tester of Montana, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, said they were still reviewing details of the agreement. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) said he raised concerns about the package’s impact on inflation and its climate-change provisions during the lunch meeting.<br />The bill is expected to include broad tax credits for clean energy investments and liberal Democrats are pressing to end subsidies for fossil fuels.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—FBI agents disregarded allegations by Olympic gymnasts that they were sexually assaulted by former national team doctor Larry Nassar and later made false statements to cover their mistakes, Justice Department investigators said Wednesday in a long-awaited report on the bureau’s handling of one of the biggest abuse cases in U.S. sports history.<br />The Justice Department’s inspector general detailed multiple failings in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s response to the gymnasts’ complaints, which were first brought into the Indianapolis field office on July 28, 2015, by USA Gymnastics, the sport’s national governing body. For more than a year after that, the bureau did almost nothing in response.<br />The Indianapolis agents receive the brunt of the blame: according to the report, agents there were unsure if the allegations against Nassar represented a possible federal crime. They were also unsure how to handle concerns that had been brought to them in Indianapolis—the city where USA Gymnastics is headquartered—when there were no allegations of Nassar treating gymnasts there.<br />Nassar, now serving an effective life term in prison, was later established to have sexually abused hundreds of women and girls—including members of the U.S. national gymnastics team—under the guise of medical treatment. The abuse occurred in training and competitions around the country and overseas, and through his employment at Michigan State University.<br />According to the report, the Indianapolis agents did not formally document their July 2015 meeting with the USA Gymnastics officials, which came after the gymnastics body had conducted its own five-week internal inquiry into concerns about Nassar.</td>

      <td>Will American teachers stand up and reject the destructive ideologies backed by their unions?</td>
      <td>The conceit at the heart of the campaign to embed critical race theory in American education is that U.S. schools have been teaching a whitewashed version of our nation’s history, a nationalistic rendering that ignores the country’s flaws. But of course anyone educated in the U.S. knows that left-leaning academics who are highly skeptical of American tradition have been dominating the field for generations. The current battle is really about whether largely factual critiques of America written by liberals will now be replaced by anti-American screeds written by propagandists who aren’t particularly concerned with accuracy.<br />This column has been hoping that the mostly liberal teachers who stand at the front of America’s classrooms will be roused to declare—loudly— that they are not Marxists or racialists and do not endorse the fact-challenged radicalism now being promoted by their union leadership. Today brings some cause for optimism, and also a healthy reminder that the lessons to be swept aside to make way for the new propaganda are ones that Americans of both parties will recognize as highly valuable.<br />This column recently noted the resolution adopted by the National Education Association, the country’s leading teachers union, pledging to  “oppose attempts to ban critical race theory and/or The 1619 Project” despite the significant errors in the project identified by historians across the political spectrum. The union also pledged to join “with Black Lives Matter at School and the Zinn Education Project” to call for “a national day of action to teach lessons about structural racism and oppression.” Howard Zinn was a Marxist opponent of American liberty whose rantings carried more respect among Hollywood celebrities than professional historians.<br />As for critical race theory, a veteran English teacher in Rhode Island public schools named Ramona Bessinger writes at the Legal Insurrection website about her experience when a new curriculum came to town:<br />Ms. Bessinger helpfully punctures the myth that current curricula are chock full of authors blind to American faults and historical sins:</td>

      <td>Fentanyl, along with isolation and stress from Covid-19 pandemic, propelled surge, experts say</td>
      <td>Drug-overdose deaths in the U.S. surged nearly 30% in 2020, the result of a deadlier supply and the destabilizing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to preliminary federal data and public health officials.<br />The estimated 93,331 deaths from drug overdoses last year, a record high, represent the sharpest annual increase in at least three decades, and compare with an estimated toll of 72,151 deaths in 2019, according to provisional overdose-drug data released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />“That is a stunning number even for those of us who have tracked this issue,” said Brendan Saloner, associate professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Our public health tools have not kept pace with the urgency of the crisis.”<br />The surge, the 2020 data show, was driven largely by a proliferation of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid whose use has spread across the nation. The pandemic amplified the epidemic of overdoses, bringing on social isolation, trauma and job losses, according to addiction experts and treatment providers. Overdose deaths began rising in the fall of 2019 with the spread of fentanyl, but really took off starting in March 2020, when pandemic-driven shutdowns and physical-distancing measures set in. “It’s really one of those things where 2020 turbocharged something that was already wildly out of control,” Dr. Saloner said.<br />Fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, is now frequently mixed into other widely used illicit drugs, often when the user is unaware. “Fentanyl is poisoning our drug supply,” said Monique Tula, executive director of the National Harm Reduction Coalition, an organization that advocates for people who use drugs and trains the harm reduction workforce.</td>

It provides a salty counterpoint to the tomatoes, dressed with tart pomegranate molasses, olive oil and fresh cilantro and parsley. “It just works,” said the chef. “I like the flavor of charred tomatoes and how juicy they get.”<br />The grilled bread comes in handy for mopping up all those juices, and its dusting of spice adds yet more layers of flavor. “Chaat masala is a seasoning with a little green mango for tartness, a little black salt for funkiness and three or four other spices,” Mr. Irani said.

      <td>JUST WHAT IS the problem with Marshmallow Fluff? It gets zero respect these days. I suppose that brand name doesn’t help. “Fluff” is, after all, the word we use for anything not to be taken seriously. So I’ll begin here by shifting to the generic term for this foodstuff that food snobs scorn: marshmallow creme. There. Does that sound French enough?<br />People seem to be OK with the marshmallow in its solid form. Maybe it’s the symbiotic relationship it has with the chocolate bar and the Graham cracker, transformed via campfire into the ever-popular s’more.<br />But I am here to praise the marshmallow in its primordial, formless form. Marshmallow creme has a marvelous capacity to adapt to the shape of our shifting desires. Swirl it into a milkshake for a lush consistency and intense vanilla flavor. Short on time to produce a showstopper dinner-party dessert? Artfully dollop some marshmallow creme atop a scoop of ice cream, blast it with a kitchen torch and call it baked Alaska.<br />This ingredient is as classic as Ivory soap—and, like that product, possessed of a pristine snowy-white visual appeal and a buoyancy both literal and poetical. Returning for a moment to my brand of choice, Marshmallow Fluff, the retro label is pretty great, too.<br />Marshmallow creme does have its die-hard devotees. One can attend the What the Fluff? festival each September in Somerville, Mass., and Oct. 8 has been designated National Fluffernutter Day in honor of the sandwich that pairs the sumptuous stuff with peanut butter.</td>

Citigroup said it didn’t expect a significant further decline in net interest revenue for the rest of this year. The KBW Nasdaq Bank index is down more than 2% since reporting began on Tuesday.<br />The cautious outlooks are a function of low rates and tepid loan growth, a problem across banking. But Citigroup is still making incremental progress on other longer-term projects. The bank said that its retail checking deposits grew 24% year-over-year. That is about what  Bank of America ,  a giant of U.S. retail banking, did over the same period in consumer banking, though on a bigger base.<br />Reorienting Citigroup more around U.S. consumer banking is a vital part of the bank’s effort to narrow its longstanding performance gap with peers. The bank also said it is now internally testing some features of its forthcoming digital account partnership with Alphabet’s Google.<br />Retail checking is one of the cheapest and stickiest forms of funding. Citi’s cost of deposits is falling but remains higher than those of some megabank peers, and that will likely persist as part of the nature of Citigroup’s more international deposit base. But the gap between them is narrowing, in part because other banks just can’t get much lower. Notably, Citigroup has lowered its average long-term debt liabilities versus a year ago, a much more expensive funding source.</td>

Yet, MI5 Director-General Ken McCallum said, Islamist terrorism still constitutes the agency’s largest operational mission and new challenges could arise as the U.S. and its allies depart from Afghanistan.<br />Mr. McCallum said Wednesday that the agency faces daily threats and espionage activities that predominantly come “in quite varying ways from state or state-backed organizations in Russia, China or Iran” that have to be managed alongside U.K. efforts at engagement with all three countries.<br />The threats are against individuals, digital infrastructure and espionage that is focused on the government but also on universities and businesses, he said. He also cited efforts at disinformation and attempts to seek hidden relationships with public figures, “hack-and-leak operations” aimed at having a political impact and troll farms seeking to sow and deepen divisions in society.<br />Mr. McCallum said the agency had identified more than 10,000 disguised approaches by foreign spies on professional social-media sites that sought to manipulate people in the U.K. where people in high-tech businesses, scientific research and exporting businesses were all of interest to foreign spies.</td>

      <td>Wealthy governments should pick up the tab for shots in poor countries, which benefit everyone.</td>
      <td>The innovative pharmaceutical industry confounded critics by delivering highly effective vaccines for a novel disease in less than a year. The vaccines are working against all known Covid-19 variants, although the newest variant features some unusual mutations. Resistant variants become more likely the longer the virus circulates. Wealthy nations are scrambling to vaccinate the world, but they need to pay for it instead of asking vaccine innovators for a free ride.<br />Wealthy countries have both selfish and altruistic reasons to help vaccinate developing countries. Developed countries want to prevent vaccine-resistant strains from cropping up. And they want to prevent human suffering, illness and death.<br />Less than 5% of Africans have been vaccinated, and infections and deaths are spiking. India, which suffered a spring surge and where vaccines are made under license from vaccine developers, has vaccinated less than 5% of its population. Vaccines are no longer scarce; the chief impediment for developing countries now is an inability to pay, including for the necessary infrastructure.<br />Vaccine makers have voluntarily waived the ordinarily high, patent-protected prices for their products.  AstraZeneca  and  Johnson & Johnson  both pledged to provide their vaccines on a nonprofit basis during the pandemic. Moderna and  Pfizer  are making profits but charging only $30 or $40 for a two-dose course, a reasonable price for lifesaving products that were the first to market.  Novavax ,  which is expected to seek Food and Drug Administration authorization soon, will only charge $3 a shot in Africa.<br />But the Biden administration’s initiative to waive intellectual-property protections for Covid-19 vaccines—supported by several European leaders and the World Health Organization—asks vaccine innovators to pay for more of the world’s gain from global vaccine distribution. If developed countries value vaccinating the world, they should subsidize vaccine production and distribution, not “tax” it by demanding that companies provide vaccines and intellectual property at prices below their value. Why should shareholders and employees of innovating firms pay for the benefit to all of us of world-wide distribution?</td>

      <td>Without the deregulation of the ’70s—which he supported—the economy would be smaller today.</td>
      <td>In a sweeping executive order aimed at reimposing Progressive Era regulatory policy across the U.S. economy, President Biden recounted the foundational myths of modern progressivism. The first canon of progressivism holds that breaking up the consolidating industries or trusts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and regulating those industries heavily until the late 1970s, benefited the economy and gave “the little guy” a fighting chance. Consumers, workers and the economy took a hit, according to the progressive myth, when the regulatory structure was overturned 40 years ago.<br />Progressive interpretation claims that the industrial concentration of the late 19th and early 20th centuries was evidence of the rise of monopolies, but if the consolidating industries were exhibiting anticompetitive behavior, output would have fallen and prices would have risen. The opposite happened. As economist Thomas DiLorenzo showed in a classic study, output in industries accused of being monopolistic during the debate on the Sherman Act in 1890 increased by 175% from 1880 to 1890—seven times the growth rate of the economy as a whole. The average price of products sold by these same industries fell three times as fast as the Consumer Price Index.<br />Hard economic data consistently shows that the industrial concentration at the turn of the 19th century was driven by vigorous competition arising from transformative technology and improved industrial organization. Efficient producers mastered the economies of scale to provide consumers with lower prices and improved product quality. Competition and new technology destroyed the pricing power of emerging trusts, and most failed to survive. Even the oil and sugar trusts, which existed because of protective tariffs, faced relentless price competition.<br />Many trusts welcomed progressive regulation. A comprehensive study by economist George Hilton and historian Gabriel Kolko showed convincingly that railroads championed regulation. They were more than happy to have the feds set freight rates. Market forces had driven down revenues per ton-mile by some 18% between 1870 and 1890. The first major action of the Interstate Commerce Commission was to ban price competition by outlawing price rebating, which the owners of an overbuilt railway system welcomed. When interstate trucking became an effective competitor of the railroads, the ICC muted that competition by regulating the new industry.<br />The 1970s brought two recessions, double-digit inflation and an end to America’s postwar economic dominance, setting off an intense policy debate. As economists, regulators, politicians, business leaders and policy advocates debated why the U.S. economy seemed to be losing its exceptionalism, a consensus formed around the belief that regulations based on the Progressive Era principles that Mr. Biden now seeks to revive were hurting consumers, workers and the economy.</td>

      <td>Protests over jailing of former leader have spiraled into unrest and looting that has interrupted transportation amid a record Covid-19 outbreak</td>
      <td>The arrest of former South African President Jacob Zuma this month has triggered looting and violence in the country’s two most populous provinces amid a record wave of Covid-19 infections.<br />Mr. Zuma was president of South Africa from 2009 until 2018, a time when alleged corruption escalated in government and the ruling African National Congress. After he resigned, a government-mandated commission started investigating some of these allegations, but Mr. Zuma repeatedly refused to testify, despite an order to do so from South Africa’s Constitutional Court. On June 29, the same court sentenced Mr. Zuma to 15 months in prison for contempt of court and he was arrested the following week.<br />Most of the violence and looting has been concentrated in Mr. Zuma’s home province of KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng, where South Africa’s economic capital Johannesburg and political capital Pretoria are located. Mobs have targeted shopping malls, factories and warehouses, many of them in impoverished townships, where residents have been hit hard by three brutal waves of Covid-19 infections and government-imposed lockdowns. Dozens of people have lost their lives. Traffic on the highway connecting the important port of Durban with Johannesburg—one of South Africa’s busiest transport routes—has also been interrupted. That has led to concerns over shortages of food and other essentials and could cause disruptions to exports from some of the country’s agricultural hubs and trade with other African economies as far afield as the Democratic Republic of Congo.<br />Mr. Zuma’s arrest was initially seen as a victory for his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, who has pledged to clean up South Africa’s government and the ruling ANC. But the escalating unrest has also drawn attention to continued factional fighting within the former liberation movement, where Mr. Zuma still commands support. On Monday, Mr. Ramaphosa deployed the army to back up overwhelmed police and other law-enforcement agencies, with limited success so far. He has called on South Africans not to join the violence and looting, which he says will further damage the economy and delay the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.<br />South Africa has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. It is currently in the middle of a third wave of Covid-19 infections, which has already surpassed the country’s two previous waves. Only around 2.5% of its 60 million people have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, so many are continuing to get sick and die. Government lockdowns that were supposed to stem transmission of the virus pushed the economy into its deepest recession on record last year, leading to increased hunger and poverty, and driving up an unemployment rate that stood at 33% at the end of March. Many of the looters say they are stealing to help provide for their families and to put pressure on a government that has failed to provide for them.</td>

      <td>Loss of SAS deal is reminder that chip maker’s pivot to software isn’t easy</td>
      <td>Broadcom ’s  pivot to software was never going to be easy, and it has grown only more difficult since that effort began.<br />Such is most evident in the company’s latest tack: The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Broadcom was in talks to buy privately held SAS Institute for as much as $20 billion. By late Tuesday, the deal was off—apparently due to a change of heart by SAS’s owners. Sources told the Journal that some employees expressed concern about how the perk-heavy culture at SAS would meld with a chip maker whose modus operandi is to squeeze out inefficiencies to maximize earnings. SAS’s owners reportedly distribute hundreds of pounds of free M&Ms across the company’s North Carolina campus every Wednesday.<br />Hyper-acquisitive Broadcom turned its sights to software in July 2018, when it announced a surprising deal to acquire CA Technologies for $18.9 billion. It has since picked up the enterprise security business of  Symantec  for $10.7 billion.<br />The CA deal came just four months after Broadcom lost its most ambitious chip gambit yet—a $117 billion hostile takeover bid for  Qualcomm  that was blocked by the Trump administration on national security grounds. That attempted deal became a tipping point in the semiconductor cold war between the U.S. and China, which in turn has made nearly impossible the type of large-scale chip deals Broadcom had come to rely on.<br />Rolling up software companies may not bring the same kind of political baggage. But it does have its challenges. Broadcom’s deal strategy has long centered on finding undervalued businesses that have strong market share within their categories, then maximizing the free cash flow of those acquired businesses.</td>

Maybe that’s because, as one of the southernmost points in the contiguous U.S., it feels more Caribbean than continental. Or perhaps it’s because raucous, sun-bleached bars flank Duval Street, its main drag. But don’t dismiss this city of around 24,000 as a party town. Countless writers have yielded to its tropical magnetism over the years—Ernest Hemingway stayed for a decade, and Tennessee Williams, Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens all spent time here. Stevens once complained that his frequent winter escape was becoming “furiously literary.” Here, we ask four locals, including one noted scribe, for their favorite aspects. The intel they share goes beyond frozen daiquiris and Papa Hemingway look-alike contests to reveal hidden beaches, hole-in-the-wall coffee shops, and three contenders for the “best” vantage point from which to watch the sun set.

Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google.<br />The company said the new service is designed for businesses and to accommodate the growing demands of hybrid work environments, where employees split their time between the office and home, said Jared Spataro, a corporate vice president at Microsoft. Instead of having to commute with their PC, workers will be able to access their personalized cloud-based Windows desktop whether they log on from the office or at home, he said.<br />“This is our take on hybrid,“ Mr. Spataro said in an interview. “Hybrid is really driving a bit of a rewiring of the operating model of our customers.”<br />Windows 365 represents the second major update to Microsoft’s iconic software franchise in as many months. The company said in June it was launching Windows 11 this year, the product’s first new version in almost six years. It seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies’ platforms.</td>

Building out broadband networks can expand productivity and connect the country virtually, much as the Interstate Highway System did decades ago. Of the roughly 10% to 15% of the funding that would go toward highways and roads, most is for repairing existing highways to reduce congestion, leading to more economic efficiency, rather than building new roads.<br />The article quotes a University of Pennsylvania economist to suggest that our framework won’t add to productivity. But a recent study by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School analyzing our broad framework found that it would result in long-term GDP growth while lifting workers’ wages and even reducing the deficit over time. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in key infrastructure priorities that will make our economy more efficient and competitive.<br />Sen.

Ms. Merkel isn’t running again at the September election after 16 years in office, a period spanning the terms of four U.S. presidents, starting with George W. Bush, that has seen a loosening of the bond between the U.S. and Europe and America’s increasing focus on Asia.<br />The drift turned to discord under President Donald Trump, who repeatedly singled out Germany in his complaints that Europe didn’t pay its way in the trans-Atlantic security arrangement, with leaders on both sides making little effort to conceal their mutual contempt.<br />In 2017, Ms. Merkel said Europe should no longer rely on others for protection and had to take its fate into its own hands, a comment aides said wasn’t just a dig at Mr. Trump’s administration but a call for more European independence amid increasing superpower competition between America and China.<br />“The tone is normal again, as is the ability to discuss all relevant issues like partners, but in terms of substance it is quite clear that America will not change some key policies,” a senior German official said. “Trump’s positions on a number of issues were American positions, only he pursued them in an aggressive way.”</td>

      <td>The jam in global supply chains is causing delays and uncertainty for businesses, in addition to higher shipping costs</td>
      <td>With transportation networks around the world overburdened, the price of shipping things from one place to another keeps going up. But when it comes to the cost pressures companies are facing, those price increases are only part of the problem.<br />The Covid-19 crisis has thrown a wrench in global supply chains. Largely stuck at home and unable to spend money on meals out, travel and other services, consumers loaded up on goods instead. Many companies didn’t see it coming and, expecting demand to fall instead, cut back on orders and production, draining their inventories. Meanwhile, the pandemic put additional constraints on shipping, as efforts to contain its spread, such as the quarantine restrictions, slowed the movement of goods.<br />The result has been an awful mess, and one that doesn’t look as if it will be resolved anytime soon. The blocking of the Suez Canal by the container ship Ever Given created a global supply traffic jam early this spring, and was followed by a Covid outbreak that cut operations at China’s busy Yantian port to 30% of normal levels.  FedEx ,  which once ran on the slogan “When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight,” suspended about 1,400 customers of its Freight shipping service in June in an effort to clear its congested network.<br />The cost to transport goods has naturally gone up, in many cases by a lot. The average price world-wide to ship a 40-foot container overseas reached $8,795.77 as of July 8, according to Drewry Shipping Consultants, which is up 333% from a year earlier. Once that container comes off the ship there are additional shipping costs, and they, too, are rising. In June, prices for transporting goods by truck were up 15% from a year earlier, according to the Labor Department, while prices at freight forwarders, customs brokers and other businesses that arrange freight and cargo for transportation were up 58%.<br />For many businesses, however, shipping delays and long lead times amount to a bigger problem than rising transportation prices.</td>

      <td>This week’s proposal for a European border tax could be a very early move toward overcoming obstacles to economists’ preferred climate-change policy</td>
      <td>A global carbon tax is viewed by many economists as the most efficient approach to decarbonizing industry, but creating one has always seemed a political impossibility. A new European Union carbon border tax just might start to change that.<br />On Wednesday, the European Commission proposed a new charge on selected imports from countries that don’t tax carbon dioxide emissions in the same way as the bloc. The levy—called a “carbon border adjustment mechanism,” or CBAM—is part of a wide-ranging package adjusting EU rules to meet new climate ambitions.<br />The measure is intended to both level the playing field between foreign and domestic producers and cut the risk that local companies relocate outside the EU to avoid the bloc’s stringent rules. As drafted, CBAM could open a path to a global carbon price by establishing a cost of carbon on some imports into the EU, one of the world’s biggest markets. Proposals need to be agreed on and will be phased in over a period of years.<br />There are plenty of political challenges, but Brussels hopes Washington will create a comparable levy to protect its domestic producers as it raises its climate ambitions. President Biden mentioned it during the 2019 presidential campaign and White House climate envoy Gina McCarthy said “it’s not off the table” at a BloombergNEF event on Tuesday.<br />A combined CBAM effort to create an EU and U.S. carbon club “could really be an incredible stimulus for others, starting with China, to do more on climate,” says Simone Tagliapietra, senior fellow at think tank Bruegel.</td>

The last time he bought soap, he had to wait in line for four hours.<br />“I was lucky. Since I didn’t buy shampoo, I was given four bars instead of the two that I’m usually allowed to buy,” said the 50-year-old Father Álvarez, who has been the parish priest in the communities that surround Cuba’s third-largest city for more than two decades.<br />Camagüey residents are used to long lines and recurring shortages of products in a country where the Communist government exercises near-total control over the economy. But the damage brought by the coronavirus pandemic has inflicted an economic disaster, slashing the flow of tourists and remittances from Cubans living abroad. About four of every 10 dollars in Cuba come from those two sources.<br />“The pandemic turned into a pressure cooker, and there was no safety valve,” said Father Álvarez. “We now have widespread shortages of food and medicine. There is no fuel or public transport. There are constant blackouts now in summer, the heat is extremely harsh and food spoils.”<br />Like hundreds of Cubans across the island, Father Álvarez was detained by police on Sunday, when thousands of protesters spontaneously took to the streets to demand food, medicine and the end of six decades of dictatorship.</td>

Here’s how:<br />General Mills Inc.,   Campbell Soup Co.  and  J.M. Smucker Co.  are just a few of the food makers raising wholesale prices, translating to higher supermarket price tags for Goldfish crackers, Folgers coffee and pet food over the summer and early fall, executives said. In restaurants, the Labor Department estimated prices increased 4.2% in June from a year earlier, with  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.,   Denny’s Corp.  and Shake Shack Inc. among the chains charging more this year.<br />Rising costs for ingredients, transport, labor and packaging are forcing companies’ hands, said General Mills Chief Executive Jeff Harmening. With consumers’ savings rates higher than ever and plentiful jobs, shoppers can bear it, he said: “No one wants to increase prices, but we’ve had to, and consumers understand.”<br />Grocery stores have also been amenable to food makers’ price increases. “We would expect to be able to pass those costs to customers,”  Kroger Co.  Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said. Worst case, he said, higher costs for major brand names will push shoppers toward Kroger’s lower-priced store brands, he said.<br />Conagra Brands Inc.  Chief Executive Sean Connolly said the company recently raised prices on its Hunt’s canned tomatoes and Chef Boyardee products given high steel prices and other costs. “It’s still a really good value relative to other options,” like restaurants, he said.</td>

      <td>Payments will go to about 39 million households</td>
      <td>The first monthly payments of the child tax credit will hit Americans’ bank accounts on July 15, beginning an experiment in family and fiscal policy. Democrats tout the monthly payments as a way to reduce child poverty and change annual lump-sum tax refunds into a more reliable stream of income. Republicans have criticized the changes for breaking the prior link between the credit and earned income.<br />The child tax credit is a federal benefit that reduces income tax liability for people with children. It was created in 1997 and since then has expanded several times. It is a credit that reduces taxes owed as opposed to a deduction that reduces taxable income. The temporary changes in effect for 2021 make it a near-universal monthly child allowance, far from the annual tax break it started as. The changes came about as part of the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus bill passed in March.<br />Here is how it works.<br />Until 2021, the credit was $2,000 per child under age 17, based on the child’s age at the end of the year. For 2021 only, Congress increased the credit to $3,000 for children ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 for children under age 6.<br />On the low end, there were limits, but they have been removed for this year. Until 2021, low-income households that didn’t owe income taxes could get as much as $1,400 of the $2,000 credit. This year, they can get the full credit even if they have no income.</td>

Brent, the international benchmark, was essentially flat at about $76.50 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate was trading around $75.10 per barrel.<br />Earlier this month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed with a Russia-led group of producers to increase production to meet soaring demand and tame climbing prices. The group early last year cut 9.7 million barrels a day of crude, the equivalent of about 10% of demand at the time.<br />Demand has suddenly accelerated as many economies, particularly in the developed world, start to hum again, after wide-scale vaccination drives and moderating new caseloads in many places. The group, called OPEC+, has previously agreed to add back about 4 million barrels a day.<br />Early this month, most delegates agreed to a deal that would call for OPEC+ to increase production by 400,000 barrels a day each month through late 2022, which would undo the remaining curbs. But over several days of talks, the U.A.E. refused to sign on.</td>

The Labor Department reported Tuesday that its consumer-price index increased 5.4% in June from a year earlier. Excluding volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 4.5% from a year earlier, the most in 30 years.<br />While the Fed and many private sector forecasters had expected inflation to rise this year as a surge in consumer spending collided with pandemic-related shortages and bottlenecks, the strength of the last three monthly inflation readings has been greater than many anticipated. While inflation is expected to decline, questions abound over how soon and how low inflation will fall relative to the Fed’s 2% target.</td>

      <td>As Winston Churchill might have quipped, sustainable fuels are the worst way of greening the aviation industry, except for all other ways.<br />On Wednesday,  Boeing  said it is investing in scaling up the production of such fuels through a partnership with SkyNRG. The Dutch firm is launching North American operations, having already struck a deal with Alaska Airlines.<br />Since electric planes—such as the 19-seat aircraft that United Airlines and Mesa are investing in—will only fly very short ranges, the onus is on Boeing and  Airbus  to make their replacements for the 737 and A320 families more sustainable. Whereas Airbus has unveiled plans for hydrogen-powered aircraft to perhaps enter service by 2035, Boeing has suggested this is unlikely before 2050.<br />Of course, both are researching all options. But the Chicago-based company is quite publicly placing most of its green chips on sustainable fuels. Back in January, it established a goal to build planes that run 100% on them by 2030, rather than the maximum 50% blend currently allowed.<br />“Drop-in” fuels require very few changes in aircraft design and infrastructure. Their big disadvantage is paltry production capacity: Less than 1% of aviation fuels are sustainable, and they will only make up 20% of demand by 2040, the International Energy Agency thinks.</td>

If the negotiations are successful, they would result in the first multilateral trade agreement for the 164-member group since 2013. Many say it would be the most significant pact since the WTO was established in 1995.<br />Member nations have been squabbling for years over how to stop overfishing. Ms. Okonjo-Iweala, who took office in March, is pressing them to compromise, and business and environmental groups are optimistic her approach will lead to a resolution.<br />“There is not going to be a better moment to deliver on this mandate,“ says Isabel Jarrett, a fisheries expert at Pew Charitable Trusts. “This is important to Dr. Ngozi to show that in her first year, she can deliver an outcome of global importance.”<br />Global annual fish consumption is expected to grow 16.3% between 2020 and 2029, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, pressuring wild fish populations.</td>

Many Muslim families say authorities are broadening their interpretation of laïcité—applying it to everything from what’s served in the cafeteria to whether Muslim mothers can chaperone field trips wearing head scarves—in ways that target Muslims for their religious beliefs.<br />Teachers, administrators and French officials say they are pushing back against a decadeslong cultural shift, in which schools have come under pressure to accommodate the religious beliefs of many French Muslims in ways big and small. The pressure, they say, is undercutting a republic built on the principle of laïcité as well as the values of equality, liberty and fraternity.</td>

      <td>Advertising could be the holy grail, and the online grocery giant’s CEO might hold the keys</td>
      <td>Your food-delivery apps could soon look a lot like your social-media feeds. You can thank Instacart for that.<br />The online grocery giant announced last week that Fidji Simo, the former head of  Facebook ’s  legacy Blue app, will succeed Instacart’s founder Apoorva Mehta as its new chief executive officer, effective next month. She will likely bring changes to Instacart that could have lasting influence across the food-delivery industry.<br />Instacart and restaurant-delivery platforms might seem like similar businesses on the surface, using gig-economy workers to deliver food to consumers. But there are key differences worth noting. While Instacart says the majority of its shoppers are independent contractors, the company also employs full-service shoppers in some stores on a part-time basis. In part because of their larger average basket sizes, groceries as a core business relative to restaurant food also make for very different unit economics. Instacart last year said it did $1.5 billion of revenue but handled “tens of billions” of dollars in gross transaction value. While not a perfect comparison,  DoorDash  generated almost twice the revenue last year, handling roughly $25 billion in gross order value for its largest business.<br />But that dynamic could change. Alongside its grocery-delivery business, Instacart is growing an advertising business, which it believes can one day be on par with some of the largest digital-advertising businesses in the world. The hiring as CEO of Ms. Simo, who led the launch of ads on Facebook’s News Feed and the team in charge of monetizing mobile ads for the platform, points to Instacart’s ambitions to accelerate this business. Over the last two years, Instacart has made three high-profile hires from  Amazon  and Google to lead and manage its advertising business.<br />Data from both Edison Trends and Bloomberg Second Measure show that Instacart’s market share in grocery pickup and delivery spiked early on in the pandemic. That market share remains elevated from pre-pandemic levels but has come down since then. In April, Instacart had a commanding market-share lead on U.S. consumer sales among select U.S. grocery pickup and delivery companies, according to Bloomberg Second Measure, taking significant share from  Walmart .  But as of May, Walmart was on top once again.</td>

The restrictions mean, for example, that customers can’t use Tencent’s payment system to buy goods on an Alibaba platform.<br />Now, both companies are separately working on plans to loosen those curbs, according to people familiar with the matter. The system could make life more convenient for consumers—and help spur greater competition—but will also mean the duo will have more insight into each other’s businesses.<br />Initial steps from Alibaba could include introducing Tencent’s WeChat Pay to Alibaba’s e-commerce marketplaces, Taobao and Tmall, some of the people said.<br />Tencent could make it easier to share Alibaba e-commerce listings on its WeChat messaging app, or allow selected Alibaba services to access WeChat users via so-called mini-programs, some of the people said. Mini-programs are light apps embedded in the main WeChat app.</td>

Many of them also set dates in late July by which unvaccinated people would be barred from entering schools, libraries, prisons, nursing homes and inpatient facilities at hospitals without a valid medical exemption.<br />Some of the localities attributed their new policies to “national, provincial and municipal arrangements,” without explaining whether they received a decree from the central government.<br />China is dealing with sporadic outbreaks of Covid-19 and authorities have been offering homegrown vaccines free of charge since last December.<br />The government notices have sparked online pushback from some Chinese and triggered a debate—as in the U.S. and elsewhere—about whether people should be required to present proof of inoculation to travel, work or undertake other routine activities outside their home.</td>

      <td>New rules target what the White House says is a pattern of consolidation</td>
      <td>President Biden’s sweeping executive order signed last week laid out the administration’s priorities for promoting competitive markets and limiting corporate dominance. Among the dozens of provisions included in the order are directives aimed at railroads and ocean shipping.<br />The administration says the relatively small number of major players in the ocean-shipping trade and the U.S. freight-rail business has enabled companies to charge unreasonable fees. In the case of the seven Class 1 freight railroads, consolidation has given some railroad companies control of most of the freight tracks in parts of the country.<br />The executive order encourages the Surface Transportation Board to take up a longstanding proposed rule mandating so-called reciprocal or competitive switching, the practice whereby shippers served by a single railroad can request bids from a nearby competing railroad if service is available. The competitor railroad would pay access fees to the monopoly railroad, but could win the shipper’s business by offering a lower price, using the rival railroad’s tracks and property. The railroad trade association, the Association of American Railroads, has opposed the policy.<br />In its actions targeting the transportation sector, the administration is highlighting what it calls the dangers of consolidation. For U.S. importers, the consolidation has given ocean carriers leverage to raise fees such as those for demurrage, essentially late fees on shipments that aren’t picked up from freight terminals on time.<br />The executive order asks the maritime commission to take steps to protect American exporters from high fees. The order also asks the commission to work with the Justice Department to enforce its actions.</td>

      <td>A flood of investment into clean tech propelled onetime startups such as  Tesla Inc.  into the stratosphere. For most young companies in the sector, the past decade was a fight to raise the funds needed for takeoff.<br />That is changing amid a boom in green investing. The new wave of cash is helping startups get from laboratory to market.<br />Dubbed the valley of death, the gap between the invention of a potentially breakthrough technology and large-scale commercial production has wiped out many startups. Big investors have long been wary of businesses like solar farms and battery makers that require big capital spending long before profitability.<br />“It’s one thing to develop something really interesting, really cool in the lab,” Michael Edelman, chief executive of Massachusetts battery-technology company Ionic Materials, at a recent conference for the Energy Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy program, known as ARPA-E. “But how do you get it to a point where you can manufacture it cost effectively at the right quality consistently so your customers will buy it?”<br />The clean-energy industry’s fundraising dilemma goes back a decade to the 2011 failure of California solar firm Solyndra, which had received government backing, and the 2012 bankruptcy of battery maker A123 Systems Inc., once seen as a company that would help revolutionize the auto industry. In the years before that, funds flowed into the sector, creating some of today’s leaders, like Tesla, but also many losers. After the failure, government funding dried up, and private financing stagnated.</td>

      <td>A new paper by a pair of economists says the gains from infrastructure spending aren’t always clear-cut and recommends that policy makers examine the costs and benefits of each project.<br />“If we are going to commit a significant amount of resources to new infrastructure projects or to maintain our existing infrastructure, bringing some discipline to the way we decide what we’re spending on is an important element of this,” said James Poterba, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who co-wrote the paper with Edward Glaeser of Harvard University.<br />The paper is set for publication Wednesday by the Aspen Economic Strategy Group, a division of the nonpartisan Aspen Institute. Mr. Poterba is a member of the group. Congress and the White House are now working on a bill that would include about $579 billion in new infrastructure spending.<br />The common way to determine the country’s infrastructure needs is to calculate how much it would cost to relieve congestion and to improve the roads, bridges, airports and transit systems that already exist. The economists’ approach instead looks at projects individually to assess whether they are needed.<br />In some cases, the authors write, the best solution doesn’t involve construction at all. Rather than building new lanes to ease traffic in a dense urban area, it might make sense to consider congestion pricing, which charges drivers a variable fee depending on time of day, they write.</td>

China is the world’s largest carbon emitter.<br />The program will initially involve 2,225 companies in the power sector. Those companies are responsible for a seventh of global carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion, according to calculations by the International Energy Agency.<br />Under the trading program, emitters such as power plants and factories are given a fixed amount of carbon they are allowed to release a year. They can in turn buy or sell those allowances. That pushes emitters to think of controlling and reducing emissions in terms of a market.<br />Bloomberg earlier reported that the carbon market would start trading on Friday.</td>

It would limit pollution across the European economy, including electricity generation, automobiles, housing, shipping and agriculture.<br />The plan also aims to project the bloc’s stance on slashing emissions abroad by imposing the world’s first tax on imports based on the greenhouse gases emitted to make them. The move is contentious as countries prepare to convene at a climate summit in November in Glasgow, Scotland, where the U.S. and Europe want to convince China and poorer countries to make ambitious new pledges to cut emissions.<br />China plans this week to launch its own national emissions-trading system.<br />The commission’s proposal has strong backing in European capitals, but its details will be fiercely debated in coming months by EU governments and the European Parliament, which must approve the plan before it can become law. Negotiators must bridge differences across the EU from wealthier countries like France—which has relatively low emissions because of its reliance on nuclear power—to poorer Eastern European nations such as Poland, a major user of coal-fired electricity.</td>

Republicans have also raised concerns that the revenue measures, which also include public-private partnerships, may not ultimately cover the cost of the plan.<br />Those two issues could peel off Republican members of the group, which is set to meet Tuesday evening to work through the remaining questions, lawmakers said. In the 50-50 Senate, at least 10 Republicans would need to join every Democrat in support of the infrastructure agreement for it to pass.<br />“Where we’re really going to have challenges when we meet is on the payfors.

The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Athlete-Students<br />The “student-athlete” was always more of an ideal than a reality. In my time in collegiate tennis at the University of Tennessee, it was a common saying that the name should be changed to “athlete-student.” We all knew where priorities truly lay. Any current or former student-athlete could quickly tell you how compliance with NCAA limits on practice and training hours is rare, while enforcement of restrictions on benefits is utterly disproportionate. But it’s not only the NCAA and athletic departments; many student-athletes view their collegiate sports experience as a necessary stepping-stone to a professional career, with academics as an afterthought or even an obstacle.<br />Many schools and athletic programs, especially the non-revenue-generating ones, continue to respect the student-athlete ideal as something at which to aim. The upper echelons of collegiate sports, however, have long stopped trying, and the trend toward some form of compensation there will help align the rules with the reality. The student-athlete will continue to exist elsewhere, in some form, but don’t kid yourself into thinking the ideal can ever coexist with record-breaking TV-rights deals.</td>

      <td>His escalating rhetoric is meant to justify the unjustifiable, H.R.1.</td>
      <td>The Democratic narrative on voting is becoming unglued. “The 21st-century Jim Crow assault is real,” President Biden claimed Tuesday. “We’re facing the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War—that’s not hyperbole,” he said in the same speech. “The Confederates back then never breached the Capitol, as insurrectionists did on January the 6th.”<br />As Mr. Biden apparently sees it, the latest Civil War is in Texas, where state lawmakers want to make voting “so hard and inconvenient that they hope people don’t vote at all.” On Monday more than 50 Democrats from the Texas House absconded to Washington, D.C., to deny their chamber a quorum. “I left because I am tired of sitting as a hostage,” one lawmaker told the awaiting press at Dulles airport, “while Republicans strip away the rights of my constituents to vote.”<br />This partisan rhetoric is detached from the facts. We’ve already gone through the misrepresentations of Georgia’s and Florida’s voting laws. What’s proposed in Texas? First, the bills would end two practices that Harris County pioneered last year amid the pandemic: drive-through voting and 24-hour voting. These options were used disproportionately by nonwhites. Perhaps they made sense when every Texan was urged to stay six feet from every other Texan.<br />But if the Legislature doesn’t want them to be permanent, then reverting to the pre-Covid status quo of 2019 is not some epochal loss for voting rights. Gov. Greg Abbott argues that drive-through voting breaks the traditional privacy of the polling booth. “Are you going to have people in the car with you?” he asked. “It could be somebody from your employer or somebody else who may have some coercive effect on the way that you would cast your ballot.”<br />As for 24-hour voting, it isn’t unreasonable to think polling-place mischief might be more likely at 3 a.m. Public confidence can be undermined by even false claims about what happened in the dead of night, including President Trump’s wild allegations about ballot “dumps.” The Texas bills would allow broad voting hours: 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. in the Senate version, or 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. in the House version.</td>

Used car and truck prices rose 10.5% in the month, accounting for about half the increase in core CPI. No doubt vehicle prices won’t keep rising at that rate, but then that’s also what we were told when they rose 10% in April. This won’t reassure the non-affluent Americans who buy used cars.<br />Price increases were widespread across the economy, which suggests factors that may not be transitory. Food prices rose 0.8%, and energy prices 1.5% in the month. The Fed likes to strip out food and energy prices, which are volatile, to examine core inflation. But the core increase was also 0.9% in June.<br />Year-over-year core prices are up 4.5%, which is less than for all consumer prices, but is still well above the Fed’s target of 2% a year. The last time core prices rose 4.5% in a 12-month period was 1991 and the Fed’s benchmark short-term interest rate was above 5%. Today it’s near zero.<br />These price jolts aren’t likely to stir Fed Chairman Jerome Powell when he testifies on Capitol Hill this week. That’s because Mr. Powell is getting the inflation he wanted. The Fed’s new policy, which it unveiled last year, says that to achieve its 2% inflation target it is willing to tolerate inflation above that for some time. Congratulations, you’ve got it.</td>

      <td>The regime has rounded up the usual democratic suspects and more.</td>
      <td>As the world’s attention moves away from Cuba and its Sunday protests, we shouldn’t forget the brave individuals being rounded up and brutalized by the government of Miguel Díaz-Canel.<br />His crackdown has been vicious. Cuban police in riot gear, military troops and paramilitary groups have been unleashed on civilians and the press trying to chronicle events. Thanks to cell-phone technology, much of this ugly stuff is available for the world to witness.<br />Multiple images have captured state security wrestling demonstrators into custody or knocking them down and pummeling them on the ground. One video shows plain-clothes agents chasing a young Cuban to the roof of a building, where they beat him with batons until he collapses. Another video shows police firing on civilians in Havana.<br />Associated Press photographer Ramon Espinosa’s face was bloodied by police while covering the protests. According to AP, a mob of pro-regime activists also “assaulted an AP cameraman, disabling his camera.”<br />Cuban dissidents Guillermo Fariñas, former political prisoner José Daniel Ferrer and artist Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara have been arrested, along with at least 190 others. The whereabouts of some aren’t known.</td>

      <td>The split bill is good for him. It complicates life and minimizes losses for congressional Democrats.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s insistence on splitting his infrastructure package into two bills—one bipartisan, the second to be passed along party lines—is good for him but will make life complicated for congressional Democrats. Mr. Biden can get credit for trying to enact his party’s most extreme positions, while not paying the price for succeeding politically as Barack Obama did in 2010.<br />Conservatives shouldn’t rejoice about the policy implications. By using executive action, Mr. Biden will go further left than any predecessor, but not as far as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders demand. But when it comes to legislation, the partisan “budget reconciliation” process will force Senate Democrats to blame each other, not Mr. Biden or irrelevant Republicans. Moderates like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema will save the president from his party’s excesses and absorb progressive ire for his failure to deliver.<br />Mr. Biden will happily defend civility, bipartisanship, “pay fors” and other process arguments unlikely to excite anyone outside Washington, rather than referee internal Democratic policy fights. His insistence on passing the first infrastructure bill with 10 Republican votes to overcome the Senate filibuster keeps more-radical policies out of the bill and focuses spending on hard infrastructure like roads and ports, which is popular with voters. Mr. Biden will still get enough green spending to appease center-left voters, but he’ll employ a rope-a-dope strategy with Mr. Sanders’s followers, allowing them to expend their energy pushing congressional Democrats while he offers mild and vague encouragement.<br />The stakes are high for 2022 because the margins are so narrow. Speaker Nancy Pelosi can lose only four seats and maintain her majority, yet seven House Democrats represent districts Donald Trump won. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s margin is a single senator.<br />Republicans have faced narrow majorities and internal divisions before. Tea-party activists were often less angry at Democrats for passing ObamaCare than at Speaker John Boehner and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell for failing to get rid of it; they grudgingly respected Democrats for using whatever means necessary to accomplish their liberal goals. Sen. Ted Cruz became a hero to many by encouraging the House to use the appropriations process to defund ObamaCare, a fight that angered leadership and led to a government shutdown. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives will be similarly motivated to fight with their fellow Democrats.</td>

      <td>A diplomatic push for fair elections in December would serve U.S. interests.</td>
      <td>President Obama’s biggest regret, he told “Fox News Sunday” in 2016, was “failing to plan for the day after” the 2011 intervention in Libya, which toppled dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Joe Biden has a chance to make amends.<br />Largely forgotten by the U.S. and its allies, Libya has become a center of human trafficking and the source of a migrant crisis in Europe. It has suffered from a decade of civil strife and fractured leadership. Its oil reserves, Africa’s richest, are at risk of coming under Turkish and Russian control. The solution: free and fair elections and the removal of all foreign forces.<br />Libya effectively has two governments. Russia supports the eastern one, led by the Libyan National Army, the country’s only unified force, under the command of Gen. Khalifa Haftar. In the west, militias, some Islamist in character, fight among themselves when they aren’t fighting Gen. Haftar.<br />Turkey’s military, seeking to ensure access to the Mediterranean Sea for energy exploration, backs the western Islamist militias. In April, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Ankara and Libya’s western Government of National Accord were committed to a 2019 maritime demarcation in the eastern Mediterranean. The agreement directly threatens a January 2020 energy deal between Israel and Greece. The latter doesn’t want Mr. Erdogan to have further influence around its shores. An uneasy cease-fire has held in Libya since October, but both Turkey and Russia are reinforcing by building air and naval bases.<br />The U.S. has largely stayed out of Libyan affairs since the 2012 Benghazi debacle. But Washington can take responsibility by insisting on free and fair elections. “We’d like the U.S. to remove all foreign forces in Libya, and we hope the U.S. will pressure all groups in Libya to make sure the elections in December will take place,” says Abdulhadi Soliman, spokesman for the Fezzan Libya Organization, a nonprofit based in the southwestern part of the country.</td>
