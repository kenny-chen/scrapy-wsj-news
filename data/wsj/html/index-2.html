      <td>During a tumultuous year, sneaker companies continued to deliver an incredible number of sneaker designs, some with truly perplexing features--evoking cloven hoofs, teeter-totters and even melting ice-cream cones</td>
      <td>AROUND THIS TIME last year, I cataloged the strangest clothing items I’d come across in 2019: seven superlatively odd garments that stood out from the many, many pieces of fashion I’d encountered over the previous 365 days. (I’m still wondering who would buy Moschino’s bobble-head baseball caps.)<br />2020 has been another beast altogether. For the past nine months or so, I’ve been working from my kitchen table. Meanwhile, many of the trappings of the fashion industry are gone. Runway shows are rare now; on hold are the sort of in-person meetings I’d previously attended to review new collections; and red-carpet events—with their outlandish celebrity outfits—have largely disappeared. In short, I’ve had far fewer opportunities to inspect new clothes, bizarre or otherwise.<br />One facet of the industry felt like business as usual, however: the ceaseless churn of sneaker releases. For years, shoe brands have been hyping their shoes on Instagram and selling them through webshops or phone apps—a digital rollout system that seemed already designed for a socially distanced America. And so all year long, as we all shopped from home, brands like Prada,  Nike  and Vans rolled out an incredible number of new sneakers.<br />Many of these sneakers are immensely odd, marked by design elements like fake fur, colors more lurid than a bowl of Lucky Charms and convoluted soles that would look at home in Robo-Cop’s wardrobe. Many of these garish shoes have nevertheless become collectible, fetching thousands of dollars (or at least ten times their sticker price) on the resale market.<br />2020’s crop of sneakers further supported my theory that sneaker designs are getting stranger and stranger as a way to stand out on little phone screens. The sneakers that I remember from this year are those that made me stop my mindless scrolling and think, ‘What is going on?’ Here are seven contenders for weirdest of them all.</td>

      <td>TOKYO—Like many foreigners in Japan, David Atkinson has a few ideas about how the place could be run better.<br />But the former Goldman Sachs analyst is the only one with the ear of the prime minister and a policy voice so powerful that some Japanese business leaders are getting riled.<br />The 55-year-old Englishman is the lone foreigner among eight business experts on the government’s economic strategy council. He is the author of 12 Japanese-language books and divides his time between running a business that renovates temples and shrines and offering policy advice at meetings in which he reels off statistics.<br />Mr. Atkinson has lived in Japan since 1990, a few years after he graduated from Oxford University, and speaks Japanese fluently. At Goldman in the 1990s, he presciently warned that Japanese banks’ weaknesses were endangering the economy. More recently he has been known as a strong advocate for boosting tourism.<br />His latest message is that fixing Japan’s economic stagnation begins with raising the productivity of its smaller companies. This month, the government said it planned to offer up to about $1 million to small or midsize companies that merge or expand into new business areas—a direct result of Mr. Atkinson’s advocacy.</td>

      <td>Credits tied to carbon emissions are having a banner year despite a record drop in output from the power plants and steel mills that need them to operate.<br />The price of carbon credits, used by governments in Europe to curb greenhouse gases and traded by hedge funds and other investors, has risen 30% this year, putting it on a par with gold as one of the best performing commodity-linked assets.  Intercontinental Exchange  carbon futures traded Thursday for €32.03 a ton, equivalent to $39.14, just below their record highs hit earlier this month.<br />Driving the latest rally is the recent decision by the European Union to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 55% of 1990 levels by 2030. Traders are also expecting regulations on the burning of fossil fuels will be tightened to meet the new target, including reducing the number of carbon credits available.<br />“It’s the pricing in of increased future ambition,” said Ariel Perez, senior carbon trader at commodities trading company Hartree Partners. “All that explicitly reduces supply and lower supply should lead to higher prices.”<br />Morgan Stanley  upped its 2025 forecast for European carbon-credit prices in September to €76 from €44, meaning the bank expects current prices to more than double by the middle of the decade. The EU’s climate agenda has significant implications for the price of carbon credits, the bank said.</td>

The political and media condemnation was swift and scathing. Douglas shut its stores the next day and issued an apology.<br />“Our decision to keep some stores with drugstore products open was incomprehensible to many people,” Ms. Müller wrote on her  Twitter  feed. “All of our German stores will remain closed from today until further notice. We apologize to those who feel offended by our actions.”<br />The short-lived experiment was just one of the most high-profile examples of how businesses, from large corporations to mom-and-pop diners and even brothels, have been scanning lockdown orders for loopholes to maintain some activity.</td>

      <td>Smaller businesses have offered investment opportunities triggered by disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and Brendon Parry, who oversees TIFF Investment Management’s private markets program, doesn’t expect that to change once it has been contained.<br />Started by executives at nonprofit groups as The Investment Fund for Foundations in 1991, Radnor, Pa.-based TIFF now manages about $7 billion in assets for 501(c) 3 organizations. Mr. Parry recently spoke with WSJ Pro Private Equity’s Preeti Singh regarding the lower midmarket sector and its opportunities for investments and co-investments, even after the pandemic eases. Some of his comments have been edited for clarity.<br />WSJ: Amid the pandemic, are there still attractive investment opportunities in the lower midmarket?<br />MR. PARRY: There is a massive investment opportunity set in the lower midmarket and the potential to create value and capture multiple expansion in these companies, if the general partner can professionalize and grow the business. But there are also a lot of bad companies and general partners operating in the lower midmarket, and we expect to see a shake out on the other side of the pandemic.<br />We’re long-term investors in this part of the market and understand it well. A lot of managers treat the lower midmarket as a sort of training ground. They raise a small fund, build a track record and move upmarket as fast as they can so that they can generate more fees with larger assets under management and the potential for more carry dollars.</td>

Even more rare are cases against smaller retailers and businesses, which the U.S. Chamber of Commerce had said were particularly vulnerable to financially crippling claims.<br />Existing laws have funneled most employee claims against employers into workers’ compensation systems, which don’t typically award the large sums sought by trial attorneys who can sue for pain and suffering in the courts.<br />Commercial litigators had braced their clients for a wave of negligence litigation. Back in April, the Chamber of Commerce warned its membership in April that Covid liability suits are “perhaps the largest area of concern for the overall business community.”<br />“In the beginning, we were concerned for our clients that this was going to spur a lot of personal-injury lawsuits,” said William Hubbard, a partner in the Cleveland law firm Thompson Hine which represents businesses. “The facts might just not be there for the cases.”</td>

      <td>New program encourages shoppers to insist on receipts, which become lottery tickets</td>
      <td><br />ROME—Italy is rolling the dice on a new attempt to stamp out tax evasion: a lottery in which only people who ask for receipts can take part.<br />Beginning Jan. 1, shoppers will receive a virtual ticket for each euro they spend in any store, so long as they ask for a receipt. Seven people will win 5,000 euros, equivalent to about $6,100, each week, with a top prize of €5 million at the end of next year.<br />The idea is to use the allure of cash prizes to ensure transactions are recorded and a levy is paid on them in a bid to reduce the tax dodging that has weighed on Italy’s economy for decades. The lottery complements another program in which shoppers can get cash back of up to 10% of whatever they spend until the end of the year, up to a total of €150, if they use their card.<br />Italy isn’t the first country to try the approach. Governments in several countries have turned receipts into lottery tickets to persuade shoppers to demand that their purchases go on the books, including China, some states in Brazil, the Czech Republic and Portugal. Some have found it an effective way to increase tax revenue without increasing rates.</td>

The department could also be drawn into politically sensitive actions by the president, such as grants of clemency to family members and allies, though Mr. Trump has largely ignored the department on its pardon recommendations and could leave it as a bystander to such moves.<br />The Justice Department is also still overseeing a number of closely watched investigations that have drawn the personal attention of the president—including a criminal tax probe into President-elect Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden and a continuing review by special counsel John Durham into actions taken by federal investigators during the 2016 election campaign.<br />The remaining few weeks of Mr. Trump’s term are likely to be dominated by these and other matters, potentially putting Mr. Rosen at the center of numerous brewing political battles with the White House. Though Mr. Barr was long a stalwart defender of Mr. Trump’s agenda and priorities as head of the Justice Department, he rebuffed the president’s calls to appoint a special counsel to investigate election fraud and the allegations against the younger Mr. Biden, and attempted to insulate criminal probes under way from political pressure.<br />The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.</td>

      <td>Government’s antitrust broadside against Chinese tech giant marks an escalation in hostilities</td>
      <td>The billionaire founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is unlikely to have a merry Christmas this year.<br />Jack Ma was dealt a double blow on Christmas Eve: The Chinese antitrust watchdog launched an investigation into Alibaba, while Ant Group, the company’s finance affiliate, was summoned to discuss competition and consumer rights.<br />Specifically, the regulators mentioned the practice of forcing merchants to sell exclusively on Alibaba’s platforms. This is a longstanding issue in China’s e-commerce industry, where Alibaba reigns supreme.  JD.com ,  Alibaba’s competitor, has complained about it for years and filed lawsuits against the market leader. Abuse of digital-platform power is also a theme of antitrust suits in the U.S. and Europe against the likes of  Amazon  and Google.<br />It isn’t the first time the government has tried to step in. The antitrust regulator summoned 20 e-commerce platforms in November last year to urge them to stop monopolistic practices. But recent events have reinforced the impression that Beijing means business.<br />The government announced draft antitrust rules against digital platforms last month, after Ant Group’s $34 billion initial public offering was abruptly stopped by the regulators. The move seemed to be endorsed by the very top of China’s leadership structure. President Xi pledged to step up antimonopoly efforts to “prevent the disorderly expansion of capital” in a meeting earlier this month. Since then, the regulators have fined Alibaba and Tencent for acquisitions that were completed years earlier. Just this week, the government warned the internet giants about predatory pricing in what is known as community-group buying, a popular way to sell groceries online.</td>

Only farmers who provided species like firs and spruces to Christmas tree lots were greenlighted for relief, leaving some feeling like they would be Grinched this Yuletide after an already brutal year.<br />“You see all these other businesses getting all this help from the government, and it’s frustrating,” said Thomas Douglass, a fifth-generation logger in Maine, who said his family business was “one big equipment breakdown from a disaster.”<br />Now, tucked inside the new $900 billion coronavirus relief package passed by Congress, but facing an uncertain fate with President Trump, is $200 million in aid for the loggers and the trucking companies that transport their wares to paper mills and other processing facilities.

There have been more than 38 million transfers this year of less than $1,000 of bitcoin into personal wallets, according to Chainalysis. That is nearly double the 20 million in 2017.</td>

As kidnapping carries a maximum of seven years in jail, and Mr. Sheikh had already been locked up for 18 years at that point, he was eligible for release.<br />Three accomplices who were sentenced to life in prison at the same 2002 trial had their convictions completely overturned in the April ruling.<br />However, Mr. Sheikh and the three others remained in prison after Pakistani authorities used emergency detention powers.</td>

      <td>President Trump issued 26 more pardons on Wednesday, granting clemency to individuals including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, longtime adviser Roger Stone and Charles Kushner, his son-in-law’s father.<br />Mr. Trump, who used the clemency power only sparingly early in his term, appears to be freely exercising it in his final weeks in office to grant reprieves to allies and associates in his political orbit. In addition to the acts of clemency announced this week, last month he pardoned his former national-security adviser Mike Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<br />Messrs. Stone and Manafort played instrumental roles in the president’s political rise, with Mr. Manafort serving as his campaign chairman in 2016 and Mr. Stone acting as a longtime political confidant. Both men were charged as part of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The elder Mr. Kushner served more than two years in prison.<br />An analysis by Harvard Law professor and former Justice Department official Jack Goldsmith found that 60 of the 65 pardons Mr. Trump granted before Wednesday went to individuals with personal or political connections to the president. Mr. Trump has bypassed the normal Justice Department process for reviewing pardons, frequently hearing appeals for clemency directly from celebrities or other friends, business associates or political allies.<br />Mr. Trump has also granted pardons to former law-enforcement officials accused of wrongdoing, as well as numerous political figures accused of crime, including campaign-finance violations. On Tuesday, he pardoned 15 others, among them three former Republican congressmen and several former military contractors convicted of wartime killing of Iraqi civilians.</td>

      <td>Personal gift-giving, as opposed to communal merry-making, is a recent development, but the logic of charity at Christmas is perennial.</td>
      <td>If, on Christmas morning, you discover that Santa surprised you with a copy of “The Oxford Handbook of Christmas,” what might you expect? Something like “The Boy Scout Handbook,” a compendium of useful information about preserving eggnog or tying bows rather than knots? Or perhaps a religious handbook for the season that includes daily prayers and spiritual exercises?<br />Fortunately, since such books would, by Christmas Day, be pointless for the next 11 months, this vast collection, edited by Timothy Larsen—an expert in Victorian religious life—offers stimulating essays on what might be called Christmasness; thus it will be ever timely. Roughly four-dozen writers (mostly scholars and theologians) take up the history, theology, worship, global traditions and artistic creations surrounding Christmas.<br />Much of what is on offer conjures Thomas Cranmer’s encouragement in the Book of Common Prayer to “read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest.” Consider one simple element in the nativity scene from the Gospel of Luke (aka Linus’s big speech in “A Charlie Brown Christmas”): the swaddling clothes. Here they are unwrapped to reveal layers of meaning. Some are literal: Greeks, Romans and Jews, we learn, swaddled their young—wrapped their babies tightly in strips of cloth—but not the Spartans. Other meanings are scriptural: In Job, God enwraps the sea, “thick darkness its swaddling band.” Luke’s phrase can also be seen as a comment on pagan myth: Rhea swaddles a stone to trick the infanticidal Kronos into swallowing it rather than their child Zeus. Then there are the meanings that refer to salvation: Jesus’ swaddling clothes prefigure his freeing us from death’s winding sheets.<br />Luke may be specific about the infant Christ’s wrappings, but, as the opening to the handbook’s New Testament section notes: “Scripture supplies no stable, donkey, three kings, or numerous other props of seasonal children’s pageants.” The Gospel of Matthew reveals the place of Jesus’ birth and Luke allows us to calculate the year, but the exact date is unknowable. By about A.D. 200, there were at least four estimates, ranging from January to May—but nothing in December. How did Christmas land on Dec. 25? The theologian Paul F. Bradshaw is as artfully forensic as Hercule Poirot, eliminating the usual suspects, such as the dates inherited from pagan holidays. “The weakness” of one theory, he dryly remarks, was that its author “was unable to produce any firm evidence in support of it.” He leans toward the scholars who explain Dec. 25 by showing long-ago attempts to date Christ’s conception to late March.<br />Dorothy Sayers once said that Christmas had become “barnacled about with sentimental accretions.” She worried that banalities would dull the shock of the Incarnation. For the scholars in “The Oxford Handbook of Christmas,” all the accreted layers are interesting. Take gifts, for instance. The first Christmas present was, of course, Jesus himself: “For God so loved the world, that he gave His only begotten Son.” But personal gift-giving (as opposed to communal merry-making) is a recent development, coinciding with industrialization (more stuff to buy) but not limited to it: The 5-year-old Laura Ingalls received both store-bought peppermint candy and homemade red mittens. Louisa May Alcott’s “Little Women” begins during the Civil War with unhappy teens: “Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents!” But then they bring their Christmas dinner to a poor German immigrant family, an act of kindness that inspires the rich man next door to send Christmas treats to them in turn. Charitable traditions at Christmas now encompass people of all faiths and none.</td>

Everywhere there was stability, in government and in society, for the centurions saw that it was so.<br />But everywhere there was something else, too. There was oppression—for those who were not the friends of Tiberius Caesar. There was the tax gatherer to take the grain from the fields and the flax from the spindle to feed the legions or to fill the hungry treasury from which divine Caesar gave largess to the people. There was the impressor to find recruits for the circuses. There were executioners to quiet those whom the Emperor proscribed. What was a man for but to serve Caesar?<br />There was the persecution of men who dared think differently, who heard strange voices or read strange manuscripts. There was enslavement of men whose tribes came not from Rome, disdain for those who did not have the familiar visage. And most of all, there was everywhere a contempt for human life.

      <td>His vetoes could cost Republicans the two Jan. 5 Georgia runoffs.</td>
      <td>President Trump is leaving office as he entered, with a whirlwind of action that gets more attention than it accomplishes. He may also take down his party’s chances of winning the Senate runoffs on Jan. 5. Does he care?<br />On Wednesday Mr. Trump vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that passed the House and Senate with overwhelming votes. He said the bill doesn’t include the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that provides liability protection for online platforms.<br />“Section 230 facilitates the spread of foreign disinformation online, which is a serious threat to our national security and election integrity. It must be repealed,” Mr. Trump said in a veto statement. The bigger threat to security is the recent Russian hack of the U.S. government, not social media companies.<br />Mr. Trump’s real objection is that  Twitter  and other tech giants are progressive outfits that block or restrict conservative content. On that he is often right, and Section 230 shouldn’t be immune from scrutiny. But repealing it wholesale, without debate, in a year-end defense bill is self-destructive. The only sure beneficiary would be the plaintiffs bar. Twitter and other tech platforms might become more censorious, not less, and conservatives aren’t likely to be favored in that scrum.<br />The NDAA isn’t perfect, but it extends hazard pay for U.S. forces that is set to expire at the end of the year. Mr. Trump’s statement called the bill a “gift” to China and Russia. But we doubt China will see it that way, since it establishes a Pacific Deterrence Initiative that authorizes $2.2 billion for, among other things, putting more military assets in China’s backyard and conducting exercises with allies. The bill also includes an overhaul of the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent, as well as cybersecurity provisions to protect command and control of U.S. nuclear systems.</td>

      <td>A top journal retracts a study following a political outcry.</td>
      <td>In 2020 scientific publications have leapt into the political fray. Scientific American gave its first ever Presidential endorsement to Joe Biden, declaring that Donald Trump “rejects evidence and science.” The New England Journal of Medicine said in a pre-election editorial that “our current leaders have undercut trust in science.”<br />But if populist politicians undercut trust in science, sometimes they are aided by science’s own institutions. Consider the controversy over a now-retracted paper in the prestigious science journal Nature Communications, which shows how political fashions can dictate what research outcomes are acceptable.<br />In November three NYU Abu Dhabi researchers came under fire for an article questioning the popular academic view that young women scientists are better off with female mentors. Their “science of science” study analyzed the impact of millions of scientific papers with junior and senior authors and drew conclusions about the effect of mentorship on careers.<br />“While current diversity policies encourage same-gender mentorships to retain women in academia,” the paper says in the abstract, “our findings raise the possibility that opposite-gender mentorship may actually increase the impact of women who pursue a scientific career.”<br />The authors—two of whom are women—pointed to possible explanations for their findings, including that “historically, male scientists had enjoyed more privileges and access to resources than their female counterparts.”</td>

      <td>Congress approved the Sudan Claims Resolution Act this week, and our only complaint is that it took so long. The Trump Administration produced a transformative deal with Khartoum, but extended haggling on Capitol Hill needlessly endangered the fragile Sudanese government.<br />Sudan’s long-time dictator fell last year, and the transitional government is acting boldly to move on. A quarter century after the country hosted Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, the State Department negotiated an accord to restore the country’s sovereign immunity and lift its state sponsor of terrorism designation. In exchange, the Sudanese government agreed to normalize ties with Israel and pay $335 million to victims of the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings.<br />America’s foes should take note. Sudan was antagonistic for decades and responsible for American deaths. But it agreed to change and negotiated in good faith. It is behaving like a normal country, and its economy will benefit accordingly. Access to international finance, and to multilateral institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, will bring the previously isolated nation new avenues for commerce.<br />The opportunity to turn a terror-sponsoring state into a productive partner doesn’t come often, and the Trump Administration deserves credit for seizing it. So does most of Congress, where the deal received bipartisan support. But Senators Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Robert Menendez (D., N.J.) delayed passage for months, claiming the deal was bad for 9/11 victims’ families. One of the offers they called a compromise included an unrelated gift-basket for trial lawyers.<br />The bill that finally passed restores Sudan’s sovereign immunity generally but allows 9/11 victims’ families to pursue litigation in federal court. The cases could put Sudan on the hook for billions, but they’re unlikely to succeed. The law also includes $700 million in aid to the country and more than $200 million in loans.</td>

      <td>In the 1840s, Dickens didn’tsee how businessmen like his hero were already lifting mankind from poverty.</td>
      <td>No Christmas story except the biblical account of Jesus’ birth has been more often retold or more cherished than Charles Dickens’s “A Christmas Carol,” published in 1843. The reclamation of Ebenezer Scrooge has brought joy and hope to hundreds of millions of people across three centuries. “Scrooge” has become an eponym for stingy or miserly. We write in defense of this Ebenezer Scrooge, not the redeemed one.<br />Scrooge is a distilled caricature of a businessman in the Victorian era: a rich, obsessive wealth hoarder. Working in “his moldy old office,” living in “his dusty chambers” in a building so old and dreary that “nobody lived in it but Scrooge,” he was “a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone.” He strove from dawn till dusk to “understand his own business,” and “with his banker’s-book” he trudged home in the dark “to take his gruel” alone by a dying fire.<br />We meet Scrooge on Christmas Eve, when he is visited in his cold, dingy “counting-house” by his nephew, who urges him to stop working: “You’re rich enough.” The young man begs his uncle to join him in making merry on Christmas Day. Concerned about finding himself “a year older, but not an hour richer,” Scrooge answers that he will keep Christmas in his own way, by working.<br />It should be understood there is nothing unethical about Ebenezer Scrooge. In his view business “is the even-handed dealing of the world,” and “there is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty.” His great failing, in the words of his former fiancée, whom he gave up to marry his business, was that he had become a prisoner of “the master-passion, Gain.”<br />Scrooge’s reclamation begins on Christmas Eve when the ghost of his dead partner, Jacob Marley, visits to tell of his “life’s opportunity misused.” When Scrooge recalls his partner was “always a good man of business,” Marley’s ghost cries out “Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business: charity, mercy, forbearance and benevolence were all my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business.”</td>

      <td>Parties often conduct autopsies after losing elections. Since Democrats and Republicans alike gained and lost so much this difficult and bizarre year, both need sober after-action reviews.<br />Democrats won the White House but not the Senate. They also suffered surprising and significant losses in the House. Republicans have the upper hand in keeping the Senate, gained impressively in the House, kept their redistricting edge by turning back a well-funded Democratic effort to flip state legislatures. But they forfeited the presidency.<br />So what lessons can each party take from 2020?<br />One is that money can’t buy victory. Democrats outspent Republicans in every seriously contested Senate race yet flipped only Arizona and Colorado. Democrats showered $132.7 million on South Carolina’s Jaime Harrison against Sen. Lindsey Graham, who raised $109.3 million. Mr. Graham won by 10 points. Kentucky’s Amy McGrath, a Marine veteran, received $96.3 million for her bid against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose bankroll was $69.9 million. He won by 19.6 points.<br />Money also can’t buy a compelling message. In many races, Democrats had little more to say than that their Republicans opponents didn’t care about people with pre-existing conditions and were lackeys for President Trump.</td>

The International Olympic Committee announced the decision Dec. 7.<br />The other sport to be introduced in France will be breakdancing, which started in the 1970s with African-American and Hispanic street youth dancing, spinning and twirling to hip-hop and rap music. The IOC has been pushing to include urban events like breakdancing to entice younger viewers. But is breakdancing really a sport?<br />The committee has changed its mind on sports in the past. In February 2013 the IOC announced it would remove Greco-Roman wrestling, which dates back to the original Olympics in ancient Athens, from competition in 2020. A massive public outcry ensued, and the decision was reversed that September.<br />Meanwhile, some fascinating and unusual examples of Olympic events have been held and discontinued. Tug of war was an Olympic medal sport starting with the second modern Olympics, in 1900, but was eliminated after 1920. Why not bring it back? Working together as a team to build up strength, endurance and precision perfectly fits with the Olympic spirit.<br />Some events gave out medals that have still never been established as official or unofficial by the IOC. Professional and volunteer firefighters competed in 1900. Angling was contested, with 600 fishermen (mostly from France) participating in six competitions.</td>

      <td>A keyboard masterpiece depends on the complex relationship between sound waves and musical notes.</td>
      <td>Mathematician Eugenia Cheng explores the uses of math beyond the classroom. Read more columns here.<br />Along with my usual chocolate Advent calendar, this year I decided to make myself a kind of musical Advent calendar by playing through a book of J.S. Bach’s “The Well-Tempered Keyboard,” a monumental collection of 24 preludes and fugues. Playing one a day made a perfect fit with my chocolates and the run-up to Christmas Eve.<br />Bach didn’t choose the number 24 arbitrarily. In Western music there are 12 notes in an octave, and for each note there is a major and a minor key, making 24 in total. To understand why there are 12 notes in an octave, rather than 10 or 14, we have to look at the math of sound waves.<br />The pitch of a note is determined by the frequency of its sound wave—that is, how many identical segments of the wave, or oscillations, pass a fixed point in a given period of time. The higher the frequency of a sound wave, the higher the pitch it produces. Harmony in music involves combining sound waves of different frequencies, making use of the fact that some waves reinforce one another while others interfere.<br />For any musical note, the note that goes with it most harmoniously is the same note one octave higher. That’s because the higher note has exactly twice the frequency, leading the two sound waves to oscillate together neatly. The next most harmonious note will be the one with three times the frequency, which in musical terms is a perfect fifth higher—for instance, the jump from C to G, which you can hear at the beginning of “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.”</td>

But Tomorrow?” (Dec. 17): Forbidding natural-gas connections in new buildings ensures that more, not less, natural gas will be consumed to meet the new demand for electricity. Similarly, government mandates for electric vehicles, space heating and cooking will increase the total amount of natural gas burned.<br />Natural gas consumed as a fuel to heat or cook is more than 90% efficient, while electricity produced from natural gas is at best 60% efficient. This means that boiling a pot of water on an electric stove uses 150% as much natural gas as a gas stove. This is before any consideration is given to the inefficiencies of induction heating or losses in transmission.<br />On the other hand, if all U.S. homes were required to burn natural gas for space heating and cooking, the total amount of natural gas consumed nationwide would probably decline, with the added benefit of increasing the proportion of U.S. energy sourced from renewables.

The range of targets—from the departments of Commerce, State and Homeland Security to the National Institutes of Health—could provide Russian leaders with indispensable intelligence and secrets that can be used at a later stage.<br />Ultimately, the hack signals to the West that years of international sanctions haven’t hampered Russia’s global ambitions or deterred its security apparatus from conducting broad-based operations with impunity, analysts say.<br />“It’s always good to sneak into these systems and collect some intelligence that you can use in the future.

      <td>Unusual nature of this recession suggests it could lead to more rapid recovery than others</td>
      <td>Our Covid winter has begun on a grim note: Job growth is stalling, consumer spending is wilting, and a fast-spreading virus strain has raised the prospect of crippling new lockdowns.<br />Yet after this most unusual of years, there are three good reasons to think next year will be better—perhaps much better than you think. It all comes down to the unique character of both the recession and the policy response.<br />Most recessions begin when rising interest rates or stressed financial markets undercut demand for goods and services, driving up unemployment, which further crimps demand. This one began with a natural disaster, like a hurricane or earthquake, which interrupts the supply of goods and services.<br />When a disaster of that sort ends, a V-shaped recovery ensues. But this disaster, the most widespread and longest lasting in a century, isn’t over. There was a partial V-shaped recovery in the third quarter as lockdowns were lifted. But since the pandemic was never brought under control, restrictions and social distancing never ended and indeed have recently tightened.<br />Those restrictions are repressing consumer spending. IHS Markit estimates personal consumption is running 7% below its fundamental level as dictated by wages and salaries, government payments, wealth, interest rates, taxes and demographics. In the 2007-09 recession, it ran close to or above its fundamental level.</td>

      <td>State government agencies will be required to automatically register people to vote when they do things like apply for a driver’s license</td>
      <td>New Yorkers will be automatically registered to vote when they interact with an array government agencies under a new law signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo that supporters say will increase voter participation.<br />The automatic voter registration law, which takes effect in 2023, would require the state’s departments of motor vehicles, health and labor as well as county and city-run social-service agencies to automatically register people to vote when they do things like apply for a driver’s license.<br />If a citizen is already registered to vote, the agency will work with the state Board of Elections to update their voting address when performing any number of other governmental transactions. A citizen must attest that they are eligible to vote, and may opt not to have their information shared with elections officials.<br />Mr. Cuomo signed the law on Tuesday. Assemblywoman Latrice Walker, a Democrat from Brooklyn and the law’s sponsor, said it “puts New York State on the right side of democracy and history by acknowledging years of voter suppression and making the process to register to vote easy, and accessible to New Yorkers.”<br />Eighteen other states and the District of Columbia have enacted similar laws, according to Deputy Senate Majority Leader Mike Gianaris, a Democrat from Queens who is the measure’s other sponsor.</td>

      <td>College essays by Success Academy seniors tell stories of inspiration and heartbreak.</td>
      <td>As a trustee of Tufts University, I saw my share of college essays. More recently, as board chairman of Success Academy, a network of 47 K-12 charter schools in New York that enrolls 20,000 students, I had a bit of an awakening.<br />I read 29 personal statements from Success Academy’s current senior class; 28 of the 29 are students of color; 25 of the 29 will be first-generation college graduates. Virtually all took and passed multiple Advanced Placement exams. The average SAT scores were 654 on math and 611 on verbal, compared with 475 and 485 for a similar national demographic. Depending on one’s view of Success Academy—and charter schools in general—these facts suggest either an aspirational view that ZIP Codes need not determine educational excellence or a cynical view that 2,500 teachers and 20,000 kids and their families have joined a cult obsessed with producing outsize test scores.<br />Beyond the numbers, my first reaction to these essays was that they were all well-written (I even learned a new word: heteroglossia). It is fair to point out that, as a sine laude high school graduate, I am neither Strunk nor White in authoritative assessment of writing skill. Still, I have read enough bad essays to recognize a good one. Uniformly, these essays were clear, concise, grammatically correct and properly punctuated.<br />I’ve spent plenty of time with college admissions directors. They are on the whole thoughtful and committed professionals. Many also have a sardonic sense of humor, which helps when reading and evaluating thousands of essays. One Ivy League admissions director describes how insiders distill recurrent themes to a word or two. “Costa Rica” refers to the propensity of well-to-do high school juniors to embark on eco-tours of Central American countries. “Grandma” points to the lionization of elders—a noble sentiment, but as my friend wryly noted, grandma isn’t applying to college, you are. “Soup kitchen” captures the idea that two weeks’ work at the shelter doesn’t make you Mother Teresa.<br />A Success Academy scholar is as likely to live in a homeless shelter as to work in one. Gap years would more likely be devoted to caring for an autistic sibling than tending Costa Rican flora and fauna. Simple heuristics wouldn’t prove helpful in vetting a Success Academy class for college admission.</td>

      <td>Pharmaceutical companies and Trump’s Operation Warp Speed deserve the vast bulk of the credit.</td>
      <td>With the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, a light has appeared in the darkness. A hard winter lies ahead, but this pandemic will soon be over.<br />How can this be happening only 10 months after the first Covid death in the U.S., rather than the 10 years it took to develop a vaccine for measles? Nine months ago, Anthony Fauci stated unambiguously: “It will take at least a year and a half to have a vaccine we can use.” The public-health community dismissed that as a fantasy. A co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine, Paul Offit, noted: “When Dr. Fauci said 12 to 18 months, I thought that was ridiculously optimistic.” A  New York Times vaccine timeline went further, declaring: “The grim truth behind this rosy forecast is that a vaccine probably won’t arrive any time soon.”<br />Those naysayers have been proved wrong and it’s worth considering why. Let me invite the reader to answer a short quiz. When in the months ahead you are vaccinated, to whom should you be most thankful for making this possible?<br />• The initiative forwarded by the United Nations, Group of 20, World Health Organization and COVAX—an affiliate of WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations—that called for “a ‘people’s vaccine’ available and affordable for everyone, everywhere,” in the words of U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres?<br />• Foundations and donors, including the consortium led by the Gates Foundation that established the CEPI (the “alliance to finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines”) at Davos, Switzerland, in 2017?</td>

      <td>FCC sale of wireless licenses has already hit new spending highs and the total could climb after a holiday break</td>
      <td>The Federal Communications Commission’s ongoing sale of wireless licenses has fetched more than $69.8 billion after three weeks of bidding, a record sum that could alter cellphone carriers’ prospects for the next decade.<br />The auction proceeds have already topped the $44.9 billion raised in 2015 by an earlier sale of midrange cellular licenses, which U.S. cellphone carriers used at the time to enhance their 4G service. Those companies are now investing billions of dollars in the next wave of fifth-generation coverage. The 5G standard promises to speed the flow of data to phones and other wireless devices like personal computers, cars and industrial machinery.<br />The recent bids have blown past Wall Street’s highest forecasts, suggesting that several companies are fighting over the most valuable wireless rights. The 5G auction kicked off Dec. 8 and will pause for the holidays until Jan. 4, when total bids could move even higher.<br />Each bid is swathed in secrecy until the auction process ends. Analysts expect big names like  AT&T Inc.  and  Verizon Communications Inc.  to walk away with a large share of the licenses to match assets that rival T-Mobile US Inc. captured with its February takeover of Sprint.<br />“Mid-band spectrum will be where 5G lives,” said Walt Piecyk, a telecom analyst for research firm LightShed Partners. He added that T-Mobile’s merger with Sprint “clearly put pressure on Verizon and AT&T” to match their rival’s war chest.</td>

In past years, the 32-year-old financial analyst said he shied away from giving the cards because they felt impersonal.<br />“It was sort of a last resort this year,” said the St. Clair, Mo., resident. “Not having the ability to get in stores and see things makes it hard to buy gifts.”</td>

      <td>Consumer spending and incomes could take hit, as business restrictions aim to curb surge of infections</td>
      <td>The U.S. economy has entered an odd sort of limbo—slowing, as it ends an unusually rough year, but with a possibly stronger recovery looming ahead.<br />The latest economic readings, due out Wednesday, are expected to show that U.S. households cut spending in November, which would be the first drop since April, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The Commerce Department report is also projected to show a drop in household income last month, as the effects of federal-aid programs earlier this year fade. A separate report by the Labor Department is expected to show another rise in weekly jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs.<br />Businesses across the U.S. have been forced to shut or scale back operations in recent weeks, as states and cities try to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Economic growth appears to have slowed this winter as a result.<br />Consumer spending—the linchpin of growth in the world’s largest economy, representing more than two-thirds of demand here—has grown more slowly in recent months and could remain weak for the short term.<br />Next year’s economic outlook is brighter. Congress on Monday passed a roughly $900 billion pandemic-relief package that includes a new round of $600 stimulus checks for most individuals and enhanced unemployment benefits. Authorities this month began giving some essential workers and other vulnerable Americans the vaccine against the virus, the start of a monthslong process that could eventually lead the economy to more fully reopen. Some economists think gross domestic product could grow by a robust 5% or more next year.</td>

      <td>Agribusiness giants, startups jockey to pay farmers for capturing greenhouse gases in fields; environmental groups question impact</td>
      <td>U.S. farmers make their living raising crops from the soil each year. Now, some are getting paid for putting something back into their fields: carbon.<br />Big agriculture companies including  Bayer AG ,  Nutrien Ltd.  and Cargill Inc. are jockeying with startups to encourage crop producers to adopt climate-friendly practices and develop farming-driven carbon markets. Those efforts would let retailers, food makers and other companies offset their greenhouse gas emissions by paying farmers for their fields’ capacity to withdraw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and trap it in the soil.<br />The concept envisions the U.S. Midwest’s swatches of cropland doing double duty as a vast carbon sink. Plants’ process of photosynthesis withdraws carbon dioxide from the air, combines it with water and sunlight to produce energy, and ultimately embeds carbon in dirt through roots, while releasing oxygen back into the atmosphere. Soil, if left undisturbed, can retain the converted carbon for years.<br />Agricultural companies, long criticized as environmental villains, say that paying farmers to maximize those natural processes can put the scale of modern farming behind a potential climate solution. Farmers, following half a decade of lean crop prices, are contemplating a possible new source of income that is less dependent on weather and agricultural commodity markets. The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that the agriculture sector accounts for 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.<br />President-elect Joe Biden’s administration also plans to pursue the concept. Mr. Biden said this month that under his administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will direct federal conservation payments to farmers who use their fields to capture more carbon.</td>
