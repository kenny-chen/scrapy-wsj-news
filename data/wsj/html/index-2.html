      <td>The number of death sentences carried out in the pandemic-stricken U.S. fell to a 29-year low in 2020, despite a rise in executions of federal inmates.<br />The overall total of 17 executions for 2020 was the lowest since 1991 when 14 inmates were put to death, according to an annual report by the Death Penalty Information Center, a research organization critical of the death penalty. The number of new death sentences imposed this year—a total of 18 as of mid-December—is the fewest since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976, the report said.<br />Ten executions were carried out under the federal death penalty, the first time that the U.S. government performed more civilian death sentences than the states did combined.<br />At least 11 executions were halted or delayed—through stays, reprieves or reschedulings—because of coronavirus-related precautions, according to the center.<br />Just last month, a federal district judge in Washington postponed the Dec. 8 execution of Lisa Montgomery through year’s end after her lawyers contracted Covid-19.</td>

      <td>Retail sales in November are forecast to decline, ending six months of spending growth</td>
      <td>U.S. consumers have pulled back on purchases and limited holiday shopping in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic triggered new business restrictions, potentially snapping a six-month stretch of retail sales growth.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast that retail sales decreased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in November from a month earlier. The Commerce Department will release the November figures on Wednesday.<br />That would mark the first month-over-month decline since April in the department’s measure of spending at stores, vehicle dealerships, restaurants and online.<br />Expected weakness in automotive sales will likely contribute to the decline, along with “the fact that people are starting to stay at home again,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at consulting firm Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. A rise in coronavirus infections is starting to affect sales at businesses such as restaurants, he added.<br />The U.S. economy continues to recover, but at a slower pace. Hiring growth slowed in November while worker filings for unemployment benefits recently increased. Overall consumer spending, which includes retail and services consumption, has continued to increase, but more slowly than over the summer. Consumer confidence has been mixed, with one survey reflecting a brighter outlook for the economy beyond the pandemic.</td>

Since then, officials have turned their focus to refining an asset-purchase program that began in March to stabilize market functioning and now are focused on stimulating economic growth.<br />The Fed will release its policy statement at 2 p.m. Eastern time along with new economic projections. Chairman Jerome Powell will follow with a press conference at 2:30 p.m., at which he could explain any new policy changes or guidance.<br />Here’s what to watch:<br />At their meeting last month, Fed officials suggested they should provide updated guidance “fairly soon” about how long they expect to continue buying Treasury and mortgage securities.</td>

      <td>U.S. stock futures edged higher Wednesday as investors awaited progress on stimulus talks, fresh guidance from the Federal Reserve and key economic data.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked 0.3% higher, signaling that the broad market gauge may climb for a second day after the New York opening bell. Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.3%.<br />Signs of progress toward a fresh fiscal-stimulus package buoyed sentiment on Tuesday, allowing the S&P 500 to break a four-day losing streak. Top congressional leaders signaled they were inching closer to striking a deal after a day of meetings. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he’s optimistic, fueling bets that lawmakers will craft the new aid package before the holidays and the expiration of several key aid provisions.<br />Hopes for the new stimulus package have become the latest catalyst for a market rally that has sent the S&P 500 index up over 14% this year, despite the economic setback triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.<br />“It is just another excuse for those that missed the rally, or that are bullish anyway to buy into it,” said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. “We know that [a deal is] coming, the signals are pretty clear,” he added.</td>

      <td>Real-estate developers provide much-needed economic activity and land purchases. A squeeze on their balance sheets by the government would have impacts on international markets.</td>
      <td>China’s real-estate developers contributed significantly to its recovery this year, revving up sales and construction activity as the world’s second-largest economy began to shrug off the economic effects of the pandemic.<br />But it isn’t clear whether they will be able to repeat the same act next year. Markets that are sensitive to the conditions in the sector, especially industrial metals like steel and copper, may begin to reflect that.<br />Late last month, China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission chief Guo Shuqing labeled real estate the country’s largest “gray rhino:” an obvious and highly dangerous threat that is tough to tackle.<br />Most listed real-estate developers breach at least one of three “red lines”—specific leverage ratios to avoid—which haven’t been officially announced, but which are repeatedly identified in state media. As of the end of the first half of 2020, only six major developers passed all three tests, according to  BNP Paribas .  Nine breached all three, among them Sunac and Evergrande, two of the country’s largest property firms.<br />In theory, where developers place on the redlines test will determine how much debt they can raise in the subsequent year. And without the ability to add leverage, their ability to buy the land required to finance local governments would be more limited. Analysts at Nomura expect land-sales revenue to rise by just 5% next year, down from 9% this year, the slowest increase in at least five years.</td>

      <td>BP PLC  has bought a controlling stake in the largest U.S. producer of carbon offsets, doubling down on a bet that preserving forests will be key to companies meeting their carbon-reduction goals.<br />The oil giant in late 2019 made a $5 million venture investment in Pennsylvania’s Finite Carbon, which helps landowners sell their forests as carbon sinks. With majority ownership of Finite, BP plans to take global the business of paying landowners not to cut down trees.<br />BP and Finite didn’t disclose financial terms of the latest deal but said that the forestry firm was now part of the energy company’s Launchpad. The unit functions similarly to a private-equity firm by taking big economic stakes in businesses with an eye toward steering them through expansion.<br />“Finite Carbon has the potential to build a global platform for managing and financing natural climate solutions,” said David Eyton, BP’s executive vice president of innovation and engineering.<br />BP itself has been one of the world’s biggest buyers of forest carbon-offset credits, a type of climate-change currency. The company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on offsets to comply with California regulators. They operate a so-called cap-and-trade system that aims to reduce greenhouse gasses by making it more expensive over time for companies operating in the state to pollute.</td>

Mallinckrodt, still profitable, could be an exception, shareholders said in court papers. Stephen Welch, chief transformation officer for Mallinckrodt, said the debt-for-equity swap proposal was the best the company could do as it is confronted with billions of dollars in potential damages.</td>

The Fed’s point man for financial regulation, Randal Quarles, noted recently that the U.S. central bank had sought to join after it had already been engaging with the group on an informal basis.<br />In a statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said “as we develop our understanding of how best to assess the impact of climate change on the financial system, we look forward to continuing and deepening our discussions with our NGFS colleagues from around the world.”<br />The network, which launched three years ago, is a forum for central bankers and regulators to come together and discuss how their institutions can ensure their financial systems don’t worsen climate change risks, and how financial institutions might be able to lower those risks.</td>

      <td>Here are some of the messages of hope that spiritual leaders are delivering during the pandemic</td>
      <td>The Rev. Carmen D’Amico stood before his congregation in Muse, a former coal town in western Pennsylvania, and talked about not giving into despair and darkness.<br />“Being in a pandemic doesn’t mean you stop doing what is good,” he told the members of Holy Rosary Catholic Church on a recent rainy Sunday morning, all wearing masks and sitting in every third pew to keep safe distance. “If you know someone is alone, call them up. Reach out to them. Do you have elderly neighbors who need their leaves raked? Do it. Don’t wait for anyone to ask you.”<br />Simple actions matter, he says. “We need to support each other to get through this. We need to be the light for each other.”<br />Religious and community leaders, who like everyone else have been grappling with Covid-19 for months, need a special message for the 2020 holiday season. People are exhausted by the crisis that they thought would be over by now. Many have lost loved ones and jobs. They miss family and friends they can’t safely visit, an absence deeply felt during a season traditionally filled with gatherings and festive concerts and pageants.<br />Here are some of the messages that spiritual leaders are delivering during a time of distress.</td>

      <td>Deputy attorney general never worked as a prosecutor but has taken a leading role at the Justice Department in recent corporate cases</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who President Trump said Monday would succeed outgoing Attorney General William Barr, is expected to lead the Justice Department in an acting capacity until President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration.<br />Since his confirmation to the No. 2 post in May 2019, Mr. Rosen has taken a leading role on some corporate cases, including the antitrust case against Google. He doesn’t have prior experience as a prosecutor.<br />He will take over the top job at the Justice Department upon Mr. Barr’s departure on Dec. 23. Mr. Barr resigned on Monday. Other Justice Department officials said they didn’t expect Mr. Rosen to deviate from Mr. Barr’s policies. However, they noted he had been involved in sensitive litigation that the White House had an interest in, including a lawsuit against Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, over the publication of his book in June.<br />Mr. Rosen has spent most of his career in the private sector and at several other government agencies. They include the Transportation Department where he served in the No. 2 job before joining the Justice Department as deputy attorney general.<br />In October, Mr. Rosen, 62 years old, unveiled the Justice Department’s case against Google, alleging that the search giant is illegally preserving its monopoly status by engaging in anticompetitive tactics that shut out future innovators from challenging its dominance. “I think we do go through these tech phases,” Mr. Rosen said in an interview at the time, adding: “I think it’s not uncommon that they raise some antitrust issues.”</td>

Those blank-check companies raise capital by going public and can put the proceeds into deals.<br />Group Nine Media is interested in acquisitions that could grow its audience and give it more bargaining power with online advertisers.<br />The venture-backed company, which formed in 2016 through the merger of several digital-media businesses, has already begun buying competitors. Last year, it purchased PopSugar, a women-focused digital publisher, adding its site and web properties to a portfolio that includes animal-focused The Dodo and NowThis, a news publisher.<br />It isn’t clear which company or companies Group Nine Media would target for acquisitions. Group Nine’s all-stock deal with PopSugar valued Group Nine at $600 million, The Wall Street Journal reported.</td>

      <td>The Attorney General was the right man for the job in hyper-partisan times.</td>
      <td>William Barr resigned as Attorney General on Monday, effective Dec. 23, and he’s certainly earned the right to leave early. He has been the right man at the right time for that difficult job, with the principles and toughness to make difficult decisions despite bitter Democrats in Congress and a willful President Trump.<br />Mr. Barr had already been AG once so he didn’t need the title. He took the job in a Washington marked by no-limits partisanship knowing that he would be criticized no matter what he did. But he wanted to clean up a Justice Department that he rightly knew had been tainted by a corrupt FBI under James Comey and political appointees in both parties who lacked the courage or tenacity to take responsibility for hard prosecutorial judgments.<br />His achievements included navigating the end of the Robert Mueller probe while protecting the office of the Presidency from unconstitutional conclusions about obstruction of justice. Future Presidents of both parties will thank him.<br />He was willing to endure media and Democratic smears by taking fresh looks at old investigations. This included hiring U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine how the FBI could decide to investigate the 2016 Trump campaign as a Russian front. His release of documents has helped to show the FBI probe began in partisan scheming and unlawful practices, and Mr. Durham is staying on the job and may have more to report and indictments.<br />Mr. Barr also had the guts to ask another U.S. Attorney, Jeffrey Jensen, to re-examine Mr. Mueller’s prosecution of Michael Flynn. That probe turned up more malpractice and a decision to dismiss charges that never should have been brought. Mr. Barr used the lessons of these misguided probes to impose new rules and limits on political investigations.</td>

      <td>Holding the next AG accountable for how the case is handled.</td>
      <td>Even as Attorney General William Barr prepares to leave office after resigning on Monday (see nearby), effective Dec. 23, Republicans and many on the right are demanding that he appoint a special counsel to investigate the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son, Hunter. The better idea is to make the next AG responsible for how that case is handled.<br />Hunter acknowledged last week that his “tax affairs” are under investigation by federal prosecutors, who are also looking into his influence-peddling via deals with Chinese interests and a Ukrainian gas company. Most of the media ignored the story before the election, and we warned this could create troubles for a President Biden. And here we are.<br />One problem among many with special counsels is that they are often politically unaccountable, wandering into areas far beyond their remit. Robert Mueller’s team never did find proof of Russia-Trump collusion. But they did torment Michael Flynn on an unrelated charge that was unjustly brought. A special counsel can also bury a case in secret for years, and an AG can duck questions by saying that’s the special counsel’s job.<br />The U.S. Attorney for Delaware is reported to have opened a Hunter investigation in 2018, and there is good reason to believe it can complete its work—barring political interference. This would be the preferred outcome, since Democrats would have a harder time claiming any future charges brought by career prosecutors were politically motivated. Meantime, any effort by a Biden Justice Department to transfer staff, dictate outcomes, or shut down the probe would leak and have political costs.<br />A Republican Senate would also be watching if the GOP secures at least one Georgia runoff seat on Jan. 5. The country was alerted to Hunter’s potential legal jeopardy by Senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley, who in September issued a detailed report about Hunter’s deals in Ukraine, Russia, China and Kazakhstan. The Senators continue to investigate and they’d have subpoena power.</td>

      <td>Senate Democrats lay out their green agenda for financial markets.</td>
      <td>Democrats accuse President Trump of politicizing the Federal Reserve, and sometimes not without cause. But look who’s now demanding that the central bank and other financial regulators accommodate their plans to politically allocate capital.<br />The Senate Democrats’ Special Committee on the Climate Crisis recently issued a report detailing how the Fed and eight other regulatory agencies should penalize investment in fossil fuels and promote green energy. They claim financial institutions are underpricing the risk that carbon-intensive assets will become “stranded.”<br />Mind you, their worry isn’t about how climate change per se would devalue investments, which financial institutions already account for. They want a warning about the costs of government climate policies. “Because Congress has not advanced any comprehensive climate policies in the last decade, the market has not priced in the possibility of significant federal action,” the report notes.<br />“This process—or more accurately, the mere realization that this process is imminent—will drive down the value of assets tied to the carbon-sensitive energy, electric power, and transportation sectors, among others,” Democrats warn. “The risk of holding this type of asset, which will lose value in a low-carbon economy, is referred to as transition risk.” In other words, Democrats want to kill your business, so please account for the hospitalization and burial costs.<br />For starters, Democrats want the Fed to use capital and liquidity standards and annual stress tests to make banks—and potentially also insurers and asset managers—price in these unknowable political risks. They want regulators to assign carbon-intensive assets higher risk weights, so banks would have to hold more capital against them. This would discourage banks from financing such investments, while “green” investments would be deemed lower risk.</td>

      <td>President-elect will soon make his choices to head the EPA and Interior Department, among other positions</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden is nearing a final decision on environment-related jobs that are being watched closely by the energy industry as well as progressives who are concerned about Mr. Biden’s commitment to ambitious climate policies and diversity.<br />Mr. Biden is expected to announce as soon as later this week his nominees to lead the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, as well as a senior White House official in charge of coordinating domestic climate-change policies, people familiar with the matter said.<br />Advisers to the president-elect said he hadn’t yet finalized his picks, but leading contenders are emerging. Mr. Biden is balancing several factors, including diversity, gender and geography, the people said, along with expertise in areas like environmental justice, which calls for laws and regulations to treat historically disadvantaged groups fairly. Much of the decision-making is connected, with choices for some posts influencing who gets chosen for others.<br />Rep. Deb Haaland (D., N.M.) is a leading contender for Interior secretary, according to people familiar with the matter. If confirmed, she would be the first Native American cabinet secretary. Activists and progressives are pushing for a Native American to run the agency, which oversees federal lands and the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Ms. Haaland’s stock has risen among some of Mr. Biden’s advisers in recent days. But some Democrats in Congress have raised concerns about losing another lawmaker to the administration because of their slim majority in the House.<br />Ms. Haaland and Biden teams are in discussions, but no offer has been made, according to a person familiar with the matter. Retiring Sen. Tom Udall (D., N.M.), whose father served as Interior secretary, is also among the potential candidates, as is former Deputy Interior Secretary Michael Connor, who also has Native American heritage.</td>
